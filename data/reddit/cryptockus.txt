i thought you were supposed to sell high, not low LUL
@_date: 2019-07-06 15:14:01
in your opinion obviously
@_date: 2019-07-09 15:09:04
if alts go, it will undermine confidence in crypto generally, and bitcoin will be next, careful what you wish for
@_date: 2019-07-04 04:44:34
dead cat bounce right before alt season
@_date: 2019-07-23 20:26:58
my crystal ball says bitcoin will stabilize for a few months while alts recuperate. then we'll get the usual late year bull market
@_date: 2019-07-05 05:17:20
coin still alive after 5 years? probably not a shit coin
@_date: 2019-07-24 01:32:15
well it is kind of going down right now
@_date: 2019-07-06 15:24:39
My opinion is that if alts go, bitcoin will follow, since it will undermine confidence in crypto generally
@_date: 2019-07-06 14:33:25
'one true blockain' you sound like a preacher LUL
@_date: 2019-07-03 14:04:13
pretty sure they started using certain alts that are more 'under the radar'
@_date: 2019-07-09 19:36:08
exactly, if this pump is mostly due to alt flight, it's not a good sign
@_date: 2019-07-22 20:34:09
seems a bit high, also source is probably biased
@_date: 2019-07-07 05:28:29
r/bitcoin is just a bunch of bitcoin acolytes jerking each other off  and giving each other validation and down voting anything that opposes their strongly biased views, oh yeah and memes after memes after memes. it repels anyone who is new and genuinely  interested in bitcoin, it's sad really
@_date: 2019-07-13 14:58:04
she left... (and tried to communicate with me during bull runs, did not reply)
@_date: 2018-09-06 03:52:33
haters gonna hate
@_date: 2019-07-06 14:02:45
if it were dollar flight, it would have bled into alts as well imo
@_date: 2019-07-10 15:56:38
alts about to recuperate, that is what's going on
@_date: 2019-07-03 01:01:47
wrong sub, prepare to get downvoted LUL
@_date: 2019-07-06 13:35:51
all that growth came from the alts value reduced, alt flight basically... it's a bit scary, since it's a move away from crypto in general, bitcoin flight might be next
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:24:14
time to gamble with alts weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
@_date: 2019-07-08 20:38:05
i think it's more complicated than that, go back to school lol
@_date: 2018-09-09 06:33:26
this 'on sale' line after a dump is quite redundant...
@_date: 2018-09-28 23:31:14
wrong subreddit to post this, immediate downvote
@_date: 2018-09-01 00:51:34
it depends on which alt coin you are looking at
@_date: 2019-07-06 13:38:12
it's too late to get rich off bitcoin, but not too late to buy it...
if you want a possibility to get rich, alts are now where to go, more risk, more reward
@_date: 2018-08-29 21:50:57
What if you're a redditor of 4 years and still make useless posts

what was your password, i'm curious
@_date: 2018-05-28 14:43:08
To me, you can't say a coin is centralized, or decentralized.
These terms are poles, each coin residing somewhere inbetween. Some closer to centralized, others to decentralized.
@_date: 2018-05-12 22:20:13
use other exchange
@_date: 2018-08-29 21:51:54
start mining alt coins and convert to bitcoin
@_date: 2018-05-07 00:41:51
wow, an ATM with 3000 bitcoins in it? amazing /s
@_date: 2019-03-26 04:21:25

@_date: 2018-10-19 22:23:27
good point, the pee becomes more concentrated and raises the value
@_date: 2018-10-14 04:08:30
Well, it depends on which alt coin you own.
If you get lucky and pick the right alt coin, you will profit more than just sticking with bitcoin. More risk = larger reward. As simple as that.

@_date: 2019-08-11 14:51:58
give it time, bitcoin was the first, but it won't be the last
@_date: 2019-08-28 22:00:32
but isn't that why 90%+ of us are in this, to make money?
@_date: 2019-08-21 03:55:54
mass adoption? not gonna happen, price needs  to stabilize, and powers that be must have vested interest in having it go mainstream, those two things have a low probability of happening for now and the last 10 years of its existence
@_date: 2019-08-01 06:10:49
that is why speculators will more to alts soon, it was good gambling with bitcoin but those times are gone now
@_date: 2019-08-26 02:41:06
oh it's the ''time to sell'' meme... sell sell sell!
@_date: 2019-08-22 02:17:32
volatility, unregulated(i know it's being slowly regulated, but that process is taking quite some time), fees, ASICs creating centralization of mining, could be shut down if powers that be sees it as a threat to their financial monopoly, ummm lemme think.. relies on powergrid/internet, STILL used for speculation and gambling 10 years on... yeah that's all i can come up with as counter arguments, other than that its great...i know this will get downvoted by bitcoin zealots because i'm in bitcoin sub but whatever, it's what happens when people become to heavily emotionally and financially invested in something, just sharing my opinion... don't get me wrong though i like bitcoin/crypto in general and think it has lots of potential, i mean i wouldn't be here if i didn't think that, but after many years of watching it evolve, these are the main problems imo
@_date: 2019-08-21 04:32:21
not gonna argue with bitcoin acolytes, always leads to nowhere
@_date: 2019-08-01 06:24:08
most alts that survived 4-5 years do have something better to offer, but the fact is they weren't here first and did not benefit as much because of that, that's just life, first come first serve
@_date: 2019-08-31 03:04:14

@_date: 2019-08-24 21:15:02
feeling insecure much?
@_date: 2018-06-02 12:48:25
simple, alt coin = higher risk = high gain/loss potential, don't say you weren't warned, make informed decision, i recommend a traditionnal coin with a little something different, decentralized.
@_date: 2019-08-24 23:09:12
you need to move on
@_date: 2019-08-12 04:25:26
you mean if, not when...
@_date: 2019-08-24 21:16:26
it is kinda going sideways though, not dead but struggling a bit

if time travel exists and they didn't kill off hilter, it can only mean that hitler was necessary evil fo r the survival of mankind
@_date: 2019-08-25 21:35:24
global adoption would have happened already if the technology was ripe, instead it's still used for gambling and pseudo investing while a bunch of alts could do a better job for the transacting with crypto.
@_date: 2019-08-25 21:57:26
im surprised this is getting barely upvoted, its free propaganada basically
@_date: 2019-08-28 00:43:53
i think so
@_date: 2019-06-30 14:45:52
i take this meme as a sign that it's time to gamble with alts
@_date: 2019-08-28 00:41:34
this charts makes me feel good therefor it must be true
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:53:46
honestly, 90% of the alt coins already died in the past 4-5 years... so which ever alts are left today are probably those that will make it
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:43:04
same as usual, greed mixed with distrust of current financial system
@_date: 2019-02-22 22:12:47
can we relax on tim draper quotes plz
@_date: 2019-06-21 15:07:50
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:51:20
if all alts go, this will erode confidence in crypto in general, and btc will be next... look at the bigger picture, not just btc.

speculators eventually get slaughtered
@_date: 2019-06-25 12:29:15
it alts go down... btc will be next imo, crypto is fed by greed and resentment of the current financial system screwing the average folks over and over, nothing else
@_date: 2019-06-28 12:27:55
they won't, r/bitcoin is a meme cesspool
@_date: 2019-02-22 12:04:07

@_date: 2019-01-24 15:20:55
well look at that, a world where you actually need to have the funds saved up when you want to initiate a project, something we can't even imagine, sort of speaks of the current paradigm 
@_date: 2018-11-27 11:17:59
this is actually well done
@_date: 2019-01-16 15:51:02
thank you for reminding us the obvious
@_date: 2019-01-16 22:49:55
i hope people don't associate crypto with alt-right, that would not be good
@_date: 2019-01-16 23:06:36
crypto as a whole need to stick together 
@_date: 2019-01-29 15:33:28
withdrawing 200k in cash.... yeah... like that won't get any attention
@_date: 2019-09-05 11:50:34
how can you be so sure? also those asteroids don't 'split it up into millions of pieces', so you're changing what you said to fit whatever makes you feel good
@_date: 2019-09-05 10:24:15
centralized hashing power is bad
@_date: 2019-09-01 04:45:41
but is it really?
@_date: 2019-09-05 06:23:56
he's just riding the crypto train like all of us saying whatever he can to get attention and make money, maybe he's right, maybe not, just tired of these hypocrites constantly getting posted here like they are some kind of prophet just so the hodlers feel good
@_date: 2019-09-05 12:44:36
no i didn't
@_date: 2019-09-04 06:50:02
they could make it illegal, they could tax it into oblivion, these are the 2 easy ways, shutting down the internet won't happen, or at least it would be very hard to do that... i'm sure they are other ways i just don't have enough imagination/knowledge to think of them
@_date: 2019-09-05 11:52:13
i think this is the most rational reply i got in a long time in the bitcoin sub
@_date: 2019-09-04 15:39:01
bitcoin is also gambling, just less risk, so less reward
@_date: 2019-09-05 12:44:16
@_date: 2019-09-05 10:23:28
that's how the moon was formed apparently, and bitcoin dying is way way way way way way more probably than that
@_date: 2019-09-05 10:27:31
it will probably eventually be replaced by something better
@_date: 2019-09-04 14:22:52
the point that bitcoin has reached a point where 10x profits in a short amount of time are getting rare, perhaps inexistant. alts on the other hand... :)
@_date: 2019-09-05 10:29:08
they are better options than bitcoin in the cryptocurrency universe, it just so happens that bitcoin was first on the stage and is benefiting for that, quite simple really
@_date: 2019-09-04 14:05:18
if you want to get rich quicker, alt coins are the way to go, just gotta pick the right one, good luck
@_date: 2019-09-04 15:39:48
it depends which alt you picked, crypto is still in the gambling stage
@_date: 2019-09-05 12:06:44
@_date: 2019-09-05 09:57:31
doesn't mean it's never gonna happen though

i'm not here to shill, do your own research
@_date: 2019-09-03 10:06:31
if the gov or elites get together they could crush bitcoin out of existence easily... we need to find a way to create some kind of parallel mode of transaction, being a threat to them is not a good idea
@_date: 2018-04-17 07:40:58
bitcoin was the first, it's the main reason why it's the highest valued
@_date: 2018-04-30 13:27:52
I'm curious to see how this will play out. On the one hand, you have deliberate misleading, and on the other hand, you have idiots who didn't do their homework before giving their money away... Who is responsible? I'd say both. We will see who shares the bigger burden of responsibility in the final court judgment.
@_date: 2019-05-07 04:31:31
i predict the opposite, when btc hits 100k, people will start looking at alts to get the same massive gains btc had in the past (which is already what's happening)
@_date: 2018-12-08 16:20:05
you are right, but hodling is easier to be honest 
@_date: 2018-12-08 16:21:20
you made a bet on the internet and expected the other party to be loyal? you're an idiot
@_date: 2019-05-13 10:34:43
that means people are paying more to transfer bitcoins than alts
@_date: 2018-12-08 16:37:46
