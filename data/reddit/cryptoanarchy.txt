Bitcoin DID solve this problem.  A guy with a $100 a month internet connection and a $400 server can accept Bitcoin online without a payment processor and the restrictions.  Try that with Visa/MC.  You can't do it without going through someone who has restrictions.  Ditto for Paypal.

untrue.  It is totally legal.  Straight from the DOL.  
Credit Cards: Where tips are charged on a credit card and the employer must pay the credit card company a percentage on each sale, the employer may pay the employee the tip, less that percentage. For example, where a credit card company charges an employer 3 percent on all sales charged to its credit service, the employer may pay the tipped employee 97 percent of the tips without violating the FLSA. However, this charge on the tip may not reduce the employee's wage below the required minimum wage. The amount due the employee must be paid no later than the regular pay day and may not be held while the employer is awaiting reimbursement from the credit card company.

I think for simplicity that you could let them keep the overage as a balance.  You really want as few steps as possible.  If you want the money back you could ask for it but the default would be for it to stay there.

They have a clause stating that you could not charge MORE for a credit card transaction.  The price shown had to be the credit card price.  You could offer a discount for cash.  That clause is now less effective due to the recent credit card laws past within the past two years.

What planet are you on?  Credit cards ALL charge transaction fee to small businesses no matter how small the transaction.  That fee is almost never below 10 cents and is usually 25 cents or more.  
Most merchants are using Bit-pay and they do not charge fees for BTC to USD and for BTC I think it is 1% or less.  
@_date: 2014-04-27 02:37:18
Look, the Japanese courts are not going to give 200,000 BTC to someone without a bond of equal value.  So many things could go wrong and make things worse for the creditors.  I wish there is someone the courts could trust with 200,000 BTC but so far nobody has proven they can back this deal.
The best thing would be to not sell the coins and distribute them back to the owners and have this done directly by the courts.  They would go farther then you think because a substantial number of people would not claim their accounts.  Unfortunately we know this will not happen.

When you subtract cash from the stock price the PE is ludicrously low.  If AAPL continues to buy back shares under $600 they will have a pretty high EPS next report as the profits are spread over less shares bought at bargain basement prices.

With information from inside of Gox we could find out more.  We could find out the exact person if the coins were taken that way, or we might end up in a dead end with a user who forged paperwork.

ApplePay is much safer then swipe and is ideal for both BestBuy many other merchants for the same reason Bitcoin is.  The transactions are much more secure for both parties.  
ApplePay is NOT a replacement for Bitcoin.  Applepay is not digital cash.  ApplePay is just a more secure contact less system for credit cards.  Applepay has higher fees then Bitcoin and that reason is the reason Bitcoin will grow.

Agreed.  But the current administration of Apple is becoming more like IBM.  Slow to respond and slow to innovate.  They have a HUGE entrenched user base that will buy ALMOST ANYTHING they put out.  The problem is if they keep up this behavior they will slowly chip away at that base.  
I am going to buy an Android phone just for Bitcoin apps.  So basically I will have two phones, one with service and one without.  If Android has improved enough since I tried it last I may be an example of an entrenched user SWITCHING.   This is a trend Apple does not want.

I'm not sure why they think it's fair to halt withdrawals in some coins and not others while continuing to allow trading. All that's happened is people have cashed out with doggie coin
and others without any penalties  while people who did not know are stuck. Now coin prices are distorted depending on whether they are withdrawal or not. In less the queen prices normalize the be no reason for me to ever deposit any more money in there to do anymore trading.

OB could indeed be a replacement for Ebay's old business of selling used items.  It is now getting very difficult for sellers on Ebay to deal with ebays policies that are geared towards new non-collectable items such as up to six month returns and buyer always wins 'resolution center'.  Many sellers have just stopped selling on Ebay now.  
When you add either trusted sellers (proof of burn or time in business) along with reputable escrow services you do have the formula for an Ebay alternative.  The buyer can be protected. 
Remember - Ebay charges north of 10% in fees!  You could have an enhanced escrow that actually did some work for 2% and still come out way ahead.  
@_date: 2014-05-08 19:41:59
Not really.  Maybe in a strict technical sense, but the implications of having ones large trade broken up into hundreds of small ones while having fees rounded up equated to fees in reality 5x.

We can do free transactions with Bitcoin and already the transaction fee is lower then M-Pesa (about 8 cents) which is a great example of a WORKING micropayment system.  Nothing needs to be done.  
A Person makes $5 in a week, he pays 6 cents to move that through Bitcoin.  About 1%.  Sounds fair considering nothing else usable really beats it.  
@_date: 2014-03-16 02:10:04
Again, one could if they did not know common practice wrongly interpret that way.  But it is one transaction and the customer pays the GST.  The business (NO BUSINESS) pays GST on income they receive even if it is not in AUD.  If the business were to sell the Bitcoin later, maybe, but not if it happened as one transaction into BTC or AUD in the companies checking account.

You are not powerless to do anything about it.  You need to find out why you are losing these chargebacks.  Merchants tend not to lose chargebacks that you activly fight and have a tracking # showing delivery.  If the customer says they never got it, file a claim with UPS for your money back.  If you do that EACH TIME it helps you or other merchants as well as you because UPS will FLAG them and require signature on lower or ALL deliveries to that address.  UPS does not like to lose money.  That will slow them down.
Secondly try to find a profile for the type of fraud.  Does it come from one state or geographic area?  If you CALL each customer that orders over a certain $ amount, or in areas of high fraud before shipping that will cut down on those people who say they did not order.   You could also require signature on the first order of a 3 month order so it is obvious they got the item.  
The Bitcoin discount is a good idea but as others have said, it will probably NOT reduce fraud but might make fraudsters stand out more.

Unfortunately that was Dwolla.  And Dwolla fucked it all up.  If they would have hired a few more lawyers, kept dealing with Bitcoin and grew some balls they would have been huge today.  It takes critical mass to start a payment network.  I had just started to get used to using Dwolla for payments outside of Bitcoin after I was introduced to it by eMTyGox.  I had just done a few payments with it unrelated to Bitcoin at that point.  That effect would have snowballed as they were starting to gain real traction just before they basically committed suicide.

This is possible, but this is not what he said.  If coins were stolen they would move as moving them is the only way to be sure the original owner does not move them first.

untrue.  It is totally legal.  Straight from the DOL.  
Credit Cards: Where tips are charged on a credit card and the employer must pay the credit card company a percentage on each sale, the employer may pay the employee the tip, less that percentage. For example, where a credit card company charges an employer 3 percent on all sales charged to its credit service, the employer may pay the tipped employee 97 percent of the tips without violating the FLSA. However, this charge on the tip may not reduce the employee's wage below the required minimum wage. The amount due the employee must be paid no later than the regular pay day and may not be held while the employer is awaiting reimbursement from the credit card company.

The problem is very simple.  Alt coins are almost all pump and dump scams riding on the coat-tails of Bitcoin.  They do this by trying to grab attention and get people to buy while people who have already bought or mined try to get out at a higher price.

Retail is possible without changing the protocol and without waiting.  One can take zero confirms as safely as a credit card right now.  Yes, a business can be scammed, and the rates may be similar to counterfeit bills and fraudulent credit cards. 
A better solution would be a company like Bitpay having a solution that requires the customer to send with a valid transaction fee or wait.  95% of transactions would be proper with the right fee and be INSTANT.  The company could guarantee payment in case of successful double spend for a nominal fee.

Blocks are not full. 1tb a year is doable. Centrality is not having something that is expensive like a $150 4tb hd. Centralized would be something a bitcoin hobbyist could not afford.

That makes no sense.  There is one transaction not two.  Bitcoins in, product out.  10% tax paid.  Not 10% at each step.  It NEVER works like that.

There will not be an adjustment for some time.  It could be as long as 20 days.  Hopefully more miners understand that the profit is on the core chain and come back.  Also some mining calculators don't factor in fees which are almost as much as the block reward right now.

Article from 3 years ago, by a guy who makes his money selling the 'solution' right after the worst attack on OSX.  Nothing that big since.  It does not take a brain surgeon to figure out Kaspersky is wrong on this issue.  OSX is clearly ahead of Windows in security.

1) happens all the time and is really a secret tax on savers
2) has not happened much at all.  The Cyprus thing was the banks running out of money not the government.  The government came up with the solution which was bailing out the banks with the citizens money which is kinda worse then option 2 in a sense.
Bitcoin will be in the future pretty inflation safe.

noscript blocks external fonts until the site is whitelisted.  You could have them whitelisted, but the default is no.

OSX is LESS vulnerable then Windows.  There are far fewer exploits and the security model is similar to Linux.  Linux is easier to properly secure and is even more secure than the OSX.

That is so not true.  People hated Vista because it was slow and ugly.

There is much hate for Apple in this subreddit but Apple is not 'just a tech company' in the same way that the Dutch East India company was not 'just a tea company'.  Apple commands (though not directly) over a million employees and has greater GDP than many countries.  Apple has a payment system that is used more then Bitcoin though not nearly as secure.
Bitcoin should be compared more to the 49 billion dollar valuation of Paypal with of course greater potential in the end than Paypal.  
@_date: 2015-07-20 22:38:39
Windows can be secured enough to be useful.  Just running all the updates reguarly, no flash (fully disabled,uninstalled) and using only Firefox with noscript cuts out 98% of the problems including this exploit.  
@_date: 2015-07-15 00:27:02
True. The half million is the price to be (potentially) allowed to open your doors.  It's very fucked that it is  it an "application fee" instead of the actual fee for the license.   That means if you don't get approved they get to keep your money. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 21:51:11

Yes.   And the attack did not even stop at that point.   Odds are the attacker and the ransom demand were not from the same place.

The FDIC does not stop bank runs, they mitigate bank insolvency.  Most banks have the funds, they just don't have it in cash.  The FDIC comes in when the bank does not have the funds at all and is running a negative balance.

You need to take out currencies like Ripple out of the equation.  Ripple is not decentralized and it has a huge amount of 'premine'.  The market cap is not real in my opionion, it may not even be 1/10 of what that site says. When you take that outlier out, Bitcoin is 95% of the market.

No false claims were made.  Hardened does not equal 'secure'.
IOS is hardened when not jailbroken.  There are exploits but they are rather uncommon in the real world.  IOS is far more secure then Windows and Android, the percentage of compromised devices is pretty low.  OSX is less secure then IOS but still ahead of Windows.  Har

In my opinion the USD would fall by about 20% versus other currencies (including Bitcoin).  This is unlikely to happen as Obama would invoke the 14'th amendment before this would occur.  Before the shutdown I think the 14'th amendment was off the table but with how the house is behaving it could happen.

It is the "shall not be questioned." part.  The president has the legal authority to mint coins and can simply mint million dollar coins and deposit them into the government coffers to pay the bills.

Section 4. The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void.
Basically it gives the president leeway to pay the debt using any available means.  In this case the constitution would supersede the debt ceiling law because it is in conflict with the constitution.
