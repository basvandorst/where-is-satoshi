If you have a planned parenthood, the give out free condoms.  
My cost of living ore kids; 1/6 this. 
I also live in one of the most expensive cities in the most expensive state in the US. 
Because I live in a high rise, some lifts are section 8, (low to no income, some of our racist shitbag HOA elites hate it) a requirement.  The government subsidizes the rent below the poverty line, so even a 1 million dollar 4 bd 2 bath is ~600usd a month for a family.  It’s sad that it’s a lottery, because some floors aren’t even filled.  Some real estate event is always going on in the south conference hall. 
And it’s only gotten more fucked because San Francisco shitheads don’t enforce rent control. 
Fuck most of San Francisco.  Especially when family visits and they want to see the wharf or china town.
Oakland, for a fact, has its own china town and it’s much less congested.  And you can get the same Americanized food here.

So i was curious to this.  (Have a you ever held more than $15,000 in regular checking, see: non HIL savings?) This is a lent “exposure” of assumed funds because I am a platinum member.  When I called to ask they said to look at a recent crypto-fiat sale within the last day.  It was debited and spendable right away. 
I asked why some people say it takes much longer.  The SWIFT network does not declare the transaction as complete, but since I’ve been a black card/high tier member they “assume” it’s gonna be cleared via SWIFT and batches out without any issue.   essentially like when you buy something it says pending.  However, my deposits says pending but the cash is available that second, to withdraw or send to other banks.  
And just a few hours ago: 
I got a Luxury plus Team Lead call: “from my banking telling me to confirm through via my app and call back back the 800 number that’s on the back of my high-lending credit card with an extension in the text so they could verify themselves as not a scam and also that I bought doordash shit for my flu. And a PS4 game.  **It’s a pain in the ass. But I’d rather prove myself then get ripped off.**
I live across the bridge but haven’t been to SF since I caught the flu but door dash and Instacart have SF info/Offices/settlement systems that triggered their high tier account algorithm.

Honestly. Thank you. 
It’s so important to study the past, and even then people keep thousands of BTC on an exchange. 
It is as dangerous as leaving liquid in your brokerage account, it baffles me.  “I deposited 100k today with TDAmTrade” “oh yeah, which stocks or bonds are you thinking” “none, just gonna leave it there”.  
It’s bonkers.
@_date: 2019-10-04 17:36:07
By resemble, it’s literally a clone with some modifications because BTC is open source.  
Look at BCH’s block height: 
That all got mined? From day 1?
That’s bitcoin for relativity.  
You’ll notice that cash is mined slightly quicker because of the fact that it runs so many fewer tansactions. .56 TX per second right now, compared to BTC’s Txs per second: 4.02. 
It’s fools gold. It’s just another fork of BTC.  Most of us chose to ignore BCH despite it getting listed.  
For the lulz:
And litecoin is actively being developed, with constant patches.  They have yet to cease development.  Just look at github or  the speakers at the annual LTC summit in 3 weeks.

I have some thousands of coins that I cannot access because their 2FA/worst customer service has locked me out.  Hopefully I’ll get back in with my weighed ID, email, and password. 
Yes.  My kid threw my phone in the shitter,  but 6 months of trusting their custody of my assets with the worst customer service (including but limited to sending my broken phone to them [???]) is going poorly.  
PSA, do not use Google’s 2FA.  Of your phone sits in the pisser from .10pm to 6:40am, you’re also out of a dick ton of XRP that you bought at .009-.02.

It’s insane to have the WF and BoFA and have next day for some people and now with added fees knowing others wait days. :/
@_date: 2019-10-04 11:57:36
I’m still salty that I can’t get in to my binance because of their 2FA and poor customer relations (at the time). It’s not their fault that my phone went in to the shitter, but I’ve petitioned for like 9 months for acessss and they’re asking me for proof via data on shit like dogecoin and 0x.  
Just use Authy.  They’re (binance) hyper strict in 2FA. 
It isn’t their fault, it IS my dumb drunk ass fault for buying doge and the having my give bathe my phone in the shitter.  I need to prove to them that I traded some BTC for alts on top of sending my ID. 
Now that they have a US office I’m going to repetition my case. I didn’t even know about the .us service til today.

(By sending I assume you mean selling, and it’s a small portion of my cryptofolio)
Because my mortgage, utilities, and car payments aren’t available in via Crypto.  I’m 32 with a wife and kids and a home owner. I still take the little I need to pay bills and lifestyle stuff, etc.   if I was 24 and single I’d use paxful and Gyft for everything. 
I do use cash.app’s BTC for some stuff, but I’d like to keep a couple grand in the bank for bills, and the and 5% of my CC stays on digital wallets, 5% on exchanges, and the rest in cold wallets.   Dividends on stocks or my non-crypto portfolio don’t pay out fast enough to meet all demands of my living in the Bay Area in California. 
I’m not a late investor.  I’m a bit of a whale and have been in crypto since Bitcoin was worth a pack of gum at most.  Pre MtGox, etc.
Not to get too personal here:
My mortgage is 3,200 a month
My car payments (one I paid In full last year) is 450 @ 4.2APR
My utilities [including 2Gbps down internet {r/humbrbrag}] run between 500-700 depending on the time of year. 
Outside expenditures (taking the kids to a Giants/Niners game, wife wants a dress, family outings to beach monthly): 1250
Food/home cooking:  1000
DoorDash/InstaCart: ~150/400 a month
So 8k+ a month without any vesting a month means I’d have to owner draw a 106k+ taxes. 
It is more sensible to invest in dips and sell high like in any of the fiat markets I’ve invested in. 
I want to move to Mexico because in Mexico City my entire lifestyle would be 1/5th of this but as a a business owner I need to stay close to my stores.
Typing all this out made me ponder back to the days of being a fresh out of school SysAd and of running a fuck-ton of compaq presarious at work with mining software only using 35-45% additional cpu long before GPU FLOP computation began mining.   I was a nerd and an Elder Care agency used Windows Server so I could see a graph, of the 150 machines being used, the average cpu usage as a mean whole was 2.2%, meaning I ran another 50% across the server blades and all CPUs (required to be powered on due to mic shifts, etc)

That’s if you keep your BTC on a web exchange like kraken.  
Say you keep it on a hard wallet, you have to send that to kraken in order to sell.  
I would be completely insane to store 1% of my portfolio on an open exchange, despite essentially now being banks and regulated as such.  
But google MtGox and down the rabbit hole of bitcoin infancy shit you’ll go…  If I could personally kick Mark Krapface in the cunt I would jump at the chance.
@_date: 2019-10-04 05:56:55
I’ve been with CB since MtGox and I’d rather pay the cost I am fees than go through proving my high yield trust.  My limits on CB are maxed in both buyers ny and selling, and latterly half a penny to the dollar isn’t going force me to kicker down a few blocks from CB to Kraken.  And if you don’t know this already, Kraken and CB execs and employees do seminars and retreats together.   I am not going to be surprised if Kraken doesn’t either a) follow suite or b) use their custodial power the allow leverage trading since Bakkt is an el-oh-el.

It’s a non issue.  As explained above, my c-to-fiat is in a withstanding state until SWIFT batches my transactions but because I have more than enough in liquid and credit I can treat it like it’s mine even while it’s “pending”.

Creating an insolvent crypto using the same block heights (mirroring BTC/BCX) from the open source code of BTC itself, and hash rate difficulty that requires the same amount of electricity at pennies on the dollar relative to the BTC branch is unquestionably shit. 
Unless all the bitcoin branches that were split for various reasons are powered by a Dyson sphere and electricity and computation power is taken from the sun (BitcoinGold/BitcoinDiamon/(Insert bad maths here) which are already heavily matured, the mining machines are doing too much for too little and anyone pumping hype on any bitcoin shoot off from a specific block is either ignorant or naive. 
The value of bitcoin is reputation and stability, the pitfall is the comp power needed to solve to get to the next block.  Machines get hot.  Heat comes from electricity. The downfall of the shitcoin spin offs using the same block height as a leaping point is wreck-less and arrogant. 
LTC has a much lower hash rate, and eth and some of the tethered coins use a different method such as burning gas as a means to keep operational costs low and viability up.  
I am speaking specifically for those who fork BTC, rebrand it, turn in a few nodes and hope some poor suckers will buy it, never once reading the WP of Sat.

This. We HODL’rs love talking about the benefits of BTC and the blockchain.  
And in case you didn’t know, HODL was ***not*** an acronym for Hold On (for) Dear Life.  It was originally a forum post by a drunk guy warning people to hold many years ago.  Long before the 20k peak. 
He was just drunk and spelt hold HODL.

I’m no shill against kraken. I love their maker/taker fees, and seeing how I can see both the kraken office and CB office from my balcony gives me a sense of security.  She uses kraken, that I helped set up, I use coinbase. 
I’ve learned through this post that my bank lets me access funds still in SWIFT’s ACH escrow.  She cannot.  This is a banking thing, not a depositieering issue.

@_date: 2019-10-04 11:32:43
Through all of this, ironically I spoke to an advanced account manager and in chit chat we spoke on this… it is no way krakens fault.  It’s that I am such a trusted member of my bank that once the output is batched, I can access funds.   She has to wait for it to batch then clear, which is normal. 
If I sell through GDAX/Pro.CB, their referral email says money will be in my bank within 7 days.  It’s a dozen hours max.  
Being that, it’s still not fully complete (SWIFT being SWIFT) but I have immediate access to lending funds.  I looked at my statements and the deposit I drew from literally said pending.  My bank is trusting me before the fiat transaction is fully closed because  I am an ‘elite’ member.

My advice is *never to gamble*.  Small incremental investments that you CAN afford without circumstance.
Your personal situation is specific to an end goal, wether it occurs short term or takes time on a slow run, it's still money that can be lost.
HODL'r here, and I've been buying in dips.  This could be the beginning of something big.  But it is not a guarantee to meet your goal.  That's why I've kept quarterly P/L for tax purposes.
Now, when you, and everyone else on earth buys BTC the price rises, but in a downturn for panic or short sales, it makes the market more volatile.  It has fluctuated over 150USD in 11 minutes.
