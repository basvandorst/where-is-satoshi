1. Will do next week, it's coming.
2,3 It's there, just not in the docs. I will update the docs accordingly. 
At this point, the best way to be notified of the changes/updates is to follow our twitter  Soon an "updates" page will be introduced.
Thanks for the patience.

Fixed it. Thanks everyone for the patience.
Please check again and report here or directly into my email if you see any other problems.

1. There's currently a confusion between what `order_id` and `keychain_id`. I plan to remove `order_id`mentioning and replace it with `keychain_id`. This is because `order_id` is actually and id that the DB sets automatically, while `keychain_id` is something you as a merchant supply, is unique per gateway and is used to derive the address from an xpub. But currently, when querying for order please use `payment_id` like this:
        GET 
    docs: 
2. Fixed.
3. Customers are offered to return to the URL of the website you entered when creating a gateway.

One cautionary note: there's currently a confusion in the API as to what order_id and keychain_id is. When trying to check order status with the following request:
    GET 
use `payment_id` instead, not `order_id`. `payment_id` is returned along with other data when you create an order. Docs:

Good point. We'll be working on an easily available DEMO of both widget and the admin panel. Although, to be fair, the sign up process takes less than a minute and creating a widget after that will take maybe about 3 minutes.

I think it's important to emphasize here that the core of the product is opensource. If you build around our API and we're shutting down for some reason, you just go ahead and install your own version of Gear (straight-server) and use it without changing a line of code.
@_date: 2015-05-08 19:24:27
The main difference is that you don't need to install it on your server, you get a great admin panel to manage your gateways and orders, a nice payment page and a widget.

Ok, thanks for the report, let me take a look at it.

It looks like CoinOfSale doesn't support BIP32, which means they do hold merchant's money. Mycelium Gear doesn't even touch your money, they go straight into your wallet. So there's that. And, I'll trust you on the number of useful features. In fact, we're planning on adding much more.

Bitcoin payment gateway integration takes time and resources. Yes, it's not simple and for once-a-year event it makes no sense to do that work, it's much easier to accept payments manually.
Name is not technically required if you pay with Bitcoin (only if you pay with CC), we ask it to put it on a badge. That's all.

Great, then you're welcome to come. You can even message me on Reddit if you prefer to stay anonymous and not use an email and I'll issue a ticket for you It'd be nice if you could provide an email though because the ticket system we use - Universe - sends tickets by email, but we can workaround that, no problem.
@_date: 2018-06-30 22:45:10
We literally don't have an additional minute this year to bother. And tickets bought with Bitcoin constitute around 5% of all tickets purchased. Be sure we'll take some time and prepare a better payment processing for Bitcoin purchases next year, but please understand it's not easy to run and develop 2 Bitcoin projects and also run a conference with very limited resources - we are still self funded.

Consider it an official statement: WE DO NOT require your name if you're paying with Bitcoin. Hell even some of our speakers are listed under pseudonyms.

You're talking to a person who actually developed an open-source easy to use payment gateway (checkout  - I don't work for the company anymore, though). Sorry to say, but integration is not just that. It's not super easy no matter which software you choose. We carefully assessed our requirements and needs and decided against automatic payment processing.
In all honesty, if a person cares about how payments are accepted and not about the event itself, he probably doesn't really want to go. Which is fine. The world isn't perfect.
Maybe next year.

Like I said, no name is required if you pay with BTC. What is the problem?

We have a smart address reuse mechanism. It only kicks in if we see previous N addresses have not been used.

If you'd like to receive donations and not let people know how much you have, you can use Mycelium Gear widget. By providing Gear with your xpub (read about BIP32), it is able to generate a new address for each new transactions. Those addresses belong to your wallet, but no one (except Gear) will be able to tell how much money you received.
There's also an opensource version of Gear (Straight) which you can install on your own server to achieve even more privacy. However, it doesn't provide a nice UI and widgets.

I was on a crypto-currency panel with Maria at a conference (not a computer conference, mind you)  a year ago so we had a chance to discuss Bitcoin. From what I could gather, she was interested in Bitcoin and open to learn about it more, but, at the time, I believe, she didn't fully understand its potential. Thus, last year, she was talking about how Yandex.Money can do things Bitcoin does, but better and faster. I think, perhaps, she might have changed her opinion, but I don't know for sure. One thing I can tell you, she can listen to people.

Consider using Mycelium Gear: 
We don't keep your money, bitcoins go straight into your wallet.
