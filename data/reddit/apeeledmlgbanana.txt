Wow... mister supportive over here
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:32:07
He supports it but to be able to buy as much as i want to at BitPanda i needed some sort of video confirmation. My dad is not available atm and I would like to buy before two weeks without giving him all the work. What site did you use?

Dont buy bitcoin if you dont understand this... 
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:28:45
Yeah, i bought on monday and have gained 25% already
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:13:38
You need a driverslicense for that though

Example: 1 BTC costs 10000$, you buy 1 BTC for that price. The next day the price of bitcoin went up by 20% to 12000$. You decide to sell your bitcoin for that price and get 12000$ back. You just increased that 10000$ you invested to 12000$. Herby your money went up by 20%
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:53:28
Yeah, already at 850$ but if bitcoin is ever to become a real currency then the fees can’t be so high..

Ok! You own your own booth selling apples. You and everyone else sell apples at the global price, which is one dollar each. You own 1000 apples and therefore you can say you own 1000$ in a way. The next day global apple prices go up to 1,5$ each. You still have the same 1000 apples but if you were to sell them all today you would get 1500$. Now switch out the apple with bitcoin.
