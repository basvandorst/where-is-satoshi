To be completely serious you don't have to sell ever, just buy things using Bitcoin. This is a hard, process but its slowly happening. More and more retaliers will accept Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency eventually.

I have no idea how you see it. How much tax though, let's assume you buy something for 1 BTC are you supposed to send some kind of tax somewher?, how much would it be 0.2 BTC? As far as I'm aware you pay capital gains when you convert to cash, I didn't see any law regarding crypto capital gains in this manner.

So he basically admitted that gold is being centralized, and it is one of reasons that it's better than bitcoin, are we guys going medieval already? All I want is to keep my money on a piece of fuckin paper double encrypted so I and only I can read it, not in some jewish basement protected by the meaningless bill I got from person I don't even know. Hey old man, the future is now!

Well yesterday I had a quick chat with collegue from work, yes he knows I invest in crypto, and yes he is a stock market trader! He read some financial, stock market expert saying "that Bitcoin is following the same pattern gold once did, and that bubble is going to pop soon" Remember we had a longer talk about crypto like month and a half ago and he seemed interested back then, even asked me what to invest into. I was about to suggest him Monero, back then hovering around 40$ but hate giving advices about other people money, especially if you know them, well guess he would have different opinion now

Pole here, never felt more encouraged to get more crypto. Thank you banksters!

The funny thing is , if noone ever used Bitcoin it would be worthless now. Transfer your fiat to crypto and use it as much as you can, that's how you help yourself.

No it's not! It's a legitimate reason why the currencies  died out. If you want Bitcoin to function make use of it, if you are about to spend money anyway just use a Bitcoin instead it's that simple, how else are we going to make it more and more relevant. What I agree with though is - Don't panic sell, if there is a dip be strong! Big players are coming and they will try to control it bouncing the price up and down so they can accumulate and manipulate the market.
