It’s because when you buy / sell on coinbase, they basically place a limit order slightly above / below market to ensure the order goes through. If you want more control over your sell / buy prices, consider using GDAX, which lets you place limit orders with prices of your own choosing.

Merry Coinmas to all, and to all a good night!

So ... buy for $3500 on another exchange, sell on GDAX for $9500? Could it really be that easy?

Mom rats, on the other hand ...

It was glitching and not showing off and on, but I just kept tapping different time intervals until it finally rendered correctly.

Phew, that was a wild ride.

This is the right response. Luck is part of it, and if you know nothing about the underlying, it’s all you have.

Ha ha thanks for this, took the edge off.

You’re welcome! The only thing about GDAX is that you can’t buy straight from your bank account. You’ll need to pre fund your USD wallet, which can take several days if you do it via bank  transfer. So coinbase is definitely more convenient, especially for the impatient, but you pay for that convenience in both higher fees and worse buy / sell prices. Good luck to you!

I feel bad for anyone who bought over the market average. How did you get a free BCH coin anyway?
