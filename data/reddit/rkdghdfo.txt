1. I spoke with Korbit multiple times. They said while some people are able to make deposits now with the virtual addresses made for them prior to December 21st, most people cannot, even though they had updated their deposit addresses to the shinhan accounts. They said that not being able to make deposits is controlled by shinhan bank and some accounts are able to while most are frozen. YOU must be lucky because myself and at least 50 other people in a Bitcoin kakaogroup cannot do KRW deposits on Korbit.
2. News letting people know that everything is not 100% A-OK is FUD. GTFO. You sound like Trump's tweets they say everything is perfectly fine.

This includes:
- Foreigners with permanent resident status
- Foreigners married to Koreans
- Everyone who is not a Korean citizen who legally have bank accounts, credit cards, and jobs in Korea

What about this:
What's the point of keeping exchanges open if banks refuse accounts? There seems to be a lot of conflicting reports out there.

Coinbase is the only exchange that would verify me without a DNA sample and a severed hand for fingerprinting. Where else can I go? Some people use coinbase because they got no other options (ie. US expats who work outside the US who don't have US mobile number or utility bill for KYC verification).

I know this article is complete BS. Just wondering what you would say as a counter-point to the author.
I've seen these "Bitcoin uses more electricity than Ireland" posts circulating on social media.  What are some good counter points to educate the masses on the FUD?

Korea is banning all resident and non-resident foreigners from being able to deposit KRW into exchanges. 


I've lived in Korea for 10+ years, married to a Korean, and have a Korean green card. I can do everything a Korean can do except vote for the president and make deposits at exchanges now. Fucking bullshit.
@_date: 2018-01-22 03:22:57
No one said anything about coins being stuck. Are you retarded bro?
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:56:22


























How in the world would YOUR bank know about an exchange's  policy that has only been announced within last 24 hours? Call them again, tell them about this announcement and see what they say.
EDIT: Formatting
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:19:36
I don't think some guy's twitter post saying someone they know says there is no ban is a credible source. Also, other sources saying South Korea will not ban Bitcoin are from December. Call it FUD or not, THIS is what is in the media right now. And unless your uncle if President Moon Jae-in himself, there is no reason to believe otherwise.

I've been trying for a better part of 3 weeks trying to get my Gemini account setup.
As an expat working outside the US, it is pretty damn hard to open an account on these exchanges due to KYC policies. Coinbase, despite its shortcomings, let me open an account with my US bank account pretty easily.
@_date: 2017-02-02 14:51:21
 Bits would be great for Koreans. Simplified $1 = 1,000 Korean won. Which would then make 1 bit roughly equal to 1 Korean won. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 01:05:45
1BTC limit on bitsquare is what keeps me from using it. 
@_date: 2017-02-12 11:04:30
Both Coinbase and Gemini follow the same regulations. Why is Gemini so much harder to get verified than Coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:40:22
Korean exchanges are ~$200 USD higher than US exchanges.

Maybe users cant pay for goods linking their exchange account. Kind of like how purse.io let's you link a coinbase account for purchases.

What is the mm in $3mm? 
@_date: 2017-01-26 04:27:27
Nope.  99% of the population don't know what Bitcoin is.  Also,  mobile payment and domestic remittances are incredibly easy and instant. Banking fees are almost nonexistent. There is no reason a Korean needs to use Bitcoin.

Looks promising, but "Our API provider blocks some popular verification code messages." Thanks for the suggestions!

For sure.  Turbo tax is pretty good.

I remember reading a safe deposit box at a bank is not a good idea. Some banks will confiscate the box if there is no activity for a certain time. Would suck to leave it there thinking its safe and then 5 years later find out it was confiscated due to inactivity.

Korean exchanges have not opened BCH deposits or withdrawals. So, everyone who got BCH from the fork in Korea can't do shit with it. What do you think will happen on an exchange if a large number of BCH holders can't deposit nor withdraw their coin? The price will be inflated due to people buying up the limited number of coins that are actually liquid (that the exchange buys/sells itself).
Once BCH deposits/withdrawals open up on Korean exchanges, BCH will drop like a rock.

@_date: 2017-01-06 00:13:16
Sure, the article is a bit old. The lesson here is never ASSUME that safe deposit boxes are safe. One should check the laws in their area to be sure they are protected.

I sent money from my US bank account to my international bank account. The wire left but never arrived. Took about a month for BoA to put a trace on the wire, find out where it went, and get it processed. After all that trouble, no fees were refunded.
Didn't matter to the bank at all that the money was extremely time sensitive and their F up cost me a lot more. Just the fact that had to out a trace on a wire transfer to find it is just ridiculous.

As someone living in South Korea I'm very skeptical of that article. This is a country where banking still requires one to use Internet Explorer with half a dozen activeX security programs installed. This is a country that shuns Google and Microsoft. Korea uses Naver for Search. Hangul instead of Microsoft Office. And Kakaotalk instead of WhatsApp/Facebook Messenger. Korea loves to have their own ecosystems and there is no way they will embrace Bitcoin unless they can impose their regulations/restrictions on it.

I think bigger blocks wont be effective similar to induced demand for traffic. Using transportation as an analogy, we should be using "mass transit" like infrastructure to handle smaller transactions.

Wouldn’t Bitcoin be worth zero if it’s security were compromised? Don’t see how it could be worth anything if private keys were rendered moot. 
Very highly unlikely that would happen, but never say never.
@_date: 2018-03-12 09:12:42
Biggest question would be, how would you report those purchases as far as your tax returns go. More more your spend, the more likely you are getting some tax money returned to you. But, that won't happen if you can't report your purchases like you can with credit or cash (using Korea's Cash Receipt system).

Hey there, thanks for getting in touch with me. I think what you guys are doing is great and I hope you will grow bigger and bigger. My intentions were not meant to put down your community. Wish you guys the best of luck.

And these are only from the first couple pages of results. I haven't even touched the Daum cafe Bitcoin communities.
Do you need more proof??
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:21:09
Go to Naver.com and do a search I their cafes (online communities) using Bitcoin in Korean (비트코인).
Will see a long list of communities with tens of thousands of members.
Seriously, how can anyone believe the largest Bitcoin community in a city of 25 million people would only have around 1, 600 members??? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:11:00
Much props to your efforts. However, I don't believe you are the largest Bitcoin community in Korea. There are Korea groups far larger than yours.
Please do not mislead people.

I wouldn't say never. Technically, someone who can hack private keys could effectively shut down the Bitcoin network.
Extremely unlikely with current technology but I wouldn't say never.
