Interesting how you don't call it a loss because you still have "profit" on your initial investment. You can't call it profit if you haven't realised the profit. It works both ways.
@_date: 2019-07-03 21:26:17
Thanks for that - it’s restored some sanity at least!

What does number of days have to do with whether or not a majority have made profits? That’s not how it works.
@_date: 2019-07-02 09:31:00
It is, it’s an absolute circle jerk comment with no real basis in fact. And I’m a long term holder/user of Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is currently more than 50% of its all time high. Those are considerable losses.

‘Majority’? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:53:05
You don't understand shorting - just because you're potentially long-term bearish doesn't mean you can afford to or want to risk yourself financially with a short position.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:11:47
Agreed. But surely you can see this is a massive blocker to widespread adoption? Your entire financial health is permanently at risk - people don't even back up their photos and files these days. Let alone their entire wealth.

All this bashing of Apple Pay by Bitcoin fanboys is coming across really pathetic. The two aren't in competition, it's not a comparison.
And oh, iCloud wasn't compromised, the weakest link in the chain was - the user. Same could easily happen to a non-hyper-paranoid, unsavvy Bitcoin user.
@_date: 2014-09-12 16:06:18
Making the statement technically correct.
@_date: 2014-09-10 21:00:19
It's not really Bitcoin vs ApplePay though is it. It's not even Bitcoin vs contactless payment cards, phones and wearables. But for the sake of argument...
We have a false dichotomy going on here just so the Bitcoin argument has more weight. There is no denying that the reason why contactless payment is taking off (not just Apple Pay) and it's because it is a service built on top of what people already know, understand and has a fantastic user experience. Bitcoin isn't quite there yet and yeah sure you *could* send a Bitcoin by SMS, but would you dare?
Lot of work needed before it is feasible for mainstream adoption and an actual competitor of contactless payments.
Disclosure: I am a Bitcoin holder, Android phone user, Macbook user and an iOS developer. Hopefully I don't get downvoted as a fanboy of anything. I just don't see why we are having such a binary debate.

iOS has the lowest percentage of malware than any other mobile operating system. Malware snagging the camera image is so unlikely due to the nature of the iOS security model.

You forgot something, it isn't Bitcoin vs ApplePay, it's not even Bitcoin vs Contactless Payment. Why is the comparison even being drawn?
@_date: 2014-09-03 14:07:12
What a story! Glad it turned out ok.
@_date: 2014-02-23 17:53:08
Why are they referred to as ATMs? Depositing currency and getting Bitcoins (or any other currency back), is not the function of an ATM. That's an exchange!
Bitcoin doesn't need an ATM, you do not deal in that way. These things need to be renamed to get rid of any ambiguity or confusion.
@_date: 2015-05-12 10:20:53
Which is actually a problem that needs solving - Bitcoin being difficult to understand will limit its success, wide-spread adoption and long-term success.

I did this once, and my floss didn't smell bad at all afterwards. I was just  covered in blood. I try to do it every day now though, and the bleeding stopped pretty quickly. Surprising how quickly the gums adapt (and unadapt) from flossing.

Point taken, could probably have omitted that bit considering I'm a holder, I even held a long position on Bitcoin today. I enjoy playing devils advocate so it was nice to not get flamed on r/Bitcoin for saying something that could be deemed negative.

It could, emphasis on could.

You are now gambling with Bitcoin, a highly volatile, difficult to predict, fluctuating commodity/currency/store of value - a.k.a speculating.
EDIT: Jesus, this subreddit - constant downvoting with any perceptibly negative comments about Bitcoin. I think I'll stick to Nothing in the above sentence is incorrect.

Yeah and they won't use something as complex as bitcoin to do it, they'd revert back to money or other markers for IOUs. 
This wallet is cool, but just a gimmick.
@_date: 2015-05-12 12:39:06


Most people don't understand how they work, no. But it isn't necessary to know how they work in order use one.
Using Bitcoin and keeping secure requires quite a decent amount of knowledge and research. An amount that most people just aren't willing or able to do. This will prevent widespread adoption - everyone can get onboard with chip and PIN and a bank account, Bitcoin needs more stable services around it to enable this kind of ease of use.

I just added my account once (in a few seconds) and now I use Apple Pay. Meaning my money is never tied up in a gift card and/or permanently connected to Uber. 
I don't understand why using a bank would be a pain? Care to elaborate?

I see! Fair point. Out of curiosity, does your job pay cash? 
@_date: 2016-11-03 17:48:19


I didn't say that. I'd like to see your justification in why Bitcoin is much safer than "a lot of traditional business investments", i.e. bonds.
@_date: 2016-11-04 08:58:52
Then you don't understand investing.
@_date: 2016-11-04 13:29:38
You really do love straw-manning don't you? We were discussing generic risk not my investment preferences.
@_date: 2016-11-03 10:04:24
You do realise Bitcoin has had bigger drops before and the technology hasn't changed? I am an advocate of Bitcoin but to see it as less risky than traditional business investments is ludicrous.
@_date: 2016-12-14 15:09:40


Uh. Nope.

If everyone who sold BTC at $30 each all those years ago didn't, the price of Bitcoin wouldn't be what it is.

This is actually my first time viewing the source for Bitcoin. What's the general consensus among the contributors? Is it considered well-written/easily maintainable? A 7000 line main file seems pretty ludicrous.

Wow! Nearly a 3,000 line main file.

How do you know the price of bitcoin is cyclical and headed upward long-term? Oh you're basing it on past performance, okay then.

Why would a blockchain improve supply chains or make them more efficient?
What I'm after is why would blockchain and its immutable trust approach be a better solution than what is currently in place? But feel free to deflect the simple questions.
@_date: 2018-07-07 17:20:08
Definitely a use case, I agree. But supply chains seem to be operating just fine, no?
@_date: 2018-07-07 18:45:40
Same, for supply chains and logistics it's very neat. I just don't yet see a reason why blockchain outperforms the existing solution when trust isn't exactly a problem.
@_date: 2018-07-07 09:52:31
I didn't say that big companies haven't started implementing the tech. But there are very few use cases for blockchain where an existing technology wouldn't be better suited. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 16:55:15
Tell me what service demands (and benefits from) an immutable (trustful) decentralized system of record that isn't satisfied through recognized authorities. Excluding cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2018-07-08 09:07:48
Nah it just powers a large proportion of databases around the world. Nothing special.
The end consumer doesn’t care (and shouldn’t need to) what technology is used, only what features are provided. Blockchain is being used as a buzzword to raise venture capital.
@_date: 2018-07-07 08:42:12
Blockchain is a buzzword technology at the moment and is being shoe-horned in to every solution possible. The majority of these blockchain start-ups would function just fine, if not better, with another technology.
Since when did people care what underlying technology was used for a service? You don't see start-ups bragging on their homepage about using SQL. Use what is best for the problem, not what is most popular or en vogue.
@_date: 2018-07-24 08:12:05
Literally not true.
@_date: 2015-02-17 10:57:32
Obviously it is linear to the number of transactions... but the measuring the blockchain growth over time it is exponential.
I joined Bitcoin at a 4GB Blockchain, since then it has grown by 600%. Prior to that in the same period it was nowhere near those figures due to much less use.
@_date: 2015-02-03 16:59:15
Thanks, I understand more clearly now.
But this would introduce the problem that Bitcoin is potentially made up of more speculators/holders (who are waiting for it to be worth $50,000 a coin) than people willing to use it at merchants. And for 1 billion people to adopt it and for the price to rise accordingly to allow for the 1 billion people to use it requires people not to hold it to the death.
@_date: 2015-02-03 11:40:51
If a Bitcoin is worth $1000, it breaks down to 8 decimals places, more than enough for it to act as a store of wealth...
Saying it would need to be worth $500,000 a coin **just** because there is 1 billion users is misleading.
@_date: 2015-02-17 09:05:26
The blockchain is already bloated without any other additional use case. It's already becoming horrendous with its exponential growth.
@_date: 2015-02-03 11:07:32
I don't understand his point. Does he not know that Bitcoins breakdown to 8 decimal places? Just because potentially a billion people will use bitcoin does not mean at all that it will increase in price.
@_date: 2015-02-03 19:47:46
Replace when with if and I completely agree.
@_date: 2015-02-17 17:01:11
Wallets that use a centralised blockchain are a workaround (web wallets), but obviously defeat the point.
Hopefully someone a lot more qualified can answer because I am interested as well.

Banks offer copious amounts of security on their apps and websites, too. And if you lose money through fraud, they will still reimburse you.
