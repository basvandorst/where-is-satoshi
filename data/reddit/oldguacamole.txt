I do really think it’s a good time to buy my friend, but I’m just a non-professional investor so it’s totally up to you to decide when and how much.

I don’t really think it’s going further thank 4K for more than a few hours and a couple times. It takes some time to gain momentum and I think it probably will go back around 3750 at least one more time to get strong enough like to surpass 4K border for once. We will see my friend, we will see...

Tampoco exageremos... Sólo ha sido una “pequeña patadita” al diccionario por la cual alguien en la RAE se estará retorciendo de dolor. Nada más... ��

I highly doubt Libra becomes a leader crypto asset, given the way Zuckerberb cheated their Facebook users not long time ago. Another shitcoin in the bucket.

And tell them TO HODL!!!

Honestly, this document is quite confusing and I would totally understand some people's frustration related to this.   
"El Dr. Craig Steven Wrigt, más conocido como Satoshi Nakamoto..." I would totally understand he may have earned that nickname because of his background  (or maybe he just paid for it as somebody here said) but I honestly don't know what the hell is doing SO CONTROVERSIAL nickname in an official "diploma". I honestly think this 100% responds to a marketing strategy.

Yeah, Coinbase shows “an error has occurred”. EDITING: I’m in. Looks like it was a temporary issue...

Yep! I’ve got exactly same version and build than you. Hopefully they provide a solution ASAP.

No worries, Vegeta will go back soon... even stronger!!!!

No solution (as far as I know) other than wait for an update and use another ways to view your currencies like HODL. Sorry, buddy.
EDIT: Go to settings and send your feedback. That could be te only way to put some pressure on them due the 10k bitcoin important event.
