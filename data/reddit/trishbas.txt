Nice. I put a sticker in my shop window around nov 23 and on the 25 a guy bought a jacket laying in bitcoin. I was surprised at how fast it was. 
I’ll be getting a few of my neighbours on board soon

I’ve been using blockchain.info merchant app but would love to hear other recommendations if you have them. No need to transfer into fiat. 
No issues with the app I’m using now but always down to try something else.

If you don’t have a credit card or bank account to link your best bet is probably an atm. I’m sure you can consult google to find one in your area.

I imagine it will look similar to what we say after American thanksgiving. Most people sat around the dining table and talked about bitcoin. Lots of people will be spending Christmas money on bitcoin - I know I will.

A friend of mine posted on facebook years ago that he finally bit the bullet and bought 1 BTC for $50. I was intrigued but never bought any. Fast forward to hearing AA on JRE and I still never bought. There was never an easy way for me to buy so I just recently started accepting it as a form of payment at my business. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:56:00
I started accepting it at my toronto business last week and already processed a transaction! I’m hodling tho so no need for a merchant account that transfers to fiat. I used “blockchain.info merchant app”.
I believe it creates a new QR for each customer and transfers to a different wallet. Really easy to accept payment if you have staff working and processing sales for you.

I sent $1 CAD to my brother on Nov 26 for .17 fee from my blockchain.info wallet to his breadwallet. I’ve never used Coinbase but that with the crazy volume we’re seeing today I’m not surprised the fees are ridiculous.

I use “blockchain.inco” merchant app. Good if you just want to hodl 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:24:26
I accept bitcoin at my retail store in toronto and when people see that they want to spend their bitcoin there but the fees are what’s holding most people (myself included) back. 
I offer a discount to anyone who wants to pay in btc and I don’t convert to fiat so 9/10 times what they paid has gone up substantially in a few days eating up that discount I offered.
As long as they replace the bitcoin the spent with me right away there is no loss. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:49:34
You gotta water it 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:51:35
I’ve haven’t purchased anything yet but my first few bits were from accepting bitcoin at my store. Later I checked the address and it looks like that guy regularly buys things with bitcoin and then immediately replaces the bitcoin he spent. By doing that he doesn’t really lose out on anything. He would have spent $80 CAD at my shop anyways. Why not spread the excitement and support small business with it? 
Sure, that $80 has now more then doubled but it only positively impacts me. I doubt he even thinks about it.  I’ll never forget that dude. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:30:42
I put a sign in my window a while ago and do a couple transactions a week. Less now obviously but still the most important thing is it gets a conversation started. this week I told a couple people that I woulnt accept their payment in btc because the fees are astronomical but I was able to give them some good videos to watch and hopefully educated people who just bought on hype alone. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:57:39
Can’t beat that - it’s all yours
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:39:49

I use blockchain.info merchant app to accept payments at my store which goes into my blockchain wallet. Should I not? I don’t need to change the btc into local currency-I’d rather hodl but if there’s something better that anyone knows of I’d love to see what the suggestions are. Didn’t find much when I was researching and then I just stopped cause it works for me now.

Not relevant. It will be exciting when bitcoin transactions meet and then surpass visa transactions. Bought a coffee with visa yesterday - will buy with bitcoin tomorrow. (Like the tomorrow of tomorrow. Not actually tomorrow) hodl

I own a shop that features only hyper local, handmade goods called Bastone &amp; Co in toronto and just accepted my first bitcoin payment on Saturday. It was my first BTC ever. 
When I put the “we accept bitcoin” sign in the window On Friday I really only ever expected to start conversations about about it and growing awareness. I didn’t ever think someone would actually pay for something anytime soon when really we have no idea where it’s going. 
I hope that guys girlfriend likes her shirt cause who knows what that $88 CAD is gonna be in bitcoin in ten years from now. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:14:24
I run a shop in Toronto that features handmade goods from over 35 local makers and today we processed our first sale using bitcoin as a payment.  
I just put a "We accept bitcoin" sticker in the window yesterday and didn't expect anyone to make a purchase this quick at all. Mostly I just wanted to start a conversation with people but couldn't be happier. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:24:17
I haven’t really looked into what system is the best or even how many there are available but I downloaded the first app I found. It’s called Blockchain merchant on the App Store. Is it the best? I have no idea. I’d love to hear what other people are using. 
To be honest, I really didn’t think anyone would actually purchase anything from me using BTC. I just downloaded it just it case! Ha  
It worked just as I would expect any payment processor to honeslty, If not better. Would love to see how square integrates it. I’m in Canada though so who knows when we’ll see that over here. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:26:02
My grandmother wants to buy bitcoin for all her grandkids for Christmas. She bought $100 CAD worth about a month ago and through she doesn’t really understand it she feels like she doesn’t have to to think it’s the future. Hoping to put together some good videos for her to watch.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:17:01
Specifics about the shop...? Well, the way the shop came to be is kind of a long short story which I’m always happy to tell if someone wants to hear but I’ll save that.  
The concept in which we operate is pretty simple though not really overly that common yet.
The store is called bastone &amp; co and we feature product lines from over 35 Toronto based makers. Everything has to be made(not just designed) in toronto - the closer to the actual store the better.   We sell candles, jewelry, furniture, home decor, plants, hand stitched leather wallets and bags, clothing, pins, cards, candy, soaps, cbd tea, zombie gnomes, and everything in between. Plus we have a rotating art gallery in the back featuring new artists every few weeks.  
Basically, each artisan pays a small monthly rental fee ($200 - $500 dependant on space) and in return gets 100% of their sales. So, no 50% markdown for wholesale, no consignment, they don’t have to work in the store, or build a display, they can price their products how they want, and bring in whatever products they like.  
Really, I just threw that sticker in the window hoping to have conversations with people about bitcoin cause I think it’s the future. There was never a moment where I thought the second day I had the sticker up I would actually complete a transaction with it!   
Since Friday I’ve had a couple dozen conversations with people that have seen the sticker and asked, “bitcoin? I’ve heard that before. What exactly is it anyway?”   
I feel like educating people about it is just as important as accepting it as a form of payment as a small business. That being said, I don’t really know shit and it’s amazing to speak with people that know way more then I do. If you’re ever in the queen west neighbourhood come by 913 queen west. We’re across from trinity bellwoods, beside white squirrel. :) 
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:55:57
It would be amazing if you did!  Honeslty, even just to talk about bitcoin. I’ve only just started to scratch the surface over the last few weeks and it’s all been me just listening to podcasts and YouTube videos. I’d love to have some real life conversations with people about it. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 08:39:08
I process bitcoin transactions at my store at least bi-weekly. A lot of people who have it are excited to spend it. Just buy more bitcoin right away to replace what you spent and you don’t lose.
@_date: 2018-02-22 07:30:11
It is realllly strange. A little scary cause the majority of my btc is in there. Not a lot but still. I guess we’ll see at 10:23 tomorrow.

I run a brick and mortar shop in Toronto and I accept Bitcoin there... I always recommend anyone who spends BTC with me should replace it right away.
And that's what I do when I spend it myself. If we moon to 100K tomorrow I literally don't care that I spent a couple satoshis on a pin cause my balance never changed.

That’s what weird...I haven’t entered my pin in wrong. Haven’t even entered my pin today. I usually use Touch ID anyways. Worried something weird might be happening.  
My key is on paper safe and has never been online so that’s fine and my phone has been on me all day with no chance of someone getting a hold of it and trying to login.  
It’s all just a little odd.
@_date: 2018-02-22 05:54:40
Never entered my pin once today.... I have the key obviously but haven’t tried to reset it yet. Wondering if this has happened to anyone before? 
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:47:45
I guess it depends on the business owners cash flow and wether or not they want to have bitcoin. Personally, 80% of the bitcoin I have is from accepting it in my store but I probably would have bought that much anyways. I’ve accepted it when it was $8000 and I’ve accepted it when it was $18,000 but I don’t really care... it’s a risk I’m more than willing to take. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 00:55:09
So nothing happened... Next day it was fine. I emptied the wallet into a paper wallet after that though
