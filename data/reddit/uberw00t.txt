This is what vos is trying to reduce. The distrust in exchanges. They are trying to play by the books and follow all rules/regs/laws but cannot due to the ignorant commerece systems in the US. Im canadian so this wont really effect me, but I am more then happy knowing my exchange would rather not do business somewere then do it and not give a shit about the law.

Just so its clear here, I should join a pool and hope to get lucky? Is it more or less profitable (on average) to join a pool? Obviously solving a block on your own is the ideal situation but to my knowledge that time has looong since come and gone for the average miner.

Just having some dinner first before I really get into it tonight. Some brief reading on my lunch break leads me to think I can see Data off poloniex, but actual trading is restricted to the gdax platform, meaning I can only trade btc,ltc and eth with medved? Is that correct? I hodl my btc but I like to try and day trade alts. Not very good at it but I enjoy it non the less. If what I said it correct, any time frame for actual trading support for poloniex?

Thanks. At work now but I'll check it out later tonight. Sounds like it's basically what I'm looking for.

That's what I'm thinking. It seems like a very obvious thing to have. Surprised exchanges don't have this. Maybe not by default, but something a user could turn on once they agree to understanding how the hotkeys work. I can't be the only one who would like a system like this. Im sure its out there, I just cant for the life of me find anything.

lending option on poloniex maybe? Ive thought about doing it. Current rate is very small .0046% compounding every 2 days if you stay on top of it or use a lending bot.
