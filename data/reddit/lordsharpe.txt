Not a fake post, I swear.
So the benefit is that bitcoin can be modified? Ok, I can get behind that. Open source is cool. But bitcoins limitations seem to be pretty fundamental, and since bitcoins value is essentially tied to its core concepts, changing them could have major consequences on a large scale, right?
And, ironically, IPv4 DOESN'T scale. Thats why we are dropping it.

I can make fun of the cult-like behaviour of the community while being interested in the technological side, can I not?

Good thing the internet currency is so safe on the internet.

My chequebook was stolen a couple of years back. When I told the bank, they locked the account. 
And then they made a new account, transferred everything, gave me new cards, and everything was fine. 
This is what banks are supposed to do.

I'm not mocking the technology. The technology is... neat, I guess. It's hardly revolutionary, but I can invision it being quite useful at small scales. 
I do, however, mock the zealotry and unearned superiority here, that's all.

I see the usefulness (and sure, novelty to an extent). But there are many things that are useful at small scales, but can never work at large scales (the scales that this community wants it to).
But again, I'm not close minded, its entirely possibly I'm missing something.

I don't believe that is the case (mocks bitcoin itself). While I'm sure there are those that do, most of them mock the zealotry of the most vocal (which, as it happens, is here). 
As for inefficiency, this is where my understanding may be incorrect, so please clarify: The only way for the network to keep working, to keep processing transactions, is for miners to keep mining? Which obviously has a large cost overhead (as well as initial investment). I fully admit that I am not super knowledgable about this.
If miners have to mine to process transactions, does that mean that 100x 100 bit transactions and 100x 300 Bitcoin transactions have the same "proof of work" cost?

I understand the purpose, but it doesn't answer the scaleability and efficiency question.

I suppose developers are used to being paid in pennies.

Torrents are terrifically efficient. If some sort of torrent based currency was possible that didn't require an exponentially growing database to be passed around then I would be onboard. 
Also, try not to be a dick.

Yeah, make it even more of a chore then it is already, that'll help!

Social Engineering is probably the most reliable way gaining information like this.
