It's keeping me entertained. Got bored playing Vanilla WoW on Private Servers.

You cannot sell it while you are waiting for arrival. What you can do is HODL and then stop into a Lambo store in a few years.

Let them sell. Less people in line at my local Lambo store in the future..

For me it went to 6200 a week or so ago I think, I said no. It dipped to 5500, I said no. Went as low as 5200 and got to nervous. Sat around 5600 for a few days and bought 1 BTC. Now I already have my deposit for a trip to Mars! Haha 8)

I bought at 5600 a few weeks back. Loving that we are back over  7500. Lambos for everyone!

I'm a little over 1 myself. Gonna HODL til we land on Mars! 8)

I also bought my first complete 1.0 of BTC tonight. The rush from hitting Confirm on Coinbase was intense.. Haha.

I had my Nano S a week before Coinbase and my bank finalized everything. So I had time to set my codes etc. Had a go at it last night, pretty straight forward with using the chrome app. I sent a very small amount first to test it which I am glad I did. Very easy to use!

Unfortunately it was like $84 bucks. =/

Congrats! I just bought my first full coin yesterday. I plan to just HODL.
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:31:50
I picked up 1 BTC with everyone selling. I'm taking mine to Mars with me haha.  8)
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:15:04
Nope. Ive verified my ID etc way before. It wont let me pay in CC at all :(
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:36:31
Were you having any issues with using your CC? Every time I go to purchase it says I can only spend up to $1,250 even though I was at like $200, haha.

I started on Coinbase. Did my research and starting buying in. Picked up a Hardware wallet -&gt; Ledger Nano S. Spent over $1,000 so far and I feel like I have a good handle on how things work with transferring etc.
