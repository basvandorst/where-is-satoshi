That’s pretty messed up, doesn’t that violate some form of client rights? 
Prohibiting them to use their own money to buy whatever they want... 
I mean that must be crossing some kind of line, they aren’t even trying to block something that could be classified as “illegal” so their reasoning is extremely superficial.

Debit Card is also mentioned so it is your money

So basically take your money and move to another bank

This still falls under the category of depositing and giving you access to your funds

If you were to bring down the bank cartels, the best way to do it would be to introduce a better alternative.
Fin-tech companies coming will soon patch that void and hopefully all banks will cease to exist. I'd give it 10 to 15 years. It's only 2 actual things that banks do for individuals:
1. Deposit &amp; access funds 
2. Loans &amp; alternative financing 
With blockchain &amp; all forms of crowdfunding (donation, equity, invoice financing) alternatives coming up... you see where I'm going with this...
In the future, the "Bank Era" will be looked upon as the dark ages.

This isn’t unique to banks

By "Close your account" - what exactly happens? they just give you back your money and say we don't want you as a customer??
and as a follow up, where do they send your money when they close your account?,
It sounds so ridiculous it's hard to process...

I get what you are saying, but a debit card is just a way to access your own money. That's like locking someone's stuff in a room and saying "we aren't stopping you from accessing your stuff, but you can't use this door. " - "Maybe climbing through the window or something"

It doesn't matter how much control they have, you can't stop technology, at best you can postpone it. Sooner or later the Bank vs Fintech war is going to be like Libraries Vs The internet. 
It's just about creating something that can do the banks job a lot better. Plus more and more people are already getting disillusioned about banks right now, it's just a matter of time.

Again, not unique to banks

ok, what would be the second door then?
