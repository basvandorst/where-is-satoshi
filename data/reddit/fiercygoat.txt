No, i wanted you to see the big picture. You are too close minded:)

So, Bitcoin will ultimately morphed into a Satoshi, because its value will be so high that would be impractical to use.

Move out from the country. Simple as that. Go live in Mexico like a King.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:05:06
Yeah, bankruptcy sounds like a legit option.

Isn't the interviewer the rapist guy?
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:56:00
So true...
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:12:15
Dude you said, you are considering suicide. So, much better getting killed by the Mexico's drug lords than getting killed by Spain's insane taxes. And there are certain places in Mexico where crime rates are not that bad(e.x Cancun), just got to play it low key so you don't raise any suspicions of your bitcoin wealth.

Is that the only reason why you traveled to Japan? To get your Bitcoins multiplied:) Let me know if it works for you. If it does, I will be heading to Japan pronto!
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:57:14
lol, that was a good one.
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:39:47
I will use common logic here. The more people are born everyday the higher the chances that someday a percentage of them will get into crypto-currencies. That means the demand increases(because of an increasing population) while the supply of bitcoins remains stable. 
And yes, in a sense, the more people the less money. Have you not heard about inflation?

@_date: 2019-05-21 12:20:12
Ok, now lets move on to the map of Asia...
@_date: 2019-05-23 11:19:54
Well, that escalated quickly
@_date: 2019-05-17 23:02:43
This is so true
@_date: 2019-05-14 04:39:14

@_date: 2019-05-26 22:04:54
