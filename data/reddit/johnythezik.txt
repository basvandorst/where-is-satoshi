Very relevant to the discussion on this subreddit! :^)

Even though your point has very little to do with what I said, you're still saying it's backed by the government, not sure if you realize that.
@_date: 2018-06-30 03:33:16
I don't understand what's your point. Currency is backed by the government - simple as that. It draws its value from the government's promise to uphold its status as being legal tender, in other words, it's backed by the law of said country. If e.g. USD wasn't backed by anything (incl. the government), then no merchants would have any obligation to accept that legal tender as a payment for debts. Which is the basic function of money.

Not really. There are sectors where you'd end up with a monopoly simply because of a first mover advantage. And that's one problem only.
@_date: 2019-08-05 21:25:03
Nope, that's a myth. Especially when you're arguing for a completely unregulated market. 
There are markets/industries where the first mover advantage is so strong (usually with a limited supply, such as your example - roads) that a monopoly would arise fairly quickly. But given that you think a taxation is a theft, i'll see myself out.

Forgot people on this subreddit like bullshit promises, my bad :^)

It's called fiat because it has no intrinsic value in itself and is just established as money by the government of said country. That does in no way mean it's backed by nothing at all.
@_date: 2018-06-30 11:15:37
Ok, good for you, but it still has nothing to do with what was said. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 02:33:31
It baffles me how people come up with this stuff. If I were you, I'd buy now and then wait till 2025 when 1 BTC will be over 4M USD!


Don't use them.
@_date: 2018-06-30 03:44:17
Huh? Did you read anything I wrote? Government isn't backed by a currency, that doesn't even make any sense. That doesn't mean anything. Fiat currency has value because the government maintains its value. A =&gt; B. This does not imply B =&gt; A.
You go to a restaurant, you eat a food and then you need to pay for it. The waiter has to accept your bills because of the law. I.e. it's backed by the government. Now sure, you can twist it around but I certainly don't want to argue with someone who just says "no" because.. why not.

Past trends don't predict the future. The fundamental of any investing.
@_date: 2018-06-30 02:59:13
Not sure if you realize that but you're contradicting yourself with "people want MORE" and "deflation is good".
But obviously neither the theories nor real life examples (e.g. Japan, Greece, Spain) are good for you so keep it up with your take on economics!
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:55:25
And as we all know the basic investment fallacy - past trends aren't indication of a future performance. 
I'm not saying it won't go up but it'd be very unreasonable to compare crashes like that. These huge swings can very easily undermine the trust of the "investors".

Even though you're right iCloud hasn't been hacked per se, all the methods used for getting to the account e.g. social engineering, cracking the password via bruteforce or falling a victim to phishing, still greatly affect the trust in the security aspect of bitcoin/icloud/...
@_date: 2019-09-25 23:34:52
Its value is still zero, you're just willing to pay for it. 
Just look at your own case, if no one wants a bitcoin, you could get it for free but you decided to spend more. That just makes your actions illogical.
@_date: 2018-04-12 17:01:08
Why would you not short if you believe btc was overvalued in the first place? Not many people usually short for long term because it has its obvious downsides and it's not always possible. 
Why is crypto so volatile if the adoption will only continue to increase? Yep, that's right, because it's not only correlated to adoption and traders are mostly working with expectations, not utility. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 01:08:30
Hindsight investing is always the best, many people expect bitcoin to drop even more and there's nothing unreasonable about that expectation. 
I don't understand your last paragraph about buyback. It's not a poker term and it's perfectly fine here, describes the issue of shorting very well.
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:14:29
Yeah, you don't really know that. And the value of money doesn't really fluctuate that much that you'd buy a lot less a year from now.
@_date: 2018-04-10 11:52:19
We all do.
@_date: 2018-04-13 01:24:04
Just like people were investing at 19k USD thinking it would go up to 100k. Majority of people investing into cryptos are just regular people without much experience in trading. But yeah, shorting is risky on its own, especially shorting such a volatile thing.
