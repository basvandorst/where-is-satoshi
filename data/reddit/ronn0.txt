Somebody should find one more 0day in BU and crash them all again and this time for real

They didn't have other leaks. Some dnc material was published on dcleaks.com, but wikileaks didn't receive rnc leaks. There is no proof that they did
@_date: 2017-04-24 15:50:47
And there are other node types avilable that are not BU
@_date: 2017-04-30 10:21:39
Why? 
@_date: 2017-04-24 15:49:02
But BU hates SegWit and is anti bitcoin. Also BU is company, but core is programmed/reviewed by voluntary developers and community.
@_date: 2017-04-11 13:05:46
Yeah but we mustn't spam blockchain...
@_date: 2017-04-24 15:18:37
What will happen with ASICBOOST then?
@_date: 2017-04-06 18:51:07
It's like @_date: 2017-04-24 15:05:40
Why are you running a BU node?
@_date: 2017-04-16 13:46:05
Actually you can track bitcoin and bitcoin WILL get tracked. If it goes mainstream it won't be anonymous.
@_date: 2017-04-27 20:22:08
If you have programmer knowledge, then when you hear about bugs like this, create explotit, download TAILS and GO! GO! GO!

What Russian data? What attention whore? Why do you hate wikileaks? For what? They do what no-one else does - publish what should be published. They give protections and anonymity for whisleblowers. Only because of WL we know so much about corruption, government crimes and other things that are kept secret
@_date: 2017-05-19 16:09:56
Fuck you. Shill? This person has published more secrets, corruption, emails than anybody else, ever. And for that he sits in prison embassy for rest of his life.
And then some idiots on reddit tells how bad he is, what attention whore etc 
@_date: 2017-05-13 04:43:35
No they dont. Gov said wl is not working with russia, but source of dnc emails is russia and wl may and may not know that
@_date: 2017-05-07 18:41:47
I think EU shouldn't control Europe. Why people are supporting it? Don't you see all this islamization now, terrorism, rape... this will only get worse. Europe shouldn't become Africa. While U.S is arming terrorists and destabilising middle east, so they have to escape to Europe

JA provided proof of life, read blockchain's latest block and appeared in many inteviews. Has been visited by Tim Pool, Pamela Anderson, Nigel Farage. Has answered to all questions in his live AMA at twitch. And some people still believe he isn't alive. You are 10x more crasy than people at r/politics

Okay. According to (most) liberal logic:
1) Trump is Russian spy - however no proof. There is more proof about pizzagate and spirit cooking. And his team are actual Israel spies - the real problem.
2) Assange is Russian spy (because he published information that you don't want to know and you don't want others to know and Hillary said so) - basically just rumours and "Hillary said so so it must be true, cnn said so too". If you knew anything about WL or would have had followed what they publish and tweet you would understand everything.
Okay but now... Russian Trump Team want to destroy Russian WikiLeaks. Russian CIA director will do everything to get this man in jail. And russian spy donald trump doesn't care if russian spy assange gets arrested.
Good logic   
@_date: 2017-05-01 17:53:06
Maybe...lol but that's still rare
@_date: 2017-05-07 18:31:04
NATO not EU. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 20:31:11
You know nothing about wikileaks. Leaks are very rare. They get only few big leaks per year. Now you see how msm has brainwashed you?
I suggest you to watch his AMA video(on reddit twich). He honestly answered about everything
Also check out 
@_date: 2017-05-19 20:32:13
Also we have to remember Anonymous. They were legion back then
@_date: 2017-05-19 21:13:03
Wow that's an interesting idea. 
Actually that's how wikileaks survives. If they didn't have best cryptographs  they wouldn't survive with all those government millions spent on spying on them
@_date: 2017-05-08 02:39:02
I don't know why so large country like Britain needs EU. But primary reason why EU shouldn't exist anymore is refugees. EU shouldn't become africa.
@_date: 2017-05-19 11:47:08
However UK still wants to arrest him
@_date: 2017-05-07 17:19:51
I'm european too. But do you see what EU is doing?
@_date: 2017-05-01 07:41:47
No, i'm joking. Everybody is. But don't watch CNN - it's propaganda if you haven't figured out yet.
@_date: 2017-05-07 17:20:41
Well i think real nationalist will be less corrupt. If person really want some change, then this person won't be so corrupt.
@_date: 2017-05-07 15:46:25
Russian narrative is created to stop more retarded people from supporting le pen. Actual reason why MSM hates her is because she can destroy EU and euro.
@_date: 2017-05-13 04:45:06
They don't. Retards keep saying this nonsense without any proof
@_date: 2017-05-07 18:32:14
No. Lepen doesn't want war. She even said she wants to leave NATO and make French army and not join wars
@_date: 2017-05-08 02:40:06
It depends on who is president.
@_date: 2017-05-19 21:25:32
Manipuled election?
Its not manipulation. Clinton was the one that manipulated elections. Assange is a publisher. He did what he should have.
How don't you understand it?
@_date: 2017-05-01 07:20:24
Well but it actually is so.
/pol/ LARPs are still more credible than CNN experts.
/pol/ facts are still less fake than CNN
In /pol/ there is freedom of speech. /pol/ doesn't cut live stream feed if some person say something that doesn't go with propoganda. 
/pol/ is better intel agency than CIA, NSA. They found one ISIS base and Russian army destroyed it. It means that /pol/ has killed some ISIS, while CIA has armed thousands of them.
@_date: 2017-05-07 15:44:43
But why do we need globalism? One bigger government that controls most european countries. And then EU decides to take all migrants, MSM propogandises how good it is. All politicans are corrupt. Fuck EU.
