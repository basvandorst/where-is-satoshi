what about using SI units and going with the nice and clear µBits ?

a non probablistic view of most crypto things and especially consensus systems is not useful. someone might guess your private key and steal all your coins - is it probable? no!
its similar with doublespends, a doublespend will only succeed with a chance that is at most as high as the ratio of miners that allow it to the ones that don't, which by my guess is vanishingly small.
 but yeah, if you want to steal a cup of coffee from starbucks with a 0.01% chance, go ahead...

node policy is what makes bitcoin, bitcoin.
that such a thing is possible is not the question, the question is if its probable, since the default setting is to not allow it i'd wager its not.

i think the real question here is if there are any mempools or other big hashrate players actually strictly use the transaction with the higher fee rather than the one they saw first.
 i would wager that most would probably prefer staying on the default policy of not helping double spenders even if they profit from it in the short term because of the potential for negative publicity in the long term.
 do you happen to have data showing that that is not the case?

sounds strange, how would they know about the kind of darknet sites running on their users vps?

kinda makes me uneasy if they do this somewhat routinely to deanonymize tor usage...
@_date: 2016-09-04 05:35:48
hmm, thats new, my vps with them is still running fine. (and literally everything besides the bitcoin i sent them is fake)

Small reverse engineering jobs on the weekends. HMU if you need to find out how a program does something or how to make it do something :)

rofl, "social media"...
 its like they are gauging the potential for/scale of negative public reaction they could expect from stealing his coins.

yeah, except bitcoin isn't an "app"... (and using that abstraction makes you seem like you were born yesterday)
low blocksizes allow everyone to run the full core, those are the end users who require a pleasant experience. everyone else can just use no/low-fee 3rd party derivative solutions.

a 1 bit error is not irrecoverable by any means... you can just try flipping all the bits one by one and see what makes the keys valid.

shapeshift.io to monero to xmr.to to bitcoin.

as cynical as that sounds i think it'd actually benefit bitcoin by making it clear to the last person that it is to be taken seriously...

400$ ? more like 100$...
 and this will have lost you like a potential 100$ before long into the new year...
