I see what you did there.
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:07:23
Oh my goodness!
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:35:36
Haaaa! Maybe I gotta do an AMA!
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:52:27
Well did you have fun?
@_date: 2019-06-21 12:10:31
Thank you! MagicNoodle!
@_date: 2019-06-28 21:07:31
Something about the increased transaction costs. Sorry.
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:27:41
Especially enjoying the conversation today!

My problem is more that I want to buy more. I decided on an amount I would invest and I'm trying so hard to stay close to that number. When it goes down  I consider it on sale and I hate to miss a sale!

Good one!

I wish to throw my hat in the ring.
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:23:50
Am I really the only chick here?
@_date: 2019-06-28 21:41:38
Very :)

I just sold some bitcoin. So you can be sure it will go up up up. You're welcome.
@_date: 2019-12-25 04:25:05
Merry Christmas, fellow cryptocurrency enthusiasts!
@_date: 2019-05-20 11:56:05
Same feelings here, but I've only been investing a week.
@_date: 2019-05-31 21:19:16
B B B Bitcoin, you just ain't seen n n nothing yet.

I only have it on my computer by the time it turned on it went up to 72. Oh well.  Still pretty good.
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:09:07
I've been investing in bitcoin for 3 days. So much fun and so much to learn.
@_date: 2019-05-28 20:34:53
Heck yeah!
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:11:21
Can you do that in Coinbase? (I'm very new.)
@_date: 2019-05-28 19:17:48
I admit I am very new and I don't know all the nuances. But it always seems like these articles say, if it goes up that's a sign it's going to go up and if it goes down that's a sign it's going to go down. I think we can all get a job writing these predictions. Lol!
