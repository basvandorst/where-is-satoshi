I agree the 21 million cap is ideal to keep around if possible.  But there could be another possibility which I just [commented on]( in another thread where increasing the cap actually does not devalue all the bitcoins in existence.

I hope you are right, but I can forsee another possibility.  As the mining reward starts to run out, we don't know how the network will react.  Miners are supposed to only survive on fees.  Is this going to be enough to support the network? Who knows.  Maybe it won't work as well when the mining becomes less profitable, fees may climb to huge amounts.  Right now we have a big inflation subsidy keeping fees low.  What if the fees get so large that people start hating Bitcoin because its so expensive to transfer value?  They will abandon it for other coins.  Then Bitcoiners would actually not lose money by increasing the cap.  Increasing the cap may lead to lower fees and more confidence in the network and an increase in the price of Bitcoin.  In this way consensus could even be reached to have a 1 BTC static block reward for example.  Just some food for thought.  I hope that the 21 million cap will hold, but we can't forsee the future yet.  Interested in others thoughts on this as well.

Yes they have: 
Many undercover cops will try to buy from you and casually mention they are using it for something illegal like drugs or credit card fraud.  Then you get busted.  Some are even being charged for not having a money transmitter license.  Its bullshit, but what do you expect in Land of the Coward and Home of the Slave.

Don't know why you downvote.  At least comment on why you think its nothing to worry about.  Should we just put our fingers in our ears and close our eyes and try not to look at reality and avoid looking at possible risks or future issues?

Don't know if this is legit but heard of it long time ago:

He was talking about the risks and possibilities of it.  He said he is against lifting the block reward and hes an Austrian sound money guy.  But people here do not want to look at reality or discuss anything, they just want to yell at anyone trying to speak about risks and future possibilities.

Although the credit card setup and large amount of 30,000 dollars was what they used on him, they also charged him for operating without a money transmitter license which would have nothing to do with the illegal credit carding.  I believe the Bitcoin Foundation also did some lawyer stuff, (I think amicus brief?) because it would set a bad precedent for Bitcoiners.
