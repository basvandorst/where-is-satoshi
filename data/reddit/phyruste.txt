I feel like this is a time travel account that has done this and now uses this to transmit messages to the past. How was the coma? And did it pay off where your at now in the timeline?
@_date: 2018-05-24 18:29:20
How do I induce this coma? and how do I migrate to a country with free healthcare? Cause if I did this in the states the health bill alone will probably suck up all my profits after I wake up.

At least on the birghtside, they will be sending all their incoming new users right to the crypto subreddits, if they keep this up were then being promoted more than the defaults now now that defaults arn't a thing. Might give these subs the shot to outgrow the rest and take over the reddit hive mind. Bitcoin on the front page all day possibilities thanks to this.

It's a bitcoin donation bot, should send you a message so you can collect.

That's why I wan't to get not just fuck you money, but help you money like bill has, that way my kids can help those less fortunate, I intend to start a bunch of foundations too to help people over the boarder get over here to find better work and escape war zones. So much of my family that didn't make it over during the migration like my parents were able too do; I see living in poverty over there, I also intend to start programing schools there in hopes that a lot won't need to migrate. All in hopes that they will be able to use those skills to drive money there and overtake the cartels wealth influence that has control of the areas. It's a long shot but with time I see it being possible. Get the youth to a better life in the tech game than the drug game that consumes the area. It's also another reason I don't wan't kids though, I feel they would be a huge distraction and time consumption from these projects. Does this make us selfish putting our own dreams over the dreams of our kids that could be?

They should allow us to donate crypto through them then if their going to use it to advertise themselves.

I never lived the having just enough, I wen't from not being able to buy even gas to get to work leading to me having to run to work, to having more than I even realized. But I see what your saying, although as soon as I started making this money I started helping family by taking over the bills allowing them to pay off debt and balance out their expenses. I also have a good chunk of coin set aside for them when the miltimillion dollar bicoin day comes so when I retire they can retire with me, as well as enough to be able to support their kids should my siblings wish to have some, and most importantly to give my parents the life they deserve. I'm also afraid to commit to any girl at the time because of fear of distraction from my family(my last ex really did a number on me stealing 10k and a shitlout of my attention, but the biggest part was the 10k that could have bought me 50 bitcoins at the time)

It also causes all the whales to sell bringing the tree just low enough for me to collect more of the apples until the real whales of the world come in. We need the Warren Buffets of the world to feel comfortable enough to come in, because they have the investment mindset we need, the one we all preach, the hodl mindset, the pretend you already lost it mindset so you can surprise yourself in 10 to 20 years when your ready to retire.

Shit, I don't wan't to be an executioner man, how about you do that part and I'll do yours? I'll let you have 10,000 of my btc's if your willing to trade?

It's hard to say, depends on the mentality of the people. Because bitcoins value is not directly tied to it's money backing, more peoples perceptions. So when the time comes that the currencies start dying like the venezuelan dollar it will be on the peoples mindset that keeps bitcoins detatched from that or attatched to it. It's all on the shoulders of the marketers at the time when that happens, they can stear the public perseption ship to sink with the fiat currencies, or sail over it and take peoples trust as the new medium of exchange in the world while the titanics of currencies past sink to the bottom of the sea of history alongside with the rest of the dead worlds past currencies.
