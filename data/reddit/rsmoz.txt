The fingerprints may be all over your phone, but it's not trivial to make a physical model that the phone would accept as valid. Furthermore, it really would be much easier to just break into the device's private keys if a passcode can unlock them.
@_date: 2014-07-10 01:20:39
Yea, I'm working on a wallet app written in Swift that just calls code in CoreBitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-09 22:05:42
Yes, but that's much harder to do when extracting the prints off of a surface. It's decently easy to do if you have the person's finger there as a reference. But again, hard to do off prints that are just on the device itself. 
And a 4-digit passcode is trivial to break.

iOS devices constantly maintain a connection with Apple for push notifications. Sending pushes, which is how I update the app, does not use any additional power.

There is no popup if the URL is simply opened Here's how it works: If the URL is opened (e.g. tapped on somewhere, entered into safari), it is totally arbitrary.
However, with iOS 8 extensions, apps can declare that they support a type of URL, like bitcoin://
When an app wants to show all available action extensions that handle a certain type of link, it can - rather than opening a URL - have iOS display all apps that claim to support a URL type. ***That*** is when an app can choose to show a popup that shows all apps that handle a certain link type.
Would anybody be interested in my bitcoin wallet app that *would* work from a link within Safari?

There's a study that shows that doing this for a month makes people a lot happier. I've done it myself for the last week and have already noticed positive changes in how I think. 
I want other people to do this, too. It's good for society.
I thought it would be neat to have this sort of societal change occur through a mechanism common in the Bitcoin world: Incentives.
I want more people to do this, and I was also curious about the positive social implications, so I posted here. That's it.
Edit: Here's some more info: 
There are many variants to this.

If you're really paranoid, you could avoid this possibility by creating your own seed using diceware, using a disposable non-internet-connected computer (you'd need local software for this, which isn't available quite yet) to "restore" your Trezor to a seed of your choosing. You'd then need to destroy the computer, or the hard drive at the very least. Then the only possible vulnerabilities would require physical access, which would be impossible to do for a mass attack.

Yes, you plug it into the iTunes *application*. This is vastly different from being forced to sign up for an iTunes account. You are just asked to plug it into your computer.
If you meant that you didn't like being forced to use a computer with your iPod, that is no longer the case for iOS devices, such as the touch. With other iPods, you still must do that. I don't see why that's an issue considering they don't have WiFi and you can't put music on them otherwise.
I think you must have misunderstood Apple's instructions. Clearly Apple needs to make things simpler to avoid further customer confusion.

Who cares what Apple does to restrict the App Store? You aren't forced to use it. Apple puts a fantastic HTML5 browser on the iPhone that allows you to access a whole world of web apps. The App store is certainly an option though, and you can't be mad at a company for providing a better alternative to web applications and building it how they like.
But if all you care about is how "free" an app ecosystem is, just use webapps.

My app does something unique: It actually shows the current exchange rate on the icon. It updates every 60 seconds. You can always see the latest exchange rate from your homescreen.

@_date: 2013-03-29 05:42:46
I think we're all overestimating the relative power, intelligence, and knowledge of the average App reviewer. Apple has to hire these guys by the hundreds to approve apps quickly. It's not like they have executives directly banning the bitcoin wallet apps because they threaten their bottom line. It's some guy reading a protocol and rejecting the apps. 
They actually DO allow apps that send and receive money from accounts. They allow the PayPal app and they don't take a cut of those transactions. The reason that the Bitcoin wallet apps aren't allowed isn't due to Apple's corporate strategy being anti-Bitcoin, it's just that some average people working as reviewers misinterpreted the policies and protocols set up by Apple. There simply aren't enough great people to hire to review the thousands of App store apps and updates streaming in all the time.
