FDA gives that to many new drugs. ITs common practice along with fast track designation which does shit other than increase PPS for a short period of time. Its good to see that this is working on treatment resistant applications. As stated before I do want to follow this.

This is excellent news that new (well not really new) drugs are being tried for PTSD. Its not a good thing at all. 
Although I love this effort from the community, a 68% efficacy rate wont get FDA approval. Usually PH2 is make or break for a major drug. I don't know what they can really do to Increase this unless they get lucky picking a specific group that reacted more positive to the treatment (ex 18-25 yr old female post pregnancy, or male 30-40yr old ect...). FDA will be looking for this in their PH3 Results but it will be a long term study (at least 2 years, probably more for long term side effects noted). 
I hope all works out with this. I will track this in my biotech research. I would be glad to donate if their CEO came out with a proper road map for the public.

Coinbase says $0 ACH transfer fee from bank but 1.69% fee to transfer too bank account. 
I am buying one BTC here soon with my credit union so I will see what they stiff me with. My CU is pretty good on fees though, not many unless you overdraft or miss payments. 
@_date: 2017-02-22 03:32:53
I always set my fee to max and never had an issue. 
@_date: 2017-02-20 19:45:57
This etf isn't designed to accumulate Bitcoin rather trade at the market rate change if BTC. 
They will be required to hold a certain amount to cover assets for SEC purposes to show the fund has a legitimate purpose and liquidity. 
Aka price of BTC goes up and fund goes up. BTC drops and fund drops. 
@_date: 2017-02-11 03:35:11
So because hackers have been able to exploit poorly secured and managed exchanges or holding companies, that means bitcoin is dead? That should like saying because robbers robbed banks that banks are dead.

What the fuck man. It sounds like just tossing money in the toilet and flushing type of game.

@_date: 2017-02-20 19:39:59
Step one - buy lots of bitcoin when it starts
Step two - hold coins for a while and promote the currency
Step three - after gaining coverage from big hedge funds and the public, start a fund for the coins you own
Step four - sell all your coins for 10,000% increase in value
Step five - watch price crash
Step Six - repeat 1-5

Coinbase has about a $20 price difference when selling. Strange how it shows 2 prices but always buys the highest price and sells the lowest price 
@_date: 2017-02-11 03:47:44
This etf will bring more investor eyes to bitcoin. Lots of people don't want the hassle of setting up a wallet and funding it and buying coins and tracking and selling. 
They just want to buy $1000 or $5000 in a etf and let it sit. 
I hope to get my coins before it lists on an exchange. I believe this could double btc price if there is a lot of interest in the etf. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 16:14:41
I can't even buy today with coinbase. Not sure what's up but there's a 3D security outage prompt on their home page.

Makes total sense doesn't it! 
@_date: 2017-03-15 01:10:04
What I have learned the last month is:
A majority of people in and have little to no understanding of how markets and business work with currency. They see bitcoin as an opportunity to make money and or transfer wealth between individuals. That is not what bitcoin was created for nor should ever be for. An ETF will only exemplify the votality of the currency by allowing people to profit even more off of it. 
ETH was created as a software source to make things work faster or better but is now being exploited to be used for profit making. 
People need to stick to the roots of BTC and what it was developed for or it will ultimately fail. Attacks on developers and their software will not help the currency but only aid in its downfall. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 03:34:14
Yes this looks like someone is trying to artificially increase demand to increase price. 
That's all bitcoin values is based off of. Supply and demand.

@_date: 2017-03-11 00:55:25
I don't believe this is the end for bitcoin. I think it's a major setback for acknowledgement from the world. 
Either way BTC will drop for a while until we get some good news from the etf or less regulation from china.

@_date: 2017-03-09 19:36:22
Currency, no matter the type (gold , bitcoin, euros, yen, dollars) should have the freedom to be used for purchase of any goods anywhere in the world. If you are limited to what the currency can be used for, it limits the user base of said currency. 
Saying that bitcoin should only be used for large purchases so it can be fee'd accordingly, it nothing but regulation and goes against the core principals of bitcoin as a currency of trade. 
What you are suggesting is that bitcoin should be used as a hedge like gold, against other currency's downfall because it's worth so much now. Like gold, bitcoin is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:54:42

Banks own the money you used to buy your bitcoins. 
Banks still own you unless you pay all your bills with BTC and make all your daily transactions in the currency. 
@_date: 2017-01-18 04:59:09
I don't own any bitcoin. I don't trade any bitcoin. But advertisements like this make me understand why I don't involve myself with it. I can't trust my fortune based off of hype and the media. 
That being said, I don't believe bitcoin is going away any time soon. Maybe I'll buy a coin just for "diversification" purposes like those silver bars.

No. Coinbase only has crypto wallets. You can’t hold fiat in a wallet. 
Gdax however does have fiat wallets and is owned by  Coinbase but it’s an exchange. IMO Coinbase is an exchange because you don’t own the keys.
