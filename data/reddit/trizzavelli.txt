Lol bro its a joke look at the numbers this was a test trade I wasn’t sure about the movement, so i put down like a couple dollars and it ended up being a good trade. Im also sure i wouldn’t let reddit decide my financial gains/losses

Those atm machines are a scam I don’t know were u are but i payed a 15% fee in the UK tried to cancel it... never again, i guess its KYC or nothing, its the only way if ur not willing to wait like me.
