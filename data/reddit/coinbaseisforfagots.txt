yeah bruh, a drives license is a form of ID.  Banks will accept that shit yo.
If you are asking questions like that here you may want to take it easy on the bars.  Never get high on your own supply.

To be fair, noobs suck at bitcoin so they would fall under my previous statment.
Coinbase goes down all the time, why rely on them at all.  Their customer service is comcast or pop copys level shittyness.   
Bitcoin was built so you could be your own bank, why let a company hold your funds when you dont have to?  Why accept that risk when its so easy to secure your own funds with a paper wallet or trezor or ledger or electrum on an encrypted tails drive.
coinbase is for fagots

wow, you must suck at bitcoin and securing your shit if the only thing preventing you from being hacked is coinbase.

I'm a long term holder as well, im not buying to day trade either.  It's not so much about the price as it is the principal of it.  Why would coinbase cancel an order without alerting the customer?  They never cancel my orders when the price goes down, which is interesting to say the least!  Any way you cut it, it is just bad business practices, and other exchanged don't treat you nearly as shitty so i dont understand why people stick with coinbase.


I disagree, how is coinbase any easier than say gemini?  The easiest method of buying bitcoins is probably a cash deposit at a local bitcoin sellers bank.  That is instant, you don't need to submit a scan of your rectum to get approved, and you wont get your order reversed or account canceled for no reason.

This kind of feels like a strawman.  I didn't say to use airgapped whonix or run a self hosted anything, but you chose to simplify misrepresent my argument in that manner.
If you dont know what you are doing, get a trezor or ledger to store bitcoins.  Or store them on a paper wallet or tails electrum wallet, i mean come on that's free and easy for anyone!
Coinbase treating their customers like shit isn't good for widespread adoption either.  Threads pop up all the time, "help i cant get my coins out of coinbase vault and support is worthless and wont reply to my 50 inquires about the problem over the last 2 months."

People are recommending coinbase so they can make a quick buck off a referral for you.  Coinbase is the worst bitcoin company out there, just look at all the frustrated customers with unanswered problems on their subreddit, Bitcoins on coinbase are really expensive compared to on other exchanges.  Get registered on kraken or gemini if you are looking to use an exchange.  Or use local bitcoins to buy bitcoins with cash.

I purchased bitcoin on coinbase for a while without issue too.  Then the price swung up big after i had placed a buy at a lower price on coinbase.  Coinbase canceled my order out of no where.  I had enough in my bank account to cover the bitcoin purchase 10x over.  My account had been verified in every way possible.  I gave them everything they asked for up to a blood or semen sample and they still hassled me and canceled my order.  Fuck coinbase.

Then get your your purchases reversed and your account shut down without warning.  Then message support and find out Coinbase support doesn't give a shit about you or your problems!
