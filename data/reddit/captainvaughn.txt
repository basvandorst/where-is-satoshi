I started coinbase a few weeks ago. If you only care about buying and selling quickly without needing to read a whole lot of fine print, it's a good place to start. But you're limited to 200$ a week to buy. I did have issues verifying my bank acc because even though I entered the correct amounts, they insisted it was incorrect. On the second try it worked and has been running smoothly ever since

Why is this not top comment

That’s really cool. I see an evil AI robot inventing the concept of bitcoin so people will “mine” it. Little do they know the miners are actually making the AI stronger to overtake mankind

Honestly the first 3 will find themselves all being involved somehow. At least for a 5 year time frame, cash-backed cryptocurrency via your smartphone seems like the first logical steps

I gotchyu fam: 
1. TURN UP THE POWER
2. Play that bitcoin billionaire song on repeat in the background 24/7
3. Trade in your BTC for Bitconnect Coin. It’s a buy rn and it’s going to MOON soon!!
4. Put ice cubes in the coolant reservoir to improve thermals
5. Use SOLAR FREAKIN’ ROADWAYS to power the mining rig

How much is this bad boy making you?
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:48:13
Sweet! Also if you don’t “mine” me asking, is this just a joint effort of you and a few partners or are you working for someone?

It's coinbase, I just use it because it has a pretty slick price alert feature. Comes in really handy when I'm away from the desktop

Still too many panic sellers. We’ve got till at least high 6k’s until things equalize

So something like a 1070 mining rig is more efficient than 14 office PCs? Keep in mind the office PCs aren’t coming me anything to run. By all means of you are sure these PCs are justing going to be wasting power I want to know, but if they have any kind of potential I want to give it a shot

If it makes you feel any better I trie mining bitcoin a when I was 16, I'm 19 now and I remember I mined quite a bit. then I forgot the number to my wallet. Don't know how to get my small amount of bitcoin that I've mined out since I formatted my old computer and that wallet is long gone
@_date: 2017-06-29 06:52:22
I thought I'd get more detailed answers from you folks haha
@_date: 2017-06-28 08:09:26
I don't think he did lmao
@_date: 2017-06-28 07:35:23
He knew about bitcoin but he assumed the market was over saturated since the price for a coin is so high.
One coin was attractive to him because it was "new" and had these "incredible returns"

My dad. 3000$ isn't devastating for him tho. That's probably all his beer money for the year down the drain. I told him to try bitcoin instead. I've been researching it since I was 16, I turned 18 a few months ago and I finally started investing 50$ a month in bitcoins
