Maybe each day there could be a automatic set-up telling how much you would be willing to spend that day. It would then create a private key with that amount of bitcoin, so if you do get hacked that's all you would loose. If you were away from your computer for over a day you could set up longer lasting, less safe private keys (although there would be little chance of being hacked).
