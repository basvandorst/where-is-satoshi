"Pardon Ma'am, but we noticed you have a Bitcoin Accepted Here sticker in your store window.  May we have a word with you in private?"

They have them, they are the core bitcoin devs (i think.. not sure who to believe any more).  But they are few and don't seem to be the ones making out the best from all of this growth, which surprises me.

Businesses who want to accept and use Bitcoin can get used to banks closing their accounts like ants can get used to being set on fire.

Or we had even more coins in Gox, and as it appears those are not coming back, we got the rest of them "hacked" and it's good night sweet prince. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 13:16:20
Yeah they did.  Everything they held before is now worth 15%-20% less.  100,000 (give or take) former hardcore Bitcoin enthusiasts have now suddenly stopped telling their friends and family to get onboard. That's assuming they aren't actively slamming Bitcoin at every opportunity. We aren't anywhere near being done feeling the aftershocks of MtGox and the attitude of 'don't ask questions just believe' that fostered it's existence for so long.

Remember how they said they haven't sold any Bitcoins yet?   Does paying for a space trip count as "selling"?  This bullshit just one of the many tracks on the Bitcoin oligarchy's Pied Piper playlist. Look over here! Shiny!

Do you stand guard at your house all day too? Civilization means being able to trust others not to fuck you in the ass so you have more time and resources to focus on other things.

Nope, just putting this here for future reference. 
Not interested in in hair splitting anecdote arguments about how many times something has to be mentioned to count as "more frequently" vs someone else's definition of "more frequently". 
Commence downvotes and accusations of FUD, understandable because this is not an obvious trend to spot right now. time will tell.

Bitcoin is in fact a single application of the network.  A great one except for one or two showstopping flaws that are easy to ignore or made irrelevant when Bitcoin's price is rising 50%+ a month, but start to pinch again when that rate of rise is no longer sustainable.  
I think the people who already made their fortunes on Bitcoin and have appointed themselves the spokespeople for it are starting to recognize that there is a non trivial chance Bitcoin may be unable to withstand its own size at some point in the near future, and have begun to hedge their unbridled optimism by dropping this curious phrase into conversations and interviews.
@_date: 2014-03-05 12:47:07
Nope, that's enough.  We've had plenty of time to solve the transaction limit issue, and it needed solving 6 months ago. But it's not fixed and the reason for that is that it's not as simple as you make it out, don't kid yourself. If we learn anything from the MtGox debacle it should be to recognize that smoke means fire before we get burned, not after.

I would love to see this link as well.  In fact there were some very knowledgeable people expressing surprise that MtGox had that many Bitcoins, period, let alone losing them. This story is being promoted by the BF because they know that statistically there are about 2/3 more people who didn't use MtGox than who did, and many of those are the angry ITG personality who would gladly join in any crusade to 'kill' all of Bitcoin's demons by association with MtGox.  
Anything, anything to buy the market price back up  (including actually buying it back up) to the level Wall St. considers worthwhile to deal with, so they can cash out and leave to work on the "next experiment" after they pronounce, with a mock frown, that Bitcoin 'has to die so that crypto can live'.
@_date: 2014-03-05 13:18:42
whatever.  like i said, not interested in hairsplitting arguments with true believers.  See you all in a month or two after this phrase, or one broadly similar to it, gains traction.  
@_date: 2014-03-05 08:00:34


I'd like to buy some FailedExperimentCoin right now, because I am sure we will be hearing this phrase a lot more from the people who already made their nut on Bitcoin.  That phrase is going to the moon
@_date: 2014-03-05 03:51:07
Answer to both:  Being able to trust the Bitcoin businesses, the people who run them and the people who promote them not to be actively working to screw you while telling you it's your own damned fault.

Biggest problem is that Bitcoin cannot scale past 7 transactions per second, network-wide.  There is a backlog of transactions that has been building steadily for years, averaging around 400-1000 last summer, and now averaging 2000-4000.  At 7 seconds per transaction that leads to a delay of 5-8 minutes on average, for a single confirmation.  
This number will only get higher from here, and although the transaction cap can be changed in software, doing so would require a hard fork in the client, and this is hard to do because of the cooperation it would require from large-stake parties with dissimilar interests in the outcome. So the limit remains despite being known as an elephant in the room problem for quite a while.  Like Tx Malleability.
edit- thanks for the cakeday props.  I didn't notice I had rolled the trolldometer over once more!

It is not established that the coins are missing.  It is starting to look like the people claiming Karpeles has the coins (not all 850k, but something close to 500k at least) or knows who does, are not as crazy as I thought. Pre-emptively punking Gox has derailed some other plans.
@_date: 2014-03-06 02:55:04
You can't, but you can be sure that the fiat is not being used to purchase more coin independently of the customers' own coin inputs.  I don't have an answer for fiat auditing that doesn't lead to an overhead-encumbered, regulated retail bank-like solution, but if just BTC balances can be proven solvent, untampered with and secured that is more than half the risk eliminated with exchanges.

If you had a chance to peruse those business plan documents from MtGox you would see that they added something like 75% of all their 1,000,000 accounts in the October-December bubble. True, some old schoolers should have known better but amazingly, they were fooled too. However most of that money was new money that came in due to the massive media hype sprung from that one fellow in Sweden who bought a house with a forgotten stash of Bitcoin, a story that could very well have been a PR stunt after seeing this all in hindsight.  
Those people are the ones we have to thank for Bitcoin going from $150 to $1200, and even this afterglow $600-ish price we have now.  Those are the ones who got shafted (assuming they didn't just sell like real speculators, but decided to HODL because they believed in Bitcoin).  
@_date: 2014-03-06 00:22:51
What about an exchange model where the Bitcoin store is provided by a trusted, independent escrow-based "coin tank", and the exchange itself is treated as a client of that tank, providing the trader with just a matching engine clearing services for fiat?
I guess we could go a step further and push out the exchange platform into the wallets themselves (you can set up a separate 'account' in the wallet for trading use), but matching speed will be a problem without some kind of centralization.

ok fine, I was going to wait a month to collect a few more but here's a start.
Eric Voorhees used this phrase in his Bloomberg interview yesterday, citing a "Failed Experiment" ending as one possible outcome for Bitcoin, the other being global adoption or something along those lines.  It's not google-able because as far as I know there is no transcript of that interview, but watch it and you will see.
Several other outlets have recently used the phrase in different forms as well - "failure of this grand experiment" and "stopped being a great experiment", or more obliquely along the lines of  "Bitcoin is great but it might not be the end all solution". Not all of these outlets are hostile to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:52:21
No, you're just wrong.  I can understand you being wrong because spending time around the Bitcoin community fosters a myopic view of how the rest of the world, and newcomers to Bitcoin especially, perceive who the players are and it is already an enormous leap of faith for someone to go from curious outsider to Bitcoin holder.  Once that leap is made, the ability to recognize real danger from normal bumps in the road has already been compromised and takes a while recalibrate to the new environment.  Gox started having real problems before many people had time to make this adjustment. 
Many old school Bitcoiners and people who should otherwise be well acquainted with the kind of characters that inhabit this world also had a lot stored in MtGox, and they lost too. Bitcoin-the-currency is not ready for primetime, and may never be.  Blockchain-powered distributed consensus networks are.

should have waited for the appropriate signal before dropping docs on MtGox.  
In a bid to impress whom he sees as the inheritors of Bitcoin's future (SecondMarket) he cost some key people some money and helped create an uncontrolled mainstream media shitstorm where there was supposed to have been an orderly, insider-led cashiering of Karpeles, followed by a wind down and takeover of MtGox by someone, perhaps BTCChina.
Now he's getting paid back.  I admire his spunk but I think he dun goofed here.
@_date: 2014-03-05 07:22:19
Bitcoin will not break into the mainstream under 'don't trust anyone' circumstances.  If people are OK with Bitcoin being the Gentoo of crypto while some newer competitor developed by people who understand what their mainstream users expect becomes Ubuntu, then I guess this is not an issue. 
There's real money involved every day in my eTrade account, and a population of people in that market who also want to take my money from me, yet I don't realistically have to worry about eTrade vaporising overnight and running off with 6% of the entire stock market.
@_date: 2014-03-06 02:49:31


There will be no mainstream adoption either, if Bitcoin is unsafe to use without jumping through hoops that mainstream payment systems do not require.
