They say they will upgrade on Dec 2.

That's a good point. 
Every day there is a comment saying that BTC or BCH is the next fiat but when actually the value btc-fiat drops or worse, is banned, the same ones are issuing complains. They are plain hypocrites. Just admit you want btc valuation to increase to cash out your fiat lambo otherwise stfu when the price moves down and dont spam us with your moaning.

It's the locker to your wallet.

What return do you expect from your investment? From 25$ if you consider 4x, that's 100$. It is barely a nice date meal in any civilized country. At 25k (if there will be 4x, eg bitcoin at 20k), thats 100k. This is a house in any civilized country.... 25$ is too small, too late. The BTC transaction fees alone are 5$ if u move your founds one way to your private wallet.

If you lock them in the contract, how he will be able to buy the house? The contract is just a "freeze" on the funds.
