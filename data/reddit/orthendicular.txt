Great video, this is exactly what I was looking for.

So far I've read [Bitcoin and Digital Currencies by James Cox]( which has been a really good intro to the history of banking and currency, and has left me hungry for more. But now I can't find anything that gives a laymen, yet in depth, explanation of the matter.

The problem is we don't know how deep this bloodbath will go.

Are you saying not to use Coinbase because that defeats the whole purpose of decentralization? So it's a matter of principle? Or are there actual security reasons for not using Coinbase?

That's a good point.

After watching more of these videos, and while I appreciate the information the man is sharing, it's obviously biased - the dude is the CEO of a company that sells gold and silver, and every video talks about how "history favors those who have the foresight to to buy gold or silver before their national currency completely busts." It's just a very well done marketing series.

Fuck that.

Thanks, great explanation. Currently my coins are stored with Coinbase. Do you recommend switching over completely to Electrum, even though I don't fully understand it or how it works?

A liquid currency should not depend on capital gains for you to regain your purchasing power. That defeats the purpose of eventual stability, which would be needed for mass adoption.
So what then, are we just at the mercy of vendors to offer discounts for Bitcoin transactions? Not every seller will do that. I'm referring to the system here, and not individual decisions each merchant needs to make. The system seems to have a built in setback that would make it difficult for mass adoption.

Most banks offer free checking accounts and absolutely free check cashing. Yes there are ways you can get charged fees, but the most common task of getting your payroll direct deposit in your account, then spending that using a credit/debit card is free.
With Bitcoin, I'd have to convert my payroll to Bitcoin, which would mean 1% lower wages for all that hard work I'd done.

Aren't college textbook publishers the most money hungry of all?

Very interesting. So what about basic changes/bug fixes to the master branch? How quickly are those adopted by the miners?

Right, and if I had the cash and Bitcoins, why would I pay with Bitcoins when it would be wiser to pay with cash?

If the dollar declines relative to its purchasing power, does that not also mean that the purchasing power of a bitcoin goes down as well?
