Let's just ignore the 1.5 years it went down so it looks we're going up. 
Bitcoiners...my god. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 01:28:59
So let me get this right. So far this year we go sideways then after 7 months we go up a few days because of a blatant pump and dump, then we go down again for 7 days and that's called being in an uptrend. And anything else is being downvoted. 
Am i correct?
@_date: 2015-07-17 19:46:35
I wonder why Bitcoiners use this ridiculous logic all the time.
Oh wait, i know why. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 17:11:35
Wow. Are you seriously this desperate? Just wow. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 08:56:36
No. Just no. Get it out of your system. This shit needs to stop. There is no Greece + Bitcoin. It's non-existing. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 21:27:26
No. Just like the 150 other posts that asked the same question about a new product or service. 
Maybe it's time to stop with these titles. The answer is no. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 14:08:25
Why are they wrong?
@_date: 2015-07-20 18:27:47
So booming that it is non existing to the rest of the world outside this sub. 
It's booming to you because you live in this sub. The beanie babies business is booming to those in the beanie babies sub while it doesn't exist to the rest of the world. 
I wonder what you people think the downvote option is for. Here's a hint: to censor people you don't agree with it is not it. That's about as childish as it gets. 
Think about it. You're older than 12, post on a public forum and try to censor everyone you don't agree with while foaming from the mouth. There is something seriously wrong with your life if you act like that. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 21:38:00
I know it was the question in the article. It doesn't change anything to my answer. Stop making things up. It makes you look silly. 
You also downvoted me because you're seeing ghosts. Please apologize and upvote me again. 
Edit: and another downvote from OP. You're not good at this messageboard thing are you? How old are you that you behave this way?
@_date: 2015-07-20 18:52:27
It is common knowledge that these type of companies can offer these "amazing" deals because they are bought with stolen cards. 
But Bitcoiners don't like to talk about that so any mention of it gets downvoted. They simply don't want to know. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 19:55:21
Ok, you don't agree with my point. That happens on public forums. Is that worth 10 downvotes? I don't agree with OP. Do i downvote him? No of course not. That would be ridiculous. 
If i instead would've said "yes bitcoin is booming. Moon soon" would i have had 10 downvotes for lack of substance? Would you/people be complaining about my post? Answer me honestly please. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 19:46:10
Why do you skip the first step? How do you know he's spending?
@_date: 2015-07-20 22:15:24
Awesome. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 19:35:06
And if they would put their saving in Bitcoin it somehow would be safe?
If someone would've bought 100 coins last week they would've lost 4000 dollars by now. You know, at the point where everybody here said Greeks should put their money into Bitcoin. 
Thank god that didn't actually happen. It would've been a disaster. 
The few 100 people that did buy coins already lost (a lot of) money. 
Edit: do the downvoters have anything to say? Feel free to say why exactly you are downvoting me. What part of my post deserves to be downvoted? I'm truly curious. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 22:07:00
You forgot to downvote. Or did something i say make you grow up?
@_date: 2015-07-20 16:08:43
Idiot. 
Edit: i see you quickly removed the part of your post where you called me a sock puppet. Pathetic. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 19:52:56
Ok let me put it this way. Is there ANY bitcoiner here who feels bad for them?
@_date: 2015-07-18 20:52:48
I never ever seen so much fraud happen as with Bitcoin. Bitcoin attracts every scammer and fraudster on the internet is seems. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 01:40:24
Then we would be above 1200 right now. From 1200 to 250 is not an uptrend. 
Edit. What part is worth downvoting exactly?
@_date: 2015-07-19 14:16:02
Great, now apply your common sense to your question. 
@_date: 2015-07-18 21:19:24
Come on. 
Edit: oh i just realized who i replied to. Yeah, pointless. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 01:25:49
Yes he is full of shit but so is your logic. 
@_date: 2015-07-18 23:20:54
No. That's one of the great features of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 16:58:06
The only thing that happened was traders taking advantage of the situation. Just like the 50 previous times this sub thought "it was happening". Maybe after 50 more times you also will get it. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 16:09:33
It should grow? Why? What is this based on other than wishful thinking? And what about Greece?
@_date: 2015-07-20 16:48:11
Easy! Just wait up to 1 hour for your internet money of the future to go through!
Upvoted 6 times. This place keeps amazing me every single day. 
And in the next thread someone will complain about the waiting times and the reply will be "easy, just use 0 confirmations as double spends rarely ever happen" and it will be upvoted many times because nothing is ever a problem with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 00:53:10
Poor guys. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 00:40:49
An uptrend that's been going down for a week. Quite amazing. 
Man, what exactly are you people downvoting?
This place is crazy! Someone asks a question and only one answer is allowed. Eventhough it is false as everyone can see by looking at any Bitcoin chart. 
There is something seriously wrong with this sub. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 13:47:22
@_date: 2015-07-19 14:46:51
You must have confused me for someone else. I couldn't care less if Bitcoin gets big or not. I'm just pointing out that this sub tries to pump Bitcoin every day, all day long. They want anything from small companies to huge countries to use it while at this stage it's pretty much unusable. And i don't care. Just giving a friendly tip to this sub. 
By the way you should do something about your rage and mouth foaming. If a normal comment on the internet already does this to you i'd hate to see what happens when someone accidentally bumps into you on the street. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 13:00:35
How would that be an opportunity for Bitcoin exactly?
@_date: 2015-07-16 23:21:16
Greece is out. South America is so hot right now. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 23:54:30
Who came up with this ridiculous idea that it's somehow just like email? I cringe everytime i see these comments. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 15:41:55
Step out of this sub for a moment and into the real world. Into reality. 
A site like that with Bitcoin only payments will fail. You'll reach 0.0001 of your potential customers. 
Replace Bitcoin with Zimbabwean dollars. Would you make a site only accepting that currency? 
@_date: 2015-07-19 19:01:41


He told you that?
@_date: 2015-07-20 20:05:29
Le's stop playing this silly game. Let's stop talking about lack of substance and other bs. 
Fact is i get downvoted because i'm not joining the circle jerk and they don't allow that here. I know that, you know that and everyone who visits this sub knows that. Please, stop pretending it's anything else. 
And the fact that you won't answer me if not because i bring nothing to the table but because you'd have to admit the above. Which you refuse to. Because you are a bitcoiner. It's really that simple. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 18:04:30
Bitcoiners HATE paypal. They consider it an evil statist fiat slave company that should be avoided at any cost. 
But not when they mention Bitcoin. Then Bitcoiners absolutely LOVE Paypal and will upvote it straight to the top. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 16:29:46
Yup. Thread didn't go as he hoped it would. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 06:11:25
How old are you? 15?
@_date: 2015-07-20 16:36:56
Examples of questions that have nothing to do with you?
@_date: 2015-07-19 13:50:45
This isn't about just buying some coins at Circle. Stop downplaying the issue. You know damn well what i'm talking about. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 13:58:22
Riiiight. I'm so sorry. I didn't realize that this sub is strictly on topic and we only talk about Bitcoin here and NOTHING else, like gold and general financial news. Strictly Bitcoin!
Totally my bad. Won't happen again. This obviously deserves to be downvoted to absolute hell. Not just -5 so that it dissapears but even more on top that. Looking back i can see what a horrible, horrible comment it is. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 15:31:39
Why would i hold? What will happen if i hold?
@_date: 2015-07-20 12:29:48
Or Dogecoin. 
Holy downvotes Batman. 
So what part of my post is so wrong that i deserve all these downvotes?
@_date: 2015-07-20 14:18:27
And get 0.001% of their sign ups in Bitcoin. 
Sounds like an amazing deal. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 01:52:15
Your logic is bad, very bad. I'm not even gonna discuss it. That's how bad it is. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 00:25:33
Did your mom always tell you you are really special?
@_date: 2015-07-19 06:24:57
My god. I've seen many delusions here but you take it to a whole new level. 
And upvoted 4 times? Wth. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 19:55:56
Good story. 
But how do you feel about those poor Greeks who put their savings in Bitcoin and lost a huge chunk in just one week?
@_date: 2015-07-18 20:57:10


Feel free to explain why. 
But we both know you won't answer that. 
@_date: 2015-07-18 22:28:43
Certainly. Just ask all the people who magically had it dissapear from their wallet. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 14:34:34
You posted in the wrong sub. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 19:47:52
Great story. 
But how do you feel about the fact that they lost a big part of their savings in just a week?
@_date: 2015-07-16 22:19:47
Do you really have to ask?
@_date: 2015-07-20 18:15:58
What does up to 1 hour mean exactly in your little fantasy world? Serious question. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 15:09:49
Ok. You're right. Bitcoin is known for how easy it is to use. You just buy some with your card and that's it. 
I was completely wrong. Sorry. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 10:57:42
Absolutely nothing. At least that's what this sub has been telling me for 2 years. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 21:24:51
To have a discussion. And you? 
@_date: 2015-07-19 14:57:19


@_date: 2015-07-19 15:41:54
Right. So the price simply can't go down?
@_date: 2015-07-20 18:42:25
Right. You got me. The Bitcoin ecosystem is absolutely booming!
@_date: 2015-07-19 18:50:37
What kind of drugs are you on right now?
@_date: 2015-07-19 00:13:51
No. 
Edit. When you downvoters look at the charts what exactly are you seeing? Are we going up or down?
@_date: 2015-07-20 12:45:59
This is a Bitcoin sub. There are already several off topic posts about gold on the page. Please stop with these posts. If i want to read about gold i'll go to the gold sub. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 19:17:06
Many. Here's one. 
Edit: downvoted? Seriously?
@_date: 2015-07-20 17:18:26
No. 
Ah downvoted of course. Sorry guys. Of course the only answered allowed is yes! Yes, Paypal will announce something Bitcoin related. I mean what else could it be!
@_date: 2015-07-19 13:45:22
Bitcoin exists for 6 years and it's still near impossible to use for the average Joe without getting help. And these are 20-40 year old white males who work with computers. 
How about we work on this first before trying to convince whole countries to move to Bitcoin?
Ffs! Can we ever just discuss something here without right away getting downvoted because you point out things people don't like to hear?
Why do you people come to a messageboard in the first place if you just want to censor everyone you don't agree with!
@_date: 2015-07-20 19:45:23
I don't need any upvotes. It's just insane that people here rage downvote you if you type something they don't like. Maybe they should stop coming to public forums. 
And devoid of substance? Wtf?
@_date: 2015-07-16 21:49:52
Are you really this thick?
Oh look, you can downvote me again. You must have a very exciting life. Trying to censor people on public messageboards because you can't handle their answers. My god...
@_date: 2015-07-20 17:01:08
Don't listen to me man. What do i know. Please go ahead and spend those 100 coins. Please do. 
Don't forget to keep us updated. Looking forward to it. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 14:01:43


Please man. Just stop. Let's not start playing this silly game. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 13:48:51
Use some common sense. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 19:51:20
Yes because it's impossible to read without having an account. 
Also what part of my post made you downvote me? Is there anything in my post not correct? 
@_date: 2015-07-20 23:00:03
If they accepted Bitcoin they would still require your info. That's how these sites work. Bitcoin won't change that. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 01:57:14
No, i don't know you're right. Calm down. You seem extremely paranoid. It's just a message board. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 08:54:27
No. Just like a month ago nobody in Greece knows or cares about Bitcoin. 
How much longer do you people need before you realize this? It can't be this hard to understand??
Yes, downvoting me will make it less true.
@_date: 2015-07-19 15:52:16
Or when you don't get your product or when you buy stolen shit or in 100's of other situations. 
My comment still stands. 
Please don't act like there is less fraud when using Bitcoin. Everybody, as in every single person here knows this is not the case.
