AdBlock is fine as long as only a minority of the users use it. If it was to be embedded on browsers by default, the web would literally collapse. You would have to say goodbye to this free media, the few websites left would be have to be financed with other means, like with your taxes.
So, to everyone complaining for the bandwidth wasted by advertising: You are pathetic. You think the bandwidth we used to serve your content was free, along with the server, coding, maintenance, content production?
Go ahead, let your blind ignorance destroy the web.

Absolutely no. You are asked to insert a *new* password, and to send a PM to a bitcointalk.org user to verify that you really own the account you are linking from (the PM is an unique authentication code).
So that part is perfectly safe.
If you decide to post from Bitcointa.lk, you are asked to install a browser extension, that is needed to post the same message on Bitcointalk.org. The browser extension is quite simple and open source. I've written it with the goal of giving me (Bitcointa.lk) as less access as possible.
For example, it can't read your PMs, but he will alert you on Bitcointa.lk if you have unreads one.
You can find the source code on GitHub:

@_date: 2014-03-12 22:44:37
Yes, if you change your post/thread after posting it there will be an old version on Bitcointa.lk. I'm still trying to figure out a wise way of synching moderations/edits.
Sticked posts is part of the moderations activity, that for now isn't synched.
The positive of this is that for example this [HashFast thread]( has 382 posts on Bitcointa.lk and half of that on Bitcointalk.org. That's because it's a self moderated one, and content deleted from Bitcointalk.org is not on Bitcointa.lk

Wait, you are seriously putting CT and HF/BFL on the same plate?
There is a lot of ignorance in this post, but it's fine. Time will tell you what is what. For instance, when CT realised that they were to miss their december date, they offered their customers to switch to the January batch for free, that was priced at half the price point.
HF? HF sold products at 5 times the market price because of their promises to ship in October, and they have yet to ship. Want more? 
As far as i know there is no equivalent for CT, there might be a reason for that.

I took tens of flights with them and never had a problem. We once had to change the landing airport due to fog (the one we were landing at was lacking a decent ILS), and it was the best landing ever (you basically couldn't see the runway until touchdown).
So... You can fuck off.

I have bad news. If you want to post on Bitcointa.lk a browser extension is needed to bypass the same origin policy of your browser. Unfortunately most mobile browser don't support those extensions (Firefox Mobile does, for instance, but i've yet to write compatible code). I plan to address this problem in the future.
So for now it's only a handy way of *reading* Bitcointalk (but not writing). ;)

Thanks for the question. Here is the general picture: SMF is a 10 years old forum board. XenForo, the software used on Bitcointa.lk, is not.
We have a modern design with modern features. It's a solid base to build over, and it's perfectly in sync with Bitcointalk.org.
One feature i like are the in-site Notifications (if you link an account you will see your old Notifications, one for each time your posts were quoted). You can customise them as you wish, for watched threads, for new replies on a board you are following, etc.

They sent your friend several email reminders before he arrived at the airport without tickets. You dont have to physically print them, you could simply show the qr code at the airport. Ryanair gets the job done and its cheap. Yes, there are overcharges for breathing too much and the pilot will wake you up in the middle of the flight trying to sell lottery tickets, but you will get used to it. In the end its the same as traveling in economy with whatever other airline.

This is how i see it: they own some people BTC, some others USD (deposits, rent, salaries, etc). For it to be fair, everyone will have to receive back the same % of the total value. This is why you don't have to sell 200k BTC, but only a share of it (if needed) in order to make the % of the returned value equal for every creditor.
By selling 200k BTC in an auction you actually lower it's value (since that the off the market auction would be at a price lower than the last Bitstamp ticket) while you could simply pay it back as it is, without selling it (again, apart from what is needed for everyone to receive around the same % of the total value back).

I like it when someone has completely different opinions.
I've never spent more than a few days without internet in years, so checking in from my phone is a non issue. The qrcode is safe, if they can't read it they will simply check manually for your sequential id.
Their website is full of tricks to make you pay more, but thats not something I'm denying (or something that bothers me). Many other airliners will ask you to book a place for an extra, and I know of some that won't even let you check in in advance without paying extra to select your seat (so that would have to arrive at the airport in advance to check in there).
I guess that it depends, but my only Ryanair flight that arrived (not departed) late was the one deviated for fog. I had to wait multiple times for delayed flights even 6 or more hours, but never with ryanair (I'm dont have statistically relevant numbers, but I travel a lot).
So... Back to topic... I hope them to start accepting btc.

I completely disagree. A fork is a fork. One where you don't know the fork date is more dangerous than one where you do know and are looking forward for it. Consensus has to be reached in both cases. I would argue that lowering the block time to 5 minutes should be more acceptable than upping the block size to 20MB.
Bitcoin-1MB and Bitcoin-20MB are going to be two different Bitcoin anyway. There is no reason not to have faster blocks at that point. About the rounding error, I don't think that to be the case at least for many years to come. I'm not sure about what will happen when you will try to divide 3 satoshi by 4 instead of 2, but that's not really something that concerns me.

That's only unless a replace-by-fee market develops, that will probably happen sooner or later. I was off course using a coffee as a metaphor for a small transaction. There would still be need for payment channels for real coffee transactions, but if you wanted to broadcast lower security transactions in the blockchain accepting only one verification, you could (and given that the avg. verification time would be 30 seconds, you could still run after the client that stole your coffee in a worst case scenario).

I think that the attacker wouldn't, because they wouldn't have to propagate blocks across the network at the risk of loosing them, but just use them to build the longer chain locally and then publish it after a while. The then smaller chain would be orphaned and the attack would be completed (repeat as needed).

@_date: 2015-05-07 15:50:57
So you are saying that you can verify (say) 100 tps with less than 100 iops? Probably yes, if you had the whole blockchain in RAM. But you don't. Too expensive.
Please expand on how a mechanical disk will fit the bill once that we have more than a few transactions per second. And not enough cache for it, because you know, at 20MB the blockchain could be growing of 2GB a day.

It isn't. The ram usage of the utxo in your case is capped to much less than that. No need for swapping.
I was wondering, is 3.5GB the full uncompressed data in ram? How much would indexes only be? How slower would it be not to have indexes and use a filesystem like data storage? Basically, with a little ram and a common SSD, what's the tps limit?
@_date: 2015-05-10 15:57:48
As I said in the same paragraph miners with slower connections could always mine smaller blocks. And I personally think your assumptions about ISPs and countries to be wrong. Who solo mines publishing blocks with their ISP nowadays? It's more about how much you can pay for your peering/transport connections, rather than rich vs poor countries.

Polis (/ˈpɒlɨs/; Greek: πόλις [pólis]), plural poleis (/ˈpɒleɪz/, πόλεις [póleːs]) literally means city in Greek. It can also mean citizenship and body of citizens. In modern historiography, polis is normally used to indicate the ancient Greek city-states, like Classical Athens and its contemporaries, and thus is often translated as "city-state".

The spike is most probably due to the indictment released yesterday for 7 people running a Bitcoin exchange.

* 1) Him supporting replace by fee (please tell me why any user would want that if not to make bitcoin less valuable or scam with it)
* 2) Him supporting lightning network and bragging about how increasing the block sizes would break the incentives
* 3) Another thread about how increasing the block size would kill the perfect as they are fee incentives
* 4) Him complaining again that "a lot of people think layer 2 is needed"
* 5) Him telling people making good questions about the consensus process and not getting any valid answer that they should go discuss about it in a specifically created ml named "bitcoin-process"

Bandwidth won't have any problem getting orders of magnitude cheaper. I can get a 1Gbps unmetered link today for $500 a month or so. 10Gbps for $1k. The problem is the storage and the processing of those blocks, if we go anywhere near VISA the network will have to centralise, since that running a full node can't be done for a hobby. If we go "full VISA" we will have only a handful of full nodes that costs in the millions a year to maintain. But again, you can get 10Gbps for $1k today, so bandwidth is not the problem.

@_date: 2013-10-04 20:49:48
You are right, that database is a good start. Xenforo integrates it by default.
However, asking your italian users "how many are the state owned tv networks in italy" is priceless :)

HF was overconfident and overpromised. Let me add, they overlied. BFL is in a far better situation.

Website is down, destination ip has changed, registrar has changed too.
    localhost:~ davide$ whois bitcointalk.org
    Domain ID:D162601474-LROR
    Domain Name:BITCOINTALK.ORG
    Created On:24-Jun-2011 05:19:00 UTC
    **Last Updated On:02-May-2013 18:45:06 UTC**
    Expiration Date:24-Jun-2022 05:19:00 UTC
I ping the server more than 130ms (184.170.143.141), and the last time i checked the server was in the central europe, that i should ping 40ms.
I own btct.lk and bitcointa.lk, and i changed the destination ips of these domains to 109.201.133.65, that appears to be the old ip (the one in use until a few hours ago). Unfortunately the server forces a redirect to bitcointalk.org, so it's useless.
**Just edit your hostfile and add this line:**
    109.201.133.65 bitcointalk.org
Bitcointalk.org is now working fine from me.
There never is a boring day here with bitcoin.

this is what i think he have tough of.

2^256 is greather than the number of atoms in the visible universe (i'm actually not really sure, since that i did the calculations myself, but it should be almost right).
@_date: 2013-10-08 07:36:25
it's called retargeting.
@_date: 2013-10-05 12:53:53
I already did that, but i can't seem to convince anyone to temporaneally move there.

Insert that line on your host file.

I moved to Letterkenny from Italy just a few days ago, and i would have loved to go to a Dublin meeting. Who cares if i need to travel like 6 hours?
Hope to be there next time.
Keep me updated if possible.
@_date: 2013-10-05 18:26:19
online from yesterday, was bored to wait for theymos.
@_date: 2013-10-05 19:03:57




Thank you.
I have administrated a successful forum since 2007 and i run a cluster that handles tens of millions of page views every day. This is why I created an alternative yesterday and i spent the whole time posting it and having it downvoted. However, here it is.
@_date: 2013-10-05 22:22:26
You see? it works.
@_date: 2013-10-06 09:04:55
on my forum i don't use such stupid practices. (now downvote me again)
@_date: 2013-10-01 17:07:37
Your website is behind cloudflare. How did they get the website ip in first instance? Sent email headers?
@_date: 2013-09-15 14:21:56
You would fly to ny to buy 100-300$?
@_date: 2013-06-19 15:06:24
10^77 vs 10^80. I can live with it.
@_date: 2013-10-05 17:31:30
Domain by proxy, domain by proxy all the time.
@_date: 2013-10-04 12:04:57
OK, how much do you want as bounty?
I'm sorry, but you are completely wrong, you grow up reading comments online on how php sucks, while that is completely wrong.
I guess that if the forum where java or python based (or maybe, why not ruby on rails), you wouldn't argue about its safety.
Well, spot news for you, many of these alternative have some really security iusses.
@_date: 2013-10-05 17:56:04
It's theymos, not thermos (osx?). They are unable to secure their forums, unable to host it, and unable to moderate it. IMHO, they are a problem for the bitcoin community, while they should be a point of strength.
This is why i'm gonna spam my newly created forum, bitcointa.lk, and invite you and anyone else to use it, on every reddit post i find talking about this situation.
Please bear with me.
@_date: 2013-10-04 11:57:31
10BTC if you hack btct.lk. From my own money, not from user donations.
Just to prove you wrong, php is secure. Kiddy programmers is what make it insecure.
@_date: 2013-05-03 10:53:50
guy downvoted this post and the OP, without any explaination. So that i will never make it to the home page. Thank you, dear! Is this how reddit works? well, i hate it.
@_date: 2013-10-05 22:04:28
I don't have to instruct you on how RoR is vulnerable, right? Because it's one of the worst ideas out there - even php beat that. I was trying to make a joke with my comment.
@_date: 2013-04-14 13:22:32
how do you p2p fiat?
@_date: 2013-10-04 09:12:24
I know, i agree and it's what it's one of the tactics i use on my other major websites. However, i've putted this online in 2 hours and xenforo doesn't offer an "don't ask the user the email address during the registration" option.
Anyway, i will enable guest posting. I can do that without touching a line of code. I will also edit the registration form to cut off any non required data, such as the email address (and the date of birth, another think i don't like to ask).
Happy for the feedback, thanks.
@_date: 2013-05-03 09:45:37
I registered bitcointa.lk and btct.lk a few days ago. I'm tired of that 2000-like SMF board, and i'm tired of all the scam going on on your community.
Please use some of the ton of money you have to design a better board and find a way to relegate all the possible scams in an area that can optionally be hidden from your users.
I don't want, i don't have the time or the will, to start an alternative forum and to market it, but i can assure you that i have a lot of experience in this field and that if you don't act promptly to improve your community, i or someone else will sooner or later come out with an alternative and eat the majority of your userbase.
@_date: 2013-10-04 12:33:13
It's only because you are using a not popular forum package. Try using vbulletin or such. The only think that will save you are custom q&amp;a targeted on your userbase (such as, how many bitcoins are made per day?)
@_date: 2013-05-03 11:28:02
i posted on it after posting this. this is more direct and gives a fast solution.
@_date: 2013-10-03 19:25:42
I couldn't expect nothing more than a failure of a launch, and it's what happened.
2 hours wasted... Well, at least i tried.
@_date: 2013-10-06 21:40:35
Well, labcoin is a now know scam. There is a good post here in reddit talking about it.
@_date: 2013-05-03 10:13:36
@ everyone downvoting, please come out with a better explaination.
@_date: 2013-10-05 20:58:54
No one has ever received anything from Cointerra, as far as i know, they have yet to tapeout (yet to start the chip production).
The only competitive pricing they have is scheduled for next year, and noone can predict the difficulty at such a far date.
Just keep your bitcoins and don't gamble with them.
@_date: 2013-05-03 11:35:45
it's not a dns problems and you should have reasons to be worried. The domain was stoled, full point. It's all part of a cospiracy to crash the price? Probably. Will i buy the falling knife? No.
You don't want that kind of title in the homepage because it would bring to panic selling? I'm out from 110 yesterday, it's your problem.
We will enjoy this during the next days.
Downvote me to death, i don't care, i already lost to much time here today.
@_date: 2013-10-04 08:55:49
In the meanwhile, i spam my alternative forum. You don't even have to use a valid email, and the software is really great (if you have never tried xenforo before, do it).
@_date: 2013-10-05 22:32:27
Why don't you come up with better alternatives and with or with a list of previous experiences? I would be glad to hear that.
Oh, wait, you probably don't have any.
Now downvote me again, it's starting to getting funny.
@_date: 2013-05-03 13:23:53
There is terrible and terrible. Xenforo, IPB, vBulletin, are all orders of magnitude better than a 10 years old smf installation.
@_date: 2013-09-05 09:36:56
How could that be a fake?
Embedded in another website, it's just the proof that someone that could wanted to make that video and publish it there. Eg, it's not the standard blogpost made by a standard employee.
I'm super bullish.
@_date: 2013-10-05 18:05:54
It's the default design for XenForo, and while it could be done better, it's still orders of magnitude above the 2005 SMF bitcointalk uses.
The user experience is actually great, probably one of the best forum softwares out there. It was created by 2 of the leading developers of vBulletin, after that they decided to leave the company. In-site notifications, responsive design, great posting interface etc.
I'm sorry but i don't agree with you of it being ugly.
@_date: 2013-09-13 21:42:24
I don't. It's not about money. It's about an idea.
@_date: 2013-09-24 17:26:51
Don't worry, we do.
@_date: 2013-10-04 15:02:36
Contact sales, they will confirm it.
Maybe they are just delaying the mass emailing in order not to be catch up into spam filters and you will receive it in a while.
@_date: 2013-10-05 22:19:00
No, downvote everything.
@_date: 2013-09-29 06:17:52
and you will translate it using google translate, right? Since that you don't know Esperanto or Lojban.
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:31:26
2000 hours for 200$, does someone really cares?
@_date: 2013-10-06 07:59:49
Look, another xenforo based one. They will claim that php sucks, that xenforo sucks, that the design is ugly, and they will downvote you to death. -30 points in my case.
It will be funny!
And btw yes, reddit owns every forum! Reddit is the way! We don't need forums anymore! And if that was not enough, they all have fantastic ideas (200+) on how to make a forum better! Forum is so much 2000!

You should ask the main bitcoin news sources the reason for this (CoinDesk, anyone thinks that CoinDesk isn't in the payroll of almost every scam in Bitcoin?)
EDIT: the post linked was removed. Here is an alternative:
@_date: 2013-10-05 21:53:39
I will keep posting it until a better and solid alternative comes up, who cares about the downvotes?
Hei redditor downvoters, downvote me. It's the only thing you are great at.
@_date: 2013-10-04 10:13:33
And they all promptly gets downvoted to death in reddit.

Are you a batch 1 or 2 customer?
@_date: 2013-10-05 19:40:44
Why not Ruby on Rails? A friend of mine told me that i should use it, it's really safe.
@_date: 2013-09-26 08:15:48
Nginx and PHP-FPM sucks.
@_date: 2013-10-04 12:38:32
Yes, it's uber popular. You should be full of spam. Maybe they never found your website address?
@_date: 2013-10-05 20:29:27


I've never agreed with that webpost, and people smarter than me already made loads of good points on it.
What you are suggesting is basically security trough obscurity.

Now the form generates a random email for you. Only insert your username and password combination, and you are done.

Just click on that next time ;)

Take bitcointalk.org and move it to a platform that wasn't created 10 years ago.
Everything else can simply wait.

actually email verification is completely useless to prevent spammers...

these exchanges will all share the same order book, an order book composed of hundreds of different exchanges. I think that a bank escrow account where withdraws are possible only with the signature of both party (exchange 1 and exchange 2) should guarantee against any problem with transferring fiat at a later time.
@_date: 2013-10-05 18:55:55
People are starting to connect the dots...
@_date: 2013-10-05 19:38:58
1) sorry, but i won't invest any significant amount of time (i have more productive things to do) only to get a downvote. The forum has everything what is needed to start, the software is solid and proved. If it ever becomes even relatively popular, i will start taking care of it and/or pay someone to do it for me, releasing the data i can release (eg, post content) periodically. Since that the forum is of the community and not of it's owner, in this case. It's not my goal to make a profit out of it, i would be happy if only theymos followed some suggestions and tips here and there.
2) php safety. Sorry, but no, you are wrong. PHP 5 is a stable production software used in some of the most visited websites ever, and if you know the standard security practices, you are safe. The installed one is a standard version of the last version of XenForo, that was build from the beginning using these practices. I trust it, and i trust my abilities to secure a server. This is why i offered a 10BTC bounty if you can crack it (of my own money, not from user donations. If you are interested into trying to crack it but you don't think 10BTC is enought, please let me know, i will raise the amount; just for personal knowledge, noone ever hacked me).
Anyway, thanks for your constructive comment, i really appreciated it.
