you should check out and they're subreddits dedicated to the trading of items in their respective games. we use btc there on a daily basis as a medium of fund transfer. 
this is what's going on and why btc is so useful:
- one trader has a virtual item another trader wants to pay money for. 
- the gaming platform doesn't natively support the  transfer of funds. that is, you can only transfer items for items within the space provided by the game's company. 
- option 1 is that somebody sends their assets first, trusting that the other party will send theirs afterwards.
- option 2* is to use a reputable middleman within that community. the seller sends the item to the middleman, then once the seller confirms that the payment is received, the middleman hands the item to the buyer. 
- *the problem with option 2 is that the sellers often try to claim that they didn't receive the funds, it's quite difficult for the buyer to prove that the funds were received by the buyer. 
- option 3 is to use a middleman, but with btc. the seller gives the item to the middleman, and in all three parties agree on a public address and amount to be sent. from that point on the middleman just monitors the public address, once they've been sent he passes the item to the buyer. 
now, there are several markets dealing with virtual assets, and even more markets that don't inherently support the transfer of funds between parties. the creation of a totally intuitive, automated, trustless and decentralized bitcoin escrow service would be a game-changer. 
the only problem is that, although the blockchain provides us an effortless method to confirm and manage funds, the verification process for the transactions within each individual trade platform will have to be uniquely assigned. furthermore, every implementation of each design for each trade space will have to be open-sourced and managed by the community to try to prevent the loss of assets through errors in code.

I think coinbase also requires that you enter your name and address too, not just your card number. you should probably include that in your request.

buy with paypal, chargeback, keep bitcoins

why did you decide against letting the users be in control of their funds?
surely multi sig could have been the compromise?

oh that's interesting,
where can I read about using my iOS device to move funds from my trezor? I've looked at bitWallet and I'm not really understanding how I would manage. 
do I first connect my trezor to a computer and extract my seed somehow to then put into bitWallet? 
sorry if the answer to this is obvious, I'm not familiar with BIP encryption
