How is he confused? I have no idea whats going on but he managed to explain it in a way I could somewhat follow and everything he was calling out was coming to fruition. I'm not trying to poke, I'm genuinely curious what makes you think he's confused.

They are trying already. See etherium, lite coin, doge coin, etc.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:48:40
but why not just hold fiat like you would an Alt coin? Doesn't that cut out the middleman and their fee's, essentially making it free? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:04:42
Was gonna sell today to because I had a sinking feeling this was going to happen. I probably would have changed it for Ethereum though so I guess l still won out?

Any deposit over $10k is reported to the IRS. They check on you and make sure youre paying your taxes and got it from a legit source
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:12:52
pics?! I'm curious to see what you managed to get with your BTC
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:37:12
Lol, so you’re paying someone to pay your bill in USD? Doesn’t that defeat the whole purpose? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:09:06
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:42:40
But wasn’t the problem that people were pumping the price before it went live to give people the impression it was soaring so they wouldn’t sell, so those pumping could then dump at an extreme high? Also seemed like there was some discrepancy between coin bases rate and other markets

Only invest what you are willing to lose. Think about though what $100 is going to do for you. The “moon” that a lot of people on here talk about is what, 100k? So at 15k right now youre looking at $6-700 when and if it hits that. Thats some nice return but not really life changing. Now if you invested $500 and it hits 100k youre looking at a 3-4k return. Still not life changing but thats a decent vacation for essentially doing nothing

Id say keep doing what you’re doing and if they do try and shut you down, sue. Or at the very least it will gain publicity and spread the word of crypto currencies even more 
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:07:53
You should still be paying your taxes if you then bitcoin into us dollars
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:10:54
Think of it this way. You could invest (at least) a couple grand and even if you lost it all, whats a couple grand in your lifetime? Buuut if that couple grand turns into tens of thousands, well thats kind of life changing. Can you live with yourself if you lost 20 grand? If not, don’t go in that high. But remember, you need to diversify yo bonds nigga

I came to new looking for this thread. It seems so obvious that is what is going to happen. Sure you can hodl through the dip, but why not cash out now and buy back in after the dip and make even more? It could be real bad too because  there is probably going to be a lot of panic selling. 
Hell, if you're feeling extra risky, why not buy into predicting the dip and make some cash on top of that?
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:03:59
So why would anyone want to be a part of a market like that?
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:02:01
Buying bitcoin is not difficult. Storing and using Bitcoin is
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:34:05
How does Bitcoin work better? You can say a lot about Bitcoin compared to USD, but works better is not one of them
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:37:29
And this will ultimately be bitcoins downfall 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:03:10
Supply and demand. There is a finite amount of supply and as the demand increase so does the value. The good thing is that your supply purchasing power increases. So while you may only have one bitcoin, that can buy you more the further it goes up. For it to jump so rapidly, some major players must have entered the market. Theoretically it should just keep going up because its still becoming mainstream and people who werent in before are getting in now. What would drive it down would be for major players to sell off, but i would think anyone thats in it at the moment is probably in for the long ride. There may be a slight dip, but from what ive gathered the bitcoin following is expecting much bigger things in the future than just 10k
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:36:17
Theoretically speaking it could grow to $100,000 but I personally dont understand how its gotten this far. I got in a while ago with $500 and have more than doubled my money so...����‍♂️

Remember kids, you should always listen to someone who makes a stick-figure drawing. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 17:30:05
This doesnt make sense, wouldnt that mean the price could never go down? How does the price go down? The coins are ALWAYS in someones hands...
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:00:41
You're essentially selling someone else's stock preemptively with the idea that it will lose value. When you short, you eventually have to buy that stock back to replace the ones you sold, but you're doing it at a much lower value than when you sold. Its like buying stock but in reverse? Some stock can benefit from this, such as Tesla, because all these people did this, but the stock never actually went down. When it doesn't go down, the people that short'ed had to buy back at a higher cost, driving the stock even further up. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 20:22:26
Good point. Its more like a pyramid scheme 
@_date: 2017-07-11 20:02:19
The amount of electricity it takes to mine the coins isnt offset by the amount youre getting back as reward 
@_date: 2017-05-07 13:14:32
So bitcoin as it stands is practically impossible to use at a brick and mortar store because of the verification time? Also, if Im a business owner looking to use bitcoin for currency, i could wait a potential week for my customers transaction to verify before I could send them the goods? Possibly not even get verified and is just dropped? 
@_date: 2017-05-05 13:06:00
Its always an inside job. If it seems obvious, its usually the answer. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 02:21:18
Hm, Ponzi scheme seems like the perfect way to explain it 
@_date: 2017-05-07 14:17:17
So why on earth do people think this is the future of currency? Sounds way to complicated for the majority of people and way to expensive for everyday transactions. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 02:19:39
So ultimately does it have value if no one is willing to spend it? And are businesses going to adopt it if no one is using it? Seems like its working against itself 
@_date: 2017-05-07 02:27:03
Wasnt there also a guy on here the other day asking people to track down his stolen bitcoins worth half a million by todays pricing?
@_date: 2017-07-11 11:51:48
theres no point now because it doesnt economically make sense but it has to do with computers solving complex equations called blocks. Once a block has been "solved" theres a possibility for bitcoin to be revealed
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:45:22
I dont get it, why would anyone want physical currency? Isnt the whole point to be digital for ease of use/security/borderless? 
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:10:00
Then whats the point of bitcoin?
