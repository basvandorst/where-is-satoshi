decent. I'm imagining a future, like 2100 or so where bitcoin is the monetary system of the world. 
and instead of saying "i got into bitcoin in 2018" it would be cooler to say "i got into bitcoin during the 2nd halving"
or maybe it would just be "i got into bitcoin before the third halving"
and people who get in in say 2032 would say, I got into bitcoin during the 6th halving"
It doesn't sound great to me though, hence the post. 
Something like 3rd epoch sounds better.
Isn't there some sort of similar terminology in Hunger Games? It's eluding me and bothersome.

What? They raise the initial 500 million in exchange for the ETF notes. They then spend that money on BTC. They have no more money, and the BTC is now owned by the ETF holders.

what i'm saying is it doesn't matter. after the initial basket of BTC is bought by the ETF creator, it is not buying any more BTC. so even if the general public decides to buy $10 billion shares worth of the etf, no more bitcoin is being bought. it's only increasing the share premium.

They buy bitcoin will ALL the money they initially get. They don't have more. They'd have to raise more money again

hi res plz
@_date: 2019-12-30 19:38:03
that's the reason it would go up. from additional btc being hodl'd, but people buying etf shares shouldn't matter, at least not directly.

Buy more with what money?
