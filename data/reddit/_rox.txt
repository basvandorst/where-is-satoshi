Yeah, just like all the past jumps were clear. If anything is actually clear the market immediately accounts for it. It was anyone's guess, just like it is now.

Can you stop? I've sent multiple times in the last few days for 8 to 9 and once for $11 to get it to confirm in 20 min. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:26:14
Yes, but make sure electrum is updated as there was a voulnerability that was patched recently. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:02:38
Exactly, MS sells the BTC so why should your purchasing power shift afterwards? Every crypto currency fluctuates a ton. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:53:47
Most who have power to actually affect price already have accounts with exchanges

When btc is mainstream you'll just be able to spend it as normal money is what he's saying, that's the hope anyway :)

In order for us all to swim in the pool, we need to fill it with water first, and then when someone starts making waves that are too big, we can turn it into an ocean, so that it's much harder to make big waves.

Spending it directly one day or "cashing out" to USD are one and the same.

I can't wait to pay the IRS asap! Said no one ever. Waiting till 2018 to take profits defers tax liability till 2019.

The new s2x is a scam. They even promised people a cut of satoshis coins... Lol. As if they have a right to manipulate and distribute the chain like that. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:05:59
Relatively speaking, coinbase to mtgox is like a house to a pillow fort. Both volnurable yes but not on the same level. Lots was learned from that disaster and while I'm not saying it can't happen again it's never their goal to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:00:31
Yes, also there was a mass exit a bit ago when the bch fork happened, and it acted like a soft audit for them.

Your link triggers my antivirus. Just a heads up.

Wish Canada was higher. If the Canadians do it, it somehow makes it more legit :p

Those who have held the longest certainly haven't lost the most so far. I'd say day trading has carried the most risk. Edit: a word.
@_date: 2017-11-25 02:27:31
Why? It's all about relative gain. If Bitcoin was 8k and you buy $1000 of it, and it goes up 25% to 10k, you made $250. If Bitcoin was $80,000 and you buy $1000 of it, and it goes up 25% you also made $250. Granted yes, it's less likely to move up as fast the bigger it gets.  Just remember, there are no guarantees. If it was a 100% certain, it would already be at 10k. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 10:48:36
What happens when you decide to sell all your gold that you bought in 1970 for $38 now that it's worth 3000% more? If you sell it slow the price may not change since you'll find buyers slowly as needed. If you dump it fast you may need to sell it for less but you'll eventually find a buyer at some price if something is valuable. It's the way markets work after all. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:18:19
Not sure I follow but do you have atms or other means to acquire it at true cost? If so what's stopping you from just sending yourself atm coins to the exchange and selling them for the margin? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:08:09
Historically the swing percentage goes down, not up though.

Why wouldn't he?

Tell her that in the past you were a secret agent but the agency you worked for tried to have you killed and having found this out you enacted revenge. However the main guy disappeared but you recently learned of his hiding spot and must go on one last mission. Should you return, you'll call an end to that life and cash out your secret service coins. When she asks questions tell her there is no time to explain and then disappear for two days. Come back with a trezzor and live the life you want. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:32:06
Ah I see, yes that makes more sense :)
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:56:31
I mean the dudes point was it still exists for btc and not usd. Thereby being a speed bump in adoption. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:16:37
It's always going to rain. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:35:48
100 people that... agree with one another. Hard enough to find a few of those when their money isn't on the line lol. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:02:03
Right but the op's point was that you still have that as a negative when compared to fiat right now. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:03:51
That's not how deductions work. Legit donations are still a loss.

You pay a capital gains premium to spend more than $600 per year. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:14:12
That's probably the point 
@_date: 2018-03-23 08:28:53
Then they'll kill it 2 months later

The plates are a warning. He's keeping us from making the same mistake he did by getting out early. Has a Mercedes but could have had... the world. :P
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:44:22
Lol, expected. You know that when it's expected tomorrow, It'd have happened today? I use today and tomorrow as arbitrary ordered dates. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:08:48
Upgradable hashing algorithm and difficulty adjustments would stay ahead of that curve. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:22:20
Is the price being manipulated? Btc is linked at the hip to eth. It's like exactly equal investment is happening on both. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:06:13
Wonder how many of the compensated individuals will buy bitcoin with it again. I guess if 400 mill made it drop, 400 mill could send it back up too. Fomo works in both directions after all. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:52:48
His mouth doesn't move quite with the voice, is this legit or just video compression issue?

The only funny thing here is the insignificance of the fine (to a bank). 
@_date: 2017-10-26 08:37:30
Right but he's initiating a buy order on the btc chain and a sell order on the b2x chain. He's adding to the demand for BTC and to the supply of b2x, there by increasing BTC value and decreasing s2x. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:59:18
600 is also the amount you can pay a contractor without issuing them a 1099 (reporting it to the IRS) although they're supposed to anyway. Guessing it came from that. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 05:57:23
Lol, people acting crazy. The guy can buy back in now that he doesn't have to pay that, what do you call it? Oh yah, a mortgage...  Also he sold at a high so if it does a temp pullback, he's ahead of the game. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:03:52
what..? a 100% of what? What cost basis will they use?
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:01:51
If he were to have somehow paid WITH bitcoint, would he still owe capital gains if it was not converted back into USD?  What I mean is. If I used actual gold that I had to buy a house, would the gov want me to figure out my cost basis of gold when I had acquired it? What if figuring that is impossible, like if the gold was a gift a long time ago, or hell, what if I found it in a wall of my house? 
@_date: 2017-05-09 14:11:23
Which exchange lets you buy so much at once? Genuinely curious.
@_date: 2017-05-15 06:20:39
The moment you believe said chart is the moment it becomes obsolete lol. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:11:05
Stop scaring him so much lol. There is a difference between short and long term capital gains. He has held the coins for a long time, so they will be considered long term capital gains. The most he should pay is 20% in the highest tax bracket, otherwise its 15%, or 0% if he is in the lowest two tiers, the 10 and the 15%. 
@_date: 2019-05-27 07:18:29
Sorry but how could it have happened. He said it would align with a reward halving which is may 2020?

CNBC is garbage, they'll promote all sides of anything. All they want are views and clicks to sell ads.
@_date: 2019-05-31 06:54:17
Hmm it's going to be tough getting into digital currency without a smart device. Possible for sure and ok if you want just sit on it but def more cumbersome to actually use it without one.
