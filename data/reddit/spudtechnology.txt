I pulled a short excerpt from this article that details my position on the matter.
"While Dotcom’s promises may simply be the bluster of an internet raconteur"
I simply do not believe in what he is saying and nor do I believe that his word has any weight. Logic leads me to believe he is soaking media attention from bitcoin for his upcoming launch. Just my opinion

I feel for him this behaviour is similar to a serial killers that leaves clues to be caught. However in the case its bitcoin and LE is far to behind the times lol.
