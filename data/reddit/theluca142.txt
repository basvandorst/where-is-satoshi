when is that?
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:15:56
ok will do
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:26:10
thank you for the input. I have a question: Based on which exchange site do they give you a value?
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:03:39
what does that mean? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:04:31
why 3 hours from now?
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:59:35
why? what can i do now?
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:16:31
thank you. but how will it affect someone who just wants to gain a little bit money with bitcoin and/or uses it to buy stuff online?
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:18:36
No for example I have 1 btc and it was worth 9000$ and then I see online a rise of 15 percent, in my wallet it still says 1 btc for 9k...
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:20:16
ah I think I understand it better now. so the private key is basically also the word seeds right?
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:14:51
But there will always be the small risk, that it gets hacked, the moment, I buy/sell them and they are on the exchange site...
The login data to the exchange site is not considered as the private key right? thats just a normal account from which I send the bitcoins to my wallet, which in my case will be a hardware wallet (=my bank account)
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:26:23
Thank you, but how can I secure my GDAX account, or is thin not necessary? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:06:46
Ok thanks. Is it important to send it quickly to the hardware wallet? And is this like drag and drop, where I get an account on the Exchange site, where I buy them, and then bring them somehow to my wallet? So the wallet already has an address to it or how does this work?

Some guy I know said with confidence to me about 1 hour before the massive price drop of btc, that I should wait just a little bit, because it will soon sink. And I lost it as it actually happened.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:29:35
ok thank you. how secure is this exactly? Do I have to scan my Computer for Viruses first, before I set up my Wallet? 
I am interested to buy the ledger nano s, does this already come with an address and private key (and seeds?), or do I set this up first?
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:05:45
So the only informations I need to keep safe are my private key and my seeds, which I need, in case I lose/break my wallet? But when I forget the private key, can I use the seeds instead, or how does that work? 
When I install it, it shows me 24 words, are these the seeds and the 5 digit code is my private key?
