This. I'm so tired of people trying to force segwit down someone else's throat. It's a UASF. Opt-in. If you don't like Coinbase, don't give them your business.

Censorship resistant gold you can store in your brain, and transmit globally in minutes for little to no fee (e.g. Segwit/LN). Seems pretty valuable to me.
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:13:46
No, in this case UASF was the correct move, but people need to understand the importance of "opt-in" features. The space is filled with people who have very little knowledge over the technical, political, and economical aspects of Bitcoin, but those seem to be the ones making the most noise on social media, unfortunately.

Solutions include: Stop using their service, create a new service, or support a service that has segwit implemented.
If they don't have a competitor in the space, we'll be complaining about them years to come. Competition drives innovation. Monopolies create stagnation and complacency.

That isn't true. The laws that prevent Wallstreet from investing in small businesses are the same laws that prevent them from investing in Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-18 20:11:13
If your premise is true, it's a good thing that Bitcoin isn't Blockstream, and Blockstream only makes up a part of the ecosystem. However, your premise is an assumption based on no facts, so I'm inclined to not believe you.

It's by design. It's not a big deal. People just don't understand the importance of it. Green energy is available at an near infinite scale.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:10:28
Tether is another perfect example of how not to use Bitcoin. Tether claims that each unit is backed by one USD. That means, for every single Tether out there, the company has $1 in a reserve to back it. Given that Tether was just hacked and lost over 30 million Tether from their own treasury and they have now blacklisted those Tether, what happens to that $30 million dollars. Looks to me they just made $30 million dollars on a hack to their own treasury. Not to mention that shortly after this hack, 50 million more Tether were created. I will believe all their claims once they undergo a formal audit. Until then, don't trust, verify.

I meant Amazon's adoption. Not user adoption. What is the ship time of a product in retail environments? Instant. Amazon just won't process your order until the payment is received/confirmed. People will pay a premium for speed (e.g. Amazon Prime). Want faster payment, pay a higher fee.

I'll let you do your own Google search for the definition of these words. 
If Bitcoin continues on the trajectory its on, which is not broken, then it will not be usurped. If Bitcoin breaks, let's just say devs and miners jump ship (won't happen), then there is a vacuum for a new cryptocurrency to replace it.

@_date: 2017-11-06 20:49:19
At the current scale of Bitcoin and present technological advancements, Bitcoin is better compared to gold as a *store of value* not a currency (however, it can be used as a currency). Bitcoin is as much as a commodity as gold. Consider the value of global p2p transactions and censorship resistant store of value.

Your investment needs to be for future use. Don't invest your $700 with the idea of selling it until you're an old man. This is how you make your money work for you. Finish your education and start your career, this is where you can make your money. Bitcoin is a better investment for that low of an investment, but start looking into DRIP stocks as well. Diversification is important.

Segwit is opt-in. It can be implemented into the core client, but it is not the default.
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:24:21
While you might be happy, as am I, others are not. For larger adoption, we need innovation, and companies need to be on board to help reach a larger audience. Coinbase so far has done a great job, and more companies like them will help in reaching the less tech savvy potential users of Bitcoin.

Luckily that opinion is shared by the devs and the people who truly love Bitcoin for what it is ;)
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:36:48
The computer science concept of a blockchain has been available since Turing complete languages have existed. You even said it yourself, *distributed*. Bitcoin essentially popularized the protocol with some other very important factors. Bitcoin is decentralized as well as censorship resistant. It is an open-source project that has its technological advancements pushed through with consensus and opt-in features. When talking about alt-coins that could potentially take over Bitcoin, it would have to all the features that make Bitcoin what it is today. However, the moment there is a feature that doesn't exist within Bitcoin that is desirable, Bitcoin has the capacity to absorb it (e.g. side-chain tech such as LN).
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:47:05
Core doesn't get to decide. Companies don't get to decide. Change has to come from the many to the few, and not from the few to the many. The proposed HF/blocksize increase was the idea of a few signers of an invalid agreement.

@_date: 2017-11-08 20:26:26
Yes and no. Wallstreet isn't a single entity. Traders would be competing against each other. So price would jump once they get in, but as traders compete to profits, we'll see less volatility. However, they'll be far more interested in their ETF trading than actual Bitcoin trading.

Blockstream is not Core. Core is not a united group of people or single entity. Core developers reference any developer who has made a commit to the Bitcoin project. Blockstream has no more power than any other Core developer. It seems you don't have a firm understanding of how open source development projects work.

Optin-in and off-chain options should be pursued first and foremost. After these options have been fleshed out, we should then consider a blocksize increase if needed (through gaining consensus). Solutions should come from the many to the few, not from the few to the many. Time line is hard to say, so I won't speculate.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:38:56

Please tell me where in my post it says that "ALL Bitcoin miners use only green energy." Some people drive hybrid vehicles, and some people drive diesel trucks. Same concept with mining. Your argument of the Kardashev scale is completely opinionated and not practical. Are you aware that in some locations there is too much energy not being used at all? These areas are now profiting off of Bitcoin mining whereas before there was no way to take advantage of this overabundance of energy. Bitcoin has the ability to bank the unbanked and provide a level of transparency to a global economy that we have never seen before. What you consider benefiting humanity isn't going to be the same as what someone else thinks.
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:49:32
Are you aware that if the price doesn't go up, then Bitcoin dies? As mining gets harder while the cost to mine stays consistent, the profit has to come from somewhere. New blood. Gotta love these posts where people try to frame the conversation of an entire sub, now 740k+.

The only reason to use a blockchain is for transparency. Other than that, it is a horrible way to store data. Slow and doesn't easily scale. If my bank handles in fiat (e.g. USD), and they're transparent with how they move money around, great! But..since they're not the only ones moving fiat around, their transparency doesn't mean much to me. How is the federal reserve moving it's money around? Where are my taxes going specifically?

BTC can't continue without ANY miners, however, which is my initial argument. When it becomes a net loss to mine Bitcoin because the prices has fallen too much, the miners will be financially incentivised to pursue an alternative to get a ROI on their equipment. I will admit, I don't ever see this being a problem, but I refuse to neglect the glaringly obvious evidence of the possible chain of events unfolding.

This all depends on whether you're trying to hide information from the IRS. If you are not, then it's simple. How much did you pay for a thing? How much of that thing did you sell? Did you make or lose money on the sale? If yes, then how much did you make?

@_date: 2017-09-26 15:01:21
Yes, but Bitcoin has a much larger backing (e.g. devs/miners/users) than the other block chains, and the POW and extensive ledger make it unique.

I seriously don't think this guys knows the definition of the word "fraud." According to him, Bitcoin is a fraud because it has no fixed value.

The energy consumption is by design. There is nothing wrong with it, and therefore no fix is required. If you make the system easily and inexpensively highjack-able, what is securing the value of your investment?

Right now, bitcoin is better suited as a store of value, much like gold. As the technology becomes more stable (quicker transaction times) and more users adopt the technology, we'll see a more stable price. When this time comes, then we will see bitcoin more widely used as a currency.

Of course the price of bitcoin is based off of supply and demand. I'm not disputing that. Just like your previous analogies/"fallacies", I'm not saying you have to know how a combustible engine works to drive a car, or for that matter sell one. Demand of bitcoin is only going to rise over the next coming years, and because the supply is limited, the price will have to rise. We will absolutely go through adjustments and corrections, but the price of bitcoin is far too low to be considered a bubble.

An exchange, such as Coinbase, is a single buyer. If 100 people want to sell their bitcoins in the same day, Coinbase won't turn them away, they'll just decrease how much they are will to purchase them for. That is why the price goes down.

There is a finite number of bitcoins that will ever exist. As more people adopt bitcoin the price of bitcoin will have to adjust (e.g. rise). When the adoption of bitcoin stabilizes, so will the price. Bitcoin isn't a bubble. It's barely the soapy water in the bottle.

The current energy consumption is based off the current demand. If demand decreases, less energy will be required to perform the same job. Visa is a closed system that isn't subjected to the same attack vector. Comparing the energy consumption of these two ecosystems is a mistake. You argument doesn't provide any specific information. You say it "doesn't need so much energy." Well, how much energy does it need? What is the exact number? If you are a big supporter of Bitcoin, I can't understand why its security isn't important to you. As a global currency/store of value with many powerful enemies, I am far more interested in its security then the energy consumption.

It is a political attack to begin with, but this answers most of it. However, he got a little mean at the end of his post, so I left that part out.
1) It's not the result of technical necessity, but a forced deal orchestrated by a group of would-be oligarchs who don't represent the community.
2) It seeks to remove the group of developers with a longstanding reputation for quality and integrity, and place development in the hands of a bumbling buffoon who will make changes at the behest of the aforementioned would-be oligarchs
3) The btc1 repo that 2x would be running on is a hacked together shitpile of Garzik rebasing in core, and adding ugly hacks.
4) Camouflaging nodes is indefensibly egregious and an outright attack.
5) No replay protection is tremendously dangerous.
6) There hasn't been nearly enough time for testing
7) The proposal is highly contentious

You're probably right that more average "joe" miners are good, but there are too many incentives for even the shadiest of organizations to not screw over the users of Bitcoin.The more complex the reward is to find, the more the system stabilizes, and dare I say it, becomes too big to fail (in reference to the cost it would take to out mine other miners to spoof the blockchain with false transactions). Back in the day, mining was a bit of a hobbyists play thing, but today it is a business. For miners to want to bite the hands that feed them will not only have to burn money doing so, but they will also have to deny additional future revenue opportunities. In the early days of Bitcoin, this would be easier, but today, I just don't see it happening. I think something like vertcoin could succeed if we see large scale mining die globally due to some type of legal crackdown, but what are the chances of that? That is a scary future that I hope we never see.

I actually would argue the opposite for this post. There are a lot of people that think Blockstream or Core have taking over Bitcoin, and therefore have turned it into a centralized product. However, anyone who really looks into this knows that all the Core devs have their own beliefs of what Bitcoin is, and they don't even all agree with each other. People forget that Bitcoin is an open source project, but there is a process for getting code in place. This process, I can assure you, does not require you to be employed by Blockstream. I think if Bitcoin is going to survive, it has to stay decentralized. This type of satire post will cause questions to be asked, and inquisitive minds will dig deeper into this topic. I'm not worried about two subreddits going back in forth with each other because Bitcoin is much bigger than these two echo chambers.  That being said, I did not post this comment to directly argue with you, and I appreciate your effort to keep people focused on the bigger picture. *tips hat*

Mainly just replay attack. It doesn't help that these forks result in alt-coins that steal the "Bitcoin" name, but unfortunately there are no laws to protect against that in this field. If people aren't careful, they could lose their Bitcoin before the replay protection can be HF on the main Bitcoin chain.

It is exactly that he doesn't understand the technology, and that is why he avoids tech companies. He proclaims so himself in his biography. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:28:54
Don't over think it. It isn't all about understanding software development concepts when evaluating what is happening. An attack is good for those pursuing the change, but an upgrade is good for Bitcoin. Look at the arguments objectively on both sides. Look at the track records of the people pushing the changes. To sum it up, if a hard fork is being proposed, replay protection is essential. It's like saying "we want to go this route instead, but we won't interfere with what you have going on."
@_date: 2017-09-22 17:58:02
Possibly, but there is no evidence to support that this is their intention.

No. EDA was implemented in the last HF with BCH. EDA gives incentives to miners to leave the BTC chain to mine on the BCH chain for a quick reward. Not something we'll have to work about with S2X though.

Yes, but to get Bitcoin you either buy it or mine it (or someone could just give it to you). So for my case, they could track my Bitcoin back to where I purchased it. To be truly anonymous with Bitcoin, there can't be any trails tying you back to your initial entry into the ecosystem. You also have to be conscious of what nodes you are transacting through. Your location can also be determined by your network traffic locations. The most simple example of this would be logging into your bank account while connected to a Starbuck's wifi.

Validity is based on logic, which he neglects to bring to the table when he debates Bitcoin. The guy has had numerous chances to discuss the topic, but he can't get past his bias to properly discuss the subject in a meaningful way. Someone in his position should know that the two forms of value can coexist, and any investor should get on board both options to diversify their investment portfolio. The guy could even make money on Bitcoin if he could get his audience buying it on his own exchange. If bickering and reality TV style discussions are your thing, then enjoy the stream.

Assuming replay protection is implemented, and only in this case, then you will benefit of having a duplicate amount of the second currency after the fork. BCH is still worth something, so you might be able to sell your copy-coin for fiat or other crypto.


If they didn't have bad intentions, they would happily be okay with implementing replay protection.
Please let me know if I can provide anymore details.
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:01:44
You could argue that it is currently affecting the price. If you have bitcoin prior to the fork you get free alt-coins after the fork. People might be buying to ensure they get these alt-coins.
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:09:25


That was also a hard fork, and yes you will get a new coin of mirroring quantity to your current holdings. Unfortunately there has yet to be an implementation of replay protection.

So Bitcoin Core wallet + full node on a computer is what I'm hearing would be ideal?
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:10:43
So what about the millions of dollars Japan just put into setting up their mining plants? Are you saying the high cost of mining makes Bitcoin less decentralized? I would argue that end-users that want to contribute to the network should run a full-node. While mining does contribute to the network, it is a vehicle for making money. If Jihan or Japan want to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to mine, of course they will have a leg up over the guy who only shows up with a single mining pan and a bucket. Even if Bitcoin went back to GPU mining, it would still have an enormous, albeit lower, barrier for entry. I will agree that it is not ideal the amount of mining occurring in China, but I think we will see more instances of countries and organizations making an effort to begin mining crypto-currencies as their value continues to rise. The beautiful thing about this ecosystem is the moment the miners try to pull some shady stunt, they'll also be pulling money right out of their own wallets. I'll have to check out vertcoin, but I fail to see that using specialized equipment to mine hurts Bitcoin. I will concede that my opinions sway more on the capitalist side, and I understand that many people will not agree with me.
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:37:19
Yes, but with breadwallet, we can link to the node of our choosing. Would you advocate against that and just go with a hardware wallet?

Yes, but right *now* it is a store of value. As new technologies get implemented (e.g. LN) and the price of BTC stabilizes post larger adoption, we can loosen the grip on our bitcoin wallets. This may seem to be a hard concept to understand, but gold isn't hurting because you can't shove of brick of the stuff into a vending machine for an energy drink. I am by no means telling anyone how they should spend their money. Just trying to spread the value of what it means to hodl.

Ever increasing the blocks is a short-term fix, but not a long-term solution. Side chain, second layer 2, technology allows for exponential growth within the Bitcoin blockchain. The developers understand how important it is to have a long-term scaling solution, but it does require a lot more work. Having a quick fix solution doesn't help anyone except for the miners who want more traffic.

I don't recall saying I took offense. I'm with you regarding media's poor representation of arguments, but Shiller has a responsibility as a highly regarded Nobel Prize-winning economist to provide clarity in his statements. There shouldn't be a need for "it seems to me" type arguments based on ambiguous responses when he has all the tools necessary for stating his position. Shiller is the least of my concern as he was very fair on stating his thoughts on bitcoin, and is overall knowledge base of the subject matter. However, how many economists have we seen shouting "bubble" because they saw the rapid growth of bitcoin this past year? As someone who is not an economist, I look to these individuals for wisdom, but if they are not going to bother educating themselves on bitcoin, along with the potential of its surrounding technology and innovative opportunities, they should not spread such buzzwords/FUD.

There are a plethora of reasons why the price has gone up, but to sum them up we've seen technology advancements for bitcoin this year as well as wider adoption. Simply comes down to supply and demand. Supply is limited and demand will only increase.

I think you are overestimating the anonymity of Bitcoin. Detectives and lawyers have both come out saying that Bitcoin made it easier to track activity regarding the Silk Road case. If you want to look at crime from a more objective point of view, how about assigning value to a currency, and then printing more whenever you want.
@_date: 2017-09-07 15:53:52
It is being consumed today, but it still early in its development. For most it is a great source of asset protection, and for others (e.g. Venezuelans) it is serving a real purpose of a functional currency where their government's currency has failed.

One of the main reasons BCH saw support was due to the lies regarding segwit (UASF). Roger claims that the signatures were removed from the blocks, and this is why they wanted the HF to occur prior to the segwit integration into the blockchain.

It does not yet have *strong* replay protection. Until I see strong replay protection in place, I consider it an attack.


The users and anyone else involved in Bitcoin casts their votes/opinions.
For example, I think a lot of people are on board with the Lightning Network. As better technologies and protocols are added to Bitcoin, the price has a better chance of going up as the product is *better*, but the price by principal is based off supply and demand.


While this might be true, they acknowledge that block sizes may be needed in the future. However, their decisions are based off of necessity, and at this time, there is no reason to increase the block sizes.
I think a lot of people who like to bash Blockstream and Core don't quite realize that all of these alts (BCH and S2x) could just as easily attract the attention of core developers. Bitcoin is an open-source project, and the users decide which chains live and die.

There is nothing wrong with Coinbase regarding their price. Market price of Bitcoin fluctuates so much that it is hard to find to numbers that are the same.

Companies don't hodl, nor should they. Any successful company puts their assets/money to work. They would like exchange their Bitcoin for fiat. If they don't keep the market healthy, it doesn't help them to be holding Bitcoin. Large companies will invest in assets such as stocks or other companies that they can hold onto and create valuation growth over time. Bitcoin doesn't do that in the same way because the volatility is out of any individual companies control. Think of it like checks. A company will accept checks, but they cash them shortly after receiving them. In this case, the Bitcoin and the check is just a transfer mechanism.
@_date: 2018-04-19 16:42:58


The task has been performing fine at 1 MB for quite a while, so if you *truly* agree, then there is no need for a block increase. Miners are not greater than any other users. Conflicting priorities aren't relevant here because all users are equal. Miners and companies don't like this truth because they want and feel entitled to more money, but Bitcoin isn't around to make anyone rich. You want to open the discussion, but it really just seems you want to stir the pot. You haven't provided any counter argument as to why the blocks should be increased except for the idea that the block size is an *arbitrary* value, which you also contradicted with the quoted statement above.
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:24:47
Yes. Bitcoin creates a transparent paper trail of sorts. There are ways of being more anonymous, but this comes at a convenience loss. For example, buying Bitcoin with cash locally vs an exchange that validates identity via CC/Banks/Paypal/etc.

Ignoring logic, huh? I wonder how much money you've lost.
@_date: 2018-04-19 16:22:04
The block size should be set as low as possible to do the task that is requested of it. 1 MB might seem arbitrary, but it was part of the initial design. The reason increasing the block size without a *need* is a bad idea is because all of these blocks have to propagate across all full nodes. Larger blocks lead to exponentially larger nodes. These larger nodes can deter users from running their own node, and at extremes, financially and technologically prevent the average user from being able to run a full node. Less nodes means less decentralization. The reason the block size discussion is silly is because it is a patch (e.g. bandaid) solution for short term results, but does not fix the real scaling issue. It's irresponsible and lazy development, and Bitcoin doesn't have room for such responses to potential problems.
@_date: 2018-04-02 15:46:52
Doesn't matter what they view it as. If it is being used as something, then it is then identified as that thing. If I use Bitcoin to waste money, then it's now also defined as a "waste of money." No *one* speaks for Bitcoin; *everyone* does.
