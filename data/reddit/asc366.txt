So how much was in it? ;+)
@_date: 2013-11-08 13:55:24
.. goal achieved :-)
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:30:41
Very very cool car man! I envy you a lil' bit too!
@_date: 2013-11-04 09:11:07
I've had the same idea as well. And, for the techsavvy's, toss in an asicminer erupter USB miner or something :)
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:15:16
You can't. Anyway, 40 tries/minute; that's way faster than I can type anyway :-)
@_date: 2013-11-08 13:47:32
Indeed, this transaction would've been just fine with a small fee too. There's been reports of a mixup with fee and amount before, but that's clearly not the case here as the amount is even higher than the fee.
@_date: 2013-11-12 18:41:14
That's what I put in the openingpost as what I already found, thanks anyway for your reply :-)
@_date: 2013-11-08 22:00:41
Decrypt it, and enter the decrypted privkey into bitcoin-qt (or other wallet)
@_date: 2013-11-09 23:37:09
Very nice. I'm still following and I too are not sure that the new thread is legit or a way to throw us of this attempt :)
Keep it up!
@_date: 2013-11-09 15:49:04
That mining doesn't seem to pay off, I'd buy and sell if I were you!
@_date: 2013-04-23 10:28:20
Congrats man!
 -- Hope you get better pie than this tough! ;-)
1BPqZbieQAtZEa6Fdo3iQZ1n1tvoTSWvF7 -- cheers!

Somebody just doubled the stakes 10 mins ago, it's now worth 0.225 BTC!
@_date: 2013-11-08 15:52:56
If he hadn't encrypt the key, this assignment would've been a whole lot easier!
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:11:54
lol rude
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:26:00
Noticed that .. nice :)
@_date: 2013-11-08 13:46:19
How's the bruteforcing going?
@_date: 2013-11-06 08:30:56
Very nice mate!
@_date: 2013-04-23 10:46:14
It's not a private key either, or at least bitaddress.org couldn't give me a pubkey for it.. But, happy bday nonetheless ;)
@_date: 2013-11-09 15:58:49
So, there's been a pretty big donation, it's now over 1BTC. Wondering where this ends and it'll be a nice tip for the owner of the privkey :-)
@_date: 2013-11-04 08:32:25
Thanks for the headsup. I've been in over my head in April, then took a break and now starting again. We'll see..... :-)
@_date: 2013-11-03 14:30:30
You are most likely correct. But, it might be fun along the way, and it's a bit of a nerd-hobby as well ... :-)
@_date: 2013-11-08 22:13:39
GTA V has three characters but that doesn't work.. :-)
@_date: 2013-11-06 08:23:50
You are a lucky guy ;-)
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:58:56
That's why they give you a "passphrase" with some words upon creation :-)
@_date: 2013-11-03 14:37:29
It's actually supposed to be a USB port -- that's the one hint I gave here away before she started drawing ;-)
@_date: 2013-11-09 23:28:20
I think you are spot-on and this is as far as I understand the "downside" of those free faucets. You have lots and lots of very tiny coins and those coins can hardly be moved at all without a fee as you have many inputs for a simple transaction
@_date: 2013-11-12 18:06:54
Too bad, the funds have been moved..
@_date: 2013-11-09 11:44:41
Thanks! :-)
@_date: 2013-04-23 10:39:20
I don't think this is a valid BTC address..
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:07:54
I like it how you actually took time to update the img with the amount of btc and not just reuse the previous one ;)
@_date: 2013-11-12 17:01:44
You got lots of tips by asking for tips. Wow. How would that work out in the real world for you? ;)
@_date: 2013-11-12 18:06:40
Too bad there's no reply at all in here indeed .. :-/
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:17:40
Hm another small fee, 0.01BTC was just put into this very address. Nice!
@_date: 2013-11-06 15:50:33


lol, horrible indeed :-)
@_date: 2013-11-08 21:59:54
This one is encrypted :-)
@_date: 2013-11-09 23:32:39
Well, I got a passphrase at least, when I created my wallet two weeks back.
@_date: 2013-11-08 14:13:53
Not too bad.
@_date: 2013-05-05 11:46:22
They run lots faster, see  for a comparison
@_date: 2013-11-11 23:08:33
Way overpriced! I got them at 8 eur a piece
@_date: 2013-11-09 23:29:30
Here's the reference from the wiki: "Otherwise, the reference implementation will round up the transaction size to the nearest thousand bytes and then add a fee of 0.0001 BTC per thousand bytes"
@_date: 2013-11-08 22:01:09
Makes sense .. hmm
