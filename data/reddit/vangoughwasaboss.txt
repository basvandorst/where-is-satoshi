yeh people get hacked but usually that's because of something they did wrong.  IF Authy was useless and hackers can just request some shit and bypass it then no one would use it or store anything hidden behind it.
@_date: 2019-03-27 18:24:10
how the fuck can it be bypassed through SMS if the device has no SMS hookup, the fuck are you even talking about bro....   What SMS is it going to route through when there is no fucking SMS/sim card attached to it...
And a even better question: If it was this simple to get around a 2FA authy why would anyone even bother with it and how would exchanges stay in business with their clients getting hacked immediately after putting funds in.... or maybe you're fuckin wrong lol
@_date: 2019-03-27 12:36:19
lol no it's not, my 2fa is on a device with no phone number/sim card.  Only thing is it doesn't like to work when I have it disconnected from wifi, so 99.9% of the time my 2FA device is turned off and disconnected.
Why you lying n' shit to try and make coinbase sound worse.....
@_date: 2019-03-26 01:17:14
I'd advise waiting, we could still see a lower low capitulation/final shakeout move pretty easily in the next few months.
@_date: 2019-03-19 19:21:54
market cycle psychology never changes, same shit now as it was back in the early 1900's stock market 
@_date: 2019-03-26 20:41:16
If your 2fa device is not connected to the internet or have a SIM card in it they can't do shit.
@_date: 2019-03-26 12:16:44
not really, if you mean timing as in hitting a top or bottom within 2-3% vs the actual literal bottom or top which is actually difficult.
Just layer buy orders from 2.9 down to 1.5k and go do something else for a few years, probably the easiest way to do it if you're already on board with some btc right here.
@_date: 2019-03-26 01:15:59
unpopular opinion: coinbase is a pretty safe place to store a coin or two if you use a good password and 2fa security.  
Like, better to leave it there then fuck with random software wallets that may or may not be any good when you're a noob to the whole space.
The real risky exchanges to leave shit on are the more obscure shitcoin ones.
@_date: 2019-03-26 17:15:27
My point is about noobs coming into the space and wanting some BTC.  Better to buy some and leave it on coinbase then get overwhelmed by the process of transferring/storing to wallets and so on and just not buy any as a result.
Realistically, coinbase ain't going anywhere.  Odds are on your side that the btc you buy now will be sitting there waiting for you in a year or two.
Ofc ideally people get a cold wallet and throw it on there, but idealism isn't realism.

srs I dunno what everyone's problem with coinbase is, it's fine to leave some shit on there and it's more trustworthy then a lot of the software wallets floating around trying to rekt newbs, just be sure to setup 2fa and use a unique hard to crack password.
@_date: 2019-06-16 12:21:11

aaand it's back.
It's a battle here, check back in a couple hours for a more definitive idea.  If it can open and close a 4 hour candle or two above 9k we're prob in business.
@_date: 2019-02-25 13:22:07
binance has never been hacked, if you're using 2fa security and have a good password and basic shit like that, you're fine.  People in this sub are a bit hyper with the "not your keys not your coin" stuff.  Like yeah there's a obscure risk binance or coinbase go tits up overnight and everyone is rekt but the odds are super low.  
It's the sketchy low volume small "exchanges" you gotta be super wary of.

@_date: 2018-11-20 03:27:55
The smart/experienced traders and technical analysts have had 2.9-3.3k area marked as a probable bottom for a long ass time.  Also 4-4.4K.  capitulation wicks decently below them possible but would need orders on the books beforehand to catch them.
There's another one around 1.3K but we won't talk about that yet, lmao... point is, anyone yelling about a bottom before one or both of those two above levels get tagged was huffing hopium.

that's the attraction ya genius.  Plenty of boring slow moving assets/commodities to trade/invest in already.

@_date: 2018-11-26 01:52:45
I know man I'm bull long term but my point in last post is why you don't over-invest, there's no guarantee btc is ever making a new high again.  Plenty of markets around that demonstrate that, they just blow off top and never recover.
@_date: 2018-11-20 03:35:50

Again, why the shit are you focusing on a ultimate top when that is NOT what is being discussed here...  
it's like missing a bus and being left stranded at the deserted bus stop and focusing on what the potential end point of said bus is when the bus is never coming back to your stop regardless of where it ends up.
Like the people who didn't buy the bottom area of '14/15 because they had a lower target in mind.  They still waiting cause their target never came and will never come.
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:52:42
btc been around for 10 years and you're focused on the people who bought in the last 12 months, lmao

looks bullish af, maybe you should zoom out farther then the hourly chart nomsayin'.  BTC been on a steady rise for 10 years, these pullbacks are when you buy (been like five 80% or worse pullbacks in btc's history)
@_date: 2018-11-26 20:34:38
lmao fuck off

@_date: 2018-11-24 19:22:08
sry to disappoint but it was reallllly obvious that shit was rocketing back out of there in a V bottom pretty quick after the initial reversal.  Very high volume bull wick following a capitulation death dive=hop on the bus cause it's gunna keep going for awhile, in this case it pulled a 100% move.  Just was way too early in the bear to create a permanent reversal, we should hopefully get something similar soon.
"Could" is a cop out, anything could happen doesn't mean the odds are in favor of it.
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:42:34
just like the targets kept getting raised on the way up because the value kept exploding.  "muh 25k! muh 30k! muh 50k!"  rekt

yikes, try less then 5%.  20% is extremely aggressive bordering on reckless
@_date: 2018-11-27 15:27:20
why do you think OTC market is somehow completely divorced from everything?  Still supply vs demand at work and there's arbitration forces that keep everything in line (aka why buy for a 20% premium in OTC when you can go on an exchange and clear out the orderbook with a market executed buy that'll give you a better price even with the slippage you'll cause by doing so...)
@_date: 2018-11-21 14:43:51
yeah seems people still haven't embraced this simple rule.  If you'd be anything more then a little bit salty that btc went to 0 then you have too fucking much invested in it.

Compared to the claim that everyone was exchanging btc at 15k+, yeah it's not that much lmao
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:37:15
they still impact the exchanges, if you have to pay 15% more OTC then on exchanges then the big money that normally would buy OTC will go market buy the exchanges for the better price even with the slippage that'll cause.
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:30:04

@_date: 2018-11-25 03:19:07
it's a speculative asset, and the exchanges make money on the degenerate gamblers maxxing out leverage and going all in then getting rekt cause they know fuck all about price action and trading it

yeh ofc I'm just saying I am not really seeing any of that rn, all the delusion is firmly on the bear side with some ridiculous price targets just like the delusion was firmly on the bull side before

@_date: 2018-11-15 21:55:13

@_date: 2018-11-24 18:00:58
nah that 5.8 dive back in the early days of this bear was quite obviously a capitulation.  Problem is bear markets often have multiple events before finishing.

yeah it was a scam back when it was like $100, we (filthy nocoiners) all saw it as magic internet money that was literally nonexistent and shouldn't even be worth 5 cents.  It going to 20K rattled everyone's cages because they realized how much money they missed out on for not taking it seriously.  They won't be making that mistake again.

@_date: 2018-11-21 14:50:48
lots of people predicted these prices man, lol didn't take a rocket scientist to identify the major levels of support created on the way up and do a basic fib retrace pull to find the 786 which btc has reverted back to on every significant macro pullback in it's life.

@_date: 2018-11-21 15:14:23
nah didn't know 20k was the top (although there was HUGE RSI div on high timeframes between the first peak and the ultimate ~19k top) but you could pretty clearly see the supply distribution following it and the parabola break was also a thing...
Seem to always get salty/angry people replying to this kinda post.  I promise it's not rocket science to ID strong support/resistance levels, there's no need to be upset.

They are diverting hashpower from btc to try and win the war.  Also selling btc to cover the crazy costs of the war.
ICO's could be capitulating/preparing for SEC and scammed investors coming after them.

You don't know my story, and a half blind monkey could've pointed out this level in the technicals.  It's not a falling knife at significant levels, your odds are good of at minimum getting a bounce and being able to set a defensive stop in case you're wrong and likely catching the bottom and maxing out gains.  Can't be a scared money pussy though, helps when you're properly allocating capital and only kicking it off with a starter position that you add to once reversal is confirmed and a new trend emerges.
Nailed every one of those tops in the structure btc just broke out of and the base of it was the 70.5 fib off the '14 lows and a orderblock/support level previously established.  786 is tucked in this orderblock we've stopped at and is a retrace level that btc has visited/accumulated around and bounced away from every single macro pullback in it's history.

nah lol I've seen so many 10 mil market buy/sell roll through over the months, never has one moved the price anywhere fucking near $200 let alone $400.  And keep in mind the %'s are a lot bigger down here.
Price found support on the 200MA weekly and is now moving off of it.  Wouldn't be so quick to assume it's a little trap that'll get rekt immediately.  
Also you seem a bit overly bear biased so lemme give ya a hint:  People are legitimately buying down here, we're in teh wheelhouse of the bottom going off all previous macro retraces in BTC history.  You're acting like the only way buying could exist is through shorts closing or it being a trap.

@_date: 2018-12-11 17:42:01


lol no he's not, most people didn't even know crypto existed by the time it was in the last month of the parabolic runup, and it took weeks to get money onto coinbase and buy at that point.
VPVR shows that the vast majority of btc changed hands in the 6-7k price range.  Very little changed hands in the top part of the runup.
And also the amount of fiat in crypto even at the top was tiny compared to other markets.  There are a metric fuck ton of greater fools still around, only this time they will have known about crypto beforehand and will have watched it moon form the sidelines before.
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:23:07

@_date: 2018-12-02 17:11:53
You just display a basic lack of understanding of market cycles and market psychology.  
Really don't feel like wasting time running thorugh each of your points, but main one that sticks out is the idea that massive amounts of normies got burned for large amounts... there was very little actual money put into crypto especially up around the peak.  There are a metric fuck ton of normies out there who still haven't even heard of crypto/btc, let alone know about and let alone actually put any money into it.  And this all is ignoring the fact that normies don't move markets anyway.
Also nothing fundamentally drove this bubble or it's decline from the high, "macro drivers" as you put it.  Nothing's changed except the price.
Mass media can pump it right back up again but it'll be even more effective this time around.

This is likely only the smaller mining outfits, since the big ones can handle operating at a loss for awhile and so avoid the risk exposure of shorting the market.
This strategy will stop working when the market turns around and either will bankrupt the small outfits via short liquidation or the mining will become profitable again.
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:25:16

@_date: 2018-12-17 14:21:37
They absolutely would/could be selling, that's how they control price and accumulate.  
The key point though is that they are net long while doing it (if accumulating, will be net short if distributing).  Sell price down and accumulate until slippage brings price back up, sell it back down, etc.  Big money isn't just going one direction most of the time they are working ranges/pushing price toward a desired range/etc

risk allocation broseph.  You have a set amount of capital allocated to different areas of investment and you stick to it.  That's how you avoid getting rekt by any one investment.
The bulltard has undoubtedly spent all of his already and is sitting with cawk in hand, whereas the realist has been bearish and so still has available space in the portfolio.

I think it's more of a pre-buy signal.  They are fudding cause their price targets haven't been met yet.
Although I guess they could also be doing it to try and keep buyers away and enough sellers dumping so they have a easier time accumulating without price slippage.

"It's pumped too much now, can't buy back in cause it'll dump soon"

you can be bearish in a bear market and not sell near the bottom.  Or put another way, refrain from being a bull-tard in a bear market.  That would've saved you from spending all your money up above 6k, for instance.
