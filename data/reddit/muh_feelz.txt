Look at the bitcoin markets though.  They're 90% red.  You know what that means?  It means that they lost relative to bitcoin.  So actually BTC took one of the smallest hits today.  Feels good :)

Hell no it's not a bad thing but it's been there for a week.  I'm just saying we could see this dip back to 16.5 in 30 minutes.  This is not a significant event.

Very true.  But if appears it's one of if not the best "store of value" in all of crypto.
Also just funny to me that a lot of people are taking such pleasure in watching BTC drop, when their own investments are taking an even bigger hit.  Talk about cutting off your nose to spite your face!

Damn people suck. :(

Can't get past that sell wall at 17800.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:02:47
Yeah, about 65 coins at 17800.  It chewed up quite a few and then fell back.  That's the second time it's done that today.  If it can get past that there doesn't appear to be much resistance until 18k.

Nobody said you were joking.  You're just wrong :)

Not sure how much clearer I can make it.  If you look at the Bitcoin markets (as opposed to USD or ETH) you'll see that most coins are red.  That is in relation to BTC.  See link below to Bittrex in which you can see the BTC, ETH, and USD markets to see how coins are fairing relative to BTC, ETH, and USD.

Geez guys.  It's been over 17k multiple times in the past week.  Let's chill a bit before calling a moon shot.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:53:24
Makes no sense.  It already "crashed" to 15k after hitting 19-20 the other day.  I think it's regrouping for another run.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:40:23
Yeah, feels good that my investment didn't lose as much as many others.  You're an idiot if you don't think that people care about their money above all else
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:07:13
Where did I celebrate it?
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:47:29


FUD.  The ATH was 2 weeks ago.  Calm your tits.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:50:23
LTC and ETH had larger gains than that in the 2nd week of Dec.  I guess they're also jokes?
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:00:07
We have no idea if that will happen.  It's still behaving in a fairly healthy manner.  It had a meteoric rise which was bad, and was at risk of a crash then, but instead it corrected 25% and is staying stable.  No reason to expect a crash at this time.  NOW, if it goes up 300% in a matter of days like LTC just did, then we might see a massive sell-off much like the "run on the banks" in 1929.

Still liking 2k?
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:07:42
Still fairly yeah. Why wouldn't I be. Fairly good support at 9k
