You are misunderstanding how limit orders work.
Your statement "So in the scenario where the price goes below 15000, you would have made a sell limit order at 14500, which, if below market, wouldn't even post." is wrong.
It wouldn't post on the order book. It would get executed immediately if the current price is above 14500 - and it would get executed at that current price. Oh and it would be a taker order and incur a fee.

It's the same freaking exchange! Yesterday they attached a 130 sat/byte fee to the transaction. Today they attached a 13,000 sat/byte fee.
If they want it, absolutely, in the next bloc, a 500 sat/byte fee would suffice. They went 25 times that.

I am aware of exactly 1 exchange that has 0% maker fees. Are there any others?
And if Robinhood routs all their orders to GDAX, that wouldn't be finding the lowest-priced exchange, would it?
And, by the way, I do that when I need a quick buy or sell (set very close to market but not market price orders) and quite often they take minutes if not hours to fill. I wonder if on Robinhood, someone will be willing to wait minutes or hours for his market order to fill.
Another interesting concept - they only will do crypto/fiat trades, right? Specifically, crypto/USD. So that leaves the huge majority of exchanges out of the loop. Just a few left, really. And who is going to clear USD for them? Right now there is no such mechanism.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:23:12
The difference between stocks and crypto is that for stocks, there is usually (always?) just one exchange. So when you look at MSFT on TD Ameritrade platform or on E*Trade, you see the same price, because it comes from the same exchange.
Crypto trading has many exchanges.
But how the price is set on the exchange is similar with stocks and crypto. Bids and asks. Supply and demand.

In a fast moving market, placing orders with GDAX's web interface can be very awkward. While you're typing in your limit price, it has already moved, leaving you behind. To modify the order, you have to cancel it and re-enter a new one.
In general, trading with GDAX's web interface is amateurish. Instead, use professional-grade trading software like [Medved Trader]( For example, to make sure you place an optimal sell limit order in a fast moving market, you just set up a trading ticket (or a visual trading capsule on a chart) to be a limit that is Pegged to Bid (or Bid minus a small offset). Then your unsent order's limit price, in real time, tracks the Bid and when you send the order you send it at Bid (or Bid minus a small offset) to make sure that it is placed on the book.
Or, to modify a pending order, in Medved Trader you can just drag the order capsule on the chart to a new price. A lot easier, faster and more convenient than the GDAX's way.
For now, [Medved Trader]( connects to GDAX and Binance for market data and trading. More exchanges' integration is coming soon.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:37:23
[Explanation of GDAX order types](
* Stop: Sell - If the current trade price drops to the Stop Price or below, the "Stop" is triggered and the order becomes a market sell order (see Market Sell above), and is a taker.
* Stop Limit: Sell - like a Stop Sell, but when triggered, it becomes a Limit Sell at the specified Limit Price (See Limit Sell above). Can be a maker or a taker depending on if the limit price is above the Bid price when triggered.
So - when the trade price dropped to 14,500, your order converted to a limit sell order at 14,000. Since the price was around 14,500 your order executed immediately, and was a maker order. thus incurring fees.
Here is what you wanted "but if it starts to drop and it reaches 14500, place a LIMIT order of 14000 to minimize my losses.". But think - a limit sell order of 14000 says "sell at any price 14000 and above". 
What you wanted was a kind of a stop-stop order. As in - if 14500 is reached, place a stop order at 14000. But then that's just a stop order at 14000. Why the 14500 step?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:50:32
Stop Sell at 13000
(or if you want to try to be a maker and not incur fees, you could try Stop Limit with Stop at 13000 and Limit at 13001)

No, it's not normal.
GDAX charts regularly glitch. Current glitching is not because data is lost. It is because their servers are horribly overloaded and some data requests get blocked by rate limits, resulting in gaps in data.
I am sure they are working on upgrading the servers.
In general GDAX's Web UI charting is subpar. Limited timeframes, limited backscroll, very few indicators etc. Trading is awkward and modifying pending orders is pathetic.
Use professional software to trade on GDAX - Medved Trader - connects to GDAX (and Binance and some other exchanges) and gives you superior charting, monitoring/trading on multiple exchanges at same time, DOM, visual trading from charts, scanning, alerts etc. 
For example, MT records all quotes it receives locally, so if you switch charts and come back, it will use the stored charts and augment them with backfilled data, so even if the backfill glitches (like currently with GDAX API) the stored data is still there.

If current Ask price is 1000 and you send a buy Limit order at 1000 or higher, it will not be placed on the book, will be executed immediately, will be a "taker" order, and will incur fees.
If you send this same order as a "post only" order, it will be rejected.
If current Ask price is 1000 and you send a buy Limit order at 999.99 or lower, it will be placed on the book, will be a "maker" order, and will not incur fees when/if executed.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:10:37
to do that, you would place a BUY STOP  or STOP LIMIT order with the stop price of 20K, and that will not show on the book.  
if it is a buy STOP order, when the price reaches 20K it will become a market order and immediately execute, and all of us will thank you. 
If it is a LIMIT order, then it will either post to the book at that point or if the limit price is above the ask, execute immediately

I don't remember from last time I sent anything from GDAX, but I think there should be a link somewhere in the "pending" transaction that will show you what the transaction key is, and probably the current status (that is, how many confirmations etc).
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:05:28
Sure, you can - but not for the whole amount. Your account on GDAX is not a margin account. So when you place an order, (let's say "sell 2 BTC"), the 2 BTC is placed on hold and you cannot use it in another order.
So - if you have 10 BTC, you can place a limit sell on 5 BTC and a stop loss on 5 BTC. Or 7 and 3.

if you first sell, then place the buy order after that, sure. Otherwise, the system won't let you because it will think you have no funds. If the SELL didn't execute yet, you wouldn't be able to place the buy order, even at a lower price.
You could do this if your account allowed trading on margin. AFAIU, GDAX doesn't have margin trading anymore.

Well yes - daytraders don't use brokerages' web user interfaces, ever. They use programs like [Medved Trader]( - in fact, it is a daytrading program for stocks, futures and Forex that connects to a lot of different conventional brokers. 
Because crypto trading is such a young industry, there is very little professional commercial software developed for it yet, mostly some proprietary stuff written by some traders themselves.
Since crypto trading is like forex, we connected it to GDAX and Binance as well. There are some idiosyncrasies with crypto vs Forex, but we take care of these differences.
Web interfaces are extremely limited. You have one chart, you have a couple of indicators only, your timeframes on charts are very limited, placing orders is awkward, there is no scanning or alerts etc.

Neither is my company, but that "AML/KYC/OFAC documentation" is a requirement on the applications, so gotta submit *something*. What exactly did you submit?
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:35:47
You're saying "manupulation" like it's a bad thing.
What you call "manipulation" some would call "trading". There are some regulations on regular markets (like stock-) that don't exist for crypto markets, but other than that, anyone who wants to sell big will depress the price, and if that creates a downward momentum that he can ride to buy lower - that's just the market.
Same on the up side. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:38:53
Yes - if your order is a "taker" order. Market orders are always "takers". So are Stop orders. Stop Limit can be either depending on the limit you set.

[Medved Trader]( &lt;- which, by coincidence :) supports both GDAX and Binance.

That cannot be accomplished by any of the current GDAX order types.
Stop Sell orders will trigger immediately if the Stop price is above current price.
What you're describing is a modified trailing stop order. Not supported by GDAX.

@_date: 2017-12-25 18:56:23
Go to your accounts on GDAX. Go to BTC account. Click on "Transfers" in the upper right corner. Click on that particular transfer. 
Do you see only transfer ID and not the transaction hash? That's because GDAX is sitting on your transaction and has not sent it to the BTC network to be processed.
I have no idea why they're doing that. There is no reason whatsoever for it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:21:58
Medved Trader uses GDAX API - so does the GDAX's front end. In that respect, the speed is the same. Web UI is inherently clunkier and slower than the equivalent native PC code. 
As for security - well, for one thing we have been in this business since 1998 (here's a [Barron's article]( about us) and work with numerous regular brokerages. They trust us. 
Second, for trading you provide your API key (for data, you don't provide anything, it's publicly available). When creating the API key, you can specify what can be done with it. See the [MT-GDAX connection instructions](
You can even restrict it to a whitelist of IPs. Well, you *could* if that feature of GDAX API didn't have a bug in it. But if it worked, you could :)
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:37:00
If you don't see the hash, but only transfer id, that means GDAX is sitting on the transaction (it has been sitting on mine for like 2 hours now) WITHOUT placing it in mempool.
(Go to Accounts, BTC Account, click on "Transfers" in upper right - then click on that particular withdrawal. If the transaction has is there it would say something like:
**BTC transaction hash: &lt;some long string of hex numbers and letters&gt;**)
They will, eventually, put it in the mempool and generate the hash, so don't worry about it.
I have NO idea why sometimes GDAX places these into mempool practically instantly, while at other times they wait and wait to be placed. It's not like they are waiting to combine some transactions together - they never do that. 
If someone has any idea why GDAX just sits on these once in a while - do share.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:58:45
It's gone now but look at the pic. See how the values on left and right match, approximately. The 1K or so BTC on the right would be matched by 1K or so BTC on the left, and the price would drop to the level on the left. That's of course if, as I said, it was executed at market.

First, a warning: successful day trading cryptos is not easy. Especially for people with no experience in day trading in general.
That said, for daytrading you need a high-liquidity platform and low fees. 
For BTC, LTC and ETH that's GDAX, hands down. For alt coins there are a few. Binance and Bittrex come to mind.
Check out [Medved Trader]( - professional PC desktop trading software. It connects to Binance and GDAX to pull data and trade. In addition to customizable alerts (which is probably what you're looking for) it has superior charting/tech. indicators and annotation, ability to modify orders by just dragging them on the chart or on DOM, scanning etc.
It is free to try. [Download/install it](

Yes, [Medved Trader]( is an advanced trading platform, but we do not currently do automated trading for a number of reasons:
1) Liability
2) have not had a chance to write a proper risk management system
3) have not had a chance yet to write the UI needed for this

You're quite a bit off. Especially for "cease buying". That really is not how it works.
[Here's an explanation of GDAX order types](
If you don't understand something in there, don't hesitate to ask. I would hate for someone to be using GDAX orders without full understanding of what they are. That's a recipe for disaster.

Every few times I transfer out of GDAX I look at the fees.
It was around 100 sat/byte a couple months ago. A month ago it was around 350. My last transaction was 953 sat/byte
That's high. That also means they pay something like $30/transaction for me. I calculated what they get from me in trading fees, and they do make a profit. But it is not huge.

Here is another one:

As for "I'm really having a hard time finding a good use case for stop-limit orders" - they exist so that the order is still a maker and you avoid fees. A stop sell order is always a taker, and incurs a 0.25% fee. A stop limit sell order, if the limit is sufficiently above the stop, is a maker order, incurring 0% fee on GDAX BUT you run the risk of the price of the price continuing to drop and your order not executing.
Another reason for stop limit orders is a flash crash protection. Which is what your order was. It said - if the price crashes to 14500, sell for at least 14000. Do not sell if the price immediately crashes to below 14000.
Check out the ETH flash crash. People who placed stop losses were wiped out. The stop limit order like that would have protected you from being completely wiped out
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:25:46
Being discussed [here](
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:44:31
There is major friction involved. As in - there are huge delays currently transferring BTC and ETH, and there always have been difficulties transferring fiat quickly. And once you start moving big USD sums around you will attract attention from authorities. You really don't want that.
The more friction, the harder/less profitable it is to arbitrage. The harder/less profitable it is to arbitrage, the more disparities are allowed to exist without being smoothed out.
You know how you can know that this is because of fiat friction? Check the crypto/crypto pair prices between exchanges. The differences are minuscule. Because if they were big, then arbitrage would be hugely profitable, since the friction is MUCH less.
It is really not rocket science. There is no free lunch. If you think this is an easy arbitrage opportunity, you're welcome to try. You'll find out it is not.
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:58:06
They are not batching. It is easy to see - just look at your transaction hash in tx browser. How many transactions do you see batched in one?
Binance, for example, batches like crazy. Sometimes I see close to 100 transactions together.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:57:22
In order to do this, half your funds have to be in some kind of crypto currency, and half in USD. "Institutional" investors eschew this kind of volatile investments.
And this was already discussed here: 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:31:04
So you buy 1 BTC on GDAX for 19,600. Then you send it to QuadrigaCX and maybe sell it for 20,600 ("maybe" because the sending of it takes 20 min to several hours, and during that time it could have tanked to 18,000 on QuadrigaCX, right?). 
So, after taking that risk, and paying Quadriga $103 for the privilege, you're up $900. What do you do with that $ now? How do you get it back to GDAX fast to repeat the trade? Because arbitrage is not supposed to be a one-time thing. I see constant complaints here that GDAX wire transfers take 3-4 days :)
It's also supposed to be a sure thing, and the way I described it above it isn't. To make it a sure thing you need a simultaneous buy on one exchange and sell on the other. But that doubles the required capital, halving the profit percentage.
And I have a feeling that if you start wiring $20K at a time around every few days you will attract some attention of the authorities.

[Medved Trader]( is a trading /charting platform like Think or Swim (in fact, it can connect to TD Ameritrade as well) and works great for Crypto Currencies. 
It can connect to GDAX, Binance, Poloniex and others. If GDAX is blocked, that might be a problem - though could be that their API servers are not blocked, in which case MT would still work. Or you could select one of the other crypto sites for quotes (none of the crypto sites require login). Worst case, you could actually have Medved Trader get the data from Yahoo
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:44:20
GDAX charts regularly glitch. Current glitching is not because data is lost. It is because their servers are horribly overloaded and some data requests get blocked by rate limits, resulting in gaps in data.
I am sure they are working on upgrading the servers.
In general GDAX's Web UI charting is subpar. Limited timeframes, limited backscroll, very few indicators etc. Trading is awkward and modifying pending orders is pathetic.
Use professional software to trade on GDAX - [Medved Trader]( - connects to GDAX (and Binance and some other exchanges) and gives you superior charting, monitoring/trading on multiple exchanges at same time, DOM, visual trading from charts, scanning, alerts etc. (If you use it, heads up - our symbol format is the same regardless of which site you use for quotes in Medved Trader, like this:

[Explanation of GDAX order types](
What you're describing places a "marketable" sell limit order - that is, a sell limit order that is below current price and executes immediately without being placed on the book. That is why you're being hit with fees.
If you don't want to be hit with fees, set stop of 15210 and limit of 15220. 
You want to be guaranteed execution and not be hit with a fee. That's not how it works.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:42:45
In order to save on fees GDAX batches up the withdrawals. If 10 people request to withdraw BTC at roughly the same time, it is recorded as one transaction, with one input (from GDAX's wallet) and 10 outputs. And one fee.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:03:55
Yes, and that is what happened in the infamous ETH flash crash on Jun 22, 2017.
TANSTAAFL. In order for you to sell at a reasonable price, there has to be a buyer at a reasonable price. 
If there isn't, and you placed a market order (which is what the stop is converted into when the price dips to or below your stop price), which is a "sell at any price" order, then it is sold at ANY price (well, at the best bid price at the moment), no matter how unreasonable it may be.
Set a Stop Limit in order to say "Sell when reaching this price, but at not less than this price". Then you have the risk of your sell order not executing. As I said, TANSTAAFL.

If you want to sell right away, you sell at market price and match the best price at which someone is willing to buy. 0.25% fee is minuscule compared to the $4000 gain you're enjoying. 
Or you can try to set a limit at $19000.1 - you have no guarantee that this order will execute, maybe 19000 will be the absolute top and it's all down from there :)
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:10:58
GDAX does pay your fee. I wish they batched - that would definitely save them money. They don't batch.
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:18:54
I should have said "best ask" - it is actually the bottom ask. Was thinking of the standard L2 display where it is shown at top.
The order book is a list of orders. Limit buy orders (those are called bids) and limit sell orders (those are called asks). On the depth table on GDAX, the bids are on the bottom, asks are on the top. 
So, out of all the asks (or people willing to sell), there is the best ask - the lowest price sell order. If you submit a market buy, THAT's the order with which you will be matched first. If your quantity is higher than that order, it will be completely bought by you and you will be matched against the next higher order.
If you submit a limit buy order with the price that is the same as the best ask price, you are matched with that order immediately - the action is equivalent to you submitting a market order. With the fees that apply to the market orders.
You have to understand how this works in order to trade. It's Trading 101, first day in class. If everyone submits limit orders only, the price will not move. Bids will sit on one side, asks on the other. Nothing will happen. It's the market orders that actually move the market.
Maybe I should add this to my [order type explanation page](

For full-fledged trading software that works with GDAX (and Binance, other exchanges are coming) try [Medved Trader](
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:36:35
This is how it works. First - sometimes GDAX lags in submitting the transaction to mempool. Anywhere from a few seconds to hours.
Second, once the transaction is in the mempool, the next block needs to be mined. Sometimes it is very fast. Sometimes (I saw that happen a few days ago) there was 1+ hours between blocks.
Since GDAX pays pretty good fees, there is a good chance that the transaction will be placed in the next mined block. If there is huge congestion, it may take a couple of blocks. So that's another 20-40 min.
Once it is in the block, a few blocks need to be mined and placed on the blockchain to "confirm" your transaction. Depending on the destination, it may take from 2 to 6 confirmations for the transaction to be completed. On Binance, for BTC it is confirmed after 2, so it's faster than others.
But that's another 30 min to 2 hours.
A few days ago a BTC transfer from GDAX took me 9.5 hours. 8.5 hours of that was waiting for GDAX to place the transaction into mempool.
Then the next day it took 24 minutes, and the mempool placement was practically instantaneous.
[Medved Trader](
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:35:44
ACH is limited at GDAX. Wire isn't. Wire is more hassle, some people have to actually visit their bank to do it, I (at BofA) have to do it through a fairly convoluted web page on the bank's web site. My wire to Gemini went through within 1.5 hrs. I understand that GDAX's processing of wires takes days (3-4) though.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:03:29
How exactly would it do that? The deposit transaction is initiated completely outside GDAX, GDAX has no idea about it until at least one confirmation, at which point the fees have already been paid.
I guess it could refund you the fees somehow. But that would be a bit... too generous.
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:53:21
If you look at the book - on the left under the big ORDER BOOK header - there is a middle line that says something like "USD Spread". Everything above this line is sell orders (asks). Everything below - buy orders (bids). The best price at which someone is willing to buy is the price right below that middle line.
As for your other question - as I said, there is no guarantee whatsoever that after the price reaches 19,000 and you place that 19,000.1 order, your order will be matched and executed. Maybe your stop price managed to guess the exact top of the market and the price will never go to 19,000.1. 
TANSTAAFL principle. You can save on the fees, and protect yourself from the market slippage but at the price of non-guaranteed order execution. Or you can pay the fees and run the risk of slippage, but be guaranteed market execution.

Eventually the matching engine shut down and right now no orders are coming through. But the book is still there and the API is working, just nothing is moving because the engine is shut down.
Kinda weird to watch, because there is no matching, so the book is just building higher and higher on both sides.

The ratio of limit buys/sells to market buys/sells is exactly 1:1. Every sale involves a taker on one side (market order) and a maker on the other (limit order).

There is, kinda. You can set a sell stop limit order. If the price is 12,800 you can set sell stop limit with a stop of 12,500 and a limit of 12,501.
Of course if the trade prices blow through 12,500 and go down without ever reaching back to 12,501, your order will not execute.

GDAX charts are pretty primitive. You can't specify arbitrary candle frequencies, you can't scroll back, you only have line and candle types... Which is fine - they are not in trading software business, they are in running-the-exchange business.
There are third party programs that work with GDAX data that are much better ([Medved Trader]( is one). We are in the trading software business.

No, the limit must not always be above the stop. It does have to be above the stop on a sell stop limit order IF you want your order to be a maker order and not incur fees.
As for your second question - yes, that is what I am saying. If the price recovered to 14000 or above, your limit order would have triggered then. But not at 13000. 
People who placed stop loss orders got taken out at ridiculous levels (&lt;$1) losing $300 per coin on ETH during the flash crash. If their orders were stop limit (let's say stop $250 limit $240), then the limit 240 sell would have been placed and not executed when the price crashed down to sub-$1. Only when/if it recovered back to $240.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:37:50
$280 on a $12500 is 2.2%. To arbitrage, you have to place a sell on one exchange and a buy on the other - that's 0.5% fee. So you have $220 left.  Note that the capital required to do that $220 is not $12500 but the equivalent of $25K, since you have to have $12.5K on both exchanges. So your return is $220 on $25K capital - less than 1%. To return to status quo ante, you'd have to pay fees to transfer BTC and to transfer fiat, so the percentage goes down even further. And sometimes it takes days (especially with GDAX) to transfer fiat. And you have to have the $ sit dead on one of the exchanges, waiting for the arbitrage opportunity. And if you constantly wire big sums of $ around, you fall under increased scrutiny of the authorities.
I mean, yes, I am sure some people do that. Personally, I wouldn't. Not worth the hassle.

"Post only" means that if the limit order you're placing is going to execute immediately (that is, if there is an immediate match in the book for the limit price you're putting in) the order will be rejected.
If it's not immediately matched, it is placed in the book and becomes a standard "maker" limit order.
If the current market is 7237 and you want to sell at 7450, checking the "post only" will do nothing. Your limit order will be placed on the book whether you check it or not.
But if the current market is 7237 and you want to sell it at 7237.5, and you want to pay no fees, then in the fraction of a second between the time you hit the button and the time the exchange receives your order the price may move up and your limit order will be matched immediately, and you'll be charged the "taker" fee. The "post only" option is to prevent that - in the case above your "post only" order would be rejected rather than be executed as a "taker".
There is another way to do this by using third-party software. Here's something you can do in Medved Trader ( on GDAX that is very useful, for example. For a buy - set up a trade ticket and set the buy limit price to be not absolute, but pegged to ask minus a small offset. The pegged price would fluctuate as the streaming quotes from GDAX come in. When you hit the execute button, the order is placed at the current ask - offset, most likely being placed on the book, thus making it a "maker" order and saving you the fees when it executes. Very useful in fast moving markets.
Or of course you could peg it to ask or to ask+offset if you want to buy immediately but don't want to use a market order in case your order is fairly big and there is no depth to the book.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:15:45
This is a stop market sell order. The way it works is when some trade goes through (that is, when the price reaches) your stop price, your order is now a market order. Which means it may, in extreme cases (when the book on bid is very thin), execute way below the stop price.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:48:20
That is an interesting question, actually. I am not sure why ALL crypto exchanges charge a percentage of the trade (which can be pretty substantial) vs. a flat fee like a lot of stock brokerages do.
Could be an "everyone else does it, so we can get away with it" kind of thing. Or could be because there are so many people who buy tiny amounts of bitcoin. No one in the stock market would buy 10 shares of a $2 stock. But you see people talking about $20-worth purchases of coins all the time.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:41:52
$25 vs what - $7 for BTC, $0.5 for ETH? Also, double it since it has to be exchange -&gt; bank -&gt; another exchange. That will really eat into your profit. Also, arbitrage gives you small % on each trade. 0.5% if you're lucky, usually less. If you have to wait 2 to 3 days for each play...

There are arguments for daytrading and for buy-and-hold. These arguments apply to Bitcoin and other crypto currencies just as they apply to stocks or futures or other Forex. 
One thing is definite - you cannot just jump into daytrading and expect to succeed. And especially if you're using exchange web interfaces to daytrade.
No serious stocks daytrader ever trades using a brokerage's web site. There is specialized professional software with the features daytrading requires.
For trading crypto currencies such software is currently not as available. Medved Trader ( is working on connecting various crypto exchanges to its software for portfolio monitoring, charting, alerts, scans and trading.

Due to how Bitcoin works, you can't really "own" it fully and trade it at the same time with any kind of speed. When transfers of ownership of Bitcoin take anywhere from 20 min to hours, "trading" it is impossible.
The exchanges allow you to trade by holding Bitcoin themselves and changing ownership rights, internally on the exchange, as you and others trade. None of the trades you post on Coinbase (or any other exchange) go on the blockchain. It would take forever and the blockchain could not possibly handle even a tiny fraction of this kind of volume.
A loose comparative case in the stock market would be paper stock certificates. You can buy stock by using a brokerage, then get the stock certificates and store them in your home or in a bank vault. That would be "owning" the stocks and equivalent to you transferring Bitcoin to your own paper- or hardware- wallet. Otherwise, the broker owns them and assigns them to you.

It's called "spoofing" - placing large order than you never intend to be executed to influence the perception of the market.
Such activity is forbidden by US law (Dodd Frank) in other markets. Crypto exchanges are a bit of a Wild West right now so Dodd Frank does not apply, especially to the foreign ones.
From my experience watching the markets, "walls" rarely mean anything unless they are really close to the current market price.

Trading crypto markets today is pretty weird. People trade using Web interfaces of the exchanges, using mostly market orders (because in fast moving markets, manually entering limit orders that are close to current trade price is basically impossible), there is a lack of professional software yet that connects to crypto markets and the exchanges are so fragmented.
We at [Medved Trader]( are trying to rectify the situation. We connected our PC trading software to GDAX, the Binance integration is coming very soon, and other exchanges that have APIs that are not as crappy as Gemini's will be integrated after that.
Face it, trading using the web interfaces is trading blind. Any serious trader either uses trading software like [Medved Trader]( or writes his own (and few have the skills to write their own really).

Transfers of US Dollars into and out of exchanges use the current US banking system (ACH or wire) which is pretty slow, and, in case of GDAX, wires take days. One reason BTC's future is so bright is that it provides a method of moving funds around that is not dependent on the dinosaur banking system and is much faster (except of course during glitches like the transaction stuffing attack :)).
Once your USD amount shows up in your account and is cleared, you can immediately use it to buy crypto.

In other, non-crypto, markets, "exchange" is a place that has the matching engine, can accept buy/sell orders and conduct the transactions/trades. Like NASDAQ. Or NYSE.
"Broker" is a middleman between you and the "exchange". In other markets, only very big players (if at all) can trade directly on the exchange. Others have to go through the middlemen-brokers who add value by bells and whistles and order execution facilitation on multiple exchanges. Broker examples: TD Ameritrade, E*Trade, Gain Capital. Sometimes there is another layer of "introducing brokers" who are a middleman between the trader and a big broker, adding some value. Example: Optimus Futures is an "introducing broker" for Gain Capital and Rithmic brokerages.
"Trading platform" in non-crypto-world usually refers to software that connects to the broker (or, rarely, to the exchange itself) and has the features that facilitate watching the market, trading, and making trading decisions.
Since crypto markets were kinda organically grown and not originally created by professionals (AFAIU), the terminology got jumbled up. There are some other weird peculiarities (such as the penchant for reporting 24-hour rolling volume and change, which is basically useless).

This is "spoofing". It is defined as "bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution, submitting or cancelling bids and offers to overload the quotation system of a marketplace; or to submit multiple bids or offers to create the appearance of false market depth."
It is considered a disruptive trading practice and unlawful under Section 4c(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act.
AFAIU, that law does not apply to crypto exchanges.

"Market" buy order means: buy everything that is currently offered at best (lowest) price until the order quantity is reached. Since it executes right away and removes orders from the book, this would be a "taker".
"Limit" buy order means: buy at X price or lower, until the order quantity is reached. If there is something currently offered at X price or lower, the execution is immediate and this is a "taker" order. If there is nothing currently offered at X price or lower, the limit order is placed on the book and this becomes a "maker" order.
Of course, it is an inverse for sell orders.
Here's something you can do in Medved Trader ( on GDAX that is very useful, for example. Set up a trade ticket and set the buy limit price to be not absolute, but pegged to ask minus a small offset.

Don't bother - unless you learn programming you won't be able to utilize the API to do it that way. 
You're talking about placing an OCO order - 2 legged order where "one cancels other". GDAX (and other crypto exchanges) does not have these. 
If you have an exchange that allows margin (GDAX is very limited in that respect) you could just place the two limit orders as long as they both were within the margin and manually cancel one if the other executes.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:03:29
That's optimistic. I am looking at the exchanges right now and you're lucky if you can find (between reasonably liquid exchanges) a $70 difference in BTCUSD. Granted, during high volatility periods (like a couple of days ago) it was $200+. But - such opportunities are few and far between.
On edit: right now the diff between Binance and GDAX is about $200. A bit crazy. Don't know how long that will last.
On edit again: :) Binance is problematic since it is not USD. It is USDT. Can't transfer that. Have to convert to something else then transfer it, which is where you would lose all your profit. TANSTAAFL.
For example: let's say you use ETH as the transfer mechanism for your USDT. The difference between ETHUSDT on Binance and ETHUSD in let's say GDAX is right now about 4% (!!). Which is about the same as the difference is between Binance and GDAX's BTCUSD - 4%. So the profit you would make on BTCUSD arbitrage you would lose on transferring your USDT out.

You don't have to have econ background for this, you just have to have had some encounters with buying/selling any anything using financial markets - whether stocks, futures, forex or crypto currencies. It is similar (cryptos do have some peculiarities, but not enough to really matter).
You have to understand that it is not a store. When you're buying, you're buying from another person, like you (ignore the "bot" thing for now) who decides to sell.
1. As was explained, the "risk" of not being filled is if you place a limit order. A limit buy order says "but at price X, if available". If you place that order and there is no one on the exchange willing to sell you at that price, your order is not going to be filled.
2. I don't see any advantage of using Coinbase. GDAX is the trading arm of Coinbase.
3. The graphs - the chart is a standard candlestick chart used in the trading industry since forever -  Though you can make it a line chart.
The roughly V-shaped graph is the representation of the order book. Let's say you're watching BTC/USD. Red is "bid" or "buy" orders - exchange clients saying "I want to buy N amount of BTC at X price in dollars". Green is "ask" or "sell" orders - exchange clients saying "I want to sell M amount of BTC at Y price in dollars". The line is cumulative - that is, each point represents the total amount of orders that is available for buying (or selling) at this price or above (or this price and below).
To expand on your (1) again: if you try to place a limit order that will go on the book by giving the price that is a small amount away from the top bid/ask, in the time it takes you to type in the "penny away" price, the price can easily move and make your order the "taker" order. Can very easily happen even in normal markets, much more so in fast moving markets like they are lately.
Here's something you can do if you're using Medved Trader ( to trade on GDAX that definitely helps with that. Set up a trade ticket and set the sell limit price to be not absolute, but pegged to bid plus a small offset (usually the offset should be about half the spread). The pegged price would fluctuate as the streaming quotes from GDAX come in. When you hit the execute button, the order is placed at the current bid + offset, most likely being placed on the book, thus making it a "maker" order and saving you the fees when it executes.

Midnight UTC. That's every exchange's convention for daily candles.
Every crypto exchange out there has the bizarre method of showing change and volume on a rolling 24-hr basis. That is, if they show change of -10, that's 10 less than the value 24 hours ago, not 10 less than at the beginning of a session. That's because they don't have a concept of "trading sessions". That makes the volume and change variables completely useless to a trader. If it is "-10" from 24 hours ago 5 minutes ago and "-5" now, that doesn't give you a sense of the movement of the price, because it may have gone up now because it has gone down in the same 5 minutes 24 hours ago. My only explanation for this weirdness is that the first exchanges were founded by amateurs who had no idea how these things are supposed to operate and the later-comers just copied it.
In our trading software ( for crypto exchanges we made a "247" timeframe that goes UTC0 to UTC0, 7 days a week, and jumped through hoops to set up sessions for those exchanges so that the change and volume you see in Medved Trader's portfolios and charts is from the UTC0 that day.
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:11:47
Let's clarify: deposits of US dollars into GDAX from a bank may take days to clear.
**Once they clear**, you can use them immediately to trade. Once you buy BTC if you sell it and get US dollars back, those are immediately available to trade.
What takes days is to get US dollars from outside of GDAX into GDAX.

Credit card fees are at least 1% usually more. On Coinbase it is 3.99% (!!!!). That's a huge fee.
You can wire the money into GDAX (or Gemini or whatever) and it will be there within hours. My bank charges $30 for a wire. So if you're transferring 10K (is that what "large-ish" is?) that's 0.3%. Reasonable.
You can also ACH-deposit up to $5000 a week into your GDAX account with no fees. But it will take 4 days for the money to show up in your GDAX account. You can ACH-deposit up to $500/day into a Gemini account, and it will show up in the account and be available for trading (but not for withdrawal) immediately.

the GDAX charts on their web interface is really good for just a glimpse at the market. For anything else you need to get much better charting. [Medved Trader]( integrates with GDAX and lets you see detailed charts for 10 days right of the bat (from GDAX), but can store data for 120 in 1 minute granularity. Extremely customizable, hundreds of studies/indicators available, and you can trade from the charts. It is a Windows program

Here's a problem with that approach: in the time it takes you to type in the "penny away" price, the price can easily move and make your order the "taker" order. Can very easily happen even in normal markets, much more so in fast moving markets like today. 
Here's something you can do in Medved Trader ( on GDAX that definitely helps with that. Set up a trade ticket and set the sell limit price to be not absolute, but pegged to bid plus a small offset (usually the offset should be about half the spread). The pegged price would fluctuate as the streaming quotes from GDAX come in. When you hit the execute button, the order is placed at the current bid + offset, most likely being placed on the book, thus making it a "maker" order and saving you the fees when it executes.

For some reason you're thinking that when you sell your BTC for USD on Coinbase, you're selling it to Coinbase itself.
You're really selling it to whoever is willing to buy. Coinbase may play a market maker role, but it is not obligated to do it. So if you're trying to sell but no one is willing to buy, your limit order will just sit there. 
If you place a market order, it will just sweep up all the pending buy orders on the book. 
If your order is large and the book on bid side is thin, you may tank the price significantly doing that.
This is Trading 101. It scares me when I see the new investors asking these questions. You gotta research a little bit before you enter the markets.

If you're doing this on GDAX - try using [Medved Trader]( for this. You'd be able to trade visually from charts or DOM directly. Probably more convenient than the GDAX's web interface.

Bitcoin, by its nature, is not for small transactions. You will never buy coffee or a Snickers bar with Bitcoin. Even if the transaction times go down to 10 minutes and the fees down to tiny amounts, you will still be hungry for an extra 10 minutes, and your coffee will get cold.
Back-of-the-napkin calculation: right now, miners gets 12.5BTC per block. At current price of BTC, that's $88K. There are what - around 2000 transactions in a block? Let's say that's another $14K in fees. So - total around $100K per block. Roughly.
In the future, when BTC is fully mature, there will be no mining reward for a block other than the fees. Let's stipulate that the $100K/block, roughly, is needed for mining. That means if the transactions stay at 2000/block, you would need to charge $50 per transaction.
In order to go down to $5/transaction, the block size will have to grow to 10M at least. 
And even at $5 it's too high for the Snickers bar, obviously. The whole structure of miners' voluntarily picking the transactions off the mempool to fill the blocks prevents the transaction fee pricing from being a percentage vs. an absolute. Since the transaction may be the same number of bytes for a $2 transaction vs. $2000 transaction, there is no incentive whatsoever for a miner to pick the $2 transaction if the fee is a percentage.
Apart from which, the sheer volume of transactions that need to be processed if Bitcoin becomes the medium of exchange for Snickers bars is something that the Bitcoin model cannot physically sustain.
So you need side-networks like Lightning. Hopefully that's coming soon and lives up to the hype.

You're mixing up crypto transactions and trading.
Transaction: when you send an amount of crypto currency from one address to another. This gets recorded in the blockchain and may take anywhere from 10 min for Ethereum to 40-50 min for Bitcoin (and longer if the network is congested).
Trade: the Bitcoin is not held by a person, it is held by the exchange on which you're trading. It is assigned to you on the exchange when you buy it, but it is not transferred (see above) to you. It is just an accounting change. It does not get recorded on the blockchain. Such trades (once the price matches) happen instantaneously. 
The reason for a buy LIMIT order not going through immediately has to do with the matching engine. A buy order only goes through if the engine can match it to a sell order that someone places. 
If your buy order is a market order (that is, "buy at any price right now"), it will match the lowest pending sell orders, taking them out, and execute immediately.
If your buy order is a limit order (that is, "buy at *this* price or lower"), it has to be matched with another limit or market sell order. If no such match occurs - that is, if no one on the exchange wants to sell it to you for that price - the order will sit on the book until it matches.
If I may suggest, with all respect - if the above was edifying for you, you're really not anywhere near ready to daytrade.

What, no one mentioned GDAX yet? :)
I did my verification for GDAX on the phone. The camera on the PC was apparently not sharp enough.
One more advantage for using GDAX - Medved Trader ( It connects to GDAX for bitcoin trading and to quite a few conventional brokers for stock/futures/forex trading to pull down the market data and use it for the trader's tools - charts, tech. indicators, scans, alerts, etc. Allows you to trade visually from charts or DOM.
Much more convenient than the clunky web interface.
We're working on connecting it to other crypto exchanges. It already works with Poloniex and Bitfinex for data, but not for trading. Gemini, Binance and HitBTC connections are in the works.
It doesn't cost anything to try - go to  register, download the software and run it.

It is very hard to do arbitrage on the BTCUSD pair. It is not feasible. For repeated arbitrage to work, you have to have fast and reasonably cheap fund transfers between exchanges. And by fast I mean not measured in days. 
For the BTCUSD pair, you would have to transfer USD (and BTC) between exchanges. For BTC it is reasonable. For USD it would take way too long and cost too much.

You would think cleaning dust would not involve 100+ sat/byte transactions where they were 2-3 sat/byte immediately prior. Seems a bit wasteful. At 100 sat/byte, and 196 transactions (like in one of the recent blocks) that comes to something like $50+ per transaction mining fee. A bit expensive for cleaning dust...

This is a very early stage for crypto markets. Eventually, like with FX, it will coalesce to just a few exchanges, which will be arbitraged so closely that there won't be any difference.

[Explanation of GDAX order types](
Your order, when 7400 was hit, converted to limit "sell at 7395" order. If, immediately after 7400 was hit, there were no bids to buy at 7395 or above, your order was not executed, and just stayed a limit order.
To make sure your stop loss order is taken, you have to make it a stop market order. As in "when price reaches 7400, sell at any price". But then you run the risk of it being executed much lower than 7400.

The only difference between charts on crypto exchanges and the regular FX or stock charts is that crypto exchanges eschew trading sessions and universally quote both current volume and change as a rolling 24-hour value instead of from beginning of the trading session. Which makes these values basically useless.
When we integrated these exchanges into our trading software (Medved Trader) we imposed UTC0 - based 24 hrs sessions on the charts to make it more comparable to standard FX.
GDAX, by the way, is now fully integrated, both for data and for trading, with DOM/L2, scans, charting, alerts, etc. in Medved Trader. You're welcome to try it -

Medved Trader is not a "bot". It does not do auto-trading. It is broker-neutral professional PC trading software that connects to a bunch of different brokers, for stock-, FX-, futures- and now (with GDAX) crypto- trading.
It gives you the tools - charts, tech analysis, scans, alerts, DOM etc - you still have to trade yourself.
In order to just run it without trading - just look at charts, DOM, alerts etc. - you can connect to GDAX without any login, since GDAX data API is public. It can also connect to Poloniex and Bitfinex for data (but not for trading, yet).
You do need to connect it to your GDAX account if you want to trade through the program - visually from charts or DOM or just by regular trade ticket.
