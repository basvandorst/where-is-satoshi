@_date: 2017-02-16 19:01:21
This can happen. What you can do is request the rawtransaction (either bitcoind or in this case blockchain.info )
But if you try to submit it (at an other node, for example block.io) i can happen that they haven't seen the previous transaction. (the utxo you are trying to spend).  But in this case your input is part of this address  which seems to be doing a lot of unconfirmed spends.
@_date: 2017-02-26 10:32:37
0.14 rc1 allows -walletrbf as startup command. And you can CPFP with createrawtransaction, there is just not a ui for it.
@_date: 2017-03-20 13:43:10
Every transaction not in a block is in mempool. And as transaction inputs are just revering to previous transactions (but also the address ), identifying them as certain services isn't that hard. (Also this is why address reuse is terrible). 
for example: 
Blockchain info knows its the Bitcointoyou Hot Wallet , censoring that  kind of transactions would be a real problem. (This is also a plea to any BU supporters, get the f away from antpool/bitmain, go mine at bitcoin.com/via/slush at least thats not becoming a mining conglomerate. )
@_date: 2017-03-31 21:42:58
They signal everything. Segwit, BU with EB 25 AD 23, BIP 148 (UASF), BIP 101 8MB blocks, BIP 109 (2MB classic), Check sequence verify, with either coinbase message or BIP9.

@_date: 2017-03-20 13:06:20
If a certain group of miners gets a majority, or even a big enough part of hashrate. They can censor transactions, making certain parties unwanted on the network. Lets say one would combine walletexplorer.com with the txs a miner would allow in its blocks, because of either economical/political/governmental majority controlling those miner(s). 
Think what happens when a majority of miners, reject/delay alphabay,localbitcoins origin based transactions. 
tldr; Centralization of miners is bad.

Fungibility for bitcoin means that 1 bitcoin has a value that is the same as any other bitcoin. Which atm is a problem, because all bitcoins have a history, which can be SilkRoad, Gamblingwebsites, known darkmarkets, other exchanges etc. There are certain exchanges that use these kind of tools, to prevent money laundering , and add to KYC/AML. Those parties are refusing to take those bitcoins because of their history, creating a gap between "fresh mined bitcoins" (where the previous transaction was a coinbase/blockreward) and coins that have passed several darkmarkets. 
There is a solution for this problem, which is Schnorsignatures, which would create financial incentive to create a coinjoin transaction. (A coinjoin transaction is a transaction where multiple parties provide inputs and outputs, providing deniability on the origin of those parts, because they are all in a mixing transaction) This could provide additional privacy and make the transaction in itself cheaper because of the schnorsignature, providing 1 signature instead of multiple signatures, making the transaction smaller in size, hence cheaper feewise.

No, it's the opposite. If you move many unspent outputs with only 1 satoshi, you are moving references to every transaction on the next one. That transaction would be large in size.

Let's say you are a merchant, and you are selling something (regardless of legality ). And I'm a competitor trying to see how much you transact:
1. I either buy something or try to acquire at least 1 address of which I'm certain it belongs to your wallet.
2. I wait until you spend those coins, but by spending them also might want to spend all the other payments you got. Revealing other addresses, that have a very high probability to be linked to your service.
3. Here is where dusting attacks come in. Repeating 1 and 2 is relatively expensive. But what if you would send 546 satoshi. (the amount above the dust limit), and i start sending them every week to addresses obtained by doing 1. Each time your wallet then spends that 546 satoshi, you are revealing information.

Well a bunch of nodes is also needed for relaying and validating the blocks. If there are not enough nodes that accept bu block as valid, you do have network isolation again bu.

Sorry, i'm running multiple but it only makes sense to have 1 listening node, and having some others just force connecting to certain ips. Also I don't think that evil bunch of nodes on DigitalOcean can be counted as nodes. (Multibit/BitcoinJ) because their behaviour is off for those kind of nodes. (It's like some company is listening to nodes, to see transaction origin that doesn't want to use proper (full) nodes for that, I think we all know who that is)

It's possible to spend unconfirmed inputs, thats just building on an unconfirmed transaction. But it is impossible to have confirmations on a spend output of a child of an unconfirmed transaction without having the parent transaction in the same block, or any block before that.

I really need to fair about this issue. A bitcoin company has only one liability. Providing service. With the current amount of influx in bitcoin going on, switching to P2WSH is a problem. Because new customers are going to send bitcoincash to those addresses, and the redeemscript is not going to be valid on the bitcoincash chain, effectively burning bitcoincash and providing an unsolvable (well bitcoincash could do segwit) problem. I can understand that ppl would like to wait to use bech32.

Step 1. Become an ASIC manifacturer

Step 3. Create and/or fund other mining pools, and make them payout 110% of blockreward.
Step 4. Make noise, block everything with above companies, halt any form of devwork, and maintain status quo.
Step 5. Force a hardfork which splits Bitcoin. Have companies/mining pools from step 3 on your side.
Step 6. Using Asics from step 1 to force 51%.

There real question is: Can you activate SegWit with bit4 when bit2 is still active, or do we need to wait until 15 Nov + 2 weeks &gt;80%. While HF should be before 23 Nov. I get the feeling we are being bamboozled .
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:48:20
Step 1. Bitmain
Step 2. KnCminer (  )
Step 3. Bitcoin.com/ConnectBTC/BTC.com/Antpool/ViaBTC
Step 4. Scream: Transactionbacklog,Nakamoto Concensus, BU/EC/ExtBlocks/8MB but not segwit as SF. Segwit as SF , that would mess with step 2.
Step 5. Get some companies to sign a document for Segwit+2MBHF. (So you can still do asicboost for step 6)

1. No. the only indication is slush miner preference.
2. There is no list
3. Because of the way BIP91 has been integrated in Segwit2X. There are 3 windows of activating segwit before the 1st of august. Failure to keep up the segwit2x NYA agreement, or failure to keep up with it in time will create a chainsplit. (Which is different from a contentious hardfork ofc.) We just set a deadline on segwit activation and make sure miners keep their promise. If they don't well, its them creating a chainsplit. 
tldr; if miners keep their agreement, bip148 will be a non event. Else it shows the value of non digital signed agreements, malicious intent from the miners, and the unwillingness to activate segwit.

Q: Are the blocks spent or is there an other block mined that is of interrest that is partialy spent?
Q: What kind of hardware was the block mined on. (gives an estimation of difficulty)
There are a lot of blocks from those days that are not spend yet.
