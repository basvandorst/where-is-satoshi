FLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOR (at 8k probably)
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:52:01
futures ending, gdax opening bch/btc, and the price drama might be cooking up a mighty storm
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:06:11
ohhh a Pokémon car! Makes perfect sense!

What makes you say that? (Tommy wiseau accent)

hodl me ;_;
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:37:58
my guess is that when gdax open bch/btc the higher the price of bch the more btc people will get when they trade, so its being pumped before the trading pair is available
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:46:35
don't do it the buyer can report the transaction as unauthorised and reclaim his funds, leaving you without bitcoin and fiat. I lost 0.2 btc this way.
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:25:38
The panic selling is insane sometimes, people think the bubble has popped when it dips a little bit hahaha
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:09:22
Time for a ridiculous bull run

With great price comes great memes
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:01:20
I doubt that'll happen purely because of the amount of people invested and institutional money in the crypto market. But if it hits 2.7 fuck it ill be buying a couple

I think one of the nodes that track the mempool got reset that day, falsely showing the mempool being "empty" 
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:24:32
Same, fingers crossed
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:12:46
I'm with you on this one. People are quick to write off crypto as a scam as rather than learning about the tech they're too focused on price like 90% of casual "investors" 
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:12:00
a bit of both, I don't think there's as much people using btc as there was during the insane bull run to 20k
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:40:07
Someone should fork bitcoin cash and call it bcash and proclaim it's the "real" bitcoin cash, calling bitcoin cash "bitcoin cash core". Confused yet? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:00:32
it has shown me de way
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:13:23
this, looking bullish, plus im assuming those who sold during korea fud may buy back in over the next day or so
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:28:18
such manipulation very satoshi much wow

Damn. I can see where he's getting his arguments from by saying the whole timeline thing, but its very clear that they're supporting a coin that uses the bitcoin name as much as it can to promote itself. Saying that their coin is the "real" bitcoin or satoshi's "real vision" gives me a headache, let alone using btc in their reddit or "bitcoin core" and cash distinctions.
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:21:32
what if the US govt is satoshi? :o :o :o
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:21:37
judging by the robinhood sign ups we will hopefully have A huge run at some point
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:10:59
if bitcoin is the internet of money, and most of the internet is cats, does that mean cats = money?
@_date: 2018-01-13 01:00:01

@_date: 2017-12-20 02:51:54
yes but I've seen a few comments that people are having their orders cancelled with the bch returned to their accounts
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:33:52
I hope january brings a good bull run after this stagnation over the holidays

I wonder if litecoin could be the silver to bitcoins gold in future?
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:22:53
In the future leople will ask "Where were you when Vegeta scanned bitcoins power level?" haha

I'm fairly confident in the price going up depending on adoption rates, this drop is a short term thing in my opinion
