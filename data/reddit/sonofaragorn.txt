Interesting. How would one purchase this? (Sorry for the newb question)

I was in Tokyo last week trying to find an ATM to buy Bitcoin (had some left over cash and figured it was a better option than using a regular fiat exchange).
I failed. I went to a place in Ginza (The Snack) but the ATM was in Japanese and required creating an account with BitOcean (and a local phone line).
I guess it just shows how while Bitcoin has grown a lot, it still is in its early days.

I've been in Japan for 6 weeks now (leaving today actually, typing from Narita airport) and my foreign bank card decided to stop working about 3 weeks ago. How awesome will it be when I can just withdraw some of my bitcoin easily!?
I did end up doing the next best thing, borrowed from a colleague and paid him back immediately with bitcoin :) I was able to survive for 3 more weeks and he was very happy to finally join the boat!!

I might create a new topic for this, but maybe can someone explain what is difficulty behind setting an ATM? (I know the actual machine is around $5000 so I wonder why there aren't many already)

I'm in Toronto. There aren't many places that accept bitcoin. Make sure to have accessibility to CAD

Warren Buffet is that you?

They might be small, but they must have gotten a lot of funding recently if they are able to bring this kind of people on board.
@_date: 2014-02-24 06:38:38
noob here. Would you care to explain?

Where in Canada?

I think vaultofsatoshi.com doesn't require verification if you are only trading digital coins.

Was about to say this. Honestly, it is the first time I've seen someone with that last name in real life.

Hey! I'm in the same wagon, did you end up going? would you recommend it? Thanks :)
@_date: 2014-08-15 05:37:50
This genuinely made me laugh. Have your upvote

Funny how the second top comment in your old post mentions China in the top 3 reasons why this crash wouldn't be as bad as previous ones
@_date: 2014-03-21 20:10:21
Hey I'm also in Canada :) 
I think the scenario here is way different. For example, Vault of Satoshi, the exchange, is now even accepting payments online to fund your account.
In the meantime, this minister in Colombia is saying that ALL bitcoin transactions are illegal!

So, if they had $2,700,000 USD deposited in January of 2012, how much money did they have right before the crisis started?
I think I didn't realize before the magnitude of the fraud that has been happening right in front of our eyes.

May I ask which VPN provider did you chose? 
It has been 3 hours now, would you mind sharing your initial thoughts? Thanks

Hi Carlos. 
I'm afraid the internal discussion is way more advanced and this will be released before your meeting. The quote in the article is from the head of the Treasury, so I think we are screwed. 
I still can't believe that the minister actually the words "we have the monopoly". Crazy.
Anyways good luck in the meeting and please do keep us posted!

If Bitcoin is supposed to be decentralized, global currency then this MUST affect it in the grand scheme of things.

I really really hope that you are right!

It is unbelievable! They clearly say we HAVE THE MONOPOLY.

What about Canada?
@_date: 2014-03-27 04:22:14
+1. I was thoroughly impressed with the people involved. Honestly, the day after I saw that (~1 month ago) I bought my first bitcoin.

I'm trying to convince my mom to start selling her awesome flower arrangements online, but I must confess that it is mostly because I want to set her up to accept bitcoin

I think vault of satoshi know has coin trading
@_date: 2015-08-08 15:17:20
UNLESS we actually buy the special. I think it is worth it.

Ever since VoS disappeared I've sort of been out of the loop regarding exchanges. Is this one that I can trust? Should I be excited?
I was just reading it says 1% transaction fee. Is that considered reasonable?

Congratulations on having "plenty of other money available" :)
