I believe that here it's just about being more specific about restrictions on bitcoin and all other altcoins.
The thing is, it's opening doors to more specific discussion about whether bitcoin is allowed or not in specific country / state of USA.

In my opinion, Litecoin have a very small differentiator over bitcoin, then it means it will decline in value and usage as bitcoin have more interest or other currency have more attractiveness (Darkcoin, vertcoin, etc).
Disclaimer : i'm a Litecoin miner, but i kind of believe that even if it good for tests, that is not going to be a good investment :)
Bitcoin is a different story, more and more people / stores are using it across the globe. Therefore more and more value on a long term perspective.
I bet here that we will see impressive things when 10% of the world will be using Bitcoin.

How about using the actual classical path with finance and weapon industry in the US :
How about financing Bitcoin political campaign and actors that in return will be favorable to Bitcoin existence in the real world ? If political guys take their cut at this stage, they will see the bright side of it ?
I'm only thinking out loud.

I do believe that on the fundamentals, Theo is absolutely right.
There is a lack of people who help to fight against this BitLicence that could cause harm and precedents in the rest of the world.
Regulation should help, not discriminate and give too much decision power on entities that are not designed for it. Moreover, this could kill a well needed competition for better services in finance in general, in crypto-currencies in particular.
Thanks Théo, it's well needed :
I wish you will win this fight.

I've added 2 places in Lille for 4 days now with a "payment:bitcoin = yes" and nothing on the  . Is there a latency somewhere ?
I've added the black night and Envies de Saison.
By the way, utocat.com is starting to install PoS applications in Bar / restaurants in France.
