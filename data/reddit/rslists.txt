How did you set up bitcoin payments on the website?

Because if you haven't noticed bitcoin is slowly becoming more mainstream with more noobs buying in at the height of the market. These noobs see a drop on coinmarketcap and look at the all time price history and think history is going to repeat itself and perform a bear market for the next 2 years.
Noobs will panic, there is no denying this, and these noobs will put a little strain on the market, but soon it will be a fantastic buying opportunity.

You know bitcoin is in a bubble when people are talking about going to the moon.

Don't listen to the HODL guys, other people will panic which will reduce the price, so may as well sell and buy in a few days and you will have more btc. Take advantage of the crash if you have balls.

So wait, If I have a bitcoin, I can split it and end up with 2 new tokens and still hold my original btc?
