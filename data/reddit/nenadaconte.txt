Hey, support just sent me this. They say it has been sent and that this is proof :-/ 
Is this enough proof? 
@_date: 2017-03-23 00:10:24
But they did leave my wallet. That's the strange thing.

Is the adress I sent it to. 
My adress is : 
My wallet ( localbitcoins ) shows in my transaction list that I sent the Bitcoins ( went from my total saldo ) and it shows : '' withdraw '' type. 
Don't know what happened :-/

Where can I see that please :/ ? Should I look that up in my wallet history?

Hey, support just sent me the info about the transaction. Could you please explain / clarify what happened with the transaction and if this is enough proof to sent to the receiver :/

So it's guaranteed that they will come back to my wallet? 
The adress I sent it to couldn't be found by Blockchain and my own adress shows no transactions :-/

My own transaction ID shows no transactions happened and the adress I sent it to doesn't seam to exist.

I opened a ticket with them. My wallet had money and I even took screenshots and such . The transaction history in localbitcoins even shows that it's sent and that a fee was taken. My account security was low.

It's not found in my own transaction history on blockchain and the adress I sent it to doesn't exist appearently.

This is the transaction ID. 
Could you tell me what it says?

I recently received bitcoin from someone, couldn't that be that 1 transaction? 
I sent bitcoin a few min ago to someone and I wonder if that transaction has reached them.

Where can I see to what adress I sent it, please?
