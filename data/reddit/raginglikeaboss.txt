Unfortunately the "tokens" are not true equity until Bitfinex finalizes the terms.  There is no way in Hell they are going to be producing proper Accountings that would be required to shareholders.
I understand you'd much rather have most of your money back rather than nothing - but do not think that what they are doing is even remotely legal.
In addition, who would even want equity in a company that has destroyed its brand and is quite literally incapable of paying back their liabilities.  They are forcing these "tokens" &amp; their socialized loss program onto customers exclusively because they are legally insolvent otherwise.
My recommendation is pull any funds out as soon as you can, and never come back.  They have proven without a doubt that they are incapable of managing this level of customer assets in a secure manner.

I completely agree with you.  Just curious why SegWit as a soft-fork doesn’t count as a minor version increment.

You're acting in a very immature manner by calling people who disagree with you "infants."
The Bitcoin network needs a capacity increase, however that is done I truly couldn't care less.
The "roadmap" is too little too late.  It proves that Bitcoin development is not as decentralized as many would have you believe.  The network is beginning to bog down no matter how you think about it.  Normal high fee paying transactions are taking much longer to confirm than they used to, this is a problem that should have been addressed before when it was originally being debated.
I just want Bitcoin to work.  Currently it is showing major weaknesses and strain.

Why would they make it decentralized or anonymous?  That would violate common sense as a business and KYC/AML.

I've seen estimates even higher on this subreddit to nearly 20% but always without source.  Coinbase is a large exchange that is fully regulated so it has the largest amount of investments by institutions of any exchange currently.  Gemini was launched to try and capture this market, but thus far hasn't come close.
Just remember it's Coinbase that has control over the private keys, so they can do what they want, but since it is regulated they would be held financially and criminally responsible for misuse or fraud.
Coinbase is better for investors, or those simply using it to buy Bitcoin and move it out ASAP, than it is to use as storage.

My main issue is the lack of how easy it is for newcomers.  Luckily all of my newcomer mistakes turned out fine in the end.  It would be nice if more wallets allowed easy to use interfaces regarding fees as 'advanced' options and auto-calculated estimates with high bids for 'basic' options - perfect for newbies.
Some wallets have this, but it's not universal.  Would it fix the entire problem?  Doubt it, but it could dampen the overall numbers until people learned the ropes a bit.

How so?
He has already publicly stated his company is an exchange.  The transactions used in trading are already off-chain, within the company.  He desires more widespread use, leading to higher prices and ipso facto, more trades.  That's solid business practice.
You and I want more users because this leads to more involvement, higher prices, therefore our Bitcoin is worth more.
Coinbase does not use a blockchain, they use an off-chain.  You seem to be ignoring what "ironically" actually means.  You sound like a 15 year old.  At least you understand it's punctuation, quotation...
Coinbase is the largest Bitcoin company in existence, its opinion is relevant regardless if you agree with it or not.

If you want those Bitcoin, I'd say it worth it.  The file is encrypted (I hope) and they wouldn't even need to know why you're trying to repair it.  Just that is stopped working and you need to access files.
But of course hindsight is 20/20, I always recommend a RAID0+1.  I know, it's too soon to hear that, but I'm sure they'll be able to fix your drives.
Just remember to ship the, in individual electro-static bags, and possible ship them via FedEx/UPS insured electronic designed corrugated (with additional film-lining) to be extra safe, and this way insurance will cover you.
I wish you luck sir, I had to do this once myself.  Cost around ~$700 but I had IP work and legal papers that I absolutely had to recover, hence I learned RAID0+1 that hard way as well.

You can complain the IRS collecting taxes for the Federal government, which may spend that money in an inefficient or immoral manner - but you cannot ignore the fact that much of the Federal taxes you pay actually go to useful programs such as research &amp; development on medicine, technology, and paying our troops.
Yes, the IRS collecting taxes for the Federal government allows the Federal government to spend it unwisely or even immorally.  But Capital Gains taxes predominantly effect the higher-income brackets and are essential in providing services that are needed in this country.
We all agree that there is rampant waste and corporate-cronyism, ranging from lobbyists from every sector, all the way to effectively 'buying' politicians was super-PAC money who then go on to further the agenda of industry-sectors from which they were paid by.

I completely agree with what you're saying, but his point was that you 100% can use certain VISA cards to pay for at any store that accepts VISA directly from your Bitcoin wallet.  The Card Issuer buys the Bitcoin from you the second you swipe the card, but they've already paid the merchant as that card finishes swiping.
There is no "physical Bitcoin."  You can think of the Bitcoin blockchain as a Microsoft Excel sheet that any person on earth can run on most devices to validate every single transaction.
With all that said though...
I would never EVER want my spending "cash" on my debit card to be worth $500 when I get my morning coffee, but then all of a sudden be worth $100 when I go to buy my lunch.  Just seems asinine to me.  Like, why not just use physical cash like a normal person and know what it's worth because it says so on the damn cash.

It would definitely be in bad taste to rub it in the faces of those that were too timid or lacked the depth of technical knowledge to realize Bitcoins potential.  But I have no problem with people rubbing it in the faces of those that bashed them personally for investing early enough.

Blockchain.info works great as a custodian wallet for Bitcoin &amp; Ethereum.  Their iOS app is fantastic.  Just don’t leave much on your blockchain wallet because of a higher risk of being hacked.
Hardware wallets are the way to go.

This issue has been discussed in so much detail since 2013 it boggles my mind how it was ignored until the evil-doers and axis-of-evil Bitcoin XT camp sprung up, followed by a much stronger grassroots Bitcoin Classic insurgency developed.

It brought me into Bitcoin, and all my co-workers that I taught Bitcoin usage and the value of its underlying technology.  They loved how they could link a bank account, buy some Bitcoin, and then sell parts that they made thru eCommerce back to their bank account.  Bitcoin truly is a great settlement layer as well as a very functional currency for eCommerce.
The biggest advantage of using a regulated exchange is for people such as myself that need the proper documentation in order to file appropriate Capital Gains taxes.
By saying, "I don't think Coinbase is bringing anyone to Bitcoin: They are filling a market need: If we didn't have Coinbase, somebody else would be the largest usd-&gt;btc otc broker," you are easily countered by my and co-workers experience.  All together we have injected quite a few figures into the Bitcoin ecosystem, particularly in its usage as a currency.
But!  I will completely agree with you that just because a product is great and helps enrich Bitcoin, does not mean that the CEO, Brian Armstrong, is a person of high moral fortitude.  Whether he's good or bad is irrelevant to me.  I don't need to rely on anyone's trust in Bitcoin and that's why I enjoy it so much.

Thanks for the reply!
I won't lie, though I run a few nodes on servers I own, I'm not always Johnny-on-the-spot when it comes to updating the nodes; Bitcoin is a small hobby for me but I like to support the network.
I haven't checked source in a couple of updates, which goes against most of my experience as a web admin, so really thank you for the quick reply.
Back to source I go.  Nothing more intelligent than that.

I'm glad the attempt was made and communications were re-established in person, but your reaction is shared by many.
The issue regarding scalabity is incredibly complex on a technical level and the risks on an economic level are massive.  It's the main reason I do not mind multiple groups working on different clients in parallel to each other, they learn more of what the community wants in this manner.  Without XT earlier in 2015 and Classic/Unlimited in 2016 I do not see how Core would have ever made these meetings and established a roadmap for 'scaling'.  The fringe groups such as Classic/Unlimited/XT have very little chance at success becoming the dominant system, but their ideas certainly have been influential on Core developers.
@_date: 2016-02-29 21:20:38
I'm glad there are others out there that have noticed this aspect of a fee market.  While a fee market is not a bad thing at all and is designed into the protocol, businesses will learn how to save customers money in order to gain their business a competitive edge.
Good or bad, personally I think it's healthy because it makes Coinbase more competitive.

Well we need to come to a consensus before we set about an ETA in which a meeting to discuss when the ETA can be held regarding the implementation of the Lightning Network.

The definition of "spam transactions" in was valid until normal fee paying transactions designed to confirm in 1-2 blocks began taking 4-8 blocks.  So much for ~10 minutes, welcome to ~60 minutes.  I never trust transactions to confirm quickly when I purchase products or trade in values of 1 XBT or less.

I know I do, good thing the market cap on Bitcoin is still too low for Uncle Sam to be 'overtly' worried.
Not to mention, you do know that they can eventually track a Tor user, correct?  SR was a fine example of the FBI out-sourcing to universities to achieve that goal at minimal cost.  (The grant was for $1 million.)

Playing devils advocate here, but what other company has brought as many new users into the Bitcoin ecosystem other than "slime balls like Brian" and Coinbase?

I use Coinbase, but I transfer in money first - then I place my staggered orders to buy Bitcoin on GDAX.  This way I'm not paying the high market price at the moment or buying it all at once.
It also works the same way when selling.  I'll transfer some Bitcoin over to Coinbase, and then stagger my sell offers in exchange for USD.  I go back and forth, the profits slowly begin to accumulate as long as you are very patient and stick to a well-reasoned trading strategy.

I completely understand when people make a thread regarding how much they love using the BreadWallet app on iOS or even their brand new Trevor - because these products help Bitcoin for specific users.

I will absolutely agree with that assessment, expect when I place a Buy then the Sell is automatically less.
Not a perfect system, but maybe Circle is onto something as.  I use both as it is, but Ii prefer Dollar-cost-averaging via Coinbase and Circle for Dollar-volume-averaging.
I find them both useful.
