go to preev.com for a simple bitcoin to USD converter calculator. put the 0.01 in the bitcoin side and you can watch the USD value as it moves up and down and updates the price every couple of seconds

download the bread wallet app again on your new device. you can enter the bread wallet app recovery phrase into the bread wallet. It doesn't work in other wallets. Does Breadwallet work on android?

try out btc-e it is a fun place to start. it has a troll box. and you don't have to enter any personal information. It has been considered kinda shady but overall pretty great for beginners. I traded Noob Hard style back in the day on tons of exchanges. alot of mistakes get made. beware the "fat thumb" trade that happens when you push one button to many times
here are some handy sites to check out. bitcoinwisdom.com for charts coinmarketcap.com has a leaderboard on all the currencies price movements.  preev.com is a simple bitcoin to usd calculator that is super handy  
I totally lost money. and at some points made lots of money then immediatly lost it. all over the place.
I watch the charts all the time but i haven't actively traded in a while. and am not a great trader or anything
  Never leave your money in a shady exchange, they do steal and sell bogus stuff.
or maybe you should skip using btc-e and go directly to a bitfinex or bitstamp or huobi  because grownups use a stoploss so that they can sleep at night

In that case Borrow somebodies Iphone and download the breadwallet and recover the wallet then send the bitcoin to your mycellium wallets Bitcoin address.   
One time my kid deleted a bunch of apps including my breadwallet. I re downloaded the wallet and didn't even need to enter the recovery code because it was the same device. which is kind of interesting. it still had the same 4 digit pass code also
