I did that when I graduated from college. I traveled Europe for a year and then drove around the US for 6 months, living out of a car and a tent. It was amazing.
Since I did all that traveling when I was young, I no longer have the travel bug or any feelings of wistfulness.7-8 years later, and I'm 30 now, and I can focus on myself and my career and I feel great. All my other friends are turning 30 and they dread life. "I'll never get to see the world." "I'll never travel." "Is this all there is?" So many of them want to quit and chase something. I'm content, just living my life now.

It would work like [fractional reserve banking]( They could let people trade with more coins than are actually on the exchange, and they'd only get into trouble if a ton of people withdrew their coins at the same time. But as long as enough people keep their coins on the exchange, their coins could simply be an integer on a database and not real coins at all.
I'm not saying they do this, but it's totally doable.

And, I also had a special person to travel with as well. It was different girls on each trip, but I'll give you some advice that may or may not be relevant to you. Now, I know nothing about you and your girlfriend, but be prepared for the impact of spending 24 hours a day with the same period over long periods of time. On my US road trip especially, we literally read some books on interpersonal communication and whatnot. We listened to some interviews with couple's counselors too. We really had to learn to communicate well because things can get tense when you're with the same person too long. That part of those trips have really stuck with me actually. Because of those trips, I'm a *way* better person and boyfriend now because I know how to listen and talk to people without it breaking down into an argument or a fight. 
Well, excuse me for getting to serious. 
Have fun and travel cheap. You can go a whole long way on not that much money if you travel right.

Not really. Too many people look at the USD value instead of the ratio.
Bcash has had a hard time staying above .1 bitcoin pretty much since it forked. It's at .2ish right now, but it's during the middle of a pump. Expect it to drop over the next few weeks. 
Basically, it's only worth more in USD now because bitcoin is worth more in USD now too.

Let me try to find it. As we were driving one day, there was a lady on NPR who was plugging her book on communication between couples. And there was this weird moment where we were like, "Wow. This lady is basically describing a ton of issues we're having right now." Next time we were at a book store, we bought the book and both read it, and it helped *a lot*. As a 30 year old male, it's weird how vivid my memory is of this lady and her couples communication book. I read like 6 years ago but I still use a lot of her ideas.

I don't keep my Bitcoin on an exchange, so I don't have sell orders. I bought $5k of bitcoin at $4400. So, while it would unfortunate to lose my initial $5k investment, it wouldn't be the end of the world. I've only invested what I'm willing to risk and lose.
Bitcoin isn't really and investment for me. While it would be great to make money off it, I'm really participating in something bigger. I enjoy the community, the technology, and the movement.

Sorry, I ignored a ton of your questions. I don't mine and I'm not *too* familiar of how it works, but I can shed *some* light.
The difficulty is increased every 2 weeks. The goal is to only allow 1 block to be mined every 10 minutes. By the end of each 2 week period, blocks are being mined every 9.5 minutes or so. So the difficulty is recalculated so that it goes back to 10 minutes. The block reward is 12.5 bitcoins. Whoever mines the block gets it. You have to invest a lot of money to be able to mine a block. And you can't do it unless you're part of a mining pool because the competition is so fierce.

Yeah, it's a perfectly fine solution technically to just use smaller units, but I also agree with you. Psychology, I'm not really sure it's going to work very well. Unit pricing bias is a real thing. Most people see $10k bitcoin and think, "10k for one coin? That's way too expensive."
A split might be ideal and could be accomplished somehow with a hardfork, but it would require a consensus that I just doubt could happen.
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:22:41
Dude. Come on. Don't be so obtuse. 


No shit. I never said anything in the contrary. Why make that point? What does that have to do with anything? I agree with that statement! I already said:  


Your original question:


So I answered: I would rather have excellent returns on Bitcoin than buy altcoins. I view altcoin investors as people buyinglottery tickets. I don't know where you're from, but in the US a lottery ticket analogy means gambling at insane odds to win insane amount of money. You replied:


Which totally misses my point and my analogy. 50% returns is not a lottery ticket. 1,000,000,000% returns is a lottery ticket where I'm from. (example, $5 can win you $50 million)
In fact, you agree with me, but you're so focused on stupid details and arguing about dumb shit that you can't even see it. You're so far off track your in the parking lot yelling at a car.
I said I prefer bitcoin because it has great returns: better returns than a hedge fund and the S &amp; P 500. 
Altcoins = spending your money on lottery tickets. Tiny chance to make insane profits. I'm not seeking insane profits. Again, let me quantify what I mean by insane profits so you don't argue that %50 in 3 months *is* insane profits. I'm talking about buying thousands of bitcoins for cents on the dollar. I'm not trying to recreate that by chasing bitcoin.


Where did I say that? What are you acting like I said that? Why aren't you talking about altcoins versus bitcoin and the question you asked me? Why are you so confused by my lottery ticket analogy? Why are you stuck on my gold analogy? Who cares if gold is a shitty store of value or it's great in jewelry? This has nothing to do with my larger answer to your question. 
If you think altcoins are worth investing in, then tell me about that. But instead you start arguing with me that 50% returns is like winning a lottery ticket and all this bull shit that misses the entire point completely. I wanted to have an insightful conversation with you but your head is just too far up your ass. I've got to block you. You're just insufferable. You sound smart, but you really have to learn open your point of view a bit more. Your points aren't even wrong, they're just super off target. You're right about your facts, but it's like, why are you saying these things? Why can't he stay on topic? Does he just want to be right? Even if it's for stupid things that I'm not talking about?

There is more to this attack than which chain the miners choose to mine. There is clearly a campaign of hired bcash shills working hard right now. The network is full of spam. The Bcash pump started from purchases mostly on Korean exchanges, etc.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:10:35


I didn't have that opportunity. But I'm still up 58% on bitcoin right now, in 3 months. That's more than I made on gold in 3 years, so I'm happy. That's a lot compared to most investments. I think it's silly that so many people want a winning lottery ticket. I'm not looking to make 10,000%. I have more realistic goals.


Nah. I'm not interested in the altcoins, though I have bought and sold litecoin and monero for a good profit. I think the altcoins are way, way more likely to be worthless in the future than bitcoin. First mover advantage and the network effect are huge. It's not worth the risk to me. I think crypto works best as a store of value, just like gold, and bitcoin does that well enough.. 90% of the altcoins have no chance and they're trying to solve some problem I don't care about. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:10:08

When I was 19, in June 2008, I bought gold and silver. I sold it in May 2011. I used GoldMoney. I had to wire my $8k to the Cayman Islands and they stored my gold in Switzerland. It was pretty stressful. My parents thought I was crazy, but I made like 50% on my gold and silver, cashing out with $12k. I only bought it because I was into Ron Paul at the time, and all the Libertarians were squawking about the market collapse, the gold standard, and whatnot. Now I'm a Bernie Sanders liberal, but I still see the value of Bitcoin.
When I bough Bitcoin, I was like, "Hey, this is how it's done!" So easy! Though my parents still think I'm crazy.
Writing that makes me feel like such a male millennial stereotype.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:35:48
You can only buy whole stocks.  If a stock is $50 then you have to spend a multiple of $50 when you buy those stocks. Bitocoin breaks down into millionths. You can buy 1/1,000,000 of a bitcoin. 
So you don't need to do a stock split for bitcoin. You just need to think about bitcoin in smaller units. It's a bit of a paradigm shift. Look at this website:
They measure bitcoin in smaller units.

You're missing the point. I'm not taking you literally. I'm satirizing your comment by pointing out similar scenarios where you could take advantage of a trust system. If this coffee place allows poorly validated transactions, they understand the risk, and they are simply trusting their customers.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:55:56
You said you're a newb, so I'm guessing you don't really know too much about bitcoin, but it probably doesn't work how you imagine it. 
Unless you know more than I realize, so correct me if I'm wrong. 


This isn't really how it works. Do you know how mining pools work? Do you know what the block reward is? 
I suggest this class if you have time:
Don't worry about the assignments. Just watch the lectures. Only like 3 of the weeks are technical and they rest are just high level ideas. If you don't have a background in programming, just try to follow as much as possible, but they're pretty accessible courses.
There are some lectures just on mining. I don't remember how well they stand on their own, so I suggest watching them in order.
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:10:36


Getting 50% in 3 months on an investment is way, way, way easier than winning a significant amount of money with lottery ticket. That's not the point, anyway. My point is there are a lot of people who want to get rich buying altcoins because it's too late to make 10,000+% buying bitcoin. And I think it's silly to try to replicate the success of early bitcoin adopters. Those returns are unlikely to happen again in crypto. Those people who bought $1000+ of bitcoin when it was less than a dollar, and still have it, are rarer than people who've won the lottery. I'd rather stick with bitcoin because I have more realistic goals for my return.
Most of gold's value is only what people are willing to pay for it because its scarcity and for some reason we've decided it's valuable. It's ability to work as a storage of value has gone down significantly since money is no longer backed by a gold reserve. It's utility value is much lower than its current price. 
If you want to engage with me on this topic, then do so. But you're making a lot of silly points just for the sake of correcting me, and you're missing the bigger ideas. Do you have a bigger point to make or do you just get off on trying to correct little details?

@_date: 2017-11-07 19:17:28
Yes, I agree completely. 
I was being light-hearted. If you want put me on trial, then, yes, I should have said, "the kind of person who buys gold will also be attracted to buying bitcoin, especially the guy that made 50% profit on gold in 3 years." I acknowledge that I was gambling when I bought gold and it was not a skill-based investment. I was simply betting against the dollar, and 19-year-old could not have suspected the economy was going to go into a severe recession several months later. But then my college tuition went up 40% in one quarter and I graduated in a shit market, so there's my "luck."
I don't expect bitcoin to go from $7000 to $816,000,000. I'd be happy with 5-10% a year. And I acknowledge that I'm gambling on Bitcoin this time instead on gold. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:41:01
Yes, though you need to change your language.
"One loaf is one Satoshi."
I don't say, "One loaf is 100 cents." We just need to adapt the language.

Yeah, I haven't encouraged anyone to invest because I don't want that kind of responsibility if things go bad. This is new territory and there are no guarantees. I've invested what I'm willing to lose.
I mentioned it to my parents and I didn't know they already had a really bad impression of bitcoin. Hah. They looked really disappointed in me. 
My friend bought some though, and I didn't even suggest it or know she bought it intil later. She remembers in 2008 when i bought $8k in gold and then sold in a couple years later for $12k. So she thinks I have credibility, even though i was just lucky.
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:21:01


@_date: 2017-11-07 17:55:51
It was pure luck. I think I sold the day after it was reported that Osama Bin Laden was killed. I was reading some libertarian/gold news websites and some said they thought that would affect the price of gold a lot. So I sold. Looking back, that was a really weird and irrational reason to sell. But the timing worked out pretty well, even if by pure coincidence. 
I never saw or held my gold. Glad 19-year-old me didn't get ripped off. 
I didn't get into bitcoin until last august. But it really clicked with me and my mindset. The kind of person who buys gold in 2008 understands the potential of Bitcoin. I've made a big effort to understand the technology too.

It's volatile because it's so young, thinly traded, hardly used (anchored to real purchases) and hardly anyone owns any of it. I'm not going to argue that bitcoin is going to succeed, but volatility would go away with adoption. It's a chicken and the egg scenario. No one will use bitcoin because it's volatile. But volatility would go away if people used it.
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:17:48
Bitcoin emailed you?
@_date: 2018-02-18 16:40:07
The single main point of bitcoin is to be decentralized, and it is the first decentralized currency. It is not the first digital currency, and it being digital is not what is revolutionary about it. It's main goal is not to be fast and cheap. It's main goal is to maintain decentralization.
How much monopoly money has been created (no idea)?  How much monopoly money will be created (no idea)? Who creates monopoly money (hasbro)? 
There are about 16.8 million bitcoins. There will be 21 million and no more. The last bitcoin will be created in the year 2140. Who creates new bitcoins? That's complicated, but the simple answer is they are given out semi-randomly as reward for maintaining the bitcoin network.
And sure, there are limited editions video game skins, but they are created by the developers of the video game, and the developers can keep making as many skins as they want. They can pump out millions and flood the market. The game developers and Hasbro are the central banks in this system. You have to trust them because they can do whatever they want because these systems are centralized. They can mint however much they want. In bitcoin, there is no analogous central bank like Hasbro or the game developers. There is no one who can keep minting as many coins as they want. There is no one who can shut the network down. There is no one who can freeze your account, reverse your transactions, or take your coins away without your permission.
Again, I'm not going to argue that bitcoin is going to succeed. But I will argue that Bitcoin is the first of its kind and this is an experiment worth having, no matter how risky it is. Those of us involved must acknowledged the risk and acknowledge that we are participating in something that has never happened before and the odds are greatly against us. 
So when I see these comparisons to monopoly money or beanie babies or tulips or video game skins, I slap myself in the forehead. They are terrible analogies and don't make any sense if you know how bitcoin actually works. It's like someone saya, "Global warming? But it snowed yesterday!" These people clearly have a shallow understanding global warming. And you clearly don't understand even the basic premise of bitcoin, based your comments. 
I just wish more people would acknowledge their poor understanding off bitcoin and not form an opinion anyway. Skepticism is healthy, but what happened to curiosity? What happened to asking questions or trying learn more? Or at least saying, "I don't understand it, so I'll sit out of this conversation." Too many people criticize things they have no authority to criticize.

What the fuck does Barry have to do with Trump not being an idiot? Lol. You Trump supporters love to divert and talk about something else whenever things get uncomfortable. Let's say Barry is a puppet. Bam. I agree. Now let's talk about Trump's idiocy.
Maybe Trump is suffering from old age and that's how he was successful? (I think Trump is in terrible debt and has *way* less money than he says, but that has nothing to do with his intelligence either.) 
The person who I see speak on tv is not a smart person. He rambles, he can't stay on topic, he makes weird constructions with his words, etc etc. I have never seen Trump talk for 5 minutes without thinking, "boy, he's a real dummy."
And this has nothing to do with his policy or anything other than his inability to articulate intelligent thought.
And maybe he can be a dummy and a good president. But he's definitely a dummy.

She was a terrible candidate. Everyone I knew didn't like either of them. And how does that demonstrate intelligence? lol. He even lost the popular vote by more than any president ever.
Every time I listen to an interview with Trump, or he gives a speech, it's clear he's an idiot. Maybe it's an old age thing and he used to be smarter? I have no idea, but his speech patterns, lack of focus, inability to articulate complete thoughts, etc, show how stupid he is. I've never heard him speak and think, "hmmmm maybe he is smart enough to be president." Every time I just cringe. It's really embarrassing.

Bitcoin is decentralized and scarce though. I'm not saying bitcoin is going to succeed, but saying bitcoin is like monopoly money or video game skins shows that you have a very shallow understanding of what bitcoin even is.

I do believe that. Trump is the proof.
You're creating a false equivalency. Becoming president does not mean someone is smart. There is no requirement to be smart to be president. There have been a ton of stupid world leaders. To become president, you just need votes. That's all there is. No intelligence test.
I base Trump's intelligence on his own actions, ideas, and statements, like I judge anyone's intelligence. And the dude is a moron.
Several members of his administration have said it too.

Also, when you think a people using twitter when they shouldn't be...  Trump is ripe for analogy.

It's crazy. That guy last night sold $25 million in bitcoin and it temporarily lowered the market cap by $11 billion. Just shows how stupid a metric market cap it.

No, it's not a test of physical strength *and* it's not a test of intelligence. It's neither. 
It's literally a popularity contest. Trump was more popular than Hillary on election night  n the right areas of the us. (Though he lost the popular vote by more than any president ever.)
If this was an intelligence test, why would we vote? Why not just test intelligence and make the winner the president.
People vote for whom they want to based on a ton of reasons. But there is no reason to believe these votes are a measure of intelligence.
Do you think that average voter is the best judge of intelligence? Do you think the average voter is voting strictly on intelligence?
The entire point you're trying to make is making you look foolish.
