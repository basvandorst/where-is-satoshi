Sports Betting.  I lost 1 BC on the Mayweather vs Canelo fight.

Did you get it back into your bank account yet?
@_date: 2013-04-26 03:48:46
I did the same thing when rumors were spreading that Bitfloor was closing down.  Went right in to withdraw, but I too was too late.
*Note:  If banks suspect you're an AML risk, they will close your account.

Great Job!  I love how you backed up your prediction with quantitative analysis.  At what price do you recommend one should set their buy order at this point in time?
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:11:27
Thanks for your review.  After Bitfloor shut down, I decided to open one at Campbx using your referral URL.
@_date: 2013-10-18 21:51:39
I might just move over from campBX

Will you explain how you got the purple line? I feel like the true price is between the green and purple line. Although, I do agree with joshnorris14 that the true price is what people are WILLING to pay for.

I completely understand where you're coming from. I bought in at 70, sold at 350, 550, 650, and 750.  Now that we're at an all time high at 4 digits, I only have a couple left. It's sounds very greedy of me but I'm regretting the fact I left a whole lot of money on the table. I too am worried that im being caught up in the delusional mania. I feel it's smart to "sell when everyone's buying" but I also can't get over the fact I may be leaving even more money on the table. What to do? What to do? 
Tldr; mo' money, mo' problems.

I like the potential of this company. I love the fact that they're aggressively pursuing their relationships in the Asian gaming industry. Bought a few thousand shares as my lottery ticket.

Is funding through DWOLLA no longer an option? That's how I funded my account. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 02:49:51
I agree with you.  I bet their bank's AML (anti-money laundering) group found them to be high risk.
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:51:37
I appreciate you shedding some color on the situation and I empathize on your increased work load. I feel this should have been communicated to your North American clients prior to the request of withdrawal. (There is still no notice of this on your website). Contrary to popular belief, bank draft are not guaranteed to have no holds and "foreign" drafts can take up to 3-8 weeks to collect. I also just learned that I was charged for a $30 fee for the check withdrawal which I read from your withdrawal instructions should be free.

I work at a bank and I too was laughed at when I started to explain what bitcoins where to a portfolio/finance manager. In front of all my colleagues, he said that was the stupidest thing he's ever heard of and wouldn't be surprised if it was a scam.  This of course was AFTER I told all my colleagues about them and that I had bought some :(

I posted this in another thread:
"I requested it [USD] 2 days ago (04/18) and still haven't received funds and I don't expect to receive it anytime soon due to their new update.
With their bank account closed, 10 days to receive the check, starting a new relationship with a new bank, having a new account check hold for 7-10 business days, and setting up ACH, I don't think we'll be receiving our USD funds for at least a month. I hope I'm wrong."

@_date: 2013-11-18 21:05:55
Agree, I would say about 5-7 business days.

Tell that to the dot-com bubble.

I too use CampBX.  The only bad thing about it is that liquidity is still fairly low so you can have wide spreads (e.g. Bid=$460 Ask= $470).  If you want a lifetime 10% discount on their commissions, you can use my affiliate link:        or you can just go straight to their website and sign up.
Edit: forgot a word.
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:23:46
What's their volume like in a 24 hour period? 
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:03:38
For the US, CampBX is great. A little low on liquidity but it's picking up. If you want to take advantage of a lifetime 10% discount on commission fees you can use my referral link  or you can just go directly to the website.
Edit: stupid autocorrect
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:28:52
I just requested an ACH withdrawal for USD just now. I'll update once I receive funds in my bank account. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:00:59
I was affected when Bitfloor shut it's doors early this year. After much pressure from the affected community, there was a window of opportunity to retrieve your money/bitcoins back a while ago. I'm surprised you're still having trouble.
@_date: 2013-05-07 05:14:05
I had the exact same problem.  Sent my 1st ticket and waited a week with no response. Updated the ticket, still no response.  Created a new ticket, still no response.  2 weeks, 4 tickets later, and multiple followup replies to their automated email, they finally resolved my issue by resetting my 2 factor authentication. 
@_date: 2013-04-26 03:30:51
How did you communicate with them?  Phone, email, or creating a ticket through the help desk?
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:11:35
This is true.  My mobile firefox stopped me from going to mt. gox due to "untrusted site"

28, Banker - Bought $1500 worth at $145 (10btc) sold all at $170 for $250 total profit.

*fist bump bro* 
I read somewhere that the moment we convince ourselves we're not in a bubble, is the moment we're definitely in a bubble.
@_date: 2013-11-25 05:17:27
That's really sad to hear.  If not CampBX, then what else can we (U.S. buyers) use?
@_date: 2013-04-27 02:31:39
I got the same message.  My fraud senses are tingling.

You're right. As a whole it has recovered but a lot of the listed companies during that era didn't survive. With the stock market you have the beauty of diversification (scattering your eggs in different baskets). BITCOIN investing is akin to investing in ONE company with a new technology. I just hope this company survives.

I requested to withdraw my USD just as trading halted.  Still haven't received it yet.  It was worth more than .5 bitcoin :(
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:37:12
Is that the output of doing a linear regression?
@_date: 2013-04-21 01:33:51
Bank account in an hour, yes. Having funds available for you to use, no. New business accounts typically go through a 30 day review period where the compliance department do their due diligence on new accounts. Things they look for range from money laundering activities, OFAC issues, reprutaional risk, etc. During this period all checks are on hold for 7-10 business days.
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:08:48
Do you guys really recommend Campbx.com? I thought my only option would be to go to Mt. Gox where at least I'm already verified after 3 weeks of waiting.
