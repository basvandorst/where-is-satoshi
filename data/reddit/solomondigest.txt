I meant after a channel has been opened. I believe after opening a channel you literally are trusting your money on someone's hard drive. I might be wrong (and I really hope so) but that's what I've gathered.

Exactly. If I've understood correctly, if you open a channel in lightning network and your channel database corrupts for whatever reason (hardware failure, node crash etc) there's no way of sending anything to the blockchain, and nothing will be in a block anyway. You'll lose your money.
Even if you run your own lightning node with backups you'd still risk losing your funds due to built-in penalty system if you happen to restore an old state. And let's face it – most people won't be running their own personal node anyway.
I'm not saying zero-conf transactions are any better, I'm merely toying with the idea of making them more secure somehow in the bitcoin protocol. After all, they're already accepted by some merchants/ATMS, they're instant and they're on the first layer. Maybe something could be built on top of that?

Any update to this? I'm currently struggling with the same issue.

To anyone having the same problem – apparently bitcoind (0.18.1) has some issues if the Tor proxy does not reside in localhost and when the automatic Onion service (with the Tor control port) method is used. There are no errors in any logs even with the debug=tor option on, but the port stays closed.
After I set up the onion service manually ([method 2]( I was able to see my port open, but **only after the node had been fully initialized** (it will take minutes after restarting)**.**
Scan the port locally from the tor proxy's host before debugging the actual Onion service.
You can scan your Onion service port by using either torsocks/torify/proxychains as discussed here: [
You can also use a Docker container to scan the port:
    docker run --rm -it milesrichardson/onion-nmap -p 8333 xxxxxxx.onion
If you get this, then you're good:
    PORT     STATE SERVICE
    8333/tcp open  bitcoin
After this leave your node on and you will eventually get incoming connections.
If the port state is closed or you get SOCKS server failures there's something wrong with your setup.
PS: Don't use bitnodes.earn.com to scan your node, it's not that reliable it seems

Thank you so much, this was a vital piece of information!
