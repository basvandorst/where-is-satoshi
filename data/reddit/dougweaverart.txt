As a college professor I ask every class if anyone has crypto. Only blank stares until a week ago when one student said that she follows the news but can’t afford to buy anything.

Well, could they hurry up and pump it?

Fake thing is the only fake thing! No other fake thing can fake thing like our fake thing because our fake thing is old, but not as old as the evil banks’ fake thing. That fake thing is too old, and this other fake think is too new. Ours is the original new fake thing!!

Are you saying that there is something inappropriate about referring to someone as male when they assume a male identity?
@_date: 2018-05-15 22:30:24
At least we can agree that this guy sucks.

I thought about that. Writing in secret on the computer has connotations to the non-BTC crowd. It goes from the feel of a creative visionary to a "money hacker."
Of course it makes no sense for Satoshi to write on paper.

Satoshi is traditionally a Japanese man's name.

Maybe, but I tend to refer to people as men when they present themselves as men. If we discover that Satoshi is a woman then the narrative will change. When women use a false persona of a man to be taken seriously, the offense is that they are not taken seriously as a woman, not that the false persona is believed.

Maybe you should take a look at my work before you judge. White male is not my default.

1. That is a computer Monitor, which will backlight the image and work as a sort of halo and obscure him a bit.
2. Agreed, face should be obstructed.
3. I like him looking the viewer in the eye, because he is confrontational(taking on the banking system). I can angle his head in the painting, but like him looking us in the eye.
4. Do you think it would be better if there were other people in the scene? in the background/obstructed? Implying more that there is a primary person, but working with a team?
Thank you for your thorough assessment.

It’s possible to keep it nebulous and androgynous. This really helps. Thanks.

We’ve been married 10 years and going strong. A little familial conspiracy theory is nothing!

I know, right? With all those shady symbols on it.

Noob here. Why is BCH silver?
@_date: 2018-04-12 19:17:17
If you always HODL, then wouldn’t you buy at every dip? Why would you ever buy the pump? I’m confused. I just shorted the coin I use to trade, and left alone the wallet I use to HODL. I will buy the dump, as is logical.
