It's a perfectly fair analogy. As I stated in another post, the history and intentions of Blockstream don't really matter, WhatsApp started out well intentioned too. False dichotomies are the scapegoat of the weak minded as well, so what does that make you? If Blockstream wants experts to work on their project fine, the company and those they hire are free to do as they wish, but it's valid to point out the conflict of interest that exists if they continue to also work on the protocol which is supposedly being developed independently.
If I'm building an independent railroad for all to use, technologically agnostic, and someone hires me to develop a solar powered train, do you not think I'll have a bias when it comes time to route the rail system through a tunnel which would make solar powered trains more difficult? I can pretend to be unbiased, but if my paycheck comes from the solar powered train project and not from the railroad project, which can be routed more quickly through a tunnel, do you really expect outside parties to believe I'm acting without bias?

Come on man, you don't have to suck their dicks. They're smart folks, sure, and they've done a lot for Bitcoin, but just because they're experts doesn't mean they don't have biases. You're not doing anyone any favours by blindly defending them. The average redditor, be it here or is an idiot, and treating this like a Superbowl, where only one team can win, is going to be the downfall of us all.

Well you're certainly allowed to have you own opinion and be assuaged according to your own standards, but I'm just as concerned by a commercially backed army of developers as I am by a group of supposedly independent lobbyists who were formerly employed by Verizon, Goldman Sachs, etc. I'm actually more concerned with the situation here, because unlike the obvious conflicts of interest in banking and telecom, where someone moves from working in the industry being regulated, to trying to regulate the industry, we have here a situation where developers have direct influence over the protocol while simultaneously working on a commercial venture that utilizes the supposedly independently developed protocol.  Wlad, as smart as he may be, doesn't really strike me as a particulary strong leader either, certainly not someone whom I feel could resist the powerful influence of the team Blockstream has assembled.

You may have gotten lucky in the past and broadcast a transaction within a minute of a new block being found, but the average block time is and always has been 10 minutes, it's in the code itself, and this is what difficulty is based off of. Before you go posting bullshit on a forum of a quarter-million people, maybe do your fucking homework. Just imagine if every moron on this sub posted their misinformed bullshit, making shitpost after shitpost...this sub would be even more unbearable than it already is.

If you want to invest, do your own fucking homework -- asking what other people would do doesn't count. If you invest in anything...property, crypto, equities...based on the opinions of a subreddit frequented by children as much if not more so than savvy investors, you will lose money, and deservedly so.

It's perfectly fair to question the motives of Blockstream, and regardless, it's concerning to have a single company in such a powerful position, funding such a large percentage of developers. If J.P. Morgan Chase started funding development, influencing direction, would you not question it? Would a well articulated press release assuage your concerns?

You're nothing more than a different strain of cancer as far as reddit is concerned. Know why we have a fork right now? Because people like you think people with differing opinions should be silenced. You want those who don't think like you to be banned from voicing their concerns. Sure, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of troll accounts, but they exist on both sides. The age of an account isn't representative of the person behind the account. Do you realize how vicious and vindictive some of the assholes on reddit are? Again, both sides are at fault, and I don't blame a lot of people for wanting to participate in a semi-anonymous fashion, I know I don't want to be harassed on a personal level for my sincere opinions.

The issue isn't segwit, it's the centralization of development and the conflict of interests between Blockstream and the supposedly decentralized development of Bitcoin. Like I said, no one is without bias, but when a substantial percentage of those with direct influence over development share the same bias, then it negatively affects the integrity of the Bitcoin protocol. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 03:34:49
For starters, you can spin information that is technically correct to fit a narrative without ever telling a lie. The news does it, everyone does it. It's nothing personal against Blockstream, it's just one of the realities of being human. We all have biases. 
I respect a lot of the folks at Blockstream; I am for SegWit, I am for Lightning. But...
If you try to look at this objectively, it's hard to defend the fact that there is some conflict of interest here. One company having that much influence over the direction core takes just doesn't align with the decentralized ethos of Bitcoin. They can put out press releases like this and make statements to appease critics, but look at WhatsApp, for example; they started out with user's interests at heart, e2e encryption, privacy-focused, etc, but then Facebook bought them out and that all changed. 
It's easy to build up a company based on good intentions, but centralizing funding and development is a dangerous precedent to set. 
Blockstream's good intentions and the direction of Bitcoin shouldn't depend on the potentially empty promises of a commercial enterprise. 
Developers need to pay the bills too, so I understand why Blockstream exists, but it's become a bit of a clique, and when it comes to something like the 2MB blocksize, they've abused their position by refusing to show any good will. Bitcoin isn't going to break by raising blocks to 2MB; 1MB was arbitrarily set to begin with. And even if the blocks have been artificially full, all rasing the limit does is make that fuckery more expensive, while lowering fees for the actual userbase. 8MB, 32MB, etc...I can see valid short term concerns over these limits, the barrier to entry would be substantially raised if that's what we'd been dealing with for the past few years. 
I'm still ambivalent towards Blockstream, but this 2MB issue is going to be my line in the sand.

Go find another subreddit, you cunt. I'm not selling anything, I'm refusing to buy your idiotic bullshit. You're the one knocking on door looking for help because you're too fucking dumb to come to any conclusions on your own. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 04:05:12
Exactly, you want the path of least resistance. Understanding takes time, time which you'd rather not invest and instead you want others to form an opinion for you. You're left of the curve, you're the type that others prey on. You and your mentality will always be on the losing end. You're prey, nothing more.

Being biased and being an expert aren't mutually exclusive. If you can't accept that, you're not worth talking to.

Bingo! The guy is a total moron. Not everyone has to be a software engineer, but at least bring something of value to the table. It's so obvious this clown wants to feel important and relevant, but there is no reason whatsoever his opinion should matter to anyone who isn't his mother.
