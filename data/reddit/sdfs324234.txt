yea.. this is the other problem with these debates, if we cant' even agree on the facts :)
@_date: 2017-08-19 01:57:50
Hmm.. so cylindrical maybe? 
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:17:05
it really doesn't
@_date: 2017-08-20 22:06:31
I dont think so. It has been possible to deposit GBP by debit card for a while.. just that there's no way to withdraw it.. or deposit without the extortionate card fee. They used to allow GBP withdrawals and bank deposits but at some point their UK banking was cut off (like every other exchange that's ever tried). I expect it'll be back eventually..
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:07:45
I expect it may happen.. but that isn't really the point, the point is that the original btc (ie, 1MB + segwit) will still be the only bitcoin that matters.
@_date: 2017-08-06 23:34:14
I think the best solution would be for the Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan to reserve the BTC code for bitcoin.. they can't realistically use it for anything else at this point.
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:02:15
I'm guessing you can withdraw any amount via the Japanese bank SWIFT wire method.. of course the fees will suck.
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:29:23
maybe next time don't use the word bitcoin or cryptocurrency.. not saying you should lie, just express it in more ambiguous terms like investment or something.

There may be [cash deposit]( at a bank options. ~~Or you could try and get [parental consent]( to use coinbase.~~ edit: apparently there's no parental consent option now.

fair point about the time.. that is interesting.. the question i suppose is, does it actually take 12hrs when you book it.. or is there a headwind that delays it by another few hrs.. or they just say sorry and transfer you to another flight that stops off somewhere. The planes could also be flying faster than normal.. I found a website that claims to rate flights on historical performance flightstats.com.. that one in particular Quantas 28 has a 0% rating.. which seems a bit odd. The other direction Quantas 27 has a 0.1% rating.. although the claimed average delay is only 1hr isn't enough to make a difference.

That just isn't the case.. it's far too complicated to prove one way or another in a reddit discussion.. there are a lot of aspects too this.. but certainly gps can be implemented on a flat earth.. most gps stations are not even on statellites in the official narrative.. they are ground based often colocated with cell towers.. you can actually buy one on ebay and run it yourself although that may be illegal. Coordinate systems can be mapped onto any shape you want.. just as we can have flat maps and globes you can have your position mapped onto a sphere.. regardless of the underlying reality.
edit: with specific regard to cultural_dissenter's point, he is wrong because you can fake the timestamp on the gps packet.. the receiver knows it's local time and looks at the time on the gps packet to determine how far away the satellite is.. simply by backdating the timestamps you can make it look like the source is further away than it is .. I guess this may not be very convincing as on the surface it might seem difficult to coordinate that kind of lie across a number of different transmitters but it's possible (would actually be easier with a large number of localised transmitters) and is likely to be one of the tricks being employed. 
A simple analogy would be stereo headphones and their ability to make it sound as if a sound is far off in some direction while really it is directly in your ear.. in the case of gps there aren't two ears, just one onnidirectional one and the time deltas between  self declared timestamp and the local one. So a single transmission station sitting say right next to the receiver could simulate an entire galaxy of satellites at whatever arbitrary positions it wants too.

I generally buy some every paycheck.

Is there any block re-transmission, or if you miss one are you SOL? Doesn't sound enormously useful tbh.. at best it would maybe lower the bandwidth usage of a 3g/4g connected device.. not replace the 3g/4g.. and I mean you could just run a light wallet instead.
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:27:18
It's just a model... both are probably wrong at some level. I think the flat earth is useful to realise just how full of shit the mainstream view is.. and indeed just how many lies are accepted without question. Flights in the southern hemisphere are indeed particularly informative.

It's not 64kbit/s, they are transmitting the last 144 blocks every 10min (to allow people to catch up if they miss some blocks). It's about 4megabits per second.
	You have: 144 * 2 megabytes per 10min
	You want: megabits per second
	* 3.84
@_date: 2017-08-16 21:58:01
you may think you're not but actually you are.
@_date: 2017-08-21 02:08:45
It could force everyone to use LN.. at least between the main exchanges there's no reason they can't have instant LN payments up and running before segwit2x comes into play.. then everyone will have instant transactions no matter how slow the blocks are.
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:37:11
none.. firstly there really aren't many that take cards at all.. and even coinbase is like 3% extra for cards, but others are like 5-8%.. it's a ripoff.. use a bank account.. if you don't want to link your main bank account, open another bank account somewhere.. possibly at a local credit union.

Get an account with fire.com and revolut.com then transfer GBP to revolut and from there transfer EUR to fire and then transfer EUR from fire to kraken or bitstamp. Total fees for the process can be &lt;0.5% and it can take less than 1 day if you start when the banks open in the am.. although more likely next day.
@_date: 2017-08-14 01:47:29
of course
@_date: 2017-08-05 04:45:41
withdraw it to your bank account and then buy it using a bank transfer :p
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:00:16
can you elaborate? does that mean if you start listening now you'll get everything up to 24hrs ago?
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:31:29
true, but what could happen very quickly is intra-exchange ln transfers.. which probably comprise the majority of payments anyway.

too bad there's no bch deposits yet.

alternate way to distribute radio signals without satellites.

There are counter arguments for everything.. I don't see anything new or even particularly interesting there.
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:47:06
I'm not sure which particular comment you're referring too there? If you mean the Chile to Australia flight thing.. that's been pretty well answered by the flat earth model... it actually explains the flight paths better in that they basically always get routed through the 'northern hemisphere' rather than going directly.
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:24:27
most of them do.. aside from your specific example of Chile to Australia I don't think there are any other direct flights.. they all stop off somewhere in the northern hemisphere. The Chile ones probably just fly a similar route as if they were going through LAX except don't stop off there.. those flights only started happening recently as planes weren't able to fly the whole distance non-stop before.
