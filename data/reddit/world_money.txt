Centralized monetary system demonstrates, yet again, one of the many reasons why it is flawed.
Highly related to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-09 13:19:59
Poor example. Libra isn't centralized because of its small number of miners. It's centralized because every aspect of it from the ground up is dictated by facebook, and then by extension the US government.
You cannot apply this same logic to Bitcoin unless you're saying that the handful of mining pools currently "governing" Bitcoin at 1mb means it is centralized.

Implying that Bitcoin is something the wealthy buy as status symbol? I'm saddened that the vision of BTC has boiled down to lambos and ATH's instead of economic sovereignty for the people that need it most.
Clearly OP is a newbie to the space and hasn't learned the basics. The first ideas he is introduced to about Bitcoin shouldn't be "buy this flashy thing it's for wealthy people" or "it's a store of value". The economic implications of Bitcoin in 3rd world nation's should be the focus while educating new people.

- Rewards, like cash back.
- Decentralized recurring payments
- Consistently low fees
- Non-custodial escrow
- Faster fiat-to-crypto conversion
- Reclassification from a property to a currency so that people are not discouraged from spending. Taxes in the USA are currently quite harsh on crypto. (I realize this is not a technical problem but it is a huge barrier for adoption.)

Why would it be centralized of hundreds of big companies and governments would be competing for hashpower? Even now the BTC hash is mostly decided between huge pools all controlled by a handful of companies, but Bitcoin mining is clearly decentralized.

Where I live electricity is $0.11/kWh. Running a full node makes me less than $20 per month.
The cost far outweighs the profit. People are saying that the fees will get *lower*? This economic model is not sustainable for the average Joe. The only way this makes sense is if I become a well connected node with tens to hundreds of BTC locked in channels to provide the network liquidity.
@_date: 2019-07-09 13:15:10

For noobs: DCA stands for Dollar Cost Average, where you buy a fixed amount on a fixed schedule over the course of several months/years.
On a personal note, I wish exchanges would encourage people to DCA. Drops wouldn't significantly impact most people's investments and so less people would panic sell. Less people panic selling would make corrections more mild.

LN doesn't even have 100k worth of BTC on it currently. Billions are sent on the blockchain, very little is sent on Lightning.
@_date: 2019-07-20 19:25:34
We've had all of the components to make a blockchain since the launch of the internet. For some reason it took a while for someone to put all of the pieces together. Imagine where we would be if Satoshi had been inspired to release Bitcoin 10 years earlier than it was?

How would I go about sending $5 via Lightning to 10 strangers in person?
@_date: 2019-07-18 12:38:22
How do you know fees will get lower as LN scales? Currently you call them high but I seriously doubt most running a node are profitable.
LN is experimental and we don't know what the network topology or average fee will be at scale. Current topology is hub and spoke - lots of little nodes connected to a few big nodes who provide liquidity to minimize hops. Current fees aren't enough to cover node electricity costs and may rise as network traffic rises.

Yes I recognize the comparison of fake and real rolexes. You also highlighted Bitcoin as an asset that rich people glorify, similar to the lambo memes.
You could have picked a metaphor that just compared one asset to a knock off asset. But you chose (consciously or not) a metaphor with a second meaning. I think it's very telling to know the feeling towards Bitcoin has changed since it's inception. People who have been around here a while will recognize this shift, new folks will likely not.

The qualities of good money include storing value AND functioning as a medium of exchange.
Bitcoin is a poor medium of exchange when fees are high and transaction times take hours. Imagine every time you paid in fiat cash you lost $2-$4 of your money as you pass it to a merchant.
Now imagine using your "medium of exchange" with $50 fees, like Bitcoin had in 2017.
Bitcoin is currently a terrible medium of exchange.

Bitcoin was created to eliminate trust in third parties. Stable coins have their uses but they rely on the trust of the fiat they are tethered to *and* the companies claiming to redeem the coins at a 1to1 ratio.
Too much trust is required, in my opinion, so I do not use stablecoins.

@_date: 2019-06-06 20:39:06
So here's the scenario:
-Fees for next block are $20.
-You open a channel with outbound liquidity of $80.
-Total cost is $100.
-Actual available to spend is only $60 assuming blockchain fees don't vary because you still need $20 to close the channel.
-The channel is with Starbucks so there will be no liquidity moving in your direction.
Now with all that in mind you can make unlimited transactions with your channel as long as you don't exceed your $60 one-way limit. Does the word "unlimited" have any real value to you in this scenario? 
The only way "unlimited outbound capacity" matters is if you open a channel with a centralized hub AND you're receiving payments at an equal rate that you are making them. For most people neither of those factors is appealing.

On chain fees are steadily rising. We could all get txs in for a few pennies early in the year but that opportunity has passed. If things continue like in 2017, fees will be $30+ when BTC is near $20k again. How will we then advertise BTC to people looking to circumvent cc fees?

When a channel is created it is posted to the blockchain. All transactions between you and the other end of the channel are not on the blockchain. Then the channel is closed and the balanced settled again on the blockchain.
Everything that happens between you and the other node is private, we just established this above. These transactions are not stored on a public ledger.

BTC fees are guaranteed to rise if usage continues rising. This means new users who didn't open channels back when they were only pennies are now punished for being late to the game.
