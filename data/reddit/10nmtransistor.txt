Its like your postman saying please use postal services instead of email. They are insisting not to register with email service providers as they could get hacked n cannot be trusted and instead take a print of your composed email and use their service..

Agree with expensive tools because I myself am a DFT engineer and know about it. What's your point here? Even TSMC does it for Bitmain with better yield.

Only ASIC is being manufactured by Samsung IC fab. Complete system will be developed by engineers from it's customer company. Many fabless semiconductor design companies use Samsung fab for their products.
@_date: 2018-01-27 12:20:11
Agree. Just wanted OP to get a feel of it on testnet.
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:06:43
Samsung engineers will never know how ASICS work functionally(unless they have done the front end design which is highly unlikely). They will have access to physical design implementation though.

Misleading actually. Some company is using Samsung ASIC fab for silicon bringup just like tsmc does.

IMHO, when new people realise that they are losing big on shitcoins they will flock into Bitcoin. And also LN.

Not recommended. The change coins will be lost.

I would say donate half for a cause and the rest for developing the Bitcoin ecosystem. The former will just sell the btc and get fiat for spending while the latter will help improve the adoption.

There will be a wave, once ETF gets approved.. most HODLers will try to sell for immediate profits, price go down, then the price will again take off. You can go in 50% now and then find a sweet spot, then go in the other 50%. This is my feeling

@_date: 2017-02-27 06:17:06
HODLing increases the value. In a way, increase in price helps early adopters who helped spread the word. It is like an incentive or Karma for all the efforts n risks taken. bitcoin being a payment system, is already serving its purpose. I dont see any problem.

Where does the community wants to see Bitcoin in 5 years? I have made a list of categories, can people comment on what industry is doing to work towards each?
1. Adoption
2. Price
3. Privacy
4. Decentralization
Have we achieved all of the required goals or still far behind?

We are all here for the same purpose my friend. We all want to change our lives. Just have a little faith and trust this innovative open ledger system. Remember this and 5 years from now, you will owe me a cup of coffee(I don't take alcohol) :)
@_date: 2017-03-14 05:02:21
Looks like Bitcoin doesn't give a fuck about the HF(based on its current price). Will people delete their facebook accounts if they migrate to a different server? Thats just it. People will use it, HODL it no matter what happens to its blockchain as far as the trustless factor is considered. 
My opinion, lets not HF and fuck up the base security, lets develop layers of utility over it. 
I'm afraid that if now there will be a HF for block size, what's the guarantee that miners wont create a HF to raise the block rewards in future?
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:59:07
Not at all. Covert AB was something which people were frowned upon. It is freely being used on BCH and nobody has a problem at all. Again it's a free market u know..

@_date: 2017-08-06 05:03:15
As far as consensus on features are reached in an openly discussed way and solutions are open source, I don't think there's any problem.

Ideally FINCEN should come into picture if there are centralised forks like what ViaBTC did with Bcash. Without consensus, forcing a fork is just a way to make money without any real utilities.

@_date: 2017-08-27 08:35:23
Segwit 2x sucks because of what following reason? 1. Results in multiple chain 2. Centralisation 3. Loss of confidence in value because miners have control over consensus decision. 4. All of the above

@_date: 2017-08-08 06:33:32
It will reduce by an offset. Not a permanent solution. Although we have LN as 2nd layer permanent solution, we will need to use base layer as settlement where fees will be high but low considering the no. Of participants in a channel. Somebody can correct me if I'm wrong.

I'd prefer buying a car on EMI. In that way, probability of BTC going higher is more than u paying higher interest.
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:31:05
I'm planning to buy my first car but not by selling BTC. I have figured out a strategy of paying mortgage EMI but invest an extra part into BTC. Since in my country, interest rate for car mortgage is very high like around 10% I want to compensate by investing extra into BTC.. In that way, whatever interest I pay will hopefully get nullified by BTC investment. I call it BEMI- bitcoin EMI. What do u guys think?

Neither, we are on the way to moon

Good to know. Will you please ask if there are plans to bring mining industry and decentralise the hashing power?
@_date: 2016-12-13 07:54:33
zebpay.. u can download the app and check the current price, its around 57k. But as Andreas says "Its not your money unless you control the private keys", I took his advice and purchased a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-01-31 10:59:03
loved the read!
@_date: 2016-12-08 12:13:19
Zebpay or unocoin! Declare capital gains when u sell.. unsure though
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:12:23
Sellers listen to this guy. If you want to buy a car, get a loan and don't sell BTC.

Bitcoin is working as intended even if the development stalls. Apart from security patches normal person who uses bitcoin for its typical utility would continue using it without any problem. A normal PC user demands apps for his OS, not an upgrade, if it's not for the security reasons.

Good luck, it is because of people like you we hodlers can sleep peacefully for decentralizing the network.

I use their own app and also used mycelium on Android.. but after segwit, switched only to their own app coz mycelium doesn't support segwit tx.

Coz bitcoin tx are saved on blockchain that is open to public and same valid copy is maintained by all nodes.
@_date: 2017-04-28 08:38:00
linear blocksize wont help because the growth in adoption will be expected to be exponential. Hence we will need an offchain solution for micro/small txes.

Thats right,  1st things 1st.
@_date: 2017-04-07 09:22:42
this is fine, BITMAIN must show that they are clean if they really are.
@_date: 2017-04-29 05:59:48
You clearly do not understand the tech and argue without any base. Go understand it and then discuss.
@_date: 2017-04-07 10:56:49
I think time becomes space in a blackhole, so every timestamp tx on a blockchain is a beautiful piece of art in a blackhole.

Just register with an exchange and provide valid proof. It is not illegal in India now to buy bitcoin since most exchanges like zebpay are registered companies. You can read the following 
Edit: yes I've invested and I'm from India. Buy responsibly and pay your taxes
@_date: 2018-03-13 12:31:57
Agree, but I'm looking for a metric. How do you measure adoption and what should be the ideal comparison parameters for different cryptocurrencies?

I am telling. Sorry for the wrong punctuation. I believe features or changes are a part of consensus, same way how bcash was born.
@_date: 2018-03-13 12:28:27
Is there a better metric to define performance of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:28:00
Actually that kinda makes sense. Directly analogous to living costs. The better the city has facilities like metro, the more tax you pay. Yet people want to move in to such cities. just sayin.

Because I know if there's a fork, I'll have 2 coins /s
@_date: 2018-03-13 12:55:15
Again, that's an ideal scenario. People trade their shitcoin not only with BTC as a pair. We need a correct way to describe how important btc is in terms of numbers. Currently, I only see market cap as a simplest but deceptive parameter. Exchanges need to come up with something better.
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:56:17
And they can't even spell words correctly in about us section. Makes me puke reading about it.

So you agree there's a choice and BCH to make a comeback.. That's a good thing. Even I agree that having a competitive coin is healthy, but instead you want to force the so called "upgradation" on chain that has majority of hashrate not caring about users who also falls under the no2x category.. that's unfair. So about the segwit, you say that fee discount is entirely artificial. Why do you even want it in the 1st place in the B2X upgradation?

What a piece of shit.
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:23:20
Who are these most users and why did they stick to BTC even though they had a choice to swith to BCH? So given a scenario where BTC and BCH exists as a choice for miners and businesses to switch easily, they still mine and use the native chain. If the real question was about the urgent upgradation, why segwit adoption is still at 13%? I'm curious.. :/

No problem newbie. The Bitcoin network is dumb to understand if the tx is being made to a hardware device and that holds good if the tx is being made by a bot or an AI. A tx fees is a must if you want it to go through due to limited block space and to avoid spam tx over the network. The bitcoins you buy is not yours until you hold the private keys hence a hardware wallet is the best and secure way to store your coins because the private keys never leave the device. My suggestion to you is to buy a nano S and move all the coins to HW wallet if you are a long term HODLer. Cheers!

From what I hear asic boost saves 20% electricity.. but don't you think that 2mb base block size increase will cost them more due to centralised miners with higher hashrate? Why do small miners don't realise this and be against it? Are they being fooled by nya or segwit2x?
Edit: are they being fooled thinking that TX fees would profit them more?
@_date: 2017-06-25 09:33:10
Came here to ask same question.
@_date: 2017-06-21 17:22:43
God, I love this community :)
@_date: 2017-06-23 15:38:19
If miners lose revenue because of slow block propagation with increased block size, why are all miners supporting non segwit base block size increase? I mean to say, this is advantageous for miners with large hash rate but why are small miners supporting non segwit plain block size increase?
@_date: 2017-06-29 06:30:12
Centralised morons.

CNBC selling snake oil to public? Why don't u tell about the recent Ethereum blockchain size flippening as well?
@_date: 2017-06-08 12:14:04
You dont have to do this. If your lungs need oxygen, it doesnt mean that other gases does not enter. Keep the bitcoin for larger monthly spends and use fiat for day today spends. DO remember that Bitcoin has so much value because of fiat's unlimited supply.

money or currency?
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:05:52
I find this statement reasonable. But don't you think that the channels may​ become a sort of mesh network which may never be needed to close? For example, all exchanges can have a dedicated channel among miners and can bid for bitcoins(I actually kind of like this idea and will be awesome if bidding can be done using automated scripts), amazon can have it's channel with wallet providers like mycelium and users can seamlessly make tx with a little trust and is never needed to be closed?

I'm talking about miners who are not so centralised like antpool. There are other miners who are supposed to be against block size increase logically thinking.. but I see other way round. Can any miner clarify this?

1. There is only pow based timestaping system, no blockchain and stop using it in a wrong way.
2. Ask whether they are interested in Bitcoin or a database system.
3. Stop making shitty laws that makes Bitcoin startups move out of the states.
4.Stop hyping about Ethereum, it's not a cryptocurrency. It's a platform for distribution computation and not a store of value.
5. Ask them to make up their mind, are they interested in monetary application of blockchain, if yes Bitcoin is the best we have.
6. Start mining.

a)Whether Virtual Currencies (VCs) should be banned, regulated or observed? - doesn't matter at all because underground economy is already formed.
b) In case VCs are suggested to be regulated: 
i). What measures should be taken to ensure consumer protection? 
Impossible by Bitcoin's design, may be strict KYC @ exchanges would work.
ii). What measures should be taken to promote orderly development of VCs.
Start using Bitcoin instead of payment processors like visa
 iii). Which appropriate institution(s) should monitor/ regulate the VCs?
New team with expertise in IT/finance
c). In case VCs are not suggested to be regulated:
i). What should be the effective self-regulatory mechanism? 
ii). What measures should be adopted to ensure consumer protection in this scenario? 
Maybe government start mining/buying bitcoin
