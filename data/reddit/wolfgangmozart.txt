With the exception of Steve Jobs generally speaking I agree.

Bitcoin is unaffected.

Downvoted into oblivion? No, you asked a very good question, I have wondered the same thing.

You resemble that comment.

Is it possible that bitcoin will be the investment crypto standard and another crypto currency will become a transaction standard?
It seems like there are many possibilities coming up the road.
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:56:42
And if you care for them properly they will multiply over time.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:49:53
Ahhhh perspective.
@_date: 2013-03-22 02:29:40
Thanks I'm on an Android tablet (Bacon Reader for Reddit). and I guess there was some foulup with the linking process to the youtube app.
I had a nagging feeling that I should test it on an ordinary browser before commenting but that would have took precious time away from bitcoin research :-)
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:23:41
I was vote  %66 said yes.
@_date: 2013-04-24 01:46:47
That's great news. I will definitely buy a few books.
@_date: 2013-04-28 14:42:39
CA Virtex and Liberty are still chugging along no?
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:53:08
I can vouch for CA Virtex, service and security are decent.
If you have some issue or question that is not covered on the site FAQ the response is quick and friendly.
Just bought 58 coins 2 weeks ago.
Now I have to wait for until payday to buy a few more.
@_date: 2013-04-05 04:19:05
I guess they don't have enough on their plate.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:12:49
THANK YOU! That comment is refreshing to hear after witnessing all the fearful, weak-kneed vascillators whine and panic. Not too mention all the trolls saying this is the end of bitcoin. The protocol and the people behind it are solid, quit panicking people and move forward like an icebreaker.
@_date: 2013-03-22 03:49:50
Careful to not feed the trolls too much. It gives them energy and satisfaction.
@_date: 2013-03-28 19:11:37
Thanks for informative response. I read a lot about this stuff but I am still getting my head wrapped around some of the concepts.

Ohhhh the media loves drama.
@_date: 2013-03-21 02:51:42
Yikes the comment section after that article is full of breathtaking ignorance.
People need to be educated!
@_date: 2013-05-18 15:48:26
Done, 0.10 bitcoins donated.
@_date: 2013-04-17 01:30:33
Headless chickens, all of them.
@_date: 2013-04-17 01:52:48
I know right? They could choose to interview Gavin Andresen and get the real goods orrrr they can ask Amir.
Makes you wonder about their intentions.
I think with news making, nothing is random. There has to be a spin on almost everything.

NSA = Eye of Sauron
Redditors, let's throw the fucking ring in the volcano.
@_date: 2013-07-19 06:33:33
This is okay. It gives Gavin and Co. more time to firm up the code so when Bitcoin hits the big time, it can actually fly without crashing and burning. Just stoke that fire gently and wait for it...
Also, it gives us more time to buy more coinage.
@_date: 2013-06-26 02:12:57
Reading the first two paragraphs I thought it was an Onion article until I double checked.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:20:47
Nothing like a good crash to generate publicity and interest.
@_date: 2013-04-06 03:01:32
If Ubuntu  published a bitcoin address on their website I would donate in a heartbeat.
@_date: 2013-04-26 14:58:29
Yuh did good son, yuh did good.
@_date: 2013-04-17 01:57:22
Yes absolutely I think every budding bitcoin enthusiast should make that donation their first transaction.
It is one of THE most important investments if you think about it.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:53:17
The ignorance is ... breathtaking.
@_date: 2013-03-24 08:53:23
Sage advice.
@_date: 2013-08-01 20:52:02
Could somebody else write a piece for the New York Times?
The disinfo/ignorance is breathtaking.
Maybe someone like Gavin Andresen or Erik Voorhees or Trace Mayer...
@_date: 2013-04-24 00:26:47
I wish it would rise  slowly.
When it rises quickly you have to endure all the bitcoin ignorance  in all the news media stories that we read.
I want bitcoin to be a slowly rising giant.
@_date: 2013-08-14 04:49:13
This is what I like about reddit.
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-04-04 04:09:50
It is definitely the early days still.
The general populace is still unaware of this phenomena.
Go west young man!
@_date: 2013-04-03 00:28:56
Don't think so. The open source protocol(s) is out of  the bag and is very useful.
I have read that it could be applied to voting systems as well.
Interesting times we live in.
I also think that trying to ban it would like be like trying to ban the invention of the wheel or telephone. Kind of stupid and backwards.
@_date: 2013-03-12 04:56:03
Exactly, lessons will be learned here and we will move on a little wiser.
@_date: 2013-04-28 15:57:18
Yes and I just moved money to them through my credit union.

The second I see the word tulips I know ... I know, that the person has no idea or knowledge about bitcoin. It's like people in 1995 calling the internet a bunch of glorified fax machines and that it will never catch on.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:47:16
The bitcoin I cashed out was to recoup 2/3 of my investment.
I am holding the rest (50 coins savings and 5 coins spending) because of my understanding of the protocol and my opinion of the people working on the protocol.
The last time I had a raging hunch to invest was when Google and Apple were at less than a $100 a share.
I believe this is the real deal and we mustn't get all dramatic about one day corrections.
Keep on keep on ...
@_date: 2013-04-06 03:11:23
I use them and generally speaking I am very satisfied.
Security seems pretty high which is paramount.
For instance if I try to log in from another location I will be blocked and Virtex will send a browser verification email to me.
Also they say they keep %80 of all your bitcoins  in cold storage (offline) which increases security.
Wiring cash takes one day and bank transfers have taken 1-5 days for me.
I have emailed them to clarify something regarding my account they respond quickly and helpfully.
Yes their fees are high but I don't mind because the security and service is very good.

Yup, back on the horse again and up the mountain we go.
@_date: 2013-06-13 03:27:41
That's a really good point. M-Pesa is big in Kenya.
@_date: 2013-04-04 05:21:44
Ca virtex also keeps %80 of their/your bitcoins offline in cold storage.
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:57:00
Yup, they are trying to create a perception in hopes of creating a reality.
@_date: 2013-05-06 19:08:29

Stay calm, be brave, wait for the signs.

It just did and now it is carrying on.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:31:11
I bought in  at $45 (mid March 2013) so I am breathing easy.
It will rise again.
@_date: 2013-08-14 04:38:33
On a side note can someone tell me where the transaction fees go to?
@_date: 2013-03-26 05:50:58
If you have gmail you can configure a google alert for bitcoin stories on the web.
Every day I get a minimum of 6-8 stories emailed to me.
@_date: 2013-03-31 16:54:11
I like that the fact you have the name Neo in your public address.

@_date: 2013-03-28 04:14:20
People keep mentioning the possibility of a rogue miner(s).
Would it be possible to "certify" miners in the future? Kind of like a Linux repository of packages?
I'm no expert, just my 2 cents.
@_date: 2013-04-25 19:28:26
... are choking "American" bitcoin entrepreneurs.  
Fincen might screw up America's participation in an innovative technology.
Who benefits?

Ummmm organic farmer here. I have plenty of bitcoins and am fully on board. Just a regular guy ... really.
Also, there are  more kinds of people in this world than left wing and right wing.
Who thinks like that?

Oh the fear ... and misunderstanding.
