My imagined ideal crypto currency would involve a mining difficulty that adjusts based on the total transaction volume. If total transaction volume is high, then the difficulty increases to curb the mining of coins. High transaction volume would presumably indicate a health economy where people are exchanging the currency for goods and services. If total transaction volume is low, then the difficulty falls to introduce new coins into the market and influence those who hold the coins to spend them.
However, there are lots of implementation details that make this challenging - how do you know if a transaction wasn't just somebody moving money between wallets? It would be easy to manipulate the inflation rate this way if you had a lot of coins. Also, how do you get the currency through the startup phase where people will inevitably horde coins due to their inability to spend them?

The problem is when the deflation rate exceeds the market rate of the loan. Let's say the rate for the loan should be 3% in real terms based on your credit score, length of the loan, etc., but deflation is 4%. You're going to have to pay some "real" interest rate that is greater than 4% in order for the bank to make money. Meaning you're going to have to pay more for your loan.

There's nothing wrong with prices falling per se - when they fall in isolation from the currency, that means we are producing the same amount of wealth with less inputs, which is great! However, deflation due to the currency is generally consider a Bad Thing(TM) by both Keynesians and Austrians alike - it encourages people to horde cash rather than invest it in worthwhile ventures or real assets with real world value. Currency isn't inherently valuable. It's simply meant to grease the tubes of economic activity.
It's easy to misinterpret money kept in the bank as an example of hording cash, but that is just that - a misinterpretation. When you put your money in the bank, the bank then (presumably) lends that money out to somebody else. Hence, the currency isn't being wasted - it's in active pursuit of goods and wealth-generating investments.
I worry that should Bitcoin become the standard that we'll run into issues with this in the long run due to it being deflationary. It is possible that similar institutions as banks emerge with the same business model, but if a bank were to lend out Bitcoins, they would have to be able to collect an interest rate on it as well in order for the investment to be worthwhile. The real value of the interest rate charged has to exceed the deflation rate in order to make loaning the bitcoin worthwhile.

As cool as that would be, I would think that campaign finance laws would make things more difficult than just sending coins to an address. I know that finance laws have been made more lax as of late, but isn't there still some level of accounting and disclosure that has to take place that would require them to immediately refund any coins if they don't go through a channel that properly records the donor?

It might have something to do with the block chain being downloaded serially in Bitcoin qt. A torrent can be downloaded in any order.

You shouldn't really run a full node unless your machine is on 24/7.

I was really confused about what a cunt roll was.

Other comments were saying that a feature was being implemented so that all of the headers would be downloaded first (I'm guessing still serially) and the actual blocks could then be downloaded in any order. I'm guessing the client pretty much has to download the headers serially still in order for the distributed nature to continue working. Serial downloading of the blockchain probably makes it easier for the client to check that nobody is bullshitting them with an incorrect version of the blockchain.Torrents have no reservations about this - you're trusting that the originally distributed chain is indeed correct.

If you sufficiently encrypt it, the wallet.dat could be shared with everyone on Earth, no?

That doesn't fix the problem. You're still incentivized to keep your wealth in the high value, deflationary currency rather than engaged in pursuit of new wealth generating activities. One of the problems with a deflationary currency, at least the way I see it, is that no individual actor has incentive to use an inflationary currency instead, even if it causes economic contractions overall.

I had to check the price because I knew there was no way this would be posted if anything good was happening with the price. Down to $230 dammit.

The problems with deflationary currencies have nothing to do with divisibility. In a gold-backed currency, you can always issue notes that entitle you to a smaller share of gold.
The problems come with the incentives it creates - namely to hoard currency, which has no inherent value, rather than lend it out or invest it in wealth generating ventures.

The only reason great artists sign record label deals is because they feel bad for them, dah. Time to cut the umbilical cord. /s

You'll always have to move it through some physical medium and the transfer will always require some amount of resources.
