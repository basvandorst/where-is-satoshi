I’m not gonna start naming alts, as the bitcoin sub isn’t best know for objective discussion of pros and cons. What I will say however, is that there are alts out there that are ‘kind of’ being used for their intended use case, in the same way that bitcoin is also only ‘kind of’ doing so. Let’s face it - we’re not there yet. But we’re definitely getting closer, and my personal opinion is that there’s a small handful of coins in the running.

With hindsight I shouldn’t have expected ‘rational’.

It’s a brand name. When people want to get into crypto and ask me about it, they always say ‘I want to get some bitcoin’. They’re hardly aware that there are alternatives.

Gluten free pine cones. They taste great!

No, because you send GBP from Natwest to Revolut (which is free). Then within the app change it to EUR (which is free), then send EUR to GDAX (which is about €0.15). Whole process takes about 2 hours on a week day.

I’d use the ‘reason for payment’ field. First time I send a transaction to verify my account, it took about a week to clear. Now I can send by GBP, transferred to EUR using Revolut, in a matter of hours.

To be honest, if you’re going to ‘panic’ about a potentially lost £10, you might want to reconsider investing in crypto. You’ll give yourself a heart attack when you’re waiting a week for your £500 BTC transfer to confirm.

I wouldn’t bother about the crypto bit for Pro subscribers. Just open a UK and EUR accounts and use it as a bridge between your regular UK bank, and GDAX. It avoids the high transfer fees. Just buy your crypto on GDAX as usual. 
Natwest &gt; Revolut UK &gt; Revolut EUR &gt; GDAX

If you’re in the UK, check out Revolut. It allows you to deposit GBP from your bank, instantly exchange it to EUR, then deposit it to GDAX. Total cost is about €0.15. It’ll save you a fortune in Coinbase fees or SEPA transfer fees from your bank!

You’re missing the point. The BTC on your ledger IS the bank! You’re in control of your own currency!

It’s amazing, I agree! But let’s not get carried away. There are some decent/comparable alts out there! 
edit: sorry, was I not enthusiastic enough?

It’s funny you mention Harry Potter, because when you wrote ‘the other sub’, all I thought was ‘it’s Bcash not f’ing Voldemort’.

You’re in the wrong sub. Go back to nsfw, the grown-ups are trying to talk.

It’s a fair assumption to make, because Coinbase ask you to only send a small amount, approx £10 (or EUR/USD equivalent) in order to link your bank account to your Coinbase account. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:04:27
You sent Bcash to a BTC address?

The best way to find out is to use your Google Fu. Then research why you should buy alts instead of Bitcoin. You’ll get two biased views, and can make your own mind up, or buy both :). 
Edit: Just wanted to emphasise that I’m not trying to be a dick. Just want to point out that you’ll not get an unbiased response in r/bitcoin, just as you wont in any of the alt subs.

To be honest, if it were me and I could get away with leaving it in, I would. I guess you’re technically not lost anything until you cash it out. If you need money out for rent etc, I’d just cut my losses. Get what you can to get the important stuff paid for. Adding more risk by day trading sounds like a bad idea to me. Then again, what the hell do I know.

So, what’s the worst that can happen? *(Cough Bitgrail)*
