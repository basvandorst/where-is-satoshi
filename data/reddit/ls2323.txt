This is not what 'libertarian' means. Liberty != Libertarian 
As a side point, drug policy is not completely free from regulation in portugal, you can't just rock up with X kilos of heroin and start selling on the street. It is (still) very much regulated, they just decided it's better to help addicts than put them in prison.

So you are so far deep into propaganda-lala-land that it is unfathomable to you that *anybody* at all would actually want to live in NK. Just think about that for a moment. Do you *really* think that the only way to live is the American way and everybody must want this? It's like a cult! You have been brainwashed I am sorry to say. 
I have neither been to US nor NK, so any opinions I have are from elsewhere. There are also many other places I haven't been to.
However, having travelled a lot and lived for long periods in many diverse places, I have come to the conclusion that many/most so-called 3rd world countries are not as bad as they're made out to be. There is A LOT of propaganda in western media, probably 90% of all news-reports in western media is propaganda in one form or another (the angle of the story, WHY it is reported at this exact moment etc etc). 
3rd world countries, for all their failures, also have many good things about them, f.ex. entreprenourship. Whereas in the west everybody is a corporate wageslave. There is vibrancy, friendlyness, etc etc. A lot may be poor, sure, but also a lot are not. Americans are friendly too, but their government is not. Try to be poor and without a job and education in the US, you are WORSE off than in some 3rd world 'shithole' (and a lot in the US are in this situation).
Anyway this got too long. Just maybe think about why someone would want to live in NK (or another 'shithole', pick Zimbabwe f.ex). Research. Or even better, book a holiday to Zim, you'll be pleasantly surprised and mind-blown.

I have, it's actually a very very nice place to live (if you have some education, skills, money).
I would go live in Zimbabwe any day over living in the US f.ex. The US is probably one of the last places on earth I would go live.

1. I'm not about to read your whole manifesto just because you can figure out how to do copy/paste. 
2. The US is responsible for most wars in recent history, at the very least since WWII.  Britain is USs' lapdog.
3. No it was not, it was state capitalism. Only in name was it 'communism'. Communism does not require a dictator what a load of BS, in real communism there is no state. Communism means things are owned by *the people* (workers) not the state (as it was under Stalin, hence 'state capitalism').

Ultimately The Government is nothing more than the will of 'The People'. The people are backing the USD by all agreeing on its value, pretty much like Bitcoin and gold. However in the case of the USD, The People can decide to print some more whenever they like, with Bitcoin there is no such possibility.

Not so sure about the creditcard thing. I mean, after all, if I had maxed my CC a couple of years ago when bitcoin was a few $, then I would be a multi-gazillionaire right now.
 
That being said, don't invest what you can't afford to loose.

Libertarians are nuts. Bitcoin is great but does in no way require libertarianism! F.ex true communism is a moneyless society and could work with bitcoins (at least in the transition phase).

Saxo bank owners are basically satanists. Ultra libertarian. Coerces all employees to read a Ayn Rand book. The main owner, a Danish guy, living in Switzerland while trying to influence Danish politics by basically buying a whole political party called LA (bankrolling them) Etc. 
I would not put it past them to try to inflate the market with BS predictions pulled out of their asses like this because they themselves are heavily invested. They are also involved in an ICO (I will not mention which here).

We were discussing Libertarianism and you are the one that whatabouted with communism.
I suggested communism as an example of another system that also can work with bitcoins. I.e. libertarianism is not *required* for bitcoin to thrive.

Personal liberty (in all aspects) also means liberty to fuck you over...

How is it a misstatement? I assure you that it is not. I am perfectly entitled to my own opinion, thank you very much. My opinion as to what makes me want to stay in a country might be vastly different to yours. 
The fact that you can not fathom anybody would have such an opinion that is another matter. It shows that you probably is not very well traveled, I suggest booking a vacation to the nearest 'shithole' country and explore that for at least a month. 
Tell me a country that is worse than the US? I honestly can not think of one that would be worse right now. The people of the US are friendly enough for sure, but I do not want to live in a society where *everything* is about money, and yes, US is totally *defined* by money, just as an example look at hollywood movies compared to European movies. 'Every' parent  want their kid to grow up to be either a doctor, lawyer or in finance, so they can earn *money*. Most/many will not want them to grow up to simply choose something they love to do.
No I do not want to book a holiday for the US. I do not ever intend to set foot on that continent so long as it continues to be a draconian police state, confiscate devices at the border, behave like a total bully/warmonger and perpetuateAmerican Exceptionalism etc etc. 
The grandma thing was exaggerated of course, but there is truth there.

It is, and I have been to many parts of the world and many so-called 'shitholes'. Don't believe the propaganda dude.

The thing is though that if you mine, you can take any profits and further invest in more mining equipment. This will grow the business exponentially. The mining equipment will eventually go obsolete, but before that you can still sell it. Try to get hold of a S7 miner right now (basically nearly obsolete), they'll be like $2000+. So the mining equipment prices follow the Bitcoin/fiat rate meaning that it is similar to holding bitcoin in an investment sense. 
However, if you merely invest, your investment maybe worth more fiat but you won't increase your bitcoin holdings.
I don't have large capital though so would have ot start with like a single S9. However also looking into Monero mining which might be better to start off with as can use commodity CPUs. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:56:54
Thanks a lot, very helpful. The thing about mining that I find attractive is that the bitcoin rate has gone up so much which is making the payout (in fiat) much higher so the electricity costs become ever less important as the rate goes up. Of course the mining equipment prices is also going way up though. Also if using a mining pool the payout should be somewhat stable (i.e. low risk), whereas bitcoin investing is high risk.

KYC is largely BS anyway. If your intent is to money launder you can probably very easily fake a digital copy of a passport and utility-bill anyway. The KYC is meaningless and just a way for governments to keep track of (surveil) legitimate law obiding users.
Anybody with gimp or photoshop could fake this in like 10 mins. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:29:50
Thanks. What determines the size of a transaction? This is a bit of a mystery to me. 
Also, someone else ITT mentioned fees can be in the range of 5-20$ (lets say avg 10$ then). So if there is e.g. 2000 transactions per block, a miner might earn 20000$ plus the 12.5 bitcoins finders fee, right? Seems like a lot. 
Do you know where I can read more about these aspects? I am seriously looking into (serious) mining (noob atm. but getting up to speed fast). 
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:02:26
How much are the actual transfer fees? who/what sets them and how do you know what fee you will pay before you transfer?
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:39:59
It is fraud so it is very much a police matter.
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:59:02
That's just blowing my mind, because how can we ever expect bitcoin to be adopted by the general population if they can't really use it to pay for small stuff. If the fees are effectively larger than making bank transfers then it's a hard sell...
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:53:44
Sure I get your point, but you don't get mine it seems. You said:


Well, why not? I would say that specifically a serious person would do that. Let's say he has that 100 million. Why wouldn't he try to take out 1.8 million? How many lumps should he do it in? 10 x 180K? That would take even more time, a serious person doesn't have time (because time is money).
Maybe, since he is so careful about his money as you suggest, he is asking on reddit because it is FREE. Contacting lawyers is incredibly expensive even for small matters. Why blow 10K$ on involving lawyers at this stage?
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:12:22
