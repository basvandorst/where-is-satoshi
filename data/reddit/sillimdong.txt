The way I see it, crypto can be a powerful weapon for weakening nation states that (used to) control their currency. US globalist elites want to do that, but their influence and power depends on their own country's ability to use its currency to rule the world. So it seems that they have reasons to be for or against bitcoin, depending on how it's used. Iran, Russia and China start trading oil in bitcoin? Not good for the globalists. Some European country wants to break free from the Eurozone and set up capital controls? Bitcoin makes that more difficult, good for the globalists. Of course "the globalists" are those people who stand to gain from the weakening of nation states, either financially or ideologically, they don't need to be thought of as an organised group

Also the world economy running on bitcoin rather than some other country's national currency is a better scenario for the US in case economic hegemony is lost. I think both the US government and the people would be better off in a world were oil is traded in bitcoin rather than say yuan or rubles only.

You are thinking about Sweden, northern Europe. It's not like that everywhere. While I don't buy the conspiracy theory that immigration is meant to replace the native populations of Europe, it is indeed making us more similar to the US coasts (mixed, multiracial...). It's also very convenient for keeping salaries low, as migrants are less likely to demand wage raises given their economic background.

I would argue that food, sex, housing, weapons, fuel... all have some intrinsic value. Value may fluctuate or even be zero subjectively for a specific person, but these items will always have some value for at least someone. E.g. properly stored food will be worth something at least to someone as long as there are hungry people (even if it's worthless to you if you are not hungry) and until it spoils.

You clearly understand the underlying tech and you know that the blockchain provides a trustless system so the backing of a major government is not necessary for it to function, in principle.
But I imagine that your argument is that without the support of at least a major government, and lacking a clear benefit to the current power structure (governments, banks, big businesses), it will not be ALLOWED to function.
States cannot lose control of currency and still retain their power. Look at the southern members of the Eurozone: they lost control of their monetary policy and they are now at the mercy of Germany.
Something something power of the purse, power of the sword.
That is why bitcoin is so appealing to naive revolutionary types. They would like to see the current order subverted and assume by default that the new order will be better, because tech.
But those in power have an art of taking something that is potentially revolutionary, a threat to their control if you will, and turning into something useful to them. This happened already and can happen to cryptocurrencies.
What will come out of this depends on the balance of power between those who stand to gain and those who stand to lose.
Who would benefit from a widely adopted currency where monetary policy is no longer discretionary (and deflationary by default)? Who would benefit by being able to move money freely across borders? If these people are stronger than those who stand to lose, then we will see wide adoption. There is no guarantee that we will see widespread adoption of bitcoin, but of some crypto.
Still brand recognition is important. If you were the leader of a middle-eastern country which can't sell oil or doesn't want to sell oil in USD nor in other major currencies, what would you turn to? Bitcoin or some other coin? I say Bitcoin. I also say you probably wouldn't do this for fear of being invaded.

Take out enough miners, difficulty drops and it becomes profitable to mine with less and less powerful hardware. I imagine the attack would be more sophisticated, like controlling miner pools / state subsidized mining. This requires some degree of international coordination.

Not him, but I guess he means that all currencies work because people trust them to be worth something. They are worth nothing without people believing that they are worth something. The only difference between fiat currency and crypto in this respect is that if a new currency is gradually introduced you need "greater fools" to progressively adopt it based on trust, while fiat is forced on all people directly at the same time, so you don't regard people accepting payment in fiat as deluded fools.

It's not really the fact that there are "only" 21 million of it that make bitcoin scarce. It's the fact that the amount is growing slowly and predictably over time. The rate of growth of the supply is what matters. It is limited, known in advance, and will not adapt to events/political pressure.

Most people over here would suggest buying a hardware wallet if the amount is enough to justify the expense. Otherwise I would make a few different paper wallets and split the sum across them, then lock them up somewhere safe. You can download bitadress.org page on a clean computer, go offline, use it to generate several private/public key pairs, write down the keys and then send the money over there. If you want part of the money to be easier to access you may consider keeping some in a hot wallet, possibly using a service like greenaddress.it where two keys are needed to spend the money (one is yours, one is theirs). It gives you some bank-like peace of mind with all the 2FA security and the guarantee that they cannot run away with your coins. Ultimately it's your decision.

The estimate may be way off. I understand that they just assume that 60% of miner's profits are used to cover power expenses and that electricity costs a fixed amount per kWh.

I see two possible futures, two extremes.
In the first one, adoption is as a mere store of value for Bitcoin, expanding to a (possibly large) fraction of the gold market cap. No real use as a currency, maybe because governments manage to contain it. Other cryptos are adopted by governments, more centralised and tamed, so central banks can retain a degree of control on money supply, perhaps while conveniently blaming the deflationary nature of crypto when they don't want to expand the money supply / bail out. Ripple-like settlement systems for banks and big corps and the average Joe still uses fiat.
In the second scenario I see full adoption of crypto and smart contracts. End of State as we know it as no more monetary policy is possible and taxation also becomes difficult. This can't happen without major violence breaking out. I imagine this coupled with massive unemployment and crime due to collapse of the State as an employer and law enforcer. Gig economy plus the danger of unemployment turns the workers who don't want to become criminals into servants with no job security. A bleak future.
Now I'm sure the future will find a way to surprise me and come out with a completely different outcome...

I understand that tethers are artificially kept at par with dollars: easy to do while people sell dollars to buy tethers, hard to do if people want the dollars back and start selling tethers. But if you compare btc market cap with tether's you see that the ratio is more than 200. So even if USDT goes to 0 and people panic and this somehow leads to btc selling it wouldn't still impact btc price much. Just my opinion.

We can't possibly know. If people in general knew that on a given day btc price will drop, they would sell before, so the price would have dropped already and it wouldn't drop that day any more. A piece of news changes the price only if it is a surprise to at least some people. Anyway, I say decide in advance how much you want to invest, split it into chunks and decide in advance when you will buy each chunk. Say you want to buy 0.5 btc, you can buy 0.1 now, 0.1 in a week, 0.1 in two weeks, and so on.

If you started on Jan 1, 2017 investing 100 every week, by Sept 10, 2017 you would have spent 4100 and have the equivalent of 11641 (roughly a factor 2.8 increase in capital).
On the other hand if you had bought 100 every day the price hit an all time high you would have spent 5500 and have the equivalent of 14472, so roughly 2.6 increase.
What makes the most difference is not when you buy, but if you buy at all.

Widespread adoption of crypto as a currency could be prevented by banning points of sale, ATMs, exchanges, payment of wages in crypto... ultimately any point of contact between the real economy and the crypto ecosystem. State can still force usage of fiat by requiring payment of taxes and fines in fiat. I wonder if it is technically feasible to force miners to blacklist (not process transactions for) specific addresses. Or they could make a whitelist of accredited crypto investors with approved addresses and shut out everyone else.

I don't think it's so simple. When businesses close down they don't produce anymore, which would result in prices rising because there is less supply, but they also don't pay wages and dividends anymore, which results in less money, less demand for goods. I am not saying you are wrong, but I think you need to do the math/run a simulation. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:23:47
Not necessarily. Say one day btc price stabilizes. It still has value for people even in the absence of rising prices because it lets you move money across borders, store value in a relatively stable way, etc... At that point value has been created for everybody, not just for holders, because btc is new financial infrastructure that is objectively worth something to those who use it and in principle anybody can use it, even indirectly. Then no one really lost anything. Early adopters just gained more than late adopters.

Right. So you can see the transaction in the blockchain when you send the coins. The transaction leaves from a Coinbase address to which you do not have the private key. You may argue that this is the same as any software wallet that does not show you the private key but somehow handles it behind the scenes. But it is not, because you do not know what Coinbase does with the private keys, and you can't possibly know, not even in principle. They may manually interfere with your transaction, for example decide to put it on hold and not send it until you provide further confirmation. They may even freeze your assets. Not saying that they will, but you can't exclude this.

A long time ago there was this thing called free software. It was the revolution. I mean, the (software) means of production were finally in the hands of the people. The fucking revolution. RMS, GNU, free as in freedom, and so on. Some people said, well, open source is cool, free software and out-of-control-beards not so much. Then we got software as a service, and now everything runs "on the cloud" (someone else's computer) and is not under our control anymore, no matter whether it's open source or not. Now developers contribute to open source projects to build their CV rather than out of ideological commitment to free software. There was no revolution. Now apply this to bitcoin VS blockchain. That's the point the guy above is missing, IMO.

Scamcoins would be akin to those "free" shareware/spyware/adware programs you would download from tucows or similar sites back in the day. They don't hurt the ecosystem, they only hurt the people being scammed. The blockchain VS bitcoin thing is more about how powerful private interests will manage to turn the initial "hacker spirit, collaboration, love" into "we make money, you code for free, maybe we will hire you if you are really good". We might end up with a blockchain in name only, meaning not decentralized nor permissionless, so that government will retain control over the currency. This is what these economists want, and it's probably what is going to happen. To keep the comparison with free software, we all like Linux but we all ended up with an iPhone in our pockets. As to how and when, I have no idea.

If you try to pay online with a Korean credit card on sites that follow Korean rules, above a certain threshold you have to authenticate using something similar to a verified by Visa system, but based on an ActiveX that works only under Windows. To set this up you also need a Korean social security number. Korean SSNs can be issued to foreigners who receive a foreigner registration card (e.g. people on a work visa) but if you plan to stay on a tourist visa you don't get one by default, and I don't know if you can get one at all.
