They are halving the rate at which they are mined/discovered. The total sum of bitcoin doesn't change.

Being an electrical engineer is nothing to scoff at though. Maybe not 1% money but enough money to support a family without really ever having to worry about things too much.

Well yeah, having financial security is one of the most basic contributers to happiness. Of course people are going to focus on the monetary aspects

This is my thought too. A gain is still a gain. I'm on this train for the (relatively) long haul at least. I'm not gonna make millions but I'm getting a much better return than my ira is so I'm happy.

Not everyone can ride a bike where they live.

Why not sell some and make a hefty profit and leave 1 or 2 in case it keeps going?  Bitcoin has almost died a couple times and it's always come back with incredible gains

Losing .7 bit coin would seriously depress me

IF you have 5million you can live pretty comfortably just off the dividends and interest indefinitely

That's cool but why are your parked on the sidewalk like an ass?

Yeah I put in at 9k and put twice as much in at 18k so it's a bit of a mixed bag. Wish I would of waited a week to buy but I've no doubt it will raise to 20k and more so I'm not particularly concerned.

People make really dumb decisions when it comes to money. You wouldn't share a savings account with a friend would you? Or buy a house with a friend without a strict legal agreement. What happens if they have a fallout or one of them gets seriously sick and "needs" the money. It's just a dumb fucking idea. I trust my best friend with my life but I wouldn't put him in control of my finances.

Is it really a moon if it's almost as big as pluto?

I get your point but you're wrong haha. There are absolutely gold mines digging up more gold as we speak.

Having a month long honeymoon traveling tropical resorts and doing anything you want sounds pretty fucking good to me.

Paying off your debts is always a good plan. Paying interest is costing you money every day.

It's pretty easy to hear a news report on bit coin or have a friend mention and end up on here.

Unfortunately Gemini is not available in many states.

You don't need some crazy investment to be able to retire man. A solid 401k or ira with company backing will let you retire just fine. Maybe not with tons of money but enough to get by.

You sound like a fucking child. Get over yourself.

Anyone who thinks bitcoin will replace usd in the next decade is crazy.
@_date: 2019-04-27 23:29:12
I'm not entirely sure what the point of your hypothetical scenario is. Obviously it's going to be bitcoin because it's the largest in distribution and has the highest name recognition. That means absolutely Jack shit about its value.

Subarus are pretty damn good in snow. They're the car of choice in Alaska.
