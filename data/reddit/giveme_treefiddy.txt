He explicitly said during the campaign that he was in favor of allowing for competing currencies and didn't think linking the dollar to gold was the right direction forward.

You need to reread his comment.

Except as taxable income over the course of a year, unless you are going on a spending binge, you are not going to spend all of your millions of BTC.
If you spend lightly in BTC you won't be pushed to new tax brackets.

Why sell and take the tax hit?
Just use BTC for everything.
Dump the dollar.

Here's the problem with your, and many others, thinking:
You operate under the assumption that the internet should be a one size fits all operation.
Many people would be perfectly happy paying for specific services and cutting the fat in a free market system.
New companies don't need to be able to serve every single person in a designated area. New companies need to be able to start small and offer limited services.
Imagine if there were a law that said online book stores had to operate a certain way... we may have never had Amazon as we know it. It started small as a book store and slowly branched out into what we know it as today.
