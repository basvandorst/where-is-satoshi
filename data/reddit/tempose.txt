classic way of hoarding BTC

I trust coinbase enough to leave some coin there. I am not sure I want to go through the hassle of having a paper wallet.

I hope you know the problems they face in reaching a consensus. They are glacial in releasing software but ensure quality. In any democracy there will be difference in opinion, but that difference should never stagnate the pace of development.

How can the article be bad press when they say it is going mainstream!! The article is totally positive.

good plan of pitching the cryptos agains one another. I am sure you know of how better doge did than bitcoin. Hope you have a good campaign, I am not one contributing to such a competition

yes, that seems like ages ago in bitcoin times...
@_date: 2014-02-14 04:41:36
haha, no. I was showing off that I've been buying coins at regular intervals.
@_date: 2014-06-09 00:11:32
I tried looking for it. They made it really hard to do that!

How much did you get in donations? How much did you spend? Do you have anything left over for the next time or do you need more donations?

DONT transfer any BTC without confirmation of debit! There is no way around it once you realize that it is fake. Tell the buyer to be patient or else tell him you will return the money if he is not happy

I had this happend to me. When I made the purchase I did not have the cash in my checking account. They tried taking money from it and failed. I bought the bitcoin on friday and it was supposed to be delivered to me on Wed. I realized that I did not enough case on saturday and immediately deposited a check. On the day of delivery they tried again and the debit when through and I got my coin. 
tl;dr... go deposit enough money by the day of delivery. Everything should be fine.

yes, you can place a bid. if someone sell you can buy. mtgox is for trading. try practicing with 10mBTC

I think it is actually a good idea to slowly ease newbies into bitcoin. Also you don't want to let speculators in so fast. Coinbase is not a trading platform. It is more of an exchange for businesses to convert bitcoin to dollar.

Where is this reddit restaurant located?
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:48:25

donated 1 mBTC
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:45:41
they hold it until you explicitly withdraw. so yes, you can buy another coin after 5 minutes
@_date: 2013-12-16 02:45:13
I tried looking and was not able to find how to take a backup of the mtgox OTP? Any suggestions?
