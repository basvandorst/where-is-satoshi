Lol. Happy for you.
what was your fee?
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:59:36
thats the most annoying part is that they recommend fee's that are not adequate. I would have paid a 4$ fee, doubling mine of 2$ if I knew it was gonna be this bad.... but then again do you think doubling would have made a difference? ����

@_date: 2017-12-17 21:59:29
Any suggestions?

I don't get what you are arguing with him about? 
I don't get how you can sit here and argue that a 50$ transaction with a 2$ fee, taking multiple days to process, with no signs of it ever processing, or processing soon, is a good service or technology. Its horrible.
There being a high demand and interest does nothing to help prove any point you're trying to make and what leads you to believe the timings and fees will improve? When the only signs out there is that it will continue to get worse with the demand and interest. The current system is lousy, period. 
The only thing BTC is good for right now is investing and watching your money grow. Other than that, for what its actually there for, currency, transactions, its garbage.
