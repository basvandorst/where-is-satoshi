definitely not, coinbase really likes keeping peoples coins hostage and has 0 legal accountability if they just decide to keep your coin.

If BIP148 fails then off to one of those scamcoins you go :D

How about one that is actually a licensed? Bitstamp is the only EU one afaik, all the others - coinbase, kraken, etc can just keep all the coins they hold with 0 repercussions. I don't understand why people keep falling for those sites.

Eth alone makes up ~75% of gpu mining. Once eth goes poof, all other coins difficulties will jump 4x with everyone switching over from eth and the profits get slashed by 4x.

a modern bitcoin asic will set you back around $1.5k whereas the 1000 eth minimum is worth $370k right now

POS wouldn't solve this, it is in fact inferior for securing a network due to the volatility of its trust system and more centralized due to the insane buy-in. 
If this meeting was about PoS etherum, there would be no UASF, there would only be the chinese miners collectively validating a bullshit block to turn their 51%+ stake into 100% stake in an instant.

Every bitcoin user hashing with their gpu's would hardly make a dent nowadays, ASICs are over 100 times more efficient per dollar and there are a lot more dollars invested into ASICs. 
As u/asterion9 suggested, buying hashing power on sites like nicehash is not a bad idea though.

I wonder who are they planning to sell those to? 
Altcoin mining profits are already plummeting and with eth ice age kicking in, miners buying in today will be lucky to make ROI. 
Massive selloffs to ensue, the market will be flooded with $100 470's in 3 - 5 months time and and nobody will be interested in a brand new £250 card with no resale value outside mining.
These companies are *way* too late to the party.

1000+ is not an estimate but a statement by vitalik from his interview in april
