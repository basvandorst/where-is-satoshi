I wouldn't say I'm at the "very head". But heavily involved, yes.

In the case of this bond issue it's easy, since we're only dealing with qualified institutional buyers. So we know them very well. 
When we get down to issuing shares of public companies able to be purchased by retail investors, the challenge will be greater. But we have a plan :).

I believe all bitcoin are bearer instruments.

I work at Overstock, wrote the media release announcing all this that'll go out in a few minutes, and this stuff is my life. For better or worse.

No. We're using the Open Asset protocol. Specifically, ~~Circle~~ Colored Coins.
@_date: 2015-06-05 20:28:45
This is a great story, but there's one point that's incorrect. The issuance will indeed be on the bitcoin blockchain. We're using colored coins to do it.
@_date: 2015-06-05 23:19:02
You also rock, Sundoshi.
@_date: 2015-06-05 21:35:22
I'll look for you there if I need you.

It's supposed to be "TØ". Maybe your browser couldn't handle the 'empty set' character?
@_date: 2015-06-05 21:53:37
Working on that.
@_date: 2015-06-06 02:31:35
TØ is already built.
@_date: 2015-06-06 02:34:49
Initially only qualified institutional buyers can participate.
@_date: 2015-06-05 22:34:20
Ooops, I misspoke. I mean colored coins. Thanks for catching that.

Hey...I'm currently at OSTK. We made Bitcoin integration a top priority and pulled it off in record time internally. However the third party that handles checkout for international customers is going to take a little longer to update their own codebase. But they'll get there...too much demand not to.

According to the SEC, [you're the scumbag](

[Here's an extremely compressed, lowish quality version]( I put on YouTube just for the purposes of internal review (I work with Patrick). I suppose it's fine for you guys to watch if you can't access the much higher quality CATO-hosted version.

I really like this fellow.

How are a bunch of Java geeks going to not talk about this project?
@_date: 2014-10-26 21:51:22
Thank you!

Shorting shares you do not properly borrow is illegal, manipulative and thus, cheating. But unless you are a billionaire hedge fund manager or on the stock loan desk at Goldman Sachs you most certainly can't do it anyway. 
@_date: 2014-10-10 00:34:42
Legal shorting is good for the market. You sound like a penny stock pumper. No offense.
@_date: 2014-11-21 23:29:51
This may or may not be a satisfactory reason for you, but Patrick has spent much of his life living in Asia, speaks fluent Mandarin, and before going into business, was a professor of Asian studies at Dartmouth.
So...he's fond of Asian culture and prefers Mandarin collared suits.

Amazon has a policy of price matching. [Last time we did this]( prices got ridiculously low, and that will affect Amazon more than us.
@_date: 2014-12-16 21:05:13
So you were the guy! On behalf of Overstock.com, thank you :).
@_date: 2015-05-12 22:40:37
You have the vision. Truly, the number of market ills that could be corrected by blockchain trading are numerous. I'm personally betting quite a bit on its inevitability.

It's paraphrasing Hunter S Thompson. He's a famous writer.

It's a skydiving injury. Patrick Byrne is more alpha than you could ever hope to be. Ever.
@_date: 2015-01-22 14:09:31
You're probably right.
@_date: 2015-01-22 14:10:47
Yes. He was referring to the Dept of Agriculture or something like that.

Amazon will have to lower its prices on books to meet Overstock. Both will lose money but Amazon will lose many millions to Overstock's many thousands. Going into Q4 this is a big deal.

I've been a press secretary and this is a trick even legitimate reporters use. They say, "didn't immediately respond" without having actually tried to get a comment. 
Not knowing the nature of bitcoin, the author did that. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 04:54:35
Yep. And none of it includes the word douche. It's largely focused on a peer to peer electronic cash system and asymmetric cryptography.
@_date: 2018-02-27 04:49:35
I'm impressed you know so much about the nuances of the mind belonging to somebody about whom so very little is known. 
Wait...are you Satoshi?
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:05:39
Actually he was. 
Not sure about the frozen part. But he did die in mid 2014.
@_date: 2018-02-27 04:34:51
Right, and Satoshi set the record straight on Dorian within hours. Your argument, based on someone being a "douche" whom the community made quick work of doesn't hold up. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 04:14:19
It was not immediate. It happened during Consensus 2016 (I was there) and it was at least 48 hours before the group there reached...um...*consensus* that it couldn't be Wright. The first 24 hours it was cautiously accepted.

Bitcoin remains in our DNA. And on our checkout page.

If I'd known it was in regard to the top comment on r/bitcoin I'd have tweeted my reply much sooner ;).
