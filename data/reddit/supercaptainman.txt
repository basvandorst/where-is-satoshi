He absolutely does. I had no idea he only got out of debt last year. He deserves to benefit from Bitcoin for bringing so many people into it.

Btc has gone up like 25x this year. 50k is now less than 4x away.

Eventually he would send my portion back to my wallet, from which I would cash out. He wouldn't send me the wallet itself.

Oh my god people. Inflation is NOT a bad thing! Please read an economics book. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:06:22
Ok dude. Inflation in and of itself is not a system of control. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:04:42
Its not too much. More than 1k but less than 10k. Tax consultant may be an option I suppose.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:23:50
Kinda like when everyone was saying this went it dipped from 5k to 3700 and everyone thought that was it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:19:59
Bitfinex and Gdax have been thousands apart all morning. Bitcoin on Gdax never even went back below 15k on the "dip".

I miss the vegeta memes. What's the next significant meme level? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:11:10
Where are you from? If you're from the US then Gdax and Gemini will be your best options. If your goal was to just buy and hold then either are fine. Coinbase will also do the trick in that case. If you wanted to do some occasional trading then Gdax will be the best option there. Gemini is nice though for a quick, low fee buy since they precredit your ACH deposit from your bank. If you're from a play outside the US, Gdax is still a good option but Bitfinex is also usable. They have a bit larger coin selection than Gdax but don't serve US customers anymore. Kraken is an option as well but I've heard of reliability issues with them in the past. 
In order to buy some Dash, or most other alt coins, you'd have to buy Bitcoin first on one of those exchanges and then send it to an alt coin exchange such as Bittrex, Binance, Crytopia to name the bigger ones. These exchanges do not accept fiat money, they only trade in crypto pairs. I'd recommend Bittrex for overall coin selection and also for volume. Highest volume/liquidity of any exchange I believe which is very nice to have. Here you can find Dash and purchase with your Bitcoin. It might take some time to learn to navigate the exchanges but you'll get the hang of it. Also just saying don't go all in on Dash. There's no guarantee that any coin will see the gains it saw the previous year. Best to stay diversified. Btc, ether, litecoin, monero, dash aren't bad holds. And with the way the market is right now you're gonna wanna make sure you always have a good chunk of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:31:35
Hard to say. Massive fear of missing out driving the American exchange, Gdax, versus the more global exchange Bitfinex. More bears and sell walls on bitfinex. Gdax is also connected to Coinbase, which is where a lot of newbies first buy their coins. So it was probably a bunch of noobs going crazy, whereas Bitfinex had much less noob exposure. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:33:57
Just start dollar cost averaging in now.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:52:46
Yeah you can buy any amount. On Coinbase I'm pretty sure you can buy $1 worth if you wanted to. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:34:22
Correct. Each exchange is its own market. The gaps are usually closed by arbitrage bots, but for the past day bitfinex has been very slow to process withdrawals so no one was able to buy it cheap on bitfinex and then sell it over on gdax. The prices are usually close to each other. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:19:01
Well you can buy ether and litecoin with cash as well on gdax but that's all they have. Also Kraken allows other alts to be purchased with cash too. But yes, the majority of alts must be purchased with Bitcoin however.
And good luck with the snow! I'm from Connecticut so it's a regular occurrence here.

Most likely he did not lose 8mil. With leverage he may have only lose a fraction of that. But at minimum he lost 80k.
@_date: 2018-05-28 17:56:23
No this image is stolen directly from barney on Twitter 
@_date: 2018-05-21 16:47:48
Sure it does. Which is how he lost a minimum of 80k in what was most likely a small percentage move. If he traded that 80k with no leverage, he wouldn't lose it all unless bitcoin went to zero. But since he used leverage and held a position of 8mil, he lost his 80k+ of margin much faster. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 15:08:35
Except blockchain analysis can easily uncover anonymity which is why private coins such as Monero, Zcash and Dash were created.
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:47:59
For a wallet or an exchange? For an exchange you can just move it over to GDAX which Coinbase uses.

Id also be willing to test it and send you half the profits.

Why is it sold at such a premium? 
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:27:52
You missed the point. You miss out on potential gains whether you make a purchase in BTC in USD, because that usd could also been put into BTC. But by using BTC you are validating it as a form of currency. What you can do to not miss out on the potential gains you could have experienced is to spend the the BTC, and then immediately buy more BTC with the USD you would have used.

Open an online savings account for 1.X% interest rate. I just did with gs bank, but Ally and others are good options. Instead of making pennies per month on thousands of dollars, I'm making dollars per month.

Real estate can be a very lucrative, stable investment. Surely not one as moon capable as bitcoin, but stability is something bitcoin has. Of course youre free to do whatever you want with your money. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:37:40
Ah yes Ive heard the kraken API is absolute shit. What about bittrex? though Bitfinex would be ideal if youre sticking to major coins. Unfortunately being in the US Ill be losing access to Bitfinex.
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:24:22
No idea! Read Bitfinex' statement to see if theirs any language dealing with location or citizenship.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:55:55
Inflation encourages investing and purchasing. Deflation encourages holding and doing nothing with your money. The former, under predictable regulation and restriction, is better for economic growth. If your currency continues to appreciate why would you ever want to spend it?

For Blockchain tech in general yes I agree. For cryptocurrencies specifically, if bitcoin fails it may deter mainstream adoption for others. At least for a while.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:10:14
Please explain to me why big blocks is better for and healthier to the entire crypto community. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:21:13
The current nature of crypto and potential mainstream adoption relies on bitcoins success though. It's the only one that's almost a household name and if it fails it would be much harder for the others to succeed in the mainstream.

Charlie has said many times that he wants Bitcoin to succeed. And for LTC to take the burden of smaller and faster transactions while Bitcoin remains the primary store of value.

Your timeframe is too short. Anything can happen in 7 days. 7 years though... Way more than double. Heck even 7 months.

Thats why you should use gemini in situations like that! And then once the deposit clears send it over to gdax.

No it was done by their partner Simplex. Charlie Shrem stated that the Changelly CEO is a Bitcoin proponent and regularly refers to bcash as a scam.

Ah ok. The private key is created offline, that makes sense.
If you send bitcoin to an address on the wallet, the wallet won't recieve it until you connect though, correct?
Is the private key at risk in this instance? 
@_date: 2018-02-16 22:28:12
Interesting that despite the heavy moderation here a post having nothing at all to do with bitcoin wasn't removed... 
@_date: 2017-10-10 02:48:25
Depends on your time frame. In the long run, it's not too late at all. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 01:29:11
I would literally put every dollar I have into bitcoin and possibly take out a loan if it went to $500.
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:51:39
At this point 100 bucks is less than 2%. Though that is fast for half a second. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 03:25:06
I never directly recieved money. They paid for accommodations on vacation. I owed them a certain amount. But after buying them Bitcoin I then owed them the equivalent amount less. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 19:43:27
The thing is it was paid back in a weird, sort of undocumentable way. I owed her about $400 for vacation expenses, but I basically only paid her $250 since I bought her $150 worth of bitcoin.
It's a small amount but I figured I'd better see what the proper thing to do is.
@_date: 2017-10-07 12:31:29
Sorry I said paid in cash just to avoid confusion, since basically I kept the amount in cash I would have otherwise given to them. It is the second option. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 02:49:25
That is odd indeed that they'd disable btc payments for a Blockchain package

It's leveraged 100x on bitmex and the dude only lost 1/100 of this amount which is 47k. "Only". But at least it wasn't 4.7 mil. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:38:24
You coulda bought at 57 or whatever it was
@_date: 2017-07-09 11:50:06
Wasn't criticizing you, just wondering what your reasons were is all. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 02:10:46
Curious as to why you're against converting to fiat? As for your request I cannot help you unfortunately. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 14:09:09
If you use Gemini I highly suggest ACH transfers over wire transfers. Also you can expect to wait up a week for your funds to clear to be able to withdraw them again. Otherwise being able to buy instantly is  nice.
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:17:08
Coinbase Pro (formerly GDAX) had 0% fee limit orders up until recently. And now with a 0.15% fee they are still far cheaper than Gemini.
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:56:31
1 week wait period to sell? And if you bought in at 400 how have you lost money?
@_date: 2017-06-26 02:09:24
It isn't really appropriate to promise something that you have no ability to know is true. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:44:17
Its pretty close to instant.
