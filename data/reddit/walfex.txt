More like Enron IMO

But why current market worth? Why not FMV at time of the lawsuit/official bankruptcy (assuming they fall apart and are brought to court). 
They could be trying to hold the market down until they cash out/file bankruptcy and then they can start fresh and buy cheap bitcoins with "clean" money. If Bitcoin takes off while Gox is still "working on an update" then they could potentially be in for a even larger lawsuit later on if they don't know what they are doing I would assume.

sorry I mean SEC type auditing/accounting rules. As an accountant I just want to make sure there is a paper trail so no one can hide anything from the public. My regulation laws would be for more transparency.
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:27:13
This is still big news. Far from useless...

Ugh, typed up response and my cat hit close window on my external keyboard on the floor... I was saying we need a [Sarbanes-Oxley]( of Bitcoin for the US Exchanges or something. I agree with your point, and that is why it is suchhhhhhhh a dangerous game trying to put rules in place.
what I was typing before was that I see MtGox as being similar to Enron. Sketchy stuff going down, prices too good to be true, and now it has all come crashing down. Innocent people are losing fortunes while Kenneth Lay and Jeff Skilling (I'm going on memory sorry if not correct names for Enron) get slaps on the wrist. Mark (Gox) is the Ken Lay, and we need some sort of SOX in place for US Exchanges so that this disaster doesn't happen here with any exchange.

I wonder what accounting method they will use to figure this out.
How much can people get back if they have a BTC balance vs a USD balance? What price will their BTC be worth in USD (if converted via what time/exchange price)?
It's just a shitshow over there.

They say that Gox is no longer factored into their index price. This is what their ETF will be based on I believe. Gox is still on the page just to show the current price there.

Difference is between other exchanges allowing and them being required. I would want all large exchanges who deal with Bitcoin in the US to require auditing and all the SEC type rules, Bitcoin is the real deal. Regulate the exchanges not investors.

Ross: Tried to hire hitmen to protect the identities of his customers
Karpeles: Goxed it all up
So when this is all over I would say Karpeles will be more hated and fucked.

No worries. I agree the future legit exchanges will do it voluntarily but just requiring it to some degree would be a great way to filter out some potential Gox shit (see my post above with the SOX def, that's what I see happening to exchanges, more liability)
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:10:50
I am not talking crazy regulation, but some time. To prevent like insider trading and such. There is obviously some shady shit at Gox that needs to be prevented. Regulate the exchange not the technology

Thank you good sir.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:41:52
Yes. This is why Lawsky is correct and exchanges will need some special set of rules to protect customers, what we do once we have our BTC is our choice and should be free of shackles.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:10:35
Whoever pops up in NYC once Lawsky gives the go (or else Bitstamp).

Send your BTC to BTC-E and then when you're looking at the BTC/LTC chart you can put in buy sell orders.  Took me a few minutes and I had my BTC transferred and got some LTC.
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:00:58
I'm keeping mine in BTC-E for now and gonna wait until I cash out of LTC to move the BTC again, I only took 1/10th of my BTC and switched to LTC.

I was literally thinking of doing this today while in Tax class and actually took all the notes in class to make sure I remembered it... I'd say yes go for it!
@_date: 2013-10-24 05:48:43
well I have a handful of BTC so I feel lost and confused haha
@_date: 2013-10-24 06:13:50
You need a Chinese bank account I believe.
@_date: 2013-12-17 11:40:51
"Just a week after China's new rules restricting Bitcoin trading sent the virtual currency on a downward spiral, prices have recovered. Analysts said the regulations may actually give Bitcoin the recognition it needs to be a tradeable asset. PHOTOS. A pile of ..."  That is from my Google News Alert.  Nothing from link right now.
@_date: 2013-10-24 05:42:50
So what to do?  I don't get what is happening.  
@_date: 2013-10-24 13:07:15
JK ignore the 3 days.  Looking at my bank and coinbase it usually takes one day before it shows up in my bank account.  Hopefully my sell earlier during roller coaster shows up tomorrow (Friday USA).

Remember bitcoins are worth more now so volume isn't the best.
Volume in USD bro... 
@_date: 2013-10-24 13:54:51
Yah, I should mention I'm a "lvl 2" so I have higher limits and (maybe?) faster withdraw time.  
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:09:42
Someone else will have to answer this one.  I believe so but I haven't done it so I am not sure and don't have my password on me (written down and on vacation)
@_date: 2013-10-24 06:03:35
Usually like 3 days until it is in my account.  Not longer I don't think.
