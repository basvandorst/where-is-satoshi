They're coming for derivatives of BTC, not BTC itself.  There's no change in access to BTC.

That's 3k per year.  Capital losses carry over and can be applied against future gains and/or income, 3k per year, until you've offset the total of your loss.
I agree that it's not ideal, but at least all of the loss can (eventually) be absorbed.

If you're concerned about exchanges, then don't use them.  Use your BTC as intended.  Why are you exchanging them for fiat in the first place?

Plants grow by combining CO2 from the air with water and minerals from the soil using visible photons for energy.   All they're doing by mining is keeping the place warm.    They're certainly not "growing produce from heat byproduct".   They're not doing anything wrong, but they're definitely engaging in hyperbole.

Your stamp analogy is describing a collectible, which may (currently) describe BTC.   I don't think it is an accurate analogy for stock.  One major difference is that, if I hold stock in certain companies (Coca-Cola, Exxon, Microsoft, AT&amp;T, etc), they will pay me for owning that stock.  This is in addition to the value of the stock itself, which is derived (in part) from the activities of an entity which produces things which people need and/or value independent of the stock itself.
You could make a convincing argument that stocks are currently overvalued or that the stock market tracks investor emotion as much as the value of the companies it represents.  However, I don't think you can accurately compare stock to collectibles.
Edit: plural
