But by the time you have paid for it over the 15 or 30 years, you could have $0 in the bank and a $500k net worth. $500k isn't rich by any means, especially for older people. It definitely isn't really enough to retire on.

I said that they appear as liabilities *on the bank's balance sheet*.
The entry would be a debit to cash and a credit to deposits. But on the balance sheet, deposits are reported as a liability because the bank has the obligation to return the money to the customer.

The SEC and US law says they have to monitor it.
They don't actively report the transactions to anyone. They just have to track it and have the info so that investigators can track money more easily to uncover money laundering.

The bank doesn't *own* the money though in the sense that we usually define ownership... they are holding it to you with an obligation to give it back. At this point, it is just pedantic. Yes, the cash is recorded as an asset, but the account is a liability.

What he said is objectively true. Banks list customer money held in their accounts as a liability not an asset.

Are you suggesting that banks take your money and keep X number of $100 in a box in the back labelled "gamerecer" because that would be extremely inefficient, probably cause the bank to close, and cause 0% interest on all accounts. Do you understand how banks make money?

Except banks do unsecured loans all the time. Call your branch, I guarantee you they offer personal loans.
