Thats exactly my point.


I understand having a liquid online currency (paypal?) but most people, from what I've seen from everywhere BUT this subreddit, are holding onto these magical coins assuming that in 10 years they'll be worth billions of dollars, and they'll be able to retire.
I'm not speaking that "most people won't spend $5 here and there". What I'm trying to propose is that if you have 10 bitcoins, you're not likely to spend more than 1 or 2, hoping the other coins will keep going up in value. 
I understand wanting to buy a cup of coffee with a bitcoin, what I dont understand is why people would pay 0.01 bitcoins today, only to have coffee worth 0.001 next year, and 0.000001 after that.  Why would you shoot your own potential wealth growth in the foot?
Isn't it easier to buy coffee with cash, and hold onto the bitcoins as an investment?

Yerjosh, I feel your pain. I tried 3 separate times (at 150 dollars, 300 and 600) and have yet to find a good website that has a reasonable way of getting coins to my wallet.
I think we've found the biggest barrier to entry. Nobody thats not a bitcoin expert can buy them :(

Not saying we should or shouldn't change. I just think theres too much stubborn in the world.  I think it'd just take two or three large retailers to make or break the Bitcoin vibe. 
Walmart and Starbucks picks it up? Bitcoin is golden. 
Alternatively, if Walmart makes "WaltonCoins" bitcoin may be doomed. 
I realize all the benefits of Bitcoin over a company-produced online currency, etc etc etc.. but do you think the majority of low-information Americans do?

I believe if someone comes up with a way to run bitcoin through a credit scanner, the world'll be a much more accepting place, as the physical tech would already be in place. 
Hurry up, science!

I realize, and as you may have guessed by my now massive 0.011 (thank you) collection, I am more interested in bitcoin theory than actual investing/use. 
I do appreciate your viewpoint on it, and I thank you for the well worded reply. 
I would really like to see bitcoin become a very modern/widely-accepted currency, I just believe we are not there as a culture. I personally wonder how Bitcoin will maintain its superioroty against others  or how the market will react with influences such as China making a splash.
I, sir, will hold onto your tenth-bit-cent and I hope someday, if we meet in person, I will use it to buy you a cup of coffee, and discuss how this whole bitcoin thing played out. :)

As someone with a massive bitcoin investment (just about 1 bit cent) I really don't think many people will want to hop off the bandwagon as quickly as you say.
Litecoin went from $2 to over $14 in a little over 2 weeks. Are you really going to cash out your 'coin money for a cup of coffee, if bitcoin has the potential of reaching $100k+ per coin?
I really think the problem is no one knows how large the bubble will go, and why would you get out now, if there was potential for such substantial/radical growth..
I personally see it as an investment in a bubble-market, as opposed to (currently) a viable currency. 
Will that change? Good question. I don't see it shifting anytime soon; but the future may prove me wrong.
