What we really need is a solution which does not rely on proof-of-work (or at least does not rely on it this heavily), and a protocol in which 50% "market share" is not enough for an attack. 
Whether bitcoin would adopt such a hypothetical solution (which would be a very radical change), or die long term, is another question.
Satoshi showed that something which was thought impossible before is in fact possible, but that does not mean that what he found is the best solution, or even a somewhat good solution.

that's a classic catch 22: it would be faster if you made the transfer via bitcoin :)
@_date: 2014-02-03 16:03:31
I'm was talking about something completely different than what you think won't work. Also there was no talk about concrete attacks on concrete protocols, but hypothetical attack types on hypothetical protocols... 
In a proof-of-stake situation, there can be also a danger of that one party has too much money (though already 50% is very unlikely - look at the money distribution of the world: it's a few parties how control that much money, but not a single one). However, I think that this particular problem can be easily recovered from, for example with simply requiring 3 or 5 or whatever number of "lucky" people cooperating for each block. This makes the protocol more complicated, which is not desirable, but it definitely works in theory: If one party have 50% chance to be "lucky", then he will only have 12.5% to be lucky 3 times (so that he controls all 3 "parties"), and only 3.125% for being lucky 5 times. 
Similarly in a proof-of-work situation, if you require 3 lucky parties to cooperate, and even if one party has 50% cpu power, the other winner parties would have a say on what the block contains (clearly details are missing here). 
The frequency of blocks is basically an unimportant parameter, and in any case you can set that to be 10 minutes in average with whatever the protocol is. In fact I think the block gap distribution looks even better this way...

Yeah but I don't want to buy a phone just to use it on a single website. (I don't deal with large amounts, so I cannot see it as "security investment").
Not supporting plain SMS is a really bad idea (I guess Google could support it and then defer the (negligible) costs to Bitstamp - Google already has some kind of mobile phone support in almost all countries anyway).
@_date: 2014-04-11 14:11:31
fully agree
@_date: 2014-02-05 08:19:12


"chance" = "probability" (in the standard mathematical sense) in this context.
The idea was that there is not a single winner. Each time a block a produced, it is produced by three cooperating parties (the three can be of course controlled by one player secretly, but than chance for that is lower, that's the point). The three parties must somehow agree what the block will be (clearly, details are missing here). For example they can require that there's a large overlap in their sets of transactions to include. If they don't agree, the block is not produced (or not accepted by the rest of the network), and the whole thing is tried again (so this is vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack, but I don't think it's that bad actually). This way, probabilities multiply: if an attacker controls 50%, the probability that he controls all 3 winners (and thus can produce a "fake" block, whatever their goal is) is 12.5%.


Well I guess there is a point in that, but how is that not a problem right now? How long could in practice an attacker sustain such an attack? I'm not saying completely eliminate reorgs, just that events say 1 week ago can be in practice declared as set in stone (of course if the internet shuts down for 1 week, we would have a problem, but in that case we would have bigger problems anyway). If there is such a period before which the history is fixed, it is fairly easy to avoid the reorg attack, I think. 
We can probably count the number of medium-sized reorgs in the history of bitcoin on a single hand... 
Also, I think you can probably lessen this problem if you need some kind of proof-of-something together coming with a relay node, so it's not so cheap to run millions of them (say, it's not a complete solution, but makes an attack a little bit more expensive: you can partition the address space, have each node to carry a proof of stake of a minimum amount with a given address, and require clients to choose peers with addresses from different and random partitions) 
@_date: 2014-02-04 23:27:38


...except, each of those three addresses will have only 1/3 (or whatever is the ratio of the coins there) of chance, if the chance is linear with the stake (and only linear voting works, really). So it doesn't matter how many addresses the attackers have, just how many coins they control. Same for cpu power, though i don't like cpu power based voting anyway.


I believe that it is possible to fix that flaw. Part of the solution could be simply not accepting arbitrary reorganizations (I mean, even if tomorrow somebody magically came up with a totally new and valid and longer-than-the-current bitcoin blockchain, which branches off say 1 year ago, would people really accept it? of course not.)
@_date: 2014-02-01 13:56:07
I haven't talked about current designs, but possible designs. I think we don't really have a good understanding of the design space yet. 
But, to have something concrete (and simple): if you need say 3 lucky parties cooperating to produce a block (instead of one as in bitcoin), then if there is somebody with a 50% chance to be lucky, they still only have 0.5^3 = 12.5% chance to control all 3 "winners", and thus control the block.

Because n is also prime for this curve, any group element will have order n. That is, any point on the curve (except the infinity point) would be OK as a choice of G... Thus the choice of G seems to be somewhat arbitrary, unlike p and the curve equation (from which you can compute n, at least in theory).

@_date: 2014-02-01 09:01:18
I believe that there is a very large design space of protocols, and that we can design much better protocols than current bitcoin proof-of-work. In particular, I believe that there are variations of the proof-of-stake idea which should work much better than the present bitcoin protocol (to start with, I think you can design a protocol such that an attack requires, say, 90% of all coins, compared to 51% of the hashrate; and then we didn't even talk about the power consumption)

Hungary: Loans nominated in CHF (and to lesser extent other currencies) were vey popular, because the interest rate was *much* lower than HUF-denominated ones. Everybody and their mother took out CHF loans (free money! yay!). Mostly mortgage, but also for cars, etc.
The exchange rate risk was *not hedged* in any way (big mistake from both regulators and the banks).
CHFHUF rate blew up, people's monthly payment doubled, tripled, which of course they couldn't pay because they didn't take this possibility into account when taking the loan, and the banks gave loans to everybody (it's good business for them, too).
This was bad for both the people and the banks, but of course much worse for the people, who now still owed 2x the original amount after already paid 1.5x of the original amount (numbers vary). In the aftermath, foreign-denominated loans for laypeople were banned (instead of education and mandatory built-in safety features for these types of loans). After a looong time (way too late), existing loans were changed to HUF ones.

I think it's an interesting philosophical question whether storing wealth is a good thing or not. Of course we are really used to the notion of storing wealth, but one could imagine a society where that doesn't exist. I could definitely see advantages of limiting a little bit the storing of wealth. Eradicating it completely would be most probably an overswing, but some limitation could help overall, I believe. For example, you could limit inheritance. I think the extreme inequality in present society is in part caused by the notion of inheritance. Of course (?) you don't want to totally eliminate inheritance, but these are quite interesting questions to ponder on, to me at least.

One possible approach is to get out 10k when the price is a bit higher (say $1600 if you are really afraid, bit higher if your wife allows it), then you are back at the starting situation with dollars (so you can sleep well) and still have the upside potential of bitcoin.
Also maybe you should have been consulted with her before spending all the money on bitcoin? You should never put all your savings in such a risky thing, even if you really believe it.

No, your paper wallet is empty. 
The key to understand how it works is that there are no "wallets" or "coins"; there are only *transactions*. When spending the output of a transaction, the full value is spent. The remaining "change" is sent to a new address (which can in theory be the same as the original address, but this is discouraged, and the client used a new address in this case).
@_date: 2013-08-21 08:58:08
I think only 2 of 3 and maybe 3 of 3 works (as in, accepted as standard) at the moment. And even if you can do a custom transaction, m out of 20 is the maximum, so 7 out of 284 is out of question.
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:12:49
It's very simple:
Bitcoin is a much cheaper (and somewhat faster) way to transfer money than previously existing money transfer infrastructure.
It is still very new, but has a very high potential, that's why it is so volatile. If it will go mainstream (and if that happens, it will probably happen within a few years), the price will stabilize.
Also, I believe there are services out there for people like you which mitigate your exposure.
@_date: 2013-10-13 19:30:01
I'm not saying I have a better idea (though proof-of-stake could be interesting), I'm just saying that while almost all ideas of bitcoin looks pretty good to me, this one does not. Also my objection is proof-of-work in general, not the particular method bitcoin uses. Proof-of-work is wasteful by definition. On the other hand, it seems to work.

@_date: 2013-12-09 18:55:29
Indeed, I also think that digital currencies will stay. However, I can imagine bitcoin failing in a way so that the public loses trust in the general concept, and thus digital currencies won't widespread after for a long time (hard to regain trust). But hopefully this won't happen.

I think Bitcoin is way too risky to put 10% of your income in. Also, it's not "investing", since the coins just sleep, you don't lend them to others how make them "work" (normally savings go into bonds, stocks, etc. which should balance out inflation, and ideally give an extra profit over inflation).
However, putting 1-2% of your savings into bitcoins is a perfectly valid strategy - it is a very high risk, but possibly very high reward thing. But your total savings should be low-risk.

The community agrees to create the coins out of thin air, when a block is found. So yeah, strictly speaking it's not the miners who create them, it's the community. But they are created adhocly. I don't think the comparison to gold mining helps, exactly because superficially it looks similar, but deeply they are very dissimilar, and this causes a lot of confusion to people who don't fully understand the system.
The coins "don't exist", it's only the ledger of transactions what exists. The coins are invariants of this ledger.

Ok. What you have to understand, is that "coins" do not really exist as a digital data. Only transactions exist as digital data. When you say you have some amounts of bitcoins, that means that you own the private keys proving that you are allowed to spend the *output* of some previous transaction (for the chicken/egg problem, there are special transaction creating bitcoins out of nothing, given to the miners in exchange for their service). However, if two different people have the same private keys, both are allowed to spend - but only the first one will succeed, since double-spending is not allowed.
So in your case, two thing can happen:
* if the old wallet's coins are not spent since, then you can spend from the old wallet, and the spent money will also disappear from the new wallet (there is not difference between spending "from" the old wallet or "from" the new wallet, since the coins are not "there" at all).
* if you spent the output of the given transaction since, then spending from the old wallet won't succeed; in fact, when your client catches up with all the transaction history, it will show those coins in the old wallet already spent.
@_date: 2013-10-13 20:38:05
Ok, maybe a bad choice of words. The fact is that the paper gives very little details.
@_date: 2013-11-16 15:41:57
First of all back up up your wallet. After that you can experiment. Do you have the latest version? (8.5 I believe). If not, download it and try with that. Sometimes the block database can become corrupted. Deleting all the blocks (basically a fresh install, you only keep the `wallet.dat` file) probably helps, but takes a long time. You can also try the `-reindex` option before that.

How exactly is donating to the biggest public archive helps censorship??
I'm arguing that a full public archive sounds much better (to me, at least) than governments / big money censoring whatever they want (which already starts to happens in lot of *western* countries, check out the UK situation for example, or DMCA take-down notices - and then we are not even talking about oppressive governments yet), and that I cannot really imagine a middle road between the two (because any method for taking down stuff will be inevitably abused for censorship, exactly the same way it always happened in human history, including internet history; see above examples for a sample).
I'm all for privacy, but with cameras in every smartphone it's pretty much impossible that have privacy in public places anyway. If you put something on the *public* internet, yes it will stay there. The solution for that is to educate young people not to put everything on the internet without thinking.

Satoshi's paper is ~~of very hand-waving type~~ terse, but gives a good overview.
As far as I understand, the main concepts are:
* proof-of-work: get a consensus by vote-with-computing-power (not his idea by the way, and relatively expensive for the world, though probably much less expensive than printing cash). This uses hashes in an essential way, because the principal property of hashes is that the output is essentially random, and the idea is that you have to provide a small hash (for which you have to work)
* digital signatures: prove for the public that you really wrote that transaction
* in particular, bitcoin uses elliptic curve DSA, which is a rather [nice piece of mathematics](
* the idea that instead of "coins", we only have transactions (of course this does not help when you want to check the amount of coins on an address, but otherwise quite a good trick)
* the blockchain, as a ledger of global consensus
* the idea that the blockchain is maintained because the miners have financial incentive to do it - bitcoin is the purest form of capitalism I'm aware of. Economically, I think this is the biggest idea, and whether one thinks capitalism is good or bad, it seems to work
* hash trees of transactions - this is nice trick so that each miner has equal chance to find the next block independent of the number of transactions included, so that they have incentive to include all transactions (because of the fees)
* scripts: the transaction *is* a description of how one can spend the output. 99% of all transactions specify that one has to prove ownership of the target address (by signing the next transaction), but the idea is still nice, even though the community seems to be very conservative with general scripts
* the fact that addresses are hashes is not really important, but provides an extra layer of security
(NB. I'm drunk, so feel free to correct)
@_date: 2013-08-18 13:20:21
Actually, no. The beauty of the whole thing is that there are no coins, only transactions (see also "there is no spoon"). The fact that miners are rewarded with some coins for their work is purely a convention, and those coins are indeed created at that exact time, out of thin air. Miners are not "mining" for coins, rather they are providing a service (namely, maintaining the network) in exchange for some community-agreed reward (presently, 25btc + transaction fees). I think calling this whole process "mining" is very confusing, especially for non-technical people, and it would be much better for the community if it was called something else (as it really is something else).

It is very likely that the electrum source code will be still available in 5 years even if the software itself fails meantime, so technically, you will be able to reconstruct the private keys (even if that requires reimplementing the algorithms, it is still very doable, and very probably someone will actually do that if that will be necessary)
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:30:22


Of course this is very incorrect. "Coins" (\*) are created out of thin air each time a block is found. This is purely a convention, we could change it any time, except you will have a very hard time to convince the majority to change it.
(\*) "coins" do not really exist. It's only transactions which exist. "Coins" are invariants of the transactions, kind of an emergent phenomenon)

Futures (and option, etc) contracts are used to move risk from one participant to the other. If a merchant/factory needs to buy stuff now in USD but will sell the product 1 month later for BTC, they are exposed to the future BTC price. They don't want this (being able to plan is more important to them than the potential upside), so they can enter into a futures contract to "lock in" the future exchange rate. On the other side of the contract there can be for example a speculator.
Technically, I believe ICBit contracts are more like forward contracts, as futures contracts are usually continuously margined (but that's the only main difference)

If the core developers and the big miners (=pool owners) agree on the change, then the devs implement it, the miners include the changes into their version of the code, and the rest of us has basically no choice but to follow.
If they disagree about it but still make the change, that would be a hard fork, and we would get "old bitcoins" and "new bitcoins" (and you could spend your coins in both chains). This is very unlikely, as it would go against all interests, but it would be very interesting to see how it plays out. I think it wouldn't be that catastrophic, except for the loss of confidence in the general population.

You should look at the [logarithmic graph]( not the absolute graph. The current bubble is smaller (so far) than the April one, which is smaller than the 2011 one.
(in the case this needs an explanation: suppose you buy at $10 and sell at $20. Your profit will be exactly the same if you instead buy at $100 and sell at $200. The logarithmic graph shows this information: the difference between $20 and $10 is the same on the graph as the difference between $200 and $100, or $2000 and $1000)

My copy of blockchain is only 14GB. I guess the 17GB includes orphan blocks too? But that means a lot of orphan blocks. Also, is there a way to download all the orphan blocks (historically)?


I though that freshly mined coins are only spendable after 120 blocks? Or you mean that two (or more) consecutive transactions can be in the same block? In which case I find your sentence is bit misleading.
@_date: 2013-12-21 14:51:42
What I think is very unlikely is that two branches of the blockchain will be used in parallel.
Also, a crack in EC is much much more likely than a crack in SHA2 (which is by the way not a "protocol", but a hash function).
And even if EC is broken, you are still pretty safe as far as you spend from each address only once, because the addresses are (combined ripemd+sha2) hashes of the public keys, thus your public key is actually not at all public until you first spend from the particular adress.

Fees shouldn't make difference with definite directions (in this case, btc-e is always lower). Liquidity ditto, and in any case volume is in the same order of magnitude on btc-e and bitstamp. 
Now fiat processing is something I could understand, but the difference is about $7-$10, which seems to be too much. I'm only familiar with bitstamp, they have sepa in (free on their side, approx $10 on my side) and sepa out (1% on their side or something like that). The difference between btc-e and bitstamp is more than 5%, so I think fiat processing can explain only a part of that. (and as far as I looked into it, btc-e fiat processing shouldn't be significally cheaper anyway).

So, to summarize (TLDR): It is a synergetic union of several fine ideas. The only one I don't like is vote-by-cpu, it feels wasteful. Also the publicity of transactions is a drawback, but it's hard to imagine an alternative.
@_date: 2013-11-07 07:58:23
At the moment my problem is more the lack of features and bugs (I triggered some bug in multibit about 3 minutes after first firing it up...) than chaotic interface... I hoped multibit will offer at least some of the stuff I lack from bitcoin-qt, but apart from multiple wallets (which is not really well implemented either), it didn't. 
Though bad UI does not help either....
@_date: 2013-09-13 09:29:40
What I'm saying is that a clean re-design of the protocol would result in a fraction of the current complexity, and a huge improvement in elegance.

I now think that the top arguments against bitcoin are legal and technical, but mostly technical.
Legal: If one country (say the USA) bans it, they will just lose competitiveness (for both businesses moving abroad and because domestic businesses are not allowed to use superior technology). So this is probably not that big an issue.
Technical: There are lots of at least partially unanswered technical issues out there, for example:
* scaling it up (especially scaling it up *before* it really explodes)
* blockchain abuse
* too much centralization happening in mining
* will transaction costs stay low on the long term?
* long term energy consumption of the network (related to the previous one)
* technically better competitor appearing (eg. proof-of-something-else opposed to proof-of-work)
* the developers not reacting fast enough for some critical issue causing it to fail - people will either move to an alt or lose trust in the whole idea for a long time
I'm pretty sure there are more similar issues, which *may* cause problems in the future. 
@_date: 2013-09-05 06:40:26
Fair point, but I think the difference is usually small. 
On the other hand, if you want to compute expected earnings on a larger timescale (say months), you have to estimate the future difficulty, and to me it seems that future hashrate is again easier to compute with (ASIC company A is planning to dump X terahash on the market on T timeframe, etc)

But all mining hardware is specified by hashrate (and power consumption), never via difficulty. 
You just divide the machine hashrate by the network hashrate and immediately get the ratio of that machine's hashing capacity to the network. Multiply that by 2016*25 and you immediately see how much coin can you expect in two weeks.
With difficulty, you need some extra multiplications/divisions (I think).
@_date: 2013-12-21 12:12:38
No. It seems (to me) that basically nobody used that particular PRNG (it is very slow and there is no real motivation for it over other methods). 
Also, the bitcoin EC choice of secp256k1 (which was not a popular curve before; as far as I understand, bitcoin is the first major user) has nothing to do with the generation of private keys, and the EC PRNG issue has nothing to do with the security of the EC digital signatures.
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:10:45
I agree, except for the carbon footprint, which may be small compared to present day banking infrastructure (most probably, but very hard to estimate), but still feels completely wasteful. I'm sure there must be working protocols without such a waste, we just have to think harder.
btw, I think Stross is a great writer, and great thinker, even though I disagree with him on this particular post.

You shouldn't put more money into it that you can afford to lose. 
I believe in the idea (except the proof-of-work part, which works, but much less nice than the rest), not that sure about the protocol... 
@_date: 2013-11-24 11:42:38
The big exchanges (mtgox, bitstamp) have APIs where you can query the full transaction history (in small chunks). It needs some programming to massage the chunks into a database. Be careful though and try no to overload their servers!

decentralized markets. Probably takes more than one day though...
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:51:36
No. You could (in theory) change the protocol tomorrow. The 21 millions bitcoins is *not* the result of some master equation, it is purely conventional. If you change the block discovery reward in the protocol, this number will change, to anything between the currently existing amount of coins and infinity (*including* infinity). Now it would be very hard to change the protocol, because you have to convince all the others to do it. But there is nothing in the math preventing it. It's a purely social construct.
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:04:00
If you buy BTC with USD just beforing spending it, it makes the idea of bitcoin (cheap and easy transfer) pointless. It will cost more to you than just paying with USD.
For merchants on the other hand, it may make sense (at least until BTC goes mainstream) to convert BTC back to USD immediately, so that they don't have exposure to the very volatile exchange rate.

It would be easy and uncontroversial to change the protocol to allow for higher divisibility when/if necessary. BTC amounts are now stored on 8 bytes. You can increase that to 16 bytes, the blockchain will grow a little bit faster, but not too much, and that would allow almost 20 extra digits, surely enough for a few thousand years...
(Actually even with the current 64 bits you could easily get 10 decimal places instead of 8, I guess 8 was chosen so that people using Floats - which they shouldn't! - won't get too serious bugs, only little ones...)
@_date: 2013-09-09 08:28:43
Nah. Try this list instead: NVidia, AMD. End of list. Maybe Intel if you stretch it a little bit. I'm pretty sure all the above manufacturers use either NVidia or AMD chips, with only minor differences in card design.

I'm not really informed enough to state this as a fact, but afaik the only major pool accepting non-standard transactions is luke's one, and k-out-2/3 is the only "standard" multisig transaction.

Why does all bitcoin clients suck so bad? Seriously, I tried bitcoin-qt, armory and multibit. All of them suck donkey ass (ok, armory doesn't even work - and the machine I tried it on has 16gb ram, thank you) 
I'm using bitcoin-qt, but is so lacking in *very basic* features it is unbelievable. Like, moving my wallet file to somewhere else? Multiple wallets? Not showing my transactions/balance to everybody accessing my computer? Displaying the fucking change addresses?! Displaying the other end of a transaction?! Coin control? etc etc etc etc
Multibit is similar, except the "multiple wallet" part, but that sucks too.
Ok, I still have to try electrum, but I'm afraid it will suck too, or nobody in his right mind would recommend the others.
The good news is that this means that everybody here (including myself) is still an early adapter :)
@_date: 2013-09-04 19:43:48
In a similar way,
    your_share_of_the_network    = your_hashrate / total_hashrate
    expected_income_in_two_weeks = 2016 * 25 * your_share_of_the_network
Which I think is simpler than the above. So this is not really a good explanation of why difficulty is used instead of network hashrate.
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:57:49
Yes and no, but mostly, no. It is possible that electrum itself won't work (because the protocol changes), however you will be able to recover the private keys. 
I never tried electrum, but I'm pretty sure that all clients are able to export the private keys, and even if this is not the case, you (or somebody else, if you are not technically adept) can modify the source code to export them.
It is extremely unlikely that the protocol will change in a way which makes your old private keys invalid (to change the protocol, you need to convince almost everyone using bitcoin, and basically no-one would agree to such a change).
EDIT: To clarify a bit more, all you need to "own" the coins is the private key associated to the address, which is a single large number (256 bits. That's very large, but it's still a very short string; with the standard WIF encoding it's about 50 letters). If you have this number, even handwritten on a piece of paper, you are able to spend the coins (you have such a number for each address).
With electrum, as far as I understand, even these numbers are deterministically generated from one master seed so in theory you only need to write down a single larger number. Even if you have to re-implement the algorithm to generate the keys, it only takes some effort, and somebody else will do that work instead if necessary (as there are lots of electrum users today already).
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:42:28
yes. 
* 1,000 milli-btc in 1 btc
* 1,000,000 micro-btc in 1 btc
* 100,000,000 satoshi in 1 btc (this one is the outlier, not a power of 1000 like all the SI ones)
However nicknames like "bit" can be confusing now, as different people use mean different stuff by them. Stick to btc and SI prefixes until a consensus emerges.
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:13:21
The main point is that it is not a mathematical fact, but a social construct.
@_date: 2013-12-21 13:47:40
First, buying bitcoin is not "investing". It's speculation. Investing is something where your money is "working" (like putting money into a company).
Second, don't put more money into it than what you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2013-11-16 19:01:50
No, wallets are basically a collection of private keys (it may contain a list of transactions, but that's not too important). When you copy a wallet file to wherever your bitcoin client looks for it, the client will show the balances and transactions corresponding to that set of private keys (the addresses are uniquely determined by the private keys). 
So if you back up your current wallet, really safely (multiple places, etc), you can freely experiment with the old wallets (of course they won't show your current balance, because they don't have the newer private keys). 
After you are finished experimenting, you can just copy back your current wallet and continue as if nothing happened. Just be very sure that you actually have your current wallet, multiple copies, because if you accidentally overwrite the last copy of your current wallet, *then* some of your coins *will* be lost!
@_date: 2013-08-21 12:02:30


debug console syntax (2-of-3 example):
    createmultisig 2 '["1youraddress1", "1yoursecondaddress", "1thirdaddress" ]'
    addmultisigaddress 2 '["1youraddress1", "1yoursecondaddress", "1thirdaddress" ]' account_label
instead of addresses, you can also use hex-encoded public keys, but I guess addresses are simpler
json rpc syntax:
    {"method":"createmultisig"
    ,"params":[2,["addr1","addr2","addr3"]]
    ,"id":"some_unique_value"
    }
these create a multisig-*address*, not a transaction; then you can send coins to this address as usual, but you can spend only with 2 signatures. 
I think spending is supported in the satoshi client if all private keys are present in the wallet, but there is no explicit multisig support.
@_date: 2013-11-08 12:08:23
Yeah, this is a legal question. I was thinking (and writing) purely about the technical part, which by nature is something much more clear :)

Unfortunately, since the protocol itself is a huge mess, the resulting code wouldn't be a real piece of art even in a nice language... Though it would be much closer.

2 TH/s is pretty insane: Just 250 of such machines would be equal to the total current network! And the retail price of such a cluster would be "only" 4 million USD. Interesting times we are living in.

That's true, but if you have to choose between this and the opposite, I think it's better to choose ~~everything~~ most things archived. 
There isn't really a middle ground here, the world will converge to either full censorship or full public archive. 
@_date: 2013-09-13 09:01:36
Well I implemented a significant part of the protocol in a nice functional language. Based on that experience, I think I can safely claim that it *is* a huge fucking mess full of ad-hoc, completely undocumented, mostly unnecessary, clearly organically evolved idiosyncrasies. 
Note also that I didn't claim other wide-spread protocols are nicer.

1. You don't have to donate to the web archive, if you don't like it (but I did, a very small amount, because I like it).
2. I'm not saying complete loss privacy is unavoidable. I'm saying complete loss of privacy in *public places* seems to be unavoidable, and the internet is mostly a public place. 
Web Archive is special because they are doing a useful service (for some), they do it for free (funded by donations), and nobody else is doing it (ok, the NSA is probably also doing it, but they are not yet offering the result to you :) 
Also, if there are no public archives, then it is much easier for governments/etc to try and censor things. Ideally, there should be a *distributed* public archive (for example a torrent of the web archive, but that is not technically feasible)

You are confusing wallets with addresses (and/or private keys). A wallet typically contains lots of addresses (possibly "infinite", if it uses a private key derivation scheme). 
That said, I wouldn't store such large amounts in a single wallet even if it was distributed among many addresses (I probably would not use any existing wallet software).
