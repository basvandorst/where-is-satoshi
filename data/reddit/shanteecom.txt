You want to create a bitcoin address/ wallet while being totally independent , free of any third party website / company ?
Easy, look you won't even have to use your ISP connexion and not even the electricity generated by your state's power plants !
Run Ubuntu (not mandatory but that way you will avoid using Microsoft services) on a laptop powered by some photovoltaic generator. Download, or even better since you really want to be independent , write yourself your own PHP / python / javascript to create a bitcoin address and its private key.
I don't know much about math and  cryptography but perhaps it is possible to calculate an address + PK using a simple calculator and sheet of paper ?
Ok more seriously you can use a bitcoin client locally on your computer / phone  or manage your wallet on blockchain.info

Maybe , it might , it could be because of blablabla...What is the point of knowing now ? What if the best answer is "it's just like this"

As someone who lost quite some money on Gox I would love to know what is this address and who controls it

maybe when we will live under an other form and in a different plan beyond this physical reality then the things we exchange would for something else than money.
But now, if something is not exchangeable for money they we can say it's not a thing (maybe it's a thought..but still some thought / idea can worth billions)

I actually use the word "courriel" when I am writing but I tend to say "email or mail" when speaking.

That's about what I have lost on gox

I agree, but I still feel these "nano-tips" are useless , meaningless and somehow not really humane.
I said "meaningless" because in real life (and in the places I have been living anyway) most of the time when we tip somebody with money it's always with an amount usable to buy something like let's say a baguette (yes I am french :) a coffee, a burger, a bowl of noodle soup, a meal etc..
As for today, I would personally not know what to do with 0.000xxxx btc. I will probably let them rot wherever it is they stay. And I don't think I would be the only one. 
I believe if somebody receives a "normal tip" it just makes more sens.
I would not even try to know more about the person who sent me a dozen of bits or so, I might even believe some kind of bot did it but on the contrary I might very well notice when feeling hungry or thirsty that the amount of the hot chocolate I am buying is the same I received from "x" on internet, I will probably remember the context , the exchange I had with the person who tipped me etc..
I just feel it makes the whole thing more "serious", humane too. This a way a tip is not just a stupid click for the tipper and not just a kind of game for some other who try to accumulate tips  to get a single € some day but it simply becomes an act with a sens.


Good to know, thanks for this precision

Sure ! How many ?
@_date: 2014-04-19 16:07:56
Nobody is going to do an "instant sale" of 200k BTC on bitstamp or on any other exchange.
 It's just stupid ! If I was legitimately owning 200k btc I would never transfer all of them to some exchange and trade them. I guess I would sale a couple of thousands wait a bit , see what happens and reiterate.

Thanks , I am confused with small amounts :)
You're probably right , maybe I haven't noticed the more reasonable tips , or maybe I already spent too much time reading the dogecoin subreddit.


Well maybe they lost quite some money on MT.gox and so now they rather save the few bitcoin they have left :) or it could also be that they just haven't seen yet a post that is worth a "beer" because fortunately they are rare (otherwise spending a couple of hour on reddit would be quite expensive :)
@_date: 2014-05-18 13:58:06
exactly , why would he care ? Just like you don't care giving 79 μBTC
@_date: 2014-05-19 13:20:21
I haven't thought about it, I think I agree :)
@_date: 2014-05-18 11:50:34
and I need 30.000$ in bitcoin , since I have lost about 45 of them on mt.gox..unfortunately nobody will give them to me...I guess I 'll have to work to get it...Maybe you should do the same
@_date: 2014-05-17 10:46:14
Sure we could ! You could create your bitcoin institute or whatever you decide to name it but then what's the point ? What is it your new "Bitcoin Foundation" will do that the actual Bitcoin foundation doesn't do already ? (and  I might be wrong but it looks like they don't do much ..i still don't understand their function , goal )

Bitcoin is really convenient indeed, much more convenient than any other means of payment (to me anyway) it 's also accessible almost anywhere. But I still believe there is still quite some way before we can say it is "secure" ..
@_date: 2013-04-14 19:47:07
I am sorry but when you say 
*"they are the reason, why your BTCs are not accessible at this moment."*
I don't understand to who you are referring to  ? 
Who are "they" ?
why can't you check the balance of our accounts and send us our damn bitcoins ?
Or at least send the btc withdrawals that some people  did just before your stuff went wrong ?
I really don't understand this ! I can understand that you might have problems with you bank , and that they can hold some money for some reasons, but this has  NOTHING to do with BITCOINS ! 
You don't have our btc in a bank account !
