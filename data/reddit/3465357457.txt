uh... I'm pretty sure a fool can't be fooled again.

current network speed: 15,000 TH
1 kncminer Neptune: 3 th
3 * 5000 = 15,000
1 neptune = $10,000
5000 * $10,000 = $50,000,000
so your answer is $50 million.
Of course if you want the numbers in 28nm numbers, easy math included:
1 jupiter = .5 TH
0.5 * 30,000 = 15,000
1 jupiter = $5000
$5000 * 30,000 = $150,000,000
Still nowhere close to 2 billion.

but people who shoot mentally unstable people that are shooting at people would also be more likely to be armed, equilibrium.

Like USD makes any sense though.
Bitcoin makes perfect sense to me.
But USD? Why the Fed? It doesn't make any sense.  Why would they sell bonds to buy money to give to people? Why not just print the damn money or change the numbers in the ledger?
Interest rates. I started typing a long paragraph here, but am just going to leave it at the two words.
To say that system isn't more complicated than bitcoin seems crazy.

Every american should own at least one bitcoin.

OMG I have been waiting for this for so long.
This has been the missing piece for me to turn my pay entirely into bitcoin.

you are right exactly.
I would just like to add that I have heard asian cultures have a pause before the last few digits in their speech, which is why their money seems so much cheaper, they don't bother with the decimal before the cents.

David Clark is the father of Amanda Clark.  He was wrongly convicted of terrorist financing and was murdered in prison.
His daughter is quite the troublemaker, she has assumed a new identity and is working on getting revenge on the family that framed her father.
TCP/IP? That was years ago.

knc could sell their miners right now for the same price that they sold them for in november, they would make a fortune because the nre is done and they know what they are doing now.  
Tons of people would buy them and none of that hashpower would go to GHash.io
Yet they choose to not release new hardware, and it seems like nobody else is able to.
Ghash is a nefarious player, and with the amount of 'unknown' miners you could pretty much say bitcoin is extremely vulnerable right now.

I thought that perhaps an alt coin could be made.  A POW that crunches some sort of cancer fighting numbers.  I read somewhere that it's too hard to validate these calculations to use them for a POW, but why does that matter?  
If we are curing cancer here, does anyone care if it takes a month or two to confirm transactions?
The drug companies all have incentives to prolong cancer rather than cure it, I thought a DAC could fix that.
Secrets, patents, R&amp;D, is there a way to monetize leaked research that otherwise would never have been available to the public? I don't think we should pay attention to patents when it comes to saving people's lives.  Like guerrilla open sourcing.

I was trying to keep the math easy, but I guess you could call it $50,010,000.
Of course if KNC wanted to do a 51% attack I am sure it would only cost about 10% of that.
