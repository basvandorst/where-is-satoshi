I like this.... I operate a pizzeria as well in the san fernando valley area. I am gathering everything necessary to get a LN  node up and running as soon as possible. We already accept btc,ltc,zcash and ether for payments, very excited to get started.

That’s funny I initially did, but I realized while scanning with mycelium wallet it brought up a “legacy” address which was totally different than what my actual private Keyes were generating. However, segwit address was correct... If that makes sense. 
So I decided to make it fool proof by using the first legacy address my pk generated. At least mycelium scanned the correct address.

On a good week about 4ish, and almost daily conversations about Bitcoins. "Wow you guys accept Bitcoin? I'm trying to understand it" then we go ahead and give them the break down as much as time permits lol

Sure, as soon as it's a little bit more user friendly. Don't wanna scare off new comers to Bitcoin... It would require a new press plate but when that time comes it would be smart to add other cryptos in the "Pepperonis". 
@_date: 2019-09-22 08:25:42
Yessss BINGO!!! You forgot the 300k btu”s generating from the triple fryers

I've seen that in the pizzagate videos, this is a family operated pizzeria and rest be assured we don't support pedophilia. F*ck those guys 
@_date: 2018-07-20 10:22:18
Haha yes they are! The ones that still work with us and the ones that don't. I sent about $100 worth of btc around 2016 to our staff we had at that time it's safe to say they are still winning. They even got bcash out of it lol.
Yes volatility is the problem!
@_date: 2019-09-22 03:56:12
Barely 2 days. If you’re going trailer route shouldn’t cost you more that 55k if you want a truck it can be anywhere from 75 +. Make make sure it’s being built by a reputable shop, put everything on paper with milestones before releasing any money. 
They promised us 3 months, it ended up taking 6 months!!  Since we’re in LA we also need a commissary(place to park truck, dump grease, waste water) and some crazy insurance when you add that and payment for financing the truck gets to about $3000 a monthly.

Looking at this post gives me hope, still got fucking 50 + btc stuck in a trezor wallet.  Made this post about 2-3 years ago, that bounty is still on the table lol there has to be a way to access the btc in there. Does anyone know if decapping the mcu in it will be of any use if we I still don't have the passphrase? Whole lotta $$ just sleeping, or you guys think I should wait a bit longer for stronger cpu power in the near future then try to brute force the fuck out of it? 
@_date: 2019-09-22 02:19:48
Both LTC and ETH have potential to our eyes. Especially ETH, who knows maybe one day this turns into a franchise. I think smart contracts will be useful for all kinds of business protocols.
@_date: 2018-07-19 23:13:55
Ahh man why can't we get away with just appreciation and spreading the word.. we sell about about 100 pizzas a day  that means a 100 people will see that beautiful B when they order from us..

It’s hard to say for now but yesterday was grand opening and we’ve had two people pay with crypto so far.

It's not exactly fully within it if we wanna get into details lol... On the other hand it's art so whose to say what you can or can't  make out of it... It's just people's minds are so polluted with such things, we can't blame them for resembling pedophilic symbols.
What better graphic would be used to express Pizzaholic? It's a heart shaped pizza with "pepperonis" and a Bitcoin symbol in one of them with a bigger heart surrounding the heart shaped pizza from half way...  How else would you express "love for pizza" or "Pizzaholic" in a 3 color illustrator file? 
Original artwork was a slice of pizza, within a slice of pizza eating a slice pizza... That's another  "pedophilic" symbol since we can say that it's a triangle within a triangle right? And to make matters worse it can be considered "cannablistic"  because if you we are what we eat and what we eat is pizza then what does one become? 
It's unfortunate that pos people like that exist but those kind of people don't get love from this side that's FOR SUREE!
@_date: 2019-09-22 00:59:24
No, it’s not really offensive it is MILDLY offensive haha. Well, best way for them to catch on is to see other businesses accepting. So it’s a decent start....
@_date: 2019-09-22 02:37:26
You know we are not going to knock them, they are one of the og’s when it comes to Nashville Style hot chicken and they have good food. 
We have been getting a lot of positive feedback as far as taste goes besides from friends and family. For some weird reason yelp keeps on putting all our reviews in the not recommended section. We have about 10 reviews and 10/10 are filtered.... All from random customers ��
@_date: 2019-09-22 04:23:05
Can’t tell sarcasm ��
@_date: 2018-07-20 20:05:40
That's a really neat idea actually, or have some type of label printer that generates qr code with payment amount. So it's good for about 45-60 mins, then we can slap it on the boxes before sending out.
Permanent qr code print will be cool on the side of the pizza box, where people can donate in btc which can be dispersed to none profit organizations or x amount of pizza made and delivered to local community services ?
Sure we'll ship the dough(will be perfectly fermented by the time it gets there), sauce, cheese just make sure your local pizzeria has a brick oven haha
@_date: 2018-07-20 05:30:22
Sure man

It's a fun experience when you buy things using crypto. My dream would be to franchise this business and make it a block chain operated pizzeria from kitchen to corporate LN compatible! Instead of holding stake in company using Fiat or stocks, using Bitcoin and tokens. Also have a Crypto ATM machine installed at every location. Whose in??! 
We have been accepting Btc,Ltc,Eth,Zec, and Dash for over 3 years now

That’s awesome! love the idea, anything to take the shit coins out the game lol. There are a few things we need to complete which are priority as soon as that’s done I will for sure set it up.  Thanks
@_date: 2019-09-22 00:55:17
Lol good question....If it doesn’t belong to shit coin category then ALL DAY.
@_date: 2019-09-22 22:50:23
Well with exchanges it’s a total different story, they need that many confirmations for security issues. 
Yes 1 confirmation for bitcoin is ample especially for transactions under 20 bucks. We have hardcore hashpower nothing to worry about. It’s just that some wallets don’t show anything until 1 confirmation and then you have to go check on the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-07-20 01:44:42
Lol no they are made fresh to order and come out of a brick fired oven.  Pizza sauce is made in house, dough is made in house as well. Too bad we don't have a cow farm, cheese would be made in house too haha 
@_date: 2018-07-20 03:48:52
Around 4 within a 7 day time frame, sometimes none. Ones that have used crypto were all about it I mean actually asking to take a pic with us excited! Sometimes we need to remind them to not let their food get cold because of all the questions we get asked lol no lie.

How much do you want for the bitcoin pizza ladies man picture?
@_date: 2018-07-20 05:26:33
Currently it's not that much of an issue, rather just hold the crypto. When we see higher volume, we would have to cash out a certain amount for food cost, labor, etc. Which will be a bit heartbreaking... All the profits will remain in crypto and ONLY crypto not worried about that part what so ever.
Got into mining late 2013 with a great friend of mine. Back in the KNC Jupiter and Neptune days lol. So it's safe to say we have seen Bitcoin at it's worst, the $1000 swings don't phase us. We're in it for the long run!!
As for supporting stop by if you can one of these days... crypto accepted �� and help spread the word ONLY if you like the experience and pizza lol

Will an Instagram link do sir?
@_date: 2018-07-20 02:47:44
We for sure accept Bitcoin and many other crypto currencies... We usually send a qr code when there is a delivery order, if it's walk in then customers scan the qr right there and then send.
Didn't want to use Bitpay, but we have been looking at the Coingate plugin. Looks like it has potential.

We’ll let the banksters have that one ;-)

Yes we wait until transaction comes through but, we can't wait for confirmations every time or else customers will really get disappointed. We believe in the network so much that don't sweat it when it comes to confirmations.

I see a lot of potential in lite coin because it’s very efficient when it comes to spending for everyday things. Don’t get me wrong Bitcoin is the daddy but not very practical for small and quick payments. I rather have the payments clear instantly. Plus it’s all going to get converted to Bitcoin anyway lol 
Yes I wouldn’t consider ETH sound money either but still doesn’t mean that it can’t be useful in the future. It’s one big experiment for now with a long way to go before becoming useful. So be it if I don’t get to see the benefits of it maybe my future kids will.
