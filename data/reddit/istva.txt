Yep. Volunteered to a county shelter (pound) in 2011-2012, the amount of purebred (well, atleast to my naked eye) dogs that peaked RIGHT after January 10th was astounding. My supervisor told me they hated the Holidays because they dealt with this every single year. 
In one day we received 3(!!) pugs, 2 corgis and a gorgeous siberian husky (with the 1 blue eye, 1 brown eye) - every one of these were PUPPIES (under 6 months old). 
I'd like to say all the pure-bred(esque) dogs we received were all adopted, but unfortunately, they weren't. We work with local rescues to get as many dogs transferred (purebreds and mutts included) as soon as possible, even calling rescues 300-400 miles away. Nothing makes you feel more like a failure when you see a sweet dog transferred to the kill-list and you never see them again, knowing you can't do anything about it, and at that time I was already fostering 8 dogs and that was a struggle for just one person.

Buying a pure bred dog does not remotely safe guard you from having to deal with personality issues (i.e. aggression or inability to be trained) OR critical medical issues, some that are unique and only appear in purebred dogs, since the overwhelming majority have low-diversity in their genes. Purebed dogs aren't 'healthier' than mutts, variation in genes matters greatly for a healthy dog's longevity.
If you think a place like PetLand (which is what the store above looks like) gives you a credible past medical history, and not just the b.s. the puppy mills tell them when they sell them in batches of 50 to each store, then you're fooling yourself.
