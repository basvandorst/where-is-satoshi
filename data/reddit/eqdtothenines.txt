As long as bitcoin is a currency I'm going to want to know if it's going up or down, your currency is only worth how much it is worth. Just as I check my Canadian dollars against American.

Of course formats can be vulnerable. Look at viruses being stashed in jpgs. If a format allows itself to be abused it's vulnerable.

Ya, I'm going to go with if there is a vulnerability no program is safe.

I don't think you know how viruses and malware work, they are A LOT more sophisticated than you think. Doesn't matter how long your passphrase it when you got infected browsing a compromised site and everything you do is logged. Once these currencies gain more traction and people are holding hundreds of thousands of dollars, wallets are going to be prime targets by the most talented crackers.

You think this is the last incident for an unregulated currency, you'll be sorely mistaken. I can't wait until the day your wallet gets stolen too and no one will be there to have your back.

I don't think you know what usually means.

People are dumb, fuck I hate people.

Why is that the programs fault though? It's reading the format correctly. The format allowed the code to be hidden within itself. The decoder is just doing it's job. I see it as the chicken or the egg.

I'm going to piggy back on this comment so people hopefully see why he deserves life.
Should drugs be decriminalized? Yes. But they also need to be extremely well respected. They can be extremely dangerous. Some can kill or harm you just because of certain genetics in your family. You have no idea where they were made or what adulterants were in the finish product. Or even what you got was what you got, because many people have been seriously hurt by that or killed.
There needs to be widely available information on the drugs and help you can seek after if they ever had a death grip on your life.
There are so many things that need to be thoroughly planned for decriminalization it would take thousands of pages to write about.
Now who knows how many people were harmed, killed or lives ruined because of all that I mentioned above. You want change? Fine. But not like this, it made it way too easy for anyone to get anything they want without and safety behind legal / decriminalized drugs.
And don't even get me started on how many designer drugs that were on there with no data behind them or very little.

It is a flaw, this is what happens when you're solely responsible for your coins. Banks may like to fuck you over with fees, but they've always had my back in protecting my money.

It's just too easy.

Ya because everyone on silkroad was a mature 21+ year old, get real.
