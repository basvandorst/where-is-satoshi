Congratulations! My birthday was yesterday and I took the price drop as an opportunity to buy a little more as a present to myself! I think it's a good time to get into the game now so kudos!
And try not to hoard all of your coin! We have to spend some of it to show our support. Hoarding it doesn't retailers interested! You can always buy more to replace what you spent!

Cool! Is there a reason most Farmers Markets are on Thursdays? Everytime I find one on a weekday, it's a Thursday. Maybe it's just a coincidence.

Don't let hear you ask that :)

I used gyft to purchase a gift card for 1-800Flowers and paid that way. Not quite as easy as the merchant directly accepting BTC but not that big of a deal anyway :)

I downvoted for asking for karma but also upvoted because I thought it was legitimately funny at the same time. So... there you go then

It's such a well-crafted joke too.

Sorry if this is off-topic but how often is the Farmer's Market in Atlanta and how often do you guys go to it?

I think I own all (or most of) the games that are sold. Bought one anyway to give to some friends. Thanks!

Check out Gyft if you haven't already. You can use it to buy gift cards for places like Amazon. Then you can buy anything you want!

This is actually good news

You'd rather they not ensure your anonymous internet transaction is your own?
