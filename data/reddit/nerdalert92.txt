This has been a long and rather aggravating conversation so I'm going to choose not to participate anymore. Feel free to have the last word below, however.

Given the increasing prevelance of BTC ATM's even here in my pretty small area I would say the economy is doing just fine for btc. Until the blockchain is complete even an investor with what you refer to as a "cold wallet" is still supporting that chain by purchasing it for investment purposes. I understand your desire to get it accepted by more merchants but even in my relatively moderate research over the years I've seen a huge rise in the amount of merchants accepting all sorts of cryptocurrency. My local healthfood store accepts bitcoin, litecoin and ethereum for example. I just don't think there is any great need for convincing investors to spend some of their btc regularly.

I think I'll keep "hoarding" my 1.2 BTC.....I mean I do microtransactions here and there but mostly I'm in this for long term returns. The BTC economy is growing and I don't think it's necessary to "guilt" long term holders into abandoning a good investment.

Yeah I didn't bring up the wallet types myself, not sure how that became a part of the conversation, really. Anyway, BTC is going to continue to be generated for another decade or so. When that production stops and the price peaks, will begin to use mine more frequently as currency. Higher the price, less I have to use to get the same product. It's simply the smartest thing I could do. I am on mobile and can't paste your absolutely lovely last paragraph here to respond to it directly, but I appreciate your complimentary personal opinions........and will continue to hold my btc lol.
