The tech industry is very anti Trump. Why? BTW signed up for Reddit just for this AMA.

Hah. Thanks for that bit of HRC nostalgia. If there are those that are secretly pro Trump and those that are openly pro Trump, where does that put the numbers?

Her politics are from abnormal and shouldn't be subjected to a liberal inquisition ... her guy won the election. You lefties attacked her physically because of a hat she was wearing and that's the point.  Get a grip on reality.

Everyone gets that you hate Trump.

That's interesting.  Something I have noticed watching the various forms of media is how hostile we have all become, me included.  I'm curious about Ancap.  When I have more time I might ask you some questions, if that's okay.

Me too.

Pretty sure Trump doesn't give a rats ass about whether someone is gay or not.  He is a product of Manhattan.  Secular. Worldly.  Doesn't care. Likes to build shit and  because he is a proud American.

That's a good point, he said "they let you grab them by the pussy."

Wow.  Someone deserves to be assaulted for supporting a Trump.  Just wow.

Baloney.
