Wish I had some kind of time rewinding machine.
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:12:44
Upvote it, people needs to be aware of it.
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:10:55
100% agreed.
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:07:15
Why did you sell your lambo?
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:13:47
Coinbase has more than one problems.
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:39:33
I would contact their support and ask what happened.
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:21:30
That could be the best Christmas present for a hodler.
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:22:09
Coinbase? They are too busy to answer their customers, guess they just don't care about their community.
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:31:30
Now you gonna be proud while wearing this tshirt.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:23:06
Thanks for heads up, upvote this so more people can see it.

Interesting article to read
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:11:10
can't wait to lay my hands on one of the bad boys
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:53:29
You have no idea how awesome it looks, greatly done!
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:08:37
Do you think buying now would be a good choice?
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:47:30
Maybe if they can get lightning network in 2018
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:20:18
Not a proper sub to discuss that

BTC has been featured on various shows lately, it's great.
@_date: 2018-04-16 05:46:58
RIP to their investment lol
@_date: 2018-04-13 12:42:49
That's what happens when you try to get away with people's money...
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:50:00
Cryptowat.ch does this exact same thing, doesn't it?
@_date: 2018-04-05 15:55:45
Definitly something shady going on with Simplex.
@_date: 2018-04-10 01:05:46
Interesting to see how the regulations will play out. Seeing the older generation accepting it is a VERY good step towards adoption
@_date: 2018-04-05 04:52:10
But did you buy an eclair using BTC?
@_date: 2018-04-10 00:56:13
Is this relevant to Bitcoin due to them accepting Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-04-05 06:27:48
Hey, great question. Following this. I'm sure there is a fix in the works/already happened.
@_date: 2018-04-17 16:25:28
Interesting to read, but that won't happen in the next 100 years for sure. There are still flaws and the goverment won't allow us to take control over our money.
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:49:04
And that's what should make it more stable, yet price just rises.
