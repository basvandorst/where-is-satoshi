And then one guy is having a bad day, or (and this has *never* happened before) a sociopath manages to rise to power somewhere without anyone noticing what they are.  Or someone is just plain governed by emotion.  Or someone says "Dude you took my horse" and the other guy only speaks Spanish and the plaintiff's translator asks "Did you recently get a new [male horse]?"  and Dude says "No, but I just bought a mare" and then everyone who speaks Spanish shittily is like "What do you mean you don't have a horse [genderless because we're speaking English again]" and lynches Dude.  
Or one group starts thinking another is weird, and then someone from the weird side's son gets too grabby at the local fair and suddenly shit's hitting the fan.  
Ever seen Men in Black?  To paraphrase, 


I agree that we tend to get a lot of sociopaths and assholes running the government as it is, but at least they're getting filtered through a large &amp; stable society that makes sure they generally agree with what everyone else considers normal standards of decency.

The attorney has recognized income &amp; will be taxed on it in 2017.  The amount received becomes his basis in that particular chunk of BTC, and when he eventually sells it it will be treated as capital gain property so gain/loss and tax rate will be determined by the market value when sold as well as the holding period.
