I was waiting for someone to say something like that 
@_date: 2014-01-14 08:27:35
No, but I recommend Malwarebytes. Just don't download random stuff and visit sketchy websites. Check you control panel for suspicious programes running 
@_date: 2014-01-23 09:49:11
Awesome! I'm gona transfer to this network. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 11:22:40

Bitcoin drop party. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 14:54:10
Nice! Bitcoin is fairly mainstream. A teacher at my school is kinda obsessed with it. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 17:25:18
I'm going to be buying BTC daily so I don't think Localbitcoins will be suitable. And I don't really trust Zipzapinc for some reason.

What a fine day it is to be alive duds
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:48:03

*cries*

It's possible for them to accept bitcoin, but I dout they will. It will cost a lot of money setting up the new payment and could cause legal issues. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 19:34:11
I do have my concern, within it bitcoin industry everything always seems to go tits up and people loose money.
@_date: 2013-11-07 10:01:08
Thanks man :D
@_date: 2013-11-07 19:33:31
I'm not really getting it. Should I not mine?
@_date: 2013-12-25 16:01:58
I live in the UK, I've heard of Local Bitcoin. But no one is local...
@_date: 2013-11-08 14:54:47
Bitcoin is virtually impossible to get without a bank account, no reputable websites sells them without. Only think I can suggest is finding a private exchanger 
@_date: 2013-11-11 11:42:12
Step 2: Dont be a retard.

Brb going to China 
@_date: 2013-11-15 14:51:28
It's stupid that they as brining out so many new products before they have even shipped the ones that have been out for nearly a year. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:54:41
You never know their trust worthy. You just got to take the chance. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 14:51:36
The bitcoin miner is not a kind of malware which will hurt/steal your stuff. People make them to silently mine Bitcoins from your computer. Usually if you find a silent miner you could be apart of a bigger botnet or such. I would recommend reinstalling windows. When you upload your wallet.dat. Simplay make a new wallet and transfer them to the new one.

I should mention the origional bitcoin Waller doesn't want to work on my computer for some reason 
@_date: 2013-11-30 13:57:57

@_date: 2013-11-11 14:49:19
Bitcoin has been on the news a shit ton for a few months, so I guess that would of helped the rise of peeps 
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:29:23
Wow! Thanks allot man!
Merry Christmas!
@_date: 2013-11-25 14:57:22
How about people stop spamming this shit everywhere. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:04:07
I have no clue. But it is addictive, you dot want to do it personally. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 11:59:04
It's a good idea but I bet people who don't know what Bitcoins are will just forget or throw it away. You defo need an expiration date one it. 
Good idea!
@_date: 2013-11-11 08:16:36
Except ugly ones.  
@_date: 2013-10-08 20:00:56
We all knew it wouldn't be long untill it's back up again.
@_date: 2013-11-11 14:52:41
Tell me about it! I was going to buy some Bitcoins when they where around $50~ But my friend advised me not to buy them. No I see there $300~ It pisses me right off. 
Thanks allot @_date: 2013-11-28 11:18:14
It might do, but metric shit ton of Bitcoins will be bought to.
