The rich can afford finding ways to avoid that. All the others are pretty fucked. The have mandatory social contribution of 13% of their gross salary. Progressive taxes are calculated after that is taken away from the pay. Lowest bracket is 25% but the first 8000 € or so are exempt. 
Oh, employers have to pay an employment tax of 35% flat of the gross salary of each employee.

Dictatorship seems fine to me. As long as I'm the one in charge of course.
