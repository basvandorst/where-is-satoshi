I'm from the New York area. 
Well, there are multiple steps of verification. The first step, which allows trading up to $1,000/d requires only full name, date of birth, country of residence, and phone number, which is simple enough. However, the site sent me an email after I submitted that telling me the service isn't available in my area. Without this step my limit is $0/d. 
I guess I have to wait and find out if the email was a fluke.

Is that accounting for the increasing difficulty of mining bitcoin?

When did you buy it? You may have bought it during a rise - last night it was worth $900 per coin at one point, it's now ~$700. Also, price of bitcoin depends on the exchange. Preev is probably using Mt. Gox while blockchain is probably using Bitstamp or something else.

Just buy and hold, my friend. Welcome!

No need to defend yourself against stubborn redditors. Thanks for the tip :) although I can't say it was unexpected. Brands like Starbucks whose demographics resemble bitcoin's were bound to be one of the earliest adopters. We just now have a much clearer idea of when. 
By the way... How many bitcoins do you own? Just wondering what people consider to be a "decent amount."

Trojan horse reported from that site. (avast)

Is there anything in place to stop everyone on the server from botting?

Ah, forgot about money orders as I never use them. Looks like the wire transfer option hasn't been released yet however.

Looks like the majority consensus is that the price is locked in when you buy, assuming they're not out of bitcoins. Thanks! Looks like I made some money then.

Dammit! Thanks.

I got this email from them when I signed up and went through the verification process this morning. I'm from the US: 


Are you from the US or EU?

Just this afternoon I was thinking, "Huh, there's got to be at least one chump who bought at $800 and sold at $500," and here he is! In a spectacular fashion too.

Can you trade on BTC-E if you're from the US? I've tried all of the options but they seem to all be Europe-based. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:38:31
Hmm. Do I trust you or pierebel?

I believe CoinMKT only accepts payments from OKPay and Egopay, both of which don't currently accept US payments.
