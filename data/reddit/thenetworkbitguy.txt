I believe that there is no future for those. They are not connecting and working hard enough to make connections with high rollers/ banks and so on.
My investment looks like this:
60% - BTC 
25% - Ripple(XRP)
15% - Ethereum
BTC will be the gold of cryptos
XRP will be used for transactions
ETH will be used like a cloud and other high capacity programs to make them run together.

The Answer to this question is pretty clear. No. There will not be a fix of this issue if you don't move your investment to an alt coin. IMO and predictions, bitcoin will be gold and another coin like ripple will be used for transactions. It seems like ripple is moving in the right direction but removing the idea of decentralized currency.
No, another alt coin will be the future of transactions and bitcoin will remain as gold.

Coinbase is great for BUYING bitcoins. You should not keep them their IMO. I use Ledger Nano S to store My bitcoins and altcoins.
But yes, coinbase.com is a great start!

Plzzzzz give me bitcoin! 
jokes aside, Love the work you're doing. But in my opinion, I would rather like to see you give them to people who is really in need. Or use the money to spread knowledge and give (new people) a small amount like $10 in BTC to start with.
Best regards The NB guy!
