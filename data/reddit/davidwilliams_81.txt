I'm happy to hear that I might be able to save on the cost of buying a YubiKey, but on the other hand I really want my bitcoin hardware wallet to be as simple as possible *to minimise the risk of any bugs and/or vulnerabilities*. So overall I am torn on this.
@_date: 2016-08-28 22:43:46
Thanks, but any reason why you choose copper?
@_date: 2016-08-28 22:40:51
While I appreciate your input, I think at the moment I am more concerned about losing my seed rather than having it stolen through physical means. I have a secure firearms box which should thwart the average attacker, and if threatened by the government or with physical injury I would probably just hand over my keys as I don't have enough Bitcoins to justify a risk to my health. I may think differently if Bitcoin goes to the moon :-)
@_date: 2016-08-27 10:23:44


Bitcoin addresses are already smaller that 256 bits (160 bits if I remember correctly) which means that there are on average 2^96 private keys which correspond to each address. Other parts of the system use 128-bit cryptographic primitives ([see here]( meaning that overall the system provides 128-bit security (at least that is my understanding).
2048^12 is 2^132, so the seed length is not the week point.


I don't know how it's done, but I would assume it is explained in BIP39.
@_date: 2016-08-28 22:24:52
Also 'p', 'd', 'q' and 'b' :-) But actually seeds are not case sensitive anyway.
@_date: 2016-08-27 06:07:48
Yes, this is correct. Assuming Mycelum uses [BIP39]( then the English wordlist is here: 
Note that it only has 2048 entries, so your phone can guess which one you are entering fairly quickly.
@_date: 2016-08-28 22:26:26
Thank you! Cryptosteel is great of course, I was just interested in finding out about other options.


Yes, this would be a limitation, but in my case I will keep the seed in a safe location.
@_date: 2016-08-28 22:43:10
Chemical etching is another idea I hadn't thought of. Actually I used to make PCBs as a kid using UV light and Something-Chloride to mark and etch a copper surface. I'll look into this, but at the moment I think etching with a drill is probably easier.

Wow, very interesting. Here's a [direct link to the photo album]( for those interested.
Probably a bit more fancy than I was after and I actually want to store a wallet seed rather than private keys, but thanks a lot for sharing!
@_date: 2016-08-28 22:35:22
This is my favourite idea so far. The idea of engraving with a drill had not occurred to me and it seems both easier and more robust than stamping tools. I'll investigate this further.

Very interesting. For a while I have had an idea for a programming project which would take a Bitcoin address/key, generate a QR code as a 3D model, and combine it with a user provided 3D model. This would let you add a QR code to the bottom of a 3D printed vase, statue, etc.

@_date: 2017-12-21 00:03:21
Correct. If you enter the same seed into two separate Ledger Nano S's then the devices become identical. Either one can then be used to log into your wallet and/or send transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:20:59
You just have to use the same seed on each. Generate the seed on one, write it down, and then enter it on the other.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:04:46
Yes. As long as you have your seed words you can always recover your coins. Either with another Ledger, or I think there is also a software recovery tool somewhere.
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:07:42
They would then have access to your coins, which is why you should keep your seed somewhere safe.
They will not guess your seed by chance as the odds are ridiculously low. It's like guessing your private key - possible *in theory* but in practice it will never happen.

[Samourai Wallet]( for those wondering. I've heard good things about it.
@_date: 2015-06-10 11:27:42
This is probably the worst thing you can do. Coins transferred near the time of the fork are the most likely to be lost, whereas old coins will safely exist on both chains. And you can still spend them on both chains if you have the private keys, which you won't have if you send them to Coinbase.
Coinbase will probably do the right thing - but you don't need to worry about that if you just leave them in an address which *you* control.

This guy has a point - I feel that 2007 - 2009 was particularly slow for Bitcoin. Seems to have picked up since though!
@_date: 2014-08-04 12:15:58
Thanks, this does look like a valid approach. Of course, it would be nice to validate the address using a different tool to the one which generated the address (as otherwise any bug might not be revealed).

I do agree (and on previous Moronic Mondays I have asked how I can verify the key/address pairs generated by any given tool), but that's somewhat tangental to the issue at hand. Firstly I'm interested in whether such HD paper wallet generators actually exist (or even make conceptual sense), after that I can worry about their security/implementation issues.

@_date: 2014-10-13 20:05:32
Huh, you know it's kind of obvious but I didn't actually think about this approach. I was busy looking for a tool which would do the whole pipeline for me, but actually I can generate a list of HD address with a tool such Electrum and then just manually enter some of the private keys into the paper wallet generator.
This also gives me a chance to check that the key pairs are really valid as they'll be check by more than one application.

**Can I use BIP38 to encrypt my public address as well as my private key?**
The benefits of encrypting a private key are well understood, but it seems like encrypting the public address could occasionally be useful as well. For example, this would let me hide my balance from anyone who obtained my BIP38 paper wallet. Perhaps not as useful as encrypting the private key but it seems like this should be a trivial extension. Can anyone tell me if it is possible?
P.S. I asked this previously and didn't get an answer (maybe there isn't one!) but thought I'd try again :-)

@_date: 2014-06-14 19:15:25


Sure, but then do they leave their SHA-256 miners running for the 10 minutes that Scrypt is required? Can you power a farm of ASICs on and off every 10 minutes of so? With several different algorithms, most of the ASICs would be idle most of the time.


Sure, I guess this would be a hard-fork. The protocol would dictate that if the previous hash was an odd number then the next block should be hashed with SHA-256, otherwise it should be hashed with Scrypt. So it's entirely deterministic and all nodes agree on which algorithm should be used, but they don't actually find out until it's time to start mining the block.
@_date: 2014-11-03 07:23:31
Doesn't work for me... what language, locale, and layout are you using? I have to resort to ALT+0181 which isn't so easy to remember (not that AltGr+m is great).

Perfect, thank you. So by signing a message you prove you have the private key corresponding to the address, and this is essentially the same (mathematical) process as signing a transaction.

So I'm running Armory on a machine which is only on a few hours a day, and without a great network (WiFi). It seems my port 8333 is closed which is then probably for the best, but am I still hurting the network? There's still the overhead of downloading the blockchain of course. Maybe I should switch to Electrum or something.
@_date: 2014-10-20 14:06:01


Actually I believe that *each iteration* of cracking BIP38 is significantly more expensive than *each iteration* of cracking a private key. That is, testing a randomly chosen password against BIP38 is deliberately an expensive operation, whereas converting a randomly chosen private key into a public address is a very cheap operation.
This means that BIP38 passwords can be much shorter than private keys, while still being resistant to brute-force attacks. Can someone confirm my understanding?
@_date: 2014-05-09 19:20:01


I don't think it would make any difference. If Dorian is Satoshi then he can easily post (and sign) a message saying he isn't.
@_date: 2014-06-14 19:30:18




Sure, but I feel that reducing ASIC's would still be a step towards decentalization, as it lowers the barrier to mining.




Well, I think I have enough basic knowledge of the protocol to propose this as an idea. Are you saying that my idea can't be implemented, wouldn't fix the problem, is an improvement but not a solution, or just makes things worse?
@_date: 2014-05-09 14:52:38


I think that might be what happens? From the article:


It doesn't say that it's a *Bitcoin* private key, nor that there is a public address listed. So perhaps it works as you suggest.
@_date: 2014-08-04 12:14:52
A valid approach, but this also turns my paper wallet into a hot wallet (it's no longer offline).
@_date: 2014-08-01 12:59:54
I think most people just aren't really interested. But if they are going to be held to a discussion then they have to form an opinion one way or the other, and being anti-bitcoin allows them to just get on with their life as they were, without having to justify why they are not getting involved.
I think this is probably true when evangelising *anything*.

**Deterministic addresses**
As I understand it, a deterministic address lets you generate an infinite series of addresses from a single seed. But when you import this seed into a new client, how does the client know how far to search through the infinite sequence? I don't think you can force only consecutive addresses to be used. Does wallet software only actually search the first thousand or million addresses in the sequence, or something like that?
**Edit:** Thanks guys! So it seems that used addresses are generally expected to be continuous, with a user configurable 'gap' being used to handle the case when they are not.

Looks like they are running this tool: 
@_date: 2014-08-04 12:22:38
The checksum protects against mistyped addresses but I don't think it ensures the address matches the key. I believe the process is :
1. Generate random private key.
2. Derive public key and address.
3. Compute checksum on address and append it.
If step (2) goes wrong (just though a bug) then a valid checksum will be computed on the wrong address.
I do agree BitAddress is probably fine. It would just be nice to have an easy way to check :-)
@_date: 2014-06-14 19:21:08


Except I don't think it would hinder CPU/GPU miners to the same degree.


Yes, but only a some of your miners are active at any given time. The rest are idle - or can you power your farm off and on every 10 minutes? This would seem difficult for a large farm.


Agreed, even if ASICs don't exist, people still can (and do) pool their CPU/GPU miners. So it doesn't solve the pooling problem, but I feel less ASICs should help decentalization.


Sure, and as I understand it something like this is also being worked on (CPoS?). I'm just trying to open up another idea really.
@_date: 2014-05-29 13:23:10

**(Answered) How can I verify that I have a correct private key without performing a transaction?**
I often generate paper wallets using BitAddress.org and have never had any problems, but there is always the slight worry that I don't know if the private key really works until I come to sweep the wallet. Of course, by this point it's already got my money in it.
How can I verify that the public address and private key which I have been given do indeed match? Tools at my command include Electrum and a Linux/Python shell. I've heard talk about signing addresses, is this relevant? Or I should run a command to generate the address from the key, and then eyeball it to make sure it matches the one bitaddress gave me? Or I can copy/paste both parts into some other application for verification?

I have some related questions if people don't mind.
1. Is it a problem for the network if I start-up and shutdown my full node every few hours? I tend to just run it when my PC is on in the evenings, if I'm not watching stuff on YouTube or playing games. Is this still useful?
2. I actually run Armory (which as I understand it is a full node). It seems that the number of connected peers is relevant information - where do I find this?

Are there any programs or tools which extend the concept of HD (deterministic) addresses to paper wallets for offline/cold storage? It should work something like bitaddress.org in that you could print off a large number of paper wallets, but you would only have to store a single seed value for backup purposes.
Any thoughts on this idea, or known implementations? I guess it is possible to export the address list from an HD wallet like electrum, but I'm more thinking of nice paper wallets with QR codes and maybe backgrounds.

I think the next 6-12 months are make-or-break for Bitcoin. At the moment it is struggling with the block-size debate, and the number two cryptocurrency is nipping at it's heels. But there is progress being made on increasing capacity and the reward halving is coming later this year (which should already be priced in of course).
Can Bitcoin recover before it collapses under it's own weight and/or the number two coin overtakes it? I don't know, but I've diversified my position to play it safe.
Bitcoin was always a risky investment with a significant chance of failure (despite what people here like to tell you). *Don't invest more than you can afford to lose*.
@_date: 2014-06-14 19:36:24


Ok, but let's say you define five cryptographic hashes to be part of Bitcoin, and every year you pick which three will be used that year. I shouldn't have used the word 'randomly' because the selection process would be entirely deterministic (e.g. based on the last hash found the previous year).
Actually I'm not sure the yearly change it that useful - it just seemed like a natural extension of my existing idea.

@_date: 2017-03-22 22:09:43


Because although the two blockchains are separate, they are also (at least initially) identical. So a transaction which moves coins from address A to address B on one network will do the same on the other network if it is broadcast there.
With a number of BTC/BTU users so passionate about theirs being the 'true' Bitcoin it seems likely that they would take the opportunity to mess with the opponents network.
Even if you only want to stick with BTC and dump your BTU coins, you might find that moving them to an exchange causes your BTC coins to move as well (and the exchange will have different BTC/BTU addresses, so they'll be gone).
Basically it will be a mess unless one side chooses to implement replay protection, which they are both reluctant to do as they both consider themselves the 'real' chain.

It's an online payment system similar to PayPal. But unlike PayPal it is *decentralised*, meaning that no one person or company is in control.

Also, you don't need to disclose to anyone that the demands have been met, but simply claim that the attacker lost interest. So it shouldn't encourage copy-cat attacks (except by the original attacker against different targets, but those are someone else's problem).
Ok, it's not quite that easy... but if the price was right you might be convinced that paying was the sensible option.
Curiously, this was actually my local super until a month ago and I was questioned by the police when they were looking for witnesses. They didn't give any details of the crime though, nor did they mention Bitcoin (seems that came since).

Actions speak louder than words. I think he doesn't really want the Bitcoin, but if he says this then he has to justify why. The real reason is probably that he's lazy/busy/uninterested but people don't like to present themselves in such a light.
So instead he feigns a bit of interest to keep the peace, and then just never gets around to following up on it.

Huh, I guess that makes sense. I was over-complicating it, thanks a lot!
@_date: 2017-04-07 23:26:04
Thanks, it looks like importing into a wallet and then simply making sure it is deleted afterwards is the way forward.

Many countries use the comma as the decimal mark:
* [Countries using Arabic numerals with decimal comma](
Perhaps there is a problem with the locale on your computer, or how your location is being detected?

I think you are better off just reassuring users such as myself, as ultimately my fears are probably unfounded. Releasing a minimal version probably adds building and testing overhead. TREZOR has been exemplary so far, so I'll just trust you if you say the changes don't compromise the existing features.

I'm not sure, but I guess anything which doesn't have ASICs/FPGAs available? Ethereum I think, and probably many other alts as well? Haven't tried it myself.

Don't bother mining. It's will cost your landlord significantly more than you will make, and will make you an enemy in the process. It would literally be better for both of you if he just gave you the money (and we can assume he won't agree to that).
Home mining stopped being practical years ago.

There is a guy who is quite well respected (Dave something) but you have to trust him not to steal your bitcoins once he cracks the password. I *think* that [this is his website]( but I hope someone else can confirm in case I followed a dodgy link. I have never used this service.

As mentioned by other, the first step is probably to create a dump of your RAM. No idea how you do this on a Mac though (and it may be that the memory of secure applications is protected i some way?).
When you have the RAM dump, you can each through each set of 256 adjacent bits to see it it is a private key. Either by checking the checksum (not sure if private keys have one?) or by simply computing the corresponding public address and checking if it matches the one you have. 
This second part (searching) will be technically complex, but I expect somebody here could help if there was a chance of a reward. You would run the risk that they simply keep all the money after you give out the RAM dump though.

To make this more explicit and clear to your users, you could add a note stating that the code is in the *public domain*.

I'm not certain but I don't think so. I think it just performs a fixed number (100,000?) hashes and so the time taken will depend on the machine.

The new ($5) Raspberry Pi.

I think this was actually part of the problem - the US distribution centre was [only 20 miles away from NSA headquaters]( which caused suspicion.

Agreed, both Trezor and Mycelium and upstanding citizens in the Bitcoin space (with a proven track record) but the community will turn on them in an instant. I realize of course that the most vocal members of a community are seldom representative, but it doesn't create a positive image or welcoming ecosystem.

The last checkbox reads 'Overige bezittingen, zoals', and the third bullet point then reads 'virtuele betaalmiddelen (bijvoorbeeld bitcoins)'. But yes, a marker would have helped here.

Not much (besides DAO tokens at the moment). But Ether is not intended to be used as a currency, it's more of a 'fuel' for the Ethereum ecosystem.
If you want an online currency you can actually use then Bitcoin is currently your best bet. But if your hoping to get rich overnight then Ethereum is currently looking quite promising.

Perhaps, but the devs don't *have* to work on Bitcoin. They work on what is interesting to them and where they feel valued. If something else takes over they could switch fairly easily. I'm sure other cryptocurrencies would welcome devs joining them from Bitcoin.

So instead of a complex conspiracy in which NSA agents collude with governments around the world to intercept and modify Entropy devices (and then don't just put them back in fresh packaging for some reason...), it turns out that the much simpler explanation of the stickers  simply falling off is actually the correct one.
In addition, the reason that packages which were routed within 20 miles of the NSA headquarters was simply because [that's where the US distributor lives](
Let's try to keep this in mind next time we have a trademark uproar.

I think it was probably Satoshi, concerned about the fallout that Dorian might endure. However, it is still possible that Dorian *is* Satoshi, because in this case it is easy for him to log in and post the denial himself. So actually the denial doesn't prove anything, and you'd think Satoshi would have realised that.
@_date: 2015-11-28 21:12:46
Is there any evidence that is really Satoshi? It's not his usual email address and it's not signed. I thought the consensus was that someone was simply trying to twist the debate.

No, I can't say I really thought/worried about that. There is no personal information, so all somebody would know is that a given Bitcoin address and a given ByteBall address were owned by the same person (whoever that may be). I'm sure exchanges could potentially collect/deduce a lot more information than this.
