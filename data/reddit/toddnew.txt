It's a great question and one that I'm curious about as well. Miners won't mine (or shouldn't mine) at a loss.
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:12:35
It's a bit more nuanced than that. Where capital losses really come in handy is from the carry forward. 
Let's say someone lost $10,000 at Mt. Gox and had no other BTC sales for the year
2014 (-$3,000 capital loss allowed / -$7,000 carry forward)
2015 person makes a few transactions resulting in $15,000 of profit: ($15,000 - $7,000 = only $8,000 taxable)
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:44:20
No one in their right mind should invest all of their capital into any investment. I like to call it "oh shit" money. And it always stays liquid. Keeps me from having to realize losses.

Interesting. Also the banishment of recent Mt. Gox data is very interesting.
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:22:27
No, the $3,000 max only applies when you have no other gains to offset

Here's the ETF for the NASDAQ "QQQ".
Even if you were the one person who bought at the highest tick (worst time) in 2007 ($52.37) you'd have a gain of 71.92%*

Nope, I'm just looking at one of your largest exchanges evaporating. No way that's bad for BTC.
@_date: 2014-02-20 23:03:27
No matter how well you did it all ends badly
@_date: 2014-02-21 01:14:33
So 100% loss. Can someone check my math on that?

I'm glad I could help. I don't pick bottoms because there can only be 1 low tick.
If one had to take a stab at buying I'd look at the 50 day moving average on a daily chart and if BTC closes above the line on much higher volume (&lt;--- volume is key). Then buy a 50% position with a tight stop below the 50 in case it's a fake out.
@_date: 2013-04-16 21:15:40
Volume confirms moves higher or lower.

Bigger picture thought: anyone else find it troubling that no one really knows what the definitive tax laws are?
Best way to get the government's wrath is having a large group of people claim their taxes erroneously or not at all. It makes them want to regulate things.

Chart patterns are a graphical look into the emotions of fear and greed. Whether it be tulip mania, stocks in the 1920's, or the Dotcom bubble the chart is the same.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:40:39
Have an upvote, shorted 1,000 BTC at 112.34.
Just kidding, too much lag.
Seriously some of those sites look pretty shady, I'm gonna stick with the quasi-government regulated stuff and let you guys handle the BTC.

Volume has been really low...
Volume has been 200% ABOVE average. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:37:45
Yes I do apologize for that, my title was mostly for the haters. 
As for the future of BTC I can't accurately speak to that. I can say that the exchanges you trade on are a joke and there's too much general confusion. 
To be taken seriously you would need governmental oversight as the NYSE, NASDAQ, and CBOT have. Serious capital won't flow to a confusing process and it won't flow to places where there's a mindset that the parents have gone out of town and the kids are throwing a house party.
This is exactly what BTC looks like to us outsiders. And if I'm mistaken then there are many out there who are mistaken. It's the BTC community's fault they didn't explain it well, not ours for not "getting it".
Finally not running into these posts would help.
"Help I'm missing BTC" (that's not confidence inspiring). 
"Mt. Gox screwed us." (No they didn't). Gox didn't make the price fall single handily, fear made that happen. This was represented by that boom/bust chart.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:44:32
You would be doing it right

More like publicly judging. I'm happy with life, that's true wealth.

There's a meme here somewhere.
BTC down 71% from peak...definitely a bear market now.

Sad because it's been 30+ years and those who bought at the top are only 1/3rd of the way back to being whole.

I've noticed when the price is rising then lag drops significantly. But when the price is falling then Mt. Gox throws on the brakes. Wonder why that is?
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:24:55
I wouldn't say total collapse, there's always some level of value retained. Let's just say I wouldn't want to be putting in buy orders if it falls to 101. Sit on your hands, you're likely to get a much better price down the road.

US treasuries, not the same swoosh downwards and over a short period of time. The monetary outflows could be eye popping. TL;DR refi or get a home loan sooner than later.

I was watching that, idiots were buying $2 above what was offered in the hopes of getting others to join them. It briefly worked.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:39:55
It's the NASDAQ
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:20:58
The speed of the boom/bust of BTC fascinates me most of all. As for why it's so fast I'd imagine a majority of BTC owners are also early tech adopters as am I. We tend to jump on board new things quickly en masse.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:54:25
LOL...see why it's not wise to never say never.
@_date: 2013-04-16 21:17:13
It must CLOSE above the 50 DMA on higher up volume.

Sorry, I couldn't help myself. To be clear I have no idea of where BTC is going to be 1,2,10 years from now. My post is meant to be informational.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:07:55
No doubt that played a role but last night I was watching the bid/asks on  stream by. Sellers outnumbered buyers by 3 to 1 on average. The buyers were "painting the tape" meaning many of them were purchasing just 0.01 BTC per trade significantly above the ask which helps prop up the price. Each time they were outmatched by sellers trading significantly more than 0.01 BTC, I'd say 10-30 BTC on average. If we were talking total dollar value, it seemed like it was $1 buying to every $100 selling.
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:48:38
If that were really true BTC would not be down 70% in less than a week.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:54:39
I started with 25k and paid all my bills from it.  And of course had losses along the way, always trying to learn how to best assuage them rather than prevent them from occurring simply because no one is perfect at it. I love the baseball analogy with trading, all you really need is hit .350 if you have proper risk rules in place.
@_date: 2013-04-14 15:32:40
There is NO such theory in technical analysis. Don't believe me, just google it.

Yes, but that chart is based on fiat so obviously it doesn't apply here.

The ability to short is an essential component in any liquid market. It would add credibility.
@_date: 2013-04-16 23:29:13
It's all about fear, late entry investors cashing out probably never to return. It can only be called capitulation if the price rises appreciably immediately after. This ain't capitulation.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:25:46
No, I think pensions, nervous retail, the rise of ETF's, and most importantly the Fed buying all the paper they can possibly buy has created a bubble. It won't pop it will deflate eventually as everything does.

If Zuck did this it would be his first success in quite some time
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:00:37
Good eye, I didn't bother to adjust the MA's for timeframe. For trading the max timeframe I use is the 1 year which is for getting a grasp on the big picture. I have the most success trading off a 30 day chart I find.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:17:44
Extremely well said

I should note. I own no Bitcoin or have any opinion one way or the other on them. Traders who use technical analysis only trade what's staring them in the face. My post is for informational purposes only. I wish everyone only the best with this.
EDIT: I find Fibonacci retracements useful
BTC 1 month fib's
61.8% Fib = 178.39
50.0% Fib = 151.32
38.2% Fib = 124.26
Also Pivot Points (these prices dif for BTC pivots just blew my mind)
R2: 186.76
R1: 147.77

You Australians struggle to buy a lot of things. r/lego usually has a post on how much higher in price they are down there.
And you hit on my original intent perfectly. Fear and greed are ubiquitous.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:07:54
Exactly, you get it. TA is used to maximize profit. 
Buying at 5 selling at 20. (5,000 into 20,000)
Buying at 5 again, selling at 200. (20,000 into 800,000)
Buying at ???
Sure you could have bought and held 1,000 BTC @ 5 and they'd be worth $80,000 grand right now.
I like doing things my way.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:49:58
So in other words playing out like that chart I posted.
Mid 20's a decent buy point if BTC is your thing.

2 rules I live by as an equities trader.

@_date: 2013-04-12 04:38:07
The analysis doesn't change in regards to whether it's a currency, bond market, or equities. All of them have a current price that fluctuates up or down creating a chart where TA is very useful.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:43:39
Point taken. But the NASDAQ is still (-40.6%) away from that bubble high 13 years ago.
