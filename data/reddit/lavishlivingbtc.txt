True but hardware wallet itself is closed source reason I’m making my own hardware wallet which is also not plugged in if you read what I wrote only using to make transactions and never on browsers or such don’t wanna be a dick but I don’t trust closed source who knows what happens later in life if the price sky rockets ��‍♂️

What u think keep the ledger or return it and get a cold card
@_date: 2019-11-03 02:40:19
I didn’t buy the card yet I just want to keep one I don’t even have more then 2k ever I have $900
@_date: 2019-11-02 16:35:16
Hahahah I’m crying I mean most I got is like 2k not much to what people have
@_date: 2019-11-15 13:55:43
Yeah thanks man decided to go with electrum only part I’m stuck with deciding to use Tor networks or don’t use it also I don’t even have the minimum to even mix haha $1k I think
@_date: 2019-11-03 01:43:30
Your totally right but my friend pointed out that ledger device isn’t open source reason I’m getting nervous for no reason
@_date: 2019-11-15 12:19:36
Thanks boss already going with electrum
@_date: 2019-11-02 18:14:15
Dam I guess I’ll have to return the ledger and get a cold car how do I do the dice and words things is there a good YouTube video ?
@_date: 2019-11-02 00:59:42
As a bootable Linux OS and only have wasabi wallet on there to make transaction and when I’m done I unplug it and sit somewhere secure
@_date: 2019-11-02 00:10:15
Quick question should I encrypt the usb before or after I install the OS also one more thing when everything setup should I go to the website to download the wallet or download it move it to another usb and open it from there thanks
@_date: 2019-11-04 09:11:51
Nice blue tooth ahhh idk let’s just say trust issues lol but I’ll study and see maybe I’ll either buy one or create my own which is encrypted and never used on the internet
@_date: 2019-11-02 18:09:14
Should I return the ledger nano a and get a cold card ?
@_date: 2019-11-04 09:04:14
1) I don’t need a hardware wallet not really a investor 
2) sorry I’m not understanding I was curious is it worth it still with wasabi wallet without coinjoin
And yes I will update electrum 
But still need to find out what’s the winner electrum or Wasabi
@_date: 2019-11-03 02:41:13
I was actually thinking to get back $60 and save it on a bootable OS that’s clean and have 1 desktop wallet and store it there would still be considered hardware wallet ��
@_date: 2019-11-02 00:22:53
Thing is ledger isn’t open source only the app is
@_date: 2019-11-02 18:09:57
Idk how u would make transaction if it’s plugged to a power bank sounds interesting might return the ledger
@_date: 2019-11-15 12:17:14
Thank you I’m going with Electrum now I’m just debating running Tor network while using it or don’t
@_date: 2019-11-02 02:27:41
How hard is it to install wasabi on to it or is electrum better ? And thanks boss
@_date: 2019-11-02 02:42:41
Thanks I’ll check it out tonight also should I encrypt it with veracrypt first before I install the OS or after I set everything up and tails is running
P.S. is there a way to check if it’s encrypted.
@_date: 2019-11-02 02:24:02
I would use tails but it will reset every time I use it so yeah
@_date: 2019-11-15 12:20:24
Might also make my own Hardware wallet with tails on a usb encryption that is never online unless to send money but that’s down the line
@_date: 2019-11-03 00:46:00
Pay in*
@_date: 2019-11-03 05:48:22
This is different how safe is using bitrefill ?
@_date: 2019-11-02 02:33:28
Thanks man as I said I got a MacBook first I have to figure out to boot of a USB heard it’s hard with Linux will give it a try in a few hours ����
@_date: 2019-11-02 18:45:56
@_date: 2019-11-03 00:33:03
Look what I replied to other user
@_date: 2019-11-02 01:10:45
What u think is the safer OS Mac or Linux mint or manjaro
@_date: 2019-11-02 00:08:41
I have a ledger nano S currently idk if I really want it since it’s kinda of the pain in the ass to get everything setup and ready to go ��‍♂️ tbh I never have more then 2k on my wallet
@_date: 2019-11-02 00:58:52
I mean let’s keep it real all these devices are DIY at the end of the day nothing special except you validating it yourself why trust 3rd regardless when you can do it yourself I’ll see what I can do maybe make my own
@_date: 2019-11-17 16:19:04
Comment to see later thanks
@_date: 2019-11-02 15:45:02
How is that how do I securely generate keys
@_date: 2019-11-01 22:45:06
I like how wasabi wallet works I’ll pass on third party hardware wallet
@_date: 2019-11-01 22:51:30
$9k sky rocketed ��‍♂️must have low expectations on bitcoin
@_date: 2019-11-15 12:21:10
My own node and electrumX I’m new to this I have no clue what my own node or how to use it maybe I’ll do some research thanks
@_date: 2019-11-03 00:45:43
Thinking about that but I still have to make a amazon account and pay fees and taxes reason I was trying to pu crypto to save money
@_date: 2019-11-02 00:55:47
Reason I don’t feel comfortable is that ledger device is closed sourced
@_date: 2019-11-02 02:45:41
Okay thanks I’ll check it out ����
@_date: 2019-11-02 16:56:20
I’ll have to check that out is it open source ?
@_date: 2019-11-01 22:52:57
I get it but this is just the beginning I see it 50-100k a coin others see more
@_date: 2019-11-18 08:25:19
Good point but I’m a lazy guy ����
@_date: 2019-11-04 09:08:56
Debating first I saw ledger nano S was open source later found out the device isn’t open source the ledger live app is and it makes me think about what’s these companies end game and who knows what happens I have trust issues I guess
@_date: 2019-11-02 15:43:58
So don’t use a ledger
@_date: 2019-11-03 00:32:50
Used that yesterday very sketch order cancelled 3 times I just withdrew the money back to wallet
@_date: 2019-11-01 23:16:18
I might just use Mint have you heard good things about it
@_date: 2019-11-02 18:11:49
True I was thinking maybe in the long run who knows maybe the company might cash out who really knows the programmed device
@_date: 2019-11-03 06:03:32
So super legit thanks I might start doing that purse.io is kinda fishy to me every order was either got 2 packages of the same item like today or cancelled or had to re order so yeah idk if it’s still work staying with them or go with bitrefill
@_date: 2019-11-15 12:22:12
Understand but I never have 10k plus if anything i would be playing with 1-5k later in life
@_date: 2019-11-01 23:54:39
Use purse.io that’s what I use
@_date: 2019-11-03 04:23:12
Your perfect quick question if you could only have one and secure it which one would it be thanks.
@_date: 2019-11-02 01:16:07
Okay when you say make sure to very and is a trusted source how do I go about that and is it good out the box do I need to update or install things to secure it thanks
@_date: 2019-11-01 22:54:59
Guess we just think different which is fine but the technology is amazing and stores like Starbucks are picking it up so will see soon cash will be extinct
@_date: 2019-11-15 12:15:41
Thanks quick question on Electrum guessing I can use Segwit and my receive address changes every time if not how do I do it? 
Also what is the point of running Tor for electrum as some people do curious thanks homie
@_date: 2019-11-03 17:56:24
Was just about to use moon to lol
@_date: 2019-11-02 01:09:59
Yup exactly
@_date: 2019-11-02 01:34:18
Will do thanks boss
@_date: 2019-11-04 09:10:32
@_date: 2019-11-15 12:10:15
No ������ everyone saying wasabi but other say electrum I just need a good reason to use one or the other 
Also should I run Electrum using Tor networks ?
@_date: 2019-10-29 07:54:50
Have bitcoin on a hardware wallet need to withdraw it and get cash
@_date: 2019-10-29 08:00:47
Don’t want to put my ID etc
@_date: 2019-12-28 14:04:19
No way really ����
@_date: 2019-12-28 13:58:24
I have never seen that type of gold why that choice ?
