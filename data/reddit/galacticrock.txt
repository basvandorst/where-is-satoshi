Hurricane, volcano eruption, tsunami. Pick one. Entire cities to rumble, poor populations get even poorer. Tele-com steps in, offers help: phones for everyone. On a contract, of course. Soon the poor can’t live without the phone. Soon many fail to pay. Soon they’re being coerced to pay any way they can. Soon they lose whatever little they have.
This is how blockchain will help the poor.

Futures close this month (can’t remember the date). Contracts were settling around $9.300, thus if the scale tends more toward the short side, whales will sell as much as possible and cash in whatever difference between $9.300 and the bottom. But I’m no expert anyway...
Edit: found it. 
First contracts close on the 16th this month. We might be going on a downward spiral until then. And then new contracts closing on the 13th of June.

No way. Below $4000 there’s no point in mining anymore. There will be a spring-like action around those levels rejecting the price up. I don’t even think it’ll fall below 5k TBH.

Will buyers go long or short on those contracts? I’d say with a value this close to today’s bitcoin price investors will go long as the difference in the future price is more likely to be greater on the upside. What is your take?
@_date: 2018-04-28 22:12:02
It’s called Reflexivity. A self reinforcing sentiment in the market. Fundamentals affect price which in turn affects sentiment. Fundamentals end up being affected by the reinforced sentiment. I believe George Soros wrote that book.

16th of May. But there are contracts going a bit higher (9400) closing on the 13th of June as well.
@_date: 2018-04-28 22:02:54
Some will do what I’m describing, and some will do the exact opposite. But remember last time contracts closed? Bitcoin price went down.
The point of this post is: will futures suppress bitcoin’s price preventing it from ever reaching stratospheric heights? Some whale recently said they would “tame bitcoin”. As I see it, you do that through futures. Whales still make incredible amounts of money while the small fish sees little to no gains. 
That’s the point of this post, to spark such discussion.
@_date: 2018-04-18 22:50:00
I never watched an episode. What is it really about?
@_date: 2018-04-28 15:12:08
If so, this is what going long means: whales will buy as much as possible from now to the day the contract closes making the price go up far beyond the ~9000. If bitcoin hits 14.000, for instance, they take 5000 gains. Immediately after the contract closes they sell all the bitcoin they bought from today to that date.
Basically they’ll take profits twice by driving the price up themselves for something they’ll sell in the future.
If I’m seeing things correctly we’ll be up for a massive crash as soon as those contracts close.

“Tecnically possible” :) Let’s put it like this: would you if you could?
@_date: 2018-04-28 10:37:19
Let’s say a bunch of whales go short on a contract for a specific date. They buy from now up to that date which will push the price up, and then sell just before the contract is due, thus crashing the price. They make money selling at the top and they make money by getting the contract’s gains. The lower it goes below the contract’s value the better.
Futures pretty much ruin the bitcoin market. Chances of it ‘mooning’ are now very slim.

@_date: 2018-04-28 22:17:09
You bet that the price goes up and you force the price up yourself by buying in bulk. Sell once the contract closes and take profits twice. 
Question is: how far will they push it beyond the 9000 mark?
