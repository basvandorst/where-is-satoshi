Exactly, but neither is USD.  It is all dependant on the company that is paying the interest.  What are they using the money for?  How do the earn their fees to pay interest? This is where the majority of the risk is.

After they get over the attack, even if all the BTC was stolen, we could still be paid from future payouts of real hardware.  We would only lose a few payouts.  If it was a ponzi scheme then there would be nothing left to payout and no hardware to mine, so total loss.

 but it is US based and you have to have an account for more than 30 days.  They use cards as a backup funding source.
@_date: 2014-12-29 14:24:55
Its too early to tell exactly what happened and if it is a ponzi or a hack.  We have to wait and see how this all plays out.

I did a post on the hack and some of the clues of the game.
@_date: 2014-12-29 14:25:13
Nothing yet, just minor updates with the game.

I am holding out and purchasing bitcoin at this reduced price with my fiat.  We will see what happens down the road.
@_date: 2014-12-29 11:23:11
I hope it comes back as well, but we will see what happens
@_date: 2014-12-29 14:23:38
We will definitely see after this is all over, who has hardware and who doesn't.
I added a few other operational sites as well and some updates

Check out BTCJam for Peer2Peer lending.  You can get some good interest, but there is a risk involved.

Different kinds of Attack on LTCgear
The new ASIC is delayed until February
“A percent of users” have been payed and will gradually pay ‘legit users’
Account Tax value will be added

Chris is slowly making updates: the site is back online, the server upgraded and moved to new hosting.    It is weird to do all that, if it wasn't a hack and just a ponzi.  If it was a ponzi all along, just run with it, not improve it.  
However, only time will tell if it comes back.

I think this and all the hacks is a wake up call that cloud mining services need to do better.  I think there is a market for cloud mining, but it is the wild wild west and is ripe for fraud as well as poor management.  CEX.IO is/was the leader in a reputable cloud service.
@_date: 2015-01-01 23:42:07
It could be part of the trust building, if the ponzi is going to continue.  However, I don't think the money will flow as freely back in after this hack for a while.
Who knows, it just sucks that we are in this state of cloud minig where there is so many scams and poorly managed companies that end up being scams.

TLDR LTCgear Recap:
Farm Payments page has been updated for Jan 2, 2015
Weekly Payments are moved to a balance per user
Pay on demand will be live Monday Jan 5, 2015
Last payment I received is Dec 19, 2014
Some people are missing 4 weeks of payments now
Still no update on the multiplication that was supposed to happen on the 24th.

I designed a 18 page guide to help people secure their accounts and reduce their risk.  Hopefully people will secure their accounts and not be greedy and take a little off the table, in case Scrypt.CC turns into another LTCGear.

I used to invest a lot, then I started to lose a lot when a number of the cloud mining sites folded.  But I have come back and invested some more.  I would say I'm almost back to my previous levels.

They say they are expanding to more, but not sure when yet.  I hope it is quick!

The problem is we never recoup any of the costs of the obsolete mining equipment.  A number of providers use contracts and when fees exceed mining revenue for x days the contract is canceled.  But many companies like GAW supposedly had equipment, GAW even sold used miners and we never recouped that cost.  There was one fund on Havelock that I believe actually sold the hardware and paid a special dividend.  Thats 1 good cloud mining project for how ever many have failed so far.

I wish you the best of luck!  I continually invest, however there are some scammers out there.  BTCJam is doing what it can to get rid of them, but be careful.  Let me know if you need help investing.

Havelock has changed their deposit addresses on March 8, 2015.  It is not sure why at this time or if it was related to the recent downtime.  If you have any automated deposits be sure to check that you have updated the Bitcoin deposit address.  If you have any pre-filled, remembered or saved addresses make sure to clear them and update them with your new address.  Check your Bitcoin deposit address here

UPDATE: Lockdown extended by 36 hours as expected, Chris never met a deadline he couldn't extend.  Also he is now warning that users who use a script/proxy/VPN/TOR will get their account hardlocked. Not exactly sure but it seems like a manual process and even longer lockdown time.

So far they have been the most reliable company out there.

not all cloud mining services are scams.  There have been a few recently that have caused a bad rap, but there are others that are still going strong and are reputable companies.

Unavailable from 9 - 28 Feb,
Probably going to be backlogged in March,
Effects both AMHash Platform and Havelock

I know, I'm jealous!  I just hope they come back and make payouts.
