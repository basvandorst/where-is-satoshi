Thanks!  For some reason my transfers to add cash are failing.  But once I figure that out, I know what to do.  Thanks again!
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:39:53
Nice!  Thanks for sharing.

Okay.  This may sound like an ignorant question, but how do I upload cash from my bank to the cash app and then purchase?
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:21:23
The the Square Cash Account the same as the Cash Card?  How do you actually trade with Bitcoin using the account?
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:33:31
Okay, so you do need the Cash App card enabled.  Then once you add money, it will be there instantly.
Once I add the cash, where do I find the Buy Now (Bitcoin) option?  I'm guessing it's not yet enabled for me, but where would you find it?

Coinbase closes my accounts for no reason.  I also can't wait to get approved and move on to a better exchange.

So it's better to have a hardware wallet because they are easier to use and you get a recovery seed?  Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:30:52
I think this is great!

What website is this?
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:51:01
I think the Lightning Network is one avenue toward a trustless time-locked transaction multi-way contract solution.

I got it now, Thanks!!
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:59:39
Thanks, I understand the difference now.  If you want to use coins (spend, trade), it's better to have a software/hardware wallet.  If you want to cold store your coins, it's better to have a paper wallet.

That's what happened to me, and then they closed my account when I tried to sign up for GDAX.

People still have DVD players?  haha

Buy high, HODL until price drops, then sell, sell, sell!
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:40:27
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:01:31
Oh, you can move and trade coin between different wallets on the same hardware device?  That's nice.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:16:40
What is better, paper wallets or hardware wallets?

Just out of curiosity, how did you guys obtain the raw/real-time data to make the graphs?  Is it pretty simple to do so? 
@_date: 2011-06-18 06:56:23
Or some way to integrate all services into one (e.g. MtGox, tradehill, etc.); in this way, you'd effectively have something very smooth and professional, which would ultimately benefit the market, the trade services, and the individual consumers.

Do you know this just by looking at the candlesticks? Or do you look at the depth. I'm having trouble reading the depth charts. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
@_date: 2011-06-08 08:42:18
I think this would be good to know, too. Got my upvote.

Are the dates on the x-axes correct? At least according to MTGox, in May, bitcoin was not at $17. Perhaps this is supposed to be a 24-hour graph?
Some suggestions:
1) Make the graphs interactive so that I can specify the length of time. For example, I want to look at trends in the last 5 minutes, in the last 5 months, last 5 years...etc. I want to be able to specify these times.
2) Add calculations of variability. For example, during a five-minute time interval, what is the range of scores? How does the variability change over time? Maybe you could plot this variability in a graph as well?
3) Use equations to predict where the next trend is based on the current average and variability measures (linear or quadratic trend analysis).
Thanks!

Hmmm...well maybe we could at least see another graph, one with variability plotted over time. This would only be one graph.
Yeah, bitcoin is unpredictable, but you could use linear or quadratic [regression]( to predict an outcome. Thus, the equation would make the best possible guess.

Will be back Monday. I want to know this algorithm!
