Keep in mind some people are on slow connections, maybe in congested cities, maybe in the middle of nowhere.  Anyway, if your querying multiple servers that need to be recieved before the UI loads that 2.5 seconds may be 30 or 60s for someone that barely has a connection.  You need to put those numbers up as they come in or do as the other user suggested and only have a 1 or 2 on the main load screen.

Parties make bitcoin transactions between each other using a "channel" which don't need to be published to the blockchain and the receiving party can verify btc as genuine and authorize a transaction within seconds.  When your done transacting with the party (you might have hundreds of transactions over years before) you close the channel and THEN it is recorded to the blockchain.
Very simplified explaination.

I would look at insiders who may have had access to the seed or priv xPub. (Did any 'friends' try to help you with this problem?)  They possibly sent it to an exchange or wallet service and thats why its in with another 14k btc.  Or malware
Edit: I might regret saying this sometime, but bc.i has been totally trustworthy and a beacon of the bitcoin community nearly since its inception.  Also, all seeds and keys are held client side meaning they have no access to them without your identifier and password (which they only keep a hash of)

I call bs on this being anymore complicated then just using NFC alone.  The customer gets the payment request via NFC from the merchant.  The customer sends the signed transaction back to the merchant via NFC and the merchant broadcasts it.   Vola done.  NFC has a data transfer rate of 424 kb per second.  It makes no sense to use Bluetooth and just complicate the whole thing more.  A signed transaction is less then a few kB

I think people are looking at this the wrong way.  The supreme court has ruled that money and speech are one in the same.  I would argue that when banks close customer accounts because they have differing political views is the same as silencing speech therefore violating your first amendment rights to freedom of speech.  And before someone says: "they are private and can pick whoever they want to do business with'. I say bullshit!  The taxpayers saved these worthless "private" banks.  They also have all sorts of requirements they have to meet to be state sanctioned.   How about one of those hoops be not violating peoples first amendment rights?  Oh, I forgot.

I think that FLOPS is frequently the standard nomenclature when describing "operations per second" that a given resource can perform.  There shouldn't be much of a difference between the time required to do math for integers instead of floating point.  I'm pretty sure that integer operations would actually be faster.
Not very many hardware platforms exclusively compute integers either.  Bitcoin ASICs are unique in this manner, but it is still a fair comparison for math "operations per second"

Willy has nothing to do with that.

Actually I just tried the (literally called) "bitcoin lightning wallet" on android and it supports channel backups (it costs a few sats per backup). Not sure how new the feature is but it also supports watchtowers. Far as I can tell this app is amaze. It's also the most downloaded LN wallet...

I understand what your saying about being able to restore channel states totally from a seed and if that's possible, that would be great. But the app I mentioned uses cloud storage and an 'Olympus' server along with watchtowers to catch cheats.
My point was lightning works great, today, even if you drop your phone in the toilet you aren't risking funds. (I understand the whole project is under construction so obviously there \*are\* risks, but this app has seemed to mitigate all the main factors I've seen levied against using LN)

hardware based 2fa uses a "secret" that you should have written down or taken a screenshot of and printed so that when you re-loaded your phone you could re-load your authenticator.

(OP: disregard this comment, it doesn't really apply to you.) 
When you say, "delete device and restore", your just saying as an exercise in learning how to use trezor, right?  Seems like a bad idea to type the secure seed that only exists in the "secure device" into an internet connected device, right?  Not exactly "cold storage" at that point.  
I guess last time I used the trezor they made you re-enter your seed to confirm you have written it down correctly.  How exactly is this "cold storage" when any keylogger could grab the seed?  I guess that's why I don't rely on my trezor for anything more then novelty.  
If anyone can explain where I'm wrong in my reasoning please let me know (I haven't used my Trezor in like a year or so, they may have changed it since then...)
edit: so I just tried setting up a new trezor and it does infact keep all the seed words on the device, so that's pretty cool.  Just make sure to restore it from an offline computer should the need arise

For perspective in the last 2 weeks my node with \~30 channels &amp; \~.8 overall capacity has routed 52 transactions, but I've set my fees as low as possible and I've only earned around 30 Satoshis. My fees are about 1000x lower than most other nodes.  Once LN starts getting more traffic I'll definitely up my fees but currently I'm just interested in seeing how many transactions route via my node.

Never say impossible. If everyone in Venezuela bought an **average** of .015625 bitcoin (\~$56.14 per person) the whole country would have around a million bitcoins.  With all the lost coins there will only ever be less than 18 mil bitcoin in existence.  I know $56 is a big amount for many of the poor there (and what the buy pressure would do with the price) but if they only got paid with it (because it bought food today and even more tomorrow) they may be able to save a few satoshis.
Until recently it wasn't practical for a lot of poor Venezuelans to use bitcoin simply due to the transaction fees, but with the recent adoption of the lightning network that could all change quick
**edit:**  I totally read your message wrong and thought you said it was impossible for them... lol.. I'll leave my comment anyway

First off, a VPS can be had for \~$5 a month and isn't necessary if you have a computer at home you can run it on. Secondly there is no choosing the "no-fee option" (why would anyone pay if there was a "no fee option"?).  LN automatically routes your payments via the **lowest fee** nodes and there is always a fee (albeit possibly a very small fee depending on the routing nodes config).

You'd have a tough time because Bitcoin addresses now change with every transaction.  While the feature has been available since 2011, it didn't get widely implemented with most people until 2013-2014. So you want to work directly with data from the blockchain you best bet would be to good at older transactions as people routinely used a single address as their main "wallet".  These days "wallets" are a collection of addresses, that change with every transaction.
There are blockchain research companies that make big bucks trying to figure out exactly what you would like to know. I would check out a free report one of them released called "the elliptic report" you can download [here]( for free.  I haven't had a chance to read it yet, but I've seen it cited many times.
Good Luck!

Well, doing a quick search it looks like Argentina's inflation rate is almost 50% right now while Paraguay only has about a \~3% inflation rate, so if I were the Argentine I would be foolish not to keep the Bitcoin, but the Paraguay guy faces less risk in his local currency so he may choose to convert to local fiat.
I wouldn't be surprised if Paraguay didn't want Argentinas money for this exact reason, so they asked for hard money instead. Between Venezuela and other nearby countries inflation rates, the "big" bitcoin revolution might start in South America.

I'm not sure exactly what your questions is. When sending a payment the routing is calculated automatically by lnd but you can specify your own route (or path) (not sure why you'd want to, other than testing)
The only routing I can affect is by whom I connect and the rates I set. (currently I charge the lowest possible so a "base rate" of .0001 satoshi and a "proportional fee rate" of .000001
Looking at data from forwarded HTLCs the biggest transaction I handled was 4,000,000 satoshis and I made a 4.001 satoshi fee

The 1w limitation is for the output power of the transmitter. The router would most likely be using a omni-directional antenna providing little gain above the 1w.  On the client end one can legally put out up to 4 watts EIRP using a direction antenna (yagi or dish) which would allow the client to achieve well over 2 miles (even over fairly challenging terrain). I've seen legal 900 Mhz ISM links as far as 11 miles (line-of-sight, using towers, etc.)


The FCC enforcement division is a joke and they're certainly not wasting their time chasing down people chomping up the 900mhz ISM band.

You can set your "base fee" to zero, but the proportional fee (charged on every satoshi forwarded) can only be set to .000001 as the lowest possible value.  Granted these are small amounts, but there is **always** a fee.
For example with my fees set as low as possible I made 4.001 satoshi for forwarding 4,000,000 sat.,

That isn't 100% true.  Back in the 80s there were a few soda and fast-food companies  that used their competitors name in their ads to disparage them but marketing companies found out that they were actually paying for free advertising for competition and quit that practice.
Now saying things that are explicity "not true" could open a company up to a slander or liable lawsuit but they were just saying things like "we use 100% beef unlike burger king" or the such...

Its the way you send money in the bitcoin world.  Instead of having a credit card number you give to a merchant, the merchant provides you with a "bitcoin address" for you to pay them with.  So you see, bitcoin is a "push" technology (you "push" the money to the recipient's address).  Whereas with a credit card, the merchant "pulls" the money from your account based on the account number you give him.

Apparently one of the first transactions over the internet was for a bag of weed back in the '70s.  Was it an advertisement when the guy emailed, "Hey man!  I got some sensimilla!!"
There was much talk in the early days of the internet about how it was going to sustain itself because everything was free.  Advertising did not become ubiquitous until goto.com start their paid search program.  read about it here:

while I agree with open source software in principle, the problems with it is "open sores" software can allow an attacker a big advantage.  Let's face it, how often is code audited?  The government (or other actors) can pay people to sit around and look for exploit vectors in open source software while the same is not true of closed source software.  Look at heartbleed, a bug just sitting there for anyone to see.  You can bet there are many other heartbleed level of exploits because of open source software.

And get away from your computer for a day and meet some people with similar interests as you.  $200 isn't much compared to what insidebitcoins charge for their conferences.

I always thought this was the best thing about bitcoin (the limited supply vs inflation of the usd).  But keep in mind, bitcoin inflation has just only lowered and if you believe the official inflation statistics of the us government, bitcoin actually has more inflation even after the havening.  Some day what you say will be true (might even be now if the government statics aren't to be believed-- which they probably shouldn't)

It's not mining. It just needs to verify a block every 10 minutes. It shouldn't use that much battery
@_date: 2016-07-14 07:33:48
Yes, it's that good

I had heard people say this before. I even think i recall trying to install it myself, only to find the same thing with the crazy permissions.  
So I just checked and the only permissions requested was the camera (presumably to scan qr codes)

Wow. So you can trade counterparty for counterparty? Useful...
@_date: 2016-07-18 06:39:55
That feature hasn't worked in several months.  I'm surprised no one here has mentioned that

Yes, this is bitcoins strong suit.  Buy now while it's still cheap
@_date: 2016-07-07 05:34:49
If you were a wale waiting to buy, would you do that all at once making the price go through the roof or over a few months or years to get the best possible price?

It hit 1200 for a short time (a day or two) then it went back down to 150 and stayed between 200-350 for the next several years)
