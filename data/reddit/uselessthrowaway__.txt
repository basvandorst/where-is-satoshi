I agree it's confusing, it's pretty dense. I've had to reread sections quite a few times.

Doesn't it say 0 confirmations?

Sorry I was wrong, you need to wait for it to clear mempool and then resend.
Make sure you stop your client from rebroadcasting it. You're gonna be waiting a while though. It should clear before it's dropped from mempool, unless this attack gets twice as large.

I'm going to double reply to you, in the other phases it seems to me like even if 2/3 isn't reached you get your money back. Only in the final transaction phase if you don't have 1/3 honest then everyones' money disappears. Is this correct in your reading as well?
If that is true then it seems you could just force inputs to be mixing peers, so that attackers would lose their own money, and then make the denomination small (maybe use .01 or .1) to prevent heavy losses.

You'll just have to wait a long time.
A very long time.

You have the percentages backwards.

It's also a federated peg. It's named Alpha for a reason. The technology is "somewhat there."

Ross kept his wallet unencrypted on an encrypted drive. The agents seized his computer with the drive unencrypted.

That's not how it works. Everyone uses the same denomination of output if I'm reading it right. So we all want to mix with .1 BTC. I can send &gt;= .1 BTC for mixing, and the change will go to a fresh change address. I then get .1 BTC out of the mix that is indistinguishable from all the other .1 BTC, because the change is all generated in the final transaction. I can then roll that .1 BTC into another couple mixes. They recommend 3 hours in the paper for near complete anonymity. 
The first paragraph on page 7 elaborates on this.

Can you answer a question for me, it seems sometimes they described there being multiple Ti's, and sometimes they use language that indicates it's only one, do they do both? Do they have larger transactions and one to one transactions both occurring randomly? The wording at that section indicates it but in the protocol description its not immediately clear to me.
nvm, it's just weirdly worded. It looks like it's always 1 to 1 with the same input denomination v.
