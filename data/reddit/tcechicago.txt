If I was to pose the same question about the automobile and printing press 5 years after their invention, the answer would be very apparent. However, saying "we just don't know yet" is a fair answer and so far the best answer for bitcoin that I have found. Although 5 years is not a short amount of time in our societies current speed of growth and innovation

* the ability to send and receive payment today is very easy and at least in the USA can be done with zero fees through a number of provider. One example is paypal. Others do it as well. All I need to give someone is my email address. 
* I do agree that the speed and potential for anonymity is a significant innovation. However, currently the best use case for this innovation is black market transactions. This exposes bitcoin to huge regulatory risk. 
* eCommerce has been adopted to the scale in which very few consumers view providing their billing address to a merchant as an issue. I don't believe this is a big enough pain point to drive adoption of a new payment method. 
* In regards to mirco payments and risk of single party failure. There are many crowdsourced funding companies in existence. I do not see a huge challenge those applications have nor how bitcoin would solve it in a significant manner.

If this is the comparable year for bitcoin to the internet in 2003, then bitcoin is even further behind other technology innovations than folks like to let on. By 2003, my question would have been laughable for the internet. That's 3 years AFTER,  the dot com boom and bust.

Bitcoin does not appear to address the reason many folks in the developing world do not use banking or credit cards. If it does, which challenges does it solve for those communities?

Agreed. A similar point was made in another comment. However, serving this se case is such a small small need, it does not warrant the term revolutionary in regards to bitcoin.

Agreed, 3% is significant. However, it is not large enough to allow for savings to be passed on to consumers, and therefore give incentive for bitcoin use. Retailers did not start taking credit cards because it was in their best interest. They would prefer cash. However, consumers adopted credit cards because it provided a great service to them. Retailers needed to accept them to make sales. Bitcoin is inferior to the current credit card system for consumers.

* Basically you view bitcoin as an essential tool for society after the collapse of the current governmental structure, or at least after a larger migration to a more globalized society. I think that is a very fair point, but really puts bitcoin into a futurist category for application generations from now.
* Can you expand on your investment point? How does investing into a blockchain contract protect me as an equity investor without government provided civil courts? In the end, bitcoin or no bitcoin, someone can commit fraud and once committed a government enforced civil court system is your recourse. I also disagree with your premise that the cost of equity investment is high. A trip to the library and some fairly straightforward partnership documents are all it takes.

* The Printing Press &amp; the Car provided over 10X improvement vs hand written books and maintaining a horse. Bitcoin does not provide that level of innovation over the modern banking system. 
* Agreed on your second point that for the use case of moving large sums of currency from once place to another without the use of a bank, bitcoin is a solution. However, this is a very rare use case. So applicable, but not revolutionary. It's not printing information or replacing daily travel by horse.

That's fair. "We just don't know yet" appears to be the best answer as of now.

Do you believe these small business owners would offer a 5% discount to purchases made with bitcoin? If so, also address why these business owners today do not offer a 5% discount for cash purchases. 
BillmeLater was a payment processor that offered merchants a 1% fee and no charge backs. I'm not aware of any merchant that offered any savings to consumers.  When I implemented it on a major ecommerce site in the US, the use was less than 1% after 6months because it's value proposition to consumers was low compared to credit cards. It's now been bought by paypal. I'm not familiar with it's current offering.

This is a list of things bitcoin could be used for, not things that have a problem demanding a solution. Bitcoin basically serves as a better mouse trap, but not a 10X better mouse trap.

There are many payment processors that will offer a flat fee at this price point for transactions at scale. As an individual making a single transfer, it will not be priced this low. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 19:12:34
So my take away is no. Theoretically the technology of bitcoin is better but no company currently offers a competing service to ACH transfers.
