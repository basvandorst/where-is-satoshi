I take it that you've never actually managed at least 10+ houses right?
Tenants are a bitch, they don't pay or they delay payment, especially in the lower priced rentals; you pick low quality, you're going to get low quality. Your income ends up varying. The worst part is when they are several states over, so you have to either have a friend or hire someone to do it for you (i.e. 10% property manager).

Remember, many people here are blinded by visions of great wealth; they strive to be at the very top (the very thing they despise!) and therefore will reassure themselves that their investment is perfect. Unless consumer adoption is swift, BTC stands practically no chance because people naturally either a.) panic or b.) are greedy. People talk about no regulations, but what about taxation and money laundering? BTC is perfect for laundering dirty money; which pretty much kills the whole argument that Bitcoin is beneficial to fighting corruption, because honestly, its **first practical usage** came from the need for a vehicle to move illegal funds  (*Silkroad 1.0*). Governments usually will not allow anything they cannot tax, and that can be proven with historical references.
I mean look at the denial, they don't even want to hear the opposing argument.

Assuming you actually have a Chinese bank account. It's not that easy you know.
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:07:50
China employs strict currency regulations that are designed to prevent large amounts of currency moving out of the country. Your small amount may not seem like a huge deal, but if everyone moved out a few thousand dollars, it would impact upon China’s economy. China has a huge problem with corruption, and they try to curb it with extremely tight banking regulations. I have discussed with several colleagues about how we can benefit from this and came to the conclusion that capital flight is extremely simplified with the usage of Bitcoins (and thus came to the idea of opening up a pathway for facilitation for the many Chinese that want to leave).

When the Chinese entered, BTC went to $400 I believe. 
The Congressional hearings made it skyrocket to $900 and then a drop back to $700...
then a rally up to $1200 after the media started to report on it daily. 
$1200 couldn't hold for long and dropped (low volume...holidays) to $900. 
Rumors of the Chinese backing out came a few days ago and the price dropped to $800ish. 
Yesterday, there was a report that the Chinese banned third party processors hence a drive down to $600; and it wasn't even confirmed.

Disruptive yes. Although decentralized, how can you make sure that the current exchangers/BTC power holders are not manipulating the prices?

If you guys really think China will pop a bubble just like that and cause thousands of angry speculators to complain about the government, well then, you don't understand "harmonization". There's what, one article on it? The Chinese market follows the trends of the American market and vice versa; by panic-selling you guys are just shooting yourselves in the foot via negative-feedback. The only winners are the ones with buy orders
It's painful to see how much can manipulate the price of BTC. It's ridiculous how you guys can cheer on an authoritarian dictatorship and then bag on it once it starts diverging from your own interests.

Contrary to popular belief, in times of panic, the Chinese investors follow the trends of the American investors.
This phenomena was seen a day ago, when the PBOC announced that financial institutions are not to touch BTC. It didn't affect the Chinese market much until the Americans started selling off, then the weak hands in China followed.

HAHAHAHAH THIS IS SO TRUE
@_date: 2013-11-29 07:28:57
China is only a strong economy on paper. Much data is falsified since the country still uses many ideals from the Mao period; some of which are the quota, promotion and guanxi systems. China is a country full of bubbles. One example would be the SHCOMP, which fell from a high of 6000 to 2000 in a matter of days. The CPC knows that the RE bubble will pop one day once they slow the printing of RMB or if the US decides to start a currency war...sounds familiar? Almost every province in China has a huge debt problem (as in bigger than the US), but the central bank keeps printing.
Bitcoin is just another gamble to keep things running smooth for the CPC. If the gamble pays off, we all win. If not, well then, greed killed the coin.
In short, China is running a scam too.

Yes, that's how selling anything works.
Buy X at a lower price and sell X for a higher price. Exchange X for fiat or goods via intermediary's.
Due to the volatility of Bitcoin though, i'm not sure if this is the right investment for you. You will see many ups and downs. It is more of a "i'll just keep it there for 5 years and see what happens" thing.

At first it'll be small businesses like coffee shops and independent music labels.

It depends if the negatives of regulating BTC outweigh the negatives of allowing BTC to function unregulated to the CPC. 
The CPC calculates every move, and the move usually has to be beneficial to the party and general stability. A mass exodus of money would definitely have the CPC saying no, then again the prospect of a currency war would definitely have the CPC trying to hedge against one.
So, it depends, but capital flight from China is a huge problem.

Wrong, it's just a market and fad right now (for now). It has barely any usage in daily society at the moment, meaning that it is only bought and sold like a speculative stock. Only two stores in China at the moment accept BTC as payment, yet China is fueling the growth of BTC? That's because the Chinese are speculating on the BTC, just like they did with the SHCOMP and the real estate market. I guarantee you that only &lt;10% of the people on this subreddit are truly interested in the revolutionary effects of the Bitcoin, whereas 90% of the people (probably 99% of the subscribers that joined in the past 4 days) on this subreddit are just looking to make a quick buck.

You're always going to be met with strongly favorable opinions of BTC, since well, many people here invested a lot of money into BTC and therefore must always reassure themselves that their investment is good. And i'll bet you a whole lot of them are teenagers hoping to become millionaires.
Yes, the lack of any real value is a strong threat to Bitcoin, because it's backed by nothing. Like, literally nothing except confidence. They talk about all this crap about blockchains and being electronic, but think about it, what is it really backed by? Confidence is what is pushing it, and as you have noticed, Bitcoin has seen barely any usage until this week. Although many people have strong opinions of the USD, they do not realize that the USD is still backed with the full support of the government of the United States with a GDP of 15.68 trillion, the confidence of 67% of the world and the world's most powerful military (probably in history).
There is definitely legitimate threat from competing currencies. Let's say someone decides to mass market Litecoins, all of a sudden people are enticed to using/holding Litecoins especially due to its much cheaper price. Most people expect Bitcoin to become at least a competitor to the current credit card industry, and that's what I see Bitcoin most as, a competitor to the current forms of finance...and that's really it. There's always the talk of first-adoption, but that's a story for later.
Consumer adoption will be fairly slow due to the extreme volatility. Unless BTC can became truly stable, adoption will never happen and BTC will probably fall to worthless prices. Unless the Chinese keep pumping the market of course. Here's an example of what happens when Chinese people dump a market -  (SHCOMP)
People will always accept gold more because it is ingrained in our psychology; we are still animals and we like shiny things, preferably rare too. Gold has been used as a median of exchange for a few millenias already.
Those are my two cents really. There is also one thing i'd like to add; with all the fervor in the US and Chinese government about Bitcoins, people should ask themselves, why? Who really is Satoshi Nakamoto? Is this just another way of redistribution to a truly global currency? People need to think instead of blindly following money.
Note: long BTC, just thinking rationally.

That's the front page, A16 would be the main paper page containing the article.

Yeah, sorry I couldn't do it.

Only invest as much as you are willing to lose.
@_date: 2013-12-17 09:42:48
Because you would like to buy back in at $31
oh wait

The inevitable decline (every week) was coming, but the FUD news yesterday exacerbated the decline.

Wow, TIL the Dow went up 1000% in a month according to OP.
My god.
@_date: 2013-11-23 10:12:27
Very likely.

You spend all your money on Bitcoins.

Report it to your bank. Most banks have consumer protection and a maximum of a $50 penalty as long as you report it immediately.

My pawn shop will happily accept it for a bit above melt value. My local jewelry shop will happily accept it for a bit above melt value also. Your point?
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:38:53
In short, yes unless they recover it themselves.
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:56:35
Come on man, you honestly accepted that ACH would deposit your money immediately? It doesn't work like that; it takes out money faster than clearing funds back into your account. You attempted to withdraw from your account when you didn't have enough money, you should've realized that.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:53:49
I'm not trying to be a dick, but no one is going to spoon feed you lessons of arbitrage.


Then test it out. Most people who want to try it out don't even have access to a Chinese bank.
With that said, i'll leave this here. 1% fee, 2 day withdrawal wait
@_date: 2013-11-22 13:39:06
I notice many sections where you revert.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:22:29
Virtual item. You're out of luck I believe. Buy local or from trusted vendors. Sorry for your loss.
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:07:00
I have the same one. Congrats.

This is why I highly dislike this subreddit now. It's full of idiots.

Why don't you try it out yourself?
@_date: 2013-12-18 03:09:39
I agree with this completely.

First of all, we need a large pool of BTC to sell, as in a large volume. 
Second of all, there needs to be a person on both sides; preferably with the ability to instantly exchange between CNY and USD.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:07:52
Start with Coinbase, and use ACH. BTC will be sent within 4 days, and then you can exchange to LTC using a variety of services.
Feel free to message me if you have any questions.

People in China do not have many investment options.
One major option was real estate (we saw what happened).
Another was the stock market (which fell from 6,000-&gt;2,000).
So I expect BTC to rally like a beast, especially once it becomes mainstream in Chinese society.
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:03:04
Person living in China here. 
The companies are government/state owned.
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:30:44
It doesn't matter much. All these media reports that come out...can't hurt the rise of Bitcoin now that the grind is in full swing.
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:10:40
Do you remember anything the pass had?

Bitcoins are capped at 21 million in circulation.

Simple. I don't go on sketch websites. I stick to a normal regimen of already well known websites.
I used to work with this stuff. Trust me, antivirus is useless against zero days, java drivebys and FUDs. A person that wants to steal your Bitcoins will pay $10 to obfuscate his trojan.
Also, avoid IE.
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:25:23
No idea, I don't use Tenpay. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:50:17
This has large implications. This exposes BTC to a hundred million people. It seems that China Telecom is testing the waters for BTC usage.
China Mobile and Unicom will soon follow.
Also, this is an ad for a special offer, if you spend 500rmb in BTC, you get 1000rmb in subsidized crap or something...(probably the phone)
Remember, China Telecom is a state run company. This insinuates that the state officially supports the usage of BTC.
anddddd...i'm buying back in...was a bear, now a super bull...
