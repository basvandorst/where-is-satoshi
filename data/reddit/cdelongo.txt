 Nice try man. Best of luck to you and your parents. Dealing with a failure has to be tough. I applaud their bravery.
PS don't blow all their money on BTC.

Why would I be angry? You tried to interjected context to save face. That is hilarious. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:31:03
Your comment is a giant pile of shit.
Nobody is fully aware of what is in the drugs they take unless they grow or make them. What did they cut your drugs with when you buy from someone that is not your dealer? Oh right you have no idea and now you get to hope it doesn't introduce new hazards! 
You can put whatever you want in your body, You just have to move to certain areas to do it legally. 
There is a reason Moonshine is illegal vs other forms of Alcohol. 


Really? How many people that didn't smoke pot now smoke pot in CO? 
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:26:17
You literally just tried to interjected context to try and save your points while trying to discredit mine. I would break it down but we both know it would fall on deaf ears. 
Godspeed little kid and nice try moving the field goals! It has been a joy watching you fail multiple times, In a way I feel like I can relate with what your parents deal with now.
[TLDR this sums up your post](
Really the only thing you brought to this conversation with substance were downvotes. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:44:05




That's the fucking point. I am using his own claim against him and you are getting upset. Want to prove me wrong. Prove him right.


Again this goes directly against his claim and where is your source on that 99%? Clearly you can back that up right?




You literally made everyone dumber by responding with a pointless  rant that only served to make you look stupid. Thanks! 
@_date: 2015-05-29 22:13:52


Any regulated substance. You never said regulated.


HOW IN THE WORLD COULD MORE PEOPLE USING LEGAL DRUGS = MORE DEATHS! 
I like how you are now moving the point from Legalized Heroin to Legalized drugs so it includes all. Nice save!
Ya for moving field goals so you can save face! 
@_date: 2015-05-30 04:38:55
You can't claim HEROIN then when you realize how dumb it is later change your mind on the point. That is literally moving the field goal.
@_date: 2015-05-30 02:32:05
Shriek lol! 
The all caps was pointing out how stupid that line of thought was. Then I pointed out how dumb it was that you changed your point from Heroin to all drugs. Really if you can't follow that you are pretty dumb.
@_date: 2015-05-29 22:39:44
I love how you keep trying to prove you did something besides make yourself look stupid. This is great. Please keep going :)
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:49:16


Not the same as saying this at all.


Literally a completely different point. We all know you can trust Teens! 
Really how could you even begin to think that is a good claim?


Again this doesn't back you up at all. Where is your source that non users are not now users? That is your claim. Stop trying to change it.


Again pulling stuff out of your ass to try and prove claims that is unprovable. Assumptions are not facts. Really comparing crack smokers to Car Drivers? That is a horribly stupid comparison. 


Here we go even farther into your tangent. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 13:14:42
So FIAT &gt; BTC &gt; Local Bitcoin to cash out is a better less ridiculous way? Adding a new middle man doesn't seem like a better way. Then the whole. Having to trust a stranger with no fraud protection to boot. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 21:35:43
You are applying my comment to the wrong person dumb ass. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 14:53:37
Weird how in no way does he mention what you just described. 
Really you just made up something to avoid my point of it being worse than FIAT. Then said you wouldn't respond because I posted in buttcoin, Are you that insecure? 
@_date: 2015-03-09 23:11:27
It's clear you just add whatever context you want. So trying to have a conversation with you is pointless. So thanks for the laugh and making an alt account just for BTC is sad. Godspeed kid. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 03:04:49
What gas station chain takes bitcoin? 
@_date: 2015-02-17 02:15:28
So you agree with the headline? You are literally doing mental gymnastics to somehow make this not a bad thing for BTC and bad thing for FIAT.
@_date: 2015-02-17 04:57:35
I'm sure if you look hard enough you will find the joke.
@_date: 2015-02-19 02:37:46
I don't think everyone considers exchanges charities. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 02:01:36
A Billion is a lot less of the total of Fiat compared to Mt.Gox accounting for 7% of all BTC. So honestly the title should be completely reversed.
@_date: 2015-02-17 01:56:19


 
Doesn't destroy big banks as much as highly intelligent BTC users.


Doesn't enable user to take down the tyrants at HSBC! 
BTC doesn't cause Autism! In fact it embraces people with it. 


Please bro with BTC you don't even have to work and neither do other BTC users. We are changing the world one post at a time.
 I don't need one with a 2FA Cold Wallet!


I don't need those since I don't leave my house!
I think BTC is clearly the best thing in the past 500 years. Followed by Blockchain at  and Sidechains at  
@_date: 2015-02-17 02:36:11
You are stuck acting like the Mt. Gox loss wasn't worse.. It was.
@_date: 2015-02-20 12:53:06
A form of currency that has less than 2,000 actual users daily is not something worth waiting time implementing. Hell how many times have we seen places decide to take BTC and receive 0 sales from it? 
@_date: 2015-02-16 21:37:48
TIL BTC is more disruptive than Electricity, Cars, Automatic weapons and the invention of the Internet. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 05:10:20
I have never seen a credit card transaction on my bank account more than 24 hours later. Can you provide proof of one 90 days later?
@_date: 2015-02-17 02:23:29
How the fuck am I cherry picking data when the title is talking about the data I mentioned? 


The title said a 1 Billion dollar heist makes Mt Gox look like pocket change. Now let's apply some thought to this.
* The heist accounts for less than 1% of all FIAT on earth. We both agree on that right? Good moving on.
* Mt Gox accounted for 7% of the total of all BTC on earth. We both agree on that right? Good moving on.
Now when we compare less than 1% to 7% we can clearly see that the heist is in fact does not make Mt. Gox look like pocket change. 
I have no idea how you can't understand that.
@_date: 2015-03-10 00:35:34
There is no point in chasing your point when you are making your own context to my words. 
You haven't corrected anything I said and only did the typical BTC fundie method of attempting framing an argument you can win. It's great watching you hit all the cliches really. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 05:11:07
I don't know what Litecoin is, I am guessing it is somehow taken in less places than BTC?
@_date: 2015-02-17 02:08:40
You are moving the field goal and saying Mt.Gox was only 7% of the total of a underdeveloped market so it's ok. Now 1 Billion accounting for far less than 7% should be a much larger deal on a developed market. Really? If 7% of any form of FIAT was stolen BTC would never stop talking about it. But since it didn't  happened to BTC a theft of less than 1% is a huge deal and good for BTC. Hell the past week the 3 Exchanges getting hacked are a much larger impact than the 1 on a FIAT bank.
@_date: 2015-02-18 23:24:32
They are trying to act as a 3rd party that offers it. It's also not a reversal as much as a 3rd party Audit.  If you read their FAQ the trust agent can charge a fee and they plan on introducing them in the future. So you will soon be charged 2x for a transaction on top of whatever BTC fees you already have. 






So plan is to build a base when free and charge when they run out of VC money. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 04:42:34
If BTC users* trusted them with their money who am I to say they are not telling the truth when they say that? 
I also am not going to dig around that bullshit to please you. You can though to discredit me! 
@_date: 2015-02-16 03:15:02
Assuming BTC can be accepted anywhere is massive assumption. What else are we assuming, 0 confirmation transactions to match credit card sales? 
@_date: 2015-02-17 02:30:03
So you are just ranting that you can't steal 7% of FIAT. Good but I don't care and nobody does. If you read my point before you went off on a tangent, I clearly said the title should be reversed and I have shown why. Not sure why you are stuck on defending BTC here.
@_date: 2015-02-20 04:30:53
Can you explain why they would cater to such a niche user base instead of streamlining it to simpler methods? 
What is the user base with BTC going to be 1-2,000 daily maybe if they are extremely lucky? 
*Lol they take PayPal!
