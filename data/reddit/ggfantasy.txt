Congratulations to winners in the biggest freeroll (according to unique users) -  
I’d also like to mention that two Tottenham players got more than 20 points. Both Dele Alli and Harry Kane scored twice and brought 21.1 and  21.2 points. One more important observation: Stoke City lost 0-4, but despite this heavy defeat, Ibrahim Afellay got 11.1 points for active playing. That’s a great example that match results don’t influence fantasy points your players bring.
Every two weeks we update player salaries. For example, Iwobi (Arsenal) cost $11 mln, and now he costs $15 mln, having consolidated his place in the starting 11. And Darlow, Newcastle’s third goalkeeper now costs $12 mln instead of 9, as two other keepers are injured.
This makes drafting a team and finding value more difficult, but salaries get more true-to-life. So it’s just a new challenge.
