Great question! This attack is known as [email spoofing]( (not many people know that you can *send* an email as anyone).
I prevent it by sending a confirmation email with every transaction, so a transaction can't go through unless the attacker has access to *read* your email. 
Email Tip Bot is, therefore, as secure as your email account.

Developer here. This is a prerelease to the community to test out before I publish it further, so there may still be some rough edges and edge cases I'm not handling beautifully.
I'll be damned if this isn't one of the most secure things I've ever made, though.
Please let me know if you encounter any issues or have ideas to improve the service!

I just fell for this - an absolutely beautiful attack. I realized two seconds after entering my two-factor authentication that it was phishing, so I was able to change my password immediately. The seeming integration with Zoho is what got me.
Looks like the attacker logged in from Chrome for Windows from 198.187.30.116, but was only on for about two minutes before I logged out of all other sessions ("Details" in the bottom right of gmail). I can't imagine what kind of havoc the attacker may have wrought with ongoing access to my email. I'm pretty paranoid as to what could have been downloaded in those two minutes, too.
I think a good chunk of tomorrow will be spent reviewing my security strategy! This was an excellent wake up call.
To whomever orchestrated this attack: well played. Your attention to detail is exquisite.
Edit: lol

If you can get someone's email address on Imgur or twitter!

...oh whoa, that was unintentional. Thanks, autowikibot!
@_date: 2014-02-14 22:35:25
Ahh! I see. No, this is not a Twitter and Imgur bitcoin tip bot, just through email. It looks like bots for those platforms already exist.
@_date: 2014-02-14 22:30:52
I'm confused. You want to send bitcoins from an Imgur account to a twitter account?

I have friends that have given me weekly quotas of things I can make them sign up for :(
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:32:09
That's the plan!

Every time I read your comments:

Money cannot buy you happiness, only time and freedom.
Follow this man's advice: 
He retired at 30 after making his fortune (~$800K) the old fashioned way, and is now one of the happiest people alive.

Ditto. I would have thought we would've been the first to hear about this new pricing plan...
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:37:45
MMM's perspective is that you don't need nearly as much money as you think you do to buy that freedom. It's more about not spending money.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:25:31
That's fair. The biggest barrier to entry that I've seen so far, however, is acquiring bitcoins from USD. You have to have bought pretty far into it before you're willing to hand over your address, social security number, and whatever other personal details Coinbase is requiring for new accounts these days.
Perhaps if I said something like "I'll give you these bitcoins to give to these charities that accept bitcoin"? That way they have experience with both holding coins and performing a transaction.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:27:25
That would be more thoughtful, but the point is to get more people on the network and comfortable with holding money (even though it's only $10) in a digital wallet on their computer.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:30:17
Yeah, they have been :p
My rationale is that the future success of bitcion depends on a large userbase of people actually making transactions on it. More people with bitcoin = more people accept bitcoin = more people get bitcoin, etc. That seems to be enough to get them to take my money.
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:24:36
That's right ToTheMoonGuy, the price of bitcoin is going to the moon.

[Indefinitely]( actually.
@_date: 2013-11-20 03:24:04
Ditto. That one was disturbingly easy (one of the smallest keyspaces but the second highest prize).
It's bruteforcin' time!

Coinbase is one of the better places to buy, but they've run out at the moment, unfortunately.
