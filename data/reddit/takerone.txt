To the Moon! And I wish this for every cryptocurrencies.
+13.37 doge

I was thinking about the same thing in regard of Facebook. Dogecoin is trying to be the social networks' tipping money, and currently people are trying to get it accepted by FB to work align with FB's TOS to use it for tipping. If FB wanted something like this on it's page, it could easily make it happen, since next to Google, they have the most efficient way to get messages or ideas to people, as we log in and look at their page every day.
BUT I think the main reason this is not happening, is that using cryptocurrencies as they work today would be incredibly unfair. People who mined first have ridiculous amount of coins, cryptocurrencies' "in-built wealth distribution" is just something that is unacceptable for sites like FB or Google.

After reading this I'm glad that some of my $s are on their way to my VoS acc at the moment :-)

Lol thanks. It's reflecting jokingly on the tipping culture. :-)

ELI5 what do they comment and what's the point?
@_date: 2018-10-10 07:07:46
Most probably one of these (php):
    array openssl_get_cipher_methods ([ bool $aliases = FALSE ] )
Trying through all is very easy. Finding the passphrase/key/iv is the problematic part. :-D
@_date: 2018-10-10 10:29:07
Yeah exactly but what's the logic behind creating a new acc for each new comment? I just don't understand.

4k months is more that 333 years. I doubt you were here for that long. :-P
@_date: 2018-06-25 14:52:07
Very true.

If you had bitcoin at the time of the fork (August 1.) you're supposed to have BCH. Either you need to have the private key to the wallet in question or had to have your BTC on an exchange/online wallet that credited you the BCH after the fork.

I knew I should buy ETH for $7 last December but didn't have money... guess how happy I was to see what happened after I got some to spare.

Wait so why did she need to check her wallet to see the price change? :-D Something doesn't add up in this story.
