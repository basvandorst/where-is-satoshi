No, before math has to brush its teeth and can play 15mins game theory if it likes to. ;)

still on the BTC blockchain

I never followed CSW at anytime, nor did I even interfere with him on Twitter.
But I'm blocked by him  xD
Maybe it's because I had "discussions" with Roger and other BTrash-related accounts. xD

Still, you can use your BTC

The problem with "updating" is, that you will never make all BTC privat keys quantum proof, as there are too many "lost bitcoins" or rather lost privat keys for the access of these bitcoins.
I mentioned this topic also a few times, but get always downvoted for. ':D
Have a look at the Quantum Resistant Ledger and the quantum resistant blockchain that they just launched 2 months ago. I think it's worth a read.
Google, IBM, Microsoft and other minor companies are rapidly exploring and building the bases for quantum computers that coule break ECDSA in the future (5-10 years; maybe even sooner).
Quantum Computing was more than far off when the Bitcoin Protocol was developed and not really seen as a threat.
But it gives more and more worriesome the more developments in QC are reached.
This reddit post gives you a bit more information than I am capable of to give:

Why would I need advice from someone about how long I should hold money. ��
It's everyone's personal decision told hold on something and exchange it for something.

never heard of that before... as it's a German bank they underlie the same jurisdictions as the other banks in Germany and as I happened to work in a bank before, I know that normally banks only freeze bank accounts do to some regulatory reasons, like when they are forced by law or if they suspect any criminal behaviour
but not for any random tactical reasons or whatsoever

this should answer your question

The energy spent by miners controbutes to an independent financial system.
These costs are far lower than the waste of energy that is produces by the currwnt centalised financial system.
And I don't mean the costs for transactions or gold mining or storing costs or anything like that.
The current financial system enables wars that are financed by cheap, unsound money for which the population has to pay by inflation and recessions in later times.
Take the Irak war for instance. In the beginning it was said that the war in Irak wouldn't cost more than roughly $15bn-$20bn.
It ended up between $1tn-$2tn.
Nobody in the world would have paid that price in advance. Only the mechanisms of the Central Banks made it possible to finance this war which wasted horrific amonts of energy ressources and lifes.
Wars in the 20th and 21st century are mainly financed by cheap, easy reproducable money.
So the costs of these wars are way higher than the in comparison small amount of energy that is used for Bitcoin

And please don't get me wrong here.
Bitcoin won't solve conflicts between people and countries. It won't stop fights.
But it will pretend governments from financing their wars out of thin air when Bitcoin is used by the majority of people in the world.

I only listened to the audio-book last winter and read it a "2nd" time now, because of some personal work
and I was amazed again by it's content
and wanted some other who might not have read it yet to read it as well ;)

unless that the underlying cryptography of BTC is not quantum proof and therefore all the "sleeping btcs" and "losts btcs" coule easily be claimed by the parties that have the technology for quantum computing

That might be true regarding the fact that he sometimes goes too much into the personal life of Keynes e.g.
But in the end that does not make his economic argumentation wrong.

In my opinion; the Quantum Resistant Ledger is a pretty decent hedge.
Quantum Computing is evolving with such high velocity.
In my eyes; Quantum Computing CAN be a big threat in the coming 5-10 years.
People might say "yeah, we can just upgrade to quantum secure algos"  but it's just not possible to migrate every privat key to qc-secure keys. There are millions of lost bitcoins which will be an easy target.
That's why I hedge my coins with Quantas from QRL.
I hold BTC since 2012 and since then only accumulated a handful of other coins.

check it out for yourself ��
there is also a slack for this project
the team members are very active on reddit and slack and will likely answer any tech-related questions you have
their cryptography is not based on ECDSA (which could, in the future, fall as a victim for qc) but  XMSS which is proven to be quantum resistant
the question is not IF qc with enough qubits will come to crack any ECDSA-based algorythm but rather WHEN
Bitcoin could easily switch it's algo to a qc-resistant algo, but the problem is the switch itself
there are too many privat keys with no owner anymore to be a potential threat in the future
for now we are good,
but give it a look to see why it's maybe worth thinking a few from.now ahead
