From the [definition of "money" in the GST Act]( Bitcoin is clearly a "negotiable instrument used or circulated, or intended for use or circulation, as currency".
The trouble comes in the next bit "(whether of Australia or of any other country)".
It looks like the **intent** of the law is to cover any such instrument, but it was written in &amp; for a different time.
I think I'll wait for the official ATO guidelines before doing anything rash...

Completely fails to do any currency conversion.
My test just charged me 15.5 Doge for a $AUD15.50 sale, same with LTC.
How do I get my $20 back from Envato?

Hi, this is the internet... we don't have a physical address in the UK, we are based in Australia. We do have an arrangement with the world's largest provider of gift cards to do fulfilment for us in the UK and further afield as we grow.
IANAL, but we are in the process of updating our T&amp;C and Privacy Policy and looking into the UK Cookie laws etc... this is all new to us...

You are absolutely correct!
If we had more turnover I'm sure we'd be able to organise better wholesale deals or commissions on the cards and automate processes to reduce our overheads, but at the moment it's a very small market and all of the behind the scenes work requires manual handling.
