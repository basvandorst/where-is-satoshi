Another golden use case of bitcoin. So you can become your own bank and cut these snooping schmucks out of your life forever.

If you get your bitcoin news from MSN, I think it's safe to say you have no idea what the hell you're talking about

Shitty coinbase. Their status page is a steaming sack of lies

Traveling is actually far less "risky" than most people think. IE you are far more likely to die from gun violence in the US than almost any other country.
Unless you're referring to OP selling their btc as risky. Possibly, but at some point you have to cash out and live a little. What's the point in perma-hoarding wealth that can't be easily spent?

I'm expecting way more than 10% at this point. Wouldn't be surprised to see 40-50% pullback

At that amount I personally would definitely move to a hardware wallet. However, everyone has different risk tolerances. Coinbase also has a vault option which is supposedly more secure.

Devils advocate viewpoint: You have the rest of your life (or 30 years) to pay off your mortgage, but will there ever be another opportunity like crypto? Only you can answer that question, but at least it sounds like you've put some thought into it. 
Congrats on the cash out.

Is there a way to buy a ledger from the manufacturer without paying for shipping from France? (I'm in US). Like do they have a US branch? TIA

I'm skeptical of this post.

Watched The Big Short again last night for the first time since I bought into BTC. That movie makes me so angry, and reminds me why I believe bitcoin is a much better system than what banks currently offer.
I agree with you though, just because btc is rocketing to the moon atm does not give anyone license to make retarded financial decisions. God help us in our repeated stupidity...

Fun Fact: the rideshare service Lyft was originally inspired by the founders' trip to Zimbabwe.

Travel, Live life. Experiment with new business ideas.
Spend time with family and friends.
A million dollars in btc won't make me happy. If it happens, great. If not, at least I didn't waste time and energy worrying about it.
