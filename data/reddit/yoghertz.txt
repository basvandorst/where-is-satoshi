Oh yeah don't worry, the whole market will feel the repercussions of this if it blows up. Most alts might even be hit hardest to start with, due to a significant demand for BTC as a means of exiting to FIAT.

No it can't. Using reasonable force in retaliation cannot get you thrown in jail, or at least, not for any notable length of time. We just prefer not to encourage violence to escalate, and largely do an okay job of keeping murder rates down, even if more petty crime is fairly high.

At the risk of relighting a fuse I'm kinda trying to snuff out, I feel like there's at least a small amount of hypocrisy on show over your couple of comments there. But anyway, I apologise, I don't mean to purely offend here, though admittedly I wasn't paying much attention to actually avoiding offending. It genuinely wasn't meant to be a personal insult though.

Hmm? 
@_date: 2018-01-27 14:08:47
It'd be folly to present this as a huge step towards being able to handle the huge traffic we've seen before, but it is a bit of both. 
If we had near the same amount of tx's we saw peaking over the last couple months we'd be in trouble again, no doubt.

That's not the issue at all, the issue is that out of nowhere releasing trading early means those privy to the information can factor in expected prices *before* the announcement. Insider trading, effectively, and I think we're more concerned about people who might get burned buying into BCH high than anything else.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:44:15
Because context is needed to make sense of the situation. If you ask someone to pay you in BTC or something similar, then it's up to you to know that the value could be up or down by the time you get it, and that it can take some time. Presumably, if it is a wage, you must have a good reason for wanting it in BTC too, either you hoped to bypass some steps and wanted to invest in crypto with your wages. Or perhaps you can't/don't want to use the banking system for some reason.
But yes, TX times are too high, regardless of your slightly strange story.

Unfortunately it seems all wealth ends up massively concentrated in a very few hands. Not sure what the current stats are but I remember a few years ago reading an article saying something like 20% of US wealth was held in the top 0.1% of households. Not really sure how other assets or currencies work, but I guess it's a perennial problem that they get concentrated in a minority of very wealthy and powerful hands.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:29:06
Yeah I'm not really being very serious, but yes I'm very excited to see how the market reacts :)
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:23:31
Recoup your original investment in FIAT and then keep the rest invested (if you want to). I'm not sure I'm getting it right, but if they gave you that money for a use distinctly different from investing in BTC then I think it would be fair for them to ask you to take 2k back out. View it as an entirely moral rather than practical decision and then you won't be annoyed if (when) that 2k worth of BTC is worth even more in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:25:01
I think we have to understand that BTC cannot be compared to the dotcom bubble, but equally it could well be in a bubble short-term at the moment. The thing to remember is that if BTC gets anywhere near its long-ish term goals, then even if we are in a bubble now then long-term holders will be mightily rewarded regardless of any temporary bubbles/crashes we experience.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:19:23
It doesn't really make sense unless you labled a whole lot of things that most people would not view as pyramid schemes also as pyramid schemes. As with investing in basically anything, if it succeeds then those who are early win massively, and sometimes those who are late win much less, make no gains, or lose. It's not just pyramid schemes that follow that trend.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:13:54
There are dips all the time, followed by new ATH prices. IMO the dips are going to keep getting smaller though and waiting around for them will be less and less recommended.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:49:48
Is FIAT backed by gold? I thought the definition of FIAT was that it had no 'intrinsic value', just the value assigned to it by the government backing?
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:08:59
It will pull away from altcoins eventually as long as the tech upgrades well enough as we reach widespread adoption (which we are actually still quite far away from imo). But I think there will be a good few coins that retain their value, and some that do very different things to BTC that may shoot up as well, it's just that most alts will decrease in BTC value, rather than becoming 'worthless'.

Bitcoin peaked at literally $500 value below what I was gonna sell a little bit for, for insurance, wish I had now but I believe in it and hope it reaches those peaks again! Besides, this. I guess I'm encouraged by the history of Bitcoin crashes, but I still feel like I should've given myself a little more leeway to stop things like this making me bat an eyelid.

What do you mean no control over their money? That's one of Bitcoin's selling points really, that it gives you complete control and responsibility.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:53:48
I can't pretend that I know what I'm talking about, or that the big-time investors can't be wrong, but it gives me a lot of comfort that the price has been fairly stable the past 24 hours. In a time of quite a lot of uncertainty it seems a good thing that there hasn't been much sign of panic in the market this close to futures launching.
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:15:03
Emotions running high, I know it's hard not to resist getting payback against the people that were smug or just obnoxiously enthusiastic about the BTC price but there's been a lot of pretty unnecessary gloating at the losses people have taken. We're all a bit touchy because of the actual losses and the reaction skeptics have directed against us, don't take it too personally or as a good representation of people if they're not that interested in proper debate right now and act defensively. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:40:53

@_date: 2017-12-12 14:33:16
Depends what you want to pursue, if you had that many BTC right now you'd barely have to sell any to be very financially secure FIAT-wise, and I imagine people that accrued that many might want to continue being heavily involved in the crypto world. If you believe it will hit the lofty targets some people are setting for it then I would imagine a lot of people would want to keep enough to be part of the crypto 'elite' in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:44:21
Something like that I guess hahaa, it all seems a bit mad and yes, one thing we shouldn't forget is that this certainly doesn't seem like a process which will move finance, at least in developed countries, towards some sort of loverly even playing field.
It's gonna be a painful process whatever happens, and one thing that even I, who has a relatively strong belief in the idea of cryptocurrency, can't really get my head around is that there are simply so many different coins and how we could possibly need many of them in the 'end-game'. Having said that, I could perhaps just be a little short-sighted, and in all likelihood I am. Sometimes I think the best thing I can say is simply 'I don't really know what's going on or if it's even good, let alone have a good idea about the future'. It's good in principal at least, perhaps.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:20:57
I don't quite understand what you're saying here; you think that 300 billion dollars of 'value' is enough to serve the masses? Because for what I'm talking about, it certainly isn't enough, I don't even have a figure in my head really but I know at least that Bitcoin, or crypto in general, is currently worth many many times less than would be required to have some sort of global economy heavily based on it.
'Masses' being a horribly vague term I know, sorry for choosing it in the first place. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:21:03
Very welcome! Remember that the less valuable the coin, the more successful mining is likely to be in terms of getting a share of found blocks, so ideally you want to be  mining coins yet to blow up which you think might do in the future (talking even smaller than Vertcoin), but then again you can be left with useless coins if they don't gain value. For someone just using their gaming PC or something then mining is often really just a hobby and in terms of making gains just buying a crypto will be better, but if you can't think of anything better to do with your computer overnight or when you're not using it intensively, then you can hopefully make a little profit and contribute to its community :)
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:12:42
I hate BCash, and Roger Ver, but I don't think they're entering a death spiral anytime soon. It's total pseudo analytical chart-nonsense, admittedly, but I think we'll just continue to see these attacks on BTC coinciding with BCash pumps up to 0.2-0.3 BTC per BCash, l getting increasingly lower in peak, then fairly quickly stablising somewhere around the 0.1 mark, then the cycle begins again.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:17:37
Well what constitutes life-changing is probably quite different from person to person. $100 investment is unlikely to make a big difference to quality of life any time soon, but conversely I imagine the loss of it for a lot of people would mean almost nothing to them. If someone only put a few days wages into BTC, then I imagine they might not even consider cashing it out in part until a significant increase, especially because the mid-term for BTC looks relatively rosy at the moment.
It's a matter of preference, but I don't think it always makes sense to weaken your position in BTC by taking out, say 50% of it every time it doubles. Having said that, I certainly would be doing that if I could have invested more initially.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:38:57
For sure, THIS is the time bitcoin dies, the other dips were just practices.

@_date: 2017-12-14 13:12:15
Why don't I possess full bitcoins? Because I didn't understand it until the price was driven up quite a lot and I was encouraged to seek out information about it. I didn't even know it was deflationary until about 4 months ago, I thought it was an endless supply of digital currency that you swapped from FIAT into when you wanted to make shady purchases.

@_date: 2017-12-10 11:17:14
What do you mean 'getting into bed with wall street'? We can't stop anybody using the BTC market however they want to, and the reason wall street is involving themselves with BTC is because it's the biggest crypto with the most exposure and largest market cap. Nothing we can do about it really, but in the end I'm sure that anything that lends legitimacy to BTC as an investment will probably work out okay for us.

I'd take a look at the price graph for BCH and BTC from about November 10th to November 13th 2017. That BCH pump was infinitely scarier than this one, and we all know how BTC fared from late November to mid-December.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:57:39
No, you read that right, but the rate of mining slows dramatically over time as we get closer to the maximum mined coins :)
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:36:50
Right now, you are correct for the most part. I don't doubt that the majority of investors could never be so confident as to think Bitcoin *will* succeed in becoming a widely used common currency for the entire world, though that is the underlying principle as to *why* people *can* speculate on it and put it into a bubble, or at least a bubble in the short-to-medium term. If, of course, Bitcoin gets anywhere near its long-term goals, then the price right now would be many orders of magnitude lower than it would have to be to service the masses.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:16:24
In the past week Bitcoin's market cap increased by about as much as BCH's total market cap right now. BCH appears to be having its moments still, just like every Altcoin that has some good backing.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:04:06
Not alone brother, I just sold all my BCH for BTC but I was an idiot(?) and didn't leave it on an exchange. Would have made another 30% if I'd be better organised. I don't think it'll dump below 2.3k in the next few hours, but I could be wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:25:19
Yeah tether is weird, probably the most major intrusion of bank-like bullshit imaginary money into crypto.

Ah I see where you've misread me there, I said 'the price right now would be many orders of magnitude lower than it would have to be to service the masses'. Pretty shoddy sentence crafting there on my part, I apologise.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:35:31
Investing in Bitcoin, or any crypto, is incredibly easy still if you don't need to move the funds very often or in a hurry. If you're playing with pretty big sums I'm sure you could easily do some trading and moving between wallets and exchanges because even a really high transaction fee will be basically negligible. But yeah, using making lots of small transactions isn't easy right now and LN will hopefully be something of a saviour for us on that front, though I can't really tell how quickly significant effects of it will be felt even after the release.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:51:34
A lot of factors contributed to Bitcoin's massive dip, but I suppose fortunately BTC was the most resistant to the general crypto dip that followed. I think the classic dump in BCH price from the ATH could've been masked by the fact everything dumped a huge amount, but can't say for sure that we won't see a relatively high BCH-BTC ratio for a little while now.
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:03:15

@_date: 2017-12-20 11:13:39
That's not the point he's making, he's comparing it to the November debacle and quite reasonably saying he's encouraged that the dent to BTC's market cap has been far, far less percentage-wise. Not to say more couldn't happen.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:33:51
Because something takes skill doesn't mean there is no element of randomness. I actually sympathise with your sentiment a lot, but I think you've taken it a little too far. Another important thing in these games is that you need to be aware whether you actually have the skill required to make a totally sound judgement, and I think that's the basic idea behind advising caution, even if *that* gets taken too far a lot of the time.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:43:23
Well actually for the past 6 months the trend has been a rise in BTC's share of the crypto market cap, but yes there are scaling issues that hopefully LN will be able to address to some degree, and of course with some of the insane gains Altcoins can make, be it because of pump and dumps, or because they genuinely look like they can add something significant to the space, there has been a lot of money flowing into them. The rise of Altcoins is a storm that all of the bigger cryptos have to weather, and I guess we'll see in time whether Bitcoin can retain the top spot and how many other coins will remain valued alongside it or climb above it, or indeed whether some new crypto will burst onto the scene.
@_date: 2018-09-15 21:30:31
I can't help but feel you could choose your language a bit more aptly because it's all a bit tabloid, but I see what you're getting at. I'm certain there was plenty of the sort of things you're describing though, but it's perhaps a little cynical to so readily disregard the possibility some of it came from a purer and more genuine enthusiasm; it was the flavour of the month(s) and some of us were really enjoying discussion, despite the fact a lot of it was just a positive feedback loop. 
I'm a little bit surprised you chose to highlight those comments of mine but I suppose your thinking may be that my quite sensibly presented answers were a front for a subtler and more insidious variety of manipulation.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:25:16
Yeah sorry, I'm not offended in the slightest, and I actually agree with a lot of what you said, I just found your tone slightly amusing. But yes, I think even the most enthusiastic Bitcoiners realised we were in a bubble at least in the short-term.
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:37:23
Trust me, if you're worried that you don't have enough money to invest by buying bitcoin then you are nowhere near in a situation to make pursuing mining bitcoin worth it. But yes, you would have to join a pool. 
If you have a good rig though I suggest mining altcoins, in my opinion ZCash or Vertcoin are two very good ones that just require a good graphics card to make a few dollars profit a day depending on electricity, and obviously if the coins increase in value then you could make a lot more by hoarding them. I would choose Vertcoin personally.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:06:04
Shell out extra to what? Have the same fiat value worth of bitcoin? Yes. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:45:37
It does say 'token mining', not bitcoin mining. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:35:24
Well the problem is that Bitcoin is going to have to go through a very long process of finding its value, and it's a good point that until it nears its peak and price growth slows down then it will be harder for people to part with it to actually buy things with, because they'll be concerned that the goods they bought will be worth less than the bitcoin they spent a week later or whatever. 
However, it is definitely much more spendable than most other stores of value (stocks, gold etc.), so having a sizeable portion of ones wealth in bitcoin does have an advantage over those in that conversion is not always necessary if you wanted to spend it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:35:24
Matter of perspective in a sense, I have some student debts and put a fair amount of my 'spare' cash into Bitcoin a few months back kinda thinking that I would need a hell of a lot more money to break free of the 9-5 until my 50s, so thought this could be my one gambit at liberating myself. Having said that, student debt here in the UK isn't much of a big deal, if I don't earn enough money to make me pretty well-off I won't really have to pay back very much.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:28:45
The only reservation I have myself is that the fees are high enough to discourage people to invest in small amounts of BTC, and the currency is already stacked in favour of a few now very wealthy people anyway. For serious investors who just want to get in now in anticipation of future developments and more widespread adoption, it's much less of an issue. It would be a fair point that we're still so far away from finding a reasonable value for BTC that fees aren't too much of a problem right now.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:37:02
Thing is, BCash is faring slightly better right now, but still has dropped a lot more over the last 24 hours or so.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:49:46
I think the cost of setting up LN channels is basically negligible compared to the fees saved by opening them. It's my understanding that opening one will be that of an on-chain transaction fee, which although is expensive if you wanted to use the channel for a transaction once or twice or just a few times only for yourself and one other party, then it would be fairly pointless, but the network as a whole will mean that this won't be the case, because the average user can utilise the whole network (or, pardon the word, a 'chain' of channels) to get connected with a whole bunch of useful addresses they can interact with. I believe an analogy was made that, for a goods-buying example, you connect with the internet to make a transaction, rather than simply connecting with, say Amazon.
But yes, it will have to grow and be adopted, but unless there are some glaring problems I don't see why it wouldn't be adopted to the levels needed because it will allow the cheap transactions to take place, and also help to take pressure off the on-chain transaction count. The ease of use will be the main issue I suppose, and I'm afraid I can't really comment on what that will be like.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:02:17
It was left as something of an open question by Satoshi I believe; fairly certain he voiced that both the blocksize would have to scale upwards and off-chain solutions would be needed as well. However, I think there was a sentiment that the smallest block possible to still allow good function was preferable for security reasons, but that might have been an afterthought, not really sure.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:33:52
I may be wrong but I believe his wallet has been identified and that it still contains the million or so BTC. If anything I think I'd be quite happy if he'd cashed it out because that would mean the consequences of him doing so would have already been felt. It suits the nature of BTC to not have its creator strutting about anyway because of the sentiment of collective effort.
@_date: 2018-09-17 19:45:06

Definitely trying to prod him, but sometimes people need to be probed to reveal parts of their personality which lurk beneath their smooth exterior. The interviewer was quite unprofessional in this, but I imagine he might justify it as an attempt to show how shallow Roger really is, something that Roger would hardly be likely to show unless under duress. Amazed Roger took the bait to be honest, I'd have thought he'd be better trained in this considering his background.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:26:10
No, I'm talking about BTC, not cryptos.
But yes, of course, I recognise that BTC can be threatened by another cryptocurrency/cryptocurrencies, hell we already have a number of relatively successful offshoots of the Bitcoin chain (BCash, BGold). That is certainly one of my main concerns, though in many ways I think that's why a lot of people choose BTC; because it has quite a lot of financial backing and therein some degree of security, though of course compared to gold, silver, and oil still far less. Some might say that it's important for BTC to remain in-and-around the top of the market for the good of crypto as a whole because otherwise, as you suggest, there could be little faith in any crypto retaining its value medium-to-long-term. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:37:17
There's no inherent value in any nation's currency. The tangibility of them is part for convenience, and perhaps partly reliquary. But yes, it is unnecessary, unless you don't want to have to use and hold an inflationary currency. Not to sound patronising but you really need to research some basic issues crypto aims to address. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:57:44

@_date: 2017-12-09 18:31:13
Just please don't go into this thinking of the short-term. Of course we can all respect that if BTC drops downwards a significant percentage some people will feel they have to sell, but honestly for the sake of everyone with BTC I hope investors both new and old remember that BTC has dropped again and again by amounts that in probably any other investment could look like a death spiral, and again and again it rises even higher in the end. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:22:36
I'm not entirely well versed on LN myself, but from what I understand the LN will spread out until you can basically connect to anybody you want to through existing channels. On-chain transactions will then be used perhaps for larger transfers, perhaps moving large amounts of funds between your own wallets or something where a relatively large transaction fee and/or time is less of an issue.
But yes, until there are enough channels then you won't be able to send cheap microtransactions to whatever place you want to. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:17:33
There's nothing that it is backed by in the vein of things you seem to be searching for, but belief backs it, and a key part of that belief is that it doesn't need any backing except the value placed on it by other users and speculators. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:35:51
I really don't have time to go into this, not least because there are a lot of people who can explain it to you much better than me, but yes, you are right, bitcoin's value is only based on usability, scarcity, security and relatively widespread usage. The extra value is based on what wager people are placing on how those things will be in the future. Its value is comparable to a deflationary FIAT which is backed by the group of people volunteering to use it rather than any government coercing people to use it.

Either way you'll likely be frustrated and/or elated in the short-term because it goes up and down so often. If you don't really need the money you're investing I'd put in a fair bit now seeing as we seem to have found support at this current price, maybe half now and half in whatever time frame you think it suitable. A lot of people hang around waiting for a dip, yet most would agree that day trading is a bad idea, so personally I think just lumping in what you can, when you can is the best way to stop yourself getting into any mindset that encourages you to think you can time the markets particularly well.

Even assuming he is alive, has access, and wants to massively cash out, why would he dump them all in a short window when he can slowly do so with far less effect on the market? The only worrying thing would be if the coins started to move then people would worry about him dumping them, I'm sure an actual massive dump on his behalf would be incredibly unlikely but the anticipation of his cashing out would probably be the major problem facing us.

Nah not to do with the price, just the amount of coins in circulation (technically speaking, dependent on which 'hash block' we are at) :)

Well I'm a bit conflicted by it, on the one hand I don't think we should be taking offence at anybody trying their hand in this very much free crypto market, but as with any other crypto it can concern us if it looks to be shady for whatever reason (a much better example than BCH would be some of the money-grabbing ICO projects). 
I don't think too many people are concerned about actual usurpation, but are either frustrated by a few things:
- BCH perceived as, more than any other coin, taking part of BTC's market cap (fairly greedy reason).
- BCH perceived as confusing new investors and in some way threatening the reputation of BTC and/or crypto.
- The moral compass of BCH's major proponents (Ver, Wu, for example) doubted; very much a matter of opinion, but certain instances have really not helped dispel these sentiments.
- View that BCH and other forks in some way have tried to undermine the idea of consensus, which is a particularly prominent principle for Bitcoiners.
- Simple fact that BCH's goal appears to be to usurp Bitcoin not only in adoption, but crucially wants to actually be known as 'Bitcoin'; this is quite a hard thing to take lightly, because that certainly seems like a direct attack on Bitcoin. It's understandable that people take considerable offence to that, regardless of how successful BCH is or might become.

In my opinion you've basically missed the boat at this stage. It may go up a bit at some stage before GDax/coinbase open, but I fear once they do it will dump down, and there's a good chance it will dump before that in anticipation of that. I think right now the potential profits are quite low and the potential losses quite high, earlier today or in the past couple of days it would've been a very good move, but not now I don't think.

Transaction time is the only issue as long as you aren't playing with pittance. I've only used Bittrex, but the transaction times tend to only be about an hour there tops for me, so I actually think it must be quite feasible to swap large amounts of money between exchanges if they have similar transaction times and allow your funds to be available fairly quickly after they've come in. When there is a major pump on Korean exchanges it must be feasible to do it to some extent for anyone with enough BTC, but I'm not really sure because I haven't ever tried it.

I think a lot of us remain skeptical partly because it rises meteorically and looks to head back to where it was. Aside from that, Ver has made himself appear a rather unsavoury leader, not least because he's made a few comments tantamount to proclaiming himself one.

Just one particular theory, no specific evidence behind it (unless they for some reason think Satoshi was Hal Finney); I didn't really mean to suggest I thought he was dead, more accentuate that there are a fair few potential reasons Satoshi won't ever mass dump his coins.

If I took out my profits now, I wouldn't consider myself rich at all. Sure if we all had something around 100k plus in BTC this would be great advice, but if your holdings are just a couple of years of relatively poorly paid wages then it probably doesn't feel remotely life-changing enough yet to cash some out.

I don't think you can chastise them too much for buying at an ATH, if you'd bought at quite a number of fairly absurd ATH prices you could've made a lot of money very quickly still. And if they'd tried to buy at any of these recent dips you could've still ended up significantly out of pocket too.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:38:48
Honestly, Wall Street might fuck about with the price quite a lot, but overall it's only a good thing for the reputation of bitcoin to the average Joe that they're getting involved. It's important to lend legitimacy to it for well-known companies, people, or whole sectors to get involved in it.

I used changelly a bit during the BCH pump and dump and paid for it (though not too badly admittedly). My thoughts after the few transactions I've made with them during a time of market volatility are that they are an absolutely farcical company that straight up lied to me on every transaction saying I would get the rate locked in at the time my own coins arrived at their address. I will never ever use them again.

To be honest if BTC actually did precipitate some sort of global economic crash because of those reasons it will have sort of accidentally put itself in an even better position. You talk as though the devaluation of the dollar is something crypto proponents are afraid of, when in fact that is something that is kinda part of the goal of crypto.

There are upgrades planned, ones that are a little different to the crude, though admittedly still very immediately effective, upgrades to block size people like Roger Ver champion. The 'Lightning Network' is the proposed solution for the 'real' bitcoin (the original chain, not bitcoin cash) which moves transactions off-chain, I'd recommend looking it up.
We are in a dangerous position because right now it's really the money and belief in the future of BTC which is holding us above other cryptos. I'm confident that the amount of money in BTC (and its fame) is more than powerful enough to see us through in the relatively short, even mid term, but its important the technology moves with the times fairly soon.
One thing I would point out to people worried is that once a major upgrade does happen we could see some really absurd growth, not necessarily a 'spike' but hopefully some steady, healthy growth, and perhaps see us taking a fair bit away from alts. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:02:32
I'm a relative newb myself, but I'd suggest potentially even investing in Eth for now if you're keen. It's definitely not 'too late', but BCH has BTC under pressure atm, and it'll be stressful to hold (unless you hold both perhaps). Eth might be good because you'd have your crypto-capital readily available to change into BTC when things settle down. If BTC really shoots up again past 7k or something then you'll know it's pretty safe, but for now there may be considerable pump and dumps by BCH at BTC's short-term (at least) expense.
It sounds cliche, but if BTC does recover fully then honestly the sky is probably the limit, and by that time you can never really have invested too early if you're planning on holding for a year or more (IMO, because crypto will be set to penetrate mainstream investment territory by then).

I'm not convinced there's been a significant 'correction' for quite some time. The only dips worth waiting for are caused by relatively large-scale potential crises, and the corrections seem to be the climb up following those rather than anything that takes us very far down. 
There have been great dips to buy at, and they have been *fairly* frequent, but I myself decided that it was almost riskier to wait for a dip than to just get in ASAP, and I'm happy with that choice.

Honestly I don't think BCH is an inherently illegitimate direction for a crypto to take, but Roger is not a good leader.

They may well make a move, though I doubt you'll be able to make as much profit as the last time even if they do.
They are not in a position to be slaying any dragons though with BTC at this market cap, but who knows what they will try and how far they will get. You can place your bet if you're trying to play the markets though of course, but I'm guessing most of us aren't likely to try.

I don't think there will be a significant drop, I think people are both assuming more people are looking to sell soon and also putting too much weight on particular milestones and psychological price barriers. I think too many people believe it will keep increasing for a mass sell-off, and as the market cap increases I also think it's getting less susceptible to downward swings because of sell-offs. Considering the amount of huge FUD-inducing events that bitcoin has survived this past year and bounced back from with great enthusiasm, I think FUD will start to become less and less effective too.
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:47:56
What are the chances he actually uses the attacks on BTC's value and pumping of BCH to simply acquire more BTC? And if that is his plan, do you think it's likely he's doing it because even he believes BTC is a better store of value, or that he hopes to keep accumulating until he can seriously fuck shit up with his BTC reserves?
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:11:13
It's not a ponzi scheme, though it should level off at some point in the relatively distant future and may even have a fairly significant dip when the room to grow halts enough. But because there is a limited supply, like gold, it shouldn't ever reach a point where it's continually dropping hard because of a lack of buyers. Some people will not be able to make significant profits by owning some, but it's not like once it stops rising massively its use cases are void.
Its development into an even more usable currency is the only thing worth worrying about, and honestly I think the influx of investment is going to easily keep it rising until the time that happens.

I think the general idea is that people believe BTC *will* solve it in due course, and that widespread use of bitcoin as a means for petty transactions is far enough away that it's acceptable for a solution to still be some time away as well.
There are also plenty of other coins that do that sort of thing better than both already, but bitcoin in particular fulfills the role of introducing people to cryptocurrencies and being a great store of wealth. That's why it's not urgent for BTC's survival to have the problem solved absolutely immediately.
BCH is more functional as a currency right now for sure, but as I said, if that was by far the most important thing in the short term then there are a host of other coins that would knock them off the top right now.
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:10:13
It's dipped/crashed a number of times already, probably will do again but not necessarily that soon, and not necessarily much lower than it is right now.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:24:44
Not entirely true, there are some advantages to the way BCH does things but they're nowhere near enough to offset the amount of money backing BTC and BTC has some exciting developments in the works to negate or perhaps even significantly better the advantages BCH currently has. There are also, IMO, a few coins which do what BCH tries to do differently to BTC, but better. BCH occupies a bit of a strange position I think.

This tends to be my view unless people are only in it for the very short-term. For long-term holders, or people who actually hope to switch to crypto as a permanent store of wealth/method of spending, then waiting for the dip isn't usually worth it because you're unlikely to time it particularly well anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:59:22
Thing is that all these major dips in the last year haven't really taken bitcoin that much lower than the previous pump. So if we think of 7.3k at the last genuine 'peak' of the last pump, the next dip may well not even go below that, in which case waiting for it as opposed to just getting some in at 8k seems hardly worth it.
@_date: 2017-11-25 03:01:29

@_date: 2017-11-24 06:54:02
My mind is at relative ease for a few reasons
1) The 'leaking' of stuff like this seems either a fake story, or a little desperate.
2) Though the financial power of BCH's supporters is impressive, they are massively overestimating it if they believe in a strategy like this.
3) Their massive pump to 2.8k or whatever it was seems potentially like it was their biggest chance to initiate a snap-'flippening', I think the BTC community feels much safer and much less susceptible to FOMO about BCH or FUD about BTC in this particular context.
BCH is a major nuisance but I honestly think BTC has both the moral highground and also the financial superiority if such a path is attempted again. BCH needs to drastically improve its reputation and/or have a *lot* more money that is willing to go all out on its side, and I don't think it's that close to getting either of those. I think they have to be careful with trying more pumps because I think they'll be decreasingly successful in terms of taking BTC's market cap, and it'll start to testify more to their own weakness than BTC's.
I would say they're better off trying to coexist, but then again I suppose that sorta sets them potentially on a path that inevitably leads to Bitcoin coming up with better fee solutions etc., by which point BCH probably will just fade into nothingness.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:25:03
There may well be a correction, but if you're thinking of 20% ones then it seems not toooo likely to me. There needs to be some bad news or coordinated attack on BTC's price for it to do so because generally speaking it is gaining momentum.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:14:26
I'm finding it really discouraging that both sides appear to be so disparaging to one another. I've chosen core BTC, but honestly a lot of what BCH users say, including Mr Ver, doesn't seem as bad as a lot of BTC holders have presented to me previously. I think both sides have their eyes on riches more than principles than they care to admit, but that whoever wins or loses neither was really attempting to scam; I think both genuinely believe their way is better, even if BCH may be slightly delusional (or perhaps it's us).
I wish I could have got into BTC earlier so I held all the forks already, but ah well. I hope BTC succeeds because my money is on the line and frankly that's starting to take over because I can't say with conviction which has the superior moral argument.
@_date: 2017-11-25 03:07:23

The problem is that BCH seems to be modelling itself as a Bitcoin killer, and I don't think it can do that, in which case I'm not sure how much of a future it has. 
Now seems like a pretty decent price to get for it, but if I had a load of free BCH then I might just keep it just in case it does something interesting in the next year. I honestly think it's fighting a losing battle, but there might be something to be said for having coins on both side of the battle in terms of your peace of mind.

I plan to use BTC as my main store of monetary wealth, thus I'm also hoping to be able to use it for more day-to-day transactions. Hopefully LN will make that more feasible, but I wouldn't mind just keeping BTC for larger purchases and using FIAT for buying food, drinks, and all those smaller, frequent buys.
Can't tell when I might cash out, it's a bit of a paradox because I don't wanna cash out until it reaches 100k or so, but I also think that by the time it reaches 100k it'll surely be widely accepted enough to not really need to cash out very much. I guess I would cash out a bit at 100k if it looked like it was going down a 'store of wealth' route rather than day-to-day currency route, but I'd still prefer to keep most of my savings in BTC than in a bank.

There's a lot of people that genuinely believe in it, no matter how delusional they might be. They have some valid points, and whichever side loses is gonna have a lot of fairly honest people massively out of pocket. 
It's a great shame, and maybe Ver and co. genuinely believe bitcoin core has taken an unjustified route of action, but the war they've started is going to burn so many people whatever the outcome, and I sorely wish bitcoin cash's leaders were advocates for coexistence, though I suppose if they were then their chain would probably fizzle out.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:53:06
The next significant dip is just as likely to be down to 10k from 12k as down to 8k from 10k I think. Honestly I think just buying in when you can is quite a good thing; it takes focus away from short-term gains and puts you in a great mindset for long-term holding. If BTC succeeds you will win big in the end anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:46:51
I ended up just going with localbitcoins in the end, a bank transfer to someone on that might seem scary, but if you don't mind a bit of a markup for some of the most reputable sellers you should be fine. Still best to buy in increments though, but watch out for doing it too quickly because banks sometimes stop transfers going through if they are repeated in short time frames because it can look accidental; once per day should be fine.
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:37:29
I think it will rise by between 4x and 7x in the next year. Larger market cap obviously means more money needs to be invested to make gains, but I think people will actually feel reassured by the fact there is such a lot of big money invested in it already; it will feel like security, which is more important for more measured investors rather than the crazy 'visionaries' or over-optimistic bandwagoners. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:28:00

Will you panic if it drops 10-20%?
If not, then you will be fine imo and even if you only held onto it for a few months you'd probably make impressive profits, but do as much research as you can :)
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:32:24
If you're serious about long-term holding then I'd fairly immediately put in a good portion of what you eventually want going into BTC. Getting in on the dip is brilliant but I think that the reason people should really invest significant sums in BTC is because they believe that each ATH will get smashed within relatively short time periods, so any time should hopefully still make you at least some money.
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:08:28
You're very welcome, and this is another very good question/point to bring up. Currently the smallest measured division of Bitcoins is a 'Satoshi', which isn't a separate currency or coin or anything, just what 0.00000001 Bitcoins would be called. There's currently about 10,000 Satoshi's per US dollar, so we don't really have a name for fraction of a Bitcoin which is particularly easy to think in for people who are used to dollars, pounds, euros etc.
I certainly think it would be helpful for a lot of cultures if BTC had more names for its various fractions, or perhaps even we just start calling what is 1 Bitcoin now a Giga-Bitcoin or something and named one of the smaller fractions as just 'A Bitcoin', but obviously until the price stablises those sort of divisions might just confuse things more over time.
It is genuinely possible that the ceiling for BTC eventually might even level out at a point where 1 Satoshi becomes only an order of magnitude of 10 or 100 away from a dollar/pound/euro, or (thinking wishfully) of the same order of magnitude as those currencies, which would be quite convenient.
Either way, eventually BTC certainly is designed to be used for more day-to-day use, and certainly the developers and/or community will come up with helpful names for various fractions of a Bitcoin as its value increases, and probably end up make it even more divisible.

Paypal isn't a currency or asset, it's just a way of sending currencies.

@_date: 2017-11-19 18:10:46
Having a high market cap is really important for bitcoin, it should help provide security and prevent large percentage downturns in value. The more it gets adopted, the safer it should become, which in turn will encourage more adoption from people who find the volatility off-putting.
Right now the potential for gains is absolutely out of this world, but a lot of investors or people who want to actual use it as a proper currency will be more interested when it's at a stage of steadier growth, even if that means less ROI.

IMO it's just a hilarious way to make it look like their failure to dethrone Bitcoin is all part of some master plan.

My thoughts (and the thoughts of many others) are that bitcoin could be seen as technically in a 'bubble' because right now investors are speculating on it's future value in the event of more widespread adoption of it. However, the value of bitcoin is still significantly lower than it would need to be to achieve certain levels of widespread adoption, and that is true even if thinking about usage many magnitudes lower than becoming a real go-to global currency, or even go-to store of wealth.
If the user base didn't grow from here, then it would be overvalued. But if the use base grows even at a relatively conservative rate, BTC's value will need to be much higher.

They neither have enough money nor a sound enough argument to achieve anything like that IMO. BCH pumps seem to be showing less affect on BTC, so I think they missed the boat if it ever was possible.
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:43:22
I would imagine that's part of the reason BCH's movement feels a little overly forced; the closer we get to LN on BTC, the closer BCH is to not having much less reason to be chosen over BTC. I wouldn't say LN is exactly imminent, but every day that goes by that BCH doesn't make big gains on BTC is a massive blow to it.

Safe but bad rates in my experience. It's a bit reductive, but I actually took the high rates to be evidence for its security so I bought a lot of my first crypto there, never had any problems myself.
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:05:38
Herehere, my hilarious first rookie error was trying to play the BCH pump and dump and pulling it off massively then sending a whole load of BCH to a BTC address :D

To be fair it looks like the gap between Korean exchange prices and the others has actually gotten smaller since that little dip.

You'd easily make profit if it got to 10k, assuming you use a decent exchange (ones like cex.io, whilst perfectly functional, mark the price up quite high).
Have a care though, you saying you only want to hold until the end of the year makes me feel like you quite need the money, in which case I don't know how well I'd recommend you do it.

A massive amount of conjecture, and I in no way think Roger Ver is a genuinely stupid person, but I think he's a lot less clever than he thinks, which is a very understandable thing to happen considering he made an unfathomable amount of money. I'm not sure he truly appreciates quite how much good fortune has accompanied his excellent initial foresight.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:49:56
Man it's even more annoying for people like me who hopped on the train pretty quick after learning about it properly because I *know* I would have invested at any time in the past year. Very happy with my gains though anyway, even if they are relatively paltry. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:45:10
The whole 'operation dragonslayer' nonsense is so hilarious; kind of like the stupidest clever way (if that makes sense) to stop BCH looking like is losing the fight once BTC approaches the 10k range.
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:22:54
I would buy more if it dropped to that, but unless some major scary news comes out then I really don't think investors just 'cashing out' is gonna be enough to even get it close to those levels. I'd be astounded if it went below 9k purely from people taking profits. BTC is gaining momentum, not tailing off.
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:08:09
My pretty much uninformed opinion is $35k-100k by the end of 2018. More a hope than an estimate, but any price outside that range would probably surprise me more than actually hitting that range.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:56:08
People are underestimating the momentum BTC is gaining I think, as how that balances with the increased market cap/coin value (i.e. doubling to 20k should be harder than doubling to 10k, but the investment should also increase exponentially).
I also think that BTC's 'dips' are less and less worrying situations for investors as there had been an increasingly large history of BTC bouncing back quickly from even major bad news, so any dip, be it a more natural correction or a FUDstorm should both be less worrying to holders and probably very inviting to people looking to invest more.
I don't think 15k by Christmas though, but I think it will hit it well within two months.

I'd recommend mining something like Vertcoin or ZCash if you have a decent GPU on any of those. You won't make much money, but from what I gather a $400 GPU could mine one of those and net you like a few dollars a day profit perhaps (including energy bills). Mining bitcoin would be a complete waste of time and money for you.
You don't need to buy a whole bitcoin though, you can buy it in incredibly small fractions. I would probably mine what you can with your hardware (as long as it's profitable) and put whatever spare cash you have into bitcoin.

It's not totally off the mark in some ways, but I think they're getting more confused between conscious market manipulation and reddit just being a generally potent and easily accessible source for FUD and FOMO to manifest for basically every crypto in existence. Singling out the bitcoin sub seems rather naive.
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:37:45
His point stands though :D
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:46:08
It's volatile because it is increasing in value rapidly, and unfortunately(?) it needs to increase in value in order for it to fulfill its function as a prime store of wealth and currency. 
If a government created their own Crypto for whatever reason and intended for it to even partially replace things like FIAT and gold, then they would either have to set the price at whatever people are willing to pay, and thus experience the growing phase BTC has done, or formally decide on a rough starting point of value (or even set value) and go from there.
But BTC aims to be decentralised and base its value purely on peer-to-peer transactions and what those peers value it as, so it has to naturally grow from its incredibly low starting price to the price it needs to be for however many people will eventually use it.
If BTC is on track to become a mainstay in the lives of even 10% of the world population (which would require BTC to be worth an absurd amount more than it is now), then it's not necessarily in a bubble, though it may be overvalued in the short-term by investors assuming a greater rate of adoption than we will have.

Well he has over 100btc, so I imagine he feels pretty safe financially. Also matesrates are surely a thing, depending on the level of friendship. And also it's probably quite easy to sell to someone you know privately, as well as avoiding any markdowns (if you use a shitty exchange that is).
@_date: 2017-10-15 20:03:51
Why then? The really big holders won't be holding in order to make some quick cash, they'll be holding to make sure they are part of the 0.000000001% (random small number) of biggest stake holders in a technology that should get exponentially more popular. It's really the people like me who are relatively small fry that are more happy to sell in order to pay my bills. To use a bit of a hyperbole-stereotype kinda thing: the financial elite don't want a tidy profit; they're after world domination.

If things are obviously improving over time, then time is very relevant.

I can only tell you what my general rule with Crypto is:
If you are considering taking out everything because the profits have got to an incredibly tasty point, then only take out half or the original investment (depending on the situation).
So I would take out half if I were you. It's guesswork I know, but I think this strategy will hopefully let you whittle down your debt and keep you well satisfied on that front, whilst also maintaining a collection of bitcoins which can start to look like an early retirement fund. Best of both worlds IMO.
