I imagine, there was an option somewhere, where you could link a namecoin-entry to your cryptic username. But i dont have Bitmessage at hand to test and be sure.

You celebrate cakeday on reddit without posting cake? Strange...
@_date: 2015-06-30 02:59:57
This seems legit. Thank you very much and have fun celebrating. *nomnom*

Conclusion: it is pretty risky to handle €.

As far as i understood it, this will not longer be a problem as soon as miners and pools start using the getblocktemplate-standart.
@_date: 2014-08-11 13:11:35
But then you still use a centralized DNS, even if you pay with bitcoin. And .bit is decentralized and imho pretty robust.

Put it on [betmoose]( and i will join the bet.

Sadly, you are even more than right. :-( If you put the success of manipulativ "news" over the years in a chart, it seems like we are always on ATH.
@_date: 2014-02-17 20:57:25
The blockchain doesnt grow exponentialy, imho.
@_date: 2014-06-30 17:34:10
Maybe he is still right. Maybe he just thought, 1 share of bitcoin equals less than around 1.6 million satoshi. As long as he doesnt define "his" share of bitcoin, he can be right forever.

If these journalists dont stop bothering D.S.N. i hope, S.N. will help him, to prove that !(D.S.N. == S.N.). He could for example wait, till D.S.N. is in an live interview and then post somewhere the live Questions of the interview and sign it with his keys.
These journalists really can be a pest. :-/

There will be something like "Casascius bitcuboids". And then some authority will come and say, that it is not legal to "mint" cuboids but nobody would care, because it is traded over Darkmarket. I cant wait to see that. :-D

to be fair, its needed to be said, that mt.gox is not a bank. so why do people use it as bank and store so many coins there? ( instead of just using it as exchange? and it is also well known, that goxs is having problems since more then a year. so if you know, that gox is gox, why you dont use an alternativ exchange? and much more: use the exchange as an exchange and not as your personal vault.

You need to put it on the moon, because he is heading in that direction and has probably not longer vision on lower clouds. Also, it has already been done, as seen [here](
@_date: 2014-05-21 21:11:26
I second this. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 17:02:54
It was advertised as free\*. So if you put every month plenty of these risky euros in that account it will become more free**.

Wouldnt it be possible, to simply add a field like "USER AGENT" (as seen on  with a donationadress? So it would be possible, to create a fund, that would be equaly spread amongst all online nodes with an active donation-adress and maybe some other criteria (like version must be newest) at for example every new block.  I would deffenetly use this feature on my nodes. But i also dont mind if dont get paid for it, because bitcoin itself pays me enough. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 21:55:36
I just added some ["WHEEEE"]( to this little guy.
@_date: 2015-05-28 21:30:49
As far as i know it is possible to forge a transaction, that uses multiple outputs. But i can only remember one wallet, that uses this feature. But in its case it is used for weakening cointracebillity. So one could possible do it without any redirection/resending.
@_date: 2014-05-22 17:33:07
wouldnt it be more easy for him to simply post the amount and paymentadress here?
@_date: 2016-11-24 16:57:30
So is it possible to set Druglord as occupation and international arms trafficking for source of funds? Or do i need to lie?

This title is very missleading to me. Thought, they where able to mine 13 blocks ahead. Wich would have been a great accomplishment in terms of showing weak points of this system. What really happend is, that they installed massiv hardware and found 13 blocks more then they expected to find in a certain timeframe.

Sometimes it takes some more time untill bets get gesolved and userbase is smal. But it worked fine for me.
@_date: 2015-04-15 21:51:51
Why spending them on $ if it is the only unit of account? need that paper to light a fire?
@_date: 2015-04-01 23:35:02
Only tl;dr: isn not smartphone + highspeed dataplan + youtubeish-services + changetip exactly this?
@_date: 2015-09-15 21:58:59
What are you doing/working on currently? Need help?
@_date: 2015-03-11 15:32:58
The time, this feature was new i had 5 to 10 trades in aproximatly 3 month. But last half year till now i had not a single one. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 14:11:30
If only someone could invent something like [BitID]( :-(
@_date: 2015-11-19 15:28:00
I thought *they* are monitoring things like sms and telephonecalls. But could not find some unencrypted sms-messages? Thats an evidence of incapacity of *their* current mass-surveillance-program. I demand a working on for unecrypted communication, before *they* evolve that one for encrypted communication.
@_date: 2015-03-10 17:42:38
Yeah. Now i have 300 bits and can run around tipping some folks. :-) Thank you 10 bits
@_date: 2015-03-10 17:31:06
Every bit counts... :-D
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:08:06
I need some bits to bid those bits for [bits](
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:24:58
Oh no!!! Silkroad down and owner in jail. Now i cant buy drugs online(what i anyway never did). But now me precious Bitcoins are all worthless. :-( I need to sell all asap. -.-
No, really. Why are people acting like this? Do they not understand the advandages of the protokol or are they just hopeing for a quick gain with sell-rebuy?
