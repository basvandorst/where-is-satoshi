Hi, 
you might want to consider posting something on r/hacking.

The honest answer is no one knows how low or how high bitcoin will go. It is one of those watch and see cases.

At the moment BTC has settled at $500ish mark, it will go up for a while, but then falls back and stay the between $500-600. Baring a P and D which will always effect the price. Once all the hype over BTC is done and gone the end price will be ??? well no really knows, all we can do is speculate. And I mean NO ONE KNOWS.
Expensive is relative to how much cash you can afford to spend and possibly lose.
The more BTC becomes intergrated into normal society so the price will fall, at the moment BTC is still enjoying its novelty factor, one which over time it will shake off.
However, this depends on the take up rate of merchants around the world.
Is BTC a good invest ment for $500 plus ?
Again, no one can say a definate answer.
You pays your money and you takes your chances.

Please read the side panel of information on how to get started
@_date: 2014-05-17 19:27:25
ok, once you have opened synaptic, look at the top and next to quick filter Search you should see a space in which you can type qt4

Yes bitcoin is here to stay, the price will fluctuate for some to come and as more and more retail outlets accept bitcoin so the price will fall.
Effectively bitcoin is losing its novelty factor the more it becomes mainstream.
Also alot of people jumped on the bandwagon at the $1000 and beginning to see the error of their ways and selling up to the nearest price they can get, this coupled with the various exchanges going under and China throwing its toys out its pram, are all leading to a decline in the price.
Bitcoin is going to be around, but what value No one knows its a very impressionable virtual currncy that is beginning to grow up and stand on its own two (at the moment) very shaky feet.

Deflation does not increase everyones buying power, Deflation if you have any kind of loan, means that the loan ends up costing you more money to repay, there fore diminishing you spending power.
The grandmas and grandpas of 20 years time, have loans and mortgages and lots of debts to service so they simply do not have the disposable income to GAMBLE with.
"100% savings" what savings at 0.5% insterest.What ever saving people have often go set up their offspring in a property or a marriage.
The majority of society either hasnt got the money to GAMBLE with bitcoin or what money they do have is tied up elsewhere that gives them a better reteurn both in the meduim and long term.
Bitcoin is still a big gamble and will be until it stabilises in the mainstream of commerce, therefore, people are still very wary of this gamble and a gamble is what it is.... and no one should gamble with money that they cannot afford to lose.
I like your thinking but it is very simplistic :)
@_date: 2015-01-20 15:46:34
Convert to bitcoins.
 But only if you can afford to lose the money.....
@_date: 2017-01-09 11:15:00
