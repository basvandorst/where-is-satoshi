Can BTC please just bottom out. This roller coaster game has gone on all year. Hell i would be thankful for a month of sideways movement at this point. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 12:49:35
inside information?
@_date: 2018-09-18 12:35:31
sadly no. i am just running out of fiat to accumulate anymore.  
@_date: 2018-09-05 18:43:29
The amount of market manipulation and whales can drive a man/gal mad. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 18:16:56
Can we just bottom out already. Bring that 4800-5000 BTC so we can move back up. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 15:16:34
There are small groups of people who own majority of coins or massive positions. I think they even have a term like "dark pools" or something like that. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 15:14:07
Hopefully we can drop off about 1300 coins. I'm okay with a few hundred 
@_date: 2018-08-08 15:25:58
probably more than one

FF potions for the win. Keep them for a boss fight and never use them the whole game. Happens every time.

the manipulation is so bad that new investors are just turning away. we need growth and with the bs manipulation that i have dealt with the last year is ridiculous. 
@_date: 2019-03-14 17:56:55
i like the optimism (:
@_date: 2019-03-11 13:45:36
i lost more money on stocks than i have in crypto by about a 3:1 ratio in terms of USD. If you think crypto is manipulated, i feel like the stock exchanges are much worse. personal opinion. Maybe i am just bad with real stocks, however its sad i can make so much more in something so new and volatile as crypto. Been trading 3 years now.

I have the nano ledger i just hate whipping it out for trades since i keep it under lock and key. Only money i have on any exchange is binance and it isn't much less than 15% total portfolio. Mostly for trading when i'm bored. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 13:45:08
careful i said the same thing and got downvoted hardcore. 
@_date: 2019-03-25 16:38:32
Down again we go so the manipulators can make more money off of the sellers. It is a never ending cycle. 
@_date: 2018-10-12 17:04:50
For the past few months all i've heard from my avid BTC friends is that 5600 was the bottom and if it broke we could see 4k BTC. I honestly don't know what to believe, i just keep buying the dips.
@_date: 2019-03-14 13:47:41
is it the 4200 level we need to break in order to get upward momentum ?
@_date: 2018-10-01 15:07:25
so be it. the lower it goes the more i accumulate. No need to rush  
@_date: 2019-03-11 13:04:34
well we didn't break 4200 so i guess that means i keep buying cheap. I'm addicted to accumulation 
@_date: 2019-03-18 12:57:23
we have to see 3200 again to hit true bottom officially or break 6k for a bull run. Anything in between that is pretty much bull traps and shorters making so much money off your sells, buying low, raising the price back up with all the extra money they made and rinse and repeat.  
@_date: 2019-10-11 18:52:22
You probably aren't wrong but i like to diversify if it is only 30%. However this 30% hurts a lot lol
@_date: 2019-10-28 19:49:11
Dems bud the dems
@_date: 2019-10-11 18:16:13
Man im 70/30 BTC/Alts and my alts have been decimated holy shittttttttttt
@_date: 2019-10-28 19:50:45
gamers ? The people who support micro transactions and are the cause of Paid DLC and the lack of companies caring about the players ? Yeah F that.
@_date: 2019-02-18 16:23:14
It is sad you have to come to Reddit to act like a child. Grow up. Most people would take thick as a compliment these days. People who use "think" to describe someone's ability to entertain others opinions are invariably ignorant fucks.  
@_date: 2019-02-18 16:01:19
well if you listen to everyone who says "bull run" when it increases by .05% then you are just not very bright. Until BTC hits like 2200 or what not it is very unlikely we will have a real bull run like we did at the end of 2017. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 16:04:24
ATH? Are you serious. I wish i had even a little of this optimism (more like wishful thinking)
@_date: 2019-04-26 17:50:07
Everyone who contributed to the increase in BTC market dominance is part of the problem. Because of you guys the whales just got fatter. They played all of you like fiddles to gain more market control.
@_date: 2018-11-13 15:56:58
I'm so ready for this years run if it comes, if not i will just continue to accumulate.  
@_date: 2019-05-14 16:20:32
You're a dumb ass OP. Trumps the only reason we can even still buy BTC freely or have the extra cash to do so. IDC what anyone has to say about it. we needed orange man so bad. I have so much extra money to throw into crypto since that man took office. Also keep politics out of these threads. I have been enjoying crypo for nearly 3 1/2 years now without this type of bs. Keep it that way
