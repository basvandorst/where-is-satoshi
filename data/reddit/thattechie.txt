Can I have your banking info? I’ll deposit $50 weekly. Just need account number, password, last four of SSN, your first pets name, and your mothers maiden  name 
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:15:55
It’s only losing if they don’t agree to split 50% of their profits or one of them skips their $50 for that week.

Are you open to helping families in need? Literally struggling to get food and water right now
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:03:52
What do you mean 5 minute red candle?
Also I love my job, I’m just saying it’s kinda weird that I can make more money through bitcoin than my job. Part of the reason being I’m also in school currently. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:59:56
Same shit
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:02:22
But the coins are. They don’t just disappear from the internet until you use them. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:22:39
My idea would be to tell them you only know the first 6 words, and three other people know 6 words each, so you can give them the code without those three people
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:13:01
It’s online whether paper, hardware, or exchange. Only difference is on paper/hardware the exchange can’t just disappear and say “oops site shut down, 24 hours to remove all funds or they’re ours”

Written contract. 
“I X agree with Y, and Y agrees with X that we will each put $50 into this coinbase account. And if at any time either X or Y decides he wants his money out, both X and Y will transfer their portion (50%) to a different bitcoin address, or sell 50% for fiat. 
Sign x ________
Sign y ________”

Just hodl on!

Edit:why wouldn’t you use rails if you’re that concerned?
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:57:59
If it’s at $100 and goes to $200 that’s a 100% increase and doubles the value by gaining $100
If it’s at $1,000 and goes to $1,100 that’s only 10%
So assume you’re holding $100
One rise gets you $100 extra, the other gets you $10 extra. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:52:15
Oh it doesn’t worry me at all, I just wished I could’ve bought right as it dipped that $50 so I could get a few extra dollars from it
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:39:35
I’d prepare for around 7,000 but it’ll spring up within n a day or two 
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:20:28
And lack of miners due to new forks and altcoins. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:55:56
Do I matter?
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:29:42
Not that slow, I was able to get bitcoin immediately on coinbase, and then transfer over to Blockchain all within 15 minutes 
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:27:44
I’ll buy it for $20, and try to brute force it
If successful I want 5btc and you can have the rest
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:35:15
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:45:48
Not saying I don’t have an issue with it, but miners deserve it. 
Supply and demand. Not enough miners in supply so there’s a demand for high fees
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:29:15
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:37:44
Nah I’ve held for a bit over two months
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:41:48
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:33:07
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:17:47
Looks great but what is the meaning? It “holds” the caps? The holder grows?
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:27:19
Like the other guy said, credit cards are 3%, plus bitcoin isn’t even ready for day to day transactions which is why it’s so high, if/when bitcoin becomes a day to day thing it’ll probably be a few cents, if that
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:39:19
Technically yes there is infinite bitcoin. It is infinitely divisible. 
Today .01 bitcoin could be $100, the years from now .001 could be worth $100 and then .00000000001
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:07:02
How much? Can you go first if I give you all the card numbers except the last 3 and then once I receive it I can give you the last numbers
Edit: $115.54
@_date: 2017-10-17 04:08:09
How old are they? I don’t know many people my age interested in it either, I think it really hit me because I’m a technology nerd, and have been able to see bitcoin grow from when it was 1600 to what it is now, which really made me decide I should start putting some money into it
@_date: 2017-10-16 23:45:54
I checked and apparently july 25, which was around when I first got the app so I assumed it was the same, but didn’t think to check again
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:26:31
If it allows double the capacity and transactions doesn’t that mean they have the opportunity to get two times the fees?
@_date: 2017-10-17 03:39:14
Holy shit thank you so much! PM’ing now!
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:28:29
What subreddits?
Also I’d be willing to do a trade either through escrow, or the person I’m trading with could send like $10 bitcoin as a down payment, then I send the gift card numbers, then they said the remaining 74
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:20:31
I would say it classifies as property since the price isn’t consistent, it could go down to be $0 one day, and they can’t consider something worth $0 money
Maybe they could classify it as money since it’s called a bitCOIN though, I’d ask a lawyer but I don’t see why you wouldn’t be able to use bitcoin just because you’re in finances
@_date: 2017-10-09 04:01:00
Idk dude I thought they looked awesome
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:29:44
Ok, I just made an account on bitrated. Same as my Reddit username. 
If you start the trade I’ll except. How much are we doing? 
0.0242257 btc?
@_date: 2017-10-09 03:57:57
Same shit
@_date: 2017-10-17 03:22:37
Haha! I’ve learned some with precious metals (silver and copper, even though copper isn’t really rare)
Now I decided I’d try to learn and maybe make some money off of bitcoin. I would try other altcoins but at this time there’s no point, if big companies and governments are going to pick up a crypto, it’s going to be the most successful and established one, which is bitcoin. 
I do think it might be in a mini bubble as people are speculating though, $1000 rise in less than a day is too much to be considered stable in my book, at least for now
@_date: 2017-10-17 04:11:06
Wouldn’t blockchain be better? Because blockchain is held on blockchain servers and can be recovered, if my hard drive fails or my OS becomes corrupted I can’t recover bitcoin from electrum wallet can I?
Yeah I’m definitely going to hold, unless bitcoin starts to drop dramatically, then I’ll sell when it starts to drop, and once it reaches a low point I’ll buy back
@_date: 2017-10-30 11:28:43
There’s bitcoin discounts? Sorry, new to bitcoin, only held some for a few weeks now
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:24:40
Thanks, I just need to know what platform you’re on, and your login/password and 1.3059200 Btc will be sent your way
@_date: 2017-10-17 21:25:25
Confirmed. Thank you so much! I’m at work now so can’t type much but will pm you in a few hours
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:39:55
No they don’t. They know if they get caught with a single bill they can get fucked in the ass
