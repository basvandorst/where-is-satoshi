They'll be saying this about cars once they're all driverless. The NSA will want to know where all cars are travelling when all driving is automated.

No doubt it's mostly game theoretic in nature at the moment. But I still believe a technical solution is possible. We found a way to broadcast knowledge about all Bitcoin transactions without issue, via the blockchain. Something tells me we integrate knowledge about pools into the protocol to help mitigate that risk as well.


The real issue is not they will be irrational, but they will act rationally but against the future of Bitcoin, possibly with a large enough bribe. The current system make work well for decades, but if Bitcoin becomes a widely used currency, there will be manipulators who want to deliberate affect it's value for their own personal gain.
In my mind, centralization is a hard problem because wealth naturally collects, as many have shown in the Pareto distribution. Even if we could somehow change pools, we may run into other types of centralization. Who knows? But simply labelling it as a "political issue" and walking away isn't the solution, for me personally.

There was another post in that suggested that a big hashing pool could be bribed by a government to bring down Bitcoin. I'm not saying it's going to happen soon, but we shouldn't ignore problems like this. We should be proactively working to prevent them.

Nah, I didn't find that feature until I specifically looked for it. Thanks for pointing that out!

It's entirely possible they were using the Android app.

Honestly, I don't see banks becoming completely obsolete if Bitcoin going mainstream. Some of them will welcome Bitcoin and become more popular because of it. The rest will wither away.
I could see Bank of America becoming such a bank, as they've already made an official on the value of the currency (despite being extremely low).

Can't tell if sarcastic..
I'm genuinely interested in fixing hard problems.

I've been waiting to verify my account for a while. I haven't gotten any response since August.

I'm not saying we do away with hashing pools. I'm saying we find a way to incorporate them into the protocol, thus making them managable.

I haven't spent enough time to understand offline wallets enough to know what the best practices are. Not something I want to dive into over a weekend.

Code has a high barrier for entry. I was expecting a real Bitcoin expert to swoop down and explain why my idea was bullshit. But instead I just get responses like this.
@_date: 2014-01-30 05:13:25
Can we get more context? Was this from a video?

Unless they have investments elsewhere.

As soon as governments see something successful, they find a way to control it. $4 billion market cap isn't shit. Wait until we hit $100 billion market cap. Watch how hard they'll work to capture Bitcoins.

Whoops, should have been hoard, not horde.

As far as I know, no other digital currency has made it as far as Bitcoin, in terms of trust. This hypothetical is based on Bitcoin becoming as valuable as gold, hence the usage of the word gold in my title.

It won't ever be "protected" in the sense that some guardian will come down from the sky and prevent all the baddies from looking at our chat history. We need better crypto tools to deal with the influx of government power on the 'net.
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:22:23
Perhaps I'm not making my worry clear enough.
I worry that no matter how many times we divide Bitcoin into smaller units, governments can just collect or seize more and more of them and hold them securely with human resources a fraction of those necessary for gold.
@_date: 2013-12-28 15:27:43
I wish there was more discussion about what networking and crypto primitives Bitcoin uses. While it's made an impact so far, we're still a long ways away from what distributed, secure networks could do for society.
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:09:17
Wouldn't that hurt it's liquidity at all? I'm sure there are plenty on this forum who got in early and mined or bought tons of coins, but the vast majority have not.
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:57:46
I'm talking about government**s**, not just the U.S.A.
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:30:53
They won't ban Bitcoin no more than they've banned Google. They'll just have complete control over it by seizing as much as they can via drugs, controlling the Bitcoin mining companies.
We won't see these things happening until Bitcoin hits $100 billion or more market cap. Right now Bitcoin is not much of a threat.

To be honest, I don't know enough about Merkle trees to be able to download pieces of a file from multiple peers and combine them to reconstruct the entire file.
While Merkle trees are not networking per-se, they are an important primitive in creating distributed networks:

Errm.. I mean, the larger market cap will encourage them to be more aggressive.
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:17:21
I guess I'm imagining a scenario where governments, over several decades, hold 90% of all bitcoin in reserve, causing even those units to look rather small.
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:58:05
They probably are. That's why I raised the question.
