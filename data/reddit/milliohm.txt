what if he had used a bitcoin ATM? What then? :D

try losing your private keys

Heheh I know right? Finally I can afford something good

I agree that too much inflation is not a good thing, but my point is that our current Economy system is based off human nature and that our nature doesn't fit very well with a deflationary system. Nobody would never lend money, never spend, productivity will fall... and so on.. not sure how to go about this

Just paraphrasing GoT. A good reminder to address the new coin as Bcash.
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:45:45
Don't. If you read about it online you'll quickly discover that cloud mining doesn't work.

yes it is. there are 0day exploits sold for iOS sold in the range of millions of dollars. that means that there are ways to access your iPhone and steal your wallet keys, but the high price of this exploits also indicates that only few peopl have them and they are usually used to spy on relevant politicians.

I was expecting "Facebook" at the end.
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:44:55
yes, I have done the same with one friend of mine! no problem at all
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:48:23
Android if you don't pay attention is not very safe. there are thousands of spyware apps: 
iOS is safe but still pay attention, don't jailbreak it, update it and you'll be more or less fine.

I know right? Brilliant

Found it here -&gt;

True. But it’s just a copy paste from below in the chat. I wrote it too late ��
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:17:56
was there another post on this? apologies, I just got a little alarmed and wanted some confirmation.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:29:27
without mentioning the fact that has no idea about basic math. Quoting: "from 6000 bitcoin went to 9000 giving me 30% extra." It's 50%. Why are we even wasting time on this idiot.

I am not really clear on the below part. How can bot Bitcoin and Bitcoin2X die?
"A complicating factor is the existence of Bitcoin Cash, a fork of Bitcoin which shares the same PoW but has in addition an improved DAA that ensures it can adjust downward in difficulty rapidly as needed in the event of miner evacuation, keeping its block interval at approximately 10 minutes on average. Bitcoin Cash cannot die, but Segwit1x and Segwit2x can both die."

Would this run with raspberry 2?
@_date: 2017-04-28 18:19:32
Amen, brother
@_date: 2018-11-05 09:19:35
he'll probably die first of age

I love this ending from the original article from Lucid!
@_date: 2017-09-29 06:07:32
I understand the dedication that one can have for Bitcoin, but spending and rebuying its not t that good since the bitcoin I spent was definitely bought at a cheaper price. I get it that you can sacrifice some of those gains for the Better good but from an economical perspective it’s not very wise. That’s all

ehm... to my knowledge HODL became a meme after the guy that wrote the post below mispelled it: 
I saw the acronym too but that came later, invented by some creative mind. So dude, you should know better ;)

check this out. with 100 USD in tech you can run a full node from your home. If you want to be extra careful you could use a VPN or TOR, but I don't think it's going to be a problem. Also, I think 200GB is only for the first download. hten it's definitely less than that.

fake or not, the funny thing is that with a single photo he can beg worldwide
@_date: 2017-05-20 21:10:23
it's not about intimidation, it's about moving forward. We are in a stalemate position and other cryptocurrencies are eroding the market.  The "flippening" might seem unlikely but if we remain a stagnant solution because of our internal fights, money and people will move to something more resilient. Bitcoin can leverage the fact that came first and keep moving, or stagnate and be the error that other players will learn from. I'd rather be the first one.
@_date: 2017-05-22 08:34:49
if you account the inflation, probably not so long ;)
@_date: 2017-05-21 11:29:02
It's a self fulfilling prophecy :)
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:42:56
It seems pretty official to me since it's the repository since forever.. can you argument?
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:05:45
How exactly do I do that? :) I am running "version": 140000
How do I update without reinstalling the whole thing?
@_date: 2017-07-19 19:22:01
no probs. keep it running for now :)
@_date: 2017-07-20 06:00:19
Wtf are you blabbering about. I am running a full node with bip148. Wtf is a shillcoiner?
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:54:57
but despite that, my point was that we are losing the repo where all the good devs are pushing changes for some other repository where those devs have no access... If we don't need to run the nodes with the Segwit2x software and we can continue using what we have now the nwe are fine. But if not we are kinda screwed..
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:44:56
agreed but as a matter of fact that's what's happening...
@_date: 2018-12-23 16:53:49
I’m a dev. Projects like that gets me going.......
@_date: 2018-12-23 16:53:13
I’m not trying to convert him. He’s an adult and can think with his mind. I just wanted to get some input on if I’m missing anything important. But hey this is reddit and it’s full of acid people
@_date: 2018-12-23 15:04:34
good points. not trying much to convince him. just added few points that are important to me!
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:48:12
I see, so even if the Segwit2X passes and locks within August 1st, it doesn't mean that nodes need to run their code...
