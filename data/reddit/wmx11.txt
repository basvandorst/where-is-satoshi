I hope people will notice this and won't buy into the centralized whale coins.

It's an Alternative McAfee Coin.

On the other hand, Reddit is the place where you can find some good news, aaaand some really, really weird s...t, lol. Let's use Bitcoin to pay the good content creators!

TRON proposed a whitepaper internet, this dude proposes a new internet where crypto will rule! But really, I hope it's not TRON he's talking about. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 19:27:50
Huh, so this most likely is going to the downvote hell, lol. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 19:20:59
That's an interesting take on this, lol.
Can't really tell if he's autistic or not. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 21:28:40
This should be upvoted, lol.

Not yet, but keep them memes ready for another 9k breakout.

Well, they made an official announcement that they will be releasing a crypto tied to the value of USD. But you will be able to pay for trivial things, which a credit or debit card is sufficient enough to do.

A US Dollar with some fancy buzzwords like blockchain and crypto attached to it, lol 
@_date: 2018-05-16 20:59:58
Check the references at the bottom of the article. Not a joke. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 12:38:16
Well, if SK accepts the regulations, then it might be. People might look at Bitcoin in a different way, perhaps. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 07:57:05
Bringing cryptocurrency adoption to the highest point in the world \- they sure are going to be remembered for this stupid PR stunt. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 14:47:35
Ah, there was this meme where cryptos were in a museum taking pictures of  Skeleteal USD, Pound, Euro dinosaurs. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 20:24:37
A pretty paranoid one? 
@_date: 2018-06-23 19:50:12
I'll just take some bath salts to avoid the date!

The funny thing is that good things attract people who are furious about it or just straight out hate it.

Well, it's the total amount that was tried to be stolen -  24,984 ETH +  230 million NPXS +  2.5 million BNT = $23.5 million.
Luckily, the BNT tokens were frozen so the thief only got the Ethereum and NPXS tokens, which is $13 million. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 15:02:04
The numbers would be insane. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:48:49
I've seen some discussions on twitter about Bitcoin dominance percentage. Do you really look at the dominance numbers? Or do you think it's not that informative? To me it says that more and more money is flowing into Bitcoin (If the dominance is going up), which eventually bleeds out to altcoins. 
@_date: 2018-07-10 06:30:00
Yup, looks like $12-13 billion vanished from the market cap in  around 8 hours
@_date: 2018-07-24 15:25:16
Totally agree. Well, if this bullish trend continues, we are probably going to see positive news headlines and more rookies. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:58:50
Can you buy groceries with a bag of grain? Perhaps. Bitcoin is no different - some places accept it!
@_date: 2018-07-24 18:01:05
meh, whatever you call them - still coins, lol. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:15:47
That's a rather interesting idea. Though it feels like it's something similar to discount cards or coupons for "loyalty".
