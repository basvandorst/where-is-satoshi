I can personally vouch for Coinbase as it has been a pleasant experience for me and the fees might be higher than others but the convenience and lack of problems to me will keep me coming back.

I believe it is also more for those who might not know about Gyft that they can become familiar with Bitcoin.

I had already purchased it before I knew of the discount code. I am still happy with the purchase so I don't mind paying the full price.

I am definitely going to try the sampler. I know of a certain friend who is a salt fiend which I think he will like this.

Thank you for providing your experience thus far with bitcoin taxes. I will need to become familiar with this for next tax season.

I can agree this was a great purchase with my Bitcoin.

This is my thought as well and only what I currently do.

I have been interested in purchasing one of these for awhile now and after reading this thread decided to take the plunge. I need some swag to bring with me when I meet with people at the local starbucks for localbitcoin exchange.

This is truly amazing I can't wait to show this to local merchants in my area.

It is great to see more store owners testing out bitcoin. As more start to do it I believe you will get some people interested in buying with bitcoin. Good luck.
