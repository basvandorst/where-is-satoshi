Links to impostors?

This is why you don't talk to reporters.

I would be interested in hearing what the Bitcoin community thinks is lacking in the current videos.  
@_date: 2014-07-15 20:05:22
I'm not as opposed to the idea as I once was. 
I think I would want input from the community about what they feel other videos have been lacking.

There is a non-zero chance that a bit coin will be lost in any time frame.  Since there is a hard limit on the total number of bitcoins there will eventually be no bitcoins.

Any chance of an webpage version like  ?  It's what I use on [my site](
@_date: 2011-05-21 21:45:26
Seconded.

10 nanocoins.

Complete agreement about none.  A lot of people could be put off the merits of the project when they see it connected with a group they don't agree with.

Why do you leave a little 'hat' of hair on his head?
@_date: 2013-07-31 22:06:00
Thank you.
I don't think I could do anything better [than this](  But there is a small chance I might have an opportunity to talk about Bitcoin a bit on a (distant) future project.

This argument is separate from the currency the site uses.

I pretty much wrote this article as a response to the surprisingly positive response to [this article]( in [this thread]( yesterday.  
@_date: 2013-07-31 21:38:32
I like using Bitcoins when I'm talking about currency in general rather than a particular currency.

Basically no one understands how government money works and it's doing just fine. Trust does not require understanding.

I'd be much happier if Bitcoin was associated in the press with pornography.  While porn is still an unsavory industry to the general public, at least it's legal and [has a lobby](

Also from the advertising fairy -- though the resolution may be too small to tell.  
@_date: 2013-08-15 02:16:51
That is some terrible PR for BitCoin. If he loves the currency so much he should not talk about it. 
@_date: 2013-08-15 22:15:49


My hope for Bitcoin is that it grows large enough to be used by normal people.  If it is associated only with shady websites and banned by governments it might take a decade or more to be useful to more than just a handful of geeks.  
@_date: 2013-08-01 11:15:01


lol yeah right.  The TL;DR is that in its current embryonic form Bitcoin is way, *way* too complicated for normal people to use and people don't like complicated things.  
@_date: 2013-07-31 21:37:47
Yup, that's me: 1D8yKvNVdmj9huWdazb3Adx9pGBDhxmjJN
Thanks to everyone who has help via Bitcoin.  We're having some problems with Amazon right now (which shows the need for some form of digital currency to succeed)

Thank you!
