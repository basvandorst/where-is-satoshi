I'm glad things have calmed down, and somewhat hoping for more red days.. because the hodler of last resort moment feels like it's approaching.

When the power goes out GLOBALLY? In every single country of the world simultaneously?

The amount of people who don't understand this concept is enormous.

Difference is, your dream is more likely.

Good thing I bought AMZN  and AMD today then.

I think the truth is a lot more awesome than that... What if everyone, is gambling only what they are willing to lose, playing this game of musical chairs with a cryptoasset that increases in value because of the hodler of  last resort?
I know I put like 5, 10% of my paycheck into limit orders below the price, how many others like me are there? probably more than dozens. 
This 6k range is awesome. If 4k could come, and even 3k.. wow.. But nobody shorts bitcoin long term. The musical chair game is to find the hodler of last resort.

I mean I'm not disagreeing with you but social networks are calling themselves platforms rather than publishers to skirt around legal issues. 
And they are skirting around legal issues, so although you may call them a publisher that doesn't mean the government does, so this point is irrelevant.

yeah there will always be more fiat
@_date: 2018-10-27 04:33:51
Where are your limit orders at?
I gots the 2500 - 4200 range

Feels bad man.. I respect the big hombres out there with massive balls to do shit on margin.
I'm a simple man, I buy red sell green. The goal is always to acquire more btc.

The internet is too, and also \* shudders intensify\* the REAL WORLD!
Why does it matter that there are bad things on the internet? There's bad things everywhere.

Yes audio of the call is stored on a data server in Utah or somewhere like that. Snowden showed us all this years ago.

First off, twitter is a private company, they can do whatever they want. 
If conservatives were smart enough to code they'd come up with a better social media company. 
Y'all acting like Twitter is paid for by your taxes like the DMV. smh

I have limit orders between 3.8k all the way up to 5.3k. 
That crazy of a drop might never happen but DCA while sleeping is the way to go.
