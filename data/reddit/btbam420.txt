Yesterday we were waiting on the developers to give the OK to do manual payments.  Have they decided its OK for them to give us our money yet? Or will that decision take another day or two...
Update: Order finally processed

I attempted to withdraw 700 USD from Gox to my checking account about 4 weeks ago.  I emailed support after 3 weeks and have not heard a response yet.  Previously support had always responded within 3 business days. (Verified account)
Edit: Still don't have my cash, still haven't heard a response from support (submitted 3 tickets now, anyone know a phone number to try?)

Just so you know it seems like that site is not working anymore.  You click post a public question or view Q&amp;A and it doesn't display.  Also, you guys should really put a notice up on the front page explaining what's going on with everyone's orders and your timeline for resolution.  This is my first experience using your service, and so far I'm on the fence with how this problem is being handled. 
If you guys can't process my order, can you at least refund my cash?
Edit: My order processed, the delay was unpleasant, but I am just glad everything worked out in the end.  I will try again with you guys in the future.

If you go to the support page, they also removed all the posts talking about how people aren't receiving their bit coins.  So there's no way for users to know before they're trapped in limbo like the rest of us.
