As a developer I am saying that this is total bulls*it!

$3000.00/Thash seems fair to me

The account was 2 years old with 48 positive feedback. What proof do you require?

This is my biggest question. I've contacted eBay and I will post their answer as soon as I receive an answer from them.

All payments were taken via PayPal. Happy that I've withdrawn all the funds.

And this is the response I got from eBay:
Hi! Greetings!
Thanks for contacting eBay Customer Service about your concern. I personally like how much effort you've put into this. And I am encouraged that we will be helping you as our trading partner. My name is Cindy, I’d be glad to assist you further. Please know that we are working to resolve this as quickly as possible.
I know how important it is for you to use your account and you been a valued member since 2009. We appreciate your effort for contacting us to have this issue resolved. Allow me to further explain to you on why your account got suspended.
Your account was suspended because it exhibits a risk to eBay and to its community. As eBay is an internet-based business, and its members are our customers, we have to carefully weigh the risks involved with allowing users on our site. From time to time, we find accounts which have a risk that no longer justifies a continuing relationship with eBay. When that happens we suspend these accounts and they are no longer able to be used for buying or selling.
We have determined that it is in our mutual best interest to part ways. We regret any frustration or inconvenience this matter may cause you.
For your account there is no appeal for this decision. From this point forward, in order to conduct business on the internet, you will have to find a different venue.
I hope this information helps. I wish you all the best in your future eBay transaction.
We truly appreciate that you made eBay as your avenue for your buying activities! Thank you for choosing eBay as one of your online market place. We value your business!
Take care!
