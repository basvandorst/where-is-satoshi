Why no ADA?

In all seriousness, this can’t be higher than middle school math

You go from planet to galaxy when we've only colonized Mars. The universe is bigger than you think my friend.

you waste your time doing that? You could spend your time easily making more money, and then just buy bitcoin with that money.

This must be fake, there is no way anyone in the crypto space could seriously fall for scams like this. And if you really did fall for it, maybe crypto isn’t really your thing.

What makes bitcoin cash a scam? I’m genuinely trying to understand why people think it’s a scam.
@_date: 2019-05-21 02:02:40
Why can’t bitcoin be attacked? Just because there are a lot more people mining it so no one entity could actually pull off an attack?
@_date: 2019-05-21 02:14:17
Glad you took the time to ridicule me rather than just tell me
@_date: 2019-05-21 02:04:02
What makes it decentralized? Too much mining power for any one person to attack it?
@_date: 2019-05-21 03:42:39
Thanks for all the info! That is super helpful!
