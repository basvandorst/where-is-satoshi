Simply download Bitcoin Core from  open the wallet file, and export the private key(s) (*dumpprivkey* in the Help -&gt; debug console). It doesn't need to sync the whole chain because at that point you can just import them into the electrum wallet. Remember you *can* have multiple privatekeys in a wallet, but typically you only have one.

This is waaaayyy overblown. Write a check, get a bank cashier's check, or use cash notes.

Incredible news. Eventually we should be able to transact over lightning network and settle in BTC, LTC, ZEC, XMR, XLM, Dash, DOGE, and any other currencies that can run on lightning network (ETH?). The interoperability will be great for all these currencies. There are 168 fiat currencies, so there's plenty of room for multiple crypto currencies to co-exist and bolster each other via lightning.

Store value in Bitcoin. Use Wasabi wallet. Improve Bitcoin. Get Schnorr signatures.  confidential transactions on liquid sidechain: 
Atomic swap to Beam/Grin for spending. At that point it's moot if Bitcoin adds fungibility (it may or may not be possible to achieve consensus). Beam core wallet will support full Bitcoin functionality soon with built in atomic-swap and decentralized marketplace for BTC &lt;-&gt; Beam.
Bitcoin for large payments and store of value. Other coins for mid-small payments. Lightning in progress to also run on top of Beam/Grin.
Hopefully also Bitcoin adds more fungibility in the long run.

Puerto Rico is a commonwealth of the United States. You still remain an American citizen there as it is a territory of the United States (just is not a state). You pay between 5% to 10% capital gains for property acquired before moving to Puerto Rico and 0% for property acquired after.

**Physically delivered bitcoin. Cold wallets that are insured with a $100,000,000 policy underwritten by leading global insurance carriers. Geographically-distributed storage of private keys secured by the bank.**

XLM tried this before by giving away free XLM to BTC holders--but you had to register with Facebook and your BTC wallet addresses!
Easy to do with a total scam like XLM when the creators hold 80% of the undistributed funds.

Or maybe they were simply waiting for the bitcoin core code to be finished and released so as not to lose everyone’s money...

Probably because SegWit just landed in Bitcoin Core and the sys admin has to double click on the `bitcoin-0.16.0-win64-setup.exe` file

Yep, you can't send large, infrequent transactions on Lightning and you can't send small, frequent transactions on Bitcoin. Conclusion: both have completely failed. /s

Only trade say 20% of your stash. Keep the rest in cold storage. That’ll satisfy the itch but reduce your losses.

It would be really hard for Bitcoin to really fail. If a completely new better technology comes along, Bitcoin can just copy all the unspent transaction outputs to a v2 chain and go from there.

Also $300,000 to $400,000 is the $7T marketcap Gold equivalence zone. Fundamentals are all there, the supply is 84% fully mined, and inflation is 3.78% and dropping. We just need Trump to do the Bitcoin tweet.

This. Most transactions will save ~40% on fees by upgrading to native SegWit-Bech32 or ~30% by upgrading to SegWit-P2SH.

Since any new tech can be uplifted into Bitcoin or as a softfork, hardfork or as a sidechain, since everything has to be open source in order to be trustworthy, you might as well not diversify except for maybe ZCash, since everybody is free to copy the things that are useful.
If anybody does anything useful, it can be incorporated into the leading project...which is Bitcoin. It's basically impossible to have a competitive advantage.

Lightning isn’t BTC specific. It works with any compatible cryptocurrency.

$300,000 to $400,000 is accurate as it would be the gold equivalence level.
