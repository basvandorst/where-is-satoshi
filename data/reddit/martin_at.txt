So much confusion... Well we plan to make the names of all things as a variable. So if they complain I can easily change all of them at once in the code... Also we will add a big disclaimer when launching/resuming the game.
Well I am in Japan - Nagoya the other two are in Europe. As you know the Shinkansen is expensive but otherwise I would join the meet ups. Never heard of a community in Nagoya though... :(

I will definitely be a few times in Tokyo for business and sight-seeing purposes in this summer timeframe. 
I will write you PM when I know some details. Maybe we can arrange to have a meeting over some coffee :)

Thank you for the good information. We are an enthusiastic team of 3 people working in our free time on our project and hope to be able to publish it in time for the next bubble or to even ignite the next bubble with it. ;)
I have a few concerns with the statement "it was against their policy for a game to represent a virtual currency". There are probably 10000 altcoins in existence and probably EVERY possible name is already taken. Even if I would come up with a new name like SaruTobiCoin the next that will happen is that somebody creates exactly this altcoin.
I just have a problem with their logic. So you are not supposed to select names for real world currencies/things. So I guess although Bitcoin is a virtual currency it is considered a real thing. But bananas are also a real thing. People could sue you because they could think they earned real bananas...
Also many games use maybe something called "credits". What would happen if Bitcoin would be surpassed by an altcoin called Credits?
Actually, do you know if it is allowed to use Fiat currency names in a game? I would like to price items in USD for example.
Since I do not plan to include real Bitcoin tipping in the game I hope I will have less problems. Anyway I think it is a gamble at this stage and the rules for iOS and Android are not clearly defined yet.
@_date: 2015-06-07 21:02:58
Dear MandelDuck, we love your game!
Also we are developing our own Bitcoin related game at the moment. Totally different type of game though, so no threat for you ;)
Could you please explain why you changed the wording of the ingame coins to bananas, black coin and now Sarutobi Coins? Was the iStore team behind this change? Is there a set of rules we don't know about. Is Bitcoin on a list of words you are not allowed to use? Does it make a difference if Bitcoin tipping is used in the game or not? How about Android? Any rules there? We plan to start with Android. Any other suggestions do help game developers in the Bitcoin space avoid pitfalls?
Greetings from Japan ;)

Lets assume I bought 1 Bitcoin for 100$ and kept it for some time. Later on, I go to an online merchant which only accepts Bitcoin in exchange for his goods and the prices are also only denoted in Bitcoin and not in Dollar. Now I buy there something for 1 Bitcoin. What are my tax liabilities then, as I don't know the Dollar value of the good?
What if the value of Bitcoin compared to the Dollar increases over time and the merchant decreases the price of his goods (denoted in Bitcoin but constant in Dollar), lets say he does this not on the fly but only once a day.
If, in the case of Bitcoin denominated prices, I would have to pay taxes on capital gains, this would be pretty crazy. With the Dollar this would for example mean I would have to pay taxes if the gas price decreased from one day to the next... because you know my money is now worth more...

What would be, if the US would regulate all exchanges in the US out of existence but bartering Bitcoin would still be allowed. Where should I get my value in Dollar for one Bitcoin then?
Also now, which Dollar value should I assume, as the prices are pretty wide spread across the various exchanges and additionally change over the course of a day quite spectacularly...

As I wrote I think the simulated nodes do not need to do hashing. In the whole simulation the nodes can be honestly dishonest to simulate an attack. I am imagining an abstract model here. This means not all details like hashing have to be implemented. Also no full blocks have to be transmitted. In the transient simulation it would only be considered how long the transmission of a block of a certain size would need to be transmitted.
System-C anyone?
@_date: 2015-05-11 14:12:53
I though TestNet ( runs in real time and is practically a cloned Bitcoin distributed over the whole world. I mean a model running on one PC only. It does not need to have full functionality though. It only should enable to study the effects of certain settings to the network behavior like confirmation time, security, reward distribution, ...
@_date: 2015-05-12 00:52:11
OP is back...
It think a first step would be to build the model without modeling the human behavior behind the nodes. So I think not so many parameters for the nodes are required. A few would be: Peer connections, number of transactions, size of transactions, bandwidth of the nodes, ping between the nodes, times to check a block, time to accept a block, etc...
You can currently find some statistics of a node in this guys thread: 
I would also add for each parameter a distribution parameter to model some random variation. We could apply a Gaussian or a Poisson distribution.
This would already enable us then to simulate if a block time decrease by a factor of 10x would reduce the relative reward for small and slow miner nodes for 10% or 1% or whatever %.
A second step then could be to include economic behavior of the nodes. But this could be difficult because not all miners behave perfectly rational and new models like 21 Inc are popping up.
Nevertheless, I think such a simulation is absolutely vital to be able to take educated decisions. Sure a full emulation of the network with real nodes on a TestNet would be more accurate but I don't think Gavin has the resources (at least not yet) to set up hundreds of nodes at MIT. Also then you would be still limited to real time emulations which would slow down investigations....
Is Gavin reading this here???

Busan is nice. I visited Chagalchi fish market there last year and I think it is better than the fish market in Seoul...

I tried it today in Nagoya. Did not work :(
@_date: 2015-05-22 23:42:24
So I guess the simulation mentioned in this text is the result of me proposing to do this here two weeks ago:
Thanks Gavin for implementing this. The numbers now give a good picture of how small the problem really is for 20MB blocks and if no further road blocks come up it looks good for this change!
@_date: 2015-05-16 09:08:16
I just tried it in Japan. They scanned the code but then said that it does not work in Japan... Refund process is very convenient too...
I would love it though if it would work... 
@_date: 2015-05-12 01:15:30
Yes indeed, you can do all that with TestNet if you can afford to set up man many nodes. I guess not even Gavin has the necessary resources for a meaningful number of nodes at MIT now.
A simulator would have the following advantages: You could run it on one PC with no network required, you can speed up the simulation time since with TestNet it would have to run in real time only, it would be much easier to change parameters (It is like saying in the future we will optimize the code so that transaction validation only takes half the time. That is easy to change in the model since it is only one parameter but for TestNet you would really have to do the full code development first), you can easily simulate sweeps over for example the block time and generate nice plots which then show trends and sweet spots.

Most likely the SEC will not exist any more. But if it does it will be a private company and its stocks would be traded on the Bitcoin blockchain. The purpose would be to guide its voluntary customers with exchange matters. Maybe also insure them.
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:21:00
Assumption: A 99.99% to 0.01% split occurs because somebody and his 2 friends fork away from the main chain. You happen to have some coins on an exchange (you do not control the keys). The exchange decides to go with the 0.01% chain and to not refund you the 99.99% coins. This is legally okay? It is almost like stealing 99.99% of your wealth... No legal implications for the exchange to be expected?

Change the y-axis to logarithmic scaling. Linear makes little sense here. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-09-03 04:17:37
I see. Your motivation to make the y-axis linear is to make it look like the block size will explode. On the other hand a logarithmic scaling would make the increase look like totally normal.
As others mentioned, we should plan for success. So growth should be exponential. Means that also the number of transactions and block size will grow exponentially. And yes, also the network flow in such a P2P network will grow exponentially. 
Not possible because computers are not expected to get a lot faster any more? Wait for the ASICs which are built not for mining but for full node opeartion :)
@_date: 2015-09-03 02:19:27
No it does not. All these things grow (or should grow) exponentially. For example the hash rate, the number of users and also the price (long term). If we change over to a long term linear growth it means we are shrinking in market share long term as the total market also grows exponentially. Do the math!

So when can I get a keyboard with the Bitcoin symbol on it instead of the Dollar/Euro/Yen/... sign? 
@_date: 2017-06-07 02:33:59
Please note, I only referred to Bitcoin, not Blockchain. Bitcoin is an open and permission less money. That is the big thing which will impact every one of us. For now it seems blockchain is the only solution for this, but in the future maybe other underlying database systems will emerge.
If the banks want to use a blockchain (instead of much much more efficient other database systems) for their own closed and controllable payment/money system, then they are welcome to do so. But I do not care and I will not put my trust/wealth into that.

Dismissing Bitcoin (the currency) and instead emphasizing the value of blockchain (the technology enabling it) is similar to dismissing candy (the food) and instead emphasizing the value of sugar (the ingredient enabling it).
You want the delicious candy but you don't care about (or even dislike) the sugar.
You want Bitcoin but you don't care about (or even dislike) the blockchain.
Later we maybe will swapt out the sugar and replace it with e.g. stevia. 
Comparably we maybe will swap out the blockchain and replace it with a succeeding database technology.
Conclusion: Bitcoin is what will improve the average Joe's life. The blockchain technology behind it is nice but the average Joe doesn't care. Ignore or better object when some people (mostly central bankers) dismiss Bitcoin.

This is so true! But when Breaking Bad first aired in 2008, HD was not yet so wide spread. 
One could also argue that the videos are compressed and the blockchain is not. So in the future some pruning or compression of the blockchain will probably help to keep the file size within acceptable boundaries.
@_date: 2013-09-28 17:17:19
Thanks for the hint... I have a PhD in electronics myself, so no teacher needed but I wanted this chart to be for the masses and I don't know if they can interpret a log scale chart ;)
@_date: 2013-09-28 11:17:43
This is exactly what my diagram illustrates. Things like video collections also grow over time. The change-over to HD accelerated the growth. In the future I guess 4k, high framerate, 3D and HDR will accelerate the growth of video collections, as will increased adoption for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-09-28 10:48:45
As we are about to break the 10 GByte threshold for the blockchain and Breaking Bad is about to have its final episode this Sunday, I made a comparison of the blockchain size and my (totally legal...) Breaking Bad video collection size over time. Now stop complaining about the the size of the blockchain!
@_date: 2013-09-28 17:21:04
For certain clients the heavy reads are true for sure. I'm not sure if this is the same for the next version of the Armory client I love so much, since it will do some indexing and will not have to reread the whole blockchain during start-up, but I'm not the expert ;)
