\&gt; It is far harder to hide a pay cut on people. You must be privileged to think automatic increase every year to cover inflation is common. Yes, maybe for professionals it is. I have always worked low pay jobs and my colleagues are always trilled to get a pay raise. They never seem to understand that it is below inflation year after year.
inflation is something EVERYONE learns in school. At least in Europe, most blue collar workers are unionized and get a rise every year and people who work in low pay jobs that don't need any education switching their jobs a lot anyways.
\&gt; Money will always be put out to work. Loans and liquidity will always be available as people seek more than the 2-3% gain from just sitting on their Bitcoin.
but a deflation will increase the costs of a loan. It will always cost at least the deflation rate + some risk premium. Inflation can bring the real cost of a loan below zero in contrast.
\&gt; As there will be a viable store of value with high liquidity in Bitcoin, real estate will become less of a place for the wealthy to park their money. The monetary premium on houses will come down making them cheaper and lowering rents helping the low wage workers even more.
well, more people investing in real estate means more houses and flats are going to be built because it's more profitable. Also peoples rent will increase every year if they don't negotiate new terms with the landlord.

not food but for cars, tvs and smartphones...




or you could just invest or lend out that money to negate the effect of inflation... which is supposed to happen otherwise businesses won't have that money they need.
@_date: 2019-07-09 16:43:48


and where do you think the government employees, contractors and businesses involved store their money?... usually on a bank which means there is a high amount of liquidity that can be loaned out.


that didn't answer my question. No economy is using bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-07 18:49:24
and in a "deflationary system" they get wealthier by doing nothing while the working class gets paid less bitcoin every year.
@_date: 2019-07-12 12:20:16
it's also the most used.
@_date: 2019-07-07 23:38:00


that's not true. That printed money has to go somewhere.


you seem to get your education from youtube videos and blog posts. Let's keep it simple and i gonna ask you a single question:
If a deflationary currency is superior then why isn't there a single successful economy using a deflationary currency? Historical there were many attempts and actually was pretty common in past when money was pegged to gold.
@_date: 2019-07-07 21:53:54
\&gt; ou seem to be confused. In a deflationary system everyone's purchasing power increases over time including the savings of the poor
you seem to be confused. Deflation means falling prices and falling prices mean that employees have to get paid less in nominal terms. AKA they get a pay cut every year or get laid off. Most people who live from paycheck to paycheck don't profit from a deflation.
\&gt; The working class get paid less every year in the current system as their wages stagnate and do not keep up with inflation.
it's pretty common to get an automatic increase every year to cover inflation. 
\&gt; Inflationary monies is the greatest fraud every committed on humanity. Only those closest to the money printing presses are rewarded through the Cantillion effect.
and people who hoard bitcoins get rewarded by doing nothing while the working class can't get loans or liquidity and businesses have a harder time acquiring investors.
@_date: 2019-07-07 23:30:58
nice arguments. Nothing to do with what I have written... just random rambling about how awesome bitcoin is.
\&gt; Why do regular people relentlessly argue to preserve the status quo? Just because you are doing fine doesn't mean the system is failing large swaths of people. You are afraid of change.
why do people who fail always try to blame everyone else or "the system" ? I'm doing fine because i went to college and worked my ass off... so yes, i have no reason to complain.
\&gt; When it becomes financialized nobody in their right mind would hold savings in an inflationary currency when the option to use a deflationary one is right there.
and nobody would buy anything with a deflationary currency as long as they can use an inflationary one. Most companies like reddit, steam, trivago and so on dropped bitcoin a while ago and actual usage of bitcoin as a currency is underwhelming.
@_date: 2019-07-07 18:51:43


you can... by buying assets or investing.
@_date: 2019-07-07 23:26:44
\&gt;But they can buy more stuff every year with the Bitcoin... 
and they have to get a nominal pay cut for that to be possible.
\&gt; Why would you want to be paid more but you end up getting less because the purchasing power has decreased?
usually, you get paid the same if you ask your employer to adjust your salary for inflation.
@_date: 2019-03-17 16:04:16


the point is that these data centers still need like 0.1% of bitcoins energy consumption if you put it into the releation of how many transactions they handle

There are different mechnaism that differ between countries:
"A netting engine consolidates all of the pending payments into fewer single transactions. For example, if Bank of America is to pay American Express US$1.2 million, and American Express is to pay Bank of America $800,000, the CHIPS system aggregates this to a single payment of $400,000 from Bank of America to American Express — only 20% of the $2 million to be transferred actually changes hands."
pretty much exactly what i have described
and there is also Fedwire for the US
"This information is submitted to the Federal Reserve via the Fedwire system. Once the instructions are received and processed, the Fed will **debit the funds from the sending bank's reserve account and credit the receiving bank's account.**"
so you literaly shift liabilites around... ofc that this is a liability between banks it just gets settled by the Fed system.


not sure what you are trying to tell me. the bank could also borrow more money from the central bank (lender of last resort).


so Person A borrows money and buy a house from person B from the same bank? Now the Person A owes the bank money while the Bank owe Person B money that he put in to his account. Again...just shifting liabilities...
@_date: 2019-03-17 14:36:28
what makes you think banks aren't needed with bitcoin anymore? the transfer of money over a bank account is just a tiny fraction of the business model of a bank... they make the most money with loans, consulting, real estate, brokering and other stuff... all which will still in need with bitcoin.
I mean there are online banks without branches, towers and huge ass data centers and still be able to serve millions of transactions every week. 
and the other arguments about flying around bank officials to meetings and armored trucks are kinda minuscule in the grand scheme of things.
@_date: 2019-03-17 18:49:01
simple math proves you wrong: more transaction = higher adoption = higher bitcoin price = higher mining rewards.
also bitcoin needs to use a high amount of energy to secure the network... otherwise it would be vulnerable.
@_date: 2019-03-17 19:10:16


why not? at least higher adoption equals more transactions


it went close to a possible 50% attack a few times by now. Also while computers getting faster and doing more with less energy consumptions, bitcoin needs to increase its security with usually more power consumption (in comparison) in order to stay ahead and be secure enough.

@_date: 2019-03-28 13:29:43


or just a contract that they will send them actual bitcoins at some point in the future... or maybe some cooperation and they settle the difference of bitcoins flowing in both directions at the end of every month.


well, people wont pull out their bitcoins in such case when the service is established, backed by insurances and the taxpayers... and people will happely put their bitcoin on such a service if it offers them a 2% interest rate.




thats not really how it works... the central banks and all commercial banks have liabilities with each other and it just gets shifted around... so one bank owes the cb less and the other more but first they will shift the liabilites between each other.
@_date: 2019-03-28 10:27:05


well, most people's jobs depend on these 20%
@_date: 2019-03-28 16:01:23




im not arguing that there is no "money" created here. Its quite the opposite.
You seem to have understood that debt is money which also means that debt (in bitcoins) can be equal to actual bitcoins like debt (in checkbook money) can be equal to physical bank notes.
wich means you can do the exact same example with bitcoin aswell and thus creating more bitcoins this way...  you can also leverage it, sell it further, use it as asset to borrow more and so on...

and its impossible for coinbase to transfer "digital" bitcoins to another exchange? 


why is there even a need for that? does a bank send actual physical bills to another bank? Can a bank hand out cash to every customer on a bank run? in business almost everything work through balance sheets... 


any business or even individuals can do this. Its just a liability and it doesnt matter if you value that in bitcoins or fiat.

there is no doubt that this is possible. Like i told you: exchanges and payment processors already using bitcoin debt. Through margin calls or just merchants getting bitcoins credited in an account, they can withdraw from.
it doesn't matter what the bitcoin ledger or what the central bank ledger says... actually these two things have almost nothing to do with creating debt which was possible way before modern currency was invented.

@_date: 2019-03-28 10:30:51

but you still have to lock up bitcoins in the LN network and have to take care about stuff like watchtowers and so on. It's still far more complicated compared to just adding your bank info in your paypal account that gets automatically withdrawn


it's still another middleman.


if you don't have access to that loan on a bank account... well... then you probably don't have to pay it back.


don't think gold related financial products are hardly affected by a recession. Also, fiat is so stable because of how central banks operate to keep the inflation / deflation in line. Noone knows how bitcoin gonna behave.


not just that, also simple cybercrime. If someone somehow gets access to your bitcoins or people to scam you in some way you can't even imagine right now then your coins are lost... without a chance to ever get them back.

the "audit the fed" bill is not really about auditing the fed. Its about controlling the fed and taking influence which is strongly opposed by economics and many others for a reason.
"Fed leaders do make their decisions behind closed doors. But the central bank is audited twice a year -- once by the government through the Fed's inspector general and once by a private auditor. Critics of the bill question the point of a third audit.
Right now, GAO officials don't attend Fed meetings and are unable to second-guess its decisions. Yellen argues that the proposed law would give them that power.
"Political parties should not run monetary policy at the Federal Reserve," Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said in a floor speech Monday. "It is obvious to me that the audit-the-Fed is an attempt to allow Congress to be able to put pressure on Fed members relative to monetary policy."

with PayPal, you can just click on a button to pay... no phone needed. I also can get my money back if the merchant tries to scam me... I won't get that advantage when buying with crypto.


that's way too complicated for a lot of people... most elderly are already struggling with online banking.


well, most people care. Currently, banks are simply not in demand of capital.


you can't always perfectly time a loan when you in need of liquidity. Maybe it's a consumer loan that will be spent over months... also you still have to fill out quite a lot of papers and get it approved every time you take out a loan and thus you can't just take one the day you need it.

they still need more than a single click to pay? usually, I need to transact to a specific address and sometimes have to wait until it's confirmed. LN may be faster but has currently almost no adoption at all and adds another layer of complexity ontop...


services like purse.io are very limited... It's basically just a marketplace for amazon gift cards. Some bigger actual escrow service the size of paypal would be just another bank


you won't, but it's still better than and less work than withdrawing everything immediately... 


do you really need your life savings as liquid currency? As for now, you have to sell your bitcoins anyways to be able to fully participate in all economic activities... or if bitcoin would take over everything that you would have to get your bitcoins into the LN and maybe 3rd layer first as well... not that much different then clicking sell on your gold certificates or other non fiat products in your depot and withdraw that money.


that daily amount you can get is very limited. Nothing that should be able to ruin your financial life.

who is denying facts? its an easily verifiable fact that the fed gets audited by several institutions. Saying they don't get audited is just plain wrong.
It's also an easily verifiable fact that that screencap of Yellen is out of context. It's not about auditing transactions (which is already done by other audits)... it's about auditing the decisionmaking process in a way that allows the government to take influence. That's a violation of the fundamental principle of independent central banks.

\&gt; Good point, but what about the people taking the loans? They won't want to hold the keys?
do people want loans in dollars to be paid out in cash? as long as you can use that number on your bitcoin bank account to buy stuff and its safe, people will keep it there for convenience... also you get interest for your loans as well.
\&gt; The ability for banks to print money will still be severely limited compared to the status quo.
if people use bitcoin banks then banks can loan out bitcoin and thus increasing the defacto bitcoin supply like they normal banks do with fiat.

the number in your bank account is not "your money". Its the money the bank owes you... its nothing more than a promise and a transaction is nothing more than trading that promise to another person.

\&gt;Your claim is you can create bitcoin out of thin air--there is not cost for you to do this.
no, i said that bitcoin can be created out of thin air with a loan like fiat money can be created of thin air with loans. You should put more effort into your reading skills.
@_date: 2019-04-17 21:35:08
sure they can... you can create debt noted in bitcoins and trade it around like real bitcoins as we do now with fiat.
look at cryptoexchanges, for example, you can make margin calls and use leverages to buy/sell cryptocurrencies. The exchange essentially loans you coins that don't exist but you can still trade them...

monetary supply doesn't matter in 99% of cases since it has no direct effect on the people and there is often the situation where the money supply stays steady while there is high inflation or deflation.
Also, I highly doubt that most people here know the difference since they call  fiat inflationary (doesn't have to be, neither monetary or otherwise) and claiming that the government/central bank stealing their money by printing more... while that is not necessarily increasing prices of goods and services.

\&gt;  You seem to think a "bank run" causes bankruptcy. 
sure it can. says it right on the corresponding Wikipedia page. " This can destabilize the bank to the point where it runs out of cash and thus faces sudden [bankruptcy]( "
if you loan a bank 10$ and they loan it to somewhere else then they have an asset but no liquidity... the liquidity the bank can get from the central banks has its limits (lender of last resort) as well as the liquidity other banks can and want to provide.
\&gt; Nope, that depends too. Some will accept it that way and some will not UNTIL there is a real bank ru

a central bank usually doesn't create free money. They lend out money to commercial banks for interest and the commercial banks. So it's not free.
They can also buy assets which some are considering as creating free money.


commercial banks can create money... for a price and other ways for a central bank to create money has its limits. The situation of deflation while the central bank can't create money happened several times during the past 100 years.

@_date: 2019-04-28 18:58:24


like bitcoin?


interest can be cheap... sometimes even barely beating inflation. and people often invest just to cut costs more... and to invest the often need to borrow...


what if you don't have the liquidity? sell your assets and wait forever?
what is a farmer doing whos tractor broke? picking up crops by hand until he can affort a new one? rofl...


so kinda like stocks and part holding? you such a genius... 


and that's the problem... because in most cases avoidance means not investing at all. 


you won't if keeping his bitcoins and doing nothing gains him more profit. I mean, come on... this so basic...


it's not sustainable because of the high price of money... and so decreasing economic activity and jobs.


but the company first needs to invest.


that's what triggers innovation... since everything new has a risk of not delivering


how do you think innovation happens? it happens incrementally and if a company can't sell their +5% efficiency machine there probably won't be a +20% one a few years down the road.


while it's true that cheap money flows into real estate (mostly in cities) and makes houses more expensive it is also a market force that gives an incentive to build new homes. With high-interest rates, fewer people will be able to afford their own home and prices won't fall much since more people want to live in big cities.


so working 20 years with a good job just to buy a house in a rural area? rofl... have fun having kids and a wife during that time. Maybe you will be able to afford your own home when you 80 years old.


i mean you claiming that everyone understands inflation/deflation but you completely miss the point yourself... it doesn't matter how many bitcoins are in circulation and the only thing that matters is what they buy. How can you say that someone who inherits 10 bitcoin that maybe buy you a house is not getting richer when the same bitcoins maybe buy you 2 houses 10 years down the road? you don't seem to properly understand the concept of increasing or decreasing prices levels...


again, monetary supply doesn't matter since it doesn't affect people. Increasing or decreasing price levels do...


people still will need liquidity and don't want to live with their family in a 2 room apartment for rent the rest of their lives so they will borrow money for an excessive interest rate making the "haves" even richer than the "have nots"

depends on how the exchanges are regulated :) 
if people trust them so much that they set their account balance equal to actual bitcoins as we do with money on a bank account they can create as much as they are able to loan out.
@_date: 2019-04-17 23:33:20


ever heard of Greece banks? lehman brothers? all the other banks that went bankrupt? If more people default on their loans then a bank makes through interest then a bank makes a loss like every ohter business... 


and so you could do with bitcoin... there is nothing special or magic about it like your little cringy video implied...
@_date: 2019-04-17 23:40:38

@_date: 2019-04-17 22:00:45


and so can do banks with bitcoins if you loan them to a bank


and? the central bank is the only entity that can actually create money


the banks can hand out as many IOUs as they want. It doesn't matter if these IOU are in bitcoin or in fiat... debt is still money. As long as people put their fiat or bitcoins in a bank or exchange account it can be loaned out even with only a fraction actually backing it.
@_date: 2019-04-18 00:41:34
\&gt; This is nuts. This is literally how money expansion works.
yes, this is how money expansions work. But doesn't change the fact that there are people needed that loan that money back to another bank for interest...
\&gt; Stop trying to conflate bank runs, bankruptcy, and money creation.
im not conflicting anything. A bank run can lead to a bankruptcy but an actual bank run usually happens when the bank is already ill. And that happened quite a lot in the past decades.
\&gt; Stick to money creation. This is literally how money creation works.
yes by handing out loans which every legal person can do as well.

@_date: 2019-04-18 00:11:16
\&gt; There is definitely a chance of those payment processors experiencing a REAL bank run. 
yes, there is like on a real bank. A bank can always go bankrupt and is only insured to a certain amount of money.
\&gt; To my knowledge, most payment processors pay near-immediately in USD.

@_date: 2019-04-28 11:17:30


it's still confusing people when every schoolbook, lexicon or news anchor refers to the mainstream definition of inflation. There is literally no need to redefine terms and this tactic is usually used by extremist political streams to deceive people.




all of these problems could be solved by just using a token that represents ownership of a specific amount of metal in some vault.  not just backed but actual proof of ownership. These gold certificates were used as currency in the past and vanished as well.
Faking currencies is a non-issue today and in the past or at least fiat had the exact same problem.


obv. you have to use history as a base to build a model that you can put to the test. You cant put human behavior into a purely mathematical function without relying on some kind of assumptions. Why inflation is good or at least why deflation is very bad can be read up in most mainstream eco-books. Slight inflation has a positive effect on investing and consumption while deflation does the opposite and makes borrowing money more expensive and increases the social divide and so on...
@_date: 2019-04-17 22:54:22


? if my promise is as credible as the banks promise and traded like real money then sure the money supply has increased...


well, sure. There is a reason why there needs to be a regulation... see all the bitcoin exchanges and scams that collapsed.

sure, go an exchange and buy bitcoin bitcoin I put there on a leverage.
@_date: 2019-04-28 11:54:11


the same issue has fiat yet people can live with it. This doesn't have anything to do with deflation or inflation. If people trust that 50 goldmark or whatever represents x amount of gold and they can claim then its worth that amount of gold.


that's pretty much what mainstream economics is doing.


well, most is backed by empirical evidence like history or social experiment. The rest is backed by logic based on "strong base assumption"


no one is saying that "economic activity will just stop". It slows down and causes cascading effects but it won't stop all economic activities. Japan had a deflationary period for a long time and they are still alive... but they didn't grow as much as most other countries and lost its leading industrial position it had in the 80s.


people buying things they don't really need is wasteful? yes, but it creates jobs, gives satisfaction and triggers innovations.


you often need to borrow in most cases in order to invest. Deflation makes borrowing more expensive and if a new machine increases the output by x% but the interest rate is too high then there won't be an investment in that machine... and that means that the company who sells that machine will make less profit and need less workforce / has to lay off people and so on.
Most people wouldn't be able to afford real estate without borrowing money fist.


how does someone who inherit bitcoins from his parents and getting richer and richer just by doing nothing be ANY better then someone who inherits fiat that he has to invest and put back into the economy in order to keep his wealth???
@_date: 2019-04-29 16:34:48

@_date: 2019-04-29 21:40:14


that's not a general rule, the interest is normally higher than the inflation if you are not Switzerland. Also, people hoarding means they arent investing which is bad for innovation and the economy.

normally inflation is defined as a "sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time."
That doesn't necessarily have anything to do with the monetary supply of a currency. Bitcoin has monetary inflation till more coins are lost then mined and "normal" inflation during a bear market and deflation during a bull phase.

if bitcoin would completely replace gold (currently total know gold is evaluated at 7 trillion) then a single bitcoin would have to be worth 350k... (not even considering all the lost coins) a single block would yield 2,2 million (350k * 6,25) reward and that would be around 115.000.000.000$ per year on rewards alone... that's a lot of energy you could throw into the bitcoin network until you break even.

"debt-based" is such buzzword. People have no clue what it means and just build conspiracies around it. Bitcoin can be lent and borrowed. Even bitcoins that don't exist can be lent or borrowed as you can do with fiat.
the number your bank account shows its not your money... it the money the bank owes you and the same is true for bitcoins in crypto exchanges. You can do fractional reserve with bitcoin as well since that numbers in peoples bank/exchange accounts is just what they are owed and not real bitcoins or fiat.
so yes, this topic is riddled with half-truths and lack of understanding that is the base of these conspiracy theories.
