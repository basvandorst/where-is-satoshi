Why should I be banned, I'm just stating an opinion. Do you hate freedom of speech?

this is the highest its going to be until at least the middle of this week when we see $260 or $270. better to get max value now and rebuy in when the china fud blows over than to hold and lose a bunch of money.
edit: this is an opportunity to make a shit ton of money. all the technical indicators point to us going to one of the prev all time highs, so why not capitalize on that knowledge?

The reason you're being down voted is that this should have been posted in log scale, that makes it look less scary. To answer your question, we're actually in a bear trap right now.

sorry i just spontaneously wrote down the first thing that came to mind when picking my username. i shoulda spent more time picking a good name.
in any case, if you're not day trading bitcoin then i don't know what the hell you're doing with your life. this thing is so volatile its a gold mine and i've been milking it for all its worth.

I personally already sold my entire position, waiting for this to blow over before rebuying at the low, probs around $260 or so (one of the prev all time high)

I'm just in it to make quick ez money. bitcoin is in full tanking mode so we can make money on the downswing, then buy up cheap coins and make a bunch more on the upswing.

We'll get there by Thursday at the latest, I'm expecting more likely wednesday.

i think maybe the problem is that it will become too expensive for us regular ppl to mine bitcoins, so only big companies will be able to afford to do it. since statists and corporatists are in bed together, they will control the entire hashing rate and then what happens? hmm? then they (the statists) will just shut it down (the network) by offering the corporatists with a bunch of wealth in some physical form (maybe gold or something rare). its gonna be a bad day for btc when that happens.
