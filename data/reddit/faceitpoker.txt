I like that response. Very detailed. I don't know maybe i just hate change. Im used to google. I might try ddg though, i love functionality. Just dont know if i'll really explore it very much, or just do my searches the way i always use to

Proof to "HFT happening" ?

I don't believe the story of him losing anything, he still hasn't proven that. And if he had lost that much he wouldve never been able to show his cold wallet on the blockchain afterwards. There's too much stuff that could not have happened in this scenario. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 16:12:42
but they wont

proven facts like what? debate the guy, he will be very respectful in a debate
@_date: 2014-12-22 19:39:16
Tell me about it.

well if not then he is now

Yeah i already saw that and there's nothing pretty much there. Just a message.

As opposed to?

mark has all the qr codes on his back ,but after gaining all that weight ,you can't retrieve them 
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:00:00
Gather together with all your bitcoin foundation friends and buy out gox for 10 cents on the dollar. Get it going again. Customers have to get their fiat is the least you can do. Just 5 of you have enough to cover their balance. Mark has 200 000 btc, you have close to it, run the exchange with better programmers and staff. Otherwise the whole bitcoin experiment is dead. And you guys shouldnt be public figures any longer.
@_date: 2014-10-10 02:32:51
My question exactly.

bitcoin gives karpeles 500 million $
@_date: 2014-09-08 17:24:54
I don't understand what you mean by "noone believed him". It's not like the market is going to put billions of dollars into bitcoin because of what marc says. Not this one anyway, only karpeles can and will get away with that.
Marc is a guy that invests in bitcoin companies so.... I think he was adamant about bitcoin and everyone who knew about him knew that. So if you knew about him, you 'believed' him.
@_date: 2014-07-07 05:17:56
How so?
@_date: 2014-02-16 13:30:29
I thought he was using those blockchain hex codes to manually force transactions
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:17:34

Providing bitcoin is actually anonymous
@_date: 2014-02-15 04:36:39
But isn't the issue with malleability going to fuck up any transactions we try doing with your exchange? Please tell me how this is not true. How do you force a transactions without confirmations without getting double spends and hackers all over it ?

well in stoks its not the same thing, but for commodities and currencies ,yes ,% is more important for the most part. linear scale also gives you a perspective on how much money is flowing in and out ,and what the liquidity is ,better than a % log scale

I think reddit is the best for that sort of thing
@_date: 2014-02-24 14:33:02
Im not sure how that's done, but i was a witness
@_date: 2014-06-02 16:54:23
Is that true?

What is stealth adresses? I don't know if coin mixing is too good of an idea. It's good but also sort of creepy as far as criminal elements online. There's way too many issues to fix with bitcoin before we go into coinmixing

The gold standard is just as stupid,but that's probably the only real similarity it has with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-17 18:44:54
I don't think anyone has, since it was never a functioning site from what i saw on the archive

They can get bought by another exchange or company for a fraction of the cost of the actual company,if they still have at least 20% of the money. or they can get sued out of existance. In fact the word "can" is erroneous , the correct wording is - they SHOULD.
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:26:22
In the wayback archive it never shows up as an actual website though
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:24:52
I would buy a goxboner for 85%
@_date: 2014-02-15 13:27:24
Well i just sent 9 btc and still haven't received, why does it take time to confirm? 30 minutes waiting?
@_date: 2014-07-08 11:53:32
Im still not sure why google isnt better. I mean i can get the ghostery add on or something like that and not get all those google analytics and stuff bothering me ,and google should probably be the better out of the two 
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:48:44
Dude ,it took months ,not days

zhou tong stole money how?!
@_date: 2014-02-17 13:25:43
Yeah i've seen that as well, and i think it just means , mtgox was just a domain name ,never an exchange before being a bitcoin exchange
@_date: 2014-02-16 21:26:24
Well ,at least functional. I mean.. just 2 lines of text.. That's not a site, that's a wasted domain space

True, but why would i use ddg
@_date: 2014-03-03 07:17:20
but there werent 1 million bitcoins in existance/ on gox in 2011...

@_date: 2014-02-15 23:40:34
by the way i still don't understand what method he uses for transfering btc from the user account's gox deposit adress and real deposit adress?
@_date: 2014-12-20 14:58:11
Why are you idiots comparing him to HSBC. How about something more close to home like MTGOX. None of you idiots are still talking about the greatest heist in the history of bitcoin, as if its irrelevant, but youre still talking about HSBC. Fucking morons.
@_date: 2014-07-07 13:14:38

That is also a good point

yes woosh. i dont even WANT to understand idiots like YOU.
@_date: 2014-03-02 00:37:57
another great point

unless you can effectively do an "IPO" effective immediately by stealing everyone's money. i think it makes complete sense, he can't make 800 000 btc in profit for 20 years into the future.

So did the hippies. That doesn't mean that being a hippie is generally constructive.
Just because i can agree with the intention, doesn't mean i approve of the method. Just like, correlation doesn't imply causation. Two things that are related don't neccessarily have to follow one another. In fact anarchy is probably where criminals thrive the most. Humans have the inate ability/bias to normalize deviations ,lets say you see murders on the streets every day, you can normalize that in your mind. But if you live in a world where everything's generally okay, your human mind can begin to greatly overstate the fat tail risk of large-scale catastrophies like world wars etc. Doesn't mean they won't happen, it just means that the fear of them is irrational and the common solutions are also such. Bitcoin remains to prove itself either way as well... by the way.
@_date: 2014-02-28 01:32:28

And now nobody from the mtgox debacle has any $ ,so there's no problem ,right?

No because nothing is measured vs itself. Btc is chosen to be valued in usd, so i think verlorenes might be right.
@_date: 2014-07-07 10:58:57
Oh, i forgot where i was at.
You're most certainly right about that one.
@_date: 2014-10-14 02:09:02
standard procedure at mtgox as well
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:55:06
Right. I believe everything mark says..
@_date: 2014-10-14 04:27:34
Thats what karpeles said
@_date: 2014-03-01 15:14:20
no its not.
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:41:29
Well they were 80% of the market or more

I love the central banker picture for a thumbnail on this. How very anarchist of r/bitcoin
@_date: 2014-02-27 21:26:16
The most optimistic and positive thing i could think of out of the whole situation is that wall street in combination with the govrenment want to take over gox and they were attacking them.... That would make mark karpeles a hero, and the entire bitcoin foundation a bunch of assholes that missrepresented reality for far too long until all the little guys were fucked over and they got what they wanted. But now they will become a regulatory body for bitcoin. What a joke.
@_date: 2017-02-21 16:03:21
how did you come up with that theory? although it does sound like an interesting one... i must say... that would end in a conspiracy that - bitcoin is being pushed on to the masses, so that the unaccountable majority ,the idiots, the anonymous ones , get their shot at greatness, and they do get their greatness and that greatness costs them their souls? because why else would they give people that kind of profitable opportunity , that is so easy... easy profits are never easy and are never cheap. they cost something. bitcoin costs nothing and is meaningless ,and yet we get to make money off it? what a horrendous and retarded philosophy in my opinion.
@_date: 2014-11-06 14:53:51
That's an irrelevant comment. 
@_date: 2014-09-08 12:53:14
TLDR - So why didn't i get rich?
@_date: 2015-01-03 06:32:10
Well.. up to a point ,and then they would continue increasing 
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:19:54
Yeah,i've known it was magic the gathering exchange for 2 years or so
I thought it actually gave them some legitimacy ,at least they had run a business before. Unlike probably some of the other exchanges that got hacked and destroyed. Run by 18-20 year olds or illegitimates. 
@_date: 2017-02-02 20:38:28
hes not going to war soon , i dont think. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 13:19:05
I don't think you answered my point ,but anyway
@_date: 2015-01-03 18:57:00
Maybe i don't understand what you said correctly , but the increase in transactional costs is going to be infinite,so the more people join, the more those transactional costs get spread around to everyone in the blockchain. 
But after that point, the costs continue to mount beyond that.
@_date: 2014-02-24 12:47:17
i was there and saw when she wrote it ,but i was more jokingly saying ,we need - an official statement.
@_date: 2015-01-07 21:58:56
bitcoin is not fungible by definition of being able to track it , and you are an idiot if you think the bitcoin heist should not be resolved
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:45:02
Mark said what to his banker?
@_date: 2014-09-08 13:02:22
Yeah i don't get that either. Cryptos are way more inflationary than the current system.

@_date: 2015-03-03 22:19:53
or no
@_date: 2015-02-27 21:05:17
right. because bitcoin is anonymous right?
@_date: 2015-02-17 10:03:09
right. because the risk somehow changes? or because 15 additional gov departments will regulate it?

It isn't the same person ,that's what i think ,yes. But they may want to control the market, just one of them is bullish the other bearish. I don't know why people are downvoting me, maybe they should first ask me why i think that way.
