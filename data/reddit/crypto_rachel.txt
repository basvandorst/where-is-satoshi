yeah I would love another word or two :) . Can't get a good enough read off of the fonts vs size. Bruting 10 words isn't going to work anytime soon.
Way to many possibilities with no clear direction on similar letters
maybe a transcription of the letters :)

Definition of bits
    a small piece, part, or quantity of something.
    a unit of 12 1/2 cents (used only in even multiples).
Maybe you should think of how you're thinking. What's the big deal anyway. So you misunderstood what I meant. Maybe your head should have the blood instead of the small head. Obviously people around the world will read things wrong depending on where they are from. One way is never correct as there are a million ways to do or say things... It is up to the reader to interpret. Obviously you were thinking of something else
@_date: 2018-09-27 02:41:19
yeah it is still way to many options to brute force, but that is a very nice setup you have, and a smart way of eliminating the non possibilities. This is a tough one, that may be really easy with a source. I just get nowhere with any of the sources I have tried. I starting to think there might be something else to it. :)
@_date: 2018-09-22 18:36:47
r/frankybet are you affiliated with azbookmakers? Is the 6th word really ESCAPE?
 If this is a cipher based on dates like a lot of people have been thinking, there would need to be a clue for the source. There are so many sources and possibilities, that it would make the odds higher than a lottery. I can understand you may want it prolonged due to publicity, but having an unsolvable puzzle wouldn't be the best publicity.
I hope to see a small hint to help the community solve this, before all interest is lost :)

Bits as in bitcoin bits all the chunks of currency in a wallet. 
Silly, but sorry no sexual innuendo meant. ��
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:57:14
u/DoubleClickBTC ? At any point did blockchain.com have your private key, was it one of their wallets created on their system?
One should ALWAYS be in your control and only your control, especially for handling any large sum.
 Nothing is a perfect system and there is always the need for outside sources and trust (exchanges etc.) But your main bits should be held privately, then it's better than any bank or safe, and (at least right now) Unhackable.
@_date: 2018-09-23 18:03:07
**Thank you :)**  I understand. I do believe that everyone was close. I believe most have given up, if they are correct and it's a date like book cipher there are just so many sources for possibilities. I found the place for escape I think considering the two e's, just no luck with sources lining up with much other than the e's.
I look forward to the clue. luckily there will be some good puzzles for october, [ , keep us busy till then :)
If anyone is still working on this and wants to team up, Hit me up, Though it may just be luck now if we are looking for a source to decode. through all the peeps on this post, it looks like we have tried year and date sites, boxing, horse races, and even the pmids.  Chances of it being bitcoin related is unlikely since the dates go back to far.  Could have something to do with computers, but most likely sports of some type. Although so many have already been checked already.
Edit: Also just noticed a change on the [takemeback.to]( site. If it's a website it has to be immutable otherwise the data would change with time and become irrelevant. maybe a Hard book, but there would be to many to check without being narrowed down. 
@_date: 2018-09-23 06:16:19
Well there hasn't been a signed message, But That really doesn't guarantee anything.  A large sum of BTC though grew much larger over 27btc now. seems odd that it would keep growing so much, but most the transactions are from 3 or 4 address' and I didn't see any outs just a lot of inputs. it would be a nice score if it is real. Although the only hint that I saw was about paying attention to the shapes. Though u/andhiriano did respond to someone about the painting with the woman smoking maybe hash. that was basically confirmed. So likely it is a hash of the data from the shapes (whatever that could be.). :)
@_date: 2018-08-22 19:41:46
Did you see that the puzzle was pulled by the author of it. Crazy. 
Cryptogreetings got called out as a fake puzzle here. Then he pulled the funds and said it was in the randomness. And never gave solution. If it was there it would have been impossible. 
I tried the three batches of words that I found with 24 words, and any ideas that I had on what I thought yours was, however no luck. Thanks for the fun. Just to much randomness to find. Pretty good way to hide personal keys at home.

@_date: 2018-08-20 06:32:11
The creator gives his explanation here.
The creator of it says someone came close and told that person to pm for .02 consolation prize. This all seems like a con wasted many peoples time, and giving online puzzles a bad rep. After only 3 months he pulls the money from the address, when if it was as good as claimed could've lasted years. Either needed the money, and made an excuse or most likely just wasn't there, and probably sold a bunch of those paintings. Very Disappointing ��

 I just commented because my smiths had a sign out front saying as of 3/3 they won't be accepting it anymore.
I don't know if you all Expect people to read the article sometimes, (what no way to comment without reading it I guess reddit would die if that were the case, not everyone has the time to read everything) so I just made my comment from an observation I had. 
 Or maybe you expect me to know every parent company that's out there.

Maybe I'm confused, but don't we need the message, to verify the signature?
@_date: 2018-10-08 08:17:35
They are probably trying to see if the hash provides any clues
@_date: 2018-10-17 18:10:26
Hey u/frankybet , hope all is well :) I was hoping you could let us know, Was this supposed to be the final hint the hint that was supposed to solve the puzzle?
 I think that the community is stumped. I know I have tried so many combo's, that it's hard to keep track. 
Considering the Rain Man clue, I assumed it had to to with the movie somehow, so of course I watched it. I had remembered how good Ray was with dates. So I thought maybe the dates in the movie. Not enough dates in the movie. However I did note the card counting, blackjack. However I have tried various shifting methods with no avail. shifting for days of the week and month. Nothing has revealed anything. Kinda back to the book cipher style. There are way to many sources, and way to many ways to shift through the source. Obviously there are still millions of ways to shift this. Right now without more to go on, like a placement of escape, whether the puzzle is self contained, or something to narrow down the source, I don't think that this will be solved.
I appreciate the puzzle, it sure is tougher than it looked :) :) :)

frankybet confirmed on their website. everything is correct
@_date: 2018-10-10 16:12:16
I just want to say You are amazing. This Is by far the best puzzle I have seen, in my short crypto history.
Thank you so much for the opportunity, as well as the scattered prizes not mentioned ;)
@_date: 2019-03-27 07:34:04
It has been solved
@_date: 2018-10-10 16:24:12
u/bitcoin-challenge  I know your site must be be getting hit hare. I had a thought since the webpage is public knowledge, If you gave out the last 4-8 characters of the hash it would probably ease some of the traffic issues I doubt that would harm the puzzle difficulty
@_date: 2018-10-04 00:53:26
I thought the same thing. But could you imagine solving it, omg what a prize. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 09:31:05
 [u/frankybet]( so I know you said you would drop a clue at the end of the month. However there is a lot of people working on this 310 puzzle. And I'm not getting far with that. any chance for that clue, maybe a little distraction from the other puzzle :)
@_date: 2018-10-10 06:05:42
Yeah I have look at all the posts I know. I wish I knew. They probably want to keep it private. Hopefully something comes out
@_date: 2018-10-12 06:49:26
That is for creating a wallet through [blockchain.com]( via an account. Check out or [ check out [  you can enter seeds into the seed box. Or you can download electrum wallet

Doh I probably didn't see the address then. �� it's so hard keeping track of all the combos, makes the head spin. Thanks, I'll still keep my eyes out for it. Saves alot of tries. ��
@_date: 2018-06-03 06:41:50
The right seed will open the right wallet and derivation path. Cryptogreetings did say "when you have the answer there will be no doubt. It's not easy but it's absolutely possible. ..." 
@_date: 2018-06-29 01:13:09
Thought I had seen those last 3 charecters in an address I generated myself, but no luck. Did you use a derivation path like an account # 257
@_date: 2018-06-03 06:38:22
Yes possible passphrase although cryptogreetings probably took that off. Hence the address change and -1 to negate +1
@_date: 2018-06-09 08:32:07
With a brute force script and only 30 words you can get well over 10000+ seeds that ✔ sum overnight. Unless you get the right combo wallet type and all, the wallet is likely to be empty. Therefore not the right seed for the prize
@_date: 2019-08-29 19:28:18
yeah all I get is shiny bars when I try to load the article when it drops
@_date: 2018-06-03 01:52:38
If you have the seed the BTC would be gone. Unless you don't want it. How long is your seed?
@_date: 2018-06-25 20:24:35
Yes, however even if you have the right 24 words the possibilities are endless. 
Good way to lock up the funds, just like the main puzzle. Too many possibilities, basically turns a puzzle into a lottery. Still something to shoot for with bruteforce and a little luck.
@_date: 2018-06-03 23:27:22
U/Cryptogreetings, I am curious if this could be more than a 24 word seed, or do we still need a passphrase? I understand you not wanting to give much away, but i don't see any keys for hints on length in the puzzle
@_date: 2018-06-25 08:43:22
Okay, thanks atleast I'm not stumbling down the wrong path. Thank you.
 I do have a js program that someone else wrote that i have been able to re code to my needs. But no luck.
The amount of combos in just this pic blows my mind let alone the whole bip39 list. I have had the program running for close to the whole month just working on paired words. I make changes here and there hoping to get lucky but figured it's more likely to find these with the brain, looking for sentence style word seeds.
I meant js words that are also bip 39 like.  Try else help open next 
And words that had part of the code in it
add allow power define order.
That's what i got from your think like a programmer clue.
BTW Thanks for this it's a good break from the other puzzle which is starting to hurt �� you rock
@_date: 2019-08-28 17:55:57
:) your site can't handle us

The quote was "To triumph one must look within. To infinity and beyond. When you are close to home, x marks the spot." 
@_date: 2018-06-25 05:04:11
So i see that there are js program words, but not 24. Did you mean bip 39 or is there a bip38. I'm not a programmer, have only dabbled a bit, so not sure if I'm missing words since i don't know the language. Curious though if I'm on the right track :)
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:47:46
Yeah it sucks that cryptogreetings didn't give better clues. Too cryptic. It's a tough puzzle and I kinda understand since its a whole bitcoin. I hope i didn't come off as  mad, just frustrated with the main puzzle. I feel its there I think I've figured out the clues in the puzzle but still so many possibilities makes it harder than it's worth. Already put more time into than it's worth. Its been frustrating me. My apologies. 
I do appreciate this extra challenge
Since it seems you know js, I'll ask you something that may give a piece if the main puzzle up. Don't know if you've thought of this.
Is it possible to make a brute force that checks 1 of 2 signature wallets?
@_date: 2018-06-09 16:06:31
You could do that forever and not get the right address
@_date: 2018-06-03 06:18:32
You put the seed into a recovery mode of wallet
@_date: 2019-08-25 21:01:03
yeah I think we need something for  Transcription of letters  or something.
@_date: 2018-06-03 06:16:20
Well, if you have the right seed phrase, you unlock the private key which gives you access to the funds. From there you can just send them to your own address
@_date: 2018-06-09 05:06:44
Nice, thank you. He is clear in that post. That might make it a bit easier. Although another one of the posts on that site says 
"the solution (key) is contained within"
I hope its not a private key. To many possibilities. If it's a private key i expect it to take a long time.
@_date: 2018-06-08 22:56:12
It would be great if you could clarify something about the clues. I do believe the community is confused. The change in prize address with the -1 clue conflicts with the +1. Yet you said "it won't affect your progress" and all clues still valid.
 Are the +1 -1 related or separate clues?
 Are both +1 and -1 valid clues?
 Are all clues in picture still valid or does the -1 negate the picture clues?
 And can this be solved using ian colemans bip39 online tool? ( I understand if you can't answer this one.)
I really appreciate the puzzle. It is great. Probably put more time into it than a bitcoin is worth now, but I love the challenge and it's a great workout for the brain.
Thanks ��
@_date: 2018-06-09 00:07:28
I totally agree. I have thought about that a lot.  Only 3 of the things cryptogreetings said were labeled as clues
@_date: 2018-06-26 20:10:02
Yeah I hear you. I still run it though while I'm working on it myself. Hoping to win the lottery. Even though it doesn't matter. Especially since it Probably isn't setup as a single  wallet. Making it even harder to find two valid seeds that make the 1of2 sig wallet.
I think I see the Z's you're speeking of 
@_date: 2018-07-07 03:28:00
Any chance at getting another clue ��
@_date: 2019-09-02 19:07:11
I only ask because the brute for this is huge, there is no reliable font information, making a brute even larger is not knowing the actual letter u,n  d,p   b,q -- with just a few variances the amount of possible strings are huge. A transcription of the letters won't change the odds much, but atleast we would be on the right track. 
At this point I would hope a little something could be released :)

that you can convert to little endian
also at the bottom
