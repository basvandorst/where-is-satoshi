Gotcha I ended up getting a ledger anyway directly from their website. And I already put my coins in a paper wallet on a pdf on a flash drive, thanks though!

Oh wow
That's insane about the robot that should be made illegal lol. What's a stop loss?

Thanks, I used bitaddress for the paper wallet. It seemed legit enough. Thanks I'll make back ups on different drives

Bought a ledger, also, what's the difference between samourai and mycelium? I used mycelium to transfer everything to a paper wallet that I have stored on a USB drive and a data CD. Also what's the difference between mycelium and electrum for desktop?
