That’s just a very sociopathic way to think.
He might’ve invested into himself, but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t know the good parts about it.
He obviously invested in it, because he believes in it.

HODL ON THERE!
You don't come on here every minute?! The fuck is wrong with you?!
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:25:32
Not if they end up increasing the limit.
Besides, 20% would still end up at least being worth hundreds of billions of dollars!
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:28:50
I heard some rumors, but you’re probably right.
I’m glad that those slimy banks won’t be able to control this, but I also hope that they won’t try to ruin it if they can!
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:11:40
Oh, I see they’re apparently pretty similar, sorry.
I thought you were trying to “correct me” although I didn’t make a mistake.
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:07:50
He’s thinking Woz would give advice on something ONLY for personal gain and not to help others.
That sounds pretty sociopathic to me.
@_date: 2018-08-07 16:45:51
I only play EU4 and CS:GO, and the latter I play quite rarely, so I hope I’ll be spared because of my minimal use of slavery :)
@_date: 2019-10-24 18:08:47
Yeah I looked that up afterwards, I love their policy on privacy. Not only do they tumble every transaction, they even hide all transactions that aren’t yours on your wallet and they also have a bunch of other shit.
Definitely using Monero from now on.
@_date: 2019-10-22 21:18:48
FUCK. Just read the Reddit post about them being scammers, I think I lost them.
@_date: 2019-10-22 21:55:59
Yo don’t rub salt in the wound man.
@_date: 2019-10-24 09:36:50
Thank you for this brother ��
@_date: 2019-10-22 23:07:52
Not exactly, when you send it to the crypto link B, it should send it itself to C, since you give them the address they should send it to.
I’m not even sure if this shit is real though now, because I think I just got scammed.
Idk, this is how the concept works at least, do some more research and don’t be like me before you use a mixer.
Especially on the specific mixer you use.
@_date: 2019-10-23 06:07:23
Funny thing is I read 2 reviews before sending, I didn’t check to see if they were scammers specifically though.
I guess they made a fake review site or something.
@_date: 2019-10-22 20:51:31
Alright, thanks man. Also, what difference does it make if I keep using Exodus?
@_date: 2019-10-22 20:45:33
Alright man, but have I lost my BTC do you think?
@_date: 2019-10-23 07:45:51
Maybe I want to learn about how it works and not if I should use it.
@_date: 2019-10-22 20:48:29
The address I gave the mixer hasn’t changed, but the address I sent the BTC to has.
So am I probably good?
@_date: 2019-10-22 22:57:41
As far as I have understood, it basically takes a whole bunch of transactions that get sent in and mixes them up with each other so it can’t be tracked, and it makes a lot of transactions. Then when it’s done with that it sends your BTC to the address you wanted to send it to.
This process is good because it would be very hard to track it on Blockchain.
@_date: 2019-10-23 07:45:12
I read up on that, and I’m not sure how it could be anonymous, does it just not use blockchain? To me it just seems like you would be lengthening the trail.
@_date: 2019-10-22 20:57:53
They seem legit, I read some reviews before I used it.
@_date: 2019-10-22 23:00:41
For privacy reasons, there are many reasons for why you wouldn’t want someone tracking your transactions.
For example, I’ve heard of people getting fucked over by the IRS because of “unpaid taxes” because they traced some BTC to them.
@_date: 2019-10-22 20:54:53
Yo I just wanna be educated, no disrespect.
@_date: 2019-12-09 02:06:20
Yeah sure, but this looks a lot more legit than the Nigerian prince one.
@_date: 2019-12-09 00:08:33
If it was Discord, check your mutual servers.
@_date: 2019-12-08 21:50:07
You have to deposit 0.01 BTC to be able to withdraw your fake amount of BTC which is not even visible on the blockchain. This scam looks pretty legit so it could definitely fool more experienced people.
@_date: 2019-12-08 21:55:24
Why? I didn’t lose any money
@_date: 2019-12-08 22:33:21
Then it would be a lot more reliable, as it would be a hassle for them to transfer 0.3 BTC to every new account with the code. I would still check in with other users, I checked the domain and it looked pretty legit.
@_date: 2019-12-09 02:26:02
The website itself is pretty polished, when you make an account and use the code, the 0.3 BTCs appear and everything.
The strategy of rewarding users to boost your popularity in giveaways also is a real thing, so it gives you hope.
@_date: 2019-12-08 22:08:05
Nah nah, the deposit address on the account had 0 BTC even though the website said it has 0.3 BTC on it.
@_date: 2019-12-08 23:54:27
I also found the the article where Whitebit said they stole their design.
@_date: 2019-12-26 00:10:20
By using a currency that is available to you, you give it to someone who has bitcoin who in turn will give you bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-12-08 22:31:48
No problem.
@_date: 2019-12-09 00:10:19
That’s weird, might be on some username list, they sometimes appear on Russian pastebin sites.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:13:23
You see, what I don't like about this is that it has a really narcissistic and "outcasty" vibe. I don't believe bitcoin to be a special thing that most people don't understand, because everything has to be explained properly for us to be able to understand them.
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:33:53
The funny thing is that at the time I’m posting this it’s **really** close to hitting 9K again for the first time in a while.
Thanks for your sacrifice, OP!
