Pardon? A company worth $0.53 on the TSE that no one has ever heard of before is not one of Canada's largest oil and gas companies.
Edit: Whoo hoo big deal, $83 million market cap. My point here is that no one knows who this company is, let alone being one of Canada’s largest O&amp;G companies. This is click bait and false and clearly written by an American that thinks Canada is America’s hat or some stupid shit.

Yes I get how share price works. There's more factors that determine share price than what you're getting into and I don't think I need to explain my credentials to some bloke on the internet.
I'll share my edit here again because you're glossing over the big point here: "My point here is that no one knows who this company is, let alone being one of Canada’s largest O&amp;G companies. This is click bait and false and clearly written by an American that thinks Canada is America’s hat or some stupid shit."
Go get some knowledge in the industry and come back and let me know how valid the article is then.

You’re contradicting yourself. You’re telling me to quote the market cap and then shoot yourself in the foot admitting that’s tiny for an energy company. 
My point is here that this company is small fry. As an Albertan myself no one knows who the hell this company is, let alone being one of the “biggest”. Try Suncor, Enbridge, ATCO, Encana, Cenovus, Husky, Whitecap, Shell, Nexen, Imperial Oil, Spartan.
