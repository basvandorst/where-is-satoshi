Hi, We rolled out credit cards this week as a public beta. Unfortunately we've made a mistake in displaying how fees work. I'd be happy to refund your fee in the form of a credit towards future orders if you PM me your email address.
edit: we have updated our payment page to reflect the fee: [Imgur](

We apologize for the late order processing. We launched credit cards on Monday and have been overwhelmed with orders!

FYI this has nothing to do with laws. It has everything to do with fraud. for small dollars amounts the laws companies are only required to collect name, address.

we had some delays in mid december approving new customers after circle closed. subsequent orders from approved users should take 5 business days (excluding holidays). if the order lifecycle runs thru New years or another holiday it gets extended.

Hi, orders take 5 business days so 7 calendar days usually.

We have a risk system that asks the minimum amount of info upfront. For most of our users, we do not require additional info.
