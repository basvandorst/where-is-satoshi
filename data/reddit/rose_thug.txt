Why post this baseless nonsense. 
How does it help?

Talk about grasping for straws.

Hahaha holy shit you're unhinged. Look at you go little foot! 
You must be the kind of idiot that does so shit as his job he just stagnates there for a decade without accomplishing jack shit. 
Im fucking amazing at what I do, I left for more money in a better position. 
What kind of absolute cuck for life thinks loyalty to your employer will get you anywhere. 
I know youre a broke, mad, struggling bitch - just from the way you exploded from a sentence. 
It is the internet, get over yourself wanker.

Have used IR with no issues.
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:01:32
God damn, PLEASE keep this going. 
You are fucked in the head you imbecile hahaha. 
Seriously, don't stop. I will keep responding as long as I keep getting these replies. Nothing amuses me more than a broken mind.

I Literally worked in a bank for 2 years and we never handled it in "priority". 
Thats just something an entitled little shit would say.

Haha - You really take reddit seriously. 
Fuck it sucks to be you mate. Grasping at straws and always being made to look an absolute wank job of a human. 
I would reccomend taking a break from the internet and taking a walk outside - you need it buddy. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 12:42:45
Youre not wrong i was with australias biggest bank for two years and we handled them in tbe same manner.
God... every customers issue is URGENT and needs to be sorted ASAP. There really was no priority. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:16:47
Oh man, what an absolute let down. You signed off on a positive note like "Take Care"... 
I'm impressed, yet disappointed at the same time. Maybe you've finally taken your meds and some form of social intelligence squirmed it's way back into your skull for a brief moment. 
Nevertheless- You take care too Pal. 
Have a riveting 2018!

"Bitcoin Killed my Brother" 
C'mon mate. He killed him. 
Sorry for your loss. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:20:23
No doubt. I wish my lesson was a cheap one. 
Now I just accumulate and hodl until its time to sell. Could be one year could be 10. Who knows. 
Like you said, im no professional, so I hodl.

Best possible time to dump bcash for BTC. I feel sorry for thise left behind!

Who cares about karma. The same message was relayed to the sub reddit, no? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:09:29

Goes to show how much of a sham the whole education system is. This bloke should be teaching the students about its potential.
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:01:30
I thought it was a good time to sell and rebuy lower once upon a time and well.... it never really got lower...
If you can time it though, more power to you! 
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:52:40
There was certainly more that attributed to his death than being upset about BTC...
Truth of the matter is if he held onto it he probably would have sold it long before it reached 10k. He sold early anyway. 
I can sympathize with your loss and you have ny condolences. Dont blame yourselves. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:47:27
Oh sweet flower child of mine... 
If we all knew we could dump and buy at a cheaper price i think we would all do it. 
If u think you know what the market is doing. Go for gold. I learnt my lessons. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:44:11
Its hilarious that this scam ia getting so much traction. 
Paid advertising. Trying to condition people to sell at 10k. 
It wont work. Fuck you and your evil plans shilling cunt. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:44:54
You must be 15 years old... A tweet isnt proof of stake.
Fuck man 99% of this thread have no idea what theyre talking about...

What a piece of shit OP is. Playing these games all for greed. 
Con artists like him deserve to be hit by a bus. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:55:31
I think you missed the point... 
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:01:22
Its completely relative. Whatever helps you HODL at night though.
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:41:55
This makes no sense at all mate. Nobody is going to FORCE you to sell your bitcoins if you dont tell anyone they exist. 
People will cuck out to the system firat chance they get.

You should host an "emotionally invested 101" seminar. Cya Champ ��
@_date: 2018-03-25 22:51:25
How is this post not removed. What a scummy sub and mods for allowing this BS. This wont help anyone and could potentially damagr relationships, personally and professionally. 
Im not a fan of this toxic mindset. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 01:48:00
Lmao, typical. Keep up your infallible logic and foresight champion. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 06:16:01
No point in asking one of these idiots for a reason why. They are too emotionally invested in JUST bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-27 21:05:59
Love to hear why you're right, you're the one making the statement.
