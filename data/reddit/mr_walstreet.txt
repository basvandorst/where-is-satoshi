People's lives have changed drastically. It's less about media consumption and more about communication and connectivity.
Families scattered all over the place are able to communicate regularly through, IM, email, social networks, etc. Before, it was letters and the rare expensive long distance phone call. There are completely new fields of work and new types of businesses. Heck, even the claim that the internet economy collapsed is a misnomer. What collapsed was sham investment in sham companies. During the so-called "collapse" many companies became very profitable and new companies were still being formed.

You have to ask who's the dummy, the guy who starts a company that'll deliver a pack of gum for free or the guy who thinks it's a good place to invest his retirement?
The bankers didn't care because IPO's are basically a license to print money for an investment house.

The internet pays my bills and feeds me. My car doesn't.
It'd be a hell of a lot easier for me to live without my Porsche than to live without the internet
