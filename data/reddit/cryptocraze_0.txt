Currently there is no high hopes for it anymore so try to diversify 
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:15:38
Bitcoin current state is unusable as a currency , it’s only a speculative vehicle for profit making of anything.
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:28:06
No, its because Apparently peter thiel bought millions in BTC 
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:32:16
There isn’t , if they added a roadmap and a countdown shit would be pumping like crazy ( ahem cardano)
@_date: 2018-01-01 07:45:12
It’s doing nothing because there is nothing in the horizon to drive price further , lightning is vaporware and it has been for years now, I recently read a discussion between top core developers in GitHub and they are talking about lightning in YEARS time . 
If anything people will slowly allocate a little bit of their bitcoins to alts until someone finally overtakes # 1place

@_date: 2018-01-11 03:04:00
Crypto in general will move towards 10trillion mktcap
Bitcoin might not always be at the top , but it has value as a very distributed ( no one at the top ) network . No consensus on upgrades is a feature not a bug.
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:41:49
You cant spend something that hasn't even found its price. Currently cryptos are tryng to find a price/place in the world. I spend crypto all the time (buying fiat or buying other cryptos.)
Positive news come EVERY DAY, companies trying to develop their own block chains, wall street adopting this new asset class, big name companies backing certain projects ( BOCH/IOTA ) ( IBM / STELLAR) ...User adoption through the roof ( exchanges overrun)

@_date: 2017-12-09 21:34:42
Right now seems cheap as hell considering It reached 19k for a few minutes 1 or 2 days ago , it won’t drop further , I would buy it all before you even get to the exchange 
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:16:21
nah, you would probably chicken out during a crash, 
lets say amazon launches a propetary crypto that can handle 20k tx per second, and it starts to gain traction, like 700% up in a week, and you see bitcoin drop 20%, would you buy bitcoin?
This sort of scenarios are the things that could cause a crash
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:07:55
With a certain amount of money you can create your own future ;). But seriously this future shit is the lamest excuse to sell, a total government ban or a more advanced alt coin flippenning would give me something to think about not this 
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:01:06
Some dips last 2 or 3 days you will follow the price every single day and not participate in the rally’s ? 
Looking for a dip that maybe less than just buying now  
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:42:49
Buy in an all dips , if it crashes then it al goes to shit ... so what does it matter ?
Of course you have to be playing with money ,you can afford to lose in this, else you will always ask the same questions 
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:41:56
Bitcoin is going to continue growing ,
Next month I don’t know , next year definitely 
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:33:39
You are also much more prone to panic sell on borrowed money, temptation to leverage is strong but just dont, 
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:04:31
Why would they short btc now ? Better wait when it gets to 1 trillion

@_date: 2017-12-17 02:22:49
The last 2 times bitcoin dropped 80% you had this fatal events concerning non bitcoin software that went wrong.
The first bitcoin wallet failed to hold the funds
The first bitcoin exchange failed in the custody of the funds
There had to be a similar event now for the price to go that low , and you can’t predict that
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:47:33
Those address might belong to exchanges or the key is forever lost 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:30:06
I went fiat on 50%
Still have to be btc at 7k to break even 
I want to buy more iota and ethers once this bottoms out

1. yes, if you dont have or know the key to your coins, they are lost forever, thats a feature because NONE EVER can get to the coins without the key
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:44:41
Thing are worth what others are willing to pay is that simple , you are fighting millions and millions of people that value bitcoin very high telling them that they are mistaken.
Crypto community is a trillion dollar industry, the scam argument is long gone . It might be overvalued but not by much

i dont see cash taking the place of BTC; but as any coin added to coinbase a see no reason not to buy it tomorrow once prices settle, 
There is going to be a influx of newbies who coulnt care less about BTC/BCH drama

Just don’t evaluate your investments in the first day , give it at least a week haha in a week you might have double your investment with this craziness ..... or maybe after 2 years climbing this very day is the top but I don’t think so , that would be a gigantic bad luck Bryan

You are not going to be able to sell during a crash , the exchange will also crash , it has happened every time

This is going to be just like segwit2x 
Bitcoin went up like 20% in a few hours once the FUd ended. Nothing happened .
Then it crashed because bcash drama but that’s another story .
I’m doubling down on btc expecting the best after this futures FUD . why? Because if BTC crashes then it doesn’t matter anyway ‘I’ll pick cheap coins all over

@_date: 2017-12-10 03:17:18
Lol you can’t get there before everyone else , 
Exchanges would crash , you’ll be allowed to exchange only after big whales and be left with nothing , if you are in this you better have only money you can lose and expect for the best to happen. And hodl till your moon

The great thing about ledger is that your seed is always offline and your private keys are always offline so there’s no way anyone can get them
The only point of fail is you 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:17:40
its called arbitrage, and unless you can buy BTC on both exchanges (from fiat to BTC ) you cant do it,
and if you can the difference should be substantial to cover all fees and more
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:12:43
How would they do so ?

I think that the biggest challenge for bitcoin is competition , so I’ll keep a close look on iota , eth, etc. To be hedged on those 
Other than that I don’t plan to sell unless I’m in the millions

Pension funds are investing in bitcoin , big money enters the game , btc goes from 20k to 1 million in 6 months
Lightning is not ready , how much would fees be ? 
1 thousand per transaction 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:38:34
weird that coinbase is on this, they seemed reputable, but this sneaky way of launching BCH before 2018.. weird
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:54:41
few do, most of us have had great gains with bitcoin but it has to end somewhere, maybe soon enough

Or die in the hands of smarter competition , but the potential is there , just like internet boom

If you had a bitcoin wallet under your control you would be able to see all its in and outs since tx are public 
But you were storing inside coinbase so they have control

There’s just no comparison 
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:50:26
This has to be a master pump and dump strategy, every time the 2016 block adjustment is close , Minning conspiracy theories come around,  thousands of people buy the theory and pump the coin , then nothing happens and the dump comes around.making 50-60% profit for the bitcoin miners who actually know they won’t switch.
Then they can do this every 2 weeks
Why would they switch if they can keep milking this cow every two weeks!!

1. Coinbase has 2 buttons, buy and sell, vs gdax where you are seeing limit, market, graphs, positions, volumes , pairs etc, new customers only want to buy, not become day traders.
2. Coinbase wallet is popular, it is an online wallet, backed up by coinbase who is a legit company. But anyway i wouldnt store all of my coins long term there, nothing safer than cold storage, and storing your seed. You are your own bank, you trust yourself.

A lightning failure or a competitor acting faster than bitcoin will send the price to the abyss real fast 
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:35:53
I'm 50/50 on that, i think we are reaching a point where bitcoin has close competitors that can take the crown next year.. or maybe they will continue to be close seconds.. but price is definitely going up in the next 6 months.. This is like an emerging GLOBAL stock market that has barely reached 1/10th of its real potential i'll say

An electronic wallet not connected to internet in any form is safe because it cannot be subject to hackers, malware, etc.
Examples of electronic wallets: Trezor, NanoLedger,..
Thats how big whales store their coins.
But remember that you ABSOLUTELY NEED to also store the password/seed of your adress so in case of a stolen wallet or if it breaks, you can restore it. some people print the seed on a metalic plate or a plastified paper.
That would be the most safest option, 
obviously when your coin-wealth is enough that you cant afford losing it.

I think litecoin main advantage is that it is listed in most exchanges but it doesn’t really have a big tech advantage over other coins , but hey if bitcoin gets to      100k litecoin will get to 1k , just because people soul have a diversified portfolio but I don’t see bitcoin going so high without more tech scrutiny , the hype must end soon
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:21:35
1. Install a wallet in your computer, (electrum is a good choice)
2. Import the private key, 
now you can see your coins.
3. Open an account in a bitcoin exchange(coinbase, hitbtc, gemini, seem legit in USA)
4. Send your coins from your wallet to the exchange's wallet
5. exchange from bitcoin to USD and then to your bank following exchange instructions.
I will advise against it though, theres a bright future in BTC in the short-midterm
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:38:39

I see good news in the short term ( more awareness , bitcoin futures , 2nd layer, integration with software like square,atms, etc.
All of those rumors are priced in already , the effect of those ( if they are better than expected) will send bitcoin to the moon.
Bad news , I don’t know, who knows the future , USA could ban cryptos , some one hacks coinbase , that would cause a drop 
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:03:21

Currencies are not backed by anything, you would think that a government backs your usual coin but what if the government goes under, like venezuela or zimbabue, or does a shitty job administration job or doesnt repay debt like argentina.. You need a coin that does not depend on the work of elected officials.   
Bitcoin is only and purely supply and demand.
