This is not fresh problem.
Check charts, we had problem even year ago, but mostly (before now) in may - june. And now 6 months later never changed.

Exactly and again when LN came out will everyone use it? That is also problem, we believed that SegWit will be used by everyone, and now only 10% :/

Imagine someone land on moon and found it but he sad I didn't found it. People put more and more bounty and then he took everything one day :D

Also I found now that Coinbase tell more information about SegWit:
"We wanted to give our customers an update on Bitcoin Segregated Witness (SegWit) transactions: we are planning to implement SegWit in 2018."
But question is when in 2018. It need to be soon.

On the end you finish with fiat (in your laptop) and BTC.

Bcash is not Bitcoin, it's just altcoin now.

Depend on exchanger, some had then $7k (Kraken) and other ones hit it now like Bitstamp, Gemini,BTCC + Japanes and Chinese exchangers

Bitcoin is a king :)

I think that's wrong, because after 4 months dip is so small, but bigger dip 2 weeks ago you didn't calculate or on half of 3th 2 months. First dip start, secound dip start is ok but rest is hard to manage. :)

Banks don't understand that all money that go to Crpyto or go to fiat will need to go over the Bank. So they will make money whe someone do that kind of transactions.
But offcourse some smaller transactions and payment will not be over the bank anymore :D

I hope for custom fees, if that will not be available. Coinbase will set again fees 1000% bigger then needed.

If someone get in Zagreb or Split and want to visit here is addresses: 
Fee for BTC &gt; fiat is 5% (100% sure), for exchange to BTC &gt; Credit Card is about 2-3% (not 100% sure).

That was great, but fees now killing that beer so it cost probably double
