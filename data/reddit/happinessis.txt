don't know what you're talking about.
btc is well over $800 right now...
your prediction was bologna.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:05:09
It's scary.
I don't even think these people know what they're bidding on.
$255 for .1!?
That's insane

If you really don't want to see memes or sensational posts, or trading advice, then maybe r/bitcon isn't for you. Maybe try a nice **boring** bitcoin forum somewhere **off** the Internets.

It likely wont drop down to $500 today. If it does there's going to be a huge upsurge as I'm sure thousands if of people have buy orders for such a low price.
This isn't a crash.

I did the same exact thing man.
Literally looking at it nearly go below $70. I didn't buy.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:12:55
honestly. just hold.
its dropping down, but just look at those neat charts that show BTC worth since it's inception.
@_date: 2013-12-19 03:29:58
Why would I correct it for you?
It's your painting.

Dear OP,
Fuck you, you lucky fuck face. 
Just kidding.
Donate some to a meaningful charity! Lord knows, you'll have to face the wraith of the **TAX MAN**!

i don't see the triceps indicated. the major ligaments and muscles of the forearm are indicated, though not in proper orientation.
the hand is backwards?
@_date: 2013-12-15 09:54:40


For how you've indicated the position of the left arm, it would be natural for his palm to also be facing forward. Hence the mangled backwards look. 


It's just what I see. Don't be offended. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:35:09


Feel free, friend.
I'll admit I was wrong with a smile on my face. If I can buy at 500, that's bound to be a significant long term win.
@_date: 2013-12-14 21:43:47
was his left arm mangled in some kind of industrial machine?
