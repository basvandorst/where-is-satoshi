I feel as if there is almost no point in diversifying in crpyto. When bitcooin goes down, they all go down. When bitcoin goes up, they all go up.

Thanks everyone

Do I buy now or wait until its under 15k.... that is the question

This is why this is gambling, a few select people holding most of the coins will determine the future of this thing.

What % of your net worth is in cryptos? For me, it's about 2%

I reverse my statement of 10k by new years. 10k by tomorrow
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:59:05
Holy shit, please do not invest.

I purchased BTC on Coinbase on December 21, the money has been taken out of my bank account days ago, however it still shows transaction as pending in Coinbase and there's no bitcoin in my Coinbase wallet.... is this the normal amount of waiting?

Up 1000 in 2 minutes lol, this is the definition of gambling
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:30:22
Koreans when they wake up will push this back up to 16k, have faith in the StarCraft brothers and sisters.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:23:59
10k by new years
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:55:40
Gawdammnit I put in $3000 about an hour ago at $14,500, should've waited a bit more
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:51:39
I put $2000 in when the price was 15k lol.... I have no choice but to hold lol. I understand there is some chance I may never profit from this even if I hold for years.
