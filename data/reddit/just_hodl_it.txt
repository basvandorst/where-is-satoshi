You're talking about the news from before about raiding the exchanges which is the one posted from OP...
This actually is a completely different story.
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:58:33
It's often like that, especially in unregulated markets.
As you say, time will tell, just trying to inform people, also thanks for your input.
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:03:34
ehm... you know about this, right?
This actually is the news affecting the markets.
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:04:11
Some of you guys have serious problems...

I used the exact same title Reuters had, which they now changed and probably will even change further.

I mean, the posts are there :D
But as long as you can't tell anyone where in the first post the 890,48 are you are a typical btc shill that all he does is being a liar.
Please continue.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:26:44
Just check yourself how he did the biggest mistake using different amounts. Just compare it. 890,48 is nowhere in the first post, which actually should be.
Continue believing the lies some shills tell you.

You did not buy at 13'800 on Coinbase.

Comparing this to a Bloomberg Terminal?! :D Please...

Continue downvoting me.
Typical BTC shithead shill that just got into cryptos, or i should say btc shit.
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:33:45
Nice photoshop, forgot to use the correct amount posted in main post.
Also, it shows @ and current price and not $ amount.
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:01:18
Wow, the only thing you can do is throwing words around without even providing anything. You BTC Shills are hilarious, seriously.
Tell us, BTC shill and liar, where is the 890,48 in the first post?
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:34:39
3.96 Euros which is about 4,6$

@_date: 2017-11-14 19:24:13

@_date: 2018-02-01 10:02:23
Shut up and continue going up and down!
@_date: 2018-04-21 07:03:59
Seems like you're retarded as fuck, as you can see in the post it clearly shows what has now happened.
