Can someone explain to me how one of those wallets works? If it's offline how do you 'broadcast' to the network?

I think any theory trying to proof that would be sloppy and rely on so many chance factors ("IF Gavin Andresen was renditioned") as to make it VIRTUALLY impossible. I'm not that worried about the syntax I just felt like commenting for the sake of precise language (The Giver, anyone?). It's cool though.

Bitcointalk.org is something I've never considered for buying coins. I'll exploit it. Thanks for the tip.
What do you mean by 'to separate it from the masses'?
@_date: 2013-07-04 15:04:03
Thanks. You're comment goes a long way in terms of clarity.

Just be on the look out. And exercise your right to upvote/downvote OFTEN.

Too be fair people who watch that video and DON'T think that, even for a second, should also be disallowed to reproduce.

The idea sounds nice. But in practice, through this platform...
@_date: 2013-06-27 00:53:54
It wasn't always like this. I think the entire subreddit is being sockpuppeted, like how livememe was auto-upvoting their own website on and downvoting the competition. Some entity is making us look bad. I used to come here every day when the price was above at $120/btc and the conversations were always reasonable and insightful. People who didn't get it were downvoted, crazies were marginalized, and the most insightful comment would be found at or near the top. 
I stopped checking as frequently as the price started dropping because I felt less incentivized: that I would miss some big news and miss getting in before a price jump. That was 2 weeks ago.
Call me paranoid (many have) but something sinister is going on. Someone is using the upvote system to make it look like there are more crazies and less rationals than there really are. I'm gonna make a post about it.
@_date: 2013-06-27 03:16:38
You're right. It was quickmeme or something.
@_date: 2013-07-06 14:21:57
Well I guess you should use your language more precisely in the future and be careful around pronouns

I doubt anything I write on Reddit is going to magically change the shirt or otherwise ruin it. And I doubt the guy who made and paid for the shirt cares much about the grammar. [So tell me again how I ruined the shirt.](

I've come to the same conclusion that true anonymity would be achievable through a disconnected, untracked wallet change.

Yeah. I think the same thing.

I was with you until this part which makes absolutely no sense.

Hi, this is pretty cool. Nice site. Nice design. Good infrastructure.
My username: 
@_date: 2013-06-27 14:49:15
Who said anything about selling, idiot? I mentioned buys though. I buy when the conditions on the ground, evaluated through multiple sources (Reddit IS an aggregator) tell me the market is about to undergo a change. It's been really hard to get Bitcoin lately, even for me. So we haven't been seeing upwind lately. That's also due to the lack of hype about new additions. 
I had a really hard/expensive time getting coins through localbitcoins and bitinstant has become only the second most obtuse vendor in the ecosystem. Seriously, is not an adept businessman. Adopting a new way to verify but don't explain it on your front page so everyone knows the deal. You need to usr your real name and address or the site will appear completely broken; this no doubt turned away a lot off privacy conscious people who think THEIR information is none of YOUR god damn business. And the round have no idea why they are getting turned away at the gate, money-in-hand. 
This is just one of the many things that can be improved in Bitcoins nascent infrastructure and whoever does it well not only save the world but get tons of business in the process.

This thread: 
After noticing how fucked up the balance of crazy to reaonable I made an effort to upvote the 0 comments back to 1 and downvote the guy saying every nation was going to issue it's own cryptocurrency and peg it to the bitcoin (which got EIGHTEEN upvotes). Beyond that I have no immediate examples.
@_date: 2013-06-27 05:01:59
I would, currently, GLADLY accept bitcoin for my labor. It would save me a ton in fees since I'm already converting all of my income into bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-06-30 01:23:39
I don't understand why you've been downvoted. Is that site disreputable or something?
@_date: 2013-06-27 01:37:28
Thanks. If you don't think there's anything going on I'm inclined to trust you. My gut just said something was up and that we, were being made to look bad and that I should bring it to the community attention. It has been a while since I last checked in regularly. I've been lurking post titles and clicking ones I found interesting (new company accepting bitcoin, government-bitcoin action) but beyond that I've been ignoring the comments. 
Man I remember the days when this subreddit would be full of healthy speculation and discussion about the future. But I guess that comes and goes with the hype. I wasn't around before the last 'bubble.' I still think that something like what I alluded to in the original post is a possibility but I don't think it is currently happening.
@_date: 2013-07-03 18:50:59
Dude. You're a humongous tool and your Bitcoin site is **unprofessional** and ill-managed.
@_date: 2013-06-26 19:52:44
I agree. Anyone who can buy groceries with Bitcoins, has a landlord who accepts Bitcoin, and a utilities service who will pay their bills in exchange for Bitcoin (which assumes they (the service entrepreneur(s)) too can do non-business stuff with the currency) will have little reason to make the exchange back to Euros/Dollars. I think it's just a matter of time before that kind of infrastructure is covered by mainstream media and adopted by mainstream people. This is how societies get built. And even Rome wasn't built in a day.
@_date: 2013-07-05 13:48:23
Yeah. That's exactly right. 
@_date: 2013-07-01 13:42:52
They don't hurt. They build community interest. They inform Merchants of interest community interest. Sometimes they work and sometimes the seed I'd planted. Like inception a CEO sees a Bitcoin segment or article and goes to his CIO or CFO and starts asking questions or they go to him.
@_date: 2013-06-27 15:00:11
Oh yeah, I'm very bullish on bitcoin. I think it's going to be huge. I imagine there will be a new aristocracy made up of early adopters and the old mainstream superrich. There will even be new extremes of wealth. Me? I'm just looking forward to the opportunity to form start-ups that work with my interests, an intersection of technology and medicine (maybe biotechnology/prosthetics), and helping causes that are important to me, like hunger in America.
That that is a subreddit disturbs this one deeply.

I pay my taxes and social security upfront and my partner pays for most things. That I can't find a Bitcoin alternative for. He sees the world-changing value of Bitcoin and supports me in my decision. We think it's going to pay off.

Oh, well I don't pay that much attention to subreddit drama. I ain't got time for that. But I didn't skim it. Maybe it was quickmeme (...?) I i was thinking of.

I didn't say it was VAST. It would take literally, like one government employee with time and a socks proxy.

He said PIN number. Which is redundant. Because PIN means Personal Identification Number. Personal Identification Number number.

Hey, sorry for calling you batshit-crazy and I appreciate the response. Given context, your idiosyncrasies seem less crazy. I've only watched maybe 3 minutes of a bitcoin conference on youtube and that was someone making a wild prediction that proof-of-work wouldn't survive the end of the year so I hold little truck with the reliability of the things said there. Though I've never been to a conference.
I agree that bitcoin will either be moon or bust. But I think the only possible way it can bust is if America and the governments that depend on the dollar's status start managing their currencies properly. Which isn't going to happen. The incentive structure is there for bankers and politicians to gut the system in a cash-hungry moneygrab and that isn't going to change...until cash becomes worthless. Enter bitcoin.
Other subreddits are exciting in their own way. This is the only subreddit I would imagine that gets the kind of userbase that has a vested interest in the appearance of it's own userbase and their ideas. I'm suddenly remembering that it's summer and maybe the crazies are out of class. Things get a little helterskelter during the summer months when the kiddies are out.
When you're not saying emphatically that every nation is going to issue its own cryptocurrency you're actually pretty likeable. Like I said before this isn't an issue that reddit sees a need to solve. Vote distribution isn't a concern on something like No one there is crying foul and calling out defamation of cats. Then again who would ever defame a cat?!
@_date: 2013-07-04 15:26:25
I think what differentiates other coins from bitcoins is the investment in infrastructure. The bitcoin network is now faster than every supercomputer in the world combined. That's amazing. People have invested thousands in their rigs. (some hundreds of thousands). They have a vested interest in this coins usage as opposed to ltc. It's got backers and VC interest and its adoption and technology is *growing*. That is what distinguishes it from Litecoin.
@_date: 2013-06-27 14:40:06
I think you have the truth of it. I consider myself pretty knowledgeable about Bitcoin. Perhaps not depth but breath and I at least know if the things I don't know in depth and I don't comment and lurk as much as I used to; back when most posts were about getting X company to accept Bitcoin and not just the latest BFL dividend out what have you. 
@_date: 2013-07-04 18:47:54
I get what you're saying. The idea you're putting forth isn't exactly *new* though.
