I needed the transaction to confirm within the hour.  If I had 12 hours to wait, you are correct - I could have lowered the fee and took a gamble.  But If I need it in one of the next 3 blocks - it's gonna be pricey.  At the time I was competing with 50K other transactions, so this is to be expected that it was not going to be cheap.
I have paid $92 before because of a 1700 byte transaction at 700 sats per byte I believe...and that was the day I decided, I am kind of done with the 1MB limit.  
And no I wont use Segwit because of how it changes bitcoin.  Did you hear about the guy that took all the BCH from Segwit addresses?? I mean really???
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:44:03
Don't move your bitcoin - 2 weeks ago I paid 0.002 BTC fees to move it.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:40:18
I freed $10 from my posession with my last bitcoin transaction due to the fees.  Sorry, Bitcoin is not going to do jack as long as it has these ridiculously high fees.

Every single argument in this thread has been made 10 times before since 2015....back when there was 1 bitcoin back when bitcoin had 95% of marketcap.  So now we want larger blocks?  Didn't we have a chance to get 2MB like a month ago?

Segwit was a 4MB softfork.

BTC is not meant to be transfered, but a store of value....hold on to it.

It is a simple answer which has been soundly rejected by the BTC community.  That's why BCH exists in the first place.  If BTC had even increased Size to 1.5MB there would not be a BCH.

What do you plan to use Bitcoin for?
@_date: 2018-05-01 15:53:54
I promise you I own more BTC than you do.  I also I own BCH.  This is not a race war.  Its not a religion.  You absolutely *can* support more than one coin.  Although I disagree with the direction of BTC, I think its borderline incompetence to advocate 0-conf acceptance of BTC where RBF is a feature.
@_date: 2018-05-02 22:44:07
It's not an attack.  With 0-conf BTC I can pay my bill walk out 5 miles away and do a RBF transaction.  Done.  
Of course, I can't do this with my dentist or barber who knows me.  But if someone wants to rip-off a restaurant - it's that easy.
But don't argue with an idiot like me - if you think BTC has 0-conf then wow, you just single-handedly disproved one of the biggest proported benefits of BCH vs BTC - congratulations!
@_date: 2018-05-01 00:54:02
Yes, but a shoplifter has at least a chance of getting caught.  With RBF a person will drive 5 miles away and replace-by-fee (RBF) their (now free) lunch.  Please do not encourage people to use 0-conf on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-05 23:11:46
There is no more scaling debate.  If you want off-chain scaling, you use BTC.  If you believe in on-chain scaling you use BCH.  There should be no more debate.  Let each chain play out the experiment to see who was right.  
@_date: 2018-10-05 23:10:38
Antpool can stop signaling that a block is theirs.  How will you identify Antpool then?  Bitcoin was designed to be permission-less and resistant to the exact kind of shenanigans you are suggesting.

What is safe about a hack that makes older clients 'compatible' by confusing them into thinking segwit transactions are *anyone* can spend?  Yes, they are safe as in nobody can steal them - but this is a software hack.  This is not how we need sound world money being developed.

So the joke is "Use Bitcoin - its not any more expensive than VISA" ?
@_date: 2017-08-10 01:37:54
I personally do not believe it is good.  But high fees and small blocks go hand-in-hand.  I would like to know a good answer to this.  
However, if someone's goal is to get high fees by enforcing small blocks, why not leave the blocks alone and just code the high fees in.
@_date: 2018-10-09 17:52:47
Financial transactions that need to be taken as truth in a trustless decentralized fashion require everyone who is voting to be aware of all other transactions.  You simply cannot validate transactions without knowing the history of all transactions (in a system that allows everyone to to be able to send to anyone else).  
The internet is not an immutable ledger where only one version of it is valid - therefore it is not needed for everyone to treat it like a bitcoin blockchain.  
@_date: 2017-08-10 21:32:41
True.  "bitcoin cash" will be BTC soon.
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:51:54
Custom fees might help, but really when demand for block space is high and block space is low, expect high fees.

I am glad everyone is happy and all, but what I am I supposed to do with a coin that costs me $5 to move?
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:28:02
If you don't understand bitcoin and have all your life's savings in there - you are in for a very bad ride.
There is absolutely no guarantee that bitcoin will be the top coin in the coming years.  Diversify.
Also you really need to be able to walk away relatively unharmed if you lose 100% of your investment.  
And if you are shaking scared - thats a really bad sign that you might panic sell or panic buy.  Once you have bought in - you need to HOLD.
I have investment in BTC, ETH, BCH....assuming one of these 3 becomes king, I am ready to watch my other 2 stacks turn to dust - I will NOT sell them.  Cuz I know that once BCH is $10k and BTC $5 - and I sell BTC, that's exactly when BTC will turn it around and go to the moon.
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:25:45
I think better advice is do not panic sell.  Hold.  The price will go down, but it will come back up.  Every time I tried to convert to something else and back, I've lost at least 20% value.  Do not move.
Of course if you are 100% in bitcoin, this is bad.  I personally buy BTC, ETH, BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:21:48
If you are going to fight the good fight, at least do it with good data.  Otherwise you are just fooling yourself.  The few futures I looked at are incredibly biased against B2X chain - as in if things dont work out, B1X folks get their money back, B2X are SOL.  Futures like that means people like me stay away.  You are getting skewed data.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:46:28
Bitcoin, for now, is only good for buying and holding.  Also, if you need to send lots of money to a foreign country - Bitcoin is good for that as well.  For everything else, the fees are too high and if you put reasonable fees then the wait times are too high.
Bitcoin for all practical purposes right now is not usable for anything except for holding.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:13:19
I hate to say it, but I think I might have attacked bitcoin a handful of times in the last few days as I moved coins from hitbtc to my ledger.  I am sorry.

If you plan to only hold BTC Trezor is very good.
But I also hold Bitcoin Cash.
How their CEO responded to criticisms of using the term "bcash" really left a bad taste.  I own 4 Trezors - but moved to Ledger Nano S after that debacle.  I don't want to feel my coins could in any way be compromised because of personal opinions of the people who make my wallet.

Sorry - Terrible advice.  Do not try to outsmart / time the market.  None of us know when the dip and ath occurs.  Buying and selling hopeing to make a profit in between is just about the quickest way see your investment slowly evaporate.

That's how I feel about Segwit.  When even Bitcoin developers argue whether its a blocksize increase or not - no thanks, its too damn complicated.
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:22:59
Put all the scaling proposals in a hat all 3-dozen.  What you will realize is that every single one of them needs more than 1MB or 2MB or 4MB of blocksize to reach 100's of millions of users.  Why we split bitcoin in to three coins over a 2MB blocksize is why I became disillusioned with the old guard and welcome the new reality in November.

Don't listen to anyone who tells you to sell and buy back.  JUST HOLD! And if you are betting on the SX1 or SX2 chain, dont do that either.  by your own words this is your family's savings - be conservative and do not be greedy - greed is what will kill you.
Just buy and hold.

Protect yourself by not keeping more than a few hundred dollars in the wallet you use for spending.
It breaks my heart that there will be a lot of people who will lose a lot of coins because they can't do math in their head or make a simple mistake.  Not seeing what units their wallet is set to they will end up sending 10x, 100x, 1000x of what they meant to send.

You have to diversify.  Nobody can predit which coin will be king - BTC, ETH, or BCH.

Segwit2x does not eliminate (ie ban) input from core developers.  If anyone doesn't like segwit2x and decides to remove themselves from its development, that is perfectly their right.
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:38:33
Well they can have all the power they want and change the protocol any way they wish - its called a fork.  And people can follow whatever fork they agree with.  I personally don't believe 1MB (non-segwit) blocksize is nearly big enough.  Because I like 2MB more, I will follow the Segwit2x.  
There is no fear that governments will get to the CEOs and destroy bitcoin, because if the protocol is ever changed to something I dont agree with, I wont follow it.  It is that simple.
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:27:08
If a coin depends not just on developers but a PARTICULAR set of developers to survive, it should not survive.

Well, if we had 2MB blocks a year ago, there would be still one bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-29 21:31:00
Would you call it a take-over if it was a change you agreed with?
It looks like miners want bigger blocks (not segwit big blocks, but native big blocks).
@_date: 2017-09-29 20:37:21
Communities have to react when one side believes that 2MB blocks will kill bitcoin while the other side believes Segwit will kill bitcoin.  Its awesome that the split is happening and each side can be free to take their ideas with them.

Can somebody explain how we can have LN that servers 10's of millions of users and still have 1MB block?  And before you dive into the Segwith weight math - consider that since this segwit was a soft-fork, it means that old nodes still accept these blocks - which are limited to 1MB.
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:43:50
As an investor, I try to buy of everything - I even have some ripple even though I dont even consider it a cryptocurrency.
I honestly dont understand why people think playground namecalling will convince anyone.  It completely undermines your credibility because you are spewing emotionally not logically.
Why I like Bitcoin Cash is that it does not have Segwith and it has 8MB blocks...this aligns with my belief of how scaling should happen - it is that simple.
I own both bitcoin and bitcoin cash cause I do not know which one is going to win out.

How does blocksize doubling put companies in charge and fire open source community?  You explained the 'what' will happen - but what is the 'how'.  If 1x didn't do it, why would 2x do it?  Its just a blocksize doubling - nothing more.  People deciding they would rather not work on 2x and firing themselves is their right.
@_date: 2017-10-16 23:42:40
I can see where you are coming from.  [Satoshi did in fact envision mining pools and asics](
If there is a way to enforce 1 cpu = 1 vote, then my friend you are looking at being an extremely wealthy and influential person.  And if you share this scheme with me, I will do everything in my power to help it come to reality.
And as you know, we cannot trust (in a trustless peer-to-peer cash system) the miners to not take advantage of anything that they can.  So asking them nicely to please use 1 cpu for 1 vote will not work, for as long as even ONE miner decides to cheat, they will have an advantage over everybody else and system collapses.
So the next best thing is hashpower = voting power.  And if you don't like that a rich person has more influence over things, well I cannot think of any system on this planet (without an authority figure) where the rich dont have more influence than the average person.  
Until then what you are asking of miners is IMPOSSIBLE.  Its not that we don't want miners to have 1 cpu = 1 vote, I think that is IDEAL.  But so is free ice-cream for everyone on earth - its a nice thought, but its simply impossible.
Like I said, you figure out a way for miners to use 1cpu 1vote without ability to cheat, and you got yourself a new coin!
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:26:03

@_date: 2017-09-28 16:29:14
I understand the weight vs size stuff...but what I dont get is because old nodes can still accept segwit blocks (definition of soft fork) - isn't there still a 1MB block hidden under all the weight stuff regardless? and the limit of that block is still 1MB - because it HAS to be accepted by nonsegwit nodes?
@_date: 2017-10-16 23:50:12
In this thread I had 2 conversation with different users that did not know that 
a) Satoshi envisioned mining pools and asics back in 2008/2009, 
b) Satoshi wrote pseudo code on how to increase the blocksize gracefully

The transaction went through really fast actually.  I paid 240 satoshies per byte (coinbase chooses that for you).  But Normally I wait for the weekend so the backlog is less than 10,000.  This is the first weekend in recent memory where I did not (by choice) initiate the transfer because the backlog was 8x that!
It came down to like 40,000 yesterday and I moved my coins.  240 sat/byte and it was very very fast.

How to you respond to the calculation that says even with LN, every user needs to have 1 onchain tx to settle - and in reality many more than that (minimum 14 onchain txs) to keep LN decentralized.  With 1MB blocksize this severely limits the number of users LN can support.
It seems to me, even with LN you need much larger block sizes to support hundreds of millions of users.
