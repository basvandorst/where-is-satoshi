Can confirm, at freaking work today. UGH!! Doing usual morning routines of crypto reading/researching.

Buy more now while you can. Lock that price in

I hear this word opportunity has many connotations. Mostly it's a word when I need to get my poop in a group

Lot of those same coins can also be bought with ETH though.

282% increase today for Bitcoin cash. Is that unheard of? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:11:59
Yes, I did avoid fees to the wallet but out of the wallet is pricey. I'll wait it out

I got 200 usd in a few days ago around 16.4. pretty exciting to follow this crowd and see money grow. I won't see my BTC for a few days but my locked in rate is a good bit lower. I plan to have reoccurring buys here and there but I'm tempted to pull out the credit card but know I probably shouldn't.

Same here! Wtf

What's advice on going to do something like ripple now? Wait for a dip? Seems like getting money to binance takes awhile. If crypto is going to take off, they need to figure that out to get your $ to an account to buy at a moment's notice
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:16:23
You guys are good at calling this. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:58:58
I transferred money to binance a few hours ago and nada. Glad it was a tiny bit. Starting to think it's going

I'm new and realized that transferring from a wallet to an exchange is really expensive. Like 50 is what I'm seeing. I'm thinking it may be a good idea to just forget about what is in the wallet and let it sit and play with new money. Anyway to pull to an exchange from a wallet without paying a ton?
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:08:16
When you say break resistance or set up walls, what does that refer to?
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:50:49
Yea, but fees to an exchange from a wallet kinda sucks. Anyway around that? I read somewhere not to deal with moving to a wallet unless you have more than 1 BTC
@_date: 2018-10-02 14:47:19
I think most if not all came to make some money. If this has taught me one thing, it's to pull out early. Actually, I've learnt that before but I don't apply it to everyday things. Pull out will be my next tattoo!!
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:42:16
Wouldn't it be better to buy in at a cheaper price? I do it all the time with alts to gather more coin
@_date: 2018-02-24 01:27:43
I'm waiting this one out. Jumped too soon on the last dip and screwed myself. Probably should just hodl but.....
@_date: 2018-02-18 05:48:51
Where do you see 11?
