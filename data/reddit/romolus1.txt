This was super informative! Thanks for the explaination and the resources!

Because average fees from Segwit addresses are lower than non-Segwit ones, so in a total-Segwit environment we would have less transactions stuck driving the average fee down. It's all about the network congestion right? While it's bad for users, it's more profitable for miners.. Am I getting this correctly?

Thanks for the explaination! So while Segwit adoption is good for users, it can be bad for miners right?

I have a slow connection and the image just slowly unfolded from top to bottom, making it more magic. Much science behind this solid ratings

From a technical point of view, what determines the size of a block? I mean I know it's the number of tx, but how is decided how many tx are put in a block? I'm just referring to these recent 2mb blocks, why are they achieved only now and what made them possible to be that big? Thanks for the answers!

That's what is gonna happen until they decide it's over scamming people.. Already broken 1800 tho
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:42:32
Already over? Meh

Anyone saying this isn't some sort of attack is covering his eyes from reality.

Not denying the actual problems of BTC, but this shit happened in early november. Same exact thing. High fees etc. And calling it an "attack" may be exagerating but it's the best term to describe what's going on, since it's what BCash dudes wanted and stated from the beginning.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:12:03
Because it has been the purpose of BCash since the beginning and they always declared that, Ver in primis. They want to replace BTC, I'm not saying it, they are. And just look at /btc to see how many news and stuff came in the hot page about Bcash. I call an "attack" something coordinated and orchestrated carefully. Why all the pump, all news and all the stuff coming out right NOW? I mean it's so obvious from a strategic and realistic point of view that it's ironic so many people are falling for it, but the most ironic are experienced holders denying this. BTW I only own LTC, so it's not that I'm one of those BTC fanboy believing in their dreams.
Not only, I experienced the SAME EXACT thing in the early-november BCash pump, that day I was still holding some buck in BTC. And it was so fake that it's ridiculous.

Its volumes are nothing compared to Bithumb or Bitfinex and the average btc volume traded so I wouldn't be sure about that. Maybe played a role, but being the cause.. Well.. Can a fly kill an elephant? No, but it can annoy it.

Yeah only speaks of it in the description of the video

Yep, on GDAX the 18k to 19k range is almost clean of sells. Normally this would be wiped out in minutes... You'll never know how much you'll be trolled tho

I think they have enough wealth to start it, the market will do the rest as you said. But isn't this manipulation?
If not of the majority, at least of many..
Not understanding what is your point tho, how you explain what is going on now. Or maybe in your opinion is that's not happening anything at all?
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:52:25
Crypto-bashing on a whole new level.
This is more like Bitman's "dirty secret" instead of Bitcoin's one.
Energy consumption is still a big issue and important topic tho, until we totaly convert to renewables.

What if they pump again "VerCoin" so much that again is not profitable anymore to mine BTC? That would last too many days.. It's almost morning in China/Korea and in 10 hours ca. they are gonna upgrade the BCH. I know it should not be called a coup, and that BTC has already seen this milion times, but at the same time this one is different and driven by some shady forces we are not completely aware of. I dunno, and I'm NOT saying to panic sell or stuff, and I'm sure BTC will hold and shoot the other in the face.. But maybe it's time to get aware of some kind of "war" and act.

Again spamming with Alt propaganda...
