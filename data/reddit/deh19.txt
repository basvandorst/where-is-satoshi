My Revolut account has been blocked for security reasons after depositing money and verifying my debit card. I've tried contacting customer support on Revolut, to no avail. Has anyone had this problem and had it solved?

I did the exact same as you first time round via debit card.
I've followed the advice from others here. I'm attempting it this way:
Coinbase -&gt; Revolut -&gt; Nationwide
The money in my Coinbase account will hopefully be in my Revolut account by Friday. 
Will update this thread when I get it into my Nationwide account. 
Hope this helps.

Yeah, this works, apart from the fact that I haven't received my initial deposit back

Which steps do I need to follow to withdraw from Coinbase -&gt; Revolut-&gt; Nationwide? 
Have you got a link please?
The first deposit I did via a debit card deposit to Coinbase and the second via a SEPA (which didn't work and I haven't received my money back).
Feels like my money from the debit card deposit is stuck in Coinbase at the moment!

Did you deposit via SEPA transfer or debit card deposit?

For anyone with funds stuck in Coinbase and have received an email from Coinbase saying the money would be returned within 1-2 days, this is the response I received from Nationwide:
"However, the funds then get returned to our agent banks holding account. When a payment is received back into this holding account it becomes difficult to locate and as such can cause delays in the funds being received back into your Nationwide account. Although your details would be on the full remittance slip available to the bank the company uses they do not seem to be able to locate these details.
 
If they have stated they returned the payment, please ask for the MT103/202 of the returned payment so we can investigate the payment."
So it continues...

Have '1-2 days' passed for you? I only tried to deposit a smaller amount, but still I don't know if Nationwide or Coinbase have the money!

No. Tried a transfer via a SEPA payment. This was declined and I was told the following:
We appreciate your interest in Coinbase! However, we're unable to process your recent deposit for €X EUR sent on 2017-12-11 because:
The name on the bank account does not match the name entered on the Coinbase account.
These funds will be returned back to the sending bank within 1-2 business days.
Suffice to say, I've not seen any funds returned.
Also if they are returning the money to my bank, 
wouldn't they need SWIFT/IBAN number of my bank before Coinbase return my funds?

I've been waiting since the 12th of December, it was refused as supposedly my 'details did not match', 
I'm now waiting to see my money again after Coinbase saidmy funds would be returned within 1-2 days... that time period has already gone.
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:42:59
Did your transfer go through before/after the message?

Tried to transfer £50 from Nationwide to Coinbase.
Now that money has just disappeared, with no helpful response from Nationwide. Coinbase have said the money will return to my bank within 1-2 days, this hasn't happened.
I have additional money in my Coinbase account that I want to withdraw, how should I do it? 
Why is it so difficult...
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:11:18
I've tried that many times to get an unautomated response, now I'm also stuck with money in my Coinbase account as they don't accept Nationwide deposits so I'm not risking a withdrawal..
Should I switch banks?

Tried a transfer from Nationwide Building Society via a SEPA payment. This was declined due my details not supposedly being correct.
I was told the following:
"We appreciate your interest in Coinbase! However, we're unable to process your recent deposit for €X EUR sent on 2017-12-11 because:
The name on the bank account does not match the name entered on the Coinbase account. These funds will be returned back to the sending bank within 1-2 business days."
