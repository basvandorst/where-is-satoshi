Problem may be if the time between sending the transaction is very small. If the transaction isn't known by most miners yet,  it's not really realistic to expect the transaction to be included,  no matter the fee.

That's because your country has a crippled payment system. In a lot of countries (at least in mine), it isn't necessary to go out the house to send money, and you can send money instantly and free from person to person. And with these solutions you don't have the drawback of exchanging between two currencies. And yes it's centralized, but the vast majority of the people don't give a shit.

As someone else posted here already, renting a computer with internet access in Uganda costs $0.10 - $0.25 per hour.

The fact you get downvoted is what's wrong with this sub. Everbody here should realise bitcoin is a very risky (but possibly high reward) investment. You could call it a gamble. I don't think it's the right time for the Greek population to start gambling. If I where Greek,  I would make sure I have enough cash and maybe some precious metals. Only if I have some money left I can afford to lose I would buy some bitcoin,  just as I'm doing right now. 
Pushing the Greek to buy a lot of bitcoin is selfish.

I know a lot of expensive things which aren't very useful.
In the extreme case where you and me bought all the bitcoins and are hoarders. I'm willing to sell just one bitcoin, but only if I get one trillion USD for it. In effect, bitcoin price would be 1 trillion USD/BTC. But nobody even thinks about buying. Has bitcoin succeeded in this case? I don't think so...

There's certainly good news. But it's not causing a major influx of new users. It seems currently there are more bitcoins created every day than there are bought. Simple as that. 
TimeInc accepting bitcoins does not cause thousands and thousands of people to suddenly buy bitcoin, unfortunately. But have patience. The infrastructure is being built. When there is either for some reason a big influx of new users, or the rate new bitcoins are created halves (in 2016), we will be ready for it :)

The same, but in data: 
@_date: 2014-09-05 07:19:58
Average inflation in my country of the last 3 years is 1.976%.
I don't know where you live, but if you have an inflation of 300-500% over ten years, your country has some serious issues. 
If you're living in the US, it is about 2% too: 
You can't just pick a product you know increased in price a lot, and calculate the inflation rate out of that. In the same way I could look at the price of hard disk space. 10 years ago the average price was $1.38/GB. Now it is about $0.03/GB. Wow, that's deflation rate of about 30% a year!
@_date: 2014-06-11 10:02:25

Yes, but if the only place your bitcoins (in fact the private keys) are stored, is on a USB stick, I would advice to have some paper backup of them. USB sticks can fail. Bitcoin is *backupable* money. Make use of it ;)
Thanks for the tip, BTW :)

I don't get why in some posts I read "Bitcoin is by design not fit for microtransactions" and in other posts "Bitcoin is good because with microtransactions...".
Quote of Satoshi himself:
Bitcoin isn't currently practical for very small micropayments. Not for things like pay per search or per page view without an aggregating mechanism, not things needing to pay less than 0.01. The dust spam limit is a first try at intentionally trying to prevent overly small micropayments like that.
I know it would be possible with payment providers and off-chain transactions, but this has then nothing to do with Bitcoin. It's something Paypal/CC's could use as well.

What about mortgage registration? Where I live, I have to pay to register my mortgage with the government. That's just adding some info in their database. They don't provide any services on that (it's my bank which is providing the service). But I have to pay VAT on that...
There are several other examples of "services" which or nothing more than adding an entry in a database, for which you have to pay VAT.
Don't get me wrong: I really don't think VAT should be paid, when buying bitcoin. But I don't think the reason for that is that it's just an entry in a database. I'm pretty sure there are other services where you just pay for an entry in a database, and you have to pay VAT. For example when you buy an account (without support) for some website or game.

Indeed. As long as you're not doing it professionally and are holding your bitcoins long enough, it's tax free.
If you're not doing it professionally but are buying and selling on a short time frame (days, weeks), you have to pay 33% taxes on your profits.

Not sure about that. I know many people my age (mid twenties) who would not be able to securely store their own bitcoins. They are not "dumb" people. Just not tech-savy.
People can't secure their PC from viruses or even keep their browsers clear of toolbars. But you trust them to store their bitcoins them self?
@_date: 2014-06-09 12:34:21
I get the idea. I guess it all depends on the number of coins and the situation of the user. My paper wallet is encrypted with a reasonable long password (not words). The number of coins in it is small enough that when I die, my family will not worry about those coins. And I think if I get in an accident or something it's more likely I forget I have bitcoins than I forget the password :D
For me, a paper with the password would be something else I can lose. The paper wallet itself is already in the few places I'm pretty sure I won't lose it, so I can't store the password in the same place(s)...
But yeah, it all depends I guess. I think OP will understand the pros and cons of a 12 word password after reading this discussing, so he can decide for himself :)

I think your phone counts as "rooted" too. On a stock Android, it's not possible to run anything as root. You have to exploit a bug in the OS to do that. I can't run some apps because my phone is "rooted", although I never granted root-access to these apps.

We need to know the price to produce the most efficient ASIC with current technology. If we (porbably wrongly) assume the attacker could produce all of these in a short timeframe and powers them on all at the same time, so the difficultly has no time to adapt, we just have to divide 250 PH by the hashrate of this most efficient ASIC and multiply with its price.
And elektricity cost too... :)
This will be a very high number... BUT it assumes the attacker has no hashing power at this moment. If the attacker is a pool operator and has only a big portion of the hash rate, it will be vastly cheaper. If he has access to at least two big pools, it may already be possible to do such an attack without investing any additional money.

I see it like this: For those 90% we need bitcoin banks. I don't think the goal of Bitcoin is to get rid of all banks (some hope to achieve this, but I don't think it's realistic). But even if 90% of the people store their bitcoins in a bank, the other 10% has the possibility to be their own bank.

Meh. If the price is in BTC, you will only attract people who are already into bitcoin.
With a price in fiat, you attract others too.
If you are no bitcoin enthousiast, a price of X bitcoins won't say much.
A price of X dollars will.

You can't refute someone's argument by pointing to bad things of the spokesman of that argument, regardless what politicians believe. 
The argument is something on its own, without the author. 
So please, can someone explain to me what's wrong with the argument that at the moment, for a regular citizen, it doesn't make sense to use bitcoin.
And when there's no reason to use it today, why should there be any tomorrow? When nobody is using it, we won't suddenly be paid in bitcoin or products be sold for bitcoin (I'm talking for the regular person, there will always be exceptions), solving the problem of converting fiat-&gt;BTC-&gt;fiat.
I'm invested in bitcoin, so I really hope someone can prove me wrong. But ranting on the author does not make me forget his argument.

And that's right. You used your bitcoins to buy gold, this is 1 "usage" of bitcoin more than if you sold it directly for cash.

I think one great advantage of remittance using Bitcoin, is that a remittance service doesn't need to have a 'division' on both ends. Rebit is on the Filipino end, converting BTC into the local currency. Another company in the US or europe, can accept USD or EUR, convert it to BTC and send it to Rebit. If Rebit decides to open a shop in the US, they can send money to their Filipino division, but can also send it to another remittance company, in the Philippines, or any other country, using Bitcoin.

In fact, traders help stabilize the price, by buying when the price is low and selling when price is high.
Suppose there is no trading. At the end/beginning of the month a lot of people get their pay check and buy bitcoins. BAM price sky rockets. A few days before christmas everybody is shopping (so selling). BAM, price plummets. 
Luckily traders will sell when the demand is big, and buy when the demand is low. A currency needs traders to stabilize the price. 
But ok, now the price is very volatile because speculation is a very big part of the price. But it's a mistake to think we don't need traders.
Once the price is (more or less) stable for a long period, and price drops a bit, traders will suspect it to rise again, so will buy. And if price rises they will sell, thinking it will drop again. So we need a "seed" of stability to have stability. But I don't think that's for the near future. I expect the bitcoin price to be very unboring for at least a few more years ;-)

Aaaaaand... It's gone!
No seriously, explore the options of storing the bitcoins yourself. I know it's not a life-changing amount but you can learn a lot by setting up your own bitcoin wallet or paper wallet, instead of just leaving it on an exchange.
Maybe try to spend some too, just to learn how it works. Maybe find a charity you support which accepts bitcoins (or even better: convince a charity to accept it) and send them a small tip.
You can also give away some small amount to some friends, family, or give it as a tip in a restaurant/bar.  is usefull in this situation as you get your bitcoins back if they don't redeem them.

Can someone, instead of just ranting about the author, explain why he is wrong?
In the ideal world you are paid in BTC and buy things in BTC. But that's not how it is now, and I think not many people really believe this will ever be the case for most people.
I think Bitcoin can be the main currency in a niche market, but which market? He is right the cost to exchange fiat to BTC and back makes it a very expensive option.
Please, someone, explain why he is wrong.

Welcome. Don't mind about mining. You won't make a profit, even with your awesome gaming/video-editing pc.
Maybe give the blockchain.info wallet a try. Remember to activate 2 factor authentication (2FA)!
Then, buy some BTC (there are several options depending on your location). Send some to changetip and start tipping on reddit.
Check coinmap.org if there are places in your neighborhood where you can spend some of your bitcoins. If not, there are a lot of web shops where you can spend them.
You can also just hold them and hope the price rises. But spending doesn't mean you can't hold: just buy as many coins as you spend, so you BTC balance stays the same, in case we reach the moon ;)

Yep, same story. Sold bitcoin on localbitcoins. A few months later bank called my account was frozen because the buyer claimed fraudulent payment. After I provided all relevant documents (and the bank asked me to return the money, which I refused), they unfroze my account. Another few months later I had to go to the police to explain what happened. And now I received a notification from the German police (country of the buyer, not my country) an investigation is running against me, for fraud and faking a signature (for signing that payment). 
Needless to say, I'm never selling on localbitcoins again.

I think this is the best explanation yet. First, the miner payout (and so the inflation) is high, with the hope that the increasing adoption, and thus increasing demand, will at least compensate the inflation. As the technology matures, adoption increases more slowly, but the inflation gets smaller too. In the end, we hope enough people will use bitcoin so they can pay little transaction fees and still cover the cost to secure the network (paying the miners). Is this about right? 
Then I think the future of bitcoin depends largely on the correctness of the timing of adjusting the inflation into a deflation (in other words, the adjustments of miner payouts), according to the adoption rate. 
If the payout is too big, the inflation is too big to create an usable system (price keeps dropping -&gt; adoption will slow down -&gt; price drops even more -&gt; ...). If it's too small, the network security is at risk (if the reward is small, no big investments will be done (anymore) in the mining industry, leaving the network vulnerable for attacks).
I really hope Satoshi (or whoever decided this) got it about right...

Indeed. So if you change one character,  the checksum won't be correct any more, so it is not a valid address. 
In other words:  the last characters of the address is the result of a calculation on the other characters. As soon as one character is changed,  the  address is invalid. This is a safety,  so the software can warn you if you made a typo.

I was not really talking about short term. I know there are several advantages (I even had a few situations myself I thought 'Damn it would be a lot easier if I could use bitcoin now'), but I'm not sure if it's enough for average Joe to adapt a complete new currency. A few advantages (although certainly not all) can be implemented by banks and/or payment providers, which would further reduce the reasons to use bitcoin. If for example some payment providers and banks work together to build a tipping system for the internet. They can do it centralized which will be cheaper than the decentralized system Bitcoin uses (you don't have to duplicate and calculate everything thousands of times).
I'm a believer and I'm (long term) invested. But I'm not afraid to think about flaws. I hope by discussing what can be improved, we can improve Bitcoin long term. I'm a bit tired of the mentality here in that you either are 100% sure bitcoin will go "TO THE MOON", or you are a paid troll.

Indeed, that's called investing. Buying something because you expect it to be worth more later. You are saying yourself the bitcoin price necessary for current usage is about $10/BTC. So if you think the usage of bitcoin in a few years will be 50 times the usage of today, every price below $500/BTC could be a good investment.
Obviously, you don't think the usage will be 50 times the usage of today. Well, then you should not invest in bitcoin. But you have to understand for people thinking the usage WILL increase greatly, $240/BTC makes a lot of sense.

The line between gambling and investing is not so clear. If I buy some land, with the plan to sell it for more in a few years, would you call it investing or gambling? I would call it investing, even if the only reason to think the price will rise is because it has increased in recent years. I agree investing in bitcoin is more risky than buying land, but some people have very good reasons to think the price will rise, so for them it's investing, not gambling.
The future price of bitcoin is depending on a lot of factors, but it's certainly not only a factor of dumb luck, like a dice roll.

You talk like the goal of bitcoin is to make profit. You can trade bitcoin, and in trading some will win, some will lose. If you lose money while trading, this money go's to the winning traders. I hope you understand this is not unique to bitcoin... 
If you want to convince me bitcoin is a piramid scheme, you'll have to convince me that gold is a piramid scheme first. Just like with bitcoin, the majority of the value is due to speculation. And just like bitcoin, there is a constantly increasing supply (bitcoin/gold mining).
But if bitcoin succeeds, the majority of the people will not trade bitcoin. They will buy bitcoin to do something with it, they prefer to do with bitcoin (or can only do with bitcoin). That could be storing value, or buying some goods or services with it. I don't see how you can call this a piramid scheme.

Yes, currently the major part of the price is speculation. And indeed, if everybody stopped thinking the price will rise over time, the price could drop to 10$/BTC (or even lower). No new information here.

If you are storing for a long(er) time, a paper wallet is very easy to do.
I think these steps are excluding most (I know, not all) of the dangers, while fairly simple:
- Make sure your pc is clean. Run an up to date antivirus and Malwarebytes. This is something you should always do BTW, also when you store your bitcoins in a web wallet.
- Generate a paper wallet here: 
- Print it 3 times. Keep 2 of them yourself, store the third one somewhere else (at your parents house or whatever. Somewhere it won't get lost and will be kept safe)
- Send your bitcoins to the address on the paper wallet
- If you later want to use your bitcoins, trasfer all of them at once to another wallet (for example blockchain or Coinbase)
Optional steps for extra safety: 
- When generating the paper wallet, check "BIP38 Encrypt" and enter a passphrase (password) YOU WILL REMEMBER. When you do this, you don't have to be afraid someone will find the paper wallet and take all your bitcoins, as long as they don't know the password. BUT, if you forget the password, you lost your coins
- Scan one of the private keys on the paper wallet (with for example the blockchain app) before you send any coins to the addresses, to make sure you printed it correctly and you entered the right password, if you enabled BIP38. Don't use the address of the key you tested (there are 2 more).
- Put a linux live cd in your pc, go to  disconnect the pc from the internet, generate the paper wallets. Other steps are the same.
I know if you are paranoid, you still can find some holes, but I think these are some simple steps which only take a few minutes and are safer than storing everything in a web wallet.

When I take a marble block of value $1000, and carve some amazing statue out of it. The statue is now worth $100,000. Where did the $99,000 come from? It comes from the fact I created something people want. When Bitcoins are created, things are created that people want. So this increases the total "value" of the system without someone having to pay for it.

It's hard to get to know both sides within one subreddit. If you have the time and interest: spend some time here and on Both subreddits are to some degree an echo chambre for their view. Both think the majority agrees with them and only a small minority thinks otherwise.
On both subreddits try to find the more intelligent posts/comments and ignore all the personal insults ("they are idiots", "he is trying to kill bitcoin", ...)
- If Unlimited forks there will be 2 chains. (the chain has been forked). All coins you had before the fork, you have on both chains. Either one chain wins and the other one "dies off" (lack of mining power, economical interest, ... =&gt; doesn't stay relevant) or both chains stay relevant. Then there will be 2 Bitcoin-chains, one for each of the opposing views.
- What will happen with the price? No one really knows. Depends on what "the market" thinks about the fork. If the two chains stay relevant it makes sense that the total invested value is shared over the two chains, so price on both chains would be lower than the current price (but you can sell your existing coins on both chains). But Bitcoin price isn't always logical...
- What do you need to know? Same as always: Don't keep your bitcoins on an exchange, make sure you have access to your private keys and don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
- Extra: Will there be a BU fork and when? We don't know. Miners can "vote" for Bitcoin Unlimited. Currently about 20% of the mining power is pro BU. BU can try to fork at any time, but the bigger percentage of the mining power chooses BU, the bigger the chance their fork "wins". It's not really clear (to me) at which percentage BU will try to fork. Note that (not) voting for BU is not binding. Miners voting for BU can choose to keep mining on the Core chain or vice versa. Some (most?) miners would probably just mine where it's most profitable: so the chain with the best price/difficulty ratio.

Ok, then what should my grandma do to store them easily and safe? I'm really curious. 
Paper wallets? Too hard.
Wallet software? Yeah sure, on her pc with a gazillion viruses.
Trezor? $100 to store her bitcoins? Sure... And what if she loses her trezor? "Sorry grandma, if you lost your trezor you lost all your bitcoins".
For me saying you have to store your own bitcoins is like saying everybody should run his own mail server, because you can't trust other people with your mails. Sure, it may be true, but if you are not tech savy it's just not feasible.

If I sweep a private key I indeed need to trust the wallet I'm sweeping it with. 
Just like you have to trust Ledger/Trezor and the pc you're using it on (software can't get to private key, but it can change the destination address).
Of course, like I already mentioned, once an address is swept, this address is marked as unsafe and is never used again. So once it's swept I have no problem with anyone having the private key.

That's just wrong. If the difficulty drops, I'll get more BTC. If price drops to $50, miners will drop out, and difficulty will drop too. Miners were running with a profit when the price was $50, with the same mining reward.
Even if the price was $1, and all miners except me stop, I'll have $25 every 10 minutes. 
I'm not saying this would be good for bitcoin. But saying "If the price falls to $50, not even the most powerful mining machine in existence right now can avoid a net loss." is just plain wrong.
BTW, if you're so sure bitcoin will fail, do you already have another technology in mind you will bash on once bitcoin is gone? 
@_date: 2014-12-13 12:29:27
You should probably not mine to get bitcoins. Thats's like saying you need to mine if you want gold. It requires very big investments you best leave to specialized companies. Just as with gold, you are better off just buying it.

I know the new coins were not in circulation before,  but by increasing the supply of bitcoins, the value decreases,  unless the demand increases. This is independant of transaction fees. If the demand doesn't increase,  our bitcoins decrease in value at 10% per year,  until the next halving.

The fiat comes from the people buying Bitcoin. But that doesn't mean they lost value. When the supply increases, but the demand doesn't increase, the price will drop. Simple supply &amp; demand. It has happened and it will happen again. Look at the bitcoin price charts. Every time the ticker drops, the demand is lower than the supply. Every time the ticker rises, the demand is higher than the supply.
Is it possible at one point the demand will never keep up anymore with the supply (so the price drops to virtually zero)? Of course. No sane person will tell you otherwise. 
I'm still not getting what you're trying to tell me.

The way Bitcoin works, it will always be less efficient than a centralised system. In Bitcoin thousands of computers need to check every transaction again, instead of one server. If VISA wants to, they will always be able to beat Bitcoin in efficiency (and thus transaction cost). 
The reason the transactions are cheap now, is because every 10 minutes 25 BTC is generated, generating a huge inflation.
The good properties of Bitcoin come from its decentralisation. It's lack of efficiency is the downside of that.
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:34:01
If the profit margin becomes bigger, all the miners who are now shutting down their miners, will power them up again. And then the difficulty increases again, so the profit margins drops.
The way the system is designed will always cause the miners to run on a very small profit margin. So this means until miners can buy their electricity with bitcoin, this will stay this way. And even then, because then the electricity company will have to sell the bitcoins.
For a stable price, as much money has to come in, as the miners reward is worth. This reward will decrease over time though.

I use it for long term storage, so no spending.
When I do need to spend it: sweep one address to a wallet like electrum. If I don't need it all, move remaining (after spending)  to an unused address on my paper wallet. Mark original address as unsafe. 
It's not as fast as with a hardware wallet, but for me that's not an issue as I plan to leave the wallet untouched for at least several years.
I have another wallet to hold some change.

Some very important Bitcoin businesses and miners support Bitcoin Classic and pledged to switch when the binaries are released.
If you think discussing this is not related to Bitcoin, you are delusional. If Classic succeeds in becoming the longest chain, Classic becomes Bitcoin. 
Imagine this scenario: Classic has 75% of mining power and mines the longest chain. Classic becomes Bitcoin. Will everything related to Core be censored from Don't think so...
I'm not saying Classic is the way to go. But ignoring the major players backing it up is just plain dangerous.

Google a bit. You'll find good explanations. One important argument is that they don't believe in Core anymore. Core promised block size increase hard forks long ago to these miners, but didn't deliver, or at least not in the way the miners had expected. Some of them think blocking SegWit is a clear signal they don't agree with the scaling path of Core. They want more and sooner. Which BU promises (but that solution has its own problems).

As this seems to be very hard to understand for some people, I'll write it out in words.
"!=" means "is not equal to". I thought that was common knowledge.
So: SegWit is not the same as SegWit AND a block size increase for regular transactions to 2MB.

I see where the idea "it will be harder to raise the limit" comes from then: If we don't change the ratio's and we want to double how much stripped data can fit in, the weight limit would need to increase to 8 million (8MB), right?
@_date: 2017-08-07 12:48:20
Who knows
@_date: 2017-01-25 11:04:29
Because they want it combined with a blocksize increase.

@_date: 2017-01-25 10:45:25
I know about 2MB of unstripped transactions can fit in a 1 MB block with segwit.
However, this does not mean SegWit == SegWit + 2MB blocks.
SegWit about doubles the space for transactions.
2MB doubles the space for transactions.
SegWit + 2MB blocks quadruples the available space for transactions.
So SegWit != SegWit + 2MB blocks
SegWit is equivalent with 2MB blocks, but what these miners want is SegWit + 2MB blocks. I thought that was widely known by now.

That's why I would like to see Bitcoin Core agreeing with SegWit2x, although I'm certainly not counting on it. Changing the block size limit to 2MB now instead of in a few months/years won't kill Bitcoin. Losing 90% of the miners, which secure the network, might.
BTW I'm a software developer too.

I don't understand where you keep ketting 8MB.
2MB blocks x double the blocksize because of SegWit, is 4MB, not 8.

Better propose this in the subreddit dedicated to Bitcoin price: @_date: 2017-01-25 11:12:40


I have no political agenda. I'm a regular user. I want SegWit. And if that isn't possible without an (additional) blocksize increase (because some miners), then I welcome SegWit + block size increase.
@_date: 2017-01-25 11:19:41


That's their problem. They are afraid that there will never be a blocksize increase once SegWit is active, or it will take years. They know the majority wants SegWit so they are blocking it, so they have leverage to demand a blocksize increase by HF (besides SW) in the near future.
I'm not trying to defend the miners. I'm just trying to explain what they seem to want. As they seem to block activiation of SegWit, which I think we need, it's very important we understand what they want. And if it's no danger for Bitcoin give them what they want so we can move on. With SegWit and 2MB blocks.

You mean Bitcoin Cash.
Since when can't an altcoin choose it's own name anymore? If they call it Bitcoin Cash, it's called Bitcoin Cash.  
Stop using BCash. You make yourself look like an idiot. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 10:12:06
A big part of the miners want to have a real blocksize increase and are blocking SegWit until it's combined with such blocksize increase.
If we now do a fork to SegWit + 2MB block size limit we can move on and have time to develop a more permanent solution. I don't want to know what will happen if we stay in the current situation.

You are making sense until this sentense: 


You're convinced a fork to increase the limit would be easy once it's urgent. But then you see the 8 GB limit in 2036 as something which is uncorrectable. If you think we can increase the limit easily if really necessary, you should also think it's as easy to decrease the limit if we see computer/network resources are not growing as fast as we thought it would. 
I'm just not that convinced the limit will be increased (fast enough) if it becomes really necessary. 
Personally I would prefer a limit increasing more slowly as XT, but currently XT is the only option to make progress in the discussion. This discussion is going on for years now and we're obviously stuck. 
People have different views on what Bitcoin should be able to do and at what cost. I guess we will see in the next months which side will be able to proceed with Bitcoin and which side will have to use or create another cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2015-08-20 09:31:27
If bitcoin transactions will cost $20, (semi-)illegal transactions will be the only usage. If the transaction cost rises to &gt; $10 I'm sure more than 95% of the current users will leave. And with that all investments and innovation.
I will be happily using a cryptocurrency (either Bitcoin with higher blocksize limit or another cryptocurrency) which has advantages for non-illegal use too.

I agree such a system could be a solution. But does such a solution exist already? I'm not talking theoretically. Where can I use it?
If we're lucky and the usage of bitcoin grows dramatically in the near future, and we hit the limit, what are we going to tell the users? "Wait a few years, we just might have a solution by then"? 
@_date: 2015-08-20 12:41:43
I'm afraid if the only usecase for Bitcoin is to wire money internationally for $20 (in countries where international money transfer isn't free, lik in Europe, or for (semi-)illegal transactions), &gt; 95% of the users will leave. And with them the investments and inovation.
Bitcoin needs the smaller transactions, because it needs the users.

@_date: 2017-09-18 05:51:27
There's no such thing as a "next open address" in Bitcoin.
A private key is randomly generated and you don't know the resulting address until you calculate it. So finding a simular address is trial and error. And very hard to do for more than a few chars.
There's also no checking if the address is "free". How would offline address generation do that? Just because there are so many possible addresses, the chance two people generate the same one is practically zero.

I don't get why a lot of people think Bitcoin will either worth nothing, or worth millions.

Don't store the seed on your computer!
The moment you enter those 25 words in a computer, you're exposed.
If you lose/break your trezor, buy a new trezor or other hardware wallet and use the 25 word seed to recover.
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:35:12
I don't own a Trezor (only a Ledger Nano), but entering the 24 words (even in random order) on a website seems to be very dangerous to me. It seems you're right though. If you have to enter the words on a computer, I would strongly advice to do as many security measures as you can (make sure it is offline, clean, if possible running an old linux live cd, ...)
Recovering a Ledger Nano S is done by entering the 24 words in the device itself.
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:57:51
The private keys never leave the hardware wallet. So you can safely use it on a PC, even if it's infected. Just double check the address and amount you're sending on screen of the hardware wallet.

I think Bitcoin exchanges are using some kind of 'initial margin'. You can make as much losses with your position as you can pay back with the total value of your account (or the amount you configured can be used for this). So your position is not immediatly liquidated as soon as you are losing money, but as soon as you don't have sufficient funds in your account to pay the losses.

Just read a bit more about the recovery procedure of the trezor. 
Because the trezor (not the website) is telling you which word you have to enter + some words that aren't in your seed it seems to be pretty safe (there are 6.2E^23 ways to shuffle 24 words).
But just to be sure I would make sure to do it on a safe pc.

You forget that 1 BTC won't be of the same value on both chains.
If the BIP148 chain hasn't economic majority, you can expect it to be of lower value than the original chain. 
So even if the difficulty is lower, if the 12.5BTC on that chain is only a fraction of the value of the 12.5BTC on the original chain, no miners will switch.
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:51:17

If I understand it correctly, the exchange making the margin call trutst you will send them the money, or the market will not move very fast so they have time to wait for your money and liquidate when you don't send them the money?
If this is indeed the case, this seems pretty much impossible to do with Bitcoin exchanges. Most exchange will have no or incorrect personal info on the traders, so good luck with asking money. And even if hey wait just a day for the money, they could be losing a very big amount in this timeframe.
But aside from the fact if it's possible with Bitcoin exchanges or not, we should use the correct terms indeed :)

You're understanding it wrong. By signing a document with the private key linked to an address, he proves he has the private key of that address, without the need to publish this private key. 
However, to be absolute proof he has the private key, he should sign a text we (or someone we trust) choose(s). Otherwise, there's the possibility the real Satoshi sent this signature to him in the past, and Craig is just reusing it now.

A lot of people bought before the halving, expecting the price to rise. I'm thinking a lot of buying pressure will dissappear after the halving (at least in the short term).

@_date: 2016-07-07 09:22:28
You seem to suggest the price will rise after the halving. For the price to rise, a lot of people have to buy (market orders). So, that's why I ask my question: who wil buy after the halving? It seems to me most bought already (causing the rally), so I'm expecting a drop short after the halving.
Ofcourse, I could be wrong, I'm mostly am. But I'm curious to your reasoning. 
@_date: 2016-07-07 08:12:12
People are preparing for the drop
@_date: 2016-07-06 07:27:35
This will probably be downvoted into oblivion but I don't understand why so many seem to be sure the price will rise even more after the halving. There are several reasons why I think this will not be the case:
- Even if all mined bitcoins are directly sold, halving that amount is only a small fraction of the total trading volume.
- I believe a lot of miners don't sell all the bitcoins they receive, but only enough to pay the bills. So this reduces the impact of the halving on the price.
- A lot of people like OP bought BEFORE the halving. So this means the bull rally caused by the halving ALREADY HAPPENED. And indeed, the price almost doubled since february.
- Because the price already doubled, sell pressure stays the same even if the number of coins sold by miners is cut in halve. 3600 BTC sold by miners at $350/BTC is equivalent with 1800BTC sold by miners at $700. And that's in the assumption all miners sell all mined BTC.
- People like OP bought before the halving and will need to sell after the halving. Pushing the price down.
- Some (a lot?) people willing to sell some BTC, are waiting until the halving, in the hope of a price rise. So selling pressure is building up now and will be released after the halving.
- When all those people hoping for a bull run after the halving will see the price drop, they may panic sell.
- When the halving is done, there's no event in the near future anymore that promises a price rise. 
- All those that bought as much as they can afford before the halving, they can only do two things after the halving: hold or sell. Neither of those options pushes the price up...
Yes, there was a bull run after the previous halving. But that was 4 years ago. A lot has changed since then.
I'm not telling you I'm sure the price will drop. I'm just warning to be cautious.
