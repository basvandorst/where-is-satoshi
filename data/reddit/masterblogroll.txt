Why ever not? Where do you get these weird notions? There is nothing to stretch here. Stealing or misappropriating donations will land you in jail.
Further, using donations for purposes other than those indicated at the time of donation is also a form of fraud.

The ad income is being used for the forum software too, aminok. I thought you understood that.
[Here]( is theymos last accounting update (in USD).
**Donations**     
2011: $3,081            
2012: $13,291          
2013: $42,174          
2011: $1,545
2012: $21,014
2013: $243,233
Quarter million dollars from ads in 2013. Last year must have been much more. A little of the funds have also been used for r/Bitcoin on Reddit.

I am not a lawyer, so your opinion is as good as mine, if not better.

Your clarification contains many inaccuracies. 
The fund includes both donations and the more substantial advertising income. Since the stated objective of the funds is community reinvestment and benefits, every registered member, if not the entire Bitcoin community, has the right to ask questions. The forum was not created to enrich theymos. 
theymos is also already paying taxes on the forum's income. 
If theymos runs away with the money, it becomes a simple matter of theft. So he can't do "whatever the hell he wants." Don't encourage him. He's only 22 - he might believe you.

No I don't. But I think most of it happened behind the scenes. I guess if you searched hard enough, you can probably find something.
theymos did [speak briefly]( about it recently.






The original forum was hosted at sourceforge. Then Satoshi created a new forum at bitcoin.org in 2009. Sirius moved it to Bitcointalk in 2011.

Because the funds are meant for the community, which I already wrote in my original comment. How are you not getting this? Have you even read the donation page? Do you understand the issue at all or are you deliberately being obtuse?
No one donated anything to him, no matter how you phrase it. 
Your concern is not for the community. Otherwise, you will not try to hinder the check and balance process. There is nothing senseless about trying to make theymos accountable. The senseless thing is trying to stifle criticisms the way you have been doing all morning. You are doing a disservice to the community by your sycophantic adoration of theymos.
@_date: 2015-04-07 13:54:35
Why is it any of your concern? Let me also correct you - no one donated anything to *him*.
Try to be less obvious. The way you're running around this page defending theymos, people might think your only concern is him.

This is the point of the entire thread - to ask him to explain himself. Every single person who has been on Bitcointalk has the right to question him, because advertising income is part of the fund, aside from the donated sum.
You have no right at all to filter who can ask theymos questions by asking over and over again, "Have you donated?". Not only can't you verify the answer, but like I said earlier, you have no right to ask that. 
He is the custodian of the funds. He does not own the fund. He is answerable to the community. If he abused his position, people who care more than me could pursue civil or legal actions.
Has Gavin been attacked? Has Luke been attacked? Has Peter Wuille been attacked? No, no and no. So no, key figures in the community are not under attack.
Theymos is not being attacked. He is being questioned and taken to task, because he makes questionable decisions and statements, he hardly explains himself and ignores suggestions from people he doesn't like. 
This is a stubborn 22 yr old boy who just spent $1.5 million of the community's fund trying to build a competing forum software using a little known and unproven group of people. What community is he trying to serve here? Did he bother to consult anyone before making this decision? Is he qualified to make the decision?
@_date: 2015-04-07 15:04:55
Fair concern to whom? We are not in a court of law. You and aminok are not his attorneys. I am perplexed why you, aminok and a few others here are trying to create eligibility requirements. How would you even verify my response, assuming I am willing to divulge such information publicly?
@_date: 2015-04-07 15:15:52
He is answerable to his donors and everyone who is a member of Bitcointalk. He has stated that the advertising income is far larger than donated sums. The ad income will continue to grow in the coming years. Unless he is held accountable for his actions by the community, he will continued to ride roughshod over us. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 15:07:14
I rather not. I prefer everything goes smoothly and theymos grows into a leader than we can have faith in. We have enough controversy in Bitcoin.

Theymos is a steward of the Bitcoin community. He is not a hereditary ruler. The donations and much larger advertising income from Bitcointalk is not meant to line his pocket. They were meant for the community's benefit - there are strings attached. Why on earth would Satoshi hand over Bitcointalk to theymos otherwise? Why did sirius relinquished his administratorship to theymos? To allow the forum to be the personal piggybank of an 18yr old boy (theymos age at the time)?
In the last few years, he and his proxies have been trying to push the idea that the money is legally his and he is not answerable to the community. That's horseshit, ethically and legally.
This questionable 6,000 BTC forum deal is theymos attempt to bulldoze his way through the community. Plain and simple.
**Edit**: Just realized some are unaware of how large ad income constitutes Bitcointalk's funds. Copy of my post from way below.
