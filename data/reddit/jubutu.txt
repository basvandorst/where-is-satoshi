How could I trust another email protocol if one of the biggest goes belly up and takes with it all my emails?
Finding that next protocol to trust would be an arduous task. I realize its only hypothetical, but a mass exodus from gmail would cause innumerable problems for other email services. Using something basic like your ISP email account sounds most reliable at a time like that.

When I looked up my region, a lot of the places look like they are banks, they have descriptions like TD, CIBC, BMO etc. Is this the case, you would only purchase bitcoins thru a legitimate financial institution? It's never going to be like "bobs bank of bitcoins" right?

So lets say it says 348.14 CAD in the Price/BTC column, are you getting 1 BTC for $348? When you are spending BTC for purchases do single BTC get split into decimal places? (if so how many?)

Very interesting, my search now comes up with individuals. How is it you carry out the transaction with an individual? How do you receive the bitcoins from them if they are intangible?

Don't hate on me for asking this I simply want to be informed. I read the bitcoin website and I've been following bitcoin story's and articles for a few months, so I understand what it is. But how is it advantageous to buy everyday things in person with Bitcoins as compared to cash or credit as people would typically do? I thought bitcoin was the "currency of the internet" why are we paying for subs with it?

That's the kind of answer you cant Google! Thank you very much for your informative post.

So if you don't have a bank account, we might assume you don't have a credit card, how did you buy bitcoins in the first place? If I lose my bank card I can walk into any branch and get a temporary one. If you lose your Bitcoin wallet what happens, realistically how fast can it be replaced? ( and at whos cost is it replaced ) Also assuming your employer pays you with a cheque, you need to cash it, and if you don't have a bank account we can assume you need to cash your cheque somewhere, and unless they can cash it straight to bitcoin you would need to have it made out to cash which would make your first point moot. Thank you very much for your reply, both of the points make sense but my brain just loooooooves to argue new things. I'm not trying to be a jerk, this is just one of those times I need to ask questions so I can fully understand this.
