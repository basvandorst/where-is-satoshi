Yup, the source is the budget itself, which is linked in the article and contains the text cited in the story (just search for 'bitcoin' in the PDF).

I wrote that story. Here's the feedback from their public affairs director, which should set the record straight. Am editing story to reflect.
"As for the thread - the trick is that the actual cost fluctuates depending on the price of BTC so it could have been 0.6 at some point. :) 
Here is how our membership pricing works:
Individual memberships can only be paid in Bitcoin.  The price is pegged on a daily basis to the Bitcoin Price Index, so the actual cost fluctuates.  (I can tell you from looking at our membership database that today's prices are around 0.9 and 0.09 BTC for lifetime and annual, respectively.)  Prospective members can create an account on our website to see our current membership fees.
I mis-typed when I said 0.9 for annual vs 0.09. That extra zero makes a huge diff, doesn't it? ;) This actually makes us that much more inclusive!
Industry memberships can be paid in either USD or BTC.  The BTC prices are pegged the same way and can also be viewed by creating an account.  USD prices are listed below.
Platinum: $100,000
Gold: $25,000
Silver, large: $5,000
Silver, medium: $2,500
Silver, small: $1,000"
A minute after that, Jinyoung mailed to confirm that yes, it had changed again and was now 0.06BTC. Derp5423 was right, thanks for highlighting that. Hope that clarifies it for everyone.
