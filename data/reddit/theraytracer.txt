Don't get me wrong, I think is a step in a positive direction, but the site can accept purchases via bitpay. This in turn will deposit funds in traditional dollars to Louis C.K.'s site. Louis is not seeing Bitcoins, but actual dollars. There's a subtle and important difference.

I will be watching this with interest when BCG shows up on the tickers. However, they did fall very short of their goal capital of $20M with just under $6M. Has anyone else noticed that their logo is strangely similar to Macquarie Bank?

Please report this to ASIC,  they need more complaints. I know that they already have many, but the more they have the better. Also this is their ABN:  Please note they they are not registered for GST, and that they are a sole trader (aka, a some guy in his mums basement).

Both Coinbase and Poloniex want crypto-currencies to succeed, and as such take KYC and AML extremely seriously. Some of the top reasons for suspended accounts include:
* Paying randsomware
* Sending/receiving coin to/from localbitcoins
* Sending/receiving coin to/from alphabay (and other darkweb places)
* Sending/receiving coin to/from mixers
* This includes first and second degree *exposure* to darkwebs and mixers
* Using the exchanges to deposit and withdraw fiat without actually trading crypto-currencies (the intended purpose)
