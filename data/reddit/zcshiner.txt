It's already in the works.

Thanks for the answer!  I sent mine out on Monday, so I wasn't sure if it was reasonable to expect it today.  It does have to travel across a few states to get to GA.
**Edit**: My funds appeared on Saturday (or perhaps late Friday night, I didn't check after 6pm).  So that's also 6 days for me.

I think visually the indicators would look better on the left side of the service, instead of at the right end.  It's too jagged and non-continuous.  Here is a mock-up [
Otherwise, superb service!

Also watch out for blockchian.info

It's at the bottom.  They haven't checked the exchanges lately because it's apparently on sale...

A suggestion.  You should consider changing your donation address to use the new 'bitcoin:' URI Scheme.

MTR isn't free anymore, and the free version is of the PPC architecture.  MacOS 10.7 stopped supporting Rosetta, the PPC to intel translator, so if your using Lion or newer it won't work.
Handbrake is a fantastic transcoder, but it's my understanding that it doesn't decrypt dvd's anymore.
There used to be a program called Fairmount that would act as a middleman and provide on the fly encryption for DVDs.  It would take the disk decrypt it, and mount it as a drive.  Then you could use handbrake to rip it.
Fairmount has since closed and turned into Mac DVDRipper Pro.

This site only does Mt.Gox and Bitfloor, but it is great nonetheless.

How about some [Bitcoin Accounting/Tracking Software](

I think Bandcamp's name your own price model works rather well.  But, if that doesn't float your boat they say that if you have 7 tracks or more, 0.08BTC/7USD is the sweet spot.

A thermal receipt printer would make quick work of that request.
