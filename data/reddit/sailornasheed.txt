A took me a while to even figure out the religious reference, and I've been studying theology and comparative religion for years.  When I think Noah's Ark, I think of an allegory about preparedness, trust in Deity, and holding faith, through the ridicule of others.  I don't think about some dumbass boat.

I think they just flat out want to crash the market, so selling at "market price" wouldn't even be a concern.  Bitcoin is a dangerous competitor for them.

I was told that it comes from Japanese, so the correct pronunciation should be "dough-gay-coin"

The immediate assumption is that the *whole* world won't be going to shit, and that any shit-going will be relatively easy to spot from at least a couple of weeks out.  
You sell some of the gold for a plane ticket, cart the rest with you to whereverthefuck, and use it to purchase a long stay visa.  You then tut-tut at your fellow countrymen, in between shifts at the ethnic bodega/restaurant that you set up with the rest of your gold.  
It's actually not that bad of a plan, all things considered.  The world is a big place, and the end of the world has a terrible track record of actually happening.  
[This]( really isn't the worst bug out bag in the universe.

It's driving down the price even more.  The price of Bitcoin used to be tied to drugs and illegal guns, so it was pretty stable.  Now, it's tied to fear and enthusiasm, so a tiny setback can easily snowball into a huge crash.
