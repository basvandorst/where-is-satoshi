Back on this sub! I was almost giving up on this thing until I saw the massive coverage lately. Name dropping from Pres, SEC saying it's like gold, etc. Bitcoin gonna hit the big time a lot sooner than I thought. I'm a buyer again and it feels good. You mofos even get what is happening here? This is a big deal.

Yep! It HAD to go through the "government test" if its gonna get where we always though it can be. Inevitable!
@_date: 2019-07-24 17:21:22
All of your points there are related to currency use.  Mnuchin said they have no problem with us using bitcoin as a speculative investment same as gold so why can't we put our sights on that positive nugget of info?

Posts like yours are what happens when you have too much time on your hands and a flair for the dramatic. Or sunstroke I can't tell which in your case buddy. It must take a lot of time to make up your own version of things like this!
@_date: 2019-07-24 17:25:22
No need to be sarcastic. We're on the same side here. I didn't mean literally that I don't think most on here are aware. I'm just stoked that bitcoin has come from where it was when we started to where it is today!
@_date: 2019-11-19 13:54:36
No disrespect but it seems emotion has clouded your logic.
@_date: 2019-11-14 17:13:00
I think you meant to reply to the OP, because it would certainly take far more than a Reddit post to make me feel “salty”. But in any case I couldn’t agree more. Bitcoin does not care what anyone thinks and it never has. And stacking sats is a given if you do any risk investing at all.
@_date: 2019-11-15 15:01:29
The road to high returns is rarely a comfortable ride. If it was, everyone would take that path and there would be no more returns. The only way to make big gains is to experience multiple periods of a high risk of losing. 
There’s a very good reason why they say don’t invest in Bitcoin if you don’t have the stomach for volatility. If you come on a sub such as this and complain and whine about price drops, you are literally complaining about the very environment and makes high returns possible, and Bitcoin may not be for you.
@_date: 2019-11-21 21:38:28
You do realize there are 12 months in a year right? Bitcoin went up for the first 6 and yes, it is indeed the best performing asset 2019. The best performing stocks simply do not compete.

That’s a pretty generalized assumption on your part don’t you think? It’s highly unlikely that anyone discussing Bitcoin fundamentals, mining, potential use cases, etc. Would be banned. The posts insulting Bitcoin investors, using unnecessary language, or claiming that it’s useless and dead were not making this a great community and they’re the ones being banned. Do you honestly believe that people adding value to the sub and helping other users with navigating the space were banned? Because as you said, it’s a “community”, not a place for haters to come and mock that community.
@_date: 2019-11-14 23:08:19
I’m fairly certain it’s the other way around.
@_date: 2019-11-21 16:56:47
That’s not a worry at all sir. Bitcoin has never been more promising or secure and every day that it exists it becomes more trusted and promises more potential to the digital generation soon to take over operations. 
I mean no disrespect but you don’t have enough information to make the comment you just did. Quantum computing in terms of a general use computer is about 30-50 years away. If there’s a quantum computer that one might use to break cryptography, there will be one that can be used to firm up cryptography. That’s how it works.
@_date: 2019-11-24 01:23:54
Not sure how the sarcasm relates to the OP here. First article actually refers to 2021, and the second article, well that’s horse shit. The price dips like this all the time and has for years. So if the present price dip is due to people not needing Bitcoin, then was that also the cause of all those others times? If so why then did the price bounce back after each drop? No, people don’t feel they need bitcoin any less today than they did all those other times the price dropped in the past and that article’s content is more speculated than the price itself.
@_date: 2019-11-22 15:24:06
How cute, you must have just shown up this past few years sir. You see, if you can’t distinguish between Bitcoin and Enron, there’s really not much point in you being in this sub. Bitcoin has a rapidly growing infrastructure and development team, and is a fast growing disruptive technology with a price that’s gone from pennies to thousands in only a decade. And guess what??! These price swings like we are seeing now are precisely how the price moved from pennies to thousands - big drops but even bigger gains, and we’re just getting out of the gate.
@_date: 2019-11-24 01:33:53
Yes a halving should impact price within the following year. There are several theories as to why this is, the most common being that miners hoard their BTC to inflate the price and sell for more because they are now receiving half the reward for the same investment.
As for the price going down, that’s largely due to this being a speculated market and the price of a BYC will likely remain in discovery mode for years to come. One thing we know so far is that every 3 to 4 years or so the price increases significantly. Let’s see if that holds true as we push into the next few years.
@_date: 2019-11-22 14:52:23
I love this space. It brings more excitement in one day than the traditional markets bring in a year. Now I wouldn’t want to be in a position where I was forced to sell at these low prices but you only lose if you sell so this is just cheap bitcoin and entertainment.
@_date: 2019-11-14 23:09:42
So when another speculative store of value like gold drops in price that means it sucks more than when it goes up? Interesting take on investing you have. I call bullshit.
@_date: 2019-11-19 20:05:22
Ahh, good ol logic and common sense backed by numbers. This is not something we see often enough in the sub. So far this year’s low was around 3500 was it not? Which means another higher low even when factoring in the horrible start to the year.
@_date: 2019-11-20 15:14:08
Absolutely terrible advice sir. Invest hard earned money in overinflated stocks on the misunderstanding that blockchain separated from Bitcoin has more potential?? Pay attention folks! Posts like the above are why today there is a strong disconnect between old school financial people and those who see the potential in innovation and disruptive technologies. Pure ignorance, reinforced by overconfidence. Do you think we’d even be talking about blockchain if there was no Bitcoin? I can tell you that Bitcoin remains the best use of blockchain by far sir.
@_date: 2019-11-24 01:28:49
No they did not sir. I have invested in both. You make money by buying low and selling high, or by DCA. Bitcoin provided exceptionally more opportunity to profit through both those methods and not just by a small amount. I’d say by about at least twice as much than stocks.
@_date: 2019-11-25 01:26:06
If you can’t play for at least 3 years then Bitcoin is not for you sir. Well that is of course unless you luck out and enter just before a run up. If you can DCA for 3 years or more however, the reward is easily worth the patience. There are plenty of other investments that can keep you busy while you just buy in to BTC regularly and let time do its fine work.

@_date: 2019-11-25 01:28:50
That’s like condemning a child for not growing faster. Good luck to you sir. You might want to try something that does not require years of patience.
@_date: 2019-11-14 17:04:40
Well sir, Bitcoin is a disruptive technology, a network and a protocol, so comparing it to the internet is common sense and requires very little great thinking or knowledge. It requires only a heartbeat. To compare it to the other things you mentioned however, requires an immense lack of knowledge, because they are nothing alike. I respectfully strongly disagree with your post.
@_date: 2019-11-18 03:30:43

I am not a mean matured person, so I am sorry for whatever happened to make you so upset with the bitcoin supporters on this board. I know many who are involved in multiple stocks long with bitcoin. Some are long term investors.

@_date: 2019-08-14 04:46:18
?? Wait. So you only ever bought bitcoin long ago and did not buy the 3k to 10k range at ALL? And you are on here acting smart because you guessed one of the thousand price moves bitcoin made? What?? So you probably only hold a few thousand dollars, bought it high, and DIDN’T buy when it was low? I’m sorry but that was very dumb. You have no right to be posting about prices or predictions.
@_date: 2019-08-01 19:45:51
What?!? I'll have 2 of whatever this guy had!
@_date: 2019-08-18 14:16:45
News and anticipation of events do not prop up the price of bitcoin sir. I understand how one may think that but bitcoin price is a reflection of supply and demand. The halving means that for the same investment of hardware and other mining costs, miners will make only half the bitcoin. This results is a much higher value in each new coin that is mined. Most predictions are wrong, but to say the price will increase during the year or so after a halving is perfectly logical.
@_date: 2019-08-01 19:52:48
Right place, right time :)
@_date: 2019-08-01 19:46:18
I'm with ya!
@_date: 2019-08-18 15:20:46
Of course not. I can see that you are playing off the semantics of my comment. And well done sir. But assuming demand for bitcoin continues to increase as it has for the past decade (there is every reason to believe it will based on the rate of developments and growth in bitcoin and surrounding industry), then the slower growing existing supply will become more valuable.
@_date: 2019-08-13 19:45:02
These are the small steps that make a big impact. I’ve been seeing these kind of signs all over the place this past year or so more than ever before. I agree with you sir that anyone who has lived through previous technologies going mainstream would have to be blind not to recognize what’s happening before our eyes. Just you watch though I bet there will be people even at 100k saying bitcoin is dead while the rest of us have gone 10x in profit!
@_date: 2019-08-13 20:20:02

@_date: 2019-08-24 15:00:14
I believe it’s viable yes. Hal Finney’s deep involvement with bitcoin and his character plus how satoshi’s departure from bitcoin line up with the time frame when Finney’s illness took a turn for the worse all make him a strong candidate for the real Satoshi!

This is a bitcoin sub. You’re wasting your time posting about the poor performance of b rated alts that none of us in here are invested in. The penny stocks of crypto are their own speculative game sir. They have never been real world projects to begin with.
@_date: 2019-08-29 16:48:17
No, you clearly are talking more nonsense. EVERY trade that nets a gain needs to be logged and capital gains owed on the profit. You’re referring to the amount of capital gains taxes owed with regards to long term cap gains tax versus short term. You should not be so quick to comment without comprehension of the OP.
@_date: 2019-08-21 13:44:21

Why would you care about whether or not you were right about a bitcoin price? Half the people predicting prices were saying the same so it’s not an accomplishment. If you’re not buying these lows you so accurately pegged then you actually make yourself look really stupid.
@_date: 2019-10-16 20:46:19
No disrespect sir, but I find it quite difficult to believe that you have been interested in bitcoin for years but still don’t understand that a halving can not be baked into pricing like a common stock share.

This price dip means very little to us who hold long term. Zoom out and the dip looks quite acceptable as we accumulate and prepare for continued growth over the years to come. When I look at my stock picks and then feel great about a 20% gain since January I look at my bitcoin in disbelief — as it has more than DOUBLED since January, even when factoring in this latest dip. Bitcoin remains the best investment return out there and if anyone can find a better return please pass it along.
@_date: 2019-10-04 16:24:40
It is not until quite a while after a halving that the impact becomes evident. This is common sense - if you start earning half as much money, effective on a particular Monday for example, it wouldn’t be until a few months later once your bills are piling up and your grocery cart is only half as full that you start to see an increased demand for that lost income. The effect doesn’t happen instantly on the day of the halving.
@_date: 2019-08-17 15:27:15
Nobody can say. It’s been stable for weeks in the past, sometimes after which it shot up like after the 3k range, and other time when it shot down like after the 6k range last year. I agree with /diydude2 though, that as things are now, any sub 10k prices would be bought up since there seems to be a lot more interest and new buyers entering the space.
@_date: 2019-08-17 15:29:23
OTC, Exchanges, and clients entering the futures with their own bitcoin as Cryptogrip explained below would make sense. And wherever they can get the best prices!

Yes, exactly. Demand for tether is huge and thus a lower bitcoin price is not always a sign of negativity in bitcoin. It’s simply mass selling to buy back at a lower price.

That’s fine there is no reason to be defensive. I was simply addressing the point about saturation. Back when I first purchased bitcoin I only bought a few hundred dollars worth and would not dare give it the priority of my other investments. As a I learned more I started to invest more seriously in bitcoin. I think it’s fair to say there are many others who may have purchased bitcoin on a small scale in these early times but have far more room to invest more as it continues to catch on. Is that not a fair statement?
@_date: 2019-08-15 15:33:03
Interesting. I guess Buffett’s point was that we simply use it as a place holder for value and the trouble we go through to do so justifies that value. Great for pre-internet times but kind of dumb now when you think about it. In which case sir, makes Bitcoin a hands down better solution!
@_date: 2019-08-14 11:12:28
But what do you know about bitcoin? Storage, mining, segwit, LN, etc? You know there’s a bitcoin markets sub for the nonsense you post about don’t you? They won’t put up with your poor misunderstanding of western economics but at least you’ll be posting in the correct sub and that’s a start sir! You may also learn a thing or two there about your interests!
@_date: 2019-10-25 16:18:25
This is the same organization that owns the New York Stock Exchange sir. They don’t mess around. 
If anyone out there was going to get institutional investment to move out of their comfort zone of cash settled futures and dip their feet in Bitcoin settled futures it’s the NYSE folks. This is just the starting point of what we can expect will be monumentally larger with the years ahead.
@_date: 2019-08-14 04:53:17
Shift into tether and back to bitcoin without having to withdraw or convert to fiat. Bitcoin moves fast and that’s how many big players catch the opportunities to make gains and build their stack. Tether is a mechanism for trading but the end game is accumulating bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-13 03:52:23
You have been misled sir. Perhaps you are trolling which would explain why you would post something most of us know is false but I’m giving you the benefit of the doubt. We wish 8% of the world had been saturated with bitcoin ownership but the false source you found should not overshadow your common sense. Also understand that saturation includes not only those that have purchased bitcoin but how much they purchased. Let’s just say we’re nowhere near saturation. We’re barely even out of the gate!
@_date: 2019-10-24 18:50:51

@_date: 2019-08-29 15:21:35

@_date: 2019-08-21 12:09:11
Fixed supply is actually great for a value store/asset as a speculative investment. Mass adoption doesn’t need to be for currency, at least not any time soon. Where have you been the past few years? 2015 called and they want their troll back.

@_date: 2019-08-19 00:34:59
Events, not the anticipation of them. Bitcoin has rarely behaved like a stock where something like a halving is priced in. A halving impacts price after it occurs not before. I was addressing your original comment.
@_date: 2019-08-15 14:48:49
Oh I see how you’re viewing all this. As a value store yes gold is mainstream. It better be since it’s been around for 1000s of years right? Bitcoin was created as a currency. Then the narrative changed and it was an investment + currency. Then it shifted to an investment/asset that could be used as currency, and now value store is the narrative. This kind of entity has never existed in human history and because of its capabilities to be all of the above and much more it would be equivalent to insanity to think saturation of the fixed supply is anywhere close to achieved. Saturation should not be even discussed yet because we have not even cracked the lid on this technology. I believe you should widen your lens on how you perceive bitcoin but I also respect your choice to try and analyze bitcoin with pre-bitcoin era thinking. I just would not recommend it.
@_date: 2019-10-26 19:24:26
How does one become as uninformed as you appear to be? Call it manipulation or whales or institutional participation, but there are forces much bigger than you at work here. And this fact alone should tell you that instead of being over for bitcoin it’s quite the opposite sir. It’s only just begun.
@_date: 2019-10-16 19:55:49
Anyone complaining and not buying is missing a great opportunity here. Can it go lower? Sure. But the selling is not hard enough and the drops are not deep enough to take it much lower. Unless this changes soon, I expect sideways at worst and a big comeback at best.
@_date: 2019-10-04 10:16:23
I wouldn’t worry yet sir. 8k shows solid support. It’s more likely that we move sideways then continue upwards. But nobody can possibly know the future or they’d be very wealthy.

So much focus on day to day and week to week price makes it easy to take our eyes off the ball. The investment in third party bitcoin infrastructure and mining has never been higher and this can only be expected to increase over time. The price will follow folks, it’s inevitable short of the internet itself collapsing. One thing has not changed in ten years: Patience will be rewarded in this space.
@_date: 2019-08-15 15:27:33
Professionals have debated this for years sir. Do you really have such a high self value that you believe you have the answers they were not able to find? You present only one side of the argument. The entire system will need to be restructured for a deflationary, digitally streamed bitcoin economy to succeed. So your arguments of the current structure are not relevant. Granted this is generations away, but need to be considered in this conversation. For the short term I agree that value store will prevail as bitcoin is superior in efficiency to gold in our modern world.
@_date: 2019-08-15 14:24:45
Of course there are new investors, just not at the volume many of us would like to see. Give it time. Just a few years ago only hard core techie types bought bitcoin. These things take a few decades to go mainstream. Look at the up side sir, it gives us opportunity to get in now before it becomes easy for average people to purchase and trust!

Surely you can’t be serious? The FED has a whole floor for a department dedicated to crypto you say? That in itself is absurd, and even if it weren’t do you understand that bitcoin is a global entity and is impacted by more than just the US? Just the Asian markets alone wield a heavy impact.

Incorrect sir. Bitcoin started 2019 at 3400 and ended at twice that value. At one point it even hit 1300. No rational thinking sane person can call that a bad year. 2018 was a bear yes but if you did any research you’d know that those years after a big spike have been a regular part of Bitcoin’s growth.

You can’t possibly price in the ripple effect of a reduced supply. People think they can sure but they are thinking stocks and a totally different set of mechanics. Bitcoin is supply and demand, not a corporate productivity and revenue generating score.

Why would he say something that dumb? If it starts 2020 at a given price and moves sideways for 6 months how is that down or up? It started 2019 around 3400 so he is correct, it is up a lot this year.

Yes it is thriving sir. That is not debatable. I’ve been in this space a long time and Bitcoin has come a very long way in a short decade. The Bitcoin of today looks nothing like the Bitcoin of 10 years ago, and nothing like how it will look in another 10 years when additional technology is built on top of it.
@_date: 2019-12-17 16:32:28
What are you talking about? I see a protocol that has recently been confirmed as solid and stable since it has a decade of running without issue. I see developments and new use cases popping up on top of Bitcoin’s protocol that will be coming into fruition over the next few years so I am simply saying that 2017 was not the peak in response to the OP.

Never heard that before ever in the past 6 years... only about 200 times but then I suppose there has been turmoil many times and will be much more. That’s a part of being in this space, but Turmoil has never stopped Bitcoin before and I highly doubt there will be any turmoil that could be worse than what Bitcoin has already overcome in the past.
@_date: 2019-12-09 22:26:42
Of course not sir. Bitcoin’s solution eliminates the need for trust and eliminates the need for a third party middleman such as a bank or an accountant  to verify. Nothing is immune to social attacks because we are human. Email, bank information, identity and more will always be susceptible to social attacks so long as a human decision can be influenced. Bitcoin is not vulnerable to social attacks, but the human in control of the keys may be.
@_date: 2019-12-29 16:40:33
Hmm, interesting reply. Almost as though you were, oh I don’t know, fragile? Turns out it was only obvious to you for a reason ha ha.
@_date: 2019-12-16 22:26:49
Peak crypto? Debatable. Peak Bitcoin? ABSOLUTELY NOT. Bitcoin is just getting off the ground sir. The best is yet to come.
@_date: 2019-12-17 22:15:09
Son, if you don’t have money every week then you may need to consider that you probably should not be offering your opinion on investing to a sub full of Bitcoin investors.
And what are you smoking, to say to at Bitcoin had a bad year? Forget about how high it’s been and think about the opportunity. It started this year at $3400. If you are not capable of seeing that opportunity than you have no right to call Bitcoin a bad investment. You sound very ignorant and young.
@_date: 2019-12-18 22:03:44
No it’s a fiscal year, it’s how you measure performance of an investment. Do you invest or just make baseless comments? I NEVER cherry pick ANY points. I DCA like any smart investor. I buy ALL points and it’s a fact that if you bought regularly, once per week, month, whatever this entire year your average buy would be around 5k and you would be profitable right now. Never cherry pick, buy all prices sir.

I was going to simply say that it will be way past our lifetimes obviously, since it’s only now beginning to actually be taken seriously. But since it was such a weak troll attempt I thought I’d check your post history. You have dedicated all your posts to lame attempts to downplay Bitcoin. Why such devotion to a technology you seem to have little good to say about? I mean either you go and learn about bitcoin on a knowledge level that surpasses the basic market price and grasp the concept of why the surrounding space around Bitcoin has grown globally, or you will continue to sound like a troll for nothing more than .... well the sake of being a troll. And trust me when I say - we’ve dealt with far more informed and crafty trolls than you sir.
@_date: 2019-12-13 17:34:41
Since May? Funny I’ve messed with those stocks for years and am very familiar. I have not seen those kinds of gains since May. BUT Since April I’ve made over 100% on Bitcoin. You need to get better at investing sir. Get with the program!
@_date: 2019-09-24 13:43:14
Yes sir. It’s how media and content marketing works. You identify a trend and align content with the trend to maximize traffic for advertising revenue earned from views and clicks. Currently bitcoin has people watching the price waiting and worried it might drop a little more. Trolls and media will capitalize on this attention. Nothing to worry about folks! Bitcoin goes up and bitcoin goes down but if you zoom out it’s all up!!!
@_date: 2019-09-11 17:40:45
Holding? He he, I’m not just holding value I’m buying more. I’m not an amature who calls 5k to try and scare the tiny few people who would believe such an absurd thing. You’d be wise to do the same.
@_date: 2019-09-23 12:44:43
You clearly are under the impression that if you repeatedly say the same thing for weeks like you’ve been doing it will eventually be true. Only problem is you’re still wrong after all this time. So the question is, do you wear egg well or will you just disappear from the sub like the other trolls rather than admit you’re wrong?
@_date: 2019-09-04 21:28:09
What is “this”? Aren’t you the same person who made a comment yesterday without context as well? It’s like there’s a portion of your comment missing when you post. Please clarify.
@_date: 2019-09-24 02:48:42
We should be good to go my friends. Many were expecting a “sell the news” event after the bakkt launch and thought we’d see a big dump. All we got was a little dip that we can recover from for a joke and there’s really no other catalyst to sell coming up. It should be sideways and up from here. Accumulation engaged.
@_date: 2019-09-22 15:02:21
I think anyone serious about this stuff will agree with you sir. It’s kind of common sense. The OP is likely undereducated, and possibly trolling. He just isn’t very good at it.
@_date: 2019-09-04 00:46:08
? The rest of your comment is missing sir. Did you catch wind of some interesting bitcoin news you’d like to share?
@_date: 2019-09-06 10:29:49
This is where Bitcoin shines sir. Sure some people treat crypto like a casino but its hedge against inflation is one of the many things that define Bitcoin. This is only going to become more and more of an obvious upside to bitcoin as more time goes by. Congratulations on being a forward thinking and taking ownership of your financial situation.
@_date: 2019-09-24 17:52:39
This is poor logic sir But perhaps you are using satire. There has been more organic growth in 2019 than any other year in bitcoin’s history. The hype pumps of the past did not see the sustainability of this year’s growth from 3k to 9k+. If you refer to this price growth as manipulation than you may have lost your mind back when we initially grew from a few hundred US dollars to 1000!
@_date: 2019-09-11 14:45:42
I see. You’re a troll. I don’t follow the sub closely enough to identify the trolls, but ty for clarifying. Good luck with ummm, well, whatever it is you hope to accomplish.
@_date: 2019-09-23 15:05:11
Interesting, you’re not just trolling. You’re actually delusional. I don’t see that a lot in the bear community.
@_date: 2019-09-25 11:16:03
You have a very odd attitude sir. Of course there is such thing as investing, I do it all the time as do many others. If you invested in bitcoin as little as 5 years ago your return would be exceptional. Bitcoin is on an upward trajectory as an evolving technology but your focus on the week to week prices has distorted your perception. I buy in small amounts as I do with all my investments and then don’t give it a second thought. Sometimes it goes up and others it goes down. In a few years it will most very likely be up far above today’s price so I don’t sweat the small stuff.
@_date: 2019-09-11 17:51:29
There may be plenty of bear traps to reset soon sir.
@_date: 2019-09-25 11:41:32
If you buy here and there and hold on to it, you’ll have more value in a few years. But if you’re looking for a return on your money soon then it’s just a gamble.
@_date: 2019-09-04 21:29:27
I’d consider this a positive for sure.
@_date: 2019-09-25 11:19:14
Well, it’s hard not to believe in something that has been going up for years. You just need to focus on the long term not this day to day and week to week nonsense.
@_date: 2019-09-11 14:33:26
So you know something the rest of us do not? I know serious people very heavily invested in bitcoin (much more than the 1 bitcoin average of people in this sub) and the general consensus is consistent accumulation between now and next year. I’d love to know where you speculate that the sell pressure will come from when so much accumulation has come from far above 5k. There needs to be profit potential or a devastating blow to fundamentals and neither are there to bring us that low. If you’re shorting on that kind of extreme I believe you are wasting your time and possibly your money sir.
