Is the address space large enough to handle a galactic economy? Like trillions of transactions per hour? Genuine question.

Is it possible to get 51%?
@_date: 2012-09-26 23:45:44
This. Field of dreamsy, but it's the only way to scale up.

If you have the wallet crypto details you can brute force password attempts against it.

Thanks for your comment, I can see the reasoning behind what you say but I'm not sure how I can add value beyond extending the feature set, but that wouldn't be something I would want to do only for my bitcoin customers. At the same time, I do want to encourage the bitcoin crowd and give them an incentive to pay with bitcoin if it is an option for them. Do you have any good suggestions?

Hmm.. That would be an interesting offer, is that a common approach? I haven't seen anything like that, I'm not sure I'd be willing to do it without something to compare against.

Yes, I didn't reverse engineer the hashing algs or anything. I basically stripped the Bitcoin app down to a command line program that takes an input and attempts it against the wallet. This way you can pipe a list of passwords into it, for instance, or the output of a password generation program.

I haven't. I'm not claiming there aren't improvements to be made, in fact I'm hoping for someone who knows a little more than me to see what I've done and help it along. I have a number of password schemes that might have been used, I just haven't gotten around to writing the generators for them. One speed up I'm pursuing at the moment is to remove (if possible) the source code's dependency on secure strings, which appears to prevent me from using something like GNU's parallel. (I really would like to use parallel...)

And decentralized control is something to give up?
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:44:18
That's true. That is actually already the intent for all buyers, although it should probably be spelled out on the order page. Thanks for following up!

Dave helped me unlock my wallet containing 16 BTC, you can trust him. If anything, he takes on the risk since there is no guarantee once he gives you the password that you'll pay him, and you don't have to give him the actual wallet for him to be able to hack away at the password.

It's an incredible leap to say bitcoin will supplant the US dollar

They could embrace it and profit off the legitimacy such a move would engender, but that won't happen.
