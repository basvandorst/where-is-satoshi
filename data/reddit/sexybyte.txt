But haven't miners and large parts of the community asked for a blocksize hard fork since more than 2 years?
@_date: 2017-09-30 08:50:57
Yes, put a flag in your front yard and buy the supporter merchandise.
@_date: 2017-09-30 10:07:21
R/bitcoin cutting out a tongue? Can someone explain?
@_date: 2017-10-05 23:16:25
See the other thread:
@_date: 2017-10-01 12:11:54
Do you have any evidence to support this or are you just spreading lies?
@_date: 2017-09-30 14:00:46
I am mostly wondering whether you really believe that a doubling of blocksize leads to all these doomsday scenarios.

Did btu coins ever exist?
@_date: 2017-10-04 22:50:40
There is no exponential problem. The number of required transactions per human would rather grow linear. Not taking microtransactions into account.
@_date: 2017-10-02 10:16:29


It is up to the minority chain to implement replay protection. They refused to.
But more serious: Bitcoin is all about personal control. You cannot force anyone what to implement or what not. All you can do is to chose the software you run (or develop).
@_date: 2017-09-30 12:38:44
So none of them owns bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-30 08:16:47




It goes both ways. A chain without hashpower is slow and not safe.


Many people are using Facebook messenger instead of end to end encrypted alternatives.


Investors follow the market.

Average Joe is not running a full node anyway.
But even with 200 GB per year he could easily afford it. 2 TB Harddisks cost 50 USD and most parts of the world have unlimited Internet data for reasonably low costs.
@_date: 2017-10-01 14:13:37
You mean it is better to use a coin that is not supported by businesses? To trade only with your friends?
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:32:05


No, we are talking about the increase in block size. See OP's post.
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:37:09
I can fill up the mempool with low fee transactions that have zero chance to get mined. 
How is this related to a required blocksize increase? Nonsense.
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:13:05
I support segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:31:45
For quite a while r/bitcoin would sort comments in some threads by "controversial".
@_date: 2017-10-05 21:32:40
Could be pure coincidence and totally not related to rapidly increasing fees and blocks being full right at the same time.
However, Occam's razor tells me that it is related. But to answer your question: no, I don't have a study.
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:09:25
That is the miner support.
Economic support (users buying and selling coins) can potentially influence the miner support. But this might just happen after the fork when the two chains can be traded.
@_date: 2017-10-07 14:37:51
The doubling of the average blocksize (actually to ~4MB) will buy us enough time to establish 2nd layer scaling solutions. 
Otherwise bitcoin might lose most of its market share to altcoins as soon as fees increase again.
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:15:12


Any source or theoretical analysis of this? Or just FUD?

Yeah, let's get rid of miners. Bitcoin to the moon! UASF!!1! /s

Not possible without hardfork.
@_date: 2017-10-03 07:20:43
Bitcoin is  certainly less private than cash.
Nearly all exchanges follow KYC rules. And most users are not able to move bitcoin in a private way.
@_date: 2017-10-05 23:31:44
Yes, how dare anyone would criticise core developers. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 08:54:31
A scaling of the blocksize via hardfork has been requested by large parts of the community since more than 2 years.
Discrediting it as "backroom deal" is not really related to segwit2x having significant support in the community. Especially looking outside of this forum. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 13:58:18


You mean the proof for your baseless claim is your baseless claim?
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:14:21


Would be great if you could specify. What are these seeds, how and what does it take over?
Bitcoin and btc1 is open source, you can run whatever client you want.

Light wallets will follow the chain with the most proof of work. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 21:16:40
Then you can just change to vertcoin.
But it does not solve centralization anyway. Big companies can still specialize in mining the new coin. In the end it is just about access to cheap energy.

Your post started off well... but then everything turns wrong and wonky.
@_date: 2017-10-01 07:04:23


Be careful with giving this kind of investment advice. Always get information from multiple sources and not only one forum.
@_date: 2017-10-05 11:15:47
How about giving people freedom of choice what chain they want to use? There is nothing to be combated.
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:20:41
Because of blocks being full 
and bitcoin lost half of its market dominance because of full blocks.
 (3rd graph)
This has been very predictable and core refused to take care of this problem in time. And I don't think a ~4MB blocksize with s2x will lead to a significant amount of increase in centralization.
It has been painful to see how many businesses stopped accepting bitcoin because of high fees in the last year.
@_date: 2017-10-05 08:07:53
Segwit2x will never have 8 MB blocks. This is a theoretical limit that will never be reached with actual transactions. 
The average blocksize of segwit2x blocks will be 4 MB max.
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:49:50
Same as now. You mostly need access to cheap electricity.
@_date: 2017-10-05 11:23:03
Why should bitcoin be controlled by programmers? That's not how bitcoin's consensus works. You can change to ripple if you like this.
@_date: 2017-10-05 11:30:18
Haven't you just learned in a different thread that you are using wrong numbers for blocksizes?
Segwit2x will be less than 4MB
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:00:13
Next step will be to implement some kind of consensus mechanism that enables voting in an untrusted network of computers.
@_date: 2017-10-04 19:28:29
You misspelled defamation campaigns run by certain sides of the scaling debate.
@_date: 2017-10-01 10:05:04


May the best denunciation campaign win.
On a more serious note: I sincerely hope that bitcoin and its monetary incentives are not susceptible to all these FUD campaigns.
@_date: 2017-10-04 06:33:03
With "invalid", Satoshi means that the client cannot understand the protocol rules eg of a new block format. He is not talking about "invalid" in terms of consensus.
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:28:21


How is your node related to this? Is it mining? Or are you running an exchange with it? Or a big business? 
If not I would rather suggest to put a flag in your front yard or [No2X] on your twitter account.

Thanks for not spreading wrong information about how important nodes are, Peter. Maybe you can explain this to lukejr and greg as well. They have made many people here believe that running your little node at home is important to the network.

You made a baseless claim that coinbase will swap coins. If you have support for this post it please.
Most exchanges did not make statements about how they deal with the November hardfork.
I assume your FUD against coinbase is simply because they don't support your opinion about bitcoin scaling.
@_date: 2017-10-07 06:47:34
The best advise is to get information from multiple sources and not just one.
Bitcoins on coinbase will be fine for beginners. Long-term it is always better to have coins in your own wallet where you have control over the private keys.
@_date: 2017-10-05 23:41:34
Why would you store the bitcoin blockchain on an SSD?
With that argument I could also use a gold-covered PC for my full node. That would also be prohibitively expensive. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 18:57:11


I consider myself way above "Average Joe" and don't feel the need to permanently run a full node.
However, you can be more than sure that I would run one as soon as someone decides to attack the network infrastructure.
That is all bitcoin needs and it is no problem at all even with 10 MB blocks.
@_date: 2017-10-04 08:10:52


The whole thread is about Segwit2x. Starting from the title.
@_date: 2017-10-01 10:02:43


I have no idea what this sentence means.
@_date: 2017-10-04 07:22:04


Bitcoin Core can understand the block format of Segwit2x. It just doesn't agree with the protocol rules. Your post is just nonsense.
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:08:38
I support segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-10-01 09:09:21
You could just proof him wrong that atomic swaps are complicated and demonstrate one in the next hour.
@_date: 2017-10-05 11:11:53
According to LukeJr you should run bitcoin out of the jungle with a raspberry pi. This is why most people don't listen to him.
@_date: 2017-10-04 08:37:13
No, consensus rules change and it depends on the client whether a block is seen as valid or invalid.
The current bitcoin core client has different protocol rules compared to earlier versions of Satoshi's client.
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:27:59


Still better than counting votes based on astroturfing campaigns and node counts (IP-addresses).
@_date: 2017-10-02 13:27:20
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:26:55
yeah... besides the personal attacks for supporting on-chain scaling of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-06 21:57:02


What a nonsense. Learn how open source works. Users are free to decide to run whatever code they want.
@_date: 2017-10-05 11:08:57


Miners want to increase the blocksize which would much more efficiently and directly reduce fees. Miners want more adoption.
@_date: 2017-10-07 10:36:40
Great idea. The design of bitcointalk is terrible and the donated money to relaunch the forum has been embezzled.
@_date: 2017-10-04 08:41:54
Core can clearly parse and understand the block. It just rejects them because of protocol rules of the Core implementation. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 21:06:00
Yeah, but the goal is that the legacy coin is the altcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-05 21:28:44
yeah, happens...

And whoever wants to make sure that moderation is fair can just read the mod-logs.
@_date: 2017-10-02 09:01:46
It is supposed to be destructive. Minority chains are not supposed to survive. They are not secure and susceptible to 51% attacks.
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:45:16


This is not correct. Block propagation takes 10s of milliseconds. Miners use relay-networks like fibre or falcon. The mining centralization because of bigger blocks is just FUD.
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:41:13


No, it would show bad intent if there would only be seed-servers from Core supporters on the network. It is quite obvious that a more diverse collection of seed servers is better for the network.
@_date: 2017-10-05 23:22:04
That's what your crystal ball tells you? Currently it is not even 1.1 MB.

yawn... maybe it is time for some better conspiracy theories.
@_date: 2017-10-01 21:24:43


What do you mean by this? Since Bitcoin's inception Bitcoin has always been the chain with the most hashpower. No altcoin ever had more hashpower than Bitcoin.
After the fork Bitcoin will still be the chain with the most hashpower.
@_date: 2017-10-03 07:38:32
The BCH price might go significantly up in the uncertainty before the fork.
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:20:41
Well, it is not really the VC in miners that influences the economics. It is much more that they will influence the rate at which new blocks are generated. This means the minority chain will be slow and nearly unusable.
In addition, miners can attack a potential minority chain with a 51% attack. Unfortunately miners have been much too peaceful in the past and did not use chances for 51% attacks.
@_date: 2017-10-02 08:36:20


This is a very important design feature of bitcoin to avoid minority chains to survive.
@_date: 2017-10-02 13:23:12
Number of btc1 full nodes will certainly increase towards the hardfork date. Most users use SPV clients anyway and will follow the longest bitcoin chain.
@_date: 2017-10-04 09:10:06


This is not true, eg. the blocksize limit has been reduced in the past, making previously valid blocks invalid.
@_date: 2017-10-04 18:46:28
Only the stuck-up developers who cannot deal with other people disagreeing with them will leave.
@_date: 2017-10-05 21:41:23
If you want I can send you an amazon link to a 2 TB hard disk for less than 50 USD. 
This will allow you to store a blockchain with constantly full segwit2x blocks for the next 10 years.
@_date: 2017-10-04 18:37:26


Yes, strange. I have the feeling other forums and bitcoin meetups are much more pro segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-10-06 21:43:03
Where do I claim that you said that? It is an interpretation of your statements which include eg. reduction of blocksize and constant complaining about bandwidth limits.
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:40:54


Don't forget the chemtrails. They use chemtrails to control your thoughts.
@_date: 2017-09-30 11:38:32


I just looked it up. Bitcoin.com has just 1.3% of the hashpower. How is this a critical share? Roger Ver also does not seem to have any significant role in segwit2x besides being an advocate for it.
@_date: 2017-10-05 23:14:15
I have heard these arguments over and over again. Fact is that my 6 year old laptop is able to sync the blockchain without problems. And the vast majority of internet providers does not have bandwidths limits (as long as you are not living in the US or Australia).
@_date: 2017-10-02 09:08:35
Terms of service are largely irrelevant. If I set up some ToS with a hidden term that you owe me 1 Million USD there is no way to enforce this.

@_date: 2017-10-05 20:32:29
Well.. my comment was meant sarcastic. I rarely agree with you but a more decentralized PoW would be nice.
Unfortunately the only other option that I am aware of is proof-of-stake with its own set of problems.
Or we can start voting by twitter/facebook accounts. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 11:25:06

The rest of your points are just FUD.

@_date: 2017-10-03 07:03:27
Happy to help. Here is the relevant part:
"The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs."
@_date: 2017-10-01 21:45:16
Still the best guess we have. You can use market cap instead if you like.
All the other alternatives like twitter polls or node count are way less reliable.
@_date: 2017-10-01 06:56:27
A technical reason would be that segwit2x increases the expected average blocksize from ~1.8 MB to ~3.6 MB. 
That means the blockchain would grow by 190 GB per year instead of 95 GB per year. 
Some people say that is too much because of bandwidth and storage requirements. Other people disagree with that.
@_date: 2017-10-02 06:48:06
Opinion of users cannot be measures and is way to easy to be manipulated. Do you realise that the main invention of bitcoin is to solve this problem and make consensus measurable?
@_date: 2017-10-04 18:17:46
Life is a blockchain. Proof-of-work is to reproduce successfully and use up resources.
Currently the ants are fighting with humans about the exact definition of proof-of-work and whether it is the number of individuals that counts.

Can you point me to the spam in the graph? We are talking about longterm scaling of bitcoin. Or do you claim the smooth increase in adoption since 2014 is a coordinated spam attack?
@_date: 2017-10-06 10:21:58
See my post above. Spam waves could potentially be responsible for short term peaks (as discussed in the article you linked).
But we are talking about long term trends.

Spam could be responsible for short-term fluctuations but would not influence the big picture. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 18:46:04
Why would it make a difference whether the node is on AWS or at your home? 
Why would the the network care that your node rejects 2x nodes? You cannot take a p2p network down by inserting malicious nodes. 2x would survive even with 95% rejecting nodes.
I assume you just repeat some nonsense that you learned from the UASF-time.
@_date: 2017-10-02 11:51:52
Wallet apps are giving people a choice. You can run whatever app you want.
@_date: 2017-10-02 13:06:33
Core client for the current chain, btc1 for the segwit2x chain.
You will need to install 2 clients, but hopefully the minority chain will die anyway. In this case replay attacks do not matter.
If both chains survive I am pretty sure there will be simple solutions to split your coins (could be offered by exchanges as a service if you send them your coins).
@_date: 2017-10-04 08:16:04


If the majority of the network (economic + users + hashrate) decides to change consensus rules, the block is **not** invalid.
Otherwise the current bitcoin core would produce invalid blocks because they are not compatible with Satoshi's original client.
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:41:09


What a nonsense. With full adoption segwit blocks will be ~1.7 MB max with normal transaction patterns.
@_date: 2017-10-06 10:26:29
yadda yadda
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:28:18
These seeds don't take anything over. They just provide a starting point to look for other peers in the bitcoin network. The seed-list contains many other servers from all sides of the scaling debate.
Worst case you can add your own seeds anyway. Of course btc1 would add some of their own servers, otherwise their client could be rejected by adversary seed servers.
Anyway you probably know that and just want to spread FUD.
