I pretty sure that you invested more money in it to cover your losses and to make it look like you are in the green. Your 1st post had 0 nano in it and I have a very good memory and I remember like it was yesterday that you bought btc at around 7700. Maybe 7500. I'm pretty sure that you are a major attention whore with nothing to contribute to the community. I could be wrong but numbers in my head don't lie. You bought your criptos when prices were higher and suddenly you are 20% in the green gtfo

You still have the option of bitstamp or kraken
