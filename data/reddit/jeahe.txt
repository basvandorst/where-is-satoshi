The internet didn't really have any competition comparable to that of bitcoin, though.

But plenty of others have higher limits and thus better chances of dealing with short-term demand, until a long-term solution can be deployed.

It's worth noting that this is possible because the mempool never really clears anymore, and would be much harder and more expensive if there were more block space available.

relative to the amount you're transfering, yes. i can't tell you an exact number since it depends a on how it was originally sent to you (number of "inputs", which is a factor in the final transaction size). if you have them in some sort of wallet software it should be able to estimate the fees for you

moving it to a segwit address first will require an extra transaction, so it will probably be more expensive. just send it to coinbase or some other exchange to cash it out.

maybe. but if you don't know, please stop presenting your theories as fact. it doesn't help bitcoin resolve its problems.

any proof of your claims? it's hard to tell the difference between a "spam attack" and the network just being clogged from people trying to use its very limited capacity.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:57:29
That might be the case, but increasing the supply of block space will definitely decrease the price of transactions, which is what we are trying to argue for here. We shouldn't be reckless and we should keep pursuing second layer solutions of course.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:56:03
it really isn't. the current futures volume is tiny compared to the normal bitcoin exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:20:18
That might be true - I agree that Ethereum for example have even bigger problems coming up. However it doesn't chance the fact that a reasonable blocksize increase could help Bitcoin immensely until we have something better ready for use.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:54:22
Even if it's all spam, this attack is made possible because of the small blocksize. If anything it should be an argument for an increase.

i dont really mean to put words in your mouth, but i've seen this a lot and there's never any explanation for it. who do you think is doing this? 
wouldn't common sense actually tell you that it's the recent explosion of users who are trying to move their coins?
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:01:39
I somewhat disagree with the idea that every user needs their own node. To me, be your own bank implies that you have full control over your money, which you have even without your own node. 
The thing about all the other fancy solutions is that they require tons of developer investment from the entire ecosystem, which is why we're seeing such slow adoption of segwit. The cool thing about simply increasing the blocksize is that it will instantly improve the situation for everyone, with minimal effort.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:44:49
let me guess. the miners, who are most invested in the bitcoin network, are trying to undermine it?
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:19:17
There is absolutely no difference between doing the increase the segwit way or the bcash way. Except that the simpler hard fork way would have been immediately useful.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:36:49
Sure it might. But so what? It will be cheaper for legitimate users to transact, which is the problem we need to solve. As we've already seen, these types of use are quickly priced out of the blocks. Im not suggesting removing the limit completely.

i would need to sell everything first
