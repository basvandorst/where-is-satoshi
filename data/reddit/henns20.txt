whats interesting  is - 
1. the motion that was filed by the counselor in Switzerland was on 9/11 - 7 days before this post and
2.  the magazine article which it references - is from 9/15. So this has not been picked up in bitcoin news other than here. 
currently bitstamp. is back to trading at 127.45 just 50 cents lower than when that big sell order came in

I new something was up when a 1200 bitcoins came on the ask(sell) on bitstamp out of nowhere and it had a sell price $3.75($124) lower than the current bid at the time. 
This came out now? Weird it is the middle of the night in Switzerland - assuming it submission for publication for tomorrow. 
- edit looks like your post initiated it - bc that forum post on bitcoin talk you referenced looks like it was from 5 hrs before it was put Reddit - reddit seems to have peoples attention for bitcoin - Reuters for bitcoin.

[coinsetter]( is an exchange in beta in the US. They are saying it will be a exchange that you will be able to sell short. Other than that I have not found any place that allows you to do that.

update - this was a multibit issue - the sending of bitcoins got "stuck" and we are troubleshooting it right now. Looks like just need to reset. 
Here is the documentation in case similar thing happens.

1. If you are in the US then Coinbase is a good place to start if you just want to get bitcoin from USD. They are the most - to me - transparent and developed site out there. The interface has a Paypal feel. 
I have been using them since Aug 1 and i have found their bitcoin pricing is tied directly to Bitstamp.net (bitcoin trading platoform based in Europe and I believe bitstamp as an exchange has just surpassed mt gox for volume - so good source for pricing)
2. CampBX is another place you can get bitcoin if in US. 
3. Bitstamp.net if your in Europe seems like the place to be. Very liquid (lot of buyers and sellers).

Surprised police can't help. Does the panera have security cameras?

I checked the blockchain.info for the address i created with coinbase wallet - "No transactions found for this address, it has probably not been used on the network yet." i asked to confirm he was connected to the internet at the time of the sending from his wallet.
