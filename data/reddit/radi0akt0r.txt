Don’t bring too much attention to yourself out there man!

In Canada you can purchase bitcoin with cash from an ATM, no ID required - just a phone number for receipt.  
One downside would be camera surveillance at the location of the ATM.

This is not good advice.
OP sounds smart enough not to follow this anyway

Depending on how long you’re willing to hang on to them, it’s technically never too late based on past and current trends

Yeah, I’d rather not advertise what city I live in

Consider it not wasted then.

Never seen it before.  I’m not a big fan of their crypto platform but it’s still public exposure

I definitely do not want to go to war with Iran.  No blood is worth the success of Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-18 22:43:24
Well you definitely sound like you’re taking precautionary steps at least

Will Bitcoin reach $1 million in 2019? These leading experts will shock you!

There are many places one can use Bitcoin to purchase goods and services, both online and brick and mortar.  You can’t do that with Apple shares.  It’s a little different.

Now we wait for that guy to come in and say they don’t actual accept Bitcoin because it gets converted to fiat ...

It’s great that you’re supporting bitcoin and all but for your own safety, this isn’t the best idea.
A real quick look at your comment history and it’s pretty easy to determine that you’re in possession of some bitcoin.  Lots of criminals out there don’t need more than that to be enticed.
Be safe out there folks

For the average person who has heard of bitcoin but never really considered buying or investing in it, seeing this ad would likely spark interest. 
If just a few people commit to a bit of research  into bitcoin after seeing the ad, that is definitely contributing to adoption

They had less sales volume but say Bob purchased a new computer for $2000 and paid with bitcoin, that would have been 20BTC.  When the value jumped to $19,500, that initial $2000 is now $195,000 for newegg
