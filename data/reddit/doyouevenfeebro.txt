Hey guys, Lurker here - should I hate coinbase? I'm pretty sure the answer is yes, just checking. Ive got, hate - Chinese miners, forks (controversial + none controversial), alternate coins, competing implementations, bigger blcks, 0 confirmations, layer 1, Satoshi, Andresen, Hearn, Craig wright plus a mobile wallet I've forgotten the name of. I'm sure I've missed a few just a heads up on coinbase would be appreciated. 
EDIT : low fees, spam, memory dealer

Hard forks are cleaner. Lets say there is a hard fork to raise the blocksize you guys here don't want it and you'll fight against it? That's nuts :)

Oh man maybe this might have been avoided if only there had been some way the network could have been enlarged to accept more transactions/users, maybe all our excited talk about paying higher fees and just using bitcoin as an occasional layer has backfired on us. Don't shoot me down but could bitcoins database be kept at key locations like coinbase, blockstream, bitpay etc. this might save on overall electricity and reduce fees by not having to pay miners also devs can just roll updates straight out getting rid of these stupid soft/hard forks and general disagreements.

This thinking would mean contentious soft forks are even more dangerous.

The original blcksize was 32mb the temporary 1mb limit was introduced you could do some research and find out why (try google) Satoshi gives the simple instructions how it should be raised here -
