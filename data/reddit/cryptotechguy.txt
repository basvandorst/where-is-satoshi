Can you please explain how can they steal your money?
Now, I am not really happy that Lightning Network nodes will get bigger, I am just saying it will eventually happen. It fits nicely to the model of current banks, and if they see enough profit, they will go for it.

How exactly are banks going to steal your money?

This is exactly why I think you wouldn't have thousands of Lightning Network nodes, but only few dozen. There is no incentive for you to open up a channel if you are going to send microTXs. 
Ideally you would want payment channels to your most frequent merchants, the ones you do business often. If you buy daily, you can create channel with them directly. But that's way far in the future. Right now, you would want to be connected to the node that can route TXs cheaply, and is connected to most of the BTC merchants. This is where I see banks can do much better than Bob and Claire in the mentioned example - they are already connected to the merchants, and now they have incentive (fees) to get into bitcoin space. 
Without profit, what incentives are there for banks, paypals, and other payment providers?

I think they still haven't addressed the question of routing messages in LN. Some devs think LN is far away from working implementation because of this reason. 
I like the idea of LN, but I think eventually big banks will step in and become middlemen, with only 2 hops from Alice to Dave, through them.

You are welcome to try stealing my wallet:

If it's not on blockchain, it's not really in use, is it? Except for some backups to cold wallets and such..

Watched the whole video, mindblown. The way I see it, Andreas haven't even scratched the surface of Bitcoin possibilities because he can't possibly explain to them in that short timeframe. 
Anyways, kudos to Andreas for his amazing contribution to community.

I guess its the same if you found a safe with cash in it. You could try and find the owner and return it because it's obvious mistake to throw out money, and then the owner could give you finders fee if he chooses to do so. Or you don't return cash. It's really up to the moral of a finder. 
But, to go ahead and try stealing other peoples money by using malware, keylogers and stuff, is amoral, and ilegal in some countries. Once bitcoin is used worldwide, it will probably be ilegal to steal private keys too.

I have been listening Andreas since 2012 or so, and I think his speech was much better when he was at the Canadian Senate:  
The knowing that gray heads had to listen to something they will probably never understand is beyond my expectations.

Google is getting in the game as Ligtning Network node..
