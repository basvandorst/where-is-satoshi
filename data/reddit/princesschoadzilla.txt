It's worth pointing out that we, the bitcoin people, do technically get to control the rate of creation. It's just that Bitcoin is leading to a world where economically, we understand that the 21 million cap needs to be adhered to.

What constitutes spam?
It's a gray area, but some rules of thumb:
It's not strictly forbidden to submit a link to a site that you own or otherwise benefit from in some way, but you should sort of consider yourself on thin ice. So please pay careful attention to the rest of these bullet points.
If your contribution to reddit consists mostly of submitting links to a site(s) that you own or otherwise benefit from in some way, and additionally if you do not participate in discussion, or reply to peoples questions, regardless of how many upvotes your submissions get, you are a spammer. **If over 10% of your submissions are your own site/content/affiliate links, you're almost certainly a spammer.**
If people historically downvote your links or ones similar to yours, and you feel the need to keep submitting them anyway, they're probably spam.
If people historically upvote your links or ones like them -- and we're talking about real people here, not sockpuppets or people you asked to go vote for you -- congratulations! It may not be spam! However, you still need to follow the guidelines for self promotion
If nobody's submitted a link like yours before, give it a shot. But don't flood the new queue; submit one or two times and see what happens.
To play it safe, write to the moderators of the community you'd like to submit to. They'll probably appreciate the advance notice. They might also set community-specific rules that supersede the ones above. And that's okay -- that's the whole point of letting people create their own reddit communities and define what's on topic and what's spam.
If you're thinking of doing any self-promotion on reddit, you might want to read this first.

caixin is like chinese bloomberg, it's a reputable source.
the Chinese have already had a day with this as the news broke yesterday morning for them.
the specific english language reports from china are saying that the initial fud report was only partially correct namely with the date 4/15.
coindesk's article on the fud from 3/21/14 translates the pboc's weibo and reveals the PBOC admitting to releasing a notice to regional banks on 3/18/14.  That is the notice that has now been reported on, in more detail. however, clearly not enough detail to quell you trolls

go fuck yourself. we can actually go through histories and see who is more OG if you'd like.
i know you're not a newcomer because I recognize your name from at least 2013.  I really thought someone like you would be more respectful to your peers, let alone your betters.
you're the one making assumptions about others (me) being newcomers.
OP whom i was addressing, not your ass, actually was a newcomer -_-
i made a very valid point about newcomers not knowing about previous mining pools nearing 50% and the resulting community action
once again, go fuck yourself.

Peter clearly either knew about the finCEN stuff coming or was super good at anticipating it.  Regardless if it's a step down a dark road that ends as you describe, it still is a first step that's necessary for bitcoin's legitimacy.  I do agree with you though.
Which is why we will always have multiple exchanges based all around the world so even ~~if~~ when the US makes a large move it will damage bitcoin but by no means destroy it.

and then wonders if China will evolve into what America "used to be"
and THEN states that America is going the chinese way.

If you get allowance, tell them you want to receive it in Bitcoin.  I would like to think that your parents aren't anti-bitcoin, just anti-you-spending-their-money.  If you can't convince them that bitcoin is a good place for your/their money, then you should make your own money.
YES i know you're 14, but when I was 14 I was making my own money.
Then ask your parents to use their over18ness to buy coins for you, with your money..

it is incredibly tough to explain bitcoin to people that have no understanding of computers, p2p networks, cryptography, or especially **economics**.
My solution is always to start from the ground up with a brief econ lesson about money, because everyone [1st world] knows the merits of gold, potential pitfalls of credit cards, ridiculousness of bank fees, etc.
explain that money is a store of value, a medium of exchange, and a unit of account. then explain how bitcoin excels over traditional monies in each and every way, because... computers :P

i don't know why you don't know this but... :)
transactions have transaction fees. that get added to the block reward in the newly mined block. at the point that for all intents and purposes all 21 million btc are outt in the wild, the block reward will be next to 0, and the transaction fee in aggregate will be the reward to the miner.
does that answer your question?

I can help your investor friend out. Lots of ppl here are going to scream scam city xp. But if this is the real deal feel free to pm me with preferred contact method..
And I will only accept btc. Escrow service allowed, buyer pays fee
Obligatory:gpu mining btc will likely never make a return at this point. I can set it up to mine ltc..

I don't have time to do a full translation as I'm studying. but the quality of this article is superior to a lot of the english stuff that comes out/has come out in the past :)
It starts off with a simple analogy to attempt to bridge the gap for the large number of computer illiterate people in China.
Touches only briefly on the recent volatility in the last month.
Mentions Jet Li's One Foundation accepting bitcoin donations and the large amount generated :):) I are a proud contributor
Goes into the history of bitcoin
concepts of nodes, issues of money, etc, etc.
talks about public/private keys
the blockchain
psuedonymous nature of bitcoin, through a tieback to tracking the one's foundations donations through the blockchain
then tying back to mining
THEN, going into a personal story/interview with a living, breathing, talking bitcoin miner in China
mentions of alt currencies, bitcoins for houses, possible identities of satoshi, etc etc.
This is craycray

if you truly believe in the superiority of a mathematically superior "currency" for its quasi-deflationary nature when compared to the basket of real world currencies, which are under the control of central banks that print money [cause inflation] like nobody's business; well then, you will then understand that 21 million [or 50 per block as losermcfail was saying] is an arbitrary number.
As bitcoins are theoretically infinitely divisible, there's no reason why Bitcoin couldn't have one bitcoin not 21 million bitcoins as the hard cap. :P

this is due to the large sell wall that was on gox for awhile last night.  coinbase definitely doesn't use gox, nobody should -.-
coinbase's price is and always has been pegged to be higher than bitstamp's price. so when bitstamp's price was higher than mtgox's, again due to the sell wall on mtgox last night, coinbase's price was higher than mtgox's.
this kind of confusion is natural, but the explanation is so incredibly logical :)

i'm in litecoin now... but just cuz i'm a miner and as long as i can change it for btc it has value to me. namecoin is used to register .bit domains, so they are the only alt chain that has a fundamental difference in USE. Right now a lot of the infrastructure is lacking, there haven't been any devs to namecoin for months now according to the wiki, but essentially in the event of a global censorship war. nmc will be used to create an uncensored internet.
@_date: 2013-09-05 20:36:31

@_date: 2013-03-10 17:24:54
I agree with this a lottt. Unfortunately it's unlikely that namecoins will take off until there is a global censorship war/issue/whateverthefuck.
That being said, the development of .bit domains is taking off. and I really want to get my hands on one

A huge barrier to people becoming miners is... understanding of economics to think about the long term you're suggesting. and also, lack of computer knowledge.

so just-dice automatically assigns you an account the first time you visit their website. you assign a username and pw and 2factor auth if you'd like.
every time you deposit, a new deposit address is made, and old ones can be used again if you want [but that would create a trail].
The mixing part comes with the withdrawing from just-dice.
every withdrawal address is unique from the deposit address, so yes it is more intentional like SR than incidental like mtgox.
also, mtgox's "mixing" isn't anywhere like it used to be as some people report having to verify to move btc out...

the next halving of the block reward is going to be sometime in 2017, then some time in the 2020s after that it'll be ~6ish, I feel that around this time, when the network is sending over 100x more transactions per second than it is now, tx fess will outweight miner block reward. as for when it will outweigh the electricity used to mine? sooner

Going with Pine Gap being a massive data collection center, it's definitely entirely probable that they have a node there, you know as a full copy of the blockchain so they can do the same blockchain analysis that we do.

Everyone complains about the exchange rate volatility but they are missing this point!
Once the bitcoin economy is large enough to make bitcoin prices on rwal goods sticky, then we will have even more growth.
Another thing... menu costs are real for brick and mortar institutions and in part are the counterweight that make usd prices sticky even as its exchange rate fluctuates wildly. Menu costs with bitcoin are as close to zero as they can get. This is the internet!
@_date: 2013-03-18 05:54:26
.... some of these comments show an utter lack of understanding for the way that mined coins effect the usd/btc exchange rate: a function of supply and demand of bitcoins. 
 bitcoin exchanges show the current buys and asks, and people like you and me decide whether or not to buy or sell at those prices.
There are 25 bitcoins "mined" with each block, every 10 minutes.
This translates to roughly 3600 bitcoins released to various miners in the course of 24 hours.
You're saying that 1/3 of these are our daily sell orders... and the fact is that would be a meager 1200 bitcoins, which is *2.4%* of the actual [50,000 btc in sell orders just on gox](
the lower power consumption of the ASIC's will not result in "miners selling fewer coins"
and miners selling fewer coins has no guaranteed positive effect on btc prices in any magnitude
@_date: 2013-08-31 21:11:40

idiot, it is not a donation to other bitcoin-holders because a donation really implies that someone, the beneficiary of the donation, is better off than they were before. In this sense, since everyone [bitcoin holders that is] benefits from their destruction of bitcoins equally, nobody has had anything donated to them.
just as a thought experiment, consider another set of 50 bitcoins that has had its private key destroyed and has been lost. wired magazine's destruction of ~10 more btc in the lifetime of the jalapeño makes the absence of the aforementioned 50 btc, by that "bitcoin holder" more exacerbated. that isn't a donation any which way by anyone's standards
@_date: 2013-06-01 18:03:58
so i guess i'm imagining something where I only remember one username and password combination, that would act as a private key. and whatever this based-on-bitcoin-architecture is, it would create cryptographically secured/unique keys[passwords] to use each time i traditionally would need a new username/pw combo?
Like the way we generate send/receive addresses. :)

Starcraft is wonderful.
Bitcoin would definitely provide unique publicity and generate revenue that way. It sounds like you are thinking about putting sitting money into bitcoin while you wait for things to fall into place.  A lot of people here are going to tell you that the volatility in the exchange rate is too high to put allll the monies in. "Dont invest more than you can lose". Even more ppl will say you couldnt possibly buy the things you would need w bitcoin.
I want to be one to encourage you to try, legally, the ALL bitcoin approach. It will happen some day and the sooner the better. Between billpayforcoins and bitspend you have options. But your biggest resource is the bitcoin community. Anything you need in this world. Someone has and is willing to sell. They just might not be near you.   If only there were some way to facilitate the necessary transactions w no risk of fraud...
Thank satoshi for bitcoin

You're right of course. The more brick and mortar establishments both in and out of the US that accept bitcoin the better. For my use and everyone else's use as well.

sha 256 asics can't do flops from what i've read.. do correct me if i'm wrong.  Previously when the bitcoin network was secured by gpu miners, aka **when the numbers in bitcoinwatch's calculator were set**, comparisons were genuine and in the line of what you're saying. because graphics cards actually have flop ratings cuz they can do any type of calculations/operations.
however bitcoin mining asics can only do one thing
hence, in the sense of flop power, and **any** computations besides sha256, the bitcoin network now isn't comparable to even the folding network.  do you see what i mean?
don't get me wrong, the bitcoin network is the worlds largest distributed supercomputer, but the emphasis is on largest and distributed.
so really all my assertions are true.

In the crash of 2011, the early miners who did at that point have huge stacks of coins spread them out to hundreds of thousands of decentralized users in the crash from 31 to 2.  You can, through blockchain, track which wallets have the largest balances.
see here: 
tldr; nobody has 20% of all bitcoins, they are fairly well dispersed. use blockchain.info
With that said, let's pick apart your hypothetical.. I'm TIRED of seeing bitcoin and ponzi in the same sentence. 
"A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation that pays returns to its investors from their own money or the money paid by subsequent investors, rather than from profit earned by the individual or organization running the operation"
1) The bitcoin exchange rate is a DIRECT function of supply and demand, across multiple exchanges.  Bitcoin floats against every currency in the world, 24/7... If your supposed bitcoin ponzi scheme director were to bring 20% of ~10m coins in circulation to sell on exchanges... guess what, people who value those coins as money will buy them up for USE.
2) Bitcoins have a use, they aren't just an investment opportunity.. For billions of people this is literally the first item that they could conceivably purchase that could be worth more tomorrow than today.  Perks of a mathematically secure cryptocurrency.
if you believe in p2p currency but you don't believe in bitcoin because you doubt the devs.. why would you trust the devs from any other p2p currency?  I really really hope you're talking about litecoin and not ripple or something..
The updater of the bitcoin client is you, if you get compromised with malicious intent; well fuck, you have larger problems than this.

fiat  =/= backed by nothing.
it means, by command of. Most people in the world, us excluded of course ;), are fine with operating under the command and eye of their governmint.
bitcoin isn't fiat money, it isn't quite commodity money either. If you read [this paper]( you will see that bitcoin is arguably a quasi-commodity money.

If we were to have the Bitcoin network do flops, it would be slower than the 500th most powerful supercomputer. your sources and everything are talking about flops.

the stretch to: "They will attack bitcoin." There are organizations that want to damage bitcoin, and that do have economic incentive outside of the bitcoin system, but attacks haven't occurred.  Other altcoins have been attacked though, clearly there are other strong variables, such as ease/legality that play into those simplified statements
We all know that a 51% attack can happen, I'm merely poking at the model.
the simplification down to a two player two move game vastly distorts the reality of the situation. Where the bitcoin economy is made up of more than miners, and miners have vastly different utility functions..

My experience comes from S.Dice securities w/ mpex.co but the concept is the same.  These passthroughs exist because the original IPOs/platforms have prohibitive entrance fees, ie. 30 btc reg fee for mpex.
Passthroughs are created by generous folk who can overcome that hurdle, buy a shitton of the securities/bonds/stocks and then let us normal folk trade with them.  Of course there is a fee, you might only get 95% of the dividend per share but that is preferable to a 30 btc reg fee.
Anyways.. try  and  as well

very honestly, the fake trading data could be "real data" from the times of no fees. operator trades 20k btc then trades it right back.
now that every chinese exchange has fees again, of course the volume would suddenly shrink: this will be their explanation :P
but all in all it was a run up to make China's influence on Bitcoin look huge, and at each level the "winds of exaggeration" swept through.

Litecoin would be "good" for bitcoin. but it's purpose is definitely lost...
In the statement: "the silver to bitcoin's gold" we suppose that bitcoin is like gold and thus needs a silver...
FALSE SO FALSE. The only reason silver had its value as a commodity currency was as a store of value AGAINST spikes in gold inflation from the new world.
Bitcoin doesn't have the weaknesses that any other money that has existed before all do.  It doesn't need silver :P

bitcoins? or litecoins?

@_date: 2013-11-03 21:48:31
you've identified trends that seem to follow difficulty changes.  there are altcoins that people switch their miners to, yes their asic miners, just a handful of sha256 ones that could potentially be more profitable right after a difficulty spike, causing what you see as a hashrate drop after the difficulty goes up.
the other thing is, the total bitcoin hashrate is and always will be an ESTIMATE, and that estimate gets thrown off every time there is a new difficulty adjustment.
third and perhaps more importantly, mining companies, even BFL, explicitly say that they test on the testnet that is meant for such things.  While there have been historic misuse of some avalon products, as a general phenomenon the prolonged testing of asic miners and/or the story of asics being used and not shipped until they are profitable is just utter bullshit spouted by idiots who want an excuse to stay away from mining, and it is gobbled up by the idiots that like bitcoin but can't understand mining or zero sum game theory

I agree with your point in so far as the CSRC [China Securities Regulatory Commission] might start investigating, if they have not already.  However, I don't think they would be very efficacious in tracking down Mr. Chinese Delicatcy, he's remained anon for a reason! The shares are all direct shares, and none of the passthroughs that these shares are traded on are hosted in China.
At the end of the day though.... what's **maybe**likely to happen sometime in the future is an utter cessation of communication and dividends from Mr. Chinese Delicatcy.. due to his entire operation being nationalized. lololol

Make sure it isn't clipped to someone else's belt who just happens to be walking right alongside you until he leaves..

I feel that any place accepting btc can/will have their own terminal as you mentioned. However we can eliminate the risks by using your home computer. Or a library computer. To create a wallet that you would just be using once.
Say you load up 0.1btc. Go to the new pub that accepts btc. You login on the machine and pay your bill. Say 0.07 btc. And in the same session you send the "change" to a wallet owned by you. Or one of those send to email thingies. But it is def possible

Bitcoin is the BEST way for migrant workers in/within/around ALL countries/provinces in the world to send their remittances home.  The ONLY thing that is required is a bitcoin exchange, or a localbitcoins broker within vicinity and we can end the ridiculous fees that people pay when sending money to their families abroad.
The elimination of fees from the use of big name corps like western union or underground routes by means of cartel or triad means that these brave souls that travel thousands of miles away from their family and homeland just to work for LESS than minimum wage will be able to save more money, and maybe even squeeze in a visit home..
or for you conservatives.. it'll get the illegal mexis home earlier.

I meant fees, as in fees on transactions from 50 odd countries that are excluded right now. Also, paypal can't prompt ebay to do anything, it's the otherway around since ebay owns paypal. most of all, funding a paypal account with bitcoin =/= integrating bitcoin payments directly into ebay auctions.
the latter is unlikely to happen for various reasons... think ebay's protection services,

Very honestly, it depends on what happens on every other exchange in the meantime. :) I hope lots of people are taking advantage of cash deposit options at various other exchanges to get USD in in order to buy bitcoins right now. If the price on other exchanges rises above $120, then naturally everyone on mtgox will be playing catchup.
This is especially true given that only trades are out. it's not like coins are locked into mtgox, and that's the only place to sell them now or in the future. If the general consensus by the bitcoin population, including the hft/hedgefund/speculatinbitches types, is that the value of btc is under $120 by jst 11:00am, then the price on other exchanges will DEFINITELY reflect that.
the mtgox paradigm for bitcoin is very much akin to the american paradigm for world affairs, so ignorant of the world out there! Even if all btc in gox was locked in, there's still a vast majority OUT of gox that could enter any of the other exchanges.

hello youngin. let me start off by telling you to **not** demand things. your post title definitely belies your age.
I would suggest that you go get a part-time job. earn some of your own money, and then use it to buy bitcoins, using coinbase.
As many people will tell you, gpu mining *bitcoin* isn't that profitable anymore.  You should trade your gtx 460 for an equivalent amd radeon card so you can up your hashing power for free. and then switch to an alt coin.
be smart. don't ever sell your bitcoins

the short answer is if you could still gpu miner btc profitably, then you'd be able to do it more profitably than other people. but at this point in time it isn't worth it for the specialized hardware.
you CAN, however, gpu mine other coins and trade them for BTC.

I don't think they'll ever reach ROI in complete bitcoin terms.  However, if you bought the 2 btc with ~$250 specifically to buy the erupter, then it's entirely possible that the ~1btc you'll mine in its lifetime will be worth more in USD terms, based on a future exchange rate.
The next question is.. if you really understood and were counting on bitcoin exchange rate to rise like that, why didn't you just hold the 2btc to begin with :P
To which, the only answer is to add security to the bitcoin network....
don't forget to solo mine if you're trying to do that though... being a part of the pool removes your.... autonomy so to say?

why would services accepting bitcoin stop accepting them? In this instance, they would just use the bitcoin payment processing services they are already using to convert the bitcoins into fiat as soon as they receive them. as a transactional medium the exchange rate of bitcoin wouldn't matter. All this would do is end speculating by regular businesses..
@_date: 2013-08-31 18:49:06
you don't **have** to control over 50%, you just have to mine x amount of blocks until the receiver thinks a double spend didn't happen, but you know it did.
i can think of a few times in the last few weeks that asicminer or btcguild has relayed 6 blocks in a row, which could have been a 51% attack but now we get into the really nitty gritty of it.
you need that high percentage for a prolonged period of time to do any real damage lol. not to mention if a malignant miner ever did appear we would hardfork away quite fast

i remember this... i understand that it was indeed a double spend because both parties received enough confirmations to make the chance of a double spend statistically improbable. but under normal circumstances. I guess my question is just, would that double spend test have "failed" if the parties receiving the bitcoins locked their books upon hearing of the fork and only reopoened it after it was all said and done?
sorry if that was wordy ._.

Hi Choadzilla,
Thank you for your email and interest in supporting free knowledge -- it seems like you already know we don't accept bitcoins :) The Wikimedia Foundation, as a donor-driven organization, has a fiduciary duty to be responsible and prudent with its money. The Foundation does not currently accept Bitcoin or other currencies not backed by the full faith and credit of an issuing government. We do, however, strive to provide as many methods of donating as possible and continue to monitor Bitcoin with interest and may revisit this position should circumstances change.
Thank you again for your interest, and please feel free to contact us with any further questions.

Some bitcoin stocks/securities take hits in their asset value when the btc/usd exchange rate rises. But these are due to lowered revenues.
For instance... for Satoshi Dice, as the btc/usd exchange rate essentially doubled in 2013, peoples' average bet sizes went down because they were thinking about it in relative USD terms.  All in all, btc profit for S.DICE went down for this month, and the dividend payment reflected that, and the price of the security itself has reflected that as well.
That being said, ASICMINER's dividends come from their hashing power, and while there is some correlation between the exchange rate and the hashing power [as the exchange rate gets higher, it becomes profitable for more people to mine bitcoins, hence the overall network hashrate will get higher, but this is negligible to ASICMINER as they are int he Thash/s range, and are probably pushing miners out not drawing them in :P
... so ASICMINER's profits aren't as susceptible to changes in the USD/BTC exchange rate

you're missing the point: ebay auctions only allow paypal for payment if you expect their insurance coverage, which includes the ability to chargeback, open cases, etc. Currently, if you sell/buy an item, you're welcome to settle outside of ebay/paypal, including with bitcoin, but sending a tx id from blockchain.info does not cut it as proof of purchase. and that is all there would be if ebay auctions were to have a QR code..
they will allow people to add $/ or whatever currency to their paypal account at current exchange rate with bitcoins, but beyond that they have less incentives, and in the case of ebay auction integration. negative incentives

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't there a coordinated effort to bid these prices up? [organized on bitcointalk]
I know that that has been the case for all the preorder items on sale on ebay recently... Also, non-bitcoin transactions on ebay have such a high percentage of nopayment and whatnot, 
This is all BS until someone actual comes forward saying they bought the item/sold the item, and there wasn't a buyer protection case.
I'm almost tempted to bid it up, win it, pay the money, receive the item, mine on it until the end of my buyer protection, and then file a case.. at the end of which I will receive back ALL my USD, minus whatever shipping there is, and the seller will have his erupter back... without having been able to mine on it during that time.

Facts say online gambling accounted for **almost** half of all bitcoin transactions [on the blockchain] in the month of **June**.
I guarantee you that since the month of June, which was also the debut month of just-dice, the amount of bets on Sdice has most certainly fallen.
If you're going to stretch the definition of "bitcoin transactions" from on the blockchain transactions with paid tx fees to miners to include off the chain transactions such as inputs.io or coinbase or, it'll be tougher to do such overarching analysis
If you're going to stretch the definition of "bitcoin transactions" to include bets made on just-dice and all the other lovely bitcoin gambling sites, well then you're just a shitty journalist looking for a catchy but **untrue** headline

the point is that an arbitrary timeframe is just that: ARBITRARY. if we look at value of bitcoin from before 10000 coin pizza to after 10000 coin pizza, in those 24 hours, or 24 minutes, bitcoin increased by a factor of... INFINITY.
The price was at 50.01 for all of a few seconds/minutes, who knows with the lag, and only on one exchange..

I've been using bitfunder for the last few weeks, mostly to get in on that ziggap IPO!  I was initially turned away by their terms and conditions but at the end of the day this is where trust comes in, and trust is all we have in the wild wild west of bitcoinland.
    We (BitFunder) do not accept responsibility for anything.
    WARNING: Use at your own risk.
    You must agree to 1 and 2.
^Their terms and conditions.
You use  to directly fund btc to be used on bitfunder.com; it's pretty simple and doesn't take much time at all to set up.  Both sites have 2-factor authentication, and I've had zero problems with btc in and out so far.
Anything could turn sour though.. see scryb3's comment below.

On this topic I would like to sayyyyyy:
I have personally used  and  for some months without a single problem.
Another huge plus point for havelock that you may have missed is that they DON'T take a cut of your trades: so arguably it is the most liquid of sdice passthroughs as it has the lowest transaction costs. Also it helps people like us get a taste of day trading :P
 is inaccessible to bitcoin laypeople like me and you... 30btc would go just to the registration fee.
An important thing to consider with bitcoin investments is the issue of the exchange rate and how it effects the actions of users of whatever bitcoin service/firm/etc and also other investors.
For instance, while there is evidence that s.dice betting volumes have been increasing all the same throughout the incredible exchange rate rally, one can't help but think that people are betting less overall btc because they play with their native currency in mind.  Investors definitely have been thinking of their gains in USD, not BTC.  S.dice is trading for roughly half the price that it was in January.
Anyways, this is what you would need: [statistical analysis](
to calculate out what you think a fair price for sdice is :P
Mining firms, such as ASICMINER or HIM, will pay dividends based on their mining revenue, and as such will be greatly effected when/if BFL ships.  Every delay that BFL announces is good news for ASICMINER and vice versa for HIM.  These theoretically would not see the issues caused by a changing exchange rate as everything is in btc.
if coinbase had an IPO you'd want to get in on it right?
any bitcoin service that will grow as adoption of bitcoin grows is a "sure bet"

Fees! Fees! Fees!
No risk of chargeback, attract nerdy tenants that ALWAYS pay rent on time :P
DC has a LARGE population of renters, especially short-term renters.  Students in DC for an internship anyone?  Accepting bitcoin would attract them.  Also there is a **large** amount of free advertising that comes as a side effect of being the first one to do something with bitcoin, particularly in good ol' 'murrica.  If one of our whacky neighbors to the north can generate multiple articles for selling his house, your parents can generate many more for renting many houses/apartments/whatever :P.
Anyways, please pitch the idea it can't hurt.
as a student who may be in DC for an internship in the next calendar year I would LOVE to pay my rent in bitcoins.

I think it would be worth it for you to compare total network hashrate/mining difficulty to the exchange rate. Just to see what the statistical correlation has been.

i'm sure some people appreciate seeing it in equation form though. I wish they'd thought more in the long term for transaction fees. Though it's implicitly included in their concept of miner reward in the models, the growth of transaction fees as part of the miner reward varies not with time/network hashrate/difficulty but rather with total bitcoin transaction volume, which for years now has grown independently of the difficulty rising.
Just another side effect of their assumption that the entire bitcoin economy is *only* miners

sorry mate. your best bet is to paypal someone that trusts you IRL your paypal fairmoney, get some cash from said person. and find someone on localbitcoins who will sell you bitcoins for cash in person.
BTW&gt; i'm not sure what constitutes a Bitcoin emergency. Either you're jonesing for drugs, or you really want to buy some ASICMINER shares before div release. Either way you'll have to wait longer anyways because SR and Atlantis require delivery.. and 3btc will only buy you microshares and havelock is down right now.
try patience, and never mentioning paypal again

@_date: 2013-06-28 23:34:30
judging by the incredibly slow pace. I'm going to assume this is what happened.. They had connects with some suppliers that handled their FPGA stuff. all the money that went into developing their ASICs came from the preorders, and hence all that work didn't start until the preorders went in, and that's also when the delays began lol.
The funniest part is, I can remember when people thought that BFL hiring Inaba/Josh/asshat was a GOOD thing for the company, and a POSITIVE step forward in their PR.

If you for some reason really **need** the btc now at age 13, then go to localbitcoins meetup WITH your parents, and make sure your dad has a knife on him, you know just in case.
The better course of action would be to hold your bitcoin until you are old enough to understand it better.
Please do the latter..

localbitcoins is the most grassroot of ways to get bitcoin out there.
However, as many bitcoin dealers here know, the infrastructure such as coinbase is needed within a country before localbitcoins truly flourishes.
also, maybe it would be good for localbitcoins to set up a TRADE/BARTER section?
it would be *janky as fuck* to begin with, but has potential

The best way to do this sort of remittances, would be to buy bitcoins using USD, coinbase is very solid for getting usd into btc. At the other end in Germany, your friend should find his preferred way of "cashing" out his bitcoins. or better yet, convince him to keep them/spend them in kruezburg :P
a localbitcoins broker would be "best" in terms of anonymity but in the EU there's bitstamp and other services.

It's not necessarily the hoarder that will be "spending" the coins to USD every time. A diligent hoarder could only do btc transactions, and it could be the merchants [on their own timescale] that end up bringing the btc to the exchanges.
the point remains though, a treasure **is** going to be spent, which as a byproduct also lets us see how there aren't such things as hoarders in the btc economy, just slow leakers...

It's also possible that Satoshi sat down with a psychologist and economist and graphed out the release of x amount of bitcoins, and they chose x, such that with their predicted adoption rate, the usd/btc exchange rate would be in a reasonably, easy to say, exchange rate.

What parts of the bitcoin economy are you aware of? One aspect that is not going away and particularly highlights the things you can do with bitcoin that you can't do with anything else is the ever growing realm of bitcoin gambling.

**UPDATE UPDATE**
I'm surprised nobody has posted this yet: [ allows you to see ALL transactions associated with a bitcoin address, so I went ahead and analyzed all the addresses that lpkane has associated with his name.
- 50btc: 1NsEeuxWB4ZvjVrxZcsmeMktDJPG5m4NCn
- btc guild: 13X5R8tTGkvZnsvFd12AHqwpF2hp34QKUa
- slush pool: 1NLy5djpAeU7uVNQ8meLQ4CweFU1hNfkQP
But also, another one that we see from the screenshot
Let's start by saying, the addresses that he has listed from the 3 pools, do in fact show payments adding up to 29.27627734 as he claims.
Let's focus on slush's pool, where the screenshot discrepancy exists... 1AqTMY7kmHZxBuLUR5wJjPFUvqGs23sesr is clearly the address of slush's pool so we can verify that money came from there, likely the same user account. Especially since, as a slush user myself as well, you have to verify by email whenever you change your payment address. That was definitely a deliberate switch. 
However, the last address shows a payment of 1.02209525 made from slush's pool to the address shown in the second screenshot... which is then immediately sent out to this address, where it is **still** sitting: 1P7zPAeA3NSWk29XUfRa3ZpT8RHqtLG1c9
So that's the story of 1.02209525 btc not accounted for by lpkane already.
Next. from the 3 addresses listed, all coins made mining at the 3 pools paid out to those 3 addresses are then funneled/laundered to 1BCry6exqBj2XyCk4ZR3FkQam3jhHdNKYp
That address most definitely held the ~29 coins that lpkane is admitting to having mined on y'alls computers.  The thing is, there is no clear transaction from that address to an exchange's address, or something that resembles an exchanges address.  However, that is completely inconclusive and just an observation...
The last thing to note is that We can see that lpkane started mining on 4/13 and stopped this morning around 8:00AM EST... Which somewhat coincides with the posts on esea forums calling his ass out.
Well there you have it. The psuedononymous nature of bitcoin strikes again. :)
Please call out lpkane for the additional 1btc, and just for being a clear LYING ASSHOLE

Perhaps we'd have to start with determining the crossover rate between the two groups: bitcoin traders and bitcoin miners. That way your current data could be used :P

I have to disagree with the conclusion..


coin is not the xed, rule-driven, incentive-compatible system that some advo-
cates claim. Although miners currently follow the original rules, this behavior
is stable only by consensus and the rules could be changed at any time, either
by a Goldfinger-style attacker or by a consensus governance process.
**Goldfinger-style attack**
While there is ample thought given to the source of such an attack, there is little else..
I'm unable to get into the deeper economics of it right now but the gold-finger style attack model has some assumptions that are quite irrational.

i am really interested in seeing the growth of decentralized bitcoin exchanges outside of the United States.
The argument that "if all the people in the world tried to spend $1 on Bitcoin it would be worth x amount" is not even a valid thought experiment if over half the world doesn't have the ability to use an exchange because they don't have a bank account.  Let alone, if they can't even access an exchange because they don't have internet access.
just as an example, all this talk of m-pesa in kenya on this subreddit and the fact that mobile penetration in Africa is higher than bank and internet penetration is really really setting the stage for this.

If you just resolve your balance you'll be able to keep your current account. Your 500 is gone

Right... just because you were on your mac today doesn't mean you've always been 100% safe.
impossible to guess is also a very very relative term if your pw chocie has become known due to an offline attack.
This could even be an entirely different exploit on Bitstamp's end, assuming your complete 100% adherence to common sense.
anyways, you kept your money on an exchange.. your btc isn't secure unless you have it under control in a brainwallet, backed up, whatever whatever.
**tldr** your bitstamp and maybe your email got hacked, this has nothing to do with btc, sorry.

The best way for you, as a site, to get bitcoin. is to follow seals' example and accept deposits and withdrawals in bitcoin, and keeping the chip count tied to bitcoin not usd, that way you are avoiding issues with exchange rate. That is assuming your end goal is to keep a balance in bitcoin.
If your end goal is just to allow people to fund their account, denominated in USD, with Bitcoin. With exchange rates at withdrawal/deposit. Well you'll be running into many issues, and should definitely, as said, get more domain names.
But to answer what I think is your question. Suggest to your "users" to use coinbase to buy their bitcoins

mining should never be regulated. the pure decentralized and p2p nature of mining is one of the core tenants of bitcoin.
if large corporations control large portions of the mining power, they could possibly have disincentives to do something else; ie, doublespend.
Arguably, we have "large corporations" such as ASICMINER, which is almost exactly what you are talking about.  With the exception of a declared mission statement from Friedcat, along with historical data showing ASICMINER's willingness to stay under 51% of the network hashrate, and ALSO the selling of their own blades/erupters.  Likewise, Avalon selling their chips has the flavors of a potentially centralized large corp w mining powers staying true to the decentralized nature of bitcoin, and ESPECIALLY bitcoin mining

Bitcoin was designed that way to create an incentive structure for adoption.  Arguably, from Satoshi Nakamoto's own actions and words when he was active, he was very aware that Bitcoin would have a very nascent stage where it would need to be sheltered, protected, brought up, taught to walk teh silk road, etc. 
The conclusion that some sort of governance, beyond the "consensus driven stability" that we currently have, is inevitable is a stretch. Especially since the majority of the paper is demonstrating that miners, pools, transaction fees, and everything are currently operating at a nash equilibrium, but there are other nash equilibria in their model that aren't beneficial for Bitcoin.  And then conclude that without governance the incentive structure will deteriorate and we will flounder..
the self interest of all miners has been enough of a driving factor so far, pray tell why it won't continue to do so?
This is another time for that quote about Bitcoin and Wikipedia being things that only work in practice not theory, blahblahblah

1. credit, and other financial liberalizations allow for more efficient allocations of resources to the most efficient producers. Credit, in the form of a loan, combined with the fractional reserve banking system, is arguably responsible for the growth of GDPs around the world in recent centuries.  However, with credit [or financial **over**liberalization comes certain moral hazards, and results of said things.... great depression, 2008, etc.  The lending/financial/banking infrastructure of a country is more or less an indicator of how well their economy is/could be doing.
2. from 1. we see that the only viable argument for an inability to offer credit in a btc economy, is that infrastructure is lacking.
3. people here will show you that infrastructure is coming up, help build it

The incentive to purchase for some of the less consumerist people in the world is to have access to a money that will be worth more in a year not less. to have access to a money that won't be inflated wonton, seized by whim, or worse.. pegged to USD D:
On top of that, for a lot of these third worlders, just the fact that they can order something online from somebody elsewhere in world when paypal, visa, and mastercard explicitly forbid them from doing so.
for the majority of first worlders on reddit with their luxury time they can't even be bothered to use bitcoin for the 1.75-15% discount that some merchants will offer w/ bitcoin use.
and I'm sure someone else can chime in about sheeple that don't care if there are companies keeping track of your every purchase to target you... or more importantly the banks that look at your entire bank record to magically pump out a loan amount D:

There are actually a growing number of businesses that are able to pay their rent and electricity for such physical bills in bitcoin. but of course this begs your question of the elec or rent company converting back to fiat. but the example still has merit :P
a better example would be the plethora of online-only "bitcoin businesses"  these services, such as satoshidice, are purely bitcoin in and bitcoin out.  Furthermore, the costs associated with those businesses are domain registering and site hosting, along with all the associated development and security. all of these things are essentially the core of the market of things that you could buy with bitcoin since a year or two ago.
Your analysis is definitely correct for a majority of vendors, particularly relatively small ones.  However, they would still accept bitcoin transactions for any of the reasons above, particularly the lower fees part.  That would still support the entire bitcoin network, add transactions, add transaction fees, increase publicity/adoption, etc, etc. which would be reflected by a higher exchange rate

as mentioned by krillcoin.. you need hardware not software.

Mainstream economists do have an agenda, that agenda is with the status quo: the current archaic financial system.
The ones that do understand the superiority of bitcoin as a medium of exchange are likely to be too technically inept to understand Bitcoin's superiority as a store of value or as a unit of account.
A true understanding of Bitcoin comes from having one foot outside of government influence and the other foot firmly in internet and economic technicalities, and the fact of the matter is economists don't often become economists without being forced into Keynesian institutions.
The fact of the matter is most economists speaking badly about Bitcoin don't even understand the Internet.

tl;dr: make sure no flak from the LR scandal gets stuck in the words 'virtual currency', and to take jabs at finCEN's definitions of 'anonymous'.
1. liberty reserve was not a virtual currency
2. liberty reserve transactions were private as opposed to anonymous
3. the argument that LR's prohibitive fees when compared with Western Union and bank wires offers disincentives to legal users can be used to paints Western Union users as criminals in light of Bitcoin
4. tgb thinks the chance of bitcoin facing a fate like LR is less every day.

energy costs? these machines are getting more energy efficient not the other way around.
It is getting easier and easier for individuals to become individual bitcoin miners. as for whether or not it is getting more profitable, that's another bone to pick.
centralised mines; for instance, if we had 5 asicminer like companies as our mining network, is also one of my largest concerns. That stuff only happens in centralised governments with lobbying and congresses and shit though :P
Even in the case of 5 asicminer-like companies each with 20% of the network hashrate, they will stay at a nash equilibrium out of self interest, and mutually assured destruction, it's just average joes like you without a proper sense of game theory will be a tad bit more alarmed

you've laid out the path that progress will take. i agree with you.
i'm just pointing out that the most rural places in china are the places that the remittances have to go to. Yes there are over a hundred million chinese netizens just in Beijing and Shanghai. but they aren't the ones sending nor receiving remittances.  and guess what, those are the ones showing up on btcchina trade volume right now
The migrant workers in SEZs or the Fujianese waiter at your local chinese restaurant that owes 2000 manhours [to the triad] for his passage to the USA or UK doesn't have a bank account.. In China they're missing a hukou, in the US they're missing an SS
Yes bitcoin will solve many problems, but there are other ones in the way still

The way I understand the rolling out of their BTC for purchase is, they have a hard limit that refreshes after it is expended. the same way our daily limits do.  This means that every second there is a small amount &lt;.1 btc becoming available for purchase.  Everything else is just variance from when people are coming in and buying it.
For instance.  I can almost always get a .3btc buy in after a browser refersh.  I haven't been able to buy 10 coins at a time since usd/btc was in the 40s.
**tldr; coinbase's limits are like the daily limits they put on us, buy &lt;.5 at a time, you won't be able to get large amounts unless it's at weird hours**

while it's arguable that her umph to all the people she's asking about accepting bitcoin is more cuz she's writing an article forbes. however, i'm saying that her rules are not arbitrary and artificial. but designed to create this sensationalist effect.

@_date: 2013-03-25 14:49:48
so if i'm reading this correctly, your underlying assumption that is dead wrong is:
that bitcoin's value only comes from "external people buying bitcoin with dollars, euros, etc.
There is a market for transactions solely in bitcoins. and this exists because people value what bitcoin has to offer over traditional fiat currencies.
1) lower fees, 2) faster transaction times, 3) 0 fraud if done properly, 4) psuedo anonymity if done properly.
If you can't think of reasons why people would want to use bitcoin besides buying it to sell later, then GTFO

ohhh how i have pondered this question over many a time.
with current CPUs and GPUs the heat is just too high unless you had a 60gallon aquarium for your computer. Also, the modern chipsets on mobos have holes that allow mineral oil to get behind your chip and not circulate, essentially the heat isn't uniformly distributed and damage occurs :(.
for ASICs though, this is some next level shit!

I have put money into both of those, and as chalash mentioned, price of bitcoin denominated assets usually go down as usd/btc exchange rate rises.
However, that trend is arguably lessening as market forces outweigh panicked nooblets with a small sense of liquidity

I am providing a node for bitcoin transactions to go through. I am verifying your transactions, albeit much less efficiently than others. Your leap to comparing a jalapeño in 5 years to a cpu now is only valid in respect to those lovely numbers you crunched. You should work on your grammar first btw.
If the value of the bitcoin network, to me, is infinity (this is the case for many people as bitcoin is not just some monies... it is a MOTHERFUCKING PARADIGM SHIFT) then providing even a fraction of a ten thousandth of a % of the total network hashrate to help secure the future is worth it.

if you came to bitcoin because it is a global digital currency then stick to your guns. If the US makes moves to "make it illegal" there are plenty of other countries out there that are doing the opposite.

people have posted the announcement from ASRock which has absolutely no relevant information, this is actual analysis of their claims
@_date: 2013-04-22 16:05:22
We, as the voice of the internetz..., NEED to demand this.
Let me specify what this is:
A major online retailer having that KILLER MUST HAVE item on cyber monday, and they plan for it so they have a LOT in stock, and then they need to announce that they are ONLY accepting btc. ie, setting the first "peg" for our luverly online currency.
Just as an example, imagine if Sony releases the PS4, and only accepts payments of btc, and sets a price of 1btc.  Y'all might think that at current prices 1btc for a ps4 is a steal, but imagine how quickly bitcoin prices would rise as a result.  Just the MERE announcement of some product would lead to everybody and their mother [buying one for their kids] buying bitcoins, so they could avoid a line, and buy this shiny new product that is only available in bitcoins.
Now imagine if Sony bought significant amounts of bitcoin right before the announcement.. lol
