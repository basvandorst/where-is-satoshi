Binance is using 20% of their profit to buyback and burn BNB.  They've pumped more than $128m of their profit into BNB buybacks since July 2017.  
It has more upside potential than equity.  The problem with equity is it requires too much KYC to hold/transfer.   
 Equity is not useful as a currency.  
BNB has millions of people using it as a currency for paying trading fees on Binance.  Anyone with a smartphone and some cash can buy BTC from a peer, then trade it for BNB without KYC.  
BNB will capture 100% of the value from Binance's DEX, and Binance equity will capture 0%.

It's one of their dumbest arguments because it doesn't consider market depth / liquidity.
  
BTC still dominates the market depth, especially in the OTC market:

Even if you wanted to sacrifice liquidity and diversify into shitcoins, the top 10 coins have more than 80% of the market depth and volume.
  
BTC is the only coin with enough liquidity to move large amounts like $50m+ without too much slippage.
  
There is a limited supply of coins that have sufficient market depth / liquidity.
