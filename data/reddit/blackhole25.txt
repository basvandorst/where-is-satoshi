OpenBazaar can't come quick enough.

Selling Bitcoins isn't money laundering!
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:57:24
Wasn't this reported months ago?
@_date: 2014-11-07 18:45:23
Too bad they started the fight by banning people from tipping people.

Most likely a Ponzi scheme, but would like to know too.

SELLING BITCOIN IS NOT A CRIME!
@_date: 2014-11-08 06:44:14
You sound as if you don't want people being tipped for awesome photos.

Circle really needs to sort this out. This doesn't aspire confidence nor show trust.

**THERE IS NO LAW STATING THAT YOU CANNOT BUY AND THEN SELL BITCOIN!!!!!!!!!!**
I guess all of you people who trade on LocalBitcoins and the Trade section of the BitcoinTalk forum are breaking the rule. Guess I'm gonna have to report those users to the FBI.

Switch to Android. Yep, I said it LOL.

Mine alt coins and exchange them to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-11 02:05:04
No. Just verify yourself, add a bank account, and then purchase your first amount of Bitcoins from Coinbase and wait 30 days. After a month, you'll then be able to purchase instantly.  
   
   
To answer your question, normal transfers (non-verified) usually take 3-4 BUSINESS days, due to the ACH that Coinbase uses.

True, but it's a false belief that Chrome isn't open source. 
While Chrome itself isn't open source, it's based off an open source project.

Same thing with PayPal.

I can't believe that we're the only two. I just love how the whiteknights are claiming "it's only a scam if they take money". Scams, or **Confidence Tricks**, can be done even without money. (Like telling someone that store "A" has product "B" when it doesn't.)

Wow, the amount of ITT is fucking insane.  
  
What law did he break exactly? **There's no law stating that you can't sell Bitcoin!** If there was, then the "Buy and Sell" section on BitcoinTalk wouldn't even exist. The only reason this guy got arrested is that he aided the destruction of the corrupt legacy banking system. His arrest is an attempt to silence the Bitcoin community.  
  
inb4 "the truth gets down voted to shit."
@_date: 2014-12-20 04:58:27
What law? The law that says you can't buy and then sell Bitcoins for cash? Oh, wait..... That law doesn't exist.

I'm having a problem with Circle too.
I cannot purchase coins whatsoever. I connected a debit card and whenever I try to purchase, I get the "we're working on your card" message.
@_date: 2014-11-07 07:09:24
It's based off Chromium, which is open source.
@_date: 2014-11-09 18:26:47
So?
