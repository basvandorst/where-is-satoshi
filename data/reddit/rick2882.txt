Yeah before you (and this goes for me too!) understand how to extract your bcash from a paper wallet, KEEP IT IN THERE. Do not transfer it to Coinbase or anywhere else just yet. Your btc and bcash is safe in an offline wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:56:24


No you cannot. It's a little trickier to claim bitcoin cash from a bitcoin paper wallet, and someone else can probably explain better ways of doing it (I'm quite a noob too). The way I plan to do it is exporting the bcash keys from  the bitcoin paper wallet through blockchain.info, but again, hopefully somebody more proficient will post a good step-by-step way of doing this.

@_date: 2017-12-21 17:36:04
Yes and yes. 
To your latter question, however, not necessarily every exchange or online wallet, but Coinbase and Blockchain.info both support both bitcoin and bitcoin cash. All bitcoin you owned on offline wallets (paper wallet, trezor, etc) before the fork is now equal to bitcoin + bitcoin cash (for example, 0.25 btc before the fork = 0.25 btc + 0.25 bch after the fork).
It really is amazing that the price of btc did not tank after the fork for this exact reason. We basically got free money.

What is needed right now is something revolutionary that will make bitcoin more mainstream. Buying/mining bitcoins and transferring them to paper wallets and cold storage will never become mainstream - it's frankly too complicated and technical. Think Facebook, think Kindle; these are the kind of things the average person on the street "gets". Build something that is useful, uses the bitcoin protocol, and doesn't require the user to mine or buy bitcoins (the user should just deal with fiat, and volatility of BTC shouldn't affect him/her).

The biggest problem with bitcoin right now is that it's "too complicated" and not many people want to deal with it. If these students are past the first phase (getting somewhat familiar with it), most of them will hang on to at least a few. $100 is nothing for many of these students, and it will be worth saving a little bitcoin (if not all).

Let me explain why a log chart makes *more* sense than a linear chart when looking at fluctuations. Suppose we're living in a time when 1 BTC = 1 USD, and you have $1000 worth of BTC (so, basically 1000 BTC). Now let's say the value of bitcoin doubles so that 1 BTC = $2. You have now doubled the worth of your holdings to $2000! Now imagine a time when 1 BTC = $1000, and you again own $1000 worth of bitcoin (so, 1 BTC). And again BTC doubles to being worth $2000. You have again doubled your net holding's worth to $2000.
In both cases, you have made an identical profit. Yet, the first case would barely be noticeable on a linear graph, while the second case would look like a HUGE peak. This is why log scales are useful. It is a better representation of how much the value of your BTC has increased or decreased (i.e. by how many *times*: 2X, 10X, 0.5X...).

I don't blame people for predicting that the value of 1 BTC would crash to ~$100-200 (pre-bubble price). The huge rise in value was clearly a bubble, and there was no reason to believe that the value would continue to follow the trend line. I don't even blame Mark Williams for his prediction. However, a man in his position of authority (finance professor at a reputable university) has predicted a near-complete collapse of bitcoin, and thus implied that it is fundamentally flawed. He made a bold claim, and I'm simply calling him out (although he does have a month to be proven right).

As much as we would like to believe that bitcoin gives us unprecedented control of our own money, we NEED companies to make bitcoin more user-friendly, and Coinbase is possibly the most trustworthy such company out there.
Tl;dr. If we can't even trust coinbase, don't bother buying bitcoin at current prices.

I don't understand the basis of your question, though. Take comfort from what?

If anything, I would expect the value to remain stable (~$800-900) for 6 or 7 months before we see another steep increase in value.
So no, we don't need to take comfort from last year's value. BTC is doing pretty well.

In fact, it's the other way around. The fact that there will only be 21 million requires that if bitcoin does go mainstream, the value of 1 BTC will be in the thousands of dollars. A "stable" bitcoin value in the hundreds is just not possible (because that would require only a consistently small number of people to use bitcoin, without an increase in the number of users). If bitcoin goes mainstream, the value of 1 BTC will be in the thousands; if it doesn't, it will continue to be highly volatile in the hundreds.

It really depends on what you want to calculate.
Imagine you have $1000 worth of bitcoin. If the price (say, in USD) of bitcoin doubles, you now have $2000 worth of BTC *regardless of the actual price per BTC*. To see how your wealth (in USD) is changing, you want to look at the log chart, because whether the price goes from $5 to $10 per BTC, or from $500 to $1000, the effects are the same: you double your wealth.
Now imagine you have 5 BTC, each worth $500. If the price doubles you still have 5 BTC, each now worth $1000. Therefore, you've made a $2500 profit ($5000 - 2500). If instead, the price went from $5 to $10, and you still only had 5 BTC, you would have only made a $25 profit. If you want to know how much profit you've made in absolute value for a given amount of bitcoin, then you look at the linear graph, because now it matters what the USD price per BTC is. 
@_date: 2016-02-27 21:30:34

The distance between the Earth and Moon, and the length of a football field are both *lengths*. They can be compared. Would you say the a speed of 100 m/s is greater than a distance of 50 m? Does that even make sense? It probably does to you because you seem to lack this basic comprehension of the meaninglessness of comparing entities of different units. Amount of bitcoins, and the number of bitcoins per unit time cannot be compared.


No. What Roger Ver is talking about is not $38 billion worth of bitcoin, but $38 billion worth of bitcoin being used in a year. Please try to understand the difference. Please spend a few minutes to understand how "a year" is completely arbitrary. This is the logic being used: 






Do you not see the flaw in the logic here? Firstly it assumes that bitcoin isn't being used like cash or a credit card, but as a commodity (Amazon takes the bitcoin and doesn't convert it to fiat). Secondly, it assumes these bitcoins are already bought as opposed to simply being used as a way to transfer money (like Western Union). There's just so much wrong with these comparisons. Total amount of transanctions per unit time and the total worth of allof that currency is unrelated.

Log scales give an accurate representation of *by how much* the value of bitcoin has changed. If the BTC value falls from $10 to $1, that's a huge deal (10-fold decrease), but would be hardly noticeable as a small blip on a linear scale (only a $9 difference). In a log scale, a fall from $10 to $1, and a fall from $1000 to $100, would look identical.
Linear and log scales give different information. It depends on what *you* want to see represented.


It would look terrible.
@_date: 2015-02-13 19:51:04
The numbers *are* arbitrary though. Roger Ver is comparing cash flow within an arbitrary amount of time (a year) to the market cap of a commodity. It doesn't make any sense. Why compare bitcoin's market cap with how much Amazon nets per year? Why not a week or a decade? This is not even an apples and oranges comparison; this is an apples and squirrels comparison. Bitcoin's market capitalization should be compared to market caps of companies (like Amazon's *market cap*, which interestingly is a much higher $175 billion), or to the total value of other commodities (like gold or oil).
@_date: 2015-02-13 21:55:54


I don't believe so, but maybe someone can correct me if I'm wrong. When you ask for the price of 1 BTC, you're treating it as a stock or a commodity, like a store of value. You can therefore only compare it with the market cap of a company or the total worth of a commodity or a nation's total currency. To compare it's usefulness with that of Visa or Western Union, you'd have to measure the dollars (or any other fiat) per unit time being used or transferred via bitcoin. The value of 1 BTC in this case is irrelevant.
@_date: 2015-02-15 05:07:30

I'm holding on to mine, although if this bubble is similar to the previous one, I expect the value of 1 BTC to go as low as $400-$500 before staying stable there for a few (possibly 6-7) months, before another significant increase. I think it's important to recognize, though, that this was indeed a bubble. So far I've spent a little less than $250 on 250 mBTCs. There's no way I'm selling them now.
