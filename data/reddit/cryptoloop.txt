It is also very weird to me that local bitcoin groups which certainly consist of indivuals with different opinions make statements like these.

Currently 86% of the hashpower are supporting Segwit2x.

Is nobody here confused why heterogeneous groups like this would make a statement that pretends that they have all the same opinion?

There has been absolutely no consensus for segwit1x. It never got more than 30% support and required 95% for activation. 
Segwit1x has only been activated after the New York Agreement added an additional 2x blocksize increase.

I have the feeling that there is a similar chance that you make a stupid mistake with the paper wallet compared to the chance that the exchange will be hacked.

The light travel time between earth and mars is around 10 minutes on average.
Thus, the planet with the most hashrate would define the blockchain. There might be some occasional chain reorgs if the minority planets' chain acquires more pow during mars' closest approach to earth  (3min light travel time).

Then the humble way would be to just publish the results of this vote.

But what if I have 0.28 BTC and the price increases by $ 63? Am I losing money?

Very good article that actually shows both sides of the debate.
Worth to read.

With Electrum you can generate a transaction with a watch-only wallet on an online computer, transfer it to the offline computer for signing and then transmit it with the online computer.

So your conspiracy theory is that they just want bigger blocks as a test run to see whether they can control bitcoin? 
And then later they unravel their real evil masterplan to destroy bitcoin?

Some good information can be found in the glacier protocol:

Get your news from different sources and make your own opinion. 
Don't listen to people who call the other side "burglers" and "scammers". They are the ones who make the whole debate toxic.

From the various sources I have seen my guess is ~30% of the users support 2x. However, online discussion is strongly skewed and unreliable.
@_date: 2017-10-26 09:06:00
Yes, and also some online forum for discussions would be nice.

Yes, hardware wallets are simpler to handle than paper wallets.
