At a young age I believe there's an Age card scheme for helping young people prove their age for getting into the pubs (you need to be 18 to drink), but you are not obliged to have one or to carry any ID on you as a UK citizen. It's difficult for the police if they are checking people they've stopped, they would check the details you give them over the radio to the central computer, if you don't happen to have ID and they're suspicious, the police may choose to take a young person home to verify their identity or anyone else could be taken to the station until they're sure they're who they say they are, but if you've committed a crime or are on bail and give a false name to the police to try to evade justice it's a very serious offence in itself that carries up to 6 months in prison (although normally it would be a suspended sentence unless it's not the first time). Even if you're driving you don't have to carry your driving licence with you as you have 7 days to produce it on request by the police along with other documents, although they can check whether a car is insured now instantly and will seize the vehicle if it's not.

There is a very big issue if you don't drive and you don't happen to travel abroad like many thousands of legitimate UK residents who are getting treated as 2nd class citizens because they don't have photo ID, not just with bitcoin, but in numerous other ways.

No there are no national ID cards in the UK although they've been talking about bringing them in it's a long way off. In the UK the only accepted photo ID is a passport or driving licence which loads of people don't have as neither are mandatory, so when Bitcoin exchanges insist on them they're excluding a large proportion of UK citizens from their services and using Bitcoin is extremely difficult indeed. You can still use LocalBitcoins although some sellers / buyers there can even ask for ID and I believe there's very low limits at BitQuick, otherwise there's sites like CoinChimp that have less than reputable reviews and masses of complaints with people losing their BTC (E.g. they're a suspected scam site) so people without photo ID need to be extra careful.
