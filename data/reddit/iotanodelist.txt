Correct. They can make money on the spread, but there are also transaction fees, or commissions if you want to call it that.  Exchange fees are separate.
Edit to add: open outcry market makers, or specialist, used to thrive solely on the bid/ask spread of what they were trading.  When the decimals replaced fractions in prices, that spread narrowed; and consequently, a lot of people couldn't survive.  Those spreads narrowed further over time, making it extremely difficult to survive on the spread.  Most places now that still use a live market maker work with some type of commission structure in place.

nope.  the exchanges put out daily 'open interest' reports which show how many contracts are open.  that's about as close as you'll get.  there is no way for the public to see trades in real-time.

Not sure why you were downvoted for asking a legitimate question.
For every market transaction - whether equities, fx, fixed income, whatever - there is a buyer and a seller.  Someone must take the other side of the trade.  Futures are no different.
What happens for futures is you have a liquidity provider (e.g. market maker) who takes the other side, then will try to hedge himself either by find someone else with an opposite order or by going long/short the underlying itself. His goal is to manage as large an order book as possible while also taking as little risk as possible.  Typically, he’ll make his money on transaction fees.

A) they are publicly building the trading desk.  They announced it months ago.
B) they’re right.  Most coins will go to zero.  all you have to do is look at the survivor rate of tech companies from the 90s.

Who’s comparing bitcoin to those companies?  The statement is that most icos will go to zero, and the comparison is all the tech companies that failed in the  dot com bubble.  Just as you said, those companies had no revenue and were just ways to separate investors from their money - so are a ton of icos now.  I mean, you can really look at any advancing technology through history.  There used to be thousands of car manufacturers, then as technology advances and some companies were better able to utilize that technology, they gained market share and all the others went out of biz.  It’s how new markets, like the current crypto market, develop.  Most fail.  It’s not some big new idea, but it gets a lot of clicks as a headline.
