1. Install electrum from electrum.org
2. Create a new wallet, WRITE DOWN YOUR SEED.
3. Create a strong password but don't worry about remembering this long term, only your seed matters.
4. Send money to your recieving addresses.
5. Delete wallet file off computer.
6. Restore your wallet balance in 20 years from your seed and just your seed. Keep it safe or memorize it, it's only 12 words long.

Can't exactly memorise an armory seed...

If you use the electrum bitcoin client you can restore your entire wallet by just saving a 12 word long string. Try it out electrum.org, just remember to write down your seed and keep it safe.

Bitcoin becomes the killer of traditional remittence companies only when you can send your relatives bitcoin and they can buy their food with it.

Electrum is awesome! I can walk around the earth with an entire deterministic wallet stored in my head and engraved on metal in the earth? Fuck yeh

Buy from btcmarkets.net (its an actual exchange unlike coinjar) 
And store your bitcoins with electrum from electrum.org
With electrum your entire balance is backed up to 12 words, no data to save onto a USB just 12 words to write down safe
@_date: 2014-09-20 17:01:32
This would be awesome.
