oh snap son, homes be talking shit about your spelling!... Learn to spell before you judge a site!
@_date: 2014-02-08 05:14:03
Im glad at least someone is finally working to replace BitMit...I support the cause even if it is a beta

I like coinbase allot. I never had a problem with it. But besides trading directly between people I think you are going to have to deal with bank accounts. Worst part is you have to wait 5 days....some of the auctions sites somestimes have people list bitcoins for sale directly from individuals but I dont know if that helps read above for some examples.

Finally!!!! Thank God, I missed BitMit so much
@_date: 2014-02-06 02:31:21
Looks Good im excited. I was sad since BitMit died, looks comporable. I listed my jeep up on there but it just opened up so not too many auctions
@_date: 2014-03-11 01:07:33
I like Coinbase for an exchange personally.

I posted something on there I just put the voucher code in at the bottom of one of the auction setup page and it didnt charge me. The banner at the bottom says 0.01 BTC listings so maybe thats normal? I thought it looked decent though maybe once people start using it.

Read your chain ^^^
For auctions: cryptothrift or distractedpuppy
I heard amazon may be at one point...
@_date: 2014-02-11 03:23:40
Hahaha Swagtropolis INC I like this site already.    I think they need to get some listings up though and 0.01 BTC is a bit much for a listing...Though I like the effort.

I know I can't believe the bitmit is gone! I used to sell all kinds of stuff on there!
I read that a new BTC auction site just launched this week
[u] suppossedly literally just opened
I looked around a little looks like a beta but looks promising! Maybe there is hope  ;D
@_date: 2014-03-04 02:22:53
Yea kind of 90's but for 0.002 BTC a listing it sure beats our cryptothrift so I'll take it!
@_date: 2014-02-11 02:36:14
I support the cause!
@_date: 2014-02-06 00:46:04
At first glance it actually looks pretty good. Clearly a Beta, but i'll probably list a thing or two on there....
I support the cause anyway...someone needs to make an auction site that actually works...well see how this one does
@_date: 2014-02-07 23:21:51
Looks Good. Im glad something finally replaced BitMit.
@_date: 2014-02-18 01:39:29
@_date: 2014-02-05 02:07:04
Interesting...well I support the cause at least! Good effort will give a go. Now that BitMit is gone anyway....
@_date: 2014-03-11 02:12:27
cryptocafe is pretty good...looks professional.
how much is it though to list? distractedpuppy is dirt cheap
@_date: 2014-02-07 02:39:43
Looks Decent. Clearly a Beta but I'm glad someone is pushing this. 
@_date: 2014-02-05 10:06:43
Thank God.
