My question isn't about blockchain or related technologies. It's about cryptoCURRENCIES (bitcoin is this case) and their future. Yeah, I could've googled it but I wanted to see more people's point of view. If you're sick of this you could've downvoted and scrolled past.

I sold it on Coinbase instead of transferring then bought LTC/ETH instead. Much better imo

Where did I say I believed them, I presented their prediction and was asking for opinions.

I meant as in taking down major exchanges, global illegalization, mis-information, pump and dump. Track down the creator and make him do some stupid shit. They will never fully take it down, but can make almost impossible for the average person to use it.

Like what?
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:21:20
1.) You don't think China or Russia will do anything.
2.) You think only the US will do something.
3.) All three will do something.
4.) One of them will do something.
Which one? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:05:26
Are you implying that your building something.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:13:48
Long term to hold.

The people, or its bank/government.

THANK YOU! I like how you kind of ELI5'ed, I get the basics now. Thanks.

This is kind of long again, but I'm starting to get it. 
-If Bitcoin is generated only by mining how can it ever become *BIG". Since you can't work for it(like a job, cashier, engineer and such)or can't pay taxes with it or get bit paychecks.
- Wouldn't the person with the most/best processing power get more Bitcoins?
- Is it just meant for small/private transactions on the internet and such?
-So there are public servers that host the bit coin source code/protocol, and if someone breaks that rule the computer can tell when they try to spend it.
-Is there no way to prevent something like Mt.Gox, there is no FDIC so how do you know ur money is safe? 
-Also can the rules only change if the majority allows it to?

Wow, thank you! :)
@_date: 2016-12-26 06:31:27
So much info thanks! 
@_date: 2016-12-26 06:32:51
Have you already learnt it? If so, please help.
@_date: 2016-12-26 17:43:26
You guys are fuckin' amazing, thanks for bearing with my dumb ass.

They destroyed Iraq and Libya to protect the petrodollar, NSA/CIA and other three-letter will have no problem destroying Bitcoin with enough motivation.

It depends what you determine the success of Bitcoin on. Do you determine it on Carlos in Mexico and Johnny in Holland being able to trade secretly because they know how to get around the rules or Sally the soccer mom being able to buy groceries with it.

Destroying Bitcoin will destroy the US economy?

Yeah maybe, but Wall Street and Tel Aviv have destroyed entire countries to protect the dollar and I'm sure they're aren't afraid to do it again.
@_date: 2017-11-25 04:50:16
Destroying the internet would make the whole world collapse, but regulating would just give ((them)) more power.
@_date: 2017-11-25 03:38:54
The government can do anything if they actually care, the NSA/CIA/FBI had vast sophisticated surveillance apparatuses for years without us knowing. The U.S. started wars that killed millions of innocents to protect the dollar, they will chase Bitcoin to the ends of the earth if/when they see it as a threat.

Impossible to regulate not to destroy.
@_date: 2017-11-25 03:51:16
With enough motivation the U.S. can significantly damage if not destroy Bitcoin.
