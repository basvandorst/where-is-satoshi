Welcome to r/iamverysmart
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:17:36
So that happened. Good story bro. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:16:36
One beholden to their sales division?
@_date: 2016-04-25 00:05:38
You can be a tycoon instead of just a soothsayer if you had the balls to short. 
@_date: 2016-04-11 14:33:46
But what else are they going to write shit articles about?
@_date: 2016-04-25 01:10:28
I don't. I'm just calling you out. You don't happen to happen to have a very similar Xbox live username do you?
@_date: 2016-04-25 01:26:15
Just checking. I knew somebody that had a similar username to yours. 
@_date: 2016-04-23 03:16:18
It's such a trash publication. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:58:44
I think he is recommending an accountant for either. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 01:57:06
That's a terrible analogy. Alex Jones is doing things that endanger other inocent people. Those books in Germany did no such thing. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 01:16:04
It's also not government enforcement. It's the hand of the free market. It's owners of venues using their right to expell someone from their property. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:27:11
 Pretty sure anybody can post up a Forbes contributor article too. At least it seams that way judging by the quality of those pieces. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 01:26:41
Except the courts ruled in the baker's favor in the end. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 04:17:51
That's bullshit. Every private company censorship. Why do you think AJ was not in a major network? It's not because he isn't bringing in views. It's because he is a liability to be associated with. AJ is perfectly capable of posting a video on his own site. If internet providers start blocking him then I'd worry. Until then this is a lot of drama about nothing.
@_date: 2018-09-22 16:02:53
I don't censor except...
Proving my point. 
@_date: 2015-12-12 04:46:04
If you are a hodl'er this is :)
@_date: 2018-09-22 04:24:09
Right. I mean Alex Jones is even scared of his own fans. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 01:10:45
I have to agree. The meme doesn't really sound app imho. He can still say whatever the hell he want. He just isn't allowed to use private stages to do so.
@_date: 2018-09-22 01:14:26
This isn't censorship. It's is venues deciding to not have distasteful performers. If there was a local theater I don't get to demand that I put on a show that everybody hates. The venue is perfectly within their rights to tell me they don't want to put on my show. That's not censorship. It's free market. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 04:12:37
If that censorship was against somebody who was actually pushing truth to power it would bother me. However these actions were against somebody who was pushing his viewers to harass innocent people. And I support these companies making that choice 100%.
@_date: 2018-09-22 04:44:40
Yes he did call for them to be harassed. And any corporation would be perfectly reasonable to cut ties with the man. I don't see a conflict in my position. I'm ok with YouTube booting Alex Jones and I'm also ok with him still having his own website to push his crazy. If ISP's start blocking him that's when we have a problem. Until then this is just businesses not wanting stink on them which is completely reasonable. Does your position change with the fact that he has been calling for the harassment of parents who've lost their children?  
@_date: 2018-09-22 03:57:14
I mean I understand it's possible but then I look at what a rediculous far fetched idea it is and brush it aside for the much more logical conclusions. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 01:22:14
This. I don't get why so many people cry censorship. I don't get to demand that I put a show on at any stage I like. It's the free market.
@_date: 2015-12-12 04:48:05
We're still up 2% over 24 hours. This was simply some whales cashing out a bit. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 03:03:55
It's not unusual at all. Are you that limited on critical thinking. They all fell like dominoes because nobody wanted to be the bag holder. Bitcoin doesn't support AJ. Bitcoin doesn't support anyone. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 01:24:13
That's what happens when you build your "empire" on somebody else's stage.

Thanks!!! Have a happy new year!
@_date: 2018-09-22 02:00:36
Well it certainly isn't the current presidential admin. I'd be happy to change my stance if you could show me evidence of your hypothetical but  until then it's a conspiracy theory. Funny that's probably why you are defending AJ. Must be prone to conspiracy theories.
@_date: 2015-12-15 20:30:05
Also gotta say 'forcibly' to make it more dramatic. Did they actually have thugs strong arm you? Sounds like forcibly removed means being voted out. No wonder the foundation is failing with such drama queens on the board.

Who doesn't?
Merry Christmas!!!

These fucking nubs coming in and complaining about subs. It's fucking stupid. "Hey this sub doesn't seem to be submitting and upvoting content I like. Surely complaining about it will change everything despite the hundreds of other complaints about the same fucking thing in this sub."

Can we get our early adopter t-shirts now?
@_date: 2018-05-16 21:47:14
Oh Jesus not this again. 
There are subs for more serious discussion. If you don't like the memes then don't come to this sub. The memes won't stop and the more you tight them the more memes you get. 
Edit; it's like these complaints about memes post are becoming a meme unto themselves. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 01:17:54
I wish I could get paid big bucks to speak for large financial institutions and still get easily researched facts wrong.
@_date: 2014-12-23 01:08:08
You just perfectly summed up why about 50% of comments online about Brand start with "I'm not really a fan of Russel Brand".

How about a video that I think does a pretty good job of that?

Yeah! Cryptocurrency is all about trust in corporations. /s

You jerk off in a corner and sob. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 22:35:43
I didn't think about that. Good thing I've been with credit unions for a couple decades.

They had it for 300 on bitcoin black Friday. So the cheapest way to get an xbone this holiday season was with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 22:47:20
Yeah that's much better. I just bought my first bitcoin this week and mycelium seemed confusing as hell to me. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 05:44:55
No. I agree with you. Bitcoin is crashing. I bet its worth $10 by Friday. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 07:03:29

I called the last 2 weeks stable and got jokes made at me. Never mind the actual fact that we have been much flatter than a long while. I just hope we see a bit of a flattening trend. A more stable rise in value seems to be what bitcoin needs.

That's the takeaway you get from Brand? You seem to miss the part where he speaks out against the government and their cronies at the heads of large corporations. Your summary of what Brand and Moore stand for is completely wrong and you miss the entire point.

There was a post in r/android where a guy commented on using bitcoin to get the same wow factor as using nfc payments. He got downvoted to oblivion for this totally benign comment. I can't imagine that was normal.
@_date: 2014-11-21 17:57:05
I think I already properly refuted you. I'm just declaring my reasoning for exiting the conversation. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 14:43:48
Your point?
@_date: 2014-11-21 17:28:53
So there it is. You're obviously just here to try and doom &amp; gloom r/bitcoin. I just gave you a practical solution to your thesis problem and you poo poo it because 'bitcoin is doomed'. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 20:06:44
Oh I don't make any claims about where bitcoin value is headed. I think 10k in a few months is highly unlikely. I could see 10k in 5-10 years maybe. 
And I wish I had 2 bitcoin.

Sorry I should have said relatively.

I could imagine retailers going that low as well. But not having to fight crowds is a huge advantage?

I'm not sure that's fair. It sounds like a honest although uninformed question. Id suggest you take it as a chance to educate rather than alienate.

@_date: 2014-11-21 17:13:49
You just showed your naivete. You don't need to launch a full blow service to cover an entire region. You can privately do it for people you are close with. If you actually start making money you could expand but just helping a few people would be a vector for introducing the possibility of bitcoin to these people.  
@_date: 2014-12-17 06:05:55
Don't side chains offer the solution to that problem? The can have all the benefits of a centralized security system and still tie into the block chain.
@_date: 2014-10-25 06:04:13
I was actually mostly being a smart ass. But if they want me involved in their cryptocurrency it better be open source. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 21:30:17
There is an institution behind it. Its just not the typical idea of institution. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 15:46:53
Haha. I can tell by the down vote that you called out a red piller accurately.  
@_date: 2014-11-22 14:10:43
Great video. Thanks. 
@_date: 2014-11-22 09:22:06
I'm new to bitcoin myself. What is the easiest and most secure way to do this? Can you point me to a tutorial? 
@_date: 2014-12-17 05:39:50
So don't store your bitcoin in an exchange. Yay! Problem solved.
@_date: 2014-11-28 22:40:51
The reviews don't seem too hot. Seems like its doesn't have the best fail rate. I would have picked it up otherwise. 
@_date: 2014-10-25 05:42:13
Exactly. I feel kind of weird even talking about it to people out IRL. It doesn't mean I believe less in the possibilities of bitcoin. It just means society is painfully oblivious as a whole. And that is the status quo not just in regards to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-11-27 06:00:20

If you weren't so short sighted you could make a fortune providing this service to your fellow migrant workers. If you are indeed a migrant worker I'm sure you know others who are looking to send money back home and would prefer to pay as little as possible to do so. So set up an exchange account and exchange their cash for bitcoin they can send back home. Take a small fee and feel good about saving some money for your fellow migrant worker.  
@_date: 2014-12-05 01:20:43
Eh, the business was already there. It was just diverted to a new outlet very quickly.

No shit. Its a very immature product that has tremendous potential. It is also easier to trade than just about anything else in history so there's that. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 18:36:34
You're so fucking dense. You don't have to start a business. I mentioned how it is possible for you to provide a service to people who are close to you. Your response is asking why you would want to start an unsustainable business. Just because you don't have the capitol to start a business doesn't mean bitcoin does not provide a viable utility for migrant workers if they had access. 
@_date: 2014-12-01 15:12:58
I think it would be great if some bitcoin business sponsored esport teams or events. 
@_date: 2014-12-23 02:55:06
Haha. They aren't promoting poverty? You are seriously missing the point of their stances.

@_date: 2017-02-24 00:40:02
Do you realize Trump wishes to raise capital gains tax? That would be terrible for bitcoiners.
@_date: 2017-02-18 02:46:33
Shhh, you are talking to the anarchist bitcoiners from r/t_d.
@_date: 2017-02-20 01:43:41
That's OK. They are allowed to have a different opinion. I just happen to think it's silly when kiddies first instinct is that nobody knows this and I must post about it. 
@_date: 2017-02-18 02:44:21
Do you realllllly think the majority 50+ populace that voted him in did so on the influence of memes? 
Edit; Seriously I keep on hearing this shit and it's stupid. It's like an edgy teenager trope to say Trump won because of dank memes. Get a fucking clue.
@_date: 2017-02-19 22:19:35
Browsing my bank account when I find some really old news I decide reddit wants to hear again. 
@_date: 2017-02-20 00:14:14
Well thank God you posted it instead of taking a moment to see if "it's a thing".
@_date: 2015-05-21 23:47:30
Eh. It might be cheaper to use the utility of the bitcoin blockchain than running your own. 
@_date: 2017-02-22 17:49:10
How about he incorrectly corrected some bodies grammar on national television. That takes a real special type of idiot. 
@_date: 2017-02-18 02:35:33
So what he said then? Your two comments seem to contradict each other. Your first comment is that this made you laugh then you got disappointed by the political discussion. Your second comment is that you are here for bitcoin related discussion specifically. If the part about being here for bitcoin discussion is to be believed then why venture into a comment thread of a gif that simply made you laugh but obviously wasn't designed to invoke serious discussion about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 05:29:00
What does this mean?
@_date: 2017-02-20 14:27:33
Nah, I only get bugged by dumbass post, not comments. 
@_date: 2017-02-17 19:41:09
Once or twice is funny but every day there are post about how Trump is some godsend for Bitcoin. It's not fucking true and we shouldn't foster the idea. If he actually makes a statement about Bitcoin that would be different but setting him up as some kind of Bitcoin god is sad. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 11:10:28
Brains have been drained alright. 
@_date: 2017-02-17 19:42:21
I doubt he has ever even mentioned Bitcoin. These Trump post here are a sad joke. 
@_date: 2017-02-17 14:26:05
You're not really that simple are you?

Haha @ the girl that messaged again after almost two hours of you ignoring her. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 06:44:41
Yep. Feels good to not be losing my head. I'll watch what happens and when its stable I'll buy more again because I believe in bitcoin. If the network starts to actually suffer I'll change my optimism. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 06:26:26
My bitcoin poverty is now my strength.

Isn't this also a non issue for those on residential solar? 
@_date: 2017-02-22 17:48:00
I've known it since he incorrectly corrected someones grammar on national television. That takes a special kind of moron but we still made him president. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 12:54:28
Isn't that part of it becoming an official exchange? The transactions will be honored from my understanding. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 01:06:52
He's the real bitcoinchamp.
@_date: 2015-01-30 04:05:22
Plus they will design it to allow them to mint new coins. 
@_date: 2016-03-05 21:14:04
Ha. And your business appears to be losing money. Good job. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 22:07:32
Is this a real question? Easy answer. Processing fees. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 19:25:30
Awesome! As I recently made my first whole bitcoin I will tip this forward. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 03:03:40
It sounds like they are randomly taking smiles as payment.

@_date: 2015-01-14 16:29:39
Can you try to be more creative? 
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:24:44
Yeah. Thats tough. I only play bitcoin with beer money levels of investment. I forsake myself beer when I think we're hitting lows and I want to buy more satoshis. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:21:51
This is part of the problem with bitcoin at the moment. I just did the same thing. I bought damn near yesterdays bottom and now I'm feeling pretty good about myself. Even though o hold the long view on bitcoin playing the volatility is too fun and it seems like most bitcoin is held by people who enjoy that volatility just like me. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 19:14:42
I don't really go around encouraging people to 'get into' bitcoin. I do believe that bitcoin has a good likelyhood to grow massively. Do you think I'm ignorant?
@_date: 2015-01-15 22:21:33
This is the  thing that attracted me to bitcoin. I like that I have a chunk of value (however small) that is not subject to the manipulation of the fed. 
@_date: 2017-02-17 05:28:21
Thank God I'm not the only bitcoiner who doesn't give a fuck how many bitcoiner are in Trumps admin. The man's ideology is a disaster waiting to happen and I would give all my bits if it would help end his term. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:51:04
What did you do? Dump a bunch of money into it?
@_date: 2016-01-16 04:46:43
And then one time bitcoin crashed all the way to $360.
@_date: 2017-02-17 14:55:05
I didn't insult you. I asked you a question. And you just confirmed my suspicion. It's sad that you think this is a good thing. This regulation is like something a libertarian 13 year old would think of. This is basically saying if there is a good idea that somehow both sides of Congress agreeon and is beneficial to the US we still can only initiate it if we eliminate two other laws. This is not to say simplifying the regulatory landscape is a bad thing it's is in concept a very good thing. But creating arbitrary barriers to implementing new laws where everybody agrees is plain stupid. You don't go riding a bicycle without breaks simply because it already had too many moving parts. Everybody thinks it should have breaks and you shouldn't have to remove the pedals as a trade off. 
@_date: 2017-02-17 15:50:25
Do you realize just how ironic this comment is? You accuse me of only dealing in insults while only insulting me. At least I actually had a policy argument. 
@_date: 2017-02-22 18:12:17
There is a difference between getting something wrong and insisting another person who is correct is wrong. But go ahead and keep bouncing on Trumps cock. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:13:44
Cool. Keep waiting.
@_date: 2017-03-11 00:34:47
But I was told that Trump installed a Bitcoin loving, regulation hating administration. 
@_date: 2016-01-02 15:51:30
The point is that with a bitcoin system the government can't just bail out the bad actors by enlisting the fed and the treasury. 
@_date: 2016-01-03 15:51:34
Good luck with that. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 01:22:49
Are you a real rapper?
@_date: 2017-02-22 19:07:38
So it was fine when you posted that Obama video? I'm attacking the man and not his policies. And is it not allowed to be vulgar when talking about Trump? That's simply laughable you intellectually dishonest nit.
@_date: 2016-03-05 01:47:47
Ready to sell your coins?

These are the same people who are shocked SHOCKED when their order at Carl's Jr. is off.

Not only that. He tried to bring the whole thing down with him. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 23:15:42
Not an income tax event though. You pay sales tax regardless. 
@_date: 2016-06-08 04:06:32
Also the price has more than doubled previous sustained prices so a halving shouldn't be a deterrent. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 06:36:47
Ha. This reminds me of the Reddit argument I had with a guy denying climate change. He kept on repeating his credentials of being an engineer and a physicist. He had a bachelors degree in those areas. He's sitting here refuting 100's of doctors that work in fields directly involved in climate science and he believed his observations were of equal standing.  
@_date: 2016-06-21 12:12:09
Haha. For a second there you had me going into rage mode. I was thinking "Fuck your leveraged gambles I'm not responsible for your games."
@_date: 2016-06-07 19:42:50
Eh. Neither is right or wrong. He is arguing semantics and being an ass about it. 
@_date: 2018-10-26 07:25:57
These post have been happening for years. They never achieve a damn thing. I can't imagine what goes through the mind of a person who thinks complaining about what people post on reddit will ever change what people choose to post on reddit.

When will people learn that bitching a out what gets upvoted is never going to change what gets upvoted. 
@_date: 2015-08-06 16:13:35
Agreed. I'd also be a lit more app to feel secure recomending bitcoin purchases to non-tech inclined friends if they could purchase a $40 trezor. Right now its hard to say yeah you don't know how to install an OS on your PC but you should totally get into this bitcoin thing where you are responsible for your own security unless you have an extra $120. These are people who I would think would be willing to buy &lt;$100 of bitcoin.

Um, they both have their own tech. There is no reason for them to partner. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 16:23:27
I think if we help friends and family secure and manage their bitcoin its important that we explain to them the importance of securing their bitcoin themselves or by a trusted person. If we don't explain it they are likely to eventually store in a site where their bitcoin may be susceptible to attack.  
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:20:14
Probably not whining like a bitch.
@_date: 2015-08-04 20:28:18
So if bitcoin is so horribly flawed why are you wasting your time with us dumb dumbs? 
@_date: 2015-07-26 23:14:37

@_date: 2015-07-27 01:49:12
Haha. You're a clown if that's what you really think. Microsoft is heavily invested in AR which is possibly a stronger competitor to VR and can easily transition or double as a VR platform. And Google has plenty of VR and AR development happening. If you think Oculus has any substantive advantage in the area of VR you are simply falling for hype.

So very wrong. It sounds like you are really bad at investing. 
@_date: 2015-07-27 02:33:29
Oh wow. You develop for Oculus. That doesn't give you any credibility if you don't know that Google has their own VR development. Oculus may be first to market but that is in no way an indication that their product will be a success or even gain any substantial traction. I haven't even mentioned the fact that Sony is also building their own VR hardware and they have they happen to be the the most dominant force when it comes to gaming hardware. 
@_date: 2017-04-06 04:37:31

Dude we've been covering that stuff for years. YEARS. This sub does cover any major news in regards to major organization and small businesses accepting Bitcoin. The reason you see price post is because that is the only real new thing to talk about. Just a couple months back most of the discussion was about scaling issues and promoting running nodes. In fact this post is actually pretty naive.

As a somewhat long time holder this is great. Not that I've lost thousands of dollars in value but that it reminds me of the earlier dips that scared the crap out of me when I didn't have so much headroom. Staying the course rewarded me then and I'm sure it will continue to because I believe in Bitcoin. I mean come on we are seeing lower fees than ever.

I agree. As a retailer his role is not to recommend to his customers to utilize a new currency. His role is simply to accept currency of his own will. If any retailer tried to tell me what form of currency I should use I would bail with haste. Now if I see that a retailer accepts a currency I will consider the benefits. This is simply over-stepping a role. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 19:29:25
Wow! Awesome. As if I want making enough money by doing nothing today. 
I'm interested in bitcoin for many reasons. I see it as part if our inevitable sci-fi like possibility of the future. I like that it can't be manipulated by a central authority. I like that its secure even from the gov. 
I found this sub through regular reddit browsing.

It goes right along with his need to create such a excessively long list of accomplishments for himself. Then at the end of the day he plays the victim card not acknowledging how he has dragged the names of prominent bitcoiners through the mud.

@_date: 2015-03-10 22:49:20
I guess you guys hate support players. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 01:12:50
It makes them not novel.
@_date: 2015-03-10 22:47:16
I feel like using the blockchain to handle title will have to prove itself in another industry before it can be applied to real estate. Would you agree? I'm actually planning at being at the event in Irvine.
@_date: 2015-11-27 20:28:02
I ordered mine. I've been wanting one for a long time and this was the perfect occasion. I somehow messed up the promo code and paid full price. They even responded quickly with a refund for my goof. Great service.
@_date: 2017-05-11 06:13:20
No I'm blaming the tool and the user. If you want me to take you seriously don't use lol in your response like a child. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 15:05:33
I don't really have any suggestions for you but I just think this is cool that you are promoting adoption. You should tell us about your store. Maybe you could have a cool bitcoin t-shirt that can only be purchased with btc.

Isn't the difficulty system designed to be flexible for these types of problems? Like isn't that the whole point for difficulty to be able to adjust based on the networks need?

I keep telling people to buy just a bit to get your feet wet when they ask me about buying Bitcoin. I tell them to spend what that may spend on a nice dinner then sit on it and see where it goes. Worst it cost you is eating at home one time. But everybody seems to think they need to drop serious cash when they decide they want to get it. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 00:53:54
I think this is pretty positive. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 10:37:47
Has he ever suggested this type of caution with gold? Has he ever said to pull your initial investment in gold out? If not that just exposes him as a gold pumper. 
@_date: 2015-03-05 14:39:57
With bitcoin there is good reason to be skeptical of any software you might use especially ones without a rep. Doesn't mean its a malicious app though. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 22:10:34
Foolish subreddit. They get all excited discussing the topic of the subreddit. 
@_date: 2016-05-02 14:19:26
Sure. Go for it. 
@_date: 2015-02-14 01:37:08
And require a much larger cost to utilize the network. 
@_date: 2016-05-02 14:28:42
Hey. I am offend. 
@_date: 2016-05-03 16:25:47
Yeah. That was a lot of footwork for a boomerang joke. I love Colbert but that was sad. 
@_date: 2015-02-06 17:19:53
B-b-but typing in account numbers is so draining. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:11:31
I still hate GSW.
@_date: 2015-02-11 04:21:45
@_date: 2015-03-05 14:37:54
I believe the second part of your statement is the more true but from my understanding bans have been rolled back. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 04:55:51
OK then. Stick it to Jezebel with your high principles. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:45:43
Ah the good ol days of bitcoin when a crash was losing hundreds of dollars of value in a day. 
@_date: 2015-02-14 04:01:24
I think its likely electricity will rapidly decrease in cost at some point in the future. But I'm more confident that processing power and efficiency in the computing space will continue to advance and meet our need to keep the blockchain running. 
@_date: 2015-02-06 17:04:53
Why is being an early adopter such hard work?
@_date: 2015-02-07 21:51:21
4 of the paragraphs start with the word Bicoiners. And another paragraph starts "Many bitcoiners". I'm guessing its not a great read. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 03:10:48
Its starting. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 02:47:24
Ad block plus newb.
@_date: 2018-12-27 07:39:47
God this is the most limp dicked way to dismiss contrary ideas. Be a fucking man and argue your point instead of throwing out wack memes.
@_date: 2015-02-07 01:07:32
You're the man. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-05-04 15:44:11
Lol why would I. It's a joke of a book. I bet you have. How is that 4 hour week going? 
@_date: 2015-02-08 16:08:40
I'm very bullish on the halving. 
@_date: 2018-12-27 09:22:41
No they aren't. That's a defence he used re: the vice interview to save face because it looked so bad but you can watch the uncut version and he sounds even worse there. Stop drinking the kool-aid and use your brain to critic this man. 
@_date: 2016-05-28 13:03:57
Can somebody tell me what DOA stands for?
@_date: 2018-12-27 07:32:01
No its not. Just because he asserts the idea in a wishy washy way doesn't mean he doesn't assert those ideas. Stop drinking the kool-aid.
@_date: 2018-12-27 07:37:54
Dude. The video you link is him denying the scientific conciseness around climate change. Yes he does so in wishy washy non-committal language but it doesn't change the fact that he is purposely sewing seeds of denial.
@_date: 2016-07-02 18:37:01
Yeah and people didn't know how to use the internet for years either. Things adapt and if you can't see that you're just silly. As long as most of the po0ulation doesn't go around losing their life saving in bitcoin without understanding it first then we are ok. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 02:14:52
The funny part is this whole thing exposes the weaknesses of the traditional financial system. Institutions are always fudging numbers to make things look better. On the blockchain all is known and easily confirmable. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 14:26:40
There will be service set up for people who want protection like this withbitcoin but you will pay for it. I find it incredibly stupid that somebody with 50 btc let themselves be duped by a phishing site. 
@_date: 2018-12-27 15:08:34
Ha. Sure.
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:46:05
You should check out his totally reasonable reply to me. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 04:41:56
You're too good to us.
@_date: 2015-02-02 23:55:09
I'm banking on it. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 02:11:03
And then we strike?
@_date: 2016-07-02 14:08:54
Not really. The cost is also distributed into the price of products. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 14:06:47
And the consumers pay the price in the end. But somehow that point is only relevant when people talk about raising taxes. 
@_date: 2016-07-10 11:07:50
How about you write bitcoin articles then?
@_date: 2015-02-14 03:00:15
Are you scared technological advancement is going to screech to a halt? 
@_date: 2016-07-02 18:11:04
If you spend 5 minutes on any bitcoin forums you're sure to find the advise that you shouldn't depend on online exchanges. Especially with 50 btc. The secure and user friendly services for bitcoin will come. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:26:29
More name calling. You're really doing your cause a disservice. Personally I really don't have a dog in this fight because I have a very low technological understanding of the implications of either seg-wit or block size increase. The ironic part is your animosity here leads me to believe that your opposition may actually be the level headed party here. But you're the deal making expert. 
@_date: 2018-12-27 07:42:01
This NPC meme is the most lazy way to admit that you aren't willing to engage the actual content of an argument. Its sad. Low energy you might say.
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:39:21
It's very unlikely to happen without some type of political motivation. 
@_date: 2016-07-13 23:36:48
Um this isn't an add. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:42:32
They charge nearly 5 to send 50. This comparison is wildly inaccurate. 
@_date: 2016-07-13 12:35:32
Then he went on some kind of public Uber referral campaign of sorts. All after his doomed political venture. Guy is a goof. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 18:23:49
Going all in boys!!!
@_date: 2018-12-27 07:15:30
He uses his psychological advice as a trojan horse to insert his ideology into the minds of his followers. On top of it he won't even commit to the ideas he spreads. He presents them in wishy washy ways so as to avoid being accountable for his own ideas he is spreading. He is very insidious in the way he operates.
@_date: 2016-05-16 15:37:01
Beat me to it. 
@_date: 2018-12-27 07:28:39
Ha, no it's not. They are things he has said or done and mostly tries to weasel out of.
@_date: 2017-06-14 12:44:07
Haha. Ok guy.
@_date: 2017-06-14 03:31:52
Name-calling makes such a solid argument. Great contribution. 
@_date: 2018-12-27 07:45:12
Its definitely the weakest laziest meme you can you in a discussion.
