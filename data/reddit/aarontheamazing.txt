The scammer is a programmer.  He runs a business that takes your millions of tiny outputs and gives you back a fraction of the value you give him.
He now has millions of tiny outputs that he sells to noobs on localbitcoins.com.
He creates raw transactions with a .0001 fee and hopes they go through at the time of the exchange.  Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.
His business is very profitable since bitcoin's price rose dramatically in 2017 causing inputs to fracture considerably into tiny units.  
I can come up with 100,000 different scenarios all of which may not be probable, but plausible.
My point has nothing to do with me not being able to claim coinwallet.eu's dust and everything to do with this is a problem with Bitcoin.
(edit:  and I did claim a fraction of it because I am a programmer)

I had absolutely no problem sending bitcoin during this "stress test".
My full Bitcoin core node never crashed and used maybe 1% cpu and my bandwidth occasionally spiked one time every ten minutes.  I even had a program running alongside my full node, running full speed banging transactions through the node (while(true){sendtoaddress("address",amount,false);}
Im a normal citizen in an EU country with $20 a month internet.
I cant seem to find this bottle neck problem you are describing.
If I put on my software tester cap, I can tell you, during these "stress tests", one bug that I think is quite "severe".
**bug**:  The software that supposedly holds money displayed the wrong balance since none of the balance was spendable. 
**severity**: high

Take a step back and understand that trying to convince the world that mining pools with hundreds of thousands/millions of dollars worth of mining equipment cant afford an "average" internet connection or a 2 tb hard disk is equivalent to you selling snake oil.
Jiaxing, Zhejian, Shanghai, Qingdao, Shandong, Shenzhen, Guangdong all have ISPs that offer extremely fast internet before you say "Ye but the poor chinese dont have internet"

in my opinion, duct taping around the problem is only a temporary solution.  This should be fixed at the protocol level.
@_date: 2015-09-08 17:12:09
I.. Don't..under....

Accusing a forum of being cynical and jaded while expressing the thoughts of a person who is both cynical and jaded.
Yes, I think you are correct.  
@_date: 2015-09-02 10:14:54


Yes i am aware of Bitcoin scaling problems.
I am also aware of how difficult it is to reverse global warming.
Just because it is extremely difficult to reverse doesn't mean we shouldn't try and reduce fossil fuel emissions.
No one wants Blockstream to stop developing Lightning Network or similar products, we just want Bitcoin to not suffocate on its own success.
@_date: 2015-09-11 11:02:39
which has nothing to do with the conversation...
your bitcoin core says you have 1btc.
but you cannot use the 1 btc.
that is the point of the conversation.

@_date: 2015-09-11 10:19:53
I know and I did this.
My point is more high level.
My mom cant do this.
Therefor the value of 1 btc (many inputs) != 1btc
@_date: 2015-09-02 08:37:28
So mining pools can afford it but now the average person cant afford to run a full node.
We have had anywhere from 3-10,000 full nodes with 1 mb blocks.
Your trying to convince the Bitcoin crowd that, in the entire f** world there arent 3-10,000 people with "average" internet connections that will run a full node?
Snake oil.
@_date: 2015-09-11 10:21:16
Yes, fungibility to me is more important than blocksize.
@_date: 2015-09-10 13:24:31
I think bitcoin needs about a million dollars a day investment to not drop in price
@_date: 2015-09-11 10:32:47


This is what needs to be looked at.  Somehow we need to create a system that incentivizes miners to collect as many transactions as possible with rewards, while still allowing for miniscule fees for a transaction regardless of number of inputs.

@_date: 2015-09-11 10:03:14
No, they are not unspendable, but I am a programmer; so I spent some.
My point is, not all BTC are created equal.
Being a programmer shouldn't be a prerequisite to spending certain "types" of Bitcoin (Bitcoin with many inputs)
edit:  just the fact I had to use "types of Bitcoin"..  
@_date: 2015-09-11 11:05:13
1 dollar bill is worth any other dollar bill.
what you are implying is that dividing up Bitcoin is akin to destroying a Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is digital.
@_date: 2015-09-11 10:06:04
thank you. just..  thank you.
@_date: 2015-09-11 09:51:21


@_date: 2015-09-11 09:42:40
trying describe the problem using physical analogies is not relevant.  This is digital money.
The problem would only be artificial if it never happened.
@_date: 2015-09-11 09:44:15
I am not asking to change the way Bitcoin is created or "moves"
I am saying these layers should be abstracted away from usage
@_date: 2015-09-02 09:33:48


I think what they are basing their predictions on is history.
look it up.
@_date: 2015-09-11 08:27:25
Again, this is fungibility.
1 BTC with many inputs does not work with all wallets.
1 BTC with less inputs works with all wallets.
That is my point.

Bitcoin has been pretty boring lately.
So, in need for something to occupy us, we are all trolling a technical improvement to Bitcoin that we have no business talking about since none of us understand Bitcoin code
Good way to pass the time waiting for the next bull run on the Bitcoin price.

@_date: 2015-09-11 11:23:24
Ok, so in person exchanges.
@_date: 2015-09-11 09:14:03
Yes but my mom isn't a programmer and the guy from localbitcoins is a scammer
@_date: 2015-09-01 18:51:50
this is the thought experiment put forth by people with tiny blocks.
big blockers chuckle at this
@_date: 2015-09-11 08:57:36
And you wouldn't be too happy after you met the guy at Starbucks to buy a BTC via ~~LocalBitcoins~~ in person exchange, all seemed to confirm and go ok (he sent with .0001 fee and it got processed), and you get home to buy an xbox at overstock and the BTC "didn't work".
@_date: 2015-09-11 10:37:07
a programmer can send a ~~billion~~ a lot of inputs in one transaction with tiny fee.  It might never be processed or it might.
@_date: 2015-09-11 09:16:11


lets say its localbitcoins.  who knows.  and you cant assume that everyone using bitcoin is technically competent.
in physical money, you can see someone is giving you pennies.
not in bitcoin unless you know what to look out for,.
@_date: 2015-09-11 10:13:57
which is not relevant to the conversation.
I have 1.14 BTC collected from the coinwallet.eu
I send it to you in one transaction with zero fee.
It goes through.
You have a wallet that says 1.14 BTC.
You want to buy an xbox from overstock.
You get to the screen where it displays qr code.
You scan it. 1.01 btc, fee:2 btc  
insufficient funds.
(you are using core)
transaction too large: error. that's it, nothing you can do.
@_date: 2015-09-11 08:39:19
Your analogy to pennies is a good one.
But we should not look at the physical world's limitations as the litmus test for acceptable behavior with digital money.
There is a software solution to this problem and I think this fix should get more attention than blocksize.
to be clear:  what if you bought 1 btc from ~~coinbase~~ an in person exchange as a normal user (non technical, my mom) and unbeknownst to her/him, it was 100,000,000 satoshi inputs.  this is completely legal to do according to the protocol, but is obviously scammy (if the wallet allowed it to be spent, the fees for sending it would be extremely high).  An exception to the rule is a symptom of a failure in the design.
@_date: 2015-09-10 13:12:07
I don't like your post.

The next time you walk into a gym, find the 6 strongest guys.
The chances of you winning in a fight with all 6 are the chances a small money transmitter has in competing in a financial environment controlled by the 6 largest banks. 
In fact, the 6 guys are at the gym door already, barring your entry.
