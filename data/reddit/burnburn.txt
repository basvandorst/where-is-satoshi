Perhaps you should consider updating your webpage to GET donations to roll in. As it stands, it looks straight out of 2003 and most people won't even give it a second look. That aside, I think it's a decent enough program.
Shoot me a PM if you need web design work done!

Oh man, the amount of people who will get these chips and then realize they wasted a nice chunk of money is going to be tragic.

The troves of money he's made from his shitty gambling service.

This is why you don't use bitinstant for anthing other than depositing into MTGOX. Maybe you should do more reading before plunking down your money. This information is available everywhere.

I'll purchase $1000 through paypal. PM if interested.

No, they bet 82k and won 7k on top of all that they've bet. Learn to read.

You'll receieve the highest ASK or the highest BID, respectively.

I'd say the majority interest of this board is directed at cryptocurrency in general, not just bitcoin. That being said there are surely a good number of people who haven't heard this news yet who will appreciate the knowledge.
Please, bookmark this post, then check it again in 2 weeks and feel like an idiot when LTC are trading at over $5 on Gox.

Ha ha ha so funny!
If you bothered to do 5 minutes of research you'll find that the domain has changed hands several time, and the current owner has nothing to do with the trading of magic cards.

You're probably wrong.
You're basically predicting what the price will be 1-2 hours from now, because thats how long it will take your bitcoins to transfer exchanges.
@_date: 2013-05-03 11:01:40
Price crash = miners stop mining = difficulty stuck at a high point = bitcoin dies
This is one of the biggest inherent flaws of bitcoin and has yet to be addressed. I'm sure I'll get downvoted for pointing it out.

No, idiot. It was a hacked account with email confirm enabled. The hacker couldn't send the funds directly to his account, so he moved it through a low volume exchange.

I now have you tagged as "I don't give a fuck"

Here's what I do with my bitcoins.

Again, check your damn email.

Send it to me, I will help you recover it!
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:24:46
Yes you can just have the POS hook into MTGOX API and use one of their prices (usually the weighted average)

McDonalds serves to mostly minorities and poor white people. The exact opposite of the bitcoin market... Laughable proposition, mate.
@_date: 2013-04-01 13:55:33
That's only if you go over the limit though, right?
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:50:45
Friendship is valueless!
I accept bitcoin and litecoin only.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:48:13
You'll pay $1000. When you go to sell coin, the number you're putting in is the LOWEST amount you're willing to accept. It'll fill existing buy orders until it gets to that number.
@_date: 2013-05-03 01:41:18
Moronic. Who knows when BFL will even ship that thing. ASICs are already flooding the market. Avalon shipping out millions of their chips in 10k lots. You'll never make your money back.
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:14:12
Because robbers are the most intelligent individuals on the planet and know about bitcoin? I'm sure a robber would break into your place, see a private key scribbled on a piece of paper, and put 2 and 2 together and steal your bitcoins. I'd sooner bet on you getting struck by lightning. You're delusional if you think bitcoin is that mainstream yet.
Trying to oversecure your assets will lead you to what happened to this idiot:

Redeem the "MTGOX-USD-" code they sent to your email. Automatic deposit hasn't been working lately for whatever reason.

Know how I know you're a loser? You use such ridiculous words to describe sex. Take my downvote and fuck off.

People are too pussyfooted to get on board, and losing out on big money. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 05:05:49
Your money got stolen, and you're posting on reddit instead of getting in contact with mtgox/bitinstant.
Good call!
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:07:43
You're an idiot. That is all.

So you invest more than you can lose AND you don't make backups?
Someone give this guy a darwin award.
@_date: 2013-04-09 01:16:57
Who the fuck doesn't backup a file worth almost $30,000? What kind of idiot are you?
I sincerely hope you don't get your wallet back.

Because Amazon is a multi-billion dollar company that doesn't need to fuck around with what amounts to a pump and dump scheme.
Do you even think before you post shit like this? Seriously.
@_date: 2013-04-08 02:21:35
Reputable company? Hahaha, they haven't delivered a product in almost a year, and their CEO did jailtime for fraud.
You're an idiot for dropping that much money on something without doing proper research. You won't see your coins, or your ASIC.
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:54:25
So you're holding my funds hostage?
No thanks!
