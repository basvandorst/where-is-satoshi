would you lend me yours?

You're completely right assuming that. Even so, Google has a strict policy and evaluation process (I had my code returned many times, not because it was malicious but poor code I guess).
I'm also planning on uploading it to github, I just need sometime to set everything up.

Glad to find you here! I published the roller coaster guy under  with some minor changes. I think the biggest difference is how I collect data, I'm using php to store the ticker results to text files and then comparing the current to the last one. This way I keep it server side controlled. It's a very simple code, all you need is php and cron job. If you're interested I can share with you. 
Despite the change I'm no developer. I'd never be able to do it from scratch. All I've done is a hobby to me and I don't intend to replace or be rewarded for it. 
Thanks for sharing! Awesome job!

Hey guys! I forked that git and did some customizations, you can check on 
The customizations are basically a frame for each of the following exchanges: Bitstamp, Bitfinex and Coinbase (on the US page), FoxBit, Bitcointoyou and MercadoBitcoin (on the BR page), Okcoin, BTCChina and Huobi (on the CN page). Each frame has its own roller coaster guy. The data is captured on server side, stored and compared every 5 minutes (this is the status). 
I intend to add more exchanges from the current countries and new ones. (suggestions are welcomed). And also to add the new status that the author made recently. 
I hope you enjoy and I expect feedbacks. 
Note: I'm a hodler enthusiastic and this site is just a hobby to me, I'm no developer and I don't intend to be better than the author, I also don't expect to get donations or any kind of reward, I added the donate button just because I did something like this before and some people asked for it. (I confess that I was curious to see how the bitcoin donation worked). 
Also, all compliments should go to the author, I only added what I would like to see on his code.

Which other currencies are growing as fast as Bitcoin?

I need a simple and non-technical answer to where bitcoin comes from? How is a bitcoin (or satoshi) created?
This is the kind of questions people ask and I don't have a simple answer, always getting to technical details may scare people.

I've just released v2.1 which has QuadrigaCX. Note that their API's rate limit is very low, which means that the extension can not send too many requests or it'll stop getting the updates. Currently rate is 5 seconds.

Noob question: is a seed compatible with all wallets? I mean, if I use mycelium can I import my seed on electrum bcc wallet?

Thanks for your message!
I'll definitely consider implement it in the next update.
About the roller coaster guy difference, it might be the time frame check. Mine is comparing every 5 min, I don't know how the github.io version is doing.
