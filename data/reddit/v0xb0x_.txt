The problem is we haven't even hit the public phase yet. Only 1% of people know what crypto is and like 0.01% have invested in it.
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:07:09
The only thing is they can make it illegal which would stop businesses from using it. If no business accepts it, the value of crypto will go way down. I don't think that's going to happen though.
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:36:14
Because there is a lot of value to crypto. It helps businesses and banks be more efficient. These businesses will lobby the goverment to keep crypto legal.

Take the hard drive you have in there. Chances are it's a SATA drive. Take the cable that also connects it to the motherboard. 
Go to a computer that works, open it up, and plug in this hard drive using the same cable, plus a power cable that should be available on the new computer. 
The new computer should be able to see all the contents of the hard drive (if not, there are more steps we can take here). Search that hard drive for a wallet.dat file. Once you find that you can recover, theres thousands of threads on recovering an old wallet from the .dat file.

This enables companies to be more efficient. Sure you don't pay for it, but companies are damn sure making money off email not directly but indirectly.


This is a good point, I would argue that those sites bring value because they bring you entertainment which is worth money (Facebook/Twitter) and the save you time/money (Amazon/Ebay). So the users are profiting from using those applications. That's where the value is and that's where Ethereum can get its value.


I'm not saying it's worth zero because middle men aren't taking a cut. I'd be saying it's worth zero because the users are not profiting from using this technology. The pick and axe is provided, but we still need to find a way to make it profitable for our every day lives before it gets its real valuation.

2^160 key generations.
Supposing you could generate a billion (2^30) per second, you need 2^130 seconds.
Doing this in parallel using a billion machines requires only 2^100 seconds.
Getting a billion of your richest friends to join you gets it down to only 2^70 seconds.
There are about 2^25 seconds per year, so you need 2^45 years.

It's exactly like the internet. The internet is worth nothing if businesses can't make money off of it. It's the same with ethereum. Once companies realize they can make millions off ethereum, then the value will be there.

We're at the first sell off / bear trap phase. Only like 5% of the world has even heard of crypto and probably like 1% has invested in it. Institutional investors started last year and this year and 2019 will bring us to the public awareness phase.

I'm not sure what you mean by legitimate. The technology of bitcoin will always be legitimate. I'm saying legitimate in terms  of the public trusting and accepting bitcoin as a storage of wealth instead of FIAT. Which will absolutely not happen if the price crashes to 1$.

I don't think Steam is a dying platform. I think this move is clearly because Steam is in bed with the Banking Cartels that run this world. They were probably forced to make this move.

I believe you own the majority of the fruits of your labor and knowledge, but not 100% of it. The fact is that you wouldn't have acquired the knowledge or the ability to perform that labor without other peoples tax money. School, roads, along with thousands of other things all played a part in you becoming who you are today. 
To refuse to pay taxes is really like saying FU to everyone who helped you get where you are.

How so? The market for bitcoin is the whole world which includes people who watch FOX
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:02:55
I'm not sure I understand. If the price didn't go down, this means many people are holding and many people are still buying, which means Steam's attempt at FUD was not successful. 
Sure bitcoin can be worth 0 dollars and still be a legit technology. But in  terms of mainstream adoption, I think price absolutely matters and represents where the public stands with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:30:06

No you don't have any right to keep what you earn. You used tax money to be able to go to school and have the opportunity to make money off bitcoin. Do the right thing and help out your fellow countrymen fucking selfish asshole.

either way it's good news, crypto being mentioned all over facebook and messenger would be huge for mainstream adoption.

Which system are you talking about that requires violence? 
Taxes are not equivalent to you taking your neighbor's money. Taxes is equivalent to you and your neighbor splitting the bill of trimming the hedges on the line of the properties so that it comes out cheaper for the both of you. Taxes are essentially splitting the bill of things that need national or state-wide oversight. 
I agree that we might have have the most efficient system and politicians don't always make the right move but my point is taxes are necessary and good for society and the country.

Ok let's say we make all roads privatized. Who's going to decide what roads connect where? What if there is a disagreement among the people who are paying of which roads should connect where? Also do you only allow people who paid for the road to use the road? In that case we have to pay for toll booths on every road? 
If we did this for every sector that taxes covered, it would slow down the economy like crazy no way you could have an efficient infrastructure vs countries who streamline the process.

Learn some logic at least dude comon. If 90% of people believed bitcoin is worth 800k and 10% believed it was worth 0 the price of bitcoin would be 800k *0.9 = 720k. Its far far less than 90%.

I'd like to see a source on that because I've never heard that before in my life.


It's not a "rich" button. It's when a new asset class is created, the early adopters will make a lot of profits in it. Look at the gold rush in USA, that was pretty much a "rich" button too if you look at it that way.
@_date: 2018-08-20 19:21:48
Who lost? I see the GDP per capita of these capitalist countries and it's much higher so the amount of money these countries generate per person is very good, with the right social programs like in the Scandinavian countries, it's quite obvious this is the best system to reduce the total amount of poverty in the country.

That's exactly what I'm saying. The picture shows 20$ from 1920, of course it won't fill out your grocery cart anymore. If you invested in real estate, stocks, t-bonds, metals, you would be able to fill our 10 grocery carts today with that 20$ from 1920. Inflation isn't silently robbing you, keeping your money in Dollars instead of assets is what's robbing you.

Pretty good news:


non-monetary claims are not converted into monetary claims at the time of
commencement of the civil rehabilitation proceedings. Therefore, in the civil 
rehabilitation proceedings in this matter, claims seeking a refund of Bitcoins
(“Bitcoin Claims”) will also not be converted into monetary claims after the
commencement of the civil rehabilitation proceedings.
They plan on giving back in bitcoins rather than the USD value of the bitcoin at the time of bankruptcy.

cryptocurrencies split from Bitcoin (collectively, “Bitcoin, etc.”) in the future.

Ya it depends on your bank. I was able to purchase just through my regular credit card without any issues and it was instant. Your bank might be blocking credit card purchases because there's too many irresponsible people maxing out credit cards into crypto.

@_date: 2018-03-01 21:06:42
You can't seriously believe that all people have the time and the intelligence to do their due diligence on every purchase they make. It would make any purchase so laborious that it would slow the economy to a grinding halt. Remember we have to compete with China and other world superpowers. 
How could you trust these reputation services? They could be bribed to lie to you. What if you have a peanut allergy and you were lied to saying this food has no peanuts and you die? We're supposed to say "too bad, he didn't do his due diligence lol" or "oops it looks like that reputation service was bribed and lied about that one lol".
Also allowing fraud is allowing smart people to prey on dumb people. You cannot have a system like that because dumb can only be screwed with so much before they throw this non agression principle out the window and physically revolt. This system encourages screwing over other humans for personal benefit, I much prefer our current system where were forced to help each other out for the good of humanity, and evidently so does the rest of the world that's why NAP is such a fringe theory.

There is no privacy when it comes to the IRS. The government will always come for it's money and if they deem coinbase as uncooperative with government requests they will come down hard on them. Maybe if your a bank or a multi national conglomerate with armies of lawyers you can fight this but Coinbase is just not that big yet. 
Also maybe coinbase didn't know about robin hood specifically, but they know competitors are about to pop up all over USA, so of course they're not going to go to war with the IRS they are going to lose badly.
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:51:04
I agree, the current system definitely takes advantage of dumb people, especially politicians. We try to make up for that by giving dumb/poor people welfare, access to roads and schools. It's definitely not a perfect system but it keeps most of them in place from revolting and causing another civil war. It comes at a cost (taxes) but I think it's a fair compromise.

Okay let's say we live in a non aggression world, and I sell you a fake painting, you paid me 1 million but it's worth 1 dollar. I have not physically agressed you, so you can't do anything about it? Sending the police after me to get your money back would be aggression. Fraud is okay in your world?
@_date: 2018-03-03 05:21:46
Only takes one lucky shot and it's all over dude. You must be like 13 if you think life is like an action movie. 
Also police are government services so if you cut their jobs, they'll be part of the revolution, also who do you think goes in the army? It's not rich people getting deployed. When their families are on the edge of death because you took away their government services, guess whats going to happen. 
Keep being edgy on the internet it's cool but we both know your theory makes no sense at all.

10 days worth of food is like 100-150$ if you plan it well. Your emergency fund is that low that you gotta pull out of your investments for that? You're an adult you can do whatever you want but I just don't understand the logic here.

Yes when you are selfish and put yourself ahead of the rest of people of this country (ie evading taxes), the state will come at you with aggression because you are robbing the rest of your countrymen. Robbing is not peaceful, so you will have aggression from the government.


Yes if we had 0 governments all over the world then you have a point, because the citizens of those countries are all good people. That is not how the world will ever work. There's a difference between theory and reality, and you are lost in theory. The second America loses it's government, foreign power will be up your ass. Even if we can go back to a time where the was no governments at all, do you really think life was better back then? It wasn't.


Wrong. Military protected us from Hitler. Police protect me in the streets daily. I could go on and on.


Wrong. Did you even read my reply earlier? Without police and law enforcement I would come and rob you of your freedom and prosperity with my gun.


No... taxes are necessary for this. So if you avoid taxes you are refusing to build roads and feed people in need and you will justifiably be met with aggression for your selfishness.

That's true but I'm not sure going into credit debt is wiser than pulling out of investments tbh.

I'm not paid anything, you just clearly don't understand how business works. Contesting requests from the government takes a lot of time/resources/money to fight. Now imagine your the CEO of coinbase, you have the government who's not going to give up, and have WAY deeper pockets than you. You also know that you have to allocate money to customer service and expanding the site or else you'll get killed by competitors. 
Any competent CEO would cut his legal battles with the government and allocate that extra money to expanding the company and customer service. Or else you risk losing on both fronts, legally and competitively.

He was charged and convicted for money laundering, computer hacking, conspiracy to traffic narcotics, by a jury. All the chat logs were on his computer and it was enough to convince a jury to convict him on those charges. He doesn't deserve life in prison though, 5-10 years max in my opinion.

You don't. Inflation/none/deflation would all be fine in the above scenario. The reason inflation helps is because most people in the world do not make more money off investments than debts, so it's in their best interest to have inflation. It helps the middle and lower class.
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:17:56


Oh great so you used some of my tax money, and I'm happy that it helped you get to where you are in life.


I agree with you there but jails are not only for vicimless crimes, rape murder and assault still happens, we have to pay to maintain that.
The reason I defend the status quo is because there actually has been a lot of smart people who have designed the system to be this way, it didn't happen by accident. You think your the first guy that thought taxation is theft? If you think about it for more than 5 minutes you would realize that we need taxation for a country to compete and prosper compared to the rest of the world. Infrastructure is very important and that's what taxes are used for.


This is where we part ways. The state ends up giving you back that 35% in a way that's fair for everyone. How exactly are roads supposed to be built if no one pays taxes? How are we supposed to build schools to educate the general population? How are we supposed to pay welfare so that we can walk the streets without fear of getting mugged, especially since there won't be police with no taxes.


Your idea is actually less humane because you're basically saying fuck the people who need government help to move forward in life. Not everyone can afford private schools, not everyone can afford to build private roads to where ever they want to go. Even if that was possible, it would be nowhere near as efficient as if it was streamlined by the government. America would turn into a shithole really fast because we would be out competed by just about every other country, who streamline these processes so that the people can focus on working instead of focusing on how their going to educate their kids, or how they're going to get somewhere.
Also what about the welfare and the poor people? And police? We're not going to pay them either? You want to live in a world where poor people are forced to commit violent crimes and robbery to get by because there's no more welfare, and rich people are forced to hire private security to follow them everywhere they go, because now there's no more police to protect you?
Your idea is a less humane and less prosperous future for the general population. A country cannot sustain itself if it worked like this. It would turn into anarchy really fast. All so you can keep an extra 35% of your income. It's very selfish.

I would say yes it is unethical. If we encourage small business owners to accept BTC as payment, we should also encourage them to learn about the technology and it's volatility and really assess whether or not it's a good move. Telling people to blindly accept BTC is unethical.

Coinbase is not powerful enough to start trying to contest judges and the IRS. They don't have a choice but to comply or the government could take away their FDIC and pretty much kill them, especially with robin hood on the rise. They are in a tough spot.

There isn't enough room, the images are split over multiple transactions, the user has to put them together to render the image.


We can't, anything on the blockchain is permanently there and irreversible, that's one of the main points of blockchain (someone please correct me if I'm wrong).
This has been known for years though I don't think many people care honestly. There's CP all over the internet yet it doesn't stop anyone from using the internet. Even if a tech can be used for malicious reasons, doesn't mean it's going to stop the rest of the world from using it.

It's not that simple. Debt is good if you have investments that outweigh the debt. For example, you have a debt of 100$ at 3% interest. You could either pay off that debt, or invest the 100$ into something that gives you 4% interest. This will make you profit 1% extra if you invest it and don't pay your debt. At the end of the year, you will have 104$ from the investment and 103$ in debt, you just came out ahead 1 dollar. Apply this to thousands and millions of dollars. Debt is not always bad.

If were talking about the same comment, that's an exchange that blocked it. If your keys are on 3rd party sites then of course it can be blocked by them because you don't technically own those bitcoins since you don't have the private key. If you own the private key then no-one can block you.

I guess you're too lazy to do the math:
The total wealth in the world grew by 6 percent over the past 12 months to $280 trillion
280 trillion / 21 million = 13,333,333.3333$ per bitcoin
current price of bitcoin = 8000
13,333,333.3333 / 8000 = 2625x increase therefore 1$ = $2625 if all the wealth was converted.
@_date: 2018-04-17 18:45:03

Exclamation points!
For real though banks dilute your store of value if you save you money in a saving's account without investing it which is stupid. Put your money in an account that has a higher rate of return than the inflation of 2&amp; which is pretty easy. Banks only dilute your store of value if you let them.
