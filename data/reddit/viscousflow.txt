They are a major stakeholder in the Bitcoin ecosystem, and have earned their influence. It is in Coinbase's best interest that Bitcoin succeed and that means changes to Bitcoin development.
If Coinbase wanted to control everyone's money, why would they get into Bitcoin?

You make a good point. But maybe people could just be wary and critical, not quite haters and bashers :D

Coinbase is simply the go-to place for an average person (myself included) to buy bitcoin. I highly trust them *because* of their larger overhead, for which I am happy to compensate.
You just articulated one reason why I stopped reading this sub regularly, not just with regards to Coinbase. It's like altruism interfering with practicality.

I agree he makes great points and is asking the right questions. Though, he is just using the name of Mt Gox to point out the need for more credible players driving exchanges and trading. From what I hear Gox is not entirely competent, and the Magic The Gathering name brings a lot of questionable connotations with it too. For financial folks, of course ;)

Thx for the link I recently started reading Paul Graham.

Built a technology business and sold it for a few million, and then built another and sold it at the near-top of the market for billions? What is unimpressive about that? He capitalized on the times (even he admits there was luck involved). But if it was so easy why didn't you do it?

Just do the returns in USD and make the policy clear and obvious. Tons of businesses have "policies" that their customers have to abide by. You are accepting bitcoin, THAT is the important policy.

Ohhhh Have to scroll to the bottom to find a comment that even acknowledges this guy might have a good point. It astounds me how many people in this sub believe that since bitcoin's technology is unprecedented, traditional market wisdom can't possibly apply. 
I agree with you. The bitcoin market is peanuts and is routinely manipulated. Someday when the serious traders of the world want to get involved, the rest of us will get taken. You are absolutely correct that those traders won't care if the price goes up or down.

You are not imagining it. In the past few months this sub has completely jumped the shark. Up/Downvoting is dominated by arrogant college kids who dismiss anything remotely negative towards bitcoin. They think they have more vision than people who have built entire CAREERS investing with a firm grip on what is actually happening the real world.
I'm not even a bitcoin skeptic but seeing the droves of followers in this sub calling Buffet naive or Cuban's billions illegitimate has made me take a step back. There is very little objectivity left here.

I know it's completely absurd. Everyone yelling "I told you so!" doesn't seem to remember the price and gloomy outlook 2 weeks ago.

So you're saying that bitcoin's current implementation can handle the same amount of transactions per second as Visa, Mastercard, AmEx combined? No it can't and it is a problem that is actively being addressed by the core devs. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 21:18:20
The limitation is bitcoin's implementation, not data-transfer speeds.

Sure, but the celebration is obnoxious.

Spending your days fixated on defaming an altcoin you yourself proclaim to be a joke. How embarrassing for you. You need to get out of the house.

 Dogecoin did help expand the reach of cryptocurrency in a non threatening way. The bitcoin purists and doge haters are tone deaf and totally miss  the point. 
This Alex Kennedy guy is a complete scumbag.

LOL clearly you, the person who doesn't know how to spell his name, are very familiar with Morgan Spurlock and his reporting integrity.

Hahahahahahahahahahaha oh well worth a shot
