Yeah but you're buying as a speculator, not because you want to use it to buy stuff.

The US would be fine. Its trillions of dollars of debt would be wiped out overnight. And the US could be totally self sufficient. 
Small countries with few natural resources that use greenbacks as their reserve currency ... now they would be fucked.

As BTC's utility grows, the price will drop. Fewer people will hoard bitcoin resulting in greater supply. The market will decide its true value and the bubble will pop. 
Awesome for anyone that wants a viable decentralized currency. Not so great for people looking to cash in once it 'goes to the moon'.

Supply of btc (in circulation) goes up as btc owners have more opportunity to spend. 
Demand at best stays the same (with established more widely accepted currencies available and arguably more attractive as they are less volatile and backed by governments).
Demand for fiat increases as entities accepting btc have to sell it for fiat to pay suppliers and employees with fiat (leading to more downward pressure on btc). 
If btc was adopted worldwide overnight you might have a point. But the reality is that if btc is broadly taken up it will happen gradually and btc will drop in value as speculators accept that the bubble is deflating. 
I'm 100% behind the concept of a decentralized currency. I just believe the market is pricing it way too high. The more people are able to use it as a currency, the more rational the market will be in determining its true value.
