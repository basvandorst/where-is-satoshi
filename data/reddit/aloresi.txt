You get it :)
The economic model that existed on bitcoin before was that miners "competed", and that was the best solution for all, and for the system.
Now, the economic model of "collusion" is the best model for the "gatekeepers".
And because of the routing ... how will it go when a few "central" hubs decide to collude to profit from all the traffic going through them.

Overstock accept bitcoin cash so aren't they an enemy of bitcoin? or is that just 2x? I honestly get confused and I'm not sure anymore..

I don't think you realize that there will be no going back after bit148, there will be no 'rollback', miners 'dropping' blockstream would be burning their own infrastructure to the ground.
You think they'd go mine a coin worth a few cents that they'd have 51%+ rate on, that isn't accepted anywhere..
The main problem here is that you seem to understand what's going on (the coup), but you are not looking at it from all perspectives.
 
You seem to think that miners will just give up the hundreds of millions and more that they've invested and just hand over Bitcoin to Blockstream/Sidechains.
You seem to think Sidechains will actually work without miners.

It means they will just cut themselves off from the network and be in a stagnated chain with 1mb congestion, what miners will mine it? Bitfury? They currently have something like 11.1% of the bitcoin hash rate.
How many miners are signalling for segwit? 20-30%? If only 20% of miners mine on your minority uasf chain then Bitfury suddenly have 55.5% of the hash rate on your new minority congested 1mb coin.
Well done 'decentralization'.
But if you're confident a majority of minors will mine the uasf fork, sure, go ahead, best of luck to you.

Miners lose out, over time they lose out even more as more and more fee's are siphoned by Sidechains and Blockstream.
When the revenue of fee's takes priority over the revenue of reward, the majority of these fee's will be already siphoned off.
Do you think the mining infrastructure will be able to grow/scale alongside mainstream usage if most of the fee revenue is siphoned off? (as reward will eventually be minimal in comparison).
When fees are in the millions (per day), and Sidechains has 'scaled' to allow even more offchain throughput, how much of those fee's will bleed through to miners?
Miners would be starved and limited by Blockstream and Sidechains, well done for stopping the growth of Bitcoin. And this is just 1 problem.

Technical answers, which unfortunately do not answer the economic ones. Making it clearer that people here really do not understand the economics :(
Well, I was curious, and you've answered the economic question I didn't ask, thanks.
If one day you look to answer the 'economic' questions I asked, you might find out why LN fails without proper incentives (and this is just the economic angle).
edit: re 'hubs', the correct term is 'channels'
I had assumed you had read the paper, hence my earlier confusion (and my questions)
@_date: 2017-05-14 23:59:48
Just re-read what I've already posted, there are plenty of question marks to highlight the questions. And if you didn't already see they were economic questions... I'm really a bit speechless
Don't worry about it friend, I can see I am talking apples and you are talking oranges and judging from how you didn't even notice I asked those questions (you just glazed over them?) I know we're not going to get anywhere fruitful.
Clearly you don't have the answers I'm looking for (if they were available in the first place).
I will just leave it at that I think you guys need to understand 'economic incentives' (which you should be able to get in a college or university course, or there's some very good self learning online sites) before trying to build a 'global' finance system. It boggles the mind that you're trying to build that without even thinking about incentives.

This sums up one sides attitude quite well.


Keep telling yourself that, I hope uasf occurs, I'm cheering for it! :)
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:10:21
In your analogy the car drivers (miners) would simply keep on driving while the uasf lemmings suicide off the side the road.
You actually think the miners are going to be replaced by Sidechains?
I like you, you're funny :D

So that users won't have to constantly close and re-open channels locking away funds in multiple hubs, instead they connect to a ln hub who is connected to many.
How much do you think it will be?
Do you think users would prefer to connect to many different hubs over a set period of time? 
The easiest comparison is bank accounts (funds 'locked' away for use to transfer to others) - do you have dozens of bank accounts?
Do you know how many bank accounts a 'normal' person has?
Have you thought about how much a 'normal' person spends per month? Their liquidity? Their capital flow? 
I'm wondering if you've thought about the economic angle here ...
Edit: Of course its locked away, I'm guessing you know how LN works so that seems a very odd thing for you to say. For anyone else - the funds are 'locked' allowing you to spend up to the amount. You don't have to spend the full amount and can close the channel earlier than spending the full amount. And you can only spend the funds locked into that hub through that hub, you can't suddenly try to use the funds for an onchain transaction, nor can you try to use the funds for a different LN hub that you are not connected to. 
Hence **locked**. 


On this I agree with you.
You don't even know whether users would use multiple hubs or a single hub and what the liquidity and capital flow of the 'normal' user is. This is obviously concerning to anyone outside looking in.
If you start to (really) look at the answers to the questions I've given you, you will either design incentives better or realise where there are some glaring mistakes. And by looking at the answers I don't mean just look on this subreddit. Look outside, either read some research papers, or journals, or talk to experts (that can give you a proper outside perspective view).
I don't bring up these points to argue, just to bring to attention (which may or may not be solved) what seems to be some glaring omissions in the foundations of LN.

"Liquid is a private blockchain. This means that, similar to other private blockchains being built today, there is some control over who can send transactions. This sets it apart from open systems, such as bitcoin or ethereum, that any user can join."


Good luck fighting with Blockstream and their employed devs in getting a competitor Sidechain on the Blockchain ;D
Oh, let's not even talk about the patents that can be used to stop another deployment of Sidechains (but they will be used 'defensively', hahaha, good luck with that)

By centralization of all usage through 1 central company that will require users to use a "permission" required sidechain - Blockstream.
Clearly not 3rd party trust and obviously so 'decentralized' ;)


More power to you if you wish to go back to GPU mining, I can only cheer you on :)

all the heavy coin holders are on the bigger blocks side :(
wonder what that means :(

What 'normal' people have hundreds to thousands of $ to lock away from months or longer at a time?
@_date: 2017-05-15 12:03:15
How can you not even see the ?
Seriously, is this some kind of junior school joke? 
But ok, let's assume that for some particular reason you are unable to differentiate a question market from anything else around it, I will display the questions in order;
- What 'normal' people have hundreds to thousands of $ to lock away from months or longer at a time?
- How much do you think it will be?
- Do you think users would prefer to connect to many different hubs over a set period of time?
- Do you know how many bank accounts a 'normal' person has?
- Have you thought about how much a 'normal' person spends per month? 
- Their liquidity? 
- Their capital flow?
I really don't understand how you managed to miss every single question, unless you did so on purpose because you are avoiding answering because you simply don't know. Look, in the real world people can smell this kind of bullshittery a long way away, I'm not going to bother checking your replies because I already know you don't have suitable answers (if any answers at all). I'm just highlighting the questions for anyone else to think about the problem.
And its not just "you don't understand economics", you didn't even notice the questions, which just makes me go "Wow, are you for real?"
Anyway, I tried to help, if you figure out the answers to the questions you'll get a step closer to understanding why LN will never happen (I also suggest reading the LN white paper, or again if you already have).




Hubs are obviously channels (the used terminology is 'hubs', but apparently you don't know that).
Read the LN white paper, it will explain to you about what the counterparty risk is (if you really understood it), there **is** a counterparty risk, you just think the concept only references theft, it doesn't.
