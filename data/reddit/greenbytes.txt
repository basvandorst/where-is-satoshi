Well, to be true the radical libertarianism around this bitcoin subreddit has done no good to its success.

There are very serious arguments against fusion.
* Current fusion designs require a deuterium-tritium reaction, as a deuterium-deuterium reaction is just unfeasible because if low reaction efficiency at realistic plasma temperatures.
* While deuterium can indeed be generated by isotope separation from seawater, tritium cannot because it does not occur in nature; it's instable and only has a half-life of 12.3 years. That means it needs to be generated by nuclear reactions.
* The only way to generate tritium is do irradiate heavy water (dideuteriumoxide) in fission reactors. In this way, nuclear fusion is inseparably linked to fission technology and all the dangers and corruption around it (you might be aware that the Fukoshima reactors are a design by General Electric)
* Furthermore, generating enough tritium to get only one fusion reactor going would require *a lot* of tritium. It is absolutely not sure whether there is enough uranium left at all to generate all that tritium.
* Further, there is the idea that fusion reactors should generate their own tritium fuel by irradiating lithium with neutrons from the fusion reaction. This is very difficult, as in the deuterium-tritium reaction there is **no** neutron surplus, this means every neutron needs to be used that way or the reproduction rate will be below one, leading to a die-out of fuel. To put this whole situation into a picture, it is like you need to survive the winter in Alaska in a hut in the forests. And all you have is a stove and big pile of wood, and a can of gasoline to light it first (the uranium). However your pile of wood is very wet and you would need the stove to dry it first. And the stove has low efficiency at drying. So it is very unlikely that you can maintain the reaction.
* Additionally, there have been breeding schemes suggested, which generate additional neutrons, using elements such as boron and additional nuclear chemistry. In effect, this gives a complex breeder reaction. The thing is that breeder reactions have not been successful in any place than Japan's Monju reactor and they are highly complex and  even dangerous - see the [Monju Sodium Fire]( 
* Additionally, the most advanced designs for nuclear fusion reactors are of the ITER type which would require a huge breeding blanket. However, after many decades of research there are no materials known which would withstand the extreme forces, magnetic fields, high temperatures and extreme neutron flux in such a blanket. In fact, the technology necessary for the blanket is not even investigated in the ITER experiment - ITER is purely about plasma physics, not about breeding tritium or energy generation. In other words, the scientists which design ITER avoid the most critical questions.
* Additionally, you might have seen pretty photos with mean in white laboratory coats running around in a fusion reactor vessel. These photos imply that fusion has no radiation problem, but this is a lie. In fact, once a reaction with tritium was run in such a reactor, it has to go through a expensive and lengthy decontamination phase before anybody can enter the reactor vessel again.  In fact, the decontamination is so laborious that experiments like ITER avoid using tritium in the first years altogether.
* Additionally, key nuclear properties for fusion-breeder reactions like cross-section coefficients are not even known with sufficient certainty and precision to even compute how things would work. 
Some source on that:
So much about "you can filter the fuel for fusion from seawater". 
It is not impossible that all these preblems will be solved in some distant future, but at the present time, energy generation from fusion is little more than a scam.

The thing is that POW (proof-of-work) turns out to be an engine for adaption and spread of solar power as it is now cheaper to mine bitcoin using solar and wind energy. Source to that:
This is good because bitcoin allows investors into solar power to monetize the energy they generate. And the latter is important because - similar to nuclear power - most of the investment comes long before enough energy returning the value can be harvested, which makes it difficult to prepare for the coming scarcity of fossil fuels. With  Bitcoin, such investments can be paid much sooner.  To some extend, bitcoin is energy investment paid by its seignorage.
Bitcoin also helps to work temporarily around the issue that it is much cheaper to generate electricity from solar power than to store it, because you can convert electricity to  bitcoins and store these.
All in all bitcoin will become a huge boost to renewable power once ASIC hardware is cheap enough that electricity costs are dominant again - and the latter is already happening. Bitcoin will simply boost innovation and investments in cheap power generation and the sources will be increasingly renewables, simply because renewables are cheaper.
There's another neat aspect with proof-of-work: Generating bitcoin requires a certain amount of physical work in terms of electricity. In this way, the value of bitcoin is coupled to the value of energy - if energy prices go up, bitcoin's value will grow, too, while the dollar will crumble.
However, bitcoin units **are not equivalent** to a certain fixed amount of energy. This is because the price of bitcoin (and the energy expended to create new ones) depends on the *current* market price, which is growing. It is more correct to say that bitcoins **symbolize** energy, because the energy required to create them is is measured by the current difficulty of creation. For example, Satoshi's first coins today have the same value, and thus represent the same amount of energy, as newly generated coins. But **Satoshi's coins (and nearly all bitcoins generated before) required a vastly lower expense of energy to create them**. By this way, Bitcoins symbolize energy (which is a good approach for a more sustainable kind of money), but in an efficient way.
To put the extend of this into some perspective, look at this logarithmic plot of bitcoins price evolution over time:
You see that until about January 2013, the bitcoin price was mostly below 10 dollars. Consequently, before that time, it was never economical to expend more electrical energy than with a cost of 10 USD to generate one bitcoin. And more than half of all bitcoins were generated before that time. That means that today, a bitcoin with a price of around 400 USD was generated using energy of less than 10 USD, and with some probability even  less than 0.1 USD.
