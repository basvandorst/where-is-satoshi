In the past there have been, seemingly innocent, browser extensions that will alter crypto addresses in one's clipboard when the user copies and pastes addresses from one place to another, pasting a different address into the destination than was originally copied. Apart from being able to give you absolute advice, I recommend an audit of your browsers' extensions. And yes, if you can not locate the private keys, or are the victim of such a malicious extension you are S.O.L. Welcome to bitcoin. Small mistakes can wind up costing quite a lot, it's one reason, I fear, that hinders mass adoption. HTH

It doesn't have to be all or nothing for one camp and not the other. Personally, I invest in a typical asset allocation based on my risk tolerance and my time horizon, which definitely includes American stocks. Additionally I dedicate about 20% of my portfolio to what I call "alternatives". This 20% is divided among riskier assets, like crowd funded real estate, crypto currencies, and p2p lending, among others. Hope this helps.

I agree with you, the tx fees are out of control, and have been for some time. I donated $10 worth of BTC to Wikipedia, and paid over $11 worth of BTC in fees. I, personally, refrain from transaction under $1-2k worth of BTC, nowadays, to keep my fees under 5%.

It seems as though you are equating the labeling of a bubble as predicting BTC's demise. After a bubble bursts, an asset is still capable of appreciating, but that doesn't mean the bubble never occurred. In this case, I see both of them as, fairly clearly, bubbles that popped. You're basically saying, because BTC still exists and is not $0 a bubble could never have existed, which couldn't be further from the truth. In 2013 the bubble burst and took 3 years for the price to recover. Fast forward to 2017, we're experiencing similar speculation/hype inflated bubble bursting. Do we predict the end of BTC when we label a pattern a bubble, not at all! Bitcoin is here to stay, for the near term. You can relax!
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:32:28
BTC has experienced issues scaling for over a year now. As its popularity increases, so, too, do the number of transactions. There is a backlog of transactions waiting to be confirmed. To get your transaction confirmed first, you have to pay a higher fee. Your wallet has calculated, dynamically, the fee that it thinks is likely to get your transaction confirmed in a timely manner, and, most likely, is outrageous when compared to the amount of BTC you were trying to transact. Personally, I would not recommend transacting less than $1-2k worth of BTC at a time. Hope this helps. Let me know if you have any follow up questions.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:12:16
Well yeah it's impossible to predict the exact top and bottom, but some trend following strategies can give you a good indicator of market direction. This will at least allow you to apply some metrics to your entry, and exit positions, as opposed to simply guessing and hoping.

Welcome to Bitcoin. Basically there is a finite number of transactions that can be confirmed every second. For over a year, now, there have more transactions than are able to be confirmed, due to Bitcoin's rise in popularity. Those who want their transactions confirmed in a timely manner, bribe miners to confirm their transactions through a higher mining fee. This has obviously lead to some issues utilizing BTC as a currency, and, at least for me, has evolved into more of a store of value. I avoid transactions smaller than $1-2k worth to keep my fees under 5% of the total transaction. If you want your transaction to confirm quicker you need to include a larger fee, which sometimes does not make sense, when considering the total amount you are trying to transact. It sounds like, however, you are utilizing services that may be choosing your fee for you. I am not familiar with these services and can offer no insight.  Hope this helps. Let me know if you have any follow-up questions.
Edit: To answer your question directly, if the fee was too low, it could take days/months/never to confirm. If the fee was appropriate maybe 20 minutes.

Do a quick search for "Bitcoin Change Addresses" and you might come across an analogy...
"Lets say you pay someone a $20 bill for $15 dollars worth of goods/services... you will receive $5 change."
Basically you paid 0.57386453 btc for 0.5279793 worth of goods/services, paid a small transaction fee of 0.000261 and received 0.04562423 change at a newly created "change address" in Electrum.  Scroll down to the Seeds and Change Addresses" section of this document...  Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

Satoshi/byte is worthless for me as well. So I created a small console app that consumes this api:  and converts the value to BTC per Kb. Check out the following pastebin:  The meat is on line 39:
return satoshisPerByte * 1000 / 100000000; This produces a value that, for me, is beneficial to copy and paste into electrum's settings.
However, to copy and paste into a transaction you'd want to adjust this a little bit, as a transaction is, typically, roughly 256 bytes, and can vary greatly depending on inputs/outpus.  Hope this helps!

Yes, the over-inflated ATH has experienced a strong/quick correction. I won't label it the 'B' word in observance of certain people's sensitivities. No, it's not the end of BTC, just the end of the most recent upside. BTC will continue to exist as long as there's a darkweb and the hashing algorithm is unable to be reversed. Do one way functions exist?

Trend following strategies suggest a downside trend. Refer to 
Trend followers buy at the beginning of the upside (October), and sell at the beginning of the downside (a month ago). Not everyone is selling because of weak hands. Trend followers are selling because of smart brains (decisions based on metrics vs guessing and hoping).

I find it interesting that some redditors must spend large amounts of time arguing with one another over trivial matters instead of pursuing more productive activities. "It's a bubble".

Dude, or dudette, who cares what price predictions a bunch of teenagers/strangers believes are accurate? I recommend practicing the guitar, or learning a second language, instead of arguing about price action on reddit.

You're citation is using log scale, here's a linear chart for comparison.  
Additionally, I'm a little curious why you get so strongly defensive when comparisons to bubbles start popping up? I bought BTC at the ATH of ~$1200 in Nov 2013 (the 3rd "It's a bubble" in your citation), the price dropped to ~$200 and took 3-4 years to recover. I hodled, but I guess my point is...


because it has happened before. It does not define the end/demise of a particular asset, but rather, a simple, hasty price correction.

You are correct. Nothing can predict the future with 100% accuracy. From my experience, however, basing one's entry and exit positions on metrics that give an indication of a trend is a lot less stressful, and more accurate, than "guessing and hoping". In the past, just four months ago, I would have sounded exactly like you, but, nowadays, I, kindly, disagree... all the way to the bank!


I recommend slightly less fantastic goals. Regarding stocks, aim for something realistic, like 20% ROI per year.

Yep, like in 1980 when Gold was ~$700 per oz and took 27 years to recover, after the bubble popped.
I believe this bubble popped, but I don't believe its the end of Bitcoin. I sold at ~$15k in Dec, and am patiently waiting for the next upside. Thanks for fulfilling my sell order. See you at the next upside/bubble!

For other Coinbase customers reading this I would recommend keeping a buffer of at least one random virgin btc address between coinbase and what you actually plan on doing with the BTC.

It's my understanding that this is a myth, and that once a files bytes have been physically overwritten, there is no going back. I'll see if I can locate a reference to the research paper. However, if a file has been deleted (reference removed from the file allocation table) but its bytes have not yet been overwritten, there are tools that can recover these files.

I have never done it, and cannot provide step-by-step instructions, but AFAIK, most wallets allow you to create, and sign, a completely custom transaction, where you manually specify the inputs and outputs in question. Hope this helps!

1. be patient and your tx may eventually confirm
2. something called child pays for parent CPFP
3. something called replace by fee RBF
4. Maybe try creating a custom transaction double spending the specific inputs with a higher fee
