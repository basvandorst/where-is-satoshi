It’s ok, not everything is meant for you.

Neither, just a voice in the community. You can listen or ignore it.

Look, you can feel superior all you want. However it wasn't me who made a claim about simplicity and then proceeded to name a few things that had nothing to do with that claim.
The field for innovation is wide open and bitcoin is def. not too big to fail. "altcoins" is a very bitcoin centric way of looking at this space. There are a lot of user facing problems that have yet to be solved for any crypto to become a widely adopted transactional currency and with the propensity to favour user facing complexity I wouldn't be surprised when down the road BTC will be tomorrow's MySpace.... and BCH will probably have nothing to do with it.
For acquiring new knowledge, simplicity is the difference between what you know and what you don't know. Even the most complex of workflows can feel simple to people but even driving a car was really complex to most drivers at some point. So when you are faced with acquiring new knowledge you evaluate the cost of doing so against the benefits gained. 
Putting down an insurance for keeping a channel open feels like a hack instead of a carefully considered solutions built into the core of the system. So perhaps the system is too "adopted" for anything other than hacks. Who knows.
"To dumb down the answer so you can understand it, using lightning will essentially be the same as using an altcoin."
Dumb answer is dumb.

Don’t really get where you are going but perhaps you can inform me of the right understanding of what Bitcoin is.
Yes you are right I offered no solutions and that’s not my place. I work in software development and every time users just clearly describe a problem they experience instead of asking for a solution we can do good work. 
Sure users often speak with high emotion and sometimes it can get under your skin... and then you suck it up and work with the feedback. Maybe its bullshit, maybe not.

Finally, some thoughtfulness in a reply. Thanks for that. Agree on quite a number of points however not sure Lightning is the best approach. However PoW is out of control (waste), wonder if PoS has been considered.
Just a quick note before going to bed. Ready or not the masses are coming. I suspect the masses wont really show up until addressing is improved.
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:03:16
Yeah, I think there are players with a lot at stake that see Bitcoin as something beyond a protocol or an open souce piece of infrastructure. It’s a big brand now so I get it now why the BCH guys are fighting BTC with brand tactics (calling it Bitcoin core). 
Anyway, for better or worse a lot of players in BTC have touted low fees as being one of the benefits of Bitcoin. That’s the problem with when open source projects get such high visibility and not a single company owns the brand... it becomes impossible to control the message.

"No it actually would not be more simple."
Did you mean to say that it would be more simple?
Your argument is however not related to how complex or simple the solution is (to implement or to use). Your arguments is all about the benefits of the solution. The benefits may be great, but it does not have any bearing on how simple or complex it is to use such a solution.
I'll give you a hint, if there are more steps in how to use something,  it's most likely more complex.
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:22:01
You are kidding me? Is this the "lightning" solution? 
If there is a downfall it is that there seems to be a preference for solutions that push complexity and/or cost on the user.
I recently paid ~15% of a $110 transaction in fees. This is pretty bad for a solution who's a big benefit has been touted as being an alternative to other means which had high fee's attached.
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:24:26
Sounds like it would be simpler to transact with a different coin.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:21:40
Well, I'm not sure what he is claiming so I can't say if he's wrong or right. 
His initial claim was that it would not be simpler to transact with another coin than bitcoin. Conceptually this may be the case however I simply made my claim as a user. As a user I have the choice of a number of coins and can pick any of them to transact in. To do this I can simply use my existing knowledge and don't have to acquire new knowledge to do that (such as learning about channels and pay some fee to keep a channel open or whatever). 
Most likely most of the existing coins would have the same problem if it adopted like bitcoin is... but so what. I think it's pretty inevitable that some 2nd or 3rd gen coin will solve the scaling issues. So if the masses truly want a transactional electronic currency they will most likely flock around that. However I think for us to have a MySpace/Facebook moment with Bitcoin, the new coin will have to solve other issues like addressing since we're basically in the "pre dns" era of this tech.

Firstly I was making an analogy, not a comparison. Secondly the tcp/ip protocol comparison is not apt here. Users don’t directly interact with infrastucture, with TCP/IP, users dont have to issue ACK commands, neither do they have to issue POST requests when taking advantage of HTTP.
My analogy of the Bitcoin network/service with MySpace/Facebook goes so far as to illustrate that once users saw a clear market leader in social networking until that suddenly flipped over to another one. 
I’m beginning to understand why the BCH community refers to BTC as Bitcoin Core. If the protocol is more important that UX then that is probably not that far fetched.

World that it were so simple
@_date: 2018-08-26 19:35:49
How would this claim of Bitcoin’s popularity be backed up? To what would it be compared that illustrates it’s popularity? Are there any stats/metrics for currencies (besides crypto) or  payment networks which illustrate Bitcoin’s popularity in either field? 
Just curious.
@_date: 2018-05-29 23:00:04
Had to check if this was r/buttcoin or not. Not making any arguments here, the post title just felt like something that could have been posted there.
@_date: 2018-05-29 23:08:48
Nope, just making a remark. As I mentioned, not making *any* argument about the validity of the statement.

2FA for everything?  What about my mobile device security?
@_date: 2014-05-28 06:26:57
Your entire comment is a guess based rant. Well everything except the low trading volume.... I would think?
@_date: 2014-08-23 08:22:59
Sure, anything particular you'd like to know?
* I received the following email apparently from Blockchain "Your account will be locked - Your Blockchain account needs to be verified. - We blocked outgoing transactions from the wallet linked to [my email address] and it needs to be verified as a security measure. - Start the verification process here."
* Ignoring what I usually do, such as never follow a link from an email to login to an account, I clicked the link and logged in.
* I immediately realised what I had done and logged into my real Blockchain.info account and changed my password, but it was too late by then and I promptly received and email from Blockchain.info (the real one) where I was notified that I had made a transaction.

I'd appreciate the app name by message.
@_date: 2014-05-24 10:07:20
Good point.
And transparent to who? Something transparent to one person is not to another. 
So people want transparency and accountability, but government should stay away. 
Bitcoin is totally non transparent to people who lack any technical knowledge. Hell, most people don't even know what a browser is.
@_date: 2014-08-23 08:32:19
Yes of course. My point in regards to protecting relates to using cold storage, special passwords for transactions etc.
Having dodged various phising scams and having a comp sci education and knowing better did not help my realize I was being manipulated with the threat of my funds being locked up. It made sense for Blockchain.info to ask about some verification, I reckoned that it was related to the NYC regulations.
Anyways, I could, should and do know better. So I will protect my stuff better to have more safeguards.
@_date: 2014-05-08 19:39:17
What's up? Am I too late?
@_date: 2014-05-09 17:38:33
Awesome show! Great job!
@_date: 2014-08-17 08:54:18
I actually want to hear about these poor practices, specially when it concerns media I visit now and then. So I'm glad that didn't "just stop going to the site"
@_date: 2019-06-13 11:40:06
So glad people won’t be able to bribe with Bitcoin. Amazing stuff!
@_date: 2018-04-02 09:05:18
I think the intuition here is correct. We know wallets, keys and sending money works because we use this everyday (there is no crypto without these features). If you are manage risk with your portfolio you take many different scenarios into consideration. Something may be highly unlikely but nonetheless, if it’s easy for you to manage that risk, like not using timelock, than that’s what you do. 
Simply the minimal risk still outweighs the benefits.

USD is a native currency for products and services. So in a way USD is somewhat stable because there is an expectation of how many USD you’ll have to pay for a hot dog, gallon of milk, car etc. No product or service I know of is currently natively priced in BTC. Excluding 1 BTC for 1 BTC of course.
An expectation of exchange value is a powerful thing for a currency.
