I don't. But I don't want to assume anything.

"Holders", not "Hodlers".  Learn to spell.

Then isn't increasing Block size a desired solution?   I mean the original intention of Bitcoin as a currency is to serve as a medium of exchange for the mass market, isn't it?

You are the only one who knows what's going on.
The rest of the people who simply shouts "He lost money because this morning Bitcoin price went up" seriously have no idea how shorting works.

Dude, "Its" is correct.  It's = It is.  LMAO. Way to rekt yourself. And by the way - Grammar, not grammar.
1.  Rare = bad example.  Apples and Oranges are fruits, but still very different.
2. You said "How the hell do you value assets if not you market price".   I pointed how your statement is wrong.  Future contracts are NOT valued by the market price of the underlying asset - in this case the Bitcoin. There is no basis for discussion if you KEEP changing the premises.
Plus I mentioned he did respond to his margin call. - Anyhow, your statement is wrong.
I was pointing out the facts, it's your own inferiority complex causing you to think I am being condescending.
Now, who's looking like a fool? :-)  Change your nick to ztfool. 
Man.... schools in America really needs some help, whether English or Finance.

Not until you learn to spell

Except he actually did not liquidate. He responded to his margin call. 
Don't poo like @_date: 2017-12-12 01:40:58
"Just don't ever sell all of your bitcoin. Sell 1/3, or 1/2, but not all. They were too hard to come by and too hard to get back."
Except hindsight is always 100/100.
If 3 years later the price crashes down to $100/coin or $1000/coin, maybe due to people losing faith in its holding value (or any other reasons), then you would be glad you cash out all of them today.
The current price level is driven by speculation demand, not the real intrinsic value of Bitcoin.
Don't rely on hindsight.

I probably understand it much better than u do.
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:07:26
That is paper loss.  He loses real money only if he closes position
If bitcoin price goes back down, he makes.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:12:51
"He's going to cost a lot of people a lot of money."
If all that is left in the value of Bitcoin is dependent on people speaking good things about it, then Bitcoin probably has very little value.....

Can you spell "Hold" correctly?
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:16:36
A bankrupt company has 0 chance of getting relisted. 
A company's shares whose price was $20 yesterday can become $18 tomorrow or $22 the day after.
Poor example dude.
And paper loss is a very common market term in financial investment. Perhaps you should spend more time learning the trade before dabbling in any real investment.
Also, you don't value a future contract by the value of its underlying asset. I am not the one who gave its definition. Go grab some finance books from the library on futures and options contracts. Its there kid.

So the value of the current certainty outweighed the uncertain future value of bitcoin.
This goes to show how little faith the community has in the future of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:27:06
Well, then maybe it will go the other way round?   
They are laughing to the bank now that their bcash investment took off while the price of BTC barely moved?
