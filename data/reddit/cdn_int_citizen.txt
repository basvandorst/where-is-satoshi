I agree for the most part but I also cannot deny there is a possibility a private blockchain could work when the banks have so much capital at their disposal. If it can bring down their costs they will do it. Technically it doesn't have to compete with bitcoin if its for only banks.

@_date: 2015-12-24 18:09:09
They could peg their own bank crypto currency to fiat perhaps which would allow them to continue inflating fiat as they do now while saving tons of $ from reduced overhead using a private blockchain (they still have yet to develop a working private blockchain). Where as side chains like ripple can be pegged to bitcoin itself and remain deflationary and out of their control so they cannot print/mine more coins.

It would be a shame not to explore on chain scaling capacity. Hence the first line of the whitepaper referencing p2p transactions. Hard forks are more easily done now than later.

It may look like that but you have no proof.
@_date: 2016-06-26 11:38:32
Actually, Bitcoin does correlate to something we can track. Metcalfe's law states that the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system. Take a look at this post. [Bitcoin Price vs Metcalf Law Value]( This means if we keep the block size low that can potentially keep the price low. Not good.
@_date: 2016-06-26 12:20:42
It is possible but I think it more likely that could be users not making transactions since the number of transactions keeps rising. You execute a transaction when you want or need to. Doesn't have to be peak levels all the time.

Moore's law starts over with new iterations of more advanced technology. This wont happen with human population so technological advancement of storage mediums will outpace the populations requirements.
@_date: 2017-01-12 01:22:47
That would be correct if you used the exact same technology forever and incrementally increased its efficiency over time. But in reality technologies are routinely replaced with new ones usually orders of magnitude better in terms of hardware. They're usually cutting edge technologies, right? What makes you think innovation is slowing down, and not speeding up? If you were an older gentleman I could understand that point of view not having grown up with tech from early childhood.

@_date: 2017-01-13 18:55:11
In a nutshell you mean to say there will be no advancements after a certain point in the far off future for technology innovation. We cant possibly know that for sure now, or in the foreseeable future. Western nations with high standards of living, level off in populations as 2 parents most often have 2 children. While in the developing world its more common to have 5 children per family. Enable those populations to empower themselves with a global currency and you slow down population growth. General technology doesn't play as big of a role in population growth as you might think. Its more about poverty. Trying to engineer something for assumed population hundreds of years from now is not good engineering.

You are very misleading. Satoshi said that increased fees could be used when the mining reward is gone or its too burdensome to run a node. NOT BEFORE actual adoption which would compensate. Also, any spam argument is PURELY POLITICAL because miners can set a minimum fee to avoid dust transactions.

We have far less than 1% adoption right now. Seriously. Also you only cite costs, never profit so you haven't really shown any fact regarding burden. Insult all you want. I am used to r/Bitcoin. EDIT: I might add that the halving doubles the value which compensates for miner profit as well. If real adoption happens, it wont be a mere $900. But right now that can't happen with a 1mb block size. The price of bitcoin strongly correlates to the number of daily transactions squared. If the number of transactions cannot grow, the price will be suppressed, severely.

That line of thinking only works in the short term. Once a  technology reaches its physical limits a new and more efficient technology takes its place and the cycle starts over again until another wall is come upon. So to assume we will be using the same type of storage hardware cannot be correct, which is the basis of your argument. Thats like saying we will be using the same basic storage designs for hardware in 30 years and at the quickening rate of innovation that is highly unlikely. Example: CPUs we have today compared to the soon to come quantum chips. Cassettes =&gt; CDs =&gt; DVDs =&gt; Blueray. Increasing by orders of magnitude at each step.

I have seen it sold as such many times and like to point this out as not all people will understand this. A block size increase can/should be part of the scaling solution but that tiny increase in transaction space SegWit provides should not be considered scaling.

The problem is money is created from debt and its completely unsustainable unless you look forward to some type of terrible dystopian future. Bitcoin is the first with the potential for said incorruptible basis for value. This is the true test of the experiment that is bitcoin. If a private company can build a team around the devs and completely change its purpose, remove 0 conf transaction viability, not allow the network to grow and alter its use case after billions of dollars have been poured into it... that is a corruptible system. But we are not there yet. Results pending. It could be a while before we see what direction Bitcoin takes.

Bitcoin has a 2016 block delay before the difficulty adjusts. This is weeks. Any minority chain will have to double down on costs for two weeks to support that chain and its not economically feasible. Not only that, the second chain would fall behind with less hash power. The longest chain is the only bitcoin blockchain. This is not ethereum with a 1 block difficulty readjustment time.

@_date: 2016-11-24 18:08:43
No matter what the fee is, there is no way a fee will make a transaction size smaller. So when usage increases there is nothing that will get a transaction through immediately if all wallets use the same fee baselines. There is no need for an example to show you that you cant fit 5 litres water into a bucket that only holds 1 litre.

Umm, you mean blockstream. Most miners want bigger blocks. Blockstream wont do it.
@_date: 2016-11-24 17:45:13
Bitcoin has hard forked before and it will happen again. If you take into account the 2 week difficulty adjustment delay (2016 blocks) and its effect on a minority chain, post split, the cost of mining that chain would be much much more which would cause a death spiral because its not economically feasible. If you try to compare this to Ethereum its a bad comparison because the Ethereum difficulty adjustment is every block, like a moving average. So there is no more cost to mining the minority chain for Ethereum. In addition a Bitcoin minority chain post split would quickly fall behind because it lacks the hash power to find blocks every ten minutes. This will take longer with less hash power. The Bitcoin blockchain is ALWAYS the longest chain by definition. The inherent risk of a fork is overblown by people trying to keep positions of power. It is literally an upgrade.
@_date: 2016-11-21 19:39:21
I think you mean vote. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 22:00:37
To be fair I feel there are degrees of scaling and multiple approaches should and will be made, including on chain scaling. So I would think Bitcoin CAN scale on chain to a degree which should be responsibly tested before declaring its impossible with no concrete evidence. This would further increase LN scaling effectiveness by orders of magnitude. This is in line with the creators design and intention. To clarify, LN does not require SegWit to be implemented, but to get all of the features it will need it.
@_date: 2016-11-24 18:24:07
Miners work for themselves offering a service to users. If users are unhappy then miners have to react if they lose money. There will ALWAYS be spam attempts. The difference is the system resilient enough where the user experience/txs arent brought to a halt because of this.

@_date: 2016-11-24 19:08:32
This happens so often, its NORMAL. Yet the mempool is consistently brought to its knees in normal situations.  
@_date: 2016-11-21 17:56:10
There are ways to prevent or make two chains highly unlikely. The 2016 block difficulty readjustment interval will make any minority chain after a split extremely expensive to mine for two weeks which means any attack on it will likely destroy it. Not only that but the lower hash power means the standard 10 minute block times will increase on the minority chain and this chain will fall behind, hence only one chain will be the longest chain. Bitcoins true blockchain will always be the longest chain and thats how it is defined by Satoshi. These are points core supporters ignore which I feel is dishonest.
@_date: 2016-11-23 16:30:54
Also true. Although many people have their bitcoins trapped on these exchanges when the mem pool frequently becomes backlogged. Not a good position to be in when you cant move your funds to a safe location/wallet.
@_date: 2016-12-20 19:49:18
Bitcoin is already a store of value. Why do you think otherwise? An attribute that came AFTER it was a medium of exchange. Medium of exchange comes first and you can find examples in history. You can't have a store of value that no one can exchange. That is just common sense.. Also, no one said the price would grow exponentially. It really sounds like you are implying that new users will not lead to a higher Bitcoin price. Can you explain that in the face of contrary evidence? I mean this is simple. Its supply and demand. John Nash inst helping you prove your point here, i dont know why you event said that. Throwing out a name is meaningless. If you think Bitcoin doesn't have any more capabilities compared to gold then you are stuck in the past. 20 year old literature on gold inst going to help you understand the possibilities for innovations Bitcoin can bring us. The revolution that is the Bitcoin blockchain can do a LOT more than just a store of value. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 20:12:08
[Actually there is evidence to suggest this is correct.]( )
As you can see the price COULD be limited by the block size limit @ 1mb. Bitcoin's primary raison d'être is a peer to peer cash system as it is written in the first line of the whitepaper by Satoshi. I am not sure who you represent when you say it is meant for something else. Meaning if on-chain transaction fees reach $10 US on a consistent basis, bitcoin is not what is described in the whitepaper as a peer to peer cash system.
@_date: 2016-11-30 20:12:06
The cost of mining on the minority chain will be significantly higher until 2016 blocks have been mined on that chain and the speed at which blocks are found will be slower causing it to fall behind and become the shorter (invalid) chain. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 22:04:14
I see where you are coming from. But I would also argue cash doesn't require a hefty transaction fee easily costing more than the value of the transaction. I don't think there will be a ton of zero fee confirmations in the future but getting as close to that as possible is important to be cash-like. Bitcoin is not physical either and I think there is way more room for fee optimization when compared to traditional assets which you described.

Hahaha yea, non-global, fiat, state controlled currencies that are not digital and do not use a blockchain? Explain to me how those are going to solve any problems we have today when they have already existed for so long. They are more likely to cause problems. Why do negative interest rates exist? Why are governments restricting physical cash? Do you live under a rock? How can someone in Estonia send 1USD to Thailand without a third party and a Blockchain? Can they do what Bitcoin does? Hello no! Also, I didn't say the value was 'tied', I said correlates to the number of transactions squared which there is plenty of evidence to support. More users means more transactions. Do you dispute that? Everything you say is just for the sake of arguing.
@_date: 2016-11-24 17:07:18
Where is this phase you speak of documented? Is this in the roadmap? I dont recall hearing about this before. The halving every 4 years compensates mining profits (increased scarcity) though supply and demand. If the new bitcoins in circulation is cut in half, the market value of those bitcoins effectively doubles which increases their value leveling things out for miners and their profits. This is Satoshis design.
@_date: 2016-12-20 16:45:03
Of course there are! But how many are digital, can be used via a flip phone in Africa and be used to pay a merchant in another country? (Global currency) Please name one. And no M-Pesa is not one.

I don't believe people delaying the extensive reorganisation of the bitcoin protocol are hurting bitcoin. Changing most of the code base with SegWit is definitely riskier than a block size bump that the majority of miners already want in the first place.

@_date: 2016-11-24 16:04:10
So if everyone was educated on how to raise the fee for the tx, it wouldn't change a thing. They would just keep out bidding each other until they stop using bitcoin due to the insane cost. Higher fee doesn't jam any more transactions into the block. Sad to see Bitcoin is so fragile 
@_date: 2016-11-24 17:53:20
Its currently constrained removing freedom to make timely and reliable transactions where users don't have a choice if their money is already on chain. End users don't fork, miners do, in response to the overall market conditions which will always be changing and can move either way. In general communities are reactive, not proactive. When there is enough of an impact it will influence change.
@_date: 2016-11-23 18:25:02
Price correlates strongly to number of transactions per day squared. Chicken and the egg situation... nowhere to go until we have more transaction throughput from LN or larger blocks.

@_date: 2016-12-20 19:04:40
Actually, that is false. The square of the number of transactions correlates _very_ strongly with the price of Bitcoin. This is explained by Metcalfs Law. So YES, the number of users has a _huge_ impact of the price and value of the Bitcoin network. [Chart can be found here.] 
As for the intended design of Satoshi, he did not build it to have a transaction throughput lower than demand causing super high fees increasing 1000%+ a year like we are seeing today. He explicitly stated that the fee market _could_ be implemented _if needed_, after there is no more block reward left. What Blockstream and the echo chamber that is r/Bitcoin are now trying to change the narrative and change what Bitcoin is. Adding RBF and always hitting the 1mb block size limit totally breaks 0 conf transactions as well - a feature Satoshi designed. Here is a quote directly from Satoshi on the subject:


-Satoshi Nakamoto, April 2009

Not the ocean, just a bit more making the system usable as designed. What if businesses and users want to use bitcoin but not as a settlement layer which is completely different than what many users got into Bitcoin for. Its like a company pivoting right after an IPO. We arent deciding this now, its decided for us by the majority when the need comes.  Its still not a settlement only network so we are still waiting for a change...
@_date: 2016-11-24 15:52:39
The real problem is just like this analogy. You have 100 seats on a bus. Paying more for a ticket ain't going to get any more people on that bus. SO bitcoin can only work for the number of transactions that can fit in a block. When the majority of people cant get in a block, no matter what (any reasonable adoption), bitcoin will need to upgrade asap or it will die.
@_date: 2016-11-23 21:36:31
Is this an analogy to compare the present state of Bitcoin with Blockstreams control over the protocol design? I care plenty about P2P cash. It could mean friction-less transfer of money and token based security for a multitude of purposes world wide without discriminating against any person or group for any reason. There are billions of unbanked individuals who cannot afford a traditional bank account or do not physically have access to a bank. $10 tx fees means Bitcoin is no better than the current system to them so why would they use it? Honestly, in your proposed scenario I would say the Gov, in its actions, would attract a lot of attention and further increasing the influx of new users. The community would be faced with a decision and may fork, encrypt wallet addresses and transaction data, etc. If those features are not already present of course, which would prevent the scenario you described in the first place.
@_date: 2016-11-21 16:52:30

BU is not completely unlimited block size, there are limiting settings and I am sure you know this. Suggestion to create a new coin to have an unlimited block size is ridiculous.

Bitcoin hard forks have happened in the past and there is still only one chain. It will need to happen again at some point.

Businesses (P2P, M2M) don't care whats interesting they are driven by profit and if the system doesn't allow them to transact to make profit the incentive to use it is gone. Your thought of what silly is also provides the most functionality and benefit to its users and businesses. Preventing people and businesses form using the system as they have in the past is just strong arm central planning.

Seems even riskier in this scenario. I would imagine anything that involves law would also require timely writes to the blockchain, no? 
@_date: 2016-12-20 20:52:15
By the metric of cost per transaction when blocks are not full, Bitcoin could perform so much better eliminating a majority of the cost to transact compared to fiat/visa (=Value). Sorry to burst your bubble. You really are corrupted trumpeting 'Bitcoin is only for banks'. I work for a major bank and that is BS. But I can see how Blockstream funders are trying to make this happen through censorship and changing the protocol to suit their own needs after users put billions into the network.

Who decided that? You? Thanks for making that choice for the users. /s
@_date: 2016-12-30 14:28:32
Some food for thought. Ethereum has a difficulty adjustment time of 1 block. Bitcoin has a difficulty adjustment time of 2016 blocks (multiple weeks) where a minority chain, after a fork, will have a massive increase in mining costs due to the sudden drop in hash power making it highly unlikely there will be two chains medium to long term. Not only that, the minority chain will lag behind finding blocks because of the lower hast power. This will cause the minor chain to be shorter. By definition the Bitcoin blockchain is the longest proof of work chain. What miners will want to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to support a minority chain with an even bigger backlog and slower block times where the transaction capacity / backlogs will be much much worse than it is it today with a single chain and 1mb blocks? How would those miners make a profit? 
@_date: 2016-12-04 17:10:43
They wont make more in fees if all the transactions go off chain...
@_date: 2016-11-24 17:39:27
I dont see how you can associate high fees and barrier to entry to protecting Bitcoins trustless nature, which has not changed since its inception. There is diminished value in a P2P cash system if the transactions don't go through for days, wouldnt you agree? 8x blocksize increase + SegWit = capacity with room to grow for some time without pushing people away because the system is overloaded. The symptom of an overloaded network is excessively high fees brought on by an artificial throughput limit based on no science. Just an arbitrary number, 1mb. If fees rise, of course people are paying them, otherwise they cannot access their funds. Why would anyone abandon their funds willingly even if it costs them a lot more to get it?
@_date: 2016-12-20 18:10:23

It doesnt sound like you even care about improving bitcoins performance and scaling. Simply put there is not guarantee but the performance of bitcoin is declining rapidly. No one said there were guarantees or this is a business. Doesnt mean its any less vulnerable to market forces and if the scaling isnt implemented those forces will eventually influence what happens next. Be it a fork or other.

@_date: 2016-11-24 17:59:36
I disagree and believe there is no free fee market if there is an arbitrary hard limit when there is no alternative. If said off-chain payment channels aren't here, and we don't reliably know when they will arrive, its a moot hypothetical point. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 20:06:19

You have no idea what you are talking about. Its very suspect and I now believe you are just a truth troll/shill or have no understanding of this subject. Another Roger Ver name drop. How did that come up? Why does everyone in this sub use Ver to argue against logic? Just because you don't think anyone else should be allowed to use Bitcoin doesn't mean it shouldn't scale. Its an OPEN SYSTEM and will evolve according to how people use it. Just like networking layers for the internet did in the 90s.

Critical reasons can still arise and will likely happen if the mempool continues to grow without any more throughput. Calling a fork a coup d'etat doesnt mean it cant work.

NO ONE SAID CAUSE. Do you know what correlation means? Arrogant mass of people wanting the keep a system usable vs private company or industry interest? Tough decision. Explain how there is no value using a low transaction cost system (Bitcoin) to replacing a fiat/visa system which charges merchants 3-9% for each transaction and is fraud ridden. Seriously try. If money can be saved using Bitcoin the markets will gravitate to towards it. Why the hell do you think the entire banking industry is trying to use the same technology to reduce costs and save billions. How is saving a ton of money valueless? This is your logic in a nutshell. Or lack there of.
@_date: 2016-11-25 21:20:32
So if keeping the 1mb blocksize is to support decentralization. What happens when the mempool is too large for small nodes, which is the same group that needed the 1mb blocksize to apparently remain part of the network? Is it not just trading one issue for another? How many small nodes can support mempool sizes in the triple digits (MB)? How is this being tracked and understood?

Pivoting and removing the peer-to-peer cash model Satoshi designed makes Bitcoin unusable to those people when a single transaction fee can be worth a months food. There is no reasonable replacement that has enough users or hash rate to support real commerce.

@_date: 2016-09-08 20:40:35
The "waiting 6 hours" chestnut is due to : people not knowing what fee to pay or having faulty wallet software? 
This is only true up to a certain point. Higher fees don't reduce transaction size in a limited block size. If transactions cannot get confirmations, many of Bitcoins use case fails quite frankly. Using LN which doesn't exist isn't a solution. If a transaction doesn't confirm for hours... how can an integrated system use it to write/validate data on the blockchain? It doesn't matter if it doesn't happen "all the time". That just isn't reliable enough for real use cases. If businesses want this functionality they will seek alternate solutions and just waiting years holding out for this to get better wont work for them.

@_date: 2016-09-08 19:41:37
There is also an initial segwit fee discount that you may be accounting for. This is not permanent. This will change once it generates profit for blockstream. 
@_date: 2016-09-08 20:27:42
Fees rise because of transaction backlog which is a deterrent. This is not an user interface issue. To be fair exposure to this problem forces wallet devs to improve on their fee handling software but that in no way increases throughput of transactions. There is a a danger to letting this go too far. 
@_date: 2016-09-08 17:04:50
And no one has issues with this timeline? I think this is insanely risky and could cause bitcoin to lose the network effect giving dominance to another altcoin.

@_date: 2016-09-08 18:01:32
Realistic for developers but not a market which wants to be able to pay someone and not wait 6 hours for a confirmation. This is why the market share of bitcoin is dropping and will continue to drop removing the network effect advantage. 
@_date: 2016-09-08 18:32:43
To be fair when bitcoin transactions grow at an increasing rate I don't think any business can support bitcoin if they cant transact on the blockchain without the risk of 0 confirmations in many hours. No business would want to take that risk. Core is being selective of who they would like to have benefit from using the protocol instead of all users. People aren't just going to wait two years to be able to do what they want when there are other options to bitcoin. Nimble Wimble sounds very interesting. I am sure there will be many other developments as well.
@_date: 2016-09-08 18:55:26
Business do this now. ABRA is an example. There are business that are hugely impacted already by the slow confirmation times and other that are not. It depends how they use the blockchain. You have to admit the current situation is a deterrent if nothing else for business adoption. I have gone to make transactions myself and seen the wait times and decided best to not do anything at all. My own use as a occasional user has been impacted negatively let alone any NEW users trying to learn. MimbleWimble looks very promising but would only work as an altcoin most likely. It would remove scripting ability from bitcoin if it was integrated which would be an issue for smart contracts.

Which is absolutely fine in an open trust-less system! You cannot discriminate on who's transaction goes through or your just another bank!

severely limits the transaction capacity of blocks. blocks were 1-2kb when the limit was 32mb!

True, I just very much dislike cops creating these situations. What purpose does it serve in the eyes of your average citizen besides arresting someone with no ill intentions. 
@_date: 2016-10-17 16:26:12
Bitcoin is an experiment that cannot be completed in Satoshi's vision because it was never allowed to grow past the early states of 1mb blocksize that was meant as a temporary spam fix. This was back when the the average block size was 1-2kb total...
@_date: 2016-10-14 13:04:30
No, because you would have completely centralized control of the protocol and a company or group can hijack, modify it, etc

Exactly, the whole trend of technology is make things easier for the users which greatly increases likelihood of broader adoption. Yet blockstream thinks making it more complicated is the best option instead of letting people use it now.

@_date: 2016-10-26 20:14:03
Explain to me how to fit double the transactions into a full 1mb block by using "good wallets" and what happens to the ones that dont make it. Hey, why don't we just REDUCE the max block size to 100kb, because it will help decentralization of nodes. User experience or usability in general wont suffer at all! /s
@_date: 2016-10-26 17:06:16
Even if what you say is true that this is spam, those transactions get fees too and are miners profit...
@_date: 2017-05-19 22:20:51
Because people who control the main protocol code will do anything to keep that control. its a human trait to work harder to keep, then to initially gain.
@_date: 2016-10-28 19:50:19
Yes, because the amount of transactions will never increase higher than the point at which you sent your transaction /s

Ok, maybe at first because the insane potential for the value of bitcoin and make select people THAT rich to start some sort of war... but not continuously. It would be their own money, not the social state paying so why would they do it? What for and what would the incentive be for a small group to fund a war? That is what the power of devaluing a currency does. Its the hidden tax you cant argue against or vote against. Not when what you already have is devalued continuously.

@_date: 2016-10-17 20:29:44
Guessing when an influx happens, the reason for such influx isn't something we should be focusing on. Rather preparing for it. Guessing would be like predicting financial markets.... useless. Price increase (which comes with tx increase, look at metcalfs law posts) would suffocate the network right now and none one would be able to get BTC out of their exchange. Also useless. You can't just keep guessing numbers (1mb blocks, 1 million txs) and expect it to be optimal... there is no basis for that. 
@_date: 2015-10-11 19:32:13

@_date: 2016-10-17 18:43:18
What if the mempool is always full from the next large influx of users? If you have double the people wanting to use bitcoin compared to its capacity... but it can only handle half of those transactions, its not growing then is it? You could also try to twist things and say since the congestion is too high in a situation like that it changes users perception where they no longer "want" to use it due to fees or super long wait times cause by full blocks. If you disincentivize using the network, less people will want to use it, which seems to be the the way a lot of people think in this sub.

You may have been following since its creation but you still don't get it. Do you see people talking about how they use TCP/IP all the time? No, because its also a protocol with other layers built on top of it. This is happening for Bitcoin but it takes time. Stop looking at the price.

Who said never? You seriously think an artificial cap on throughput of the Bitcoin network is considered a free market?! LOL!

That's true. But I also like having tax free gains for things such as purchasing large ticket items. The only thing I can buy right now are ETFs.

@_date: 2016-07-06 13:39:28
Well, its ready to be tested then, isn't it? Do you think it should never be attempted because its unproven? There is no good reason not to test it unless Blockstream isn't telling us their true agenda. If adoption increases so does decentralization. That can't happen unless transaction throughput increases.
@_date: 2016-07-26 18:24:45
Private interest. Take away the scalability of bitcoin via limiting blocksize and you take away the ability to help the unbanked who do not live in the west. Why? Because absurd fees and its not longer useful. Dirty trick by AXA who funds Blockstream. Conflict of interest much?

Be patient. You just bought in. Bitcoin wont disappear and if there is another bubble it could also come back to the price where you just bought in. You have a better chance at investing and holding for a while than trying to play the market. Two scenarios I personally picture are (1) it drops more in price. That's Ok... it has enough press to gain strength again and continue attracting users which will push the price upward. It is deflationary. It is just a matter of time. (2) There is an upswing in value and it continues to stabilize and eventually rise sooner than later. But again that's just how I see things... I still feel the panic when I look at it drop like that. But then I think would this matter to someone in the third world who wants to use this currency? Its not dead. This is media bubble  and if we get more bubbles we get more users.
