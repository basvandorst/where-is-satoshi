There's a web version [here]( I'd love to do a full PC release, though it might need a bit more gameplay/content to justify it.

It's available for [$1 on the Xbox360 Indie Games marketplace]( Unfortunately they don't accept Bitcoin, but if you feel slighted then there's also a [free version]( up online.    
    
.    
Build your small town into a bustling metropolis using the power of virtual currency. Starting with only a small hot-dog stall, you must accumulate Bitcoin, breed Alpacas, build Hydroelectric power stations, and wrangle with Red Tape to create a thriving city.    
    
.    
Questions or comments much appreciated!

Yes! It's partly inspired by cookie clicker, but I wanted to do something original - hence the city building/layout component.

Well done :).

The minimum price for the XBLIG marketplace is $1 - Microsoft doesn't let you release for free. There's a donate button/QR code on the free version, but with over 10,000 plays I've made a grand total of 87c in advertising revenue and no donations.    
    
As for the game, it's pretty light. There's one progression path, and it takes about 30-60 minutes to play through.

I know! I'd much rather accept Bitcoin for it.

Much appreciated. [To the moon!](

Oh sorry, my artwork might not be that clear! One's a cake (to represent food), the other's supposed to be a pile of paper (to represent red tape &amp; bureaucracy). I might have to revisit those to make it more obvious.
