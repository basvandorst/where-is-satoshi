I think you missed the point:
The "3rd party's" (payment channel) approach is to replace peer-to-peer by something that causes MUCH LESS burden to the blockchain than a pure peer-to-peer payment system. So if anything, the pure peer-to-peer approach would "overwhelm" Bitcoin TX capacity.
So you cannot accuse it to do something that "overwhelms" the tx capacity. The exact oppisite is true.
And this is the whole point of lightning &amp; co.
So you are critizizing solutions like payment channel and lightning because they create demand for otherwise unfeasible services and application, that then attract so many users that it becomes again a burden for Bitcoin?
I cannot quite follow your point.

yes I did. sorry i didn't know that latest ledgers have a screen and a button on-device like trezor.


this card is what i was referring to as "obfuscation".


no fud! just pointing out a fallacy that the vast majority of people succumb to.


I don't deny they are great, even less do i deny what you think.


has nano s also a button to confirm tx signing? if so the outlined attack vector is not possible in this one and it matches trezor's security.


"hardware key signing, hence 100% secure" : this is the fallacy i was referring to! it is theoretically possible to steal bitcoins with a very highly engineered malware on your computer! how? by replacing the tx that you enter with another tx (send all btc to attacker's address) behind the sceenes while you think (acc. to what is displayed on the screen) you sign "your" tx. the paper card can be backengineered by the malware if you use ledger often enough.
If HW wallet displays output address and amount AND you need to initiate the signing by button-press on the HW wallet, then this attack is impossible.
not saying it is easy to attack (classic) ledger. but saying it is possible if you are paranoid, and certainly not "100%" safe...


...hence this is wrong because trezor doesn't have this attack vector.
that's all I am saying, to make ppl sensitive about this difference.
because I can always read people say "hw wallet, hence 100% safe", which is a huge huge fallacy, that's a fact.

And I think here he must have misunderstood his technical advisors - he himself is no IT specialist I suppose.
(unless I assume he lies intentionally, for which I have no proof and hence do not want to make such a claim)
I assume the technical advisor has explained him the principle of LN/payment channels and that you can do an infinite nb of TX while only doing 2 TX on-chain. While this is true, the advisor forgot to tell Kim that you need separaate channels for separate individuals, so the on-chain limit still poses a limit on the number of participants (even if there is no limit on the number of TX per time per participant).
**By missing this small but important detail,you would then be inclined to say: "Hey, we can do an infinite nb of TX per hour, so we solved the scaling problem."** I assume that is KIM's fallacy (be it intentional or not).
As said, just putting 1+1 together.

**Proof of RANDOM giveaway**: More precisely and accurately, and also simpler, like [THIS](
The random number is a future block hash of predefined block number, the second nonce is the private key of the bfxhacker's private key (so as to not influence the miners), the argument is the applicant's btc address, the metric is the hash of the concatenation of the three above, the winning criterion is that the smallest hash wins.

lol. however you call it based on your personal judgement - "bad feature" , "bad idea" - it certainly does not fit the definition of a "bug"!
OP_RETURN is an official feature of the bitcoin protocol, so it is 100% justifyable to ask which SW can be used to make use of this feature.
However, as a side note, I would use other means than OP_RETURN to register stuff in the blockchain, namely TXs with unspent outputs. Because I am not sure OP_RETURN will stay in the protocal forever if people like you have a say in bcore. Obviously I would bloat the blockchain even more that way, but then it's your own fault.

From what I see, Kim will never be able to scale up to mainstream, at least NOT using Bitcoin, hence **the price rise he promises won't happen**. Why? Simple maths:
Assume Kim wants to introduce payment channels for his service! Assume there are 1 Million users. If each locks in 10 mBTC in a payment channel, that's 10000 BTC or 0.05% of all bitcoins ever in existence, or the mining revenues of 5.5 days - not enough to have significant effect on bitcoin price. And 1 Million is already more than what can be handled in a sustainable healthy manner, as we see in the following:
For these 1 Million potential users it would take 4 days of FULL(!) Bitcoin TX/s capacity alone(!) to open these payment channels, and another 4 days (theoretical minimum!) to close them (the latter will be a big problem similar to a bank run if all want to close their payment channels at the same time because their payment channels are about to expire - some will come too late, "aaand its gone"). In practice, it would take much more than 4 days of course, because blocks are mostly full already now. For example (take other numbers if you like), assuming these payment channel transactions can use 10% of the total Bitcoin capacity and all of today's Bitcoin TX load reduces to 900kB/block, we arrive at 40 days needed until everybody can either open OR close her/his "MEGA" payment channel.
Again, think what happens if MEGA goes bust/gets juristic problems/goes off-service or whatever, and all the 1 Million users hence want to close their payment channels now to get back their current/remaining balance on the payment channel! It would take MUCH more than 4 days (more like 40 days) until all these payment channels can be closed. Clearly, for many this will be too late to meet the payment channel's expiry deadline and hence there will be huge risk that the other side (=Kim&amp;Co.) grabs coins on the channel in a fee bidding contests against the user.
So this concept is flawed by design when applied at this scale.
So I am afraid to conclude that **this solution doesn't scale**. Even less so if businesses other than MEGA want to introduce similar payment channel/lightning based services.
The only solution is to go even more off-chain and centralized, i.e. solutions without end-user's possession of any private key and instead with full counter-party risk (we all know what this means - Bitfinex/Bitgo is the latest [but certainly not last] reminder). Or to use other altcoins with higher tx capacity. So from all this I think Bitcoin price is doomed NOT to rise as Kim says.
If anybody has reasonable PROPER ARGUMENTS (and not just 3-words-small-block-trolling or shouting) where is the error in my reasonings or calculations or vision or what I am missing for the full picture, I would be very interested to hear about it - in a respectful and pragmatic manner of course.
Actually, I would like to be proven wrong, but I just cannot see it, mathematics is against it, from what I see.

Hello achow101, you seems to be much savvier than me on this topic, so I am taking this opportunity and ask you a few questions:
About the "interpretation 1" (OP_RETURN etc.): I do not quite understand what could be the purpose of Kim registering all file hashes in the blockchain in the first place?
About the "interpretation 2" (payment channels): I am now realizing it is too long ago that I have last read about payment channel tutorials and principles... I still understand the concept (probably more than the avg. bitcoin redditor who just "know" that either "LN solves all scaling problems problems" of "LN is a scam by bitcoin-core") but am unsure about the details. Yes, indeed I was thinking of bidirectional payment channels for the Kim-use-case. Technical **question**: When implementing 15-party-payment channels as you mention, and assuming all SW is perfect in handling this complexity, what would be the consequence (pros and cons)? And how would this all work in the first place? I mean, would there be 14 users and the Megaupload server as nb. 15 for such payment channel? Would every single of the 14 users send his signature to the server who then generates one on-chain TX to open this payment channel for all 14 users? So we save a factor 14 (1 instead of 14 TXs) for opening the payment channel? And for closing, still each of the 14 users could close "their part of the channel" somehow?? Here I must confess my knowledge ends, it is too special and I have not read about it yet. If it works, it seems one could save some space, but I suppose the saving is less than a factor of 14, because the TX size would become significantly larger than for only bidirectional opening TXs, doesn't it? And in any case, why is the whole thing limited to 15?
If you use the most easy language that can still be considered "technically accurate" if you answer this, it would be awesome :-)  [unless this is asking the impossible...]

@_date: 2016-08-07 16:33:32
To have a **provably fair** lottery that cannot be manipulated by neither you nor by a miner, I propose you apply the following algorithm:
Let's denote
* P = An ASCII string containing your private key of "1BfxSuxJqXuizBbTcP238JZY9DT4eqvzJG", in Private Key Hexadecimal Format (64 characters [0-9A-F]) like in bitaddress.org tool (letters are upper-case)
* B = An ASCII string containing the ~~Block Hash~~ *edit: better: the Merkle root* of block 425000, in Hexadecimal Format (64 characters [0-9A-F]) (letters are upper-case)
* A = An ASCII string containing the Bitcoin Address of the respective "applicant" for the reward, as posted here.
Then you calculate for each applicant's address A:
* metric(A) = sha256(ABP),
where A, B, P are ASCII strings as shown above and ABP is a new ASCII string from the concatenations of these three individual ASCII strings.
The winner is that address "A" whose value "metric(A)", expressed as 64-digit hex-decimal number, is the LOWEST!
*EDIT: And finally: What "has to do to satisfy the requirements for a provably fair lottery:*
* The bfxhacker shall "freeze" the state of this reddit thread by copying it to a text of html file and register its sha256 hash in the block chain on a block BEFORE 425000!
* After block 425000 occurs, the bfxhacker calculates the winning address as described above.
* He transfers the 1000 BTC from "1BfxSuxJqXuizBbTcP238JZY9DT4eqvzJG" to the winning address and the change to another address.
* Now that "1BfxSuxJqXuizBbTcP238JZY9DT4eqvzJG" is empty, the bfxhacker publishes the private key of "1BfxSuxJqXuizBbTcP238JZY9DT4eqvzJG" here in this thread (e.g. by editing the OP)!
* The bfxhacker also publishes his backup of this thread (e.g. link to dropbox or alike) and the proof-of-existence-info for this file for everyone to verify that it was present BEFORE the Merkle root of block 425000 was known (so he couldn't have added his own "applicant address" thereafter to move the 1000 BTC reward to himself!).
* Now everybody can easily verify that the process was fair, just by utilising " " (or  and " and this thread here.
Clearly, if the bfxhacker does not do it like this (although he is very savvy, certainly more savvy than myself on Bitcoin), we have to suspect that he pays the 1000 BTC just to himself.
*Edit: Typos and minor editorial changes for clarification*

Strange definition of "deliver" they have...

As always's, there's no black and white.
No coin solved "the problem", but almost all coins have higher capacity than Bitcoin. E.g. if I were Kim, I would prefer Litecoin over Bitcoin, because instead of 0.3 TX/s capacity (=assuming 10% of todays's Bitcoin max. capa, because today blocks are already full ca. 90%) he would get close to 12 TX/s (today Litecoin blocks are almost completely empty), i.e. that's a 40 times higher capacity for his service that Litecoin could offer. While this is still too little to satisfy the 100 Mill. users, maybe the 100Mill. figure is a bit too optimistic, maybe not all of the 100 Mill will immediately use Bitcoin. But this factor of 40 (or even more if Litecoin soon introduces adaptive scaling) could well make a difference for the service to be viable or not.


This is the thing were I would have been honestly interested to get more insights. But I think core won't answer me on this - they are kind of secret and unclear and I don't know why. Perhaps they don't want to rise too high expectation that would have a self-accelerating effect that would increase block size pressure in the ecosystem faster than what is healthy for decentralization. So maybe their tactic is to promote small blocksizes as much as possible, but should really a serious competition arise, maybe they would be willing to compromise. I can just speculate.
Many think they have a hidden agenda because they are so "conservative" and at the same time not very plausible in their arguments on the block size and find censorship ok. But maybe they have good intentions and just don't what to accelerate it too quickly.

it's not about proof. Its about MOST basic common sense. If you have 5 Mill EUR worth of bitcoin, wouldn't you sell at least half of it and diversify into real estate, shares, gold, a nice car, a nice house or flat, and some cash? Or would you kerp your low living standards and hope the 5 Mill to become 50 Mill. until you are old?
Apart from this common sense, there have been concrete reports (evidence if you will) of a student having sold all his early BTC and buying a flat for a few 100000 bucks. So many sell way before reaching the 5 Million...


Or sell 10000 and live a good life, buying house, car, travel the world - might be more fun than moving markets from a 2 room souterrain apartment in a noisy street.

Reply  (back to the topic): I am excited to see businesses making use of Bitcoin in a way that could entail mainstream adoption more than ever and improve Bitcoin's practical utility. I think every true Bitcoiner should be excited to hear about these prospects. And then it is just natural for a pragmatic Bitcoin enthusiast like myself to make some calculations and ask "can it work?" or "what could be possible impediments?".
If the owner of such a business is a hodler himself or not doesn't matter to me. If people who take active actions harvest the fruits of their work that's just fair and they deserve it I think.
I welcome more widespread adoption of Bitcoin, and any step in this direction is good. I am not sure but I sometimes have the impression that some people who once thought the same way are now afraid of more Bitcoin mainstream adoption and want to keep Bitcoin small and more a pure niche investment instrument of no practical value rather than an actual utility. I think that would destroy Bitcoin or at least make it negligible in market cap compared to other altcoins.
I don't think that Bitcoin-core wants to destroy Bitcoin that way, but I think some trolls (no name in particular) push exactly in this way on the forum.
Then I am wondering what these people's vision of Bitcoin is...?
* a digital currency with actual utility increasing over time?
* or a pure investment instrumemt with limited intrinsic value (practical utility) that further decreases over time as more and more altcoins provide increasing practical utility (and these alts also being suitable as investment vehicle on top)?

If I do not trust any Bitcoin SW provider in the world, nor do I trust any friend, I just take the chain of concatenated hashes for which a SW exists that can prove that this chain contains more sha256 work than anything else on earth, and I have thereby found the valid Bitcoin blockchain. Bootstrapping done.

Well, I took this for granted - no question for me it would be a very logical step, and I am surprised why it does not already exist! It means there is a file sharing platform as many others before, still everybody can participate without providing explicit personal identity, as before.
But the new feature is that you can pay for extra stuff (get moved forward in the waiting queue, higher download speed, etc.) or can earn money (if you upload content that is downloaded often), and all this without needing to leave your bank details there.
So it is just a logical step. On top of bandwidth and energy you make use of the new ubiquitous resource called digital money.
And what is more: By using payment channels, you can charge per 100 kByte (for example) increment without going on-chain every 100 kB!!! This means charging is possible in arbitrary fine granular increments without any extra burden on the blockchain whatsoever! A user can download 5000 files in one year, where each file was charged in 100 kByte increments off-chain, and in the end the user needs to carry out only 1 or 2 on-chain transactions per year (or per 2 or per 3 years if he chooses so) to open or close a payment channel for all this. Sounds wonderful! Except, with a closer look, we see that even this is not possible when having 100 Mill. users participating, because Bitcoin total capacity is just short of 8 Million TX per ~~year~~ *month* *(typo)*.
That was the point where I started to think... and wrote the OP.

this wouldn't work in practice. after a few hops, many coins can be coloured. Would ppl then reject all these coins?
no, because the color is dilluted and so pale that practically they would be treated as uncoloured coin.
otherwise, if ppl rejected even remotely colored coins, other people can contaminate foreign wallets by sending colored coins to them rendering them u usable. thus situation is not sustainable.
hence we conclude that color can be washed away by dillution.

I know, but if a bitcoin core dev (not you) would give me this answer and I was his boss and he were developer in my team, I would definitly fire him because he destroyed all trust with me, because he does not answer but avoids my question.
I would ask him: Ok, understood it is "complex", but what are the plans, what is the strategy, what is the status quo, what is the vision?
I would not accept if he just answered with "general wisdom" phrases.
Not against you - you are not a developer - but I am just saying that from somebody deeper involved I would definitely expect more, and if this more is not given, I would have all reason to think that something is fishy and he is hiding something.
But apparently most people are happy with "general wisdom" answers and even repeat them to others. That's why politicians can fool the people so regularly - the people are not critical and do not see that politicians are just hiding something by avoiding questions and giving answers to questions not being asked.

Rootstock still needs some time but has 25 partners already...:

@_date: 2016-08-28 11:40:33


it's necessary to clarify the definition of a word to avoid talking past each other. that's not "semantics".


How do you define "effective". My definition of "effectively banning bitcoin" (or encryption) means to substantially reduce the practical usage and mainstream adoption of it. It does not mean make it completely disappear.
Acc. to that definition, banning bitcoin would be as easy as passing a law that makes it illegal for any business or organization to accept bitcoin or to provide a platform to facilitate exchange of it for another fiat or crypto currency, or to distribute software that supports it.
This would move the whole usage into the realm of the illegal. Of course this would be effective. As effective as e.g. laws that forbid possession of wheapons or forbid certain crimes. E.g. in Germany most people don't possess weapons because it's forbidden, contrary to US. So evidently the law is "effective" even though some people break the law. Same with possession of drugs: It is outlawed in Germany, so use of cannabis even for medical purposes (pain) is outlawed and doctors have to prescribe expensive patented medicals instead, wheteas in countries like Israel where it is not outlawed cannabis is very often prescribed for medical purposes to the benefit of the people. So unfortunately, the ban of Cannabis in Germany is very effective, even though some(!) people still grow it in their homes.
The ban of alcohol (prohibition) in old Chicago (which is often falsely used as counter-"evidence") was also effective because it's practical usage was much restricted (of course it was still consumed illegally sometimes by some, but that's not the same as consuming it in the open in every restaurant, pub, supermarket).
Clearly, banning bitcoin would remove the possibility of mainstream usage, good GUIs, user fraud protection etc. It would still be used in the darknet by very few people (1MB would be fully sufficient then, btw) as illegal niche product.
Similarly, outlawing encryption would avoid companies offering easy-to-use open source standards in wide-spread communication programs (while some would still offer encryption sw in the dark but that is often contaminated by malware and cannot be officially quality-audited and hence is unusable by the mainstream).
I am sorry if I am destroying illusions by telling the truth.

I don't know - as I wrote, that  was my interpretation because of the word "microtransaction" (which sounds to be like a blockchain-related transaction, even if first done offchain, i.e. like in LN/payment channels). If it is not about trustless payment channels, ...
* ...it buys some more time for Bitcoin and reduces this sense of urgency of on-chain upscaling to avoid running danger of "losing the cake to others".
* ...I am wondering how it could be "proper Bitcoin" - I guess in that case it would simply be an online wallet like so many others.
...Or perhaps there is really disruptive technological innovation that allows users to participate and possess a private key and thereby owning bitcoins despite never having had a balance themselves on that key (so as to not need to open any payment channel first...)?
I could not imagine how, but who knows... cryptographics is sometimes close to magic (like blind signatures), but at least it would surprise me if such innovation came from a corner around someone like Kim Dotcom and not someone like bitcoin dev community :-)

The whole debate would be elsewhere if **sidechains** were already deployed. The technology is there, the code is there, I think it is about time to work on this with priority. The success of a sidechain with higher capa can render the whole "bitcoin has too little capacity" talk moot. And bitcoin would hugely benefit from it.
I don't understand why this isn't pursued more urgently. With working sidechains bitcoin would have much more than today's 80% of crypto market cap, and total crypto market cap would also be higher, and there would be less btcfork movements.

No, in case of Bitcoin it was open from day one. Everybody could mine, all early adoptors could (and did) participate from day 1. Satoshi has announced the start of bitcoin well in advance and ohter could (and did) participate.
The only thing that is known for sure is that Satoshi owns the first 50 BTC from the Genesis block, which are unspendable by the protocol!
While it is likely, that satoshi him/her/it/themsel[f|v]e[s] ha[s|ve] has mined many ohter coins in the first phase, we cannot tell for sure. Also other actors could participate from Block 1 onwards.
This is fundamentylly different from Dash, where coins were pre-assinged to the Dash inventors themselves from the start, by definition!

Should I even answer this? What you comment is unrelated and off-topic, because I never said any other altcoin has solved "the scaling problem".
Instead I simply ASKED a question.
If you want to say something, say it in clear words! Do you think there is nothing we can do anyway, so any question is useless? Then you know more than the rest of the world, then you know that repetitive on-chain scaling workshops and academical and research efforts in the field are all in vain. Then you know that all the reported progresses done in the field recently are just lies. In that case you should write a document and educate the world to get the first nobel price in bitcoinomics.

This way user can convey big savings in his pocket in a plausibly deniable manner. if the default hd wallet runs out of funds, user can recharge it conveniently from within the hidden plausibly deniable hd wallet (like he would "recharge" his leather wallet via ATM and bank card in a fiat world - just more resistant against a "$5-wrench" attack).

I don't know if others did this, but if you are referring to my post you completely misunderstood! I am not asking for any miracles at all! I am asking for their plan and there opinion, that's all!
I have heared of many technical advances for on-chain scaling methods, as well as bitcoin-core's willingness (or even plan/roadmap) to upscale block size in the future once possible and necessary.
Now I see a killer app on the horizon that could really make Bitcoin mainstream. That's what we always wanted! And so I am asking what bitcoin-core is planning to do in the light of such very welcome news. Are they ready for it or not yet and another altcoin (or even bitcoin fork) may eat that cake?
I can't see why you are so negative and accuse me of asking miracles from anyone. I would rather expect someone (not you but someone having a say in bitcoin-core or blockstream) what their thoughts are! Are they welcoming it? Do they see technological possibilities of increasing on-chain capacities in the light of recent advances in research? Can we scale up to accomodate 100 Mill. users for lightning/payment channels as needed for Megaupload? Or do they want to remain passive and prefer seeing Megaupload use another altcoin while keeping Bitcoin a low-capacity coin of limited practical value because of (allegedly) more decentralization?
This is an open question out of interest, and I ask to treat it like that with respect. Thank you.


I am asking because I do not have a solution. Others have better understanding of the state of research in the field, hence I am asking. What's wrong with that? You sound as if I have attacked anybody in my post - I didn't!
From what I know, as I wrote above, there are various new techniques on the horizon that afaik allow significant upscaling w/o compromising on decentralization, and afaik also bitcoin core is working on it!
Hence my questions about where are we on this in the light of the news from Megaupload.
Please treat my question respectfully and pragmatically and without emotions. Thank you.

I don't agree that the big pockets can control the market as you describe. It is a wide spread conspiracy/fallacy.
Even if you have big pockets, you cannot sell arbitrarily at 900, there must be buyers. If the orderbook is small, you crash the price faster than you want.
But if you want to buy cheap, there are also other buyers at 600. You want get as many cheap coins as you wish. Prices will rise faster than you planned. Once prices are up at 900 again, you look what happend, and it is well possible that your net profit is negative from your market manipulation. It is not that easy.

sorry, but if I want to pay my bitcoin bill with litecoin, i have to go through an exchange like e.g. shapeshift.io.
but that involves TWO Bitcoin on-chain transactions. i.e. if people pay their bitcoin prices with altcoins it is even worse - Bitcoin's tx capacity would then reduce to only 125,000 tx per day.
so the only(*) way out is if openbazaar accepts other altcoins directly, w/o going through bitcoin. and of course this will happen if openbazaar grows as we all hope.
(*) of course when assuming bitcoin block size remains at 1 MB max and is not increased (which would be utmost evil [even in the face of technological progress] as people with modem dial-up connections would be expelled from being able to operate full nodes).

This would require to...
- (1) first identify proof of burn addresses to identify the amount of bitcoins provably lost
- (2) add 50 BTC from genesis block (not spendable by definition of Bitcoin protocol)
- (3) collect all reports of otherwise "lost" coins and weight these with a probability that the report is true and not a duplicate. This includes satoshi coins, the report of that Englishman having put his hard drive with 4000 BTC in the garbage, the various reports in this thread, and many more.

Not quite true. The difficulty adjustment occurs not in a floating manner, but in a fixed 2-week (more accurately 2016 block) grid. If they (the chinese miners) drop, block times would get veeeery long and the next difficulty adjsutment may take place in 20 weeks, not 2 weeks. during that time block times would be 100 minutes on averyge and TX Tput reduce to 0.3 TX/s. This would certainly kill Bitcoin and everybody would leve towards other coins. After 20 weeks, I do not think they will come back.
Blockstream cannot be changed as long as they enjoy the support of the Chinese miners, because Bitcoin depends on the Chinese miners. Hence, if Blockstream bribes the miners, blockstream can enforce DE-FACTO control over bitcoin.
It is not true that "the users" are free. Unless of course they fork Bitcoin, and probably this is exactly what will happen.

Bitcoin is a *settlement system* without government!
At 250,000 transactions per day world-wide it can hardly be considered "money".
But no problem for Openbazaar, it can easily open-up to support Litecoin, Ether, Monero, Vertcoin or other crypto-currencies - this will easily multiply Openbazaar's transaction capacity 100-fold and remove any practical limitations.
@_date: 2016-04-07 12:47:44

The huge problem, however, is that this is a re-definition of the original social contract of Bitcoin, which you are probably aware of. Bitcoin was designed and defined as, and always promised to be, a "Peer to Peer Electronic *Cash* System", and not a Peer to Peer Electronic *Settlement* System. This social contract should not be changed unless there is quasi unanimous agreement in the community and amongst all stakeholders to do so!
If a change of Bitcoin's characteristics is coerced upon Bitcoin by a small group of stakeholders (parts of the Bitcoin software programmers, controllers of the most influential Bitcoin forums, and Chinese miners), Bitcoin's credibility of a "decentralized" system gets deeply damaged - nobody could trust the Bitcoin network any more, nobody would know what fundamental change of Bitcoin's characteristics will happen next.
It would be much better if a new Altcoin would be created that formulates a clear and strong social contract as a "settlement system" and is then designed and used as such.

That is not Layer 3! Smart contracts or rsk are NOT running on top of LN, get educated.
RSK is running on top of BITCOIN directly, so it is L2, not L3.
It is however conceivable that LN is ruunning on top of RSK. So in that case LN would be L3, running on top of RSK (L2) running on top of Bitcoin (L1).
But saying that Rsk is L3 running on top of LN's L2 makes no sense.

It is obvious that this is a fraud. Bitcoin is limited, a business model like this cannot work long-term - sooner or later debtors will default and creditor lose their money - unless of course the "company" runs away with the money much earlier, which is the normal pattern in these cases.

This is a bad advice! You should multiply by your ACTUAL TX size, not by the median size.The two can, and in every individual case likely will, very often deviate a lot from each other. So with this advice you are very likely to massively underpay or overpay.
(edit: Likewise, if you guess what will be the number after tossing a dice, guessing "3.5" is a very bad strategy - it will turn out wrong in 100% of cases although it is the average and also the median)

Donald Trump is setting the price by order de mufti, and this price is valid for all the world for all buyers and sellers, until a new price is set by tweet update.
If there are more (buyers) or more sellers for this centrally set price, some people cannot buy (or sell) their bitcoins.
Of course, some my be willing to buy (sell) for a slightly higher (lower) price, but this is not allowed! If a counterpart tried to sell to (buy from) that person for that slightly higher (lower) price, The Donald will intervene and nuke both actors, then torture them in Guantanamo and finally send them to his bud Kim for further abuse.
It's why nobody will trade for prices other than those centrally set by the central world ruler.

If you enter your private key or wallet seed words at a WEBSITE then you give a copy of the key that accesses your bitcoins to that website's operator. (would you give the keys to your house to a stranger?)
**NEVER EVER DO THAT!!!**
If you did so, your keys are compromised. Create a new wallet with a new seed and transfer your bitcoins to there, before the website steals your bitcoins.
Examples of good wallet apps for Android: Coinomi, Samurai, Mycelium, Electrum (Electrum uses a seed format that is incompatible with the rest of the eco system).
Your bitcoins are always stored on the decentralized blockchain. The seed or keys are your authorisation to spend your bitcoins.
If an app or website asks you to register with an account, it is not safe, and if a website asks for your seed or private key, it is likely a scam, in best case insecure and risky.

Theory: Random generator in bitcoin.com wallet is broken/has a weakness, similarly to former Android randomnexx bug some years ago.
bitcoin.com wallet programmer knows that, so after (bad-randomness-) wallet generation, the app checks if the generated address already exist, by checking the blockchain. If yes, it re-generates a new wallet, just to be sure no collisions exist. This way, normal users won't face collisions and think they are safe. But in the meantime, the bitcoin.com wallet programmer can attack the keys in his garage and steal bitcoins at a future point in time.


That would be outright stupid to rely on this on a smartphone! Why trust an external site (random.org) for something as sensitive as Bitcoin?!
ANd why on a smartphone. A smartphone has TONS of truely physical randomness by nature:
* microphone
* camera
* light sensor
* g-rate (x,y , z)
* magnetic sensor (x, y, z)
* gyroscope sensor (x, y, z)
* Screen touch
Each of these sensors alone can easily generate truly random sequences of 256 bits, by a half-way reasonable algorithm.
By XOR-ing all the different random 256-bit-sequences with each other, one would get an even more reliably truely random 256-bit-sequence. In fact, as long as ONE of these many sequences is random, the total sequence would be random.

Respectfully, **no**! In this example you bought everything 'at 7.5k', not 10k!
With cost averaging, the *reciprocal* prices get averaged.
If people do not understand, take an example. Your example! Assume you spend 15k each month to buy bitcoins.
- In the first month price is 15k/BTC, so you purchase 1 BTC.
- In the second month price is 5k/BTC, so you purchase 3 BTC.
So in total you purchased 4 BTC and paid 30k for it, i.e. 7.5k per BTC.
Or:       
1 / ((1/5000 + 1/15000)/2) = 7500.
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:59:26
See 
Currently you are likely to get your TX confirmed within less than 100 blocks (17 hours) for 50 satoshi/byte.
AverageTX size is 226 bytes, so that would cost 11300 satoshis = 0.00011300 BTC = 0.11300 mBTC = 1.7 EUR, which is far away from your 20 USD.
Of course if your wallet contains many many small inputs that'd have to be collected, it can get more expansive, but that would be very special.

sorry if I was not clear.


Simply speaking, I want to spend ("sweep") **as much as possible.**
That means, the best is in the current situation to spend from the 50 mBTC, i.e. sweep 50 mBTC, get 49.x mBTC and pay the rest as tx fee, i.e. 49.x + tx fee = "exactly 50 mBTC".
A normal wallet would spend from 50.00009 mBTC, but this would imply that I only get 48.x mBTC and pay the rest as tx fee. clearly, this is worse, and I'd rather leave the 50.00009 mBTC alone, because this gives me more money.


if you know a wallet that behaves this way, please tell me.
All wallets I know would try to send the 50mBTC **plus** tx fee, and I do not know a wallet where I as a user can specify the amount of "spent money PLUS tx fees" equals exactly 50 mBTC.


Of course, but as said, that's exactly what I want to avoid.

A bitcoin wallet is not "created on the blockchain". Never!
A wallet is created on your own device (computer, phone, or hardware wallet) by simply generating a long random number that is turned into a 12 word seed typically, for better human readability (that is your secret private key that shall never leave your device!). And that wallet device does not need any access to neither internet nor the blockchain for the process of creating a bitcoin wallet.
If anybody tells something different, it is likely a scam (fraud).

Strictly, formally speaking, the title is incorrect. Because, If the block was "invalid", it was by definition not a Bitcoin block. Instead it was just a sequence of 1s and 0s that happened to look "almost" like a Bitcoin block, but not quite.
So it was not a Bitcoin block. It was as little a Bitcoin block as a poem by edgar allen poem in digital form. Or my income statement in *.png format.
Nobody would say "Bitcoin had a poem", because the poem does not follow Bitcoin's protocol rules, so Bitcoin cannot "have" it. Likewise, Bitcoin can, by defenition, never "HAVE" an invalid(!) block.

It depends to what extend you scale L1:

(b) Scale L1 such that everyone can buy coffees on L1.


Clearly, (b) is not viable long-term. Probably even bcash advocated see this now. (a) means L1 is scaled up less than what would be necessary for (b).
Clearly, this impacts the way ppl buy coffee with bitcoin long term - either via L1 or via L2.

Mining is one aspect of centralization.
The other aspect is freedom of running a full node with low budget and resources. If anyone can run a full node s/he can validate the blocks by oneself and is independent of what big players say about what block is right or wrong. In that case nobody, not even a majority of miners, can change the rules.
If blocks are very big and can only be verified by big players, individuums must trust big players. This is a fundamental change in freedom and decentralization.
@_date: 2018-09-23 22:26:27


Technology (capacity, bandwidth...) typically grows exponentially, while blockchain size grows linearly for constant max. block size. So technologically there will be room for some gradual block increase in the future without endangering decentralization. As I mentioned in another comment, long term such a step is indispensible to enable LN (opening tx) for all people on earth. Without blocksize increase ever(!), LN will be limited to some elites. The vast amount of people will then be able to access the bitcoin network only indirectly via intetmediaries like banks or wallet companies like coinbase (suboptimum solution), or via higher- capa sidechains (the better solution).
So with L1 blocksize increase we open up the strategic possibility for every individuum to open LN channels decentrally. With fixing current block space forever, we close this option of L2 access, and only offer somewhat more centralized options (intermediaries, sidechains) ti the open public.
These are the trade-offs, in principle, just stating them. Judgement of these options is another topic. But first the options need to be understood by everyone before starting any judgements. Just saying this to everyone here :-)

Lightning alone cannot put the final nail into the scaling debate.
If you concede that Bitcoin is destined for mainstream adoption (i.e. at least 10 Billion users one day, inkl. companies and machine to machine payment), we can easily calculate that current Bitcoin Layer 1 capacity is just enough to open/close one payment channel per earth inhabitant per lifetime (100 years)!
That is hardly even remotely close to "enough".
So further scaling approaches are needed. One might be sidechains (with lightning networks also running on top of these sidechains). Moderate increase of L1 capacity (to not exceed technological evolution) of Bitcoin might be another building block of this.
But whenever I read that a SINGLE approach is the solution to solve Bitcoin scaling, I have to strongly disagree.
* L1 scaling alone cannot possibly do it (but might be one part of it)
* Lightning Networks alone cannot possibly do it  (but are an important part)
* Sidechains alone cannot possibly do it (but are an important part)

In general, blocks MUST be full. Otherwise, there's no fee market. without fee market transactions are free and the network can be attacked with spam. Also at one point fees must compensate for reduced/vanished block reward. Bitcoin is unviable long-term if blocks are not full. An inconvenient truth to all advocates of "free lunch", I know. Fortunately, another crypto called bitcoin cash (bch) is following another approach, so believers of their approach of limited time horizon can join them if they do not undetstand.

What you are saying is largely correct.
But you left out one aspect in your reply. You forgot to address the point by that L1 space is needed to even REACH the L2. What's your answer to this problem?
Is it that only elites will be able to do so, while the vast majority will only use centralized accounts like coinbase? My understanding is that this is the inevitable consequence when not increasing L1 capacity EVER, so why not naming it then? (I am not judging, just putting 2+2 together). Not naming this trivial truth and instead trying to hide it is what causes the enormous distrust of many users and pushes them into the arms of Roger &amp; Craig &amp; Co.
To be very clear: Everyone doing the math can easily calculate: With today's Bitcoin L1 capa, its block space is completely used up if every earth inhabitant is opening/closing one lightning channel only ONCE in a LIFETIME. That's really easy to remember and proves that it is impossible for all people on earth to participate in Bitcoin, not even via L2, if L1 capa is not increased EVER.
That's why my conclusion always was, and still is, that L1 capa must be increased eventually, and cautiously (not today, though - we have still time until mass adoption needs to be accommodated).
Edit: Another part of the solution is sidechains like rsk, that have themselves a much higher L1 capa than Bitcoin. While less decentralized than Bitcoin itself, they still provide "acceptable" decentralization that can serve the big public's need. Even if using a federated peg, it's still much much better decentralized than serving the huge public via centralized companies like coinbase. People can directly buy RSK tokens with fiat, so they can participate in the L2 sidechain without a single L1 Bitcoin transaction. This is different to lightning, where one  L1 Bitcoin transaction is needed per person before participation in LN's L2. Note: Needless to say that it is of course possible to also build a LN on top of a sidechain.

I wouldn't necessarily agree.
If we look at L1 alone, I agree! Even doubling, quadroupling or 1000-folding the blockspace is by far not enough to allow everybody paying his/her coffee.
However, 100- or 1000-folding may be enough to allow everybody on earth free(!) access to LN L2 (which current 1 or 2 MB definitely cannot achieve). And that factor can be feasible with a 20-30 year time horizon without sacrificing decentralization. Admitting these circumstances is very different from admitting we don't need L2 at all (which is obvious nonsense), so why not making this clear? It can help lowering tensions and see if the other side is also able to be pragmatic or not.

My assumption is that current bear market will last longer than the previous ones and will lead us (clearly) below 3k. 6k support won't hold, I expect. Almost all "experts" expect that the bottom has been reached. Usually such over-optimism means that the bottom has in fact N̲O̲T̲ been reached.
Edit: funny how I get 2 downvotes in 4 minutes. This is exactly my point! People want to "enforce" the bull market and downvote other opinions as if they can thereby change market's direction. Sweet bitter fallacy.

I think these people GREATLY overestimate my influence on the markets :-) lol
But as we talk about market psychology, also the opposite viewpoint is possible: As long as everybody says "6k was the bottom", long-term experienced people know that optimism is still too high and the market is not yet at its lowest point. Old investors know these cycles. Warren Buffet says you must buy when everybody is screaming and crying desperately, and sell if optimism is endless. We are not yet at that desperate point.
However, if many people talk like me, market observers will say "see, now the mood is in the basement, the bottom is reached, buy, buy now!"

Problem with lightning is if the other side has less than n BTC in his payment channel, with n btc being less than btc tx fee. In this case it is worthwhilie for the other side to steal your bitcoin by broadcasting an older transaction. If you discover it and broadcast the latest state of the payment channel, you get ALL coins of the opponent from the payment channel, but due to the high tx fees you'd still lose.

Electronical L1 fiat money is not even ALLOWED to be used by normal ppl. It is only allowed to be used by central banks and private banks. Only physical L1 money (aka coin and paper notes) are alliwed to be used by normal ppl.


not every bitcoin enthusiast wants to rebuild the current "layered" system with bitcoin. they dream of a "flat" structure, but of course that is not possible to scale.


the point of increasing blocks is not to accelerate tx conf times but to increase capa. just saying.

Bitcoin's historical social contract always has been that the 1MB limit is just a temporary safety net, and all informed participators in Bitcoin were relying on that they can take the bitcoin-core developers by their word. Breaking this social contract without broad consensus is dangerous, probably even irresponsible!


I couldn't agree more! **Blockstream** devs who are breaking with the original vision of Satoshi and hence(!) breaking the social contract(!) of all Bitcoin stakeholders should definitely present themselves as a **separate team** with different goals and should not hijack bitcoin-core.

If it is to enable buying coffee for everyone on L1, it is a nogo, because it would destroy decentralisation and long-term viability of the main (L1) network, i.e. a complete irresponsible desaster.
If it is to allow all people, long-term, to access L2 such that they then can buy coffee on L2, then agreed. And I even go further and say: Should not only be "agreed" but be understood and be promoted as part of the long-term strategy! And of course promoted in a way that clearly and decisively distances itself from the first variant above.

I am sorry, but if you say you understand the "market concept" and understand what "orderbooks" are and how they work, and you still think this has ~~anything~~ *nothing [typo corrected]* to do with the indicated price being different depending on how much you want to buy/sell, then I am sorry to say that you have indeed understood nothing.
If you say you don't observe this effect with Circle, then maybe Circle has implemented a margin until which the price does not change depending on order hight, to make it "look" more consistent to the normal user like yourself. This is then an implementation detail of the exchange. For example, Circle may look at its order book and decide to show a price that suits a 1000 USD order for all orders &lt;=1000 USD. So if you as a user make an order of 1 USD or 999 USD or 1000 USD, you'll see the same price. But in fact Circle COULD give you a better offer for a 1 USD order, but does not do so to make it "look" more consistent.
Coinbase's behaviour is absolutely logical and an indication that you get the best offer applicable to any given order size. It is not a proof that the best price is offered to you. BUT: If Circle is offering the same price to you for a 1 USD and a 1000 USD order, then THIS is proof that they do NOT give you the best price for any given order like a 1 USD order.

yes. almost. my understanding of a coin with constant supply of new coins (n coins per time t) implies that at some point the rate at which new coins are generated must equal the rate at which coins are lost forever (due to technical errors, people dying, etc.) so this is the only model that finds an equilibrium at some point - neither in- nor de-flationary.

Maybe a concrete example can show you that you missed something:

* Output 2 = 0.5 BTC (own change address)
* TX Fee = 1.0 BTC
Double Spend:
* Input = 2.5 BTC (same as above)
* Output 1 = 0.1 BTC (to the recipient)
* Output 2 = 1.3 BTC (own change address)
* TX Fee = 1.1 BTC
Second example - to harm the recipient:
Original TX (your example):
* Input = 2.0 BTC
* Output = 1.0 BTC (to the recipient)
* TX Fee = 1.0 BTC
Double Spend:
* Input = 2.0 BTC (same as above)

increasing the block size limit is a step in reverting a previous hard fork that INTRODUCED the 1MB limit. THAT was the hard fork nobody is complaining about now.
we had various other hard forks in the past, e.g. about the data base inconsistency in March 2013.
all these hard forks have in common to KEEP bitcoin as it was originally designed to be.
increasing 21mill cap is completely different, it changes the fundamental characteristic and promise of bitcoin. hence a very very very bad comparison - actually it is so different it can hardly be compared at all.

Bitcoin won't change sha256.
there is one serious coin (no premine or similar scam) that has written on its agenda to be and to REMAIN asic free and change the hash algo if necessary to keep it asic free. that coin is called vertcoin. in fact, it has already canged the algo once by hard fork (mining is similarly efficient on cpu and gpu as it seems). other than that it is quite solid, quite close to bitcoin (e.g. same block reward halving plan) with moderate adjustments (more seemless difficulty adjustment, 2.5 min block time, max of 84mill coins), and has an interesting additional optional feature called "stealth addresses" for better privacy.

It could be also possible with [R-RBF]( a concept that allows shifting some (but only SOME) (see use case 2) amount from output(s) towards tx fees in the double-spend, to avoid that payer can harm the payee all that much.
R-RBF (Restricted RBF) comes close to a solution to unlock a stuck tx without cpfp (which increases blockchain) an without FSS-RBF (which also slightly increases blockchain and requieres the wallet to have an extra "unused input" in reserve - which can be realized by smart wallet SW).

Why should I try - I have no reason to open a coinbase account just for that. I am not a trader. If I want to buy long term, I buy at bitcoin.de. I am from Europe.
Of course coinbase is an exchange, even if it does not look like other exchanges from the user's point of view. How should they buy/sell customers' bitcoins, if not on a market? Just because orders are executed instantly, this does not mean that there is no market. Of course there is, you are just not seeing it. They may cooperate with other exchanges or so - in the end every buy or sell of a coinbase customer must be MATCHED somewhere on the marketplace - that's the essential point. And that's exactly why price depends on volume, it is really that simple and trivial - law of nature of a market place if you will.

bitcoin stands for the ideals of freedom and decentralization. many bitcoiners share these ideals - not only when it comes to currency, but also w.r.t. how people should interact in social context.
In some bitcoin related topics are deleted by mods - not because they are spam or inappropriate, but simply because mods don't agree with it. they even ban users for sending posts with according content. bitcoin mods have created a questionable definition of what is an "altcoin" and arbitrarily defined that certain bitcoin implementations are an "altcoin", thereby justifying censorship against such posts by saying that the post is about an "altcoin" and not "bitcoin".
This is considered anti-social, centralistic, undemocratic and dictatoric by many bitcoin users, esp. as is the "de-facto" standard subreddit for bitcoin by its name and historical number of subscribers, which is unlikely to change easily due to the network effect (which bitcoiners know better than others). So these bitcoin users are of the opinion that the mods of should keep up bitcoin's ideals and high standards of open-mindness in the moderation practices of this subreddit.
A minority of other users, and of course the mods themselves (not all, but most, and formost do not share these views. Instead they are of the opinion that they can censor articles and ban users based on self-defined rules that violate the principles of freedom and decentralization. They say that everybody is free to use other subreddits (with less public reach due to the network effect), so there's no violation of democratic principles as a whole. They are denying that they bias public opinion by applying one-sided censorship in the leading bitcoin subreddit.

Exactly, and I explained it this way, just without mentioning technical terms like "merkle root". For didactical purposes explaining someone like a kid (or a lawyer or banker or journalist) the essence of something, the exact technical terms are often not needed.

Hope they never accept an ETF that fails this criterion:
Each dollar/euro/whatever that flows into the ETF must be backed by a corresponding amount of true bitcoins that the ETF has to purchase on the open Bitcoin market.
Anything like Paper-Bitcoins (like Paper-Gold) must be prevented. ETFs must know that if they want to be approved they must fulfil this criterion.
Otherwise we'll end up with a situation where big investors buy paper-bitcoin, and demand for real bitcoins diminishes.

I think you and misunderstand each other, and both of you seem to argue a bit as if the other one is an enemy that wants to do something bad.
I think it is NO question that L1 ALONE cannot scale TODAY. However, also with L2 extensions some L1 blocksize increase may likely be needed EVENTUALLY to avoid that only elites have access to Bitcoin. See my other comment about the "why".
Another point is technological advances. It is not unrealistic to assume that in 20 years a 100 MB blockspace is just as unproblematic to decentralization as 2MB is today. With such a factor the access to LN by everyone would be greatly eased.
Ignoring technological advance completely is just as wrong/naive/manipulative as claiming Bitcoin needs no L2 and can scale on L1 alone.

An Opel Manta driver (let's call him "Manni") is hitch hiking, and a Mercedes stops. In the car, Manni discovers a strange red dot on the console near the radio and the air conditioning. He asks the Mercedes driver what it is. The Mercedes driver explains: "Well, you know, at times I am picking up a nice women hitch hiking. When she dicovers that red spot she'd ask what it is, and so an innocent conversation starts... and you know, as we talk, we get closer and eventually, well, you know... ;-)"
Manni thinks that's a cool idea. So he applies a red dot in his Opel Manta, and soon he picks up a Lady hitch hiking. Then, as expected, she asks: "What's that red dot good for?" --&gt; He: "Ey ficken ey!?" [you've got to translate that from German to Englisch].

You cannot derive anything from that mathematically. These are two different things:
* market cap: unit = USD
* remit market: unit = USD/year, where "year" is arbitrary, one could equally well use "decade" or "minute" as the time unit.
So you get two numbers of different units - how are you comparing these?
Note that one bitcoin can change hands thousands of times per year, so 1 billion USD of bitcoin market cap is sufficient to serve for trillions in USD of remittances per year. What is the settling time in a remittance operation? 1 minute? 5 minutes? 10 seconds??
I think it is a huge fallacy to compare amounts of USD PER YEAR units with total USD amounts, as many people do. Always remember that "1 year" is completely arbitrary, and for example for remittances it would be more suitable to use the settling time of a remittance deal, which is closer to a minute than to a year.
So what is global remittance volume per minute? 600 billion USD / 365/24/60 = 1.1 Million USD. So current BTC market cap (~5 Billion USD) is good to serve the global remittance market 1000s of times as far as I can see.

Bitcoin Core (BTCC) is a hard fork of Bitcoin Clashic (BCHC), fork date 20 May 2018. HF changes are the difficulty adjustment algorithm (DAA) and replay protection.
Bitcoin Clashic again is the original Bitcoin Cash (Bcash, BCH) chain, until Bcash hard-forked away on 13 Nov 2017.
And Bitcoin Cash (BCH) hard-forked away from Bitcoin (BTC) back on 1 Aug 2017.
Summary: 
Now Roger Ver can no longer refer to Bitcoin as "Bitcoin Core", as the scammer enjoyed to up to now, because now it is visible to the world that Bitcoin Core is actually another coin.
By the way, Bitcoin Core currently [trades]( at around 1 BTCC = 10 USD.

Edit: This is also good for passing the bitcoins to your inheritor:
You send x BTC to a time locked wallet for your children. You give the priv key to your children already today. If you have an accident or die early, they get the bitcoins (after the time lock expiry) and it won't be lost. But if you do not die, you can spend the coins earlier, as you like, as usual, with the other private key, the "spend early key", that only you possess.

You can say $1m is equally unlikely as $1. That is ok. But $0 is extremely different from $1, and extremely more unlikely. $0 means nobody, not a single person on this planet, wants to have a satoshi.

@_date: 2014-06-11 22:39:16
Yes and No.
*No* because strictly speaking Bitcoin is DESIGNED as a 100% decentralized and TRUSTLESS system. This means, any miner that boots up from scratch, connects to the Bitcoin network and downloads the blockchain from scratch must be able to decide which blockchain is the correct one without making any assumption as to which Bitcoin node can be trusted (hence "trustless"). The rule is simple: "Amongst all valid blockchains, the *longest* one is the correct one." Due to this rule, in above example the maliciously generated "51% chain" is the longest one and will be accepted.
*Yes* because, PRACTICALLY an attack like the one outlined here would be clearly visible to the entire Bitcoin community. The community will not be willing to accept the malicious blockchain. However, this moment will be a CHANGE OF PARADIGM: At this moment Bitcoin is no longer a TRUSTLESS system. Instead, a new Bitcoin SW would have to be distributed that has other critetia built-in as to what is accepted as a valid blockchain. As a practical example, some TRUSTED bitcoin nodes could be hard-coded into the Bitcoin SW, and a blockchain is only accepted if it is the longest blockchain AND if it is not rejected by (the majority of) these TRUSTED NODES.
Practically, this would not change a lot and Bitcoin would continue to exist, now with the risk of being brute-force attacked by 51% being eliminated. However, this would constitute a fundamental change of paradigm, because Bitcoin would no longer be a trustless system. Instead, people (i.e. Bitcoin community, core developers) would have to AGREE whom (i.e. which Bitcoin node) they trust to act as a valid node to reject malicious blockchain forks. If they cannot agree, it may theoretically happen that different Bitcoin nodes accept differen trusted nodes, and that the public blockchain may fork as a result. Practically though, it is hardly conceivable that this happens, and it is more likely that a system of trusted nodes would work well, because it would be continuously supervised by a vigilant community.
Tl;dr: such 51% attack would work only once. Then new Bitcoin SW with a list of trusted nodes would be distributed and the Bitcoin network would PRACTICALLY be more robust than ever, albeit sacrificing its property of a fully trustless system. From this moment on such a 51% attack would never succeed again.

You completely missunderstand the threat we talk about. Completely! Sorry.
Someone has already upvoted your nonsense, so education is needed, so let me explain (please read up to the end):


irrelevant rhetoric - ignored.


pure speculation, and ibm is not the likely attacker. hence irrelevant rhetoric - ignored.


If an attacker cracks a secret key locally and then spends the associated coins on the bitcoin network via broadcast, it has global implications on the *whole* network. So your differentiation betw. local and global ("whole") makes absolutely no sense at all.


No! This is not the attack we talk about. Quantum computers would crack elliptic curve cryptography, not sha256.  So double spending is not the threat" Stealing foreign coins is the treat we talk about!


As said, you are completely wrong. Quantum computers cannot 51% attack the network, because they cannot attack sha256, so they cannot mine blocks any faster. (And if they could, the 51% attack would be a major, not minor threat).
Instead, quantum computers can find the secret keys from public keys, thus allowing them to spend bitcoins from addresses that have been spent from already (because spending discloses the input addresse's public key).

I am sorry, but your theory is impossible, I can prove it wrong by a simple contradiction. In short: if your theory is true, then settled LN bitcoins would be locked (i.e. unusable) FOREVER. Because if they are not locked, the thief (call him Bob) can spend them to a third party (call her Carol), and Carol can spend to Dave, etc. Then, 2 months later, I (Alice) find out that Bob defrauded me on the LN channel, and I publich my truely latest LN channel state to the blockchain. Now acc. to your theory all payments would have to be rolled back, incl. the payments that Carol and Dave received 2 months ago.
So I am 100% sure that this theory is wrong, because if true, it would render the complete Bitcoin blockchain unusable, because no receiver of Bitcoins (Dave, Carol, ...). could rely on the Bitcoin payment being final, not even after 1000 confirmations.

But this way, they could say: "Yes, see, these are my bitcoins, yes, I own so many. But they are time-locked, see? I cannot send them to you now."
Yet, they are in fact not time-locked, and after the attack is over, they can do what they want with it.

Nobody in this thread has explained what is really new about this proposal, but certainly it will always be necessary to monitor the blockchain online, by principle, because the blockchain cannot know how many further transactions happened off-chain after the LN channel state that was settled to the blockchain.

Then it was obviously a misunderstanding between you and It is simply impossible to allow a wrongly closed LN channel to correct this ANY time in the future, because the Bitcoins that are settled when the LN channel is closed want to be used (as I explained with "Carol" and "Dave"). But they cannot be used if they can be rolled back any point in the future. So there must be a misunderstadning.
You can easily find this out yourself, by sole thinking. You do not have to be a rocket scientist (or Bitcoin programmer) to understadn this, it is fully sufficient to understand some fundamentals on Bitcoin principles. SO I am 100% sure there was/is a misunderstadning, and you should be equally sure.
*Or: If a nobel price winning physicist tells me that sun sets in the east, I am 100% sure that there must be a misunderstadning, because I know from basic understading of nature that this is impossible, even without having studied astronomy.

What does it mean in practice? If 100,000 transactions happen off-chain in the LN channel, and they are numbered with sequence numbers 0 to 99,999, and then a fraudster tries to settle the LN channel to the blockchain at state 99,995 to the network (which is of course possible as the blockchain does not know that there were 4 further transactions), then what is different with today's solution compared to the new solution? What is the advantage of the new solution from user scenario point of view? Can you name one scenario as an example where the new solution offers something that the old solution does not? I think without such example scenario, nobody will understand, and anybody who cannot name and explain such a scenario has not understood the paper.

@_date: 2018-05-19 18:05:25
I'll explain some basics to you:


From the public key. That's what QC cryptography attacks are all about - calculating the priv key from the pub key.


Because the attackers follow the rules, too. Your node could not see if a spending is justified or the result of a cracked secret key.


no, I neither said/wrote nor meant "mysteriously".


Yes, sure. If some amount was ever spent from an address, its public(!) key is on the blockchain forever. From that, QC can calculate the private key. That's how it works. Cool, isn't it?


Nobody said so. Don't argument against self-invented strawman counter arguments, please.


Hopefully your priv keys are under YOUR control, not under exchanges' controls. Otherwise, it's not really "your" bitcoins.


I did not take the assumption that YOU would own the QC. Other poeople/orgs have other motives. General rule of human nature: What can be done will be done.




You'd have to be a bank to create an account at a central bank.

On the other hand: If it gets more widely adopted and just 1 Billion people each keep bitcoin "pocket money" worth on average 10 USD in their private smartphone Bitcoin wallets (e.g. as "prepaid" accounts to pay for occasional paywalls or other web content), it would push prices up clearly above 1000 usd.
@_date: 2018-08-25 09:46:00
These are very basic questions. Anybody not being able to answer these questions is not really in the position of "explaining" Bitcoin to anyone. "Telling about" Bitcoin - yes, "explaining" Bitcoin - no.


The task is defined in the Bitcoin protocol. It was created by Satashi Nakamoto, the anonymous creator of the Bitcoin protocol (and thereby also the creator of the rules for the mathematical task of mining bitcoins). This task is about calculating sha256 hashes from some "random data" and hoping to get hashes as a result that are smaller than a certain value (the difficulty limit). Part of these "random data" are a function of the previous block and of the transactions contained in the new block, other part is really arbitrary data added by the respective miner itself. So the protocol "creates" the concrete mining task for the next block by its own rules, as written in the source code of the Bitcoin protocol.


The Bitcoin protocol has a mechanism called "difficulty adjustment" to adapt difficulty to the miner network total computing power. This way the world network of miners, all together, will always mine approx. 1 block every 10 minutes.


Yes it is possible, and it has happened plenty of times already. These "upgrades" are called "forks" and they follow different rules than the original Bitcoin because of such "upgrade", therefore they are incompatible to the original Bitcoin. As a result, each such fork creates a new crypto coin that shares the same history with Bitcoin up to the point where the fork happened. Meanwhile, Bitcoin itself continues to exist with the old rule set.

Ok, if all remains in principle the same in terms of attack scenarios and punishment, and this is just an implementation efficiency improvement for the watch-tower, such that surveillance of huge amounts of LN channels becomes cheaper, then this is a good thing.
Then it should be summarized exactly like this, so that it is comprehensible by everybody (but probably experts have difficulties to speak generally comprehensible language, in most fields):
"This solution reduces the memory consumption and hence the cost of watch-towers observing the blockchain for fraudulent settlements (=settlements of obsolete LN channel states)."

Yes, this is how fiat money works. Every money unit is debt.
Killing debt means killing money.
Sadly, still many people are surprised about this, which means people are not educated properly. Worldwide lack of education.
PS: More precisely, you can kill money without killing debt (e.g. by burning a dollar bill), but it is impossible to kill debt without killing the exact same amount of money. Consequently, there is even more debt than money, so after using all money to kill debt, no money is left but some debt is still left.

I consider this pretty arrogant and ignorant. User  apparently takes it for granted that Bitcoin will succeed, but in fact nothing can be taken for granted, and nothing is 100% certain about the future. This is arrogance. Even though probably around 98% of the bitcoiners are quite convinced about Bictcoin's value proposition and consequently its success and future price increase, this does not have to be true.
From a non bitcoiner's perspective (and yes, there are non-Bitcoiner's on this planet, some simply because they have a non-tech and non-finance background or are busy with other things in their life), the Bitcoin phenomenon still looks like one of these many bubbles that existed in the distant as well as near past, and they are naturally sceptical.
So Bitcoiners should behave more respectful in front of non-bitcoiners and especially avoid the arrogance, aggressiveness and insults that above tweet shows. Such behaviour just harms Bitcoin's reputation and will not convince a single Bitcoin sceptic - on the contrary.

I am thinking in terms of general principles, you are thinking in absolute numbers, that causes the misunderstanding. Also EN is not my mothertongue. I made a relative, no absolute, consideration.
ASSUMING (!) that 10 usd as of beg. of 2013 was fair, then today's value of 300 is overvalued, compared to fundamentals, and the bubbles of 2013 were even more overvalued, so the current correction is not surprising at all.
I am sorry I did not provide all detailed references one should make in a PhD thesis like this reddit post, I thought it's ok to communicate the basic idea, and the reader gets the grasp of the idea him/herself. Apparently that's not the case and some readers try to interpret nonsense into other people's posts whenever possible, because then they feel superior themselves.
E.g. one could think of fundamentals as the nb of bitcoin users, wallet dowloads, wallets in use, blockchain transactions per week etc. There are many such metrics. I am saying that if you take these metrics you'll hardly see an increase of bitcoin usage by a factor more than 10 between Jan.2013 and now, so the price rose much too fast in 2013 (caused by singular events) and it is just correcting now back to a more reasonable/fair/suitable/however-you-call-it price level.
So it's not surprising that in 2014 the price is continuously falling despite the continuous (slow) increase of adoption. Remember that THIS is the original topic of the thread (whether this is surprising or explainable), not what is the fair price value in absolute terms.
Try to read the post in the right context, then you won't misinterpret. All I did is providing an explanation why in 2014 a continuous drop in price level despite simultaneous rise in adoption is not surprising but well explainable when considering fundamental factors, and I used example figures to make this easier to grasp and more illustrative, not because I think that 10 or 100 or whatever number as such is the "right" price in absolute terms.
If you still don't get it, I am sorry. I am sure many other readers get the idea of what I am saying.

Moon is when 1 BTC=8300 €=11400 USD.
Because if you stack 21 Million bitcoins on top of
each other, you get a column of height 384400 km. This is the distance earth-moon.
So one bitcoin has a thickness of 20 yards=18.30 m. So a mBTC is still 1.83 cm thick. This is 8.3 times thicker than a Euro coin (2.2 mm). So the intrinsic moon value of a mBTC is 8.3 € =

Unfortunately, really pretty much 100%, or even more than 100% of the money is debt (due to physically destroyed/lost bank notes). See also other sub-branches of this post.
Mind that also M0 (e.g. physical bank notes inside banks' ATMs) is debt. This is what the private banks owe the central bank (they borrowed it from the central bank for interest [unless interest rate=0% in youngest history...but even then it still is debt]).

which is good.


which sounds very bad... it should be always the case, otherwise there is an incentive to try fraud without the danger for being punished.


which is bad, because if the LN channel had 100,000 state updates, we do not want to load the blockchain with 100,000 transactions, but only with a single one. This is the whole purpose of LN.


But we want punishment, not just simple overwriting. As said, otherwise attackers will try to commit an older state to their advantage and know they cannot be punished for trying to defraud the other party.


I am very surprised that the possibility to allow trying to defraud without the consequence of punishment is considered a step forward. For me it is a clear step backward.

Nb. 4 is trivial and could be omitted - to get to 10000, it needs to get to 1000 first, that's a no-brainer.
What you forgot and what is extremely important and still not considered enough by the technically-dominated Bitcoin community is ease of use for SECURE* bitcoin storage. I mean offline storage were you control your priv. key yourself, and still it is so easy to setup and to use that any noob can do it! An absolutely realizable concept for this exists already, but nobody has realized it yet. Bitcoin programmers don't see the need for this and prefer to work on advanced technical features like anonymization techniques etc. (which is nice and important, too, but won't help mass adoption). Understandable from programmer's point of view, because most programmers get more fascinated by new technical concepts than by realization of usability concepts for the "dumb" end user. However, what potential a pursue in this direction can have is what the success story of Apple (the world's highest valued company, +/- same as Exxon Mobil) proves.

If a block if found too soon after the previous block, miner has no time to make full validation of all the TXs in the previoud block. But that is needed before including transactions into the new block.
As a consequence, blocks mined very shortly after the previous block are usually empty, or, like in this case, almost empty. Transactions from the mem pool cannot be included yet, because the miner had no time to find out which transactions of the mem pool can be included, and which cannot because they have been included in the previous block already. Since inclusion of wrong transactions would make the new block invalid, the miner has no choice but to mine for blocks with those transactions excluded from the new block. Only after having figured out which transactions in the mempool are not yet included in the previous block and still valid, miner can include them and then mine for such blocks.

Government can simply make new debts if they need money, they get the money from the FED (who creates it out of nothing) at almost zero interest, and they pay off the debts plus interest from new debts. That's how the fiat money system works.

Don't "believe" blindly just because you 'want' to believe.
If you study electrical engineering (or physics), look at those sensational claims with sound (not fundamental) critisism, get in touch with those inventors with the serious(!) intention to learn more and ask questions accordingly in a polite, open-minded and sincere manner, and look what answers you get, and judge them without prejudice.
I did all this long time ago and learned that there is no science at all behind it. They twist the science, sometimes use true scientific models and add a little inaccuracy (i.e. errors/own "inventions") to it, and then they get someting completly new and miracleous. Just that it doesn't exist in reality. I used to be an open-minded "want to believer", but now I learned my lesson and found out that it's stupidness at best and plain fraud at worst.
All I can say: Don't "believe" because it just sounds so good. Instead, make your own research, use your brain and judge yourself, don't have it judged by others.
Edit: PS: If all this is too burdensome for you and you just read stories of other people whom you don't even know personally, and believe it, if you think you can judge by your mis-guided over-estimated psychological skills instead of your own sound technical understanding, then you are practicing religion, not science. And one cannot argue about religion, because religion is about believing, not about arguments and evidence.

You have very bad intentions if you say that I called Nikolas Tesla a fraudster. Neither did I write this nor did I mean this!
Tesla died before I was born. I don't know him in person. Like all great inventors he found great things, but he was not unfailable and probably made some errors like many other great minds before and after him. Note that electricity and electrodynamics was a very new technology at that time and not well researched, unlike today. So it is not a shame if Tesla was not right in 100%. If your quote really originates from Tesla this was obviously one of his errors.
What I am condemning viciously is that people living TODAY are MISUSING his name to comit fraud over other people living TODAY (where the fraud weighs higher than the misuse of Tesla's name).
But as I said, the "believers" will condemn me for blasphemy, and I don't feel guilty but only sorry for them living in illusions.

It's not about right or wrong. It's not about logic. It's not about prefixes. It's just about human perception, which is outside the realm of logic and maths.
If people like "bits" because it is convenient and neat, they will use it.
I think people like it because it is small (100 satoshis) like a "bit", it is easy to remember, it has something in common with the term "bitcoin" but is still well distinguishable (if one had to abbreviate "bitcoin" one would intuitively rather say "coin" than "bit"), it doesn't run danger of being confused with altcoins, which often carry "coin" but hardly ever contain "bit" in their name (except maybe niche coins I am not aware of), it is easy to pronounce in all languages and it has only one syllable. It is a neat and simple word that just fits well in the perception of people using "bit".
That's why my bet is that "bit" will win over "uBTC" or "micros" or "mics" in common usage.
*Disclosure: I also like the term  "bit", so I am not neutral* ;-)

I also gave a reason. I started with beginning of 2013 when price was quite stable in the +/-10usd range. And I tried to point out that even if fundamental use of Bitcoin has increased by a factor 10 since then, the fair price level would now be in the +/-100usd region.

These are different things.
Already today the blockchain is what *people* decide to accept, and the Bitcoin SW is just a tool to make it easier for them to decide what should (not) be accepted. In rare cases however, human intervention might be necessary to overrule the SW's decision (remember e.g. the fork in March 2013, and also remember that new bitcoin SW versions contain checkpoints already that rule out 51% attacks reverting the blockchain beyond that block). If this human intervention serves the purpose of preventing an *obvious* fraud or technical problem, it is a no-brainer that people will move to the safe&amp;honest chain. If the intervention is not in this sense, people will just not accept and use it.
So, after all, Bitcoin is what people accept - already today! Everybody can make a change to Bitcoin SW to violate the 21 Mill limit - no problem! But hardly anyone will accept such a fork, so it is the people that decide that this is not accepted.
On the other hand, people will be  very willing to reject an obviously fraudulent blockchain fork and are likely to accept a SW modification that implements a protection layer that is able to identify and reject such chain forks automatically, should it be necessary.

Since "bits" has various meanings already in various contexts - you named some of them - one more meaning in yet another context shouldn't harm.
I wouldn't underestimate people - they know the difference between cents and dollars or euros, and between m, mm, cm, dm, km; and in US/UK even between feet, yards, inches, miles..., ounces, gallons, ...
The concept of "bits" is useful for tipping e.g. on social platforms: "2000 bits for you!" is much more appealing than "0.002 BTC for you!" (it gives you the "Dodge" feeling ;-) )
And if the newbies find out that they can even buy a pizza for these strange "bits" and have it delivered to their home, they'll get even more exited and soon understand that "bit" is to "bitcoin" what "mm" is to "km".

Safer wallets are Android Mycelium (very well thought-through security and backup strategy), best is paper wallet created on an offline computer running "bitaddress.org" in a web browser (computer must never go online after the paperwallet was created). For even more paranoid-level security, don't auto-generate your private key with any tool - the random generator might be corrupted. Only trust your own randomness: Open an empty txt editor, copy paste random chunks of text in it and mix it with random chunks of your own text - whatever comes to your mind, what you hear in the radio right now, etc. Also toss a dice many times and enter the numbers in this txt file. Etc.! Make the file as large as possible, but one page of text should be more than enough. Finally save the txt file and calculate the sha256 hash from it, on an offline computer of course. This is your (truly random) secret key!

There are ways to store btc securely w/o expensive vault.
* Save an arbitrary computerfile of your choice (e.g. a photo from last vacation) at a place (or several) of your choice.
* memorize a simple passwd.
* construct your privkey as sha256(sha256(file)||passwd)
Nobody will guess that THIS file is the key to your btc privkey, AND will also know your passwd on top.
*Edit: Even better: Instead of a computer file you can use a Bitcoin private key (unencrypted!!) with a few mBTC. This serves as a "bait" in case you get violently robbed, and also as a warning mechanism: you observe the balance of the address of the "plain" privkey (w/o concatenated passwd), and if it is spent, you know someone stole it. Probably this someone won't try to brute-force the "hidden" key*
    sha256(plain_privkey||passwd)
*because he has no idea that it even exists, but just in case you may spend your hidden bitcoins to a new, safe, address of the same kind.*

The entities to be trusted do not need to be miners - in fact it's completely orthogonal to mining. It's more like: Person X operates a normal Bitcoin node (doesn't need to be a miner). If it detects what it thinks is a 51% attack or selfish mining attack (e.g. because a longer chain is published 5 minutes after the last common block was mined - so obviously someone mined multiple blocks in secret), it will broadcast to the network that it judges this chain invalid and rejects it. Person Y and Z do the same. All persons sign their "rejection message" with their privkey. Each individual honest miner can determine whom he trusts and will not mine blocks on chains rejected by a majority of trusted surveillance nodes. Persons XYZ can be e.g. Gavin A., Andreas A., Peter W., Mr. Slush, Mark C. or whoever. As a result, any 51% attacker just won't get his block acceppted (unless he collaborates with a majority of maybe 100 or so respected individuals of the Bitcoin community), so he would mine in a "parallel universe" not affecting the commonly accepted "official" blockchain.

Best example of conspiracy theory: you collect arguments in support of the theory, however irrelevant they may appear, and disregard any argument against the theory.

Yes, of course it does! E.g., if a lawyer uses new blockchain technology to craft a contract, that is absolutely a technical tool in my definition of the term - and this is an absolute no-brainer for me, so I am very surprised that you do not see this, since your company is claiming to do exactly this.


Sure. I never claimed so. But: To use a piece of paper when crafting a contract on it, I should understand the "paper &amp; ink" technology sufficiently well to avoid being fooled by this technology! For example if the contract is partly crafted or signed with "magic ink" (which disappears after a day or so), I could get fooled. So, IF I AM WISE, I *SHOULD* be concerned not only with the legal aspects, but equally well with the "technological" aspects of the "tool" that is used to craft the contract!
The same holds, even more so, if the "technology" to craft contracts is no "paper &amp; ink", but "blockchain" technology! I would be utmost naive if I did not understand the technology but still made the contract, relying on the blind believe that the counterparty of the contract, who does understand the technology, uses it in a fair way and does not trick me.
Words of logic, common sense and wisdom, my friend!


...except that the wisdom is invisible in your words.


No, you have not answered many questions. Apparently, either you did not understand or you did not want to understand my questions. But that is also an answer for me in a way, so now I have enough information for my own judgment, and I know what I should (not) do.


Right! Should I? Remember this is not r/Finance, so it is natural that people are asking you question relating to the TECHNOLOGY of how you build your contracts into the blockchain. And you have not given any hint here, just foggy and even contradicting/illogical/obviously wrong information (like making contracts of 1 minute duration while block generation is 10 min average, or denying that THEORETICALLY Veritaseum could technically inject false financial data into the outcomes of the contract, because bitcoin blockchain as such does not know about financial data, this information is inserted by the central point of Veritaseum).

I don't think this is going to happen.
The main reason people today individually decide to store money at the banks instead of hoarding cash underneath their mattress is that they are afraid of physical loss or theft. So they prefer to have a claim against the bank for this money.

Not necessarily. If you inject (i.e. broadcast) two competing transactions from the same privkey into the Bitcoin network with two different Bitcoin nodes, there is a 50% chance for each of them to be included in the final blockchain. You don't need any hashing power at all to run this attack.
However, such attack would be visible *if* observing the Bitcoin network. That's e.g. what Mycelium does for its buy/sell feature: The user sees if a transaction is "ok" (e.g. with no such double spending attack observed) even before a confirmation.

So if the user base increases by a factor N while the amount of bitcoin remains about constant, then the value of bitcoin should not increase by N but increase exponentially by a factor of x^N (x&gt;1) ? Interesting new theory. What should "x" be then, and why?
I am afraid you are applying Metcalfe's law to the wrong thing, Mr. Maths. Throwing around with complicated mathematical laws is one thing, but applying them where they are applicaple (and refraining from doing so when they are not!) is another thing.

Wrong question. Even if 90% of miners agree, it wouldn't be bitcoin any more. It would be a fork. The true bitcoin would be the blockchain that the remaining 10% of miners would work on - the blockchain that abides by the rules of the bitcoin protocol.
Likewise, it would be irrelevant if 90% of miners agreed to raise the blockreward from 25 to 35 bitcoins, or to reduce block time from 10 to 2 minutes... they can decide what they want - it's not the bitcoin any more then.

Good question. The answer is, because I want to keep Bitcoin's core characteristics as much as possible. The 2nd (surveillance) layer is just an "insurance". It tells potential 51%/selfish-mining attackers:
*"Don't even try, you won't succeed anyway because we won't accept your blocks, and you know that because you know the trust-based defense mechanisms we put in place."*
As a result, it will turn out that no attack occurs and everything works smoothly exactly the same way it did before.
It's a defense mechanism/insurance that is there to never be used (but should it be necessary, it will be used and will be effective).

~~If I understand correctly, you have an address at mycelium that received a bitcoin transaction some days ago acc. to~~
* ~~blockr.io~~
* ~~blockexplorer.com~~
* ~~blockchain.info~~
~~But acc. to your Mycelium app the payment has not yet arrived.~~
~~In this case I suppose your mycelium app cannot properly connect to the mycelium servers, or there's a bug with the Mycelium app. I propose you contact the mycelium developers, and tell them the receiving address in question.~~
EDIT: Sorry, I read your reply too quickly! Actually you say all the blockexplorers say "*un*confirmed"!
So what Mycelium displays is right. It seems like your wallet at blockchain.info is to blame. It sounds like the chosen transaction fee was too low. How much was it? (You can see the tx fee of the unconfirmed transaction in the blockexplorers mentioned above.)
Or the amount transferred was too low (such that it is considered "dust" and not included in the blocks by the miners). In either case, the blockchain.info wallet shouldn't have allowed you to do such a non-standard transaction.
You may have to contact blockchain.info's support for more explanations.
In any case - if the transaction remains unconfirmed for a longer time, it should eventually get deleted from the memory pool some time (no idea how long) and you will be able to access it again at your blockchain.info wallet.

...and as the difficulty goes down, selfish mining and 51% attacks become more likely as before.
When you say "the protocol decides" who is that abstract "protocol"? It is the miners themselves! So you have to introduce a "voting mechanism" because otherwise one third of the miners will randomly decide for block A, B or C, and you have designed a systematic forking (by factor 3 for each new block) into your Bitcoin protocol.
But if you introduce voting, you are prone to sybil attacks, which opens up the door for a new attack vector that is much easier than the original 51% attack.

The paper says that any coin's blockchain can be the master chain, and for the sake of simplicity the paper is assuming that Bitcoin is the master cain.
To your question: The answer is a clear "no", because none of the crypto-coins that exist today can become a sidecain of another chain. That is not possible by definition of what a sidechain is! A sidechain is a NEW blockchain that starts with zero coins in circulation on its chain, and sidecoins only come into existence by being "transferred" into the sidechain's universe from its master chain's universe.
Hence, any blockchain that already exists today and is operational can never become a sidechain of another coin.

Not possible the way you like, because handing over privkeys is like handing over a key-combination (password) for a safe that contain some money.
The only practical way to get rid of it is: both your friend and you open a coinbase wallet. Then any bitcoin transfer between them are off-blockchain and hence exclude any bitcoin network tx fees.
Disadvantage: You don't control your coins, coinbase may embezzle your funds or get hacked at any time, so only put small amounts of btc into your coinbase wallet, typically not more than what you would put into your physical wallet into the back pocket of your trousers.

In both cases, one party can broadcast an older version (the blockchain does not know the value of the latest sequence number until it hits the blockchain).

**Proper way how Bitcoin Wallet Software should avoid Dust:**
I suspect you suffered the following **"dust" problem** (note "dust" is about too small TX *out*puts, not inputs), and **a properly programmed Bitcoin wallet SW should always avoid it** *(blockchain.info wallet apparently doesn't)* :
I'll explain with a simple example:
Assumme your wallet has 3 addresses with balances of
A = 0.00000008 BTC
B = 3.00010000 BTC
C = 4.00000541 BTC
Assume you want to send 7 BTC to address Z, and you set tx fee = 0.0001 BTC.
IF your wallet makes what "looks" straight forward (I suspect this is current bad (!) "blockchain.info/wallet" implementation), you gonna end up in your mess:
- TX Input = B + C = 7.00010541
- TX fee = 0.00010000 BTC
- TX Output 1 = Z = 7.00000000 BTC
- TX Output 2 = D = 0.00000541 BTC (the change) &lt;--- **DUST**
(Note that this looks the same to the network as if you sent 0.00000541 BTC to someone and 7 BTC is your change)
There are two (three) ways how a properly programmed wallet can avoid it:
Solution 1:
- TX Input = **A +** B + C = 7.00010549
- TX fee = 0.00010000 BTC
- TX Output 1 = Z = 7.00000000 BTC
- TX Output 2 = D = 0.00000549 BTC (the change) &lt;--- No dust ! (it is &gt;=546 satoshis!)
 
 
Solution 2 (if you don't have the address A in your wallet):
- TX Input = B + C = 7.00010541
- TX fee = **0.00010541** BTC
- TX Output 1 = Z = 7.00000000 BTC
- TX Output 2 = doesn't exist (no change, no dust)
 
 
Solution 3 (not recommended but better than original):
- TX Input = B + C = 7.00010541
- TX fee = 0.00009995 BTC (slightly reduced fee)
- TX Output 1 = Z = 7.00000000 BTC
- TX Output 2 = D = 0.00000546 BTC (the change) &lt;--- No dust ! (it is &gt;=546 satoshis!)
Note that solution 3 has a smaller tx fee than default, but I think(!) this will just get it de-prioritized by the miners and not rejected from the memory pool straight away. So you would wait a few more blocks for the first confirmation, but not hours. When choosing between solution 2 and 3 (if sol. 1 is not possible), the wallet app should default to sol. 2, but in an expert mode could also offer sol. 3.
***Please write to blockchain.info, point them to this post, and ask them to implement this properly (as outlined here) to avoid unnecessary annoyance in user experience (and the unnecessary impression that Bitcoin does not yet work smoothly) for the future.***
The solution should be like "solution 1", if possible, and otherwise "solution 2" (which is always(!!) possible), or alternatively solution 3, instead of 2, for advanced users.
The "solution 2" entails a very slightly (but well acceptable) increased Tx fee.
 
 
PS: To avoid the side effect of slightly increase tx fees for avoiding dust (sol.2) (max. increase by 5.45%), I'd recommend making sol.3 the default, but this would require changing miner policy such that it is *guaranteed* that miners will not discard a transaction as long as a tx meets the following condition:
(a) either tx_fee &gt;= 0.00010000 BTC (or whatever tx_fee_min is in a particular situation)
(b) or tx_fee + smallest_tx_output &gt; 0.0001000 BTC AND smallest_tx_output==0.00000546 BTC.
In this case, in the worst case the network would accept a fee reduction by 0.00000545 BTC, e.g. from 0.00010000 to 0.00009455 BTC or a reduction of at most 5.45% for particular (rare) transactions. But this is something where the core devs have to get involved.
*Edit: I think you, the reader, can disregard solution 3 and all I wrote about it. It is just one FURTHER thought that probably distracts from the main thought. So just consider solutions 1 and 2, and that's it.*

I had some (vanity) addresses in mind of which I remembered the firstbits. When I wanted to know the balance or latest activities out of curiosity, I could simply go to any internet PC, enter the firstbits at blockchain.info and look up the balance. That was just convenient. That's the whole reason I was wondering whether some website still supports it.
I understand the adverse effects of firstbits and also the dangers if used incorrectly. But knowing that we are living in a (partly) free world, everybody is free to run a web server that offers this service, and the blockchain will have to be able to deal with it, like it or not.
I have the impression that some people who (correctly) know the disadvantages of firstbits try to enforce the world-wide "ban" of firstbits by coercion, by downvoting a reddit question that even mentions it. This is 100% against the spirit of free Bitcoin, and it reminds me of the mindset of the early communists trying to coerce a better world (which obviously failed due to its inherent self-contradiction).

Since government apparently supports the "bitdrop" actively, maybe it's not unrealistic to assume that government will accept tax or other payments in bitcoin mid term.

And if Dominican government is smart, they collect a few BTC before they make the announcement to accept BTC for official purposes.

I am not sure I understand what you mean...


When you say "longer fraud chain" I assume you are referring to a chain of blocks that is mined in secret and is published at a later point in time. If it is longer than the chain publicly known by then, it will revert many blocks of that up-to-now public chain, down to that common "parent block". This current parent block was mined many minutes or even hours or days ago, which is much longer than the Bitcoin network propagation time (= a few seconds). So it will be in fact very easy to detect this kind of fraud.


You mean a miner does not include the "normal" transactions, but just dummy transactions, or no transactions at all, in its block? Well, then this would result in a situation where n% of the blocks are useless crap, n being the percentage of the attacker's mining power. This would bloat the blockchain and reduce the Bitcoin capacity (tx/sec). This is another kind of attack (kind of DoS). I was not thinking of this kind originally, but actually such blocks could also be detected by the surveillance nodes by comparing their own memory pool of transactions with the transactions included in the block broadcasted by the attacker. If there is too much mismatch, the trusted surveillance nodes would broadcast a corresponding message to the network.

Interesting. If they do not disclose their identities in the imprint section of their web site, they cannot be trusted, that's for sure. Remember that many respectable people in the bitcoin community give their names to complete strangers (i.e. to the open public), e.g. the bitcoin devs, or mike C. alias Casascius, the CEOs of various companies etc. Even Mark K. from MtGox was publically known and still he could not be trusted as we know today, so even less so could we trust an anonymous group (allegedly!) that runs a web site and collects funds from users for some bets.

Not really. If the chain stays at difficulty one it means mining speed was 10 min per block ever sincr on this chain, because otherwise the dfficulty would have been adjusted upwards. So a difficulty-one-chain (or lower difficulty-chain more generally) must have LESS blocks than the actual block chain, unless it has blocks with time stamps far in the future.

I want to believe you.
But Mt Gox Price was leading against all other exchanges and pulled tbe price up everywhere. Plus the reports about Willy Bot seem quite plausible to me.
Plus the steady price decline since "end of willybot", heading towards pre-Nov2013 levels.
All this is evidence enough for me. I expect price levels below 200$ within the next 12 months, possibly "double digit" even. Of course I hope I am completely wrong.

The conclusion that cryptocurrency is inevitable in the given scenario is flawed.

Well said. The problem is: It is easy to define new rules that sound good. But in Bitcoin there is no central authority that can enforce that everybody abides by these rules, because Bitcoin is decentralized and trustless. So whenever suggesting new rules, one has to check if these rules can be realized under the given constraints. For example, the rule "no two successive blocks by the same miner" shows that the originating poster lacks some fundamental understanding. But indeed many people make the same sort of mistake when suggesting "improvements" to the protocol, for the same lack of understanding.
That's natural, no worries. The only thing I am expecting from these newbies is to not be arrogant, to not self-defend their own hopeless position but to question their own position and to be able to learn.

No trend change - just a technical counter reaction against too fast price decline.
Overall price decline trend still intact. To change trend price needs to break 500 usd/btc in a sustainable manner.

Sure that would be possible. But this is an *additional* modification to the one the OP proposed, and a major one, because it means "good bye" to the principles of a TRUSTLESS system. Because you have to trust *someone* (be it the majority, be it some selected well-connected nodes with good reputation in the community etc.). In case you trust the "majority" you would be prone to sybil attacks (an attacker takes on multiple identities (e.g. IP addresses), which is why Bitcoin was designed for PoW rather than majority decision.
So it is not that easy. All I want to say is that every solution comes with some unwanted side effect.
Unfortunately, the solution of the OP doesn't work unless you add another mofification that means "bye" to the 100% trustless system.
Edit: having said all this, it might still be worthwhile thinking about such kind of enhancements. Having a "lower layer" of the bitcoin network that operates on the known *trustless* principles, plus an additional trusted layer (be it majority-based, trusted node based or alike) on-top that "controls" against misuse by strong pools creating long orphans after having mined secretly (you can do this already with much less than 51%) might indeed be the "golden" solution where we are heading mid/long term.

First: My critisism is against these laws, and by no means against the american people (just to be clear).
Secondly: Which european laws are you referring to exactly? I am not aware of such laws, but every european country has different laws. As to gun laws: Like most Europeans, I am absolutely in favor of very strict gun laws. But I know that this does not reflect the majority opinion of the "Bitcoiners". It's certainly a cultural thing. Owning guns is completely unimportant in european society in most countries, whereas in US it has long history and is perceived as a freedom right. We have to respect these different cultural views (btw, NY has also strict gun laws maybe even stricter than some european countries, I heard...). In Germany e.g. the freedom of "no speed limit" on the motorways is perceived as an important freedom right for many (most?) people (me included), which is vigorously restricted in US even on big&amp;wide motorways in the desert, which a German can hardly understand. So I think we have to respect certain cultural differences in the definition of "freedom"...

A cash bill (monetary base) is what the central bank lended to a private bank (for interest). So even also "M0" is debt.
Nevertheless, some exceptions: In Germany, in the 1940ies, the German central bank distributed 13 Billion DM (ca. 6.5 Bill. €) as no debt. Probably by now this amount is offset by burned/lost/forgotten cash notes, and is fully negligible compared to money supply (M0, M1, M1, M3), so practically even for this example it is valid to say each single Euro of cash is mirrored by at least one EUR of debt.

I don't want to do you any bad, I just want to understand.
Maybe my question was not clear. The video and the pdf did not answer my question. I am not yet interested, at this point, in how I should operate the GUI and where to click in the GUI.
My question (and I think also 88's question) is much more fundamental, about how Ultra-Coin works under the hood *in principle*.
Some of my question may appear trivial to you, others challenging. For me, all my questions are honest questions.
I think it would be best explained by an example. I will make one CONCRETE example here:
I have 1 BTC that I want to use to bet on Apple share vs. USD. I want to go long in Apple, for a 1 month duration.
At the moment there is no matching offer, so I submit my offer now (1:00 pm). NOW apple share is worth exactly 100usd/share (Q.: which stock market is used as the basis by Veritaseum?)
The first match (0.5 Btc) is filled at 1:10 pm, when apple share is 102 usd.
The second match (0.5 btc) is filled at 1:25pm, when apple share is 99 usd.
After 10 days, apple share grows to 350 usd. Again 10 days later (=filling date+20d) apple share is only 25 usd) [I am assuming a wild ride for the sake of illustration].
Finally, after 1 month the trade expires, now apple share is at 100.5 USD.
Q.: How many bitcoins do I have now (after fees to ultracoin), and how is the exact calculation? Does it depend on how the BTC/USD xch-rate has changed during the last month in this example? (If yes, why and how?)
Q: who inputs the data about the stock market exchange rates, on a per minute or per second basis, into the blockchain? An automated computer at Veritaseum? Which stock market's data are taken for this?
Q: At the moment I fill the contract, do I (i.e. my ultracoin wallet client) send my BTCs to a btc address that is controlled by Veritaseum company?
Q.: Is it technically possible that Veritaseum fills my open order on the other side of the trade and then manipulates the system in a way pretending that the value of the underlying of my trade has changed against my bet? (even if in fact it didn't). If no, how in the world can this technically(!) not be possible? If yes, obviously I *do* have to trust Ultracoin that they don't embezzle my bitcoins that are in my orders, right?

The idea is that 1 sidechain coin == 1 bitcoin, and you can transfer coins from bitcoin to sidechain and back. So new alt coins with their own blockchains and features can be created WITHOUT inflating the monetary base of cryptocoins, and with a 100% fixed exchange rate between bitcoin and sidechain coin.

1) Brute forcing a bip38 password takes MUCH longer than bruteforcing a brainwallet with the same password, as kinoshitajona has explained very nicely.
2) somebody can try brute forcing your brainwallet right away, even before you have actually created your brainwallet! Indeed, it may already be "hacked" before you send your first coins there!
On the other hand, your bip38 paper wallet can only be bruteforced if someone gets hold of your bip38 backup. Plus, even then it is much slower (see 1).

Q: How thick is one bitcoin?
A: 20 yards.
Q: Why?
A: Because if you stack 21 Mill bitcoins on top of each other, you get a column of height 384400 km. This is the distance earth-moon.
Q: But then a mBTC is still 1.83 cm thick. This is very thick for a coin, isn't it?
A: Yes, 8.3 times thicker than a Euro coin.
Q: So the intrinsic value of a mBTC is 8.3 € = $11.40?
A: Sure!  ;-)

So then tell me: by which mechanism do you intend to fix price at 500 usd/btc? Let's assume demand soars and suddenly there are 50 Million people in the world all of which want to buy one btc for 500 usd.
But there are only max. 21 Million bitcoins ever in existence. So guaranteeing the price is IMPOSSIBLE, *unless* you change the fundamental nature of bitcoin and allow more than 21 Mill. BTC to be issued.

Definitely the second. Although I understand your point, I think you are missing a point. Let me ask a question back:
What do you think will happen to the bitcoin price if someone proves the existence of the privkey of the 2nd address (e.g. by spending from it on the blockchain)? Nothing!
And what will happen if the blockchain shows a spending from the first address? BTC price will drop to near zero, because this would indicate to most people (incl. myself and all people with a clear mind) that most likely (with astronomically high probability) Bitcoin hash function was broken!
Similarly, the lottery numbers (4, 23, 28, 30, 39, 44) and (1,2,3,4,5,6) are equally likely to occur. Nevertheless, everybody who fills a lottery ticket with the second sequence is naive. Because if he wins, he won't win but a few dollars maximum.

The idea is: My "normal" wallet's address of my smartphone wallet app is, as today, "1normaL". If my phone gets stolen or someone points a gun at me, the bitcoins on this address are lost. That's why one should only have pocket money on that address. But now I go on a longer vacation abroad, take my phone with me, and want to take say 5000 usd in bitcoin with me. But not on the "normal" address. Normal "brainwallet" is prone to dictionary attacks or alike unless my passphrase is VERY strong, so this is also not an option.
So the solution is that I need to memorize one (or many different) relatively simple password, and the wallet app calculates the temporary privkey (which is only kept on memory and never on flash) by "sha256(concatenation of 'normal' privkey and my password)". Once I have "unlocked" (or "activated") this key, I can spend from it to any address (e.g. to reload my "1normaL", or spend directly to another destination address). Then the key disappears again from memory (after gui command or timeout) and leaves no trace on my phone.
There is no way anybody who gets hold of my phone's priv key (e.g. via a gun) can know if there are hidden keys in existence calculated via this method sha256(privkey,passwd) at all, and if yes how many. So this method is very discrete, safe and easy in managing hidden bitcoin priv keys.

So my understanding is (please confirm or correct):
1) A shop selling some goods *can* accept bitcoins as long as the price tags are in UAH? I.e. if someone pays, (s)he can pay either directly in UAH or the equivalent amount (acc. to UAH price tag) in BTC, right?
2) Trading UAH for bitcoins and vice versa is allowed, right?
3) The central bank in the Ukraine has no constitutional power to say what is forbidden and what is not. This is the job of the elected parliament. So the central bank's announcement is rather a reminder of the current state of the law, right?

So it *is* possible that Veritaseum's computers embezzle the user's funds bound in a contract (if the computers are manipulated), but such fraud would be publicly visible to the world. I don't know why you say it can't be possible. It makes one think you want to hide something, and hiding the obvious cannot build trust.
Now, is there a documentation about how Veritaseum uses the blockchain, such that everybody can check it? Give a reference to such documentation, please [if it doesn't exist, any promise is not worth anything]. (I am wondering how the contracts are technically inserted into the Bitcoin blockchain - maybe certain code is inserted into some parts of the transaction strings in the blocks of the blockchain...)
What is also completly unclear: How can contracts take 1 minute, if the average (!) block time in bitcoin takes 10 minutes? It means that not a single bitcoin block is mined between filling and expiry of a contract. So your claim that you use the blockchain cannot be true! So I understand very well that many people consider Ultra-Coin/Veritaseum a scam and many claims lies! If you have answers, why is all the links that you offer only superficial talk and no hard facts and technical info? I for my part am VERY critical, to say it diplomatically.

I think what user 88 (=sqrt7744) had in mind when asking for an EXAMPLE was more something like this:
Please explain how a contract is done with the example that user A bets that bitcoin price decreases within the next  100 days, and user A wants to ensure himself against losses for his 10 BTC up to BTC falling to 50% of its current value, vs. USD. How is this done? Who is the counter party? Whom does user A need to trust? What happens if Ultracoin goes bankrupt after 50 days? Can Ultracoin embezzle user A's bitcoins?
How is the situation if the deal is not about BTC/USD but about the oil price in USD?
At least *I* would like to know in all detail how this is technically realized, before I would spend a single penny.
If the whole thing is legit (which I assume it is), I expect to find answers to these questions. Hope I won't get proven wrong.

Any physical sensor could be used, like camera, mic, magnetic sensor, accelerometer (of a smartphone).
The principle idea (explained taking the example of the microphone):
There is always some noise around, so let the mic sample the surrounding audio signal. Then, of each 100th sample (e.g. "100", such that 100 samples &gt; coherence time) only look at the LSB of the sample, but only consider samples that have at least an amplitude of [4] bit. We can assume that any integer audio sample of magnitude &gt;=16 has equal probability that it is odd (LSB=1) or even (LSB=0). So ready is your physical RNG, eligible for privkey generation.
If you still don't fully trust this method, apply this principle to multiple sensors. E.g. generate independent random bit sequences of length 256 using (a) the mic, (b) the front camera, (c) the back camera, (d) the magnetic sensor, (e) the accelerometer and (f) the mouse movement or screen input. Then calculate the final 256 bit sequence by XOR-ing all sequences. For the end result to be fully random it is sufficient if ONE of these sequences is fully random and uncorrelated to all other sequences. This is obviously the case. Even if all sequences are of bad quality exept one, your resulting random sequence is perfect.

In that case people (i.e. everyone except the attacker) would reject the new fork of the blockchain. As a next step a net of trust could be incorporated in the mining software to filter out (reject) blockchain forks that are judged 51% attacks (i.e. a surveillance mechanism as a layer on top of the current mining layer). This would change Bitcoin's strict paradigm of a trustless system, but it would keep Bitcoin being practically usable. It would add a social human component to Bitcoin - only well respected members of the community would be incorporated in the net of trust by the miners, and Bitcoin would be safer than ever. Every trusted partner would have one voice in the surveillance vote, and since selection is by social not mathematical criteria, sybil attacks can be practically excluded.
If I were a bitcoin dev, I would have this sw in my drawer to pull it out immediately if a massive 51% attack occured. But I would not talk about it publicly in advance to not worry the Bitcoin community.

Oh, in my last post I missed to answer precisely your question:




No, this wouldn't work as long as Bitcoin remains a TRUSTLESS system.
Prove: Assume that this protocol extension is built-in to the Bitcoin SW. Now you start up your Bitcoin SW from scratch, it connects to other nodes and downloads the blockchain. At this moment the attack mentioned occurs. Since I am in the process of downloading the blockchain just now, there is no "my chain" already there, and the rule you describe could not identify the malicious 51% chain as malicious and would accept it.
Tl;dr: So you would need some sort of trusted nodes for this to work, as I outlined on my previous reply. Alone coding this rule into the SW is not sufficient.

I am not wondering why. Actually it's quite evident.
The fundamentals, the real-world use of Bitcoin, *has* increased continuously since beginning 2013. But the price has increased much faster than that, in observation of this very trend and in speculative expectation of further rise of fundamentals, and fired by two major events (1.=Cyprus, 2.=China hype+MtGox/WillyBot).
So price has lost "attachment" to fundamentals. What we observe now is that this gap between price and fundamentals is closing again, the 2013's bubble fuel has burned out, so the bitcoin ~~rocket~~ plane is sailing back towards its (still rising) fundamental price level.
Where is this fundamental price level? Hard to tell, but if we had not had the Cyprus price ignition and the China hype supported by MtGox' artificial market, we'd probably be in the +/- 100 usd range now at most (even if assuming that fundamentals have risen by factor 10 since beg. 2013), so there is still a lot of downward price potential, because the gap is still too big.
Long term, fundamental use can be expected to continue growing, and once price is back at levels with moderate "speculative premium", new bubbles with new alltime-highs can be expected. Maybe not before 2016. Maybe earlier, depd. on geopolitical events.

No matter how many percent work on a new fork, it's still a fork. No matter what part of the protocol is changed (max. Blocksize limit, 21 Mill. limit, or whatever) - if the chage makes it incompatible, it's a fork.
In this case (raise max.blocksize) there are many players in the community who are against it. It would be "interesting" to see what would happen. Maybe a processor like coinbase will not accept the fork (there are many reasons against raising max.blocksize limit, discussed exhaustively e.g. on bitcointalk), and a "forked btc foundation/group of devs" could maintain the code following the original Bitcoin protocol. As a result, there would be two blockchains from this moment on. Both bitcoins would develop their own usd/btc exchange rate, and overaul trust in bitcoin will send prices down because of the confusion.
So it's not that easy just to raise block limit and should not be done carelessly.


Offline (edit: correction: I mean "off-blockchain") processing would be a solution by which current blocksize may be sufficient long-term, even if transaction per second increase a lot. Payment processors, online-wallet providers and regulators might favour an evolution in this direction.
Concerning block rewards: In any case, at some point in future, block rewards decrease due to halving (guess you are not questioning the 21 Mill limit), so mining hashrate will adapt, non-profitable miners switch off, the system is self-regulating, no problem. If mining hashrate decreases so much that 51% attacks become realistic, new defense machanisms should get in place (discussed elsewhere). But this is some time in the future. Dogecoin will reach this point much earlier and will act as a nice test-baloon to test suitable mechanisms.

Thanks for the explanation, dskloet, I am repetitively honestly delighted by your posts! Now also I understand how to combine "nLockTime" feature of a transaction with multisig feature, such that bitcoins aren't spendable before a specified time, and also to avoid that the bitcoins are "double-spent" before "nLockTime" is reached, so the recipient does not need to trust the sender.
Nevertheless... I (and the OP as well I guess) was assuming that this can also be achieved with a single transaction (without multisig) using "Pay-to-ScriptHash" (compare ch. 4.3.3 of " The question is whether {serializedScript} can somehow specify a condition like "current BlockDepth or UnixTime &gt; XYZ". The advantage would be that the transaction is in the blockchain immediately and does not need to be kept in the memory pool (or in the receiver's wallet) until nLockTime is reached. A disadvantage would be that the recipient would need to keep the exact {serializedScript} that matches &lt;scriptHash&gt; exactly, to be able to spend the received coins.

I agree 100 usd at mid 2013 could be fair just as 10 usd beg. of 2013 could be.
Now if 100 is "right", the recent price drop is a bit unexplainable and "unfair" or an over-reaction/exaggeration as many think (maybe also the OP).
If 10 is "right", the recent price drop is just a normal correction.
I am not saying whether 10 or 100 or any number is right or wrong. I am just saying that it is WELL POSSIBLE (and not necessarily something one has to wonder about) that the 2014's price decline despite continuous user adoption is absolutely within the realm of a very normal and unspectacular price correction after a phase of exaggerated expectation/bubble. So the widely seen notion amongst many people (acc. to my personal perception) that the recent price decline is "unfair" and "too much now" is not necessarily the only view that one can have. One can also view it as a normal correction. Personally, I consider it such and personally I expect the price to hit clearly below 200. I am making this viewpoint to show that there can be other viewpoints than the one of an "overreaction towards too low prices", and that my viewpoint is by no means less reasonable than the other.
Now everybody can decide for oneself what to think - I was just offering an explanation that the OP was asking for.

Buy a bitcoin at coinbase. Once done, transfer it to your offline wallet's address. For a very safe offline wallet and a very secure way to generate and store a private key, with minimum IT knowledge, do this:
* re-activate your *old* android smartphone that you don't use any more for a while.
* Install "bitcoin address tool" and "mycelium" on that phone from google play.
* now go offline FOREVER with this phone.
* open "bitcoin address tool" and enter a sequence of 100 numbers 1-6 in the field "passphrase", where you toss these numbers with a *real physical* die.
* press generate
* tap the field "private key (WIF)" and copy that key to clipboard
* start mycelium
* import the private key from clipboard.
* make a backup with mycelium, this generates a pdf file. You need to get this pdf file out of this phone (e.g. by external uSD card) and print it out. You also need to write down a few letters during backup, the app guides you the way.
* verify with mycelium that the backup works, the app guides you the way for this.
* now send the bitcoin from coinbase to the bitcoin address that corresponds to your just generated private key.
* Later, if you want to spend your bitcoin, install mycelium on your currently used android phone and select menu button -&gt; spend from cold storage and scan the private key's QR code from your offline phone. In the offline phone's mycelium app go to Keys-&gt;Export to display the scannable priv key's QR code.

Of course, not all shady endavours end up as scams, but history tells that it is very very likely that it does, and that their users will eventually loose their funds, be it due to fraud or due to lack of competence.

Great news!
Q.: is the random seed generated with a secure random data generator? My question is rethorical, I assume the answer is "not quite".
I propose you generate the random data not only by calculating pseudo random numbers (any such algo could turn out faulty in the future). Instead I propose to utilize the many PHYSICAL sensors of a smartphone to generate truely (physically) random data. Compare truecrypt: here the user has to make random mouse movements (physical randomness) to generate random seeds. For good reason they did not trust calculation of random numbers.
For a smartphone, random inputs can be random calculation, touchscreen, gyroscope, magnetic sensor, accelerometer, mic, cam, each generating a random bit sequence. Then you xor all these sequences. As long as at least one of these sequences is truely random, the overall sequence is truely random.

The attackers won't succeed against vertcoin, they would just burn their own money. Vertcoin's agenda is to change the mining algo as soon as it turns out that current algo is not dezentralized enough. I.e. after a 51% attack they would for sure distribute a new SW that checkpoints the last valid block and changes the mining algo after that, such that the hardware investment of the attacker becomes worthless. The vertcoin community knows that and can have peace of mind. The attacker cannot win this cat-and-mouse game.
Bitcoin can do the same if necessary (or choose other mechanisms as discussed elsewhere in this thread)
However you turn it, when thinking it through we always end up understanding that the attacker cannot win long term, because the target is not just a dumb algorithm, but people (developers, community) that can decide to take measures to work around the attack and keep the system going.

@_date: 2014-09-13 13:56:58
Another reason is this:
If we give a commitee of say 50 respected community members the power of mining blocks directly, an attacker just has to target these people (social engineering/pressure/threatening/...) to attack the coin.
If we implement it the way I described, the attacker must do this as well, PLUS must have substantial mining power, so the attack would be more difficult.
Moreover, with the "direct mining by the commitee" approach everybody must agree on the same 50 members, and the 50 members must *collaborate actively* to mine each single block together.
In contrast, with the "surveillance method" the coupling of the controlling entities is completely loose, nobody has to collaborate actively or passively with anybody else. Instead, every person in the world can announce that he/she is running a surveillance node, publish his ctiteria/policy for block rejection and the public key, and his ID and other personal info (*if he wants*), and all miners and Bitcoin users can decide on their own which set of surveillance nodes they trust. If some surveillance nodes go offline this doesn't affect the system as a whole. The whole setup is still pretty much decentralized and loosely coupled. If a surveillance node repetitively makes decisions in contradiction to my own node's judgment (my own bitcoin node is also a surveillance node whom I trust by default) I would de-list it from my set of trusted surveillence nodes. Ideally, the surveillance and block rejection default criteria would be included in Bitcoin reference implementation, as well as criteria for de-listing surveillance nodes from the trusted list, and notions for weak and strong block rejection (weighting functions) would be included to avoid permanent blockchain forking due to weak criteria.

The number of bitcoins in existence can be *exactly* derived from the number of blocks. If they use another "calculation method" it means they use another method of counting blocks...
Edit: Maybe they are reloading the blockchain from the start for some reason (e.g. after a disk crash) and have not yet finished, so the nb. of bitcoins indicates where they are in this process...
Edit 2: No, this theory is proven wrong. Just now the number of bitcoins in existence have DEcreased again from &gt;10 Mill to only 9.5 Mill. Strange...

Here's my differentiated view on this:
There are methods how a recipient of a payment can be 99.9% sure even before the first confirmation. The Mycelium local trader has implemented this for example.
Nevertheless, there are use cases where one confirmation is required, and reducing block time from 10 to 5 or 2 minutes would somewhat improve (albeit not completely solve) this.
So generally, considering a moderate reduction of block time could be worth considering. But the limits have to be respected:
The condition
    Block time &gt;&gt; network propagation time
must be fulfilled to avoid too much orphaning.
Now, one argument came to my mind that suggests to me that the current 10min choice might be not so bad after all: There is a certain risk that internet might be censored to block the Bitcoin protocol. This is why there are some projects to bypass the internet, e.g. via small dedicated satellites. Another method could be the use of self-organizing adhoc peer to peer networks that propagate information via multiple hops and cannot be censored. With these methods transport delay and Bitcoin propagation times will increase significantly. And then, block times &lt; 10 min would just cause too many orphans, taking this option of censorship prevention away from Bitcoin. So if we want to keep this as a serious option, it seems to me we should better not reduce the 10min blocktime.

Thanks for the hint - upvote for you. I thought they are at least slightly encrypted by the PIN in Mycelium. I am a little disappointed by Mycelium now about why they did not at least include such minimum protection mechanism. (I agree it would be easy to crack for a 6 digit PIN, but they should support password instead of PIN).
I also think Mycelium (or another wallet) should support plausibly deniable hybrid-priv-key-brainwallets like this:
Save priv key on phone, allow to generate another priv key by sha256(privKeyOnPhone+yourPassword) and be able to spend from it. "yourPassword" is never saved on the phone's flash mem.
This feature would also allow theft detection. You can have as many brainwallets as you like to concatenate with the privkey on your phone's flash mem.

Ok, I understand. But taking randomness from user input on the screen (again: compare truecrypt when generating a new encrypted volumne) does not require more permissions. And it can only improve and cannot possibly worsen the quality of randomness, when XOR-ing that bit sequence with the /dev/urandom bit sequence.
And moreover, adding access to e.g. magnetic sensor or accelerometer will be uncritical I think. For camera or mic I understand your reluctance to add these permissions.

If this is really the outcome of this study by [Meni Rosenfeld], it is based on wrong assumptions and completely missing the point.
True is: 1 confirmation is less secure if fork rate is higher. And fork rate is MUCH higher for 1min block time than for 10 min block time because network propagation speed is not infinite.
Ex.: If fork rate is 30%, double spend attacks can be carried out with a high probability of success even if the attacker has zero(!) hashing power.
And a 50% attack requires only 41.2% (=70/(70+100) of the total hash rate, because 30% of honest miners' hashing power is wasted into calculating orphans.

Very bad idea, and contradictory in itself.
By making a selfish mining attack, the attacker is the bad guy. Secretly mining a competing chain and releasing it to the public later on, thereby making blocks invalid that have been mined legitimately before (this is how selfish mining works) is evil and wrong in itself. This doesn't change by proclaiming "but I am doing this attack for a good purpose!" That is outright ridiculous!
Also, the pool problem wouldn't be solved at all. After the attack everything starts over, so you would have to perform this selfish mining attack continuously. This means you end up with a pool that dominates everything - actually what you originally intended to prevent.

Since the card has no display, I don't know what I sign. I have to rely that my smartphone was not hacked, otherwise anything can happen.
So it is no more secure than today's wallet apps: Also here I am secure if and only if the smartphone was not hacked.
How to do it correctly: "bither" app for Android or iOS. Here, instead of a card you need a second (e.g. old) offline smartphone or iPhone.

You don't understand a hard fork.
A hard fork happens to the blockchain in the future. Everything before the hard fork is safe! Hence absolutely no need to remove the funds.
On the contrary - if anything, it's safer to not move the coins. If they are sitting in a block long before the fork, then they are valid in all forked chains.

This is trivial: Of course C, because the chain X-A-C is longer than X-B. And because A arrived before B anyway, in your example.
But you picked the wrong example and do not understand that a 51% attack means mining in secret and releasing the sub-chain many minutes delayed! The scenario to look at is this:
* time t0: Common chain X, everybody is mining on X.
* t1: Block A arrives, new chain is X-A, everybody now mining on A.
* t2: Block B arrives as X-B (your example) - it will be disregarded, because A was earlier!
* t3 = lets say t1+3min:While still mining on X-A, suddenly, Blocks X-C-D arrive. Now X-C-D is longer than X-A. So as of today, all miners would switch to X-C-D. However, the legitimate question is: Whoever mined C-D, why did he not release block "C" directly after it was mined? All the world (all honest miners) are mining on X-A since 3 min already. And after 3 min, somebody is broadcasting X-C-D to the network! This stinks! This is obviously a selfish mining or 51% attack. All honest minerst, acc. to my proposal, will identify this easily and ignore X-C-D. Even if the malicious miner now broadcasts X-C-D-E-F-etc., it will be ignored! Becaue my own miner has identified the attack and so have all my trusted noded (if they are honest), and have broadcast this alert to the network.
For the rest of your post, it seems you do not understand or want to understand that this is an enhancement proposal, but you keep saying "but this is not in the original sense of the protocol". No point in discussing like that. I can't help thinking you are a troll, and pretending not knowing what a troll is makes this even more likely. I will not reply to you any further now.

No no, the ideas are very concrete and quite simple as well. I have outlined in this thread a mechanism that realizes Andreas' suggestion in a formalized manner by protocol extension, involving elements of trust as a "surveillance layer" on top of the PoW layer (not to be confused with completely replacing PoW by net of trust!!). If formalized like that, a 51% attack would practically turn out unsuccessful (for the reasons Andreas is outlining), while the PoW core is maintained. Hence, the incentive to even TRY a 51% attack is going away and we will probably never see a serious 51% attack in the first place, so the PoW can continue to work and do its nice job, as designed.


This remark is not helpful. It reminds me of someone who is trying to polish his ego by bashing a respected member of the community. The bashes reflect back to the basher.
I think Andreas has had some deeper thoughts on this topic than all the people who are quickly bashing him here in an unreflected manner.

Effectively, if you buy a contract with Ultracoin, then Veritaseum is the counterparty, as I understand.
So in the end it is a normal trading platform for all sorts of "bets", and "ultracoin over bitcoin" is just used as a vehicle to make this contract.
In the end though, the couterparty is always sitting in the real world.

In Bitcoin, all Bitcoins are "saved" on the "blockchain", which is a big public ledger (database) of all Bitcoin transactions that have ever occurred. All &gt; 5000 bitcoin nodes in the world have an identical copy of this database. To transfer bitcoins, you need a so-called private key, this is like a passwort, to unlock the coins belonging to this private key.
A paper wallet is simply this private key (secret string) printed or written down on paper.

There exist three kinds of double spending attacks:
The first is based on a 51% attack in connection with reverting the blockchain. If an attacker has this much (&gt;50%) hashing power, no payment is safe. Not after 1, not after 6, not after 100 confirmations!
The second double-spending attack is based on an attacker who owns a substantial hashing power, but less than 50%. Let's take 10% as an example. In this case he can mine the next block with a certain probability [10%], so the probability of succes of the attack after zero confirmations is 10%. He can revert 1 confirmation with a certain probability [1%]. He can revert 2 confirmations with an even lower probability [0.1%]. Etc. So after about 6 confirmation transactions are considered pretty safe from this sort of attack.
The third kind of double-spending attack does not require any hashing power but works by injecting two competing transactions from the same address into the Bitcoin network. If the "correct" transaction has 1 confirmation, the attack was not successful. At zero confirmation, the attack success probability is ca. 50%.

When I first heard about multisig addresses I also first thought: ssss (shamir's secret sharing scheme) applied to a "normal" privkey does effectively the same.
But after a second thought I realized that this is not quite true, there's in fact a huge difference:
With ssss, in any scenario where we actually want to spend from the key, there is always one point in time when one person knows all the ssss keys. This is the moment when abuse can occur. You can only avoid it by gathering all ssss key owners *physically* together in one room in front of a PC, to let them control each other that nobody does any abuse.
With multisig, it is much easier+safer: Each multisig partial key owner signs the transaction in question, one after another, each at their location, they do not need to meet in person, and no single person could abuse at any time of the scenario.

Unlike with the fiat money system that can only survive due to the mechanism of flows of interest payments, there's no interest built into bitcoin's system design, so there's no constant money flow by design from the diligent to the rich. If someone has 1% of the bitcoins, s/he is very rich, but the 1% will not increase further by "fiscal osmosis".


The money generation is built into the bitcoin protocol, there's a simple formula, so the amount ever generated can be exactly calculated to be 20.999xyz.... million bitcoins. If some computer does not play by these rules and generates more, this violation of the rule is evident by every other computer and they wont accept his "false bitcoins".


the units mBTC and uBTC (the latter also referred to as "bits") are getting more and more popular in bitcoin wallet software and language. It is a natural evolution and logical reaction of the people. Semiconductor manufacturers use the unit "nm" (nanometers) for a similar reason - it's just more practical.
Bitcoin foundation is trying to standardize (iso 4217) bitcoin symbol XBT as 1/1000000th bitcoin (= 1 uBTC = 1 bit).


No relationship. Altcoins are mostly copies of the original bitcoin software with certain tweaks/adaptations. They also differ in their respective total coin supply limit (if any). Each altcoin is a "cryptocoin universe" of its own.

You are right that one has to think about *other* consequences. But I am sure it's not unsolvable. Do you see any such "other consequences"? Certainly one cannot avoid the 51% attack problem without introducing some elements of trust.
Note however, that does not mean that, as many say, PoW would be completely useless then. The trust element is just a supervision layer on top of the PoW core, with the intention that it is never needed or only in very rare circumstances, to dis-incentivise the bad guys to try a 51% attack in the first place. So this is completely(!) different from saying that every single block is now generated by trusted agreement rather than PoW.  COMPLETELY different. Those who say "then we do not need PoW any more" have not understood at all.

No need for yelling. Keep calm and just replace upper case characters by good explanations, that would be fully sufficient for a pragmatic discussion.
What you are describing is that all market participants using the currency of the central bank XYZ use electronic bank accounts directly controlled and maintained by that central bank (instead of private banks), so the central bank itself has a full record of all transactions between any two entities. This is what I understood so far, am I right?
Then, which *database format* the central bank uses *internally* for this, its own, central ledger, is completely unimportant. Then my question is: Why would you call *this* a BLOCKCHAIN? This does not fit my definition of a blockchain. This simply fits my definition of a traditional *central* ledger or record of transactions. Since it is centrally controlled by the central bank XYZ itself, it does not need to "secure" its own ledger by something like "mining" of blocks or a proof of work algorithm. This is something you only need in a *de*centralized ledger, like Bitcoin, but you never need this for a centralized ledger, it would just be a waste of cost without any additional added value.
In other words: The central bank would be stupid to use the "blockchain" database format as the file format for its own central ledger, because it only had extra cost without any additional value whatsoever.
That's why - to come back to the original point - why a central bank's "alt-coin", as long as it is centrally maintained, has nothing to do with bitcoin-like currencies, but is instead much more similar to today's centralized money system (incl. features like that accounts can be frozen, money can be confiscated etc.), except that it would be even easier than today to do all this.
So, if I draw a straight line from left to right and let it denote the degree of freedom and decentralization and independence that a currency has, then Bitcoin would be located to the far right of the current fiat money, whereas the new central bank money you are outlining is located on the opposite side, even much further to the left, relative to today's fiat money.
So that central money you are outlining is even less similar to Bitcoin than today's fiat money is, so it is completely misplaced in this discussion of alt-coins (unless we call every currency, incl. EUR and USD, an alt-coin, but then we can equally well talk about "currency" instead of "alt-coin").
To be clear: My (and supposedly most people's) definition of "alt-coin" is that it must be characterised by a decentralized ledger (whether it is a blockchain or something similar) that is not controlled by a central authority. Neither current fiat nor your central bank money fits this definition even slightly, so it is a failure to bring this into the discussion about alt-coins.

No. How could you fix the price without some counterparty (=centralized entity) guaranteeing the exchange rate.

If you have an electric heat pump for heating, its efficiency is better than someting that converts electricity directly into heat.

I think git (linus torvald's open source  version system) is using the same technique. every new version is hashed with the previous hash, so you get a sequence of hashed versions. if one participant modifies something, the hashes become invalid and the others detect the fraud.
so a chain of hashes like in git is sufficient, no need to introduce the full complexity of a blockchain with mining, just use git. optional: register some hashes of your git versions in the bitcoin blockchain, if needed.

Thanks, so your initial comment that they shouldn't disregard invalid timestamps was wrong.
Now since we know that:
"A timestamp is accepted as valid if it is greater than the median timestamp of previous 11 blocks, and less than the network-adjusted time + 2 hours. "
So I can write my OP's question more concretely: A bad miner would set the timestamp to network adjusted time +2h +2sec or so. Then depending on network prpagation times etc. some miners will accept that block, and some won't.... Now my question is how this is going to work out?
Edit: ...and is it the "network-adjusted time" at time of reception of the block, or at the "current" time?
* If the latter, a miner that is receving such a block might not yet accept it at the time of reception, but 2 seconds later it may accept it. So it lost 2 seconds mining on the wrong chain...
* If the former, my original OP's question applies...

IP protocol is a good example! IP4 was good until it hit a scaling limit. Long-term it cannot survive because of scaling limitations, so IP6 will take over.
Same with Bitcoin: As adoption increases, scaling becomes a problem. If no provisions are taken to allow proper scaling, it will be replaced by another crypto. Scaling is a combination of provisions for L2 solutions (lightning, plus sidechains) plus block size increase.
Just because it took IP4 around 40 years to reach the scaling limit, it doesn't mean it will also take 40 years for Bitcoin. We all know that we need improvements already now, at an age of 8 years.
So the analogy is good, just the time scales are not the same - 40 vs. 8 years. Of course this is not surprising - it would be a big coincidence if both had the same 40 year timescale.

Note that the more bitcoin becomes mainstream, the higher the percentage of its users who are not experts in cryptography or math and just use it. And these are the ones determining the name, they vote with their feet.

I cannot say it often enough, so a last try: If there are three parties: A=myself, B=some other trader taking the other side of the bet, and C=Veritaseum, then A and B have to send their contracts (bitcoins) "into the blockchain" in some way (not to "C" directly as I understand), and "C" eventually decides (by looking up bloomberg or so) who gets the money (i.e. who wins the bet) - A or B. So I (=A) have to trust that "C" (=Veritaseum) does its job right. THEORETICALLY, it can be that B is identical to C, and that C injects the wrong outcome of the bet into the system, so that the funds go to B even if A won the bet. I am not saying you are planning to do this. I am just saying this is theoretically possible, and you are denying it all the time, which appears not trustworthy to me since you are denying the obvious.


I am curiously asking all these critical questions and have read the information materials that you linked to - that does meet my definition of "critical" and "curious".


You are spreading fog again and are not giving useful info. Don't treat me like I am stupid. This is we know the blockchain (and you are referring to "blockchain.info" I guess [one of the most popular bitcoin sites at all, and you mis-spell it], not "blockchain.io"). There we can follow the flows of bitcoins, but I have never seen in the blockchain an explicit flow of a Veritaseum contract of EUR/USD exchange rate - that's why I asked in my prev. post how you embed these contracts into the blockchain, and you did not answer.


Seems like a bad excuse. Patens pending are anyhow published 18 months after filing. And since you have filed them (therefore "pending"), your IP is protected, so no reason not to publish the content here. You are the CEO, so I guess you know these basics of patent law.


...but apparently tiny technical knowledge - but when posting on you have to accept many technical questions by nature. BTW, I have a track record as well, but it doesn't make any difference in a discussion, so it is needless to point this out, unless one lacks better arguments.


"wide open"? What you are doing here is the opposite: If anybody actually asks detailed questions, the information flow is "wide shut".


I tried in the open space here, but if I didn't get any relevant question answered by now, I am sure it would be a waste of time trying again in secret. My questions did not target your "proprietary trade secrets", but they are targeting the understanding of the PRINCIPLES of what you are OPENLY advertising, namely that you are using the open blockchain etc. and you are unable to answer or to point to a technical document that explains these principles in open space to a degree that it is verifyable by everyone, without getting in personal secret contact with you. And at the same time you say you are "wide open for examination" - what a contradiction!
So, since it is not verifiable now as a result of your secret policy, it is no better than any other closed-source service in my judgment. You claim it is open, but nobody can verify the procedures, it is like saying "I have an open source SW, but I won't give you the source code or give you any info other than blabla, but we are wide open for examination, adn I call it 'open source' anyhow because it sounds to trustworthy". Thanks, I understood.

Good posts (the last three posts in this row) - quite well reflecting my own line of thoughts! Thanks, great to see other minds think alike.
About the *sybil attack* for biasing the network time: Yes, I think that's a problem.
However, each miner should be able to disconnect from nodes and "blacklist" them, if those node's time is too far away from the own time ane obviously not sincere. I don't know if this is a feature already implemented in the bitcoin miner reference implementation; if not maybe it *should be implemented to bitcoin pro-actively*! And the threshold for what time deviation relative to the own time is still accepted could be parameterisable in config file (similar to some other parameters, like e.g. block inclusion criteria for transactions), if the miner's operator does not like the default value. This way I think "sybil timing attackers" should be sqeezed out of the Bitcoin network effectively.

That wouldn't be Bitcoin. That would be a fork that nobody wants. Bitcoin derives its value from scarcity. If this is changed ad libitum, the value of this "new unlimited bitcoin" will fall to near-zero immediately.
Just see the current controverse discussion about a comparably unimportant thing as the max blocksize. IT is really difficult to find consensus (compare the talk between gavin andresen (pro) and peter todd (contra) on letstalkbitcoin).
A lift of the 21M limit will never get accepted. That part of the world that continues mining the "original" (21M limited) coins will survive, and the miners will have no choice than to go back to the original Bitcoin, or shut down.

* You don't explain how to solve the problem of "different three blocks for different miners". Which are the *right* 3 blocks to choose from?
* The second part (no successive blocks by same miner) is not realizable, see other part of this thread. So the whole concept doesn't work, even if the "randomness problem" could be solved (which cannot be). Face it.
* You seem to defend a hopeless position instead of querying yourself. My arguments do not fall on any fertile ground, you are just throwing around half-finished thoughts in an attempt to defend a lost position, w/o presenting a complete self-contained solution.

There's 24g = 0.77oz of gold on earth (mined) per capita.
There's 0.003 BTC (ever mined) per capita.

PoS requires centralization every single block.
This one only gets effective upon special rare events, if at all. It would be an automatic mechanism to subsitute "manual" agreement to disregard the illegal fork by means of discussions or release of a bitcoin SW with a special checkpoint by Dev team.

As written in other replies of this post, this view is too narrow-minded in that it is limited to the purely technical-mathematical aspect of Bitcoin. If Chinese gov'ment, or whoever, makes an attack, it's a computational attack with sha256 power. It would target the Bitcoin protocol *as of today*. BUT: There are real people! Developers and community members, and they are everything but helpless. Never forget this, this is the "protective layer" on top of Bitcoin's strictly mathematical core protocol. And these people can decide many counter-actions that will effectively render the attack effect-less. One example is change of mining algo, another is to aggree community-wide to disregard the obviously fraudulent sub-chain, possibly with support of some formalized bitcoin sw enhancement (as I outlined in another post of this topic) to suffocate a potential follow-up attack from the start.
As a net result, the effect would be just temporary confusion, followed by an even more solid cryptocoin, because now people get aware that even a 51% attack cannot damage the coin sustainably.
@_date: 2017-02-21 09:52:56
that doesn't matter here. the point is **Coin ETF would steal true value from their investors** if they follow a "pick one side"-strategy. And they write it down explicitly that this is what they will do in case of a split.

So it cannot hardfork, because if it hardforks, it is not a hardfork but an altcoin, because this is your definition of terminology.
So it cannot hardfork because you give a different name to what others call a hardfork.
Then this is quite a meaningless post or yours.
Irrespective of terminology, you seem to be unaware that 51% of miners have the technological power to enforce a hardfork if they want to. 51% of miners can softfork by only accepting completely empty blocks, so the longest chain will turn out to be completely useless, while these 51% of miners define a new ruleset that builds on top of these empty legacy blocks, using extension blocks whose hash is included in those otherwise empty legacy blocks. These extension blocks can have another rule set, like BU ruleset or even change of the 21 Mill. limit (the latter more a theoretical possibility).
Clearly, proponents of the "old" ruleset (which might well be the majority of the ecosystem but not of the miners) will be forced to hardfork themselves, even if it is as small a change as declaring the block hash of the first "evil empty block" invalid acc. to new consensus rules. This would be a tiny change in source code but would be a fully fledged hardfork.

Some explanations anyway, in case you are not a troll...:
(1) If I operate a miner, and I am well connected, and despite of that a chain from an attacker arrives 30 minutes later, I KNOW it is an attack and this has to be disregarded. There's no way anybody can claim that this fork is the "good" one, I know it better! Any other honest miner must come to the same conclusion. If anyone accepts the long branch anyway, he must be abandoned and he disqualifies himself in the community.
This has nothing to do with centralization, everybody can do this independently by his own.
(2) If I switch on my miner and download the blockchain for the first time, I will accept the chain that is signed by a trusted entity of the community (trusted by myself, I can decide whom I trust, e.g. coinbase.com or whoever). It depends on reputation. This prevents that my miner will work on a wrong malicious chain. Once my miner is up&amp;running, I don't need the trusted nodes any more - except for passive crossing checking and raising an alarm if something looks inconsistent.
(3) You misunderstood. Not 90% of trusted nodes are required to fight a 51% attack. You completely misunderstood. I put the number in [] to indicate it is just a suggestion. Under normal cirumstances all 100% of miners I am trusting should come to the same judgement as to what blocks are malicious as my own miner. In case more than 10% do not agree with my own decision, this will be a singular event and manual intervention might be necessary based on discussions on the internet.
(4) The network split thing that I mentioned is only to avoid false alarms. You over-interpreted it.

I couln't disagree more. It was discussed 1000 times...
- zero conf transactions are very suitable for over the counter transactions for small to medium amounts.
- services that are using computers well-connected in the blockchain can be established (actually already exist) to provide transparency about whether a given unconfirmed transaction is being "attacked" by a double-spend or not. This provides &gt;99% certainty that an unconfirmed transaction will eventually be successful.
- shorter block times endanger the Bitcoin network's security as it makes selfish-mining or 51% attacks easier to perform and more difficult to detect. A stable blockchain needs to satisfy the condition "block generation time &gt;&gt; block propagation time".

Exactly. But there should be support by the wallets!


This is necessary, but not sufficient


Exactly. That is what I meant with "support" by wallet SW! The wallet SW should detect a stuck transaction (incoming or outgoing) and inform the user by offering an "acceleration", also recommending a fee that ensures that the acceleration (=CPFP TX) succeeds. From user perspective it appears as a new feature that can be understood and used by non-tech-users. This of course implies that under the hood the wallet app spends a certain unconfirmed transaction. *(edit: and/or the wallet app's GUI should offer a TX acceleration menu item in the context-menu [long-press] of an unconfirmed incoming or outgoing TX)*
No wallet app supports that today.

The thing is: Bitcoin is evolving, so one has to react to changing circumstances one way or another (keeping Bitcoin as it is is one way to react, changing certain things is another way).
Bitcoin transactions are soon approaching the current 1MB limit, that's a fact. So the only thing that is for sure is that nothing will be in 2016/2017 as it is today, irrespective of how Bitcoin is or is not changed. So whoever says "Bitcoin works fine as it is today, and it should remain like this" does not help in decision making, because in any case it will not "remain like this":
* If 1MB limit is kept, we'll see certain changes to the Bitcoin ecosystem, and we can discuss and argue how this affects Bitcoin's viability.
* If 1MB limit is raised to 20MB, we'll see certain changes to the Bitcoin ecosystem, and we can discuss and argue how this affects Bitcoin's viability.
So every decision has to take into consideration both viewpoints, and has to weigh the respective pros and cons of both ways forward.
Of course, when weighing arguments, subjective judgement comes into play, and it is inevitable that different individuals - no matter how good their intentions - come to different conclusions, simply because they have individual brains. One doesn't need conspiracy theories or hidden agendas to explain why it happens.
By consequence, unanimous agreement on this question hence seems to be an illusion.
That's the dilemma. How to make a decision in an open source environment like this? I don't know, and I am curious to see how all this will play out.

This assumes that humans(!) are slaves of machines and computers and algorithms and can do nothing. Fortunately, this is not true. The opposite is true: Humans have survived on this planet by now because they are creative and inventive. For the same reason I think Bitcoin will survive.
If there are 51% attacks, humans can find ways to eliminate the attackers. Those who say it is not possible are just not creative enough to think of some solution and re-iterate the dogma that "longest-chain-rule" in its current utmost simple and stubborn realization applies now *and forever*.
I wrote elsewhere in this thread an example of how an intelligent majority of honest Bitcoin netwok operators can de-facto circumvent such a 51% attack effectively by a quite simple protocol extension of the miners (that could be deployed VERY quickly if needed - probably it is already in Gavin's drawer, just to be prepared):

I as the operator of a miner I decide whom I trust in the community. As easy as that. For example, as of today, I would trust REPUTABLE members of the community like mycelium,coinbase, bitpay, bitcoin.de, slush, ..., and might decide not to trust BitGo. Usually, all reputable miners (or better: "supervision nodes") use the same criteria for rejecting malicious sub-chains, so it is not that important which list exactly I am using. The community will monitor the situation and some nodes might disqualify themselves by not rejecting an obviously malicious sub-chanin correctly, so there is a big incentive for all nodes that want to be trusted to behave correctly on all occasions.

Gavin &amp; Co. could release a patch where miners can decide to NOT accept  a longer chain upon certain conditions, which deems the longer chain a 51% or selfish mining attack [both of which look the same by the way]. These conditions could be well and cautiously engineered, for example the rejection of the longer chain could take effect if ALL of the following conditions are met:
* longer chain arrives xxx minutes or yyy blocks too late, OR too many legal transactions that are in the memory pool since long are not included in the recent new block (indicating a DoS attack by the miner having published the most recent block).
* network status is good, i.e. current miner is well connected to the global network with no signs of a network split
* [Optional] [90]% of a list of self configurable "trusted" nodes (characterised by their digital signature) deem this longer chain or last block "illegal" as well in agreement with this miner's own judgement (signed messages, Bitcoin protocol extension to submit signatures for blocks deemed illegal). These trusted nodes apply the same criteria as this miner is applying, see bullets 1 &amp; 2 above.
This way attackers who mine their blocks in secret and publish them too late, or miners behaving in a destructive manner, won't get their blocks accepted by the honest network participants.

Ok, that is your personal definition of dead. That's exactly what I am saying. Some would disagree and say that the limit where Bitcoin is dead is not 1.000 USD but 1 EUR. Others will set 2.63 USD as the "dead" limit, others 0.5235 EUR, and again others will relate it to the gold price, oil price or SDRs. It is arbitrary.
Some will even say it does not depend on price at all, and as long as there is a stable niche market and some companies still accept bitcoins, Bitcoin is still alive even at a value of 0.10 EUR per BTC.
There's no objective way one can say you are right and the others are wrong, or vice versa, there's no black and white, just grey-scales.
So the word "death" in connectin with bitcoin is only suitable to catch eyes in headlines, but unsuitable for a reasonable argument. Saying "Bitcoin is dead by 31.12.2017" makes no sense, because everybody has his own definition of "dead". Instead, saying "Bitcoin value is &lt; 1 USD (possibly inflation adjusted) by 31.12.2017" is a statement one can objectively measure.

current capacity is good for one on-chain tx per world inhabitant per lifetime, assuming 100 years life expectancy.
So with 100 MB blocks it would be 1TX per year per inhabitant.
Machine payments not even mentioned.
Hence, unless we'll see giant leaps in computer technology, Bitcoin is good as a peer-to-peer cash system only WITHOUT mass adoption. The more we come to mass adoption, the more the system will (must!) gradually turn into a settlement system, which is another word for "high-fee low-capacity system". This is a sober technical statement, not a political one. Whether we like it or not. Denying this is short-sighted wishfull thinking.
So the short and obvious answer to your question is: Technological leap-advances have to happen (followed by hardfork of course). Or human mass extinction of 99.9%, so that the 10 Billion people become 10 Million. But this will be too much too kerp up te hnical standards in the first place of course, so option 2 doesn't work either since it would bring mankind back to stoneage.
More realistically, we can postpone the point of too high fees by a combination of different methods:
- SegWit as an enabler for LN (on-chain capa increase is just a welcome side-effect)
- LN, to offload main chain substantially
- Side chains like Rootstock
- making Altcoins like Litecoin more adopted - its TX capacity will soon be 8x Bitcoin (after SegWit adoption), but currently its blocks are almost completely empty.
Especially the last point puzzles me. If the masses were really requesting cheap crypto-transactions, they could readily adopt Litecoin in daily life today - its TX fees are sub-cent, and its price volatility is even less than Bitcoin's. Smartphone apps and tools exist just like for Bitcoin. Since this doesn't happen, I think at the present time we are still VERY far away from mass adoption.
Eventually, if we get mass adoption, there is only one realistic scenario:
- Bitcoin on-chain is for big institution and rich individuals who can afford the high fees.
- Average people CAN use it, too, of course, but won't do it, because high fee.
- Average people will instead use one of (or a combination of): Bitcoin online wallets (not "owning" their coins themselves), or less secure sidechains or altcoins. These altcoins could be local coins or special purpose coins, traded between them via inter-coin decentralized LN based exchanges, by the way.
Only much later, upon technological leap advances, Bitcoin blocks can increase so much that it opens up again to the masses, gradually.

Basically "kicking off" means that all blocks that are published "too late" (as it must be the case in 51% attacks) get ignored by the honest miners. As simple as that. Simple protocol extensions could ensure that all honest miners behave the same way coherently, I outlined it further up in this thread in more detail.
Illustrative example:
* At time t0 all the world works on the chain A1-A2-...-An
* At time t1 the Block B, which is a successor of An, gets broadcast by a successful miner over the network. Now all the honest miners work on chain "A1-...-An-B".
* But the 51% attacker still works on "A1-...-An" and has already calculated block "Ba" in secret, i.e. is now mining on "A1-...-An-Ba"
* At time t2, the attacker has already found the new block "A1-...-An-Ba-Ca". The attacker is now broadcasting the blocks Ba and Ca publicly.
* If the time between t1 and t2 is more than what can be explained by normal network propagation times, it is *obvious* to all the honest miners that blocks "Ba-Ca" have been mined by a malicious miner. So they would just ignore it and continue working on the "honest" chain "A1-...-An-B". That's what Andreas said/meant. And I have outlined in my other post above how this could be done in practice, without manual human intervention, by a simple protocol-add-on (surveillance layer).

So whom are you blaming?
- Are you blaming Mycelium for not using the same exchange market as changetip? (by the way, YOU choose the market place in your Mycelium app based on which the USD values are displayed)
- Or are you blaming changetip for not using the same exchange market that you have setup in your Mycelium app (but how can changetip know how you configured your Mycelium app?)
- Or are you blaming "the world as a whole", because different markets have different prices? (in that case: welcome to the true world)
- Or are you blaming the world because market prices change over time (in that case: welcome to the true world)


Answer 1: You do: Your bitcoins are not worth more or less, just because changetip DISPLAYS another exchange rate that make them APPEAR being worth more or less. Again: remember you did transfer a commodoty called bitcoins, you did not transfer USD.
Answer 2: If you buy a share of company XYZ, or a gram of gold, or a gallon of oil, do you expect them to maintain their valuation in USD over time and do you expect them to be valued exactly the same on all exchange markets world-wide? If yes: Welcome to the true world - it doesn't work like that. If no: So for the same reason you sholdn't expect it from bitcoin.

I am referring to a solution for Android (or other OS) phones that guides the user the way for backup management etc. similar as in "Mycelium" wallet app, but where one special instance of this app is installed on an OFFLINE phone.
The "work-split" between offline and online phone is exactly what we know from e.g. Armory offline wallets (i.e. the offline phone's only [and exclusive] job is to keep the privkeys and do the signing of transactions), just the handling is easier: Instead of exchanging the signed/unsigned tx strings between the devices via USB stick or SD card, you can do it without "mechanical hassle" by simply using QR codes (or in case the tx string is too long: animated QR codes).
The concrete format of the "animated QR code msg exchange" could be standardized, such that normal wallet apps (running on ONline smartphones) can serve as online-front-end to this electronic offline wallet.
The reason why I choose an (Android) phone instead of a PC for this concept:
- An app is easy to install on a smartphone by any noob
- You have your online-smartphone always at hand, unlike your online PC
- Smartphones are more portable than PCs and take less space if your flat is small.
- QR code reading HW capability already built-into the device
- The longer the smartphone era lasts, the more people already have their second or third phone in use, and their old phone is not being used any more. So the extra HW cost is zero because the HW is already there. Otherwise, for the "offline PC" solution most people would have to buy another PC (and even the cheapest one is more expensive than a cheap new Android phone)

You must be very young, so I'll explain like you were 5:
You sent some BTCs to changetip and the same number of bitcoins (minus tx fees) arrived at changetip. So no bitcoins got lost!!!
The other thing is what is DISPLAYED on your screen as the equivalent USD value. If changetip and mycelium app use different exchanges, or if exchange rate has changed in the meantime, the USD value that is DISPLAYED is different. That's all.
*Edit: In other words: Your first sentence "I just sent $10 from my mycelium wallet to changetip" is already wrong, and that's were your misunderstanding starts: You did not send 10 USD. You sent a certain number of BTCs that Mycelium considered the EQUIVALENT of 10 USD at the CURRENT exchange rate of an exchange market place configured in the Mycelium app.*

Reducing block time to less than 10min is a bad idea because it brings security problems. When looking closer to the issue, what you see is that a stable network requires the block propagation time in the network to be SUBSTANTIALLY lower than the block generation time, w.r.t. issues and defense mechanisms related to selfish mining, 51% attack or forking.
So 10min appears to be an excellent compromise and should not be reduced - 1min is definitly too low - ok for test coins like dogecoin, but not ok for the maincoin (bitcoin).
As far as confirmation in over-the-counter scenarios is concerned, zero conf. transactions are very reliable for small amounts, this has also been discussed many many times. It is practically a non-issue, and the notion that the buyer of a coffee has to wait 10min average at the point of sale is an obsolete legend.

If the 51% attack is about invalidating blocks by broadcasting secretly mined blocks minutes afterwards, then this can be easily detected by any honest miner, as Andreas suggests and as I have elaborated [here](
But I think there is another, more subtle kind of 51% attack. This other attack is not about making double spends (and therefore invalidating blocks thought to be valid minutes or hours later by abusing the "longest chain" rule), but about creating a permanent network fork. This attack would look like this:
* The attacker has &gt;51% of mining power
* The attacker has a world-wide network of "probes" that enables to detect blocks as quick as possible, no matter where on earth they are mined, and deos not rely on normal multi-hop Bitcoin network propagation delays.
How it works:
* We start with the state where all the world is currently working on chain of blocks A-B-C.
* The attacker has already calculated blocks "Da" and "Ea" successors of the current chain, yielding a valid chain "A-B-C-Da-Ea". But the attacker has not yet published them!
* Some honest miner has found a block D and publishes it immediately: A-B-C-D.
* The attacker reacts very quickly and publishes block Da as quick as possible (injecting it at multiple points of the Bitcoin network to minimize propagation times).
* Due to network propagation times, some of the honest miners will receive Da before D, others will receive D before Da. So some honest miners will now work on A-B-C-D, others on A-B-C-Da (both have the same length). --&gt; The blockchain has forked! (I assume that the miners' rule here is: "In case of two blocks, take that one that you receive first")
* At some point in time some honest miner mines a block "E", yielding A-B-C-D-E, or it mines a block "E2", yielding A-B-C-Da-E2.
* Again, the attacker releases block Ea acc. to "A-B-C-Da-Ea" as fast as possible, so the blockchain remains forked amongst the honest miners!
* Etc. - the blockchain remains forked forever!
There is no easy way a normal honest miner can tell which of the blocks are coming from the attacker.
The identification of the malicious blocks is easy if the malicious blocks are published minutes later, like in a "normal" 51% double-spend attack. But with this "51% forking attack" outlined here, it seems that it won't be that trivial to identify the malicious blocks (or the "NSA chain", as Andreas puts it).
But there should be another method that can be set up to identify the malicious blocks by every single honest miner: It could be done by a modification of the rule that determins which block to accept, block "D" or "Da", in above example:
* Today, I assume(!) the rule is simply: If a miner receives a block "Dx" and a block "Dy" (both of which are compliant successor of current chain A-B-C), then the  miner will "take" that one which arrives earlier!
* proposal of a new rule: If blocks Dx and Dy arrive within [tbd] seconds ([tbd]=a time constant to be defined, taking typical network propagation times into account), then the honest miner will take that block that contains more recent transactions of the memory pool (only considering those transactions that were in the miner's memory pool before any of Dx and Dy was received!). The idea is simple: Since the malicious attacker's block "Da" was already secretly mined well in advance, and only held back until an honest miner publishes block "D", the block "Da" will not contain the most recent transactions from the memory pool of the honest miner, while block "D" will.
So the honest miner will take block "D", and not block "Da", even if block "D" only arrives shortly after "Da".
So, after all, also this kind of 51% attack (which tries to achieve a "permanently forked status" of the blockchain instead of a proper double-spend) can be avoided by a reasonable protocol (or mining rule) modification applied by all honest miners.
*Edit: The same happens if the attacker not only broadcasts Da, but both Da and Ea: The honest miner will compare the youngest transactions contained in D and Da (using it's own memory pool as the bases for this) and will deem block "Da" invalid, if it judges that the blocks "Da" was mined too long in advance and hence was held back for a too long time. For the same reason, it will then also not accept block Ea of course.*
*As a result, the attacker needs to have MUCH more than 51% to still be successful: The percentage required to attack the network would become a percentage that depends on the time "[tbd]" (see above) in relation to the 10 minutes average block interval. As a side remark: This shows that a too short block time is bad. The block time [10 min] must be much higher than average network propagation time to enable an efficient defence against 51% (or generally: majority mining power) attacks of this kind.*

blockchain.info is only one of many bitcoin wallets, and a bad one with a long history of bugs and design flaws.
I wouldn't recommend anyone to use this wallet.
It would be greater news if also the other bitcoin wallets introduced this feature.
It would also be good news if some free blockexplorer sites (which usually also are full nodes with a mem pool) published the fee estimates and provided open APIs to be used by wallet SW (similar to APIs for exchange rate queries).
It would also be great news if bitcoin core and/or classic SW enabled fss-RBF for *all* tx such that tx with too low fees can be "unstuck" easily  and if all wallets used this to increase fees of "stuck" transactions.
But the news that one of the worst Bitcoin wallets implements a (admittedly good) new feature is of limited greatness.

for me a blockchain is a certain kind of ledger. Words like tangle are just words, do not explain ANYTHING to me whatsoever.
if iota recods only the two last transaction, then what if a iota is tranferred from A to B to C to D to E? How can it be proven that A is no more owner of a iota, if the Tx "A-&gt;B" is nit included in the ledger any more.

Investor legend Warren Buffet already said (
*"Never invest in a business you can’t understand."*
This rule holds for all serious investors!
Note that for the same rason that today's investors do not invest in Bitcoin companies at large scale, Warren Buffet himself never invested in companies of the "new economy" but rather in "traditional" businesses of the industrial sector - because that is what *he* himself understood.
Clearly, Bitcoin is too new to be understood by the wide majority of investors today, unlike traditional internet and social networking companies that have been around for a while and where the mechanisms for making cash (advertising etc.) are pretty well understood.
Having said this, the investments in Bitcoin related companies are still considerable already - comparable to (even more than) investments to the early internet companies in the mid 1990-ies.
Every new trend has to start somewhere. Alone the fact that the majority(!) of investors does not trust in Bitcoin companies as much as in other investments today(!) does not mean that Bitcoin will not be a success story eventually.
So the approach to *"measure the trust (of the financial world) in Bitcoin in terms of investments made"* is certainly appropriate. But remember it only reflects the trust and knowledge of the AVERAGE investor as of TODAY, and does not say anyting about Bitcoin's true potential for an investor who is INFORMED about Bitcoin.

Obviously, most people don't understand what mining is for, they think its only purpose is "creating money" and don't understand that the main aspect is securing a DISTRIBUTED DECENTRLIZED ledger. So they don't understand that a private(!) blockchain is an overkill that makes as much sense as a combustion engine for a smartwatch. They don't understand that an SQL database or a simple spreadsheet is much superior over a blockchain for centralized ledgers.

If this is so, I am a bit shocked. It means I have a smartphone HD BIP-32/39/44 wallet, I receive a payment to one of my "older" addresses for whatever reason (whose private keys only exist inside my wallet), and it is perfectly ok if the wallet SW does not make use of these coins but hides it away from me the user as if these bitcoins didn't exist? Is my understanding correct?


That is something that FSS-RBF can do, and that would be no problem for me at all, I would actually welcome such feature for all, even non-RBF-tagged, transactions. The problem is if you can replace it such that the supermarket gets nothing, i.e. fraud.


Are you serious?
It is improper to ask for non-RBF payments by the supermarkt? So then the supermarket has to ask the customer: You can pay with RBF and stay here, pysically, until the first confirmation occurs (takes avg. 10min, but may also take ~60min at times), and don't get your goods before that, or you pay non-RBF and we accept 0-conf. So the goods stay in the conveyor belt, the cashier cannot process other customers, and the customer until the TX gets confirmed. NO WAY!
Me as a supermarket operator would make a BIG SIGN:
**BITCOIN ACCEPTED - but no RBF-flagged transcations**
And if the customer does not agree, then fine - he can pay with cash ore credit card, or with lightcoin of course.
The next supermarket nearby says:
**BITCOIN ACCEPTED (also RBF)**
And it gets regularly defrauded by double-spending RBF-paying customers (because letting him wait for the goods avg(!) 10 min is not an option). It won't take long this supermarket will say: Bitcoin is shit, 100% insecure, never again! Only cash and fiat money is good and secure, no more experiments!
This is an excellent way to kill Bitcoin.

Many reasons, some having been named here already.
Another reason: Bitcoins move from early adoptors owning many bitcoins and cashing out (or "panic-selling"?) into pockets of people buying their first bitcoins these days.
Imagine each bitcoin (or satoshi) in existence today is associated with a price tag indicating the price that the current owner of this bitcoin had payed to aquire this bitcoin. Now imagine that you collect all these ca. 13.8 Mill price tags and calculate the average "bitcoin purchasing price tag". As long as this average price tag is much lower than the current market price (which is still the case today), there is a down-pressure of price because people tend to cash out. When prices fall, people panic-cash-out even more. But each time they cash out a bitcoin, this bitcoin's average purchasing price tag changes, so the averge price tag increases with time while btc market prices are falling.
At some point in time, the gap between average price tag and market price closes, people have no more reason to panic-sell, and also bitcoin wealth becomes more distributed amongst more people (people may cash-out when owning 100,000 USD in btc, but when owning only 10 or 100 USD in btc they simply forget about it and sit and wait - there is not a lot at stake, no reason to panic-cash-out).
Once we reach this point, down-pressure stops, new people continue buying but less "veterans" continue cashing-out, so price will stabilize and slowly increase again. When will this be? At 200 USD? At 100 USD? At 50 USD? At 10 USD? Nobody knows.
Edit: New block reward halving (currently expected for 21 May 2016 based on average block generaton rate since last halving on 28 Nov 2012) may also be a point where reduced new supply may push prices up again.

I think if he finds out Bitcoin can be used to avoid the Mexican money transfer tax, he'll find it logical to forbid it. Just as he found it logical to prohibit people of certain countries entering the US.
He didn't care that even big tech companies like apple, google, and virtually the complete silicon valley, the seed of US's innovation power, suffers from his decisions. So he wouldn't care either if a small comparably negligible set of fintech startups suffers from his decision. He wouldn't mind destroying highly-qualified jobs and the corresponding industry in california and east coast if he can instead create plenty of low-quality jobs for things like building a wall (which would anyway suit the US American qualification profile much better). He is representing old industry like construction and oil, he is an old man who does not understand modern technologies - even if he tries, he just cannot understand it, it's beyond his capabilities.
So why do you think Trump won't forbid Bitcoin? Serious question.

I see what you mean but you do me wrong.
I am a big proponent of log scale in normal charts because otherwise one has no idea if the RATE of change of a price increases, decreases, or stays the same over time, and exponentially looking charts in linear scale can easily fool the observer.
However, in this case the intend is to show that the rate of change (over 32d, 224d, or 365d) was much bigger in the past and mimiscule now, in comparison. My purpose was not to show the absolute value of that change.
But I see that you are interested in exactly this, the absolute percentage of change as of today. And the absolute value is not visible well in my charts, smaller numbers are not resolved.
Of course for this purpose log scale would serve your purpose, if you really want to know exactly if the current growth percentage is 30% or 60% or 120%, while it was in the 4 digit region in earlier bubble times.

I also think that it is very realistic to assume that we'll see bitcoin prices between 5 USD and 10,000 USD all the way in 2015. (which is a factor 45 up or factor 45 down from today's price levels - personally, I rather expect levels heading towards 5 USD than to 10,000 USD)

Not at all, because circumstances change:
As tx/s increases and we hit the 1MB limit (probably in 2016), Bitcoin will NOT work as it does today, no matter if limit is increased or not, someting will change in any case:
* if 1MB limit gets not increased: tx fees rise, delays of confirmation increases, public perception of Bitcoin (and its characteristics vs. fiat) changes...
* if block limit increases: data rates increase, miners need more power, ...

Very very bad!
Unbelievable. They used random data from random.org - solely!!
How stupid and utmost naive is that? A smartphone(!) has plenty of good physical random generators built-in from all its physical sensors, like camera, mic, touchscreen, magnetic sensor etc. It would be so easy for any app to acquire excellent random physical data from them, and XOR them (such that random data is only corrupted if it is corrupted from ALL of these random sources simultaneously).
Instead, blockchain.info app takes the most dumb and risky approach one could imagine! Actually, it is so dumb that I would not even have imagined this approach, which is stupid beyond imagination!
Blockchain.info app has a had history of flaws - there have also been reports (many months ago) of bitcoin transmissions not getting into a block due to low fees or too low amount (546 satoshi limit), such that the amount was hanging "in limbo" for a long time. It would be so easy for an app to make some checks at the GUI and inhibit execution of such transmissions, but again blockchain.info team seems to lack fundamental basic competencies. Apparently they are just hackers, script kiddies, but no serious programmers, acc. to the facts laying on the table.
**TL;DR: I would not recommend using blockchain.info's wallet app to anybody!** - even after fixing THIS problem. With their **track record of bad big flaws** it seems unlikely that this was their last one. Fortunately there are enough alternatives.

Right, this may happen. But if the ponzi-scheme breaks (bank run), there is no central bank that can "print" more bitcoins to bail-out this private bank.
So small "tensions" in the system will "unload" more frequenly, without big tensions adding up more and more because of bailouts and bailouts. So we will see more frequent smaller earthquakes now and then, but not the one disasterous earthquake.
So market participants must be more cautions from the beginning, because everyone knows there is no lender of last resort.
So the whole banking culture should not become as broken as it is today.
@_date: 2016-01-12 01:36:51




It must be a big coincident if a TX has no change, i.e. if an output plus fee is exactly equal to an input.
The norm is that there is change, already today. The wallet would simply have to make sure that change is also used for the remaining 0.01% of TX where otherwise no change is required.
This does not make TXs more expensive.

@_date: 2017-02-19 11:41:49


(fixed typo for you)
Exception: Imagine miners invent a new kind of hostile "BU hard softfork" that works as follows:
Acc. to post-fork protocol rules, the new blockchain consists of a "base chain" (bach) and an "extension chain" (exch).
The bach consist of valid legacy blocks (hence "softfork") that must be completely empty(!) acc. to the new softfork rules (that's the hostile part in it). The blocks of the exch are data sets of arbitrary size and new (or old) data format t.b.d. (hence "hard" softfork) that contain the actual transaction data (as do the normal blocks today).
Each block of the bach contains exactly one special transaction that contains the hash of the associated extension chain block. And of course, as usual, the block of the bach is secured by the usual PoW. So via this hash, the extension block is declared valid.
This way, a "new BU" that has 51% hash power can make the legacy Bitcoin completely useless because no legacy transactions at all would be included in the longest (most PoW) chain any more. So, under these circumstances anyone who wants to make a transaction would have no choice but to use the new BU chain.
Of course, the world wouldn't stop here.
That part of the ecosystem, whether a majority or not doesn't matter (probably it will be a vast majority) will define a most simple hard(!) fork as follows: The hard fork will simply declare a block hash "x" in block height "n" invalid, where that block denotes the first "hostile block" of the BU chain! This condition will become essential part of bitcoin's consensus rules. That's all! Otherwise it is the good old bitcoin.
Clearly, the eco-system will largely follow this "true" Bitcoin and leave BU fork alone, reducing BU coin's value, and miners' revenues. So miners will get back to bitcoin core to make profit.
Ironically, after BU fork has died this way, longest chain will become bcore chain again, and the new hard fork rule won't be needed any more - it turned out a temporary rule for the purpose of self-defense.

The **wallet of the merchant** should...
- display an incoming 0-conf tx and should show if it is RBF or not, to allow the merchant to reject Full-RBF 0-conf payments altogether.
- If an incoming 0-conf is non-RBF, it should show the likelihood of block inclusion into the next block (based on mem-pool and tx fee).
- Also, It should show and warn when double-spends have been detected on non-RBF transactions (possible by Bitcoin network observation "probes").

Ok, thanks!
So I did implicitly assume that the sender...
*    uses a local wallet rather than a shared/web wallet (in fact I did mention the web wallet use case in my post)
*    didn’t drop her phone in a puddle in the meantime (unlikely if the fund is returned in the same minute - but then she should have a backup anyway)
*    didn’t have her phone stolen in the meantime (unlikely if the fund is returned in the same minute)
*    used coins she received via a simple transaction to pay you (I assume e.g. if the sender sent a Coinjoin tx to the merchant, and this was also tagged as RBF - ok, then the wallet maker of web wallet server really messed around with advanced features...)
*    knows (or can definitely work out) who is sending that money to her and why (not needed in my use-case, it's clear from the context, i.e. from the timing and the amount)
*    is comfortable with the security implications of address re-use (should be ok, it is an exceptional "defence" of the merchant for "undue" use of RBF)
*    is comfortable with the privacy implications of address re-use (should be ok, it is an exceptional "defence" of the merchant for "undue" use of RBF)
So after all, my understadning is that my suggestion is practically feasible except in a case the merchant receives the RBF by something very special like Coinjoin - ok in this case merchant has to as customer for a refund address.

[PART 2 of 2]
[...continued from [part 1](


Sure - in my example I took for granted that mem pool is full enough as a pre-condition and I have failed to mention it explicitly.


Sure. But I think I made clear by above example that it would be a big and fortunate coincident when a self-produced blocks size acc. to short term profit considerations produces the best block size vote that this miner considers to be in in the best long-term interests for the eco-system and for himself.


After reading my above text, you probably know already my reply to this: Miners to not "want" to mine 1 MB blocks as such in this example. If they can, they might find that 3 MB or even 5 MB maximizes their short-term profit for a self-mined block. But for long-term **sustainability** consideration, they may not want to have a BSL of 2x3=6 or 2x5=10 MB. These are two different optimization problems that are "artificially coupled" by the fixed multiplier of bitpay's proposal.
As a result, the overall system will not work at its "most optimum operational point", so to say.


I think I read that one. Of course moving BSL down comes at the expense of forgoing TX fees, which becomes more and more hurtful in the future the more block rewards are replaced by TX fees.
And again, as we apply the "median" method, very very low size blocks do not offset my own "too high votes" (or vice verse), all that counts is the number of blocks above or below my own desired BSL.


I know and I agree. These mechanisms will certainly hamper a too fast, too excessive BSL increase in principle. But it does not say how far away from the optimum operational point the system would converge to. It would certainly not hit the same point as if sustainability-driven (long-term) vote could be independent from the short-term-profit-driven behaviour.
 










Yes,  in principle I understand and agree with these self-regulation mecahnisms. Even if your numbers are partly examples/guesses (same as mine), the idea is clear. And it is also clear that changes in the landscape like technological evolution, shift of mining farms towards other geographies/countries, change of TX fee and block reward structures, will shift these self-regulating forces in one direction or another.
For example, the more TX fees replace block reward in the future, the more hurtful it will be for a miner to "vote" for keeping the block limit, and the more miners will be drawn towards "short-term-thinking egoistic" behaviour and to fill the blocks to the max, thereby increasing the BSL even further (because of the protocol's fixed multiplier), until the TX fees get smaller and smaller, this could become a self-enforcing vicious cycle. Not likely to happen any time soon (as long as block rewards still dominate), but we have to look into the future to see if a given solution is suitable for the long-term.


All agreed. But the trap is that too much "short-term egoistics" may lead into a trap that really endangers Bitcoin, as described above. You can call it "vicious cycle" or "tragedy of commons".


This is also fully clear, and this is what I talking about in the top of this long (sorry) post. This is what I meant when I talked about all the different variables that get "mixed together" in an "optimization function", and the result is an optimum block size or optimum block size limit. My point is that...
* ...the "optimization function" for the short-term (=best size of a self-mined block) and
* ...the "optimization function" for the long-term system stability/sustainability as a whole (=best block size limit)
are much more different than what one would think at first glance. However, the "bitpay's" protocol proposal couples these two: Every short-term economical decision (self-mined block size) is at the same time translated into a long-term strategy decision for the Bitcoin system as a whole, by means of the "fixed multiplier", which may lead into catastrophe unless the majority of miners is altruistic (which cannot be expected).
Hence a long-term protocol proposal should be designed that decouples these two factors, or in other words, a proposal should not suffer the "tragedy of commons". One possibility is via voting (like in BIP-100, or better and much favoured by myself, the further developed but apparently little acknowledged [BIP-100.5](
Another possibility is to amend bitpay's proposal only slightly, as I explained [here in this thread - 2nd link of this post]( This will have almost no effect today (as block rewards dominate over TX fees) but it will avoid the possibly disastrous tragic pitfall for the future. This is achieved in that a short-term decision for a self-mined block size between current_BSL/2 and current_BSL (corresponding to a BSL vote between current_BSL and 2 times current_BSL) creates the same miner reward from TX fees for the miner of this block. So the decision for whether the miner votes for a BSL that lies between current BSL or 2 times current BSL can be made independent from short-term profit considerations and solely based on long-term strategic considerations. The "not immediately paid out" part of the ~~block reward~~ *TX fees* *(typo corrected)* is paid out to other miners in a random or pre-determined fashion, so the miners as a whole do get their fair share, no Tx fees vanish in limbo. But the incentives are now decoupled between long- and short-term interests.
With this small but decisive amendment to bitpay's proposal, I consider it an enormously powerful yet stunningly wonderful and simple method.
@_date: 2016-01-07 04:56:13
I understand very well your technical points. But I am coming to different conclusion about economics / reality.
Credit card fraud is so simple and happens so often, still CCards are used. This is probably against all game-theory, but still economic reality. Should we disclose all CC numbers openly to make Cc fraud even simpler and thereby remove this dangerous practice, or should we leave the free market get along with it?
Moreover, I think we are leading the wrong discussion here if we talk about what people can do in terms of forking the bitcoin-core sw and changing the conditions of forwarding of transactions. This can always be done as you correctly say, for all (also non RBF-tagged) transactions. So then we don't need changes in bitcoin-core at all on this.
But bitcoin-core does make the change to introduce full-RBF tagged transaction, because they are aware that their sw is (at least for the time being) the dominating sw deployed on nodes and hence determines how the network usually behaves as a whole, de-facto.

Blocks 164246 and 124724 are essentially the same:
Block reward = 50 BTC, TX fees = X BTC, with X&gt;0.
Miner claims only Y BTC, with Y&lt;50, so the miner foregoes F BTC with F= 50+X-Y, and the number of bitcoins that never come into existence is Z = "50-Y" BTC.
- In block 124724, miner foregoes F=0.10000001 BTC, and Z=0.00000001 BTC never come into existence.

@_date: 2016-01-09 05:02:51
I see, so acc. to that logic you say it is not allowed to reject a block because it is too big.
I.e. if my own limit is 3 MB (if I am a miner), but a new foreign block arrives with 100 MB, I HAVE to validate it and mine on top of it (because all other miners also will mine on it, so I have to do so, too)?
Just a question for understanding.
My assumption was that miners in BU use-case would set a limit for this as well (if not in reference implementation of BU, then in BU forks run by miners practically), i.e. a foreign block larger than XX MB will be ignored because considered spam. And then the question is, what is "XX", and then the miner operators have to talk to each other as I outlined.
So I was taking different assumptions than you, this is clarified now, ok.
Assuming your model of BU, I see another problem with BU:
The "tragedy of the commons" is a problematic threat for BU, that will manifest more and more as TX fees take over block rewards. Miners will more and more drift to greater blocks, to collect the TX fees, in an effort to maximize short-term profits for the current block. So block sizes will increase more and more and TX fee revenues will diminish, because the miners destroy their own base of income by their short-term egositic economical optimization behaviour, which is normal. It's like in real life, nobody start with environmental protection first, it gives each of the individual small players a disadvantage, but if everybody is forced to so it by law, everybody wins.
Don't get me wrong, I am far from being a "small blocker" (just my last post in my history I had with luke-jr drove me crazy, you can look at my posting history), but BU as you describe it goes too far for me, because it will be driven only by egoistic short-term thoughts of the miners, and this even more so, the more the mining landscape is fragmented without dominating mining pool (which is what we all desire and have to design Bitcoin for). This is unhealthy, to say the least, for the  eco-system. Miners are able to influence the evolution of Bitcoin in two ways: optimize short term profit (current self-mined block), and optimize long-term strategy. Like in real life (life quality, environmental protection, organization of societies), also for Bitcoin these optimization targets are not going in the same direction, i.e. you have to build an eco-system framework that enables miners to optimize for both. The only way to avoid this destructive evolution with BU is when miners sit together and discuss actual block size limits that they commonly agree upon, as I was assuming above.
If you do not know what I am talking about here, read [this post]( (and the corresponding part 2 of it). There I describe why also bitpay's current proposal suffers this problem of the tragedy of commons, but it can be fixed with a simple amendment to bitpay's proposal.

Can you explain this logic "and therefore larger txs", please?
Why do larger blocks mean larger transactions? I don't see it **at all**. Nothing is easier than forbidding transactions greater than x.
Just because streets get longer, it doesn't mean that "therefore" cars become longer. There is a street that is 100 miles long, but I never saw a car whose length is even close to 100 miles.
It seems to me that this whole argument is artificial. Would happy to learn why I am wrong.

*(highlighting already present in original text)*
So what? Why is it horrible if it cannot be theoretically calculated? Let experience speak instead! Also losses due to shop lifting cannot be theoretically calculated. Still real world shops do exist despite shop lifting.
Each merchant can make its own statistics on 0-conf fraud (if any) and adapt pricing models (or other means) accordingly. But changing the most widely used reference SW such that fraud risk becomes much higher (and better theoretically calculatable) is the wrong answer.

@_date: 2016-01-19 23:33:07
SegWit is no scaling fix. it is a significant one time change that outsources blockchain data to a different chain that still has to go through the fibres of a fully validating node. so it is just a bookkeeping trick.
All the other examples are not yet in existence, so claiming btc-hardcore project had achieved something here is incorrect.
What they DID achieve is reduction of Bitcoin's utility by introducing full RBF.
I put 1 and 1 together and am very much repelled from Btc-hardcore and attracted by the other pragmatic project that follows the classical idea of satoshi and bitcoin's social contract.
@_date: 2016-01-07 05:21:09
Thanks for asking. Let me summarize these terms:
* **Full RBF** = RBF scheme where a transaction can be replaced FULLY arbritarily, i.e. the same inputs can go to completely different outputs, thereby opening up arbitrary double spend fraud possibilities extremely easily (if implemented on most nodes, which happens if it is in bitcoin-core = the reference and most widely deployed node SW).
* **FSS RBF** = RBF scheme ("first seen safe") where a replacing tx must maintain the outputs (i.e. the fist seen outputs are safe). I.e. more precisely: if at least one output address of the new TX has a smaller output amount than the original tx, it will be discarded by the node like a non-RBF transaction. Clearly, RBF now only works if the new TX that is constructed to replace the old one in "FSS RBF" fashion carries an additional (new) input address which enables the new tx to have a higher tx fee than the first one. Note that a wallet SW that wants to support FSS-RBF must hence keep an input "in reserve" to enable rss-rbf, or ask the user to first "load" a newly generated address. (This would be easy to program by an even under-average skilled wallet programmer and certainly cannot be a serious argument to drop the idea of FSS-RBF altogether.)
* **Opt-in**: Whether RBF is opt-in or not is independent of "full" vs. "fss" rbf, i.e. both "full" and "fss" rbf could be implemented as "always" or as "opt-in". I am pleading for fss-rbf and I am against full-rbf, even if full-rbf is opt-in. Because even if full-rbf is opt-in, merchants (whether online or brick&amp;mortar) anyway have to spend efforts to implement mechanisms to detect full-rbf transactions and treat them in a certain manner, which implies efforts in SW implementation and educating cashiers/staff personel. This makes Bitcoin unnecessarily complicated and significantly reduces the attractiveness of its adoption by people who are no IT/Bitcoin specialists. Note: FSS-RBF does not need to be opt-in, it could (and should) be standard for all transactions and thereby avoid having transaction tags - hence simpler than the opt-in full rbf.
* **CPFP (child pays for parent)** is not an "RBF" scheme, because nothing gets "Replaced". CPFP can serve the same purpose as fss rbf, but total blockchain load and total spent fees are higher when using this method. Nevertheless, both techniques, FSS-RBF and CPFP should be implemented. The advantage of CPFP over FSS RBF is that also the recipient can "unlock"/"accelerate" a tx that is stuck due to too low fees. By definition of the mechanism, CPFP, if implemented, is always active and never subject to an "opt-in/opt-out" flag.

Better: Make a list of trusted "supervision nodes", these are supervising the network for strange behaviour like overly many orphans or so and distributes warnings upon blocks that are likely the result of 51% or selfish mining attacks. Every other Bitcoin node (=miner) can listen to these supervision broadcasts and can decide to either just display a warning, or to autonomously decide not to work on blocks that are tagged "malicious" and instead work on the "good" (even if shorter) chain.
This supervision mechanism is a protocol next to Bitcoin. It does not require any changes to the core protocol. Instead it just adds a layer on top that makes recommendations to other miners (or listens to such recommendations) as to which blocks are likely the result of an attack.
This supervision mechanism can also be used to trigger actions amongst the devs like releasing new Bitcoin SW with new checkpoints.
I know that this is a solution that adds a trust aspect to Bitcoin (network of trust) which was designed as an inherently trust*less* system. But I think eventually such "supervision layer" will be useful. Probably we'll see it first with dodgecoin, whose fast decay of reward and hence hashing power will make it prone to attacks soon, and a supervision layer of trusted nodes will prove effective in squeezing out malicious miners and keep it safe. It is still much better than a network relying on central checkpointing, like PoS coins.
It would remain the trustless system as of today, and only in very few and clearly identifyable instants the supervision mechanism would kick in and give us also a metric of network health.
We'll see.
Edit: Every miner can decide which supervision nodes it is listening to. Typically it would be a list of respected participants in the community like blockchain.info, slush and alike. In the supervision protocol a supervision node identifies itself by a Bitcoin address whose priv.key is used to sign the warning broadcasts. Every miner can define his own list of bitcoin addresses that it accepts as warnings in the supervision protocol.

sure it would be less efficient then rbf. but better than nothing.
By the way: Not every wallet supports RBF (unless the wallet supports it).
Likewise: Yes, not all transactions have change, but you still have no point in saying that, because: If the wallet supports it, all payment transactions do have change.

You completely misunderstand how SegWit works, and what soft fork is all about, your post makes no sense, sorry.
when I say a miner violates SegWit I don't mean it ignores a SegWit block but that it spends a SegWit tx in a way compatible to legacy protocol ("anyone can spend") but incompatible to SegWit.
Of course, under wrong assumptions one comes to different conclusions - probably part of the reason people are against SegWit is this lack of comprehension.

if it was no bip70, the amount (minus tx fee) should be just "returned to sender" (=one of the input addreses) by the merchants as a standard practice:
* if the sender has control over his wallet's keys, all is good, he receives the refund on his wallet.
* if the sender had used a hosted wallet w/o own control of input priv keys, we has to talk to his hosted wallet provider to refund him - the hosted wallet provider shouldn't have allowed him to make an rbf flagged tx in the first place for the given transaction. here the hosted wallet provider should take sufficient care to avoid that their costumers trigger tbf transaction unless they know exactly what they are doing.

The "their [the hodlers'] non-p2sh transactions"? These transactions don't belong to the hodlers more than to anyone else. A hodler can choose between different kinds of transactions just like anybody else. No rule is forbidding a hodler to use any kind of transaction. All users are equal in bitcoin (not all transactions are equal [not even today] but all users are!).
So the complete argument is nuts.

Definitely the other way round: Altcoins are inexpensive to mine because they are cheap. If there would be more miners, markets wouldn't suddenly pay more fiat for the altcoin. However, if people paid more fiat for the altcoin (higher demand due to speculation, utility or whatever), mining would become more profitable, automatically meaning that more miners would enter the space, making the coin more difficult to mine.

1) Answer: Because Bitcoin is **not** infinitely divisible!
Instead, the smallest unit is 1/100Mill BTC. So after each block reward halving the new block reward is calculated by halving the old reward and thereafter rounding DOWN to an integer multiple of the smallest Bitcoin unit, which is 0.00000001 BTC. So at some point we reach exactly zero.
That's how the protcol is defined.

hmm - then I would respectfully disagree and refer to simple maths. take any values: bandwidth = x, cpu validation speed = y, block size = z. It is a no-brainer that if z/x or z/y grows too high, the block orphan probability grows higher and actually approaches 100% as these ratios approach infinity.
Denying this raises the suspicion of trolling.
@_date: 2016-01-10 23:32:37
Ok, I think now I understood our different viewpoint a bit better:
**You think** that any transactions, no matter how little TX fees they have, should be accommodated in blocks ("should" in the sense of "it is desirable for the Bitcoin eco-system" as a whole), as long as there is enough short-term incentive for a miner to do so. In other words: Only if the cost of TX inclusion in the very next block that a miner is about to mine would exceed the incremental gain from adding that given low-fee transaction (due to orphan probability or bandwidth cost for sending out this particular TX, or permanent storage of this few kB TX), the miner should always add all transactions until the mem pool is empty (more or less). In this situation (which is the base of your view) I agree with your statement that typically *"there will be no that many transactions to fill the block size fully"*. And you would probably call such miner behaviour, as I just described it, "economically rational" and "smart". I would also call it "economically rational", but I wouldn't call it "smart" ("smart" in the same sense as it is *not* necessarily smart when a hotel gives a $200/night room to a last minute guest at 11pm for only $50 when the room would otherwise remain empty. Even though economically rational (short term profit maximization, I assume flex costs are &lt;&lt; $50), not smart, because in the long-term that could spoil the market of hotel business revenues).
It is very clear that such economical incentive structure for miners, as described in last paragraph, will cause TX prices go down *extremely*, and in the end miner revenues will get reduced, and as a result miners switch off, hash rate reduces, implying that the Bitcoin system becomes more and more insecure. Miners could only change this trend if they somehow "self-limited" themselves (all rules for everyone) from only profit-optimizing for the short-term (=for the very next block), by setting thresholds/agreement/however-you-call-it to avoid price runs towards diminishing fees. Because many Bitcoin market participants would well be ready to pay 2 cents TX fee, but if they can get the same service for 0.5 cent, they will not pay 2 cent voluntarily. So we need a rule structure to get back to the 2 cent point (but not to the $2 point though! - this would drive users away to competing systems and not benefit the Bitcoin eco-system!). I am offering a solution for this.
**My view** is that the miners should have a means (provided by the protocol rules of course) that optimizes their long-term profits by imposing such limits, in a way that is **independent (i.e. not in conflict)** with the short-term (=per block) optimization - as simple as that. Only then the miners are even allowed(!) to be "smart" in all respects, because they do not have to make compromises between different optimizations targets and are not subject to game theoretical considerations for which no objective optimum solution exists. 
So you can call it "fee market" if you want, that I want to be established, but I do not even remotely arrive at the extreme views observable in many core devs views, and especially such fee market will only establish itself in the far future when mining rewards have dropped considerable - and by that time hopefully the Bitcoin system is big enough in terms of volume (block size, TX/sec) such that moderate TX fees can replace today's block rewards and Bitcoin is still stable and secure. While some "small blockists" want to enforce a "radical" fee market by enforcing small block size limits, I want a fee market that also works with block size limits, but where the block size limit height is found by economical forces rather than by ideological view of programmers.
Our different views also explain to some extend **different views on mem pool occupancies** (whether there are *"that many transactions to fill the block size fully"*, as you say):
In "your model", the mem pool will typically be rather empty most of the time after a block has been mined, because the miner will typically include (almost) all, also extremely low-fee TX, up until the point where fees are uneconomically *for this particular block*.
In "my model", a block size limit is in place at any given point in time, and the fee market (which exists in either model) will converge to higher (but still far from prohibitive) fees then in your model. Miners will of course include the highest fee TXs first, until the respective block hits its max size. Other TXs remain in the mem pool. This way, low fee TXs are not typically included in the very next block(s). However, sometimes, two (or more) blocks are mined shortly one after another (it happens due to Poisson probabilities), or sometimes there are times with less new TXs being generated. A block that is mines during such times will include also the lower fee TXs from the mem pool that former blocks have been rejecting. So in my model it is very typical that the mem pool is never really empty, because many low-prio (=low fee) TXs reside in the mem pool as a kind of backup "buffer". So it is much more typical in my model that blocks can actually be filled more or less all the time. This is why I did not spend too much effort about the minority of blocks that are not really full.
*Edit: To add on complexity:*
*OK, it is a matter of perception what is complex or not. I consider my proposal sill "KISS enough" if it brings a sustainable solution. It appears like a very elegant solution to me with much lower complexity than some explicit voting mechanisms (BIP100/100.5), while still being able to achieve essentially the same thing, plus the added feature that votes are not entirely decoupled from actual block sizes, which is also nice (while short-long-incentive structure IS decoupled, which is very important of course!). Since I am convinced that the "tragedy of the commons" problem must be solved in a sustaining Bitcoin protocol version, I consider my proposal the "KISS-est" way I can think of so far. I agree that any added complexity must be well justifiable, and for this one I see the justifiability absolutely given.*
Question: **What is your vision of the future** *with the "pure" bitpay proposal: Imagine a future world with very high bandwidths everywhere and very huge storage hard drives, and block rewards have dropped to nearly zero. Now from the economical forces, the incremental costs for miners to include an additional TX are extremely low. So the TX fees are also extremely low, as a result of that. My example from above applies: Maybe a typical TX would be 0.5 cent, even though Bitcoin users would readily pay 2 or 3 cent if they had to (and would not run away to VISA or Litecoin). But due to the fee market that establishes is this scenario, we end up with these very low TX fees (lower than what users would be willing to pay), thereby arriving way beyond the point that would maximize Bitcoin miners' revenues. This situation would continue as technology evolves: 0.5 cent --&gt; 0.1 cent, etc., because the incremental costs for TX inclusion become lower and lower. the user base would increase much slower (not 5-fold as TX fees drop from 0.5 to 0.1 cent), because the market is already almost saturated at 0.5 cent. So all that the technology progress gives us is smaller incremental TX block inclusion costs, hence smaller TX fees, hence lower miner revenues, and HENCE(!) CONTINUOUSLY DECREASING BITCOIN NETWORK SECURITY. Soon we will hear some voices saying: "we need another emission schedule, the inflation free model of Bitcoin has failed, it endangers Bitcoin's security". But these voices are wrong of course. In fact, what has failed is the fee market, because the fee market was only driven by technological evolutions coupled with short-term economical incentives, and not by (long-term!) economical optimizations.*

But who defines what is off-topic? If the definition is arbitrary, it is censorship.
We all know that Satoshi himself wrote as early as 2010 that in due time block size limit may be lifted by a hard fork. So this was considered as part of Bitcoin's evolution strategy ever since. Also Satoshi gave Bitcoin a version number &lt; 1.0 and it was labeled "beta" ever since, so also this implies that hard forks (if not in contradiction with original evolution strategy) are considered part of the normal sw and protocol evolution.
Today, some discussions or SW solutions following some of such legit evolution paths are deemed off-topic or attacks by a small minority group of actors.
This is why such acting is perceived as censorship by most people.


The people suggesting certain scaling growth solutions rather consider inaction as an attack to Bitcoin, as tx volums hit the wall. By providing solutions they are defending the network against such attack.
You see, without political bias and without thinking that one's own judgement on certain topics is the only right one, things can be seen in different ways.

No, it's not, sorry for that. There is no "free lunch", face it. As adoption (and hence demand) for Bitcoin increases, TX will get more expensive. You cannot keep up with that by exploding block size - this will break decentralization. Technology grows, but much slower than Bitcoin adoption. We can argue whether 1 MB is the limit where decentralization is endangered, or 2, or 4, or 10 or 20 MB. But for sure it is lower than what you have for a mainstream adopted full p2p system where everybody (many billions) pay their coffee on-chain. Simple math. We have to accept reality. So at SOME point we HAVE to accept that a fully p2p system w/o L2 solutions (incl. LN but also less secure but higher capacity sidechains) need to complement a block size increase, block size increase cannot achive it (until we have a technological breakthrough to afford extremely high storage, capacity and bandwidth for negligible cost to maintain decentralization).
We can argue if this point is now or if we can postpone it a little by block size increase a little. But the PRINCIPLE answer to the PRINCIPLE trade-off does not change by that.
At the *present day* 'I recommend you do buy your coffee with Litecoin, whose TX fee is almost zero like in Bitcoin's early days when it was far away from its capa limit.


Right. This is why I said above we also need side chains as complement. Nevertheless LN (enabled by SegWit) opens a whole new set of use cases and applications that enhances Bitcoin's utility a lot.


I agree. SegWit immediately, LN as well. And further bigger blocks thereafter,cautiously, in balance between demand and growth vs. keeping decentralization. But yes, also grow block size. This what you say is fully in line with bcore roadmap by the way, and against the BU die-hards who are blocking SegWit (fortunately ViaBTC has announced to not block SegWit any more ~~, so I dare to predict that our well-known Bitcoin Judas Lucifer will be amongst the last to block segwit, but this is a non-technically remark, please ignore~~).


I agree. I consider ViaBTC'S step a right step in this direction. Note however that there are probably actors in camouflage whose interest it is to weaken Bitcoin even if they claim otherwise.

Yes, right, I forgot. Then for me this scenario is inaccaptable because your double spend could just as easily defraud the supermarket.




This is completely incomparable, you know it very well, you are smart enough. Credit card fraud is nothing that the laymen can do easily in a supermarket. You need to steal a credit card first, etc. - requires lots of practical criminal effort. On the other hand, double spending with full-RBF is trivial. You jsut need a smartphone app that supports it, i.e. a hacker will fork a common open source bitcoin wallet, offer it as *.apk for installation, and he or anybody can do the double spends easily. As a result, Bitcoin's reputation will go down massively, and it is unusable, and you know it. Of course you will answer LightningNetwork is the solution, but it is not, it should be an option not be inforced. you need to load money on a payment channel, the bitcoins are locked away during the locking period,all this is quite complicated to the laymen and will keep people away from Bitcoin, Bitcoin will remain a niche forever. Of course other coins will overtake Bitcoin than in adoption and consequently also in value.






Come on, you are not naive! Now you are trolling! Technically legitimate double spending and fraud cannot be differentiated - in your supermarket-example with the change address, the network does not know what is the change address and what is the supermarket's address. Saying "he RBF flag has zero relevance to fraud, only legitimate double-spending" assumes that all people are honest, or that Bitcoin shall not be used for direct payments any more. Probably the latter is on your agenda.
I hope you will not succeed, because this will destroy Bitcoin which then will become NicheCoin. I suggest you pursue these ideological experiments which go completely against the original intentions of Bitcoin with a suitable altcoin - this would be perfectly ok. But changing the social contract for Bitcoin one-sided against the community (who are also stakeholdes - not only developers are) is not acceptable.

Note: About my solution proposal above (=modification of bitpay's proposal), one may raise the concern that now there is no TX-Fee-imposed incentive to mine blocks larger than BSL/2. That is true, short-term (for the present block to be mined) there wouldn't be any extra incentive, because the "excess fees" (=fees attributed to TXs making the block greater than BSL/2) are distributed to random miners instead via kind of "roll-over pool" or however we call this mechanism.
So one would ask: "Why should then a miner ever make blocks greater than BSL/2, if there is no immediate incentive. All a block greater than BSL/2 would do is that it would make the orphaning probability of my block slightly higher. So now there is a net negative incentive that hampers block size growth!"
My reply to this would be:
Strictly short-term thinking, yes. But as long as we talk about order of magnitudes in terms of block sizes that are small for the given bandwidth (propagation speed) and CPU technology (validation times), we are talking about very small orphaning probabilities. E.g. an orphaning rate increases from 1.0 to 1.1% or so. (And from this disadvantage we still have to subtract that effect that the miner can earlier start mining on the next block N+1 (assuming that block N will not get orphaned), so the miner himself has an advantage for the next block in 99% of the cases, which offsets the original orphaning probability [more studies probably subject to research]. But this is only a side remark.)
But if the miner is of the opinion that larger block sizes than the current ones will be beneficial for the eco-system as a whole on the mid-/long-term, he will be well willing to be (very very slightly) altruistic in that he mines a larger block to express his "vote" for increased block size limits, and except marginally higher orphan risk!
Further it should be noted that he does not need to generate a block of size equal to "current BSL" and thereby vote for BSL="2 times current BSL". For a sustaining blocksize limit increase of e.g. 30% p.a. and assuming bitpay-protocol makes a BSL adaptation every 2 weeks (2016 blocks), it would be sufficient if the miner voted for a block size limit of only 1.01 times current_BSL, i.e. he increases his block size only by 1%, not 100%, beyond that point where his TX fee revenues from this block no more increase. But for a block size increase of only 1%, the increase of orphaning rate is even smaller and really virtually negligible, and this will in this case really be offset by the positive effect of this miner's long-term contribution to adapt the block size towards a value that improves the eco-system's operational point (and thereby also his own revenues) mid- to long-term!
Of course one could design some "compromise" into my proposal such as to say: Do not send all "excess fees" (=what is beyond BSL/2) to the rollover pool, but only 90% of them, and send 10% of these excess fees still to the miner himself, in order to offset the increased orphaning rate. This idea can be debated of course - it would still be better, much more sustainable, then today's bitpay's proposal. However, the choice of the "10%" is somewhat arbitrary. I think anything between 0% and 10%" of "excess fees" going to the miner directly would be debatable and is certainly better than 100% (=today's bitpay proposal). However, based on what I said in the previous paragraph, I think it is safe to say that 0% is reasonable, and clean, and the short-term dis-incentive for blocks larger than BSL/2 (thereby preventing vote for larger blocks) is really negligible and compensated by a possible long-term incentive.
Hope I am not only talking to myself and you guys can follow my thoughts and my terminology.

But all the rest of the world would still call it "milk", even if they know the product is quite artificial. I would not benefit to the discussion by always insisting that this is not "milk". Instead I should clarify that everybody understands that different types of products exist, all of which are referred to as "milk", and then move on, and now and then add an adjective like "organic milk" vs "plastic milk", instead of pedantically insisting that people should not call it milk what is industrially post-processed.

It is commonly known and can be read everywhere (incl. the ECB's homepage) how fractional banking works, the set rules are that private banks have to comply to the reserve requirements at a certain time each day and loan M0 money from central bank or other private banks if needed to comply. There is nothing mystical that requires scientific investigation here.
@_date: 2016-01-05 21:56:40
Not exactly true. With fractional reserve raised to 100%, the **PRIVATE banks** can no more create money, true. But the central bank can still create new money of course.
With fractional reserve raised to 100%, the central bank would become the ONLY entity to create money, and the private banks would lose their rights to create money.
Note: The two kinds of money creation we are talking about here, one by central bank and another by private banks, are not the same. Central banks create M0 and private banks create M1. Some even say that the money creation of M1 by private banks is not even money. But according to common definitions of terms, M1 is money, just not "true" money, only M0 is true money, while M1 is debt money (well actually also M0 is debt money, but debt towards central bank, not private bank...).

[Part 2 of 2] (Part 1 is [here](
Finally I'd like to illustrate the situation by a concrete examples with numbers (all figures are just examples - not to be taken too literal) - this may clarify the point better than many words:
Imagine that the Bitcoin eco-system has the following parameters at some future point in time (for the sake of explaining the principles, I assume that all TXs have the same fee and that all miners have the same cost structure - the argument in principle still holds for a more realistic situation):
* (a) Market demand for Bitcoin transactions is 8 TX/s for a TX price of 50 cent per TX.
* (b) Market demand for Bitcoin transactions is 100 TX/s for a TX price of 5 cent per TX.
* (c) Market demand for Bitcoin transactions is 300 TX/s for a TX price of 1 cent per TX.
* (d) Market demand for Bitcoin transactions is 1000 TX/s for a TX price of 0.2 cent per TX.
* (e) Market demand for Bitcoin transactions is 1900 TX/s for a TX price of 0.001 cent per TX.
* Due to the state of technology, the incremental cost for including an extra TX into a block is equal to 0.18 cent.
Question: Where would the eco-system converge to, when following economical rules? Answer: It depends on the economical framework. We consider three cases:
* **Framework 1: Free market and many small decentralized mining pools**: Each miner behaves economically rational by maximizing his profits for the very next mined block in a short-term egoistic fashion. So he will include all TXs from the mem pool as long as their fees are higher than his incremental costs of including a TX. Since 0.2 cent &gt; 0.18 cent, he will include even TX as cheap as 0.2 cent TX fee. With this low level of fees we get a market demand of 1000 TX/s. As a result, the eco-system as a whole will generate revenues of 1000 * (0.2-0.18) cent / sec = $0.20 / sec (from this the fixed-cost still have to be subtracted).
* **Framework 2: Same as framework 1, but the miners have a tool to optimize long-term revenues (my proposal)**: Each miner operator is aware of the situation acc. to (a) - (e) from market research. Hence the miners agree (via blocksize limit vote, physical meet-up or whatever) to limit the block size such that the network capacity is "artificially" constrained to 100 TX/s. This will raise the TX fee on the market to 5 cent/TX. As a result, the eco-system as a whole will generate revenues of 100 * (5.0-0.18) cent / sec  = $4.82 / sec  (from this the fixed-cost still have to be subtracted).
* **Framework 3: Free market, but one mining pool has 100% of hash power (monopol)**: Here the miner is no longer pushed to make short-term (and thus short-sighted) decisions. Since he IS the eco-system, he can make long term strategic decisions and set the minimum fee that he is willing to accept to a value well above his incremental costs per TX, if he thinks this is beneficial long-term for him. So he comes up with the same result as in framework 2: He selects 5 cents /TX and he will thus generate revenues of 100 * (5.0-0.18) cent / sec  = $4.82 / sec  (from this the fixed-cost still have to be subtracted).
Note 1: I am omitting the fixed costs, because they are the same for all cases and hence irrelevant for the purpose of comparison.
Note 2: The effect of increasing Bitcoin price for higher TX/s capacity (=higher utility) is neglected in above example. It would in practice push the optimum network capacity towards slightly higher values, as long as block-rewards are non-negligible.

bitcoin laundry means that you disconnect your old coins from your new coins on the blockchain. How? Like that:
- Your old address: A1
- Other people's addresses who also want to launder: B1, C1, D1, ..., Z1.
- The laudry service's addresses where the 26 people send their bitcoins to: A2, B2, ..., Z2.
- You send your bitcoins from A1 to A2.
- Another user sends from B1 to B2, etc.
- The laundry service sends bitcoins (the same amount you sent from A1, minus a fee) from B2/C2/D2/.../Z2 to your new address "Anew".
--&gt; Now, if someone observes the blockchain, he sees no link at all between addresses A1 and Anew. One could infer only indirectly that a laundry had happened, e.g. by looking at time stamps and amounts. But that's gonna be difficult..., the bigger the laundry service is.

In fact, it works even better in the current situation without ETF and only 20 Billion market cap than for a future situation with ETF and a much higher market cap, because "they" need to put much more money in their hands in order to move the market price by a certain percentage.

Look at Spanish history for example. At that time Gold was money.
Spain brought home LOTS of gold from South America and was very rich. But they did not hoard the gold. Had they just hoarded the gold, they would have been rich only in their vaults, but with no impact on their style of living.
So, of course, what happened is that they spent the gold. As a logical result, their gold became less and less. Now others possessed the gold, while they, the spanish, possessed wealth in the form of armies, palaces, infrastructure. But this wealth faded away. After some time there was nothing left. This kind of wealth doesn't last forever if you spend it.
Fiat money is working according to completely different principles. It is issued by central banks as loan for interest and the debtors have to pay it back plus interest. This does not work, because the interest was never put into existence. So it is not possible for everybody to pay it back. Even if all market participants are very dilligent, some will always lose. They will have to take new loans to be able to pay back the old loans, or at least the interest of it. The rich class remains rich, because they have the power over the money and have the money slaves work for them, and they (those "slaves") do not even realize it, that the interest is the evil thing. They jsut get told "you are not good enough". But it lies in the nature of the system that always some are not good enough and end-up as money-slaves, even if all are very dilligent. This is the characteristics of the interest based fiat money system. No resemblence to bitcoin.
Bitcoin resembles Gold in this respect and hence guarantees wealth distribution after some time - at least when you define wealth as Bitcoin. Maybe other systems are set up that create slaves again, systems of jurisdiction next to Bitcoin. But the currency Bitcoin will not be part of such an evil system, because it is intrinsically leveling out wealth over time.

Whether something gets allowed or disallowed should not be dependent on whether it is a hard fork, but on whether it is in agreement with Bitcoin's original ideas, its social contract. (Also note that at version numbers below 1.0 hard-forks are still very normal and do not constitute any violation of a social contract.)
The criterion for what bitcoin.org should disallow should be whether a policy is in line with the original idea of Bitcoin (=its social contract or Bitcoin's original promise) or whether it stands against it and causes a dangerous change of the original ideas, or in other words, whether it breaks the social contract about what Bitcoin was promised to be ever since.
* Since Bitcoin was always designed for an emission and block reward schedule and the finite supply as we know it now, any change that changes that block reward schedule (maybe except a change that just smoothes out the block reward reductions instead of having disrupting halvings every 4 years, without changing the total number of BTC mined or the general emission schedule) would constitute a violation of the social contract. So bitcoin.org should not allow such policies. This is a no-brainer.
* Policies that increase block size limits should be allowed, because they are answers to scaling necessities that exist in reality and cannot be talked away (not even by censoring solution proposals for this problem). Even Satoshi mentioned already in 2010 a hard-fork as a solution to the 1 MB limit at a later point in time. Clearly, such a solution is not at all against Bitcoin's social contract. If anything, ignoring this would break this contract .
* From all block size evolution strategies, the one that is most in contradiction to the original ideas of Bitcoin is the strategy of keeping 1 MB. So if anything should be disallowed, then it is advertisement of this strategy, which is a clear violation of Bitcoin's social contract! But I would suggest to not even censor this, but to keep the discussions free.

Hello goldcakes wrote:


Yes. Flexcap means more precisely that a miner who wants to mine a block greater than the current "nominal" block size limit has to achieve a higher difficulty than what is the current "nominal" difficulty. This "punishes" and disincentivises block limit increases pretty much. Note that a miner has to decide upfront what kind of block he is mining for: Example: Current 'nominal' difficulty threshold=2000. Miner decides to mine for a larger block, such that a higher difficulty with threshold=1800 applies. Now while mining and hashing, if he happens to create a hash=1900, that's bad luck. He cannot just say now *"oh ok, I change my mind and will broadcast this block as 'normal' block now with hash=1900 satisfying the nominal threshold of 2000."* So unless tx fees are really high, this flexcap will not be enough incentive for making mining larger blocks (incorporating extra transactions) economical.
To be honest, also bitpay's proposal includes a magic constant, which is the fixed multiplier for the hard limit, i.e. if a miner creates a block of actual size 2MB, this is automatically interpreted by the (bitpay proposal's) protocol as a vote for a block size limit of 4MB (assuming fixed multiplier=2). But this is not necessarily the miner's intention. The miner might be perfectly happy with 2MB and creates a 2MB block to collect all the tx fees, but a general sustaining 4MB block size limit (and actual blocksizes correspondingly high) might be too much for this miner to handle. So this miner, if he wanted to express his opinion via this "implicit voting mechanism", had to mine a block of only 1MB size, equating to a vote for 2MB bl.sz.limit. But this means he would loose (forego) revenues from tx fees.
So to summarize:
* While flexcap punishes large blocks that are greater than current nominal block size limit,
* bitpay's proposal punishes (implicit) votes for block sizes &lt; "2 times current block size limit" (if hard coded "hard limit" multiplier==2.
But I already have an idea how bitpay's drawback can be improved: By adding a simple mechanism similar to the **rollover fees**, inspired by [Meni Rosenfeld's proposal]( Explanation - further assuming that hard multiplier=2: Introduce the following modification: The transaction fees for the first "blockSizeLimit/2" MB go directly to the miner of block "N", as usual. The tx fees for transactions beyond that do not go to this miner directly, but go to a "rollover pool" and get paid out to future miners acc. to a certain schedule to be defined (even simpler: could also get paid out to a previous block's miner "N-delta", where delta (out of 1..12096 or so) is randomly calculated from the block hash). This would reduce the disincentive for voting for blockSizeLimits &lt; 2*currentBlockSizeLimit, it would remove the "tragedy of commons" problem of bitpay's proposal.
[In this post of mine]( I comment further on this problem of bitpay's proposal.

That is not a bad plan, and it is very close to "we start with segwit as it is offered now resulting in 2MB equivalent capacity and all the L2 channels we want, and do on-chain scaling further later-on".
I cannot understand the reason for blocking today's solution because of this tiny difference. It keeps all options open to achieve "segwit+bigger blocks" later on, no door is closed by doing segwit only in a first step. A freeze of progress, as we see it now, is much worse.
I cannot understand why people who say "I want A and B", prefer "neither A nor B" (=status quo) over "A now, B later". This is just stubborn or politically motivated.

Well, if a miner mines a block that is very large, his block needs longer to propagate and to get validated by other miners, which is a pre-condition for other miners to mine on top of this block. if another miner still mines on the previous block and then finds a competing block that is smaller, that block will propagate and get validated faster, such that our first miner's large blick gets orphaned.
in brief: the larger the block, the greater the probability that it won't get into the longest chain and the miner looses the block completely. So every miner will be incentivised to find the best optimum block size to maximize its profits, and certainly the optimum is at a certain finite MByte value.

if ETF gets approved, 100s of Millions flow into Bitcoin, pushing price well above 2000, maybe &gt; 3000. So an efficient and rational market must price this in weighted with the probability of this event occurring.
Example:    
Price without ETF = $800,    
Price with ETF = $2500,    
probability of approval = 30%
yield a price before ETF approval decision of

I think you are wrong here (it has been explained by others 100000 times and you still "think" hf is better...)


it is!
today:    
legacyBlocksize &lt;= 1MB
with SegWit:    
4 x legacyBlocksize + witnessDataBlockSize &lt;= 4 Mb.
So witness data is part of the size limit formula. (hope we don't argue about terminology)
(and there is good reason for the discount, was also explained plenty of times, read it if you are honestly interested)


Without a voting mechanism BU is a very bad idea because large miners would lead the way and small miners would have to follow to avoid mining on orphaned chain. Very bad new paradigm, the opposite of decentralization. Opens up many means of manipulations outside of the realm of the technical protocol level. very very bad. This problem is not raised enough in the discussions but replaced by unscientific ideology that somehow the market magically finds the right size, hiding the concrete problems it brings when looking at it in detail. Surely, big miners have an interest not to get this raised.

WRONG! The opposite is true.

Conversely, no scenario exist in which a segwit block violates legacy rules, so any SegWit block is accepted by all legacy nodes.

I also find this proposal interesting and worth considering. However I don't think it is a mix of BIP-100 and BIP-101. I think the best mix of those two BIPs is [BIP-100.5](
There is also another BIP proposal in this author's github repositories called [BIP-10X]( which is more complicated and also takes the blocks actual sizes into consideration, similarly to bitpay's proposal.
As usual, all proposals have pros&amp;cons. Bitpay's proposal shines for its simplicity. However, it may suffer the "**tragedy of the commons**", because actual block sizes themselves *are* the miner votes. This may lead to the following situation:
A miner would *generally* prefer to *keep* the current block size limit as it is (at least for a while), because of his own judgement of the eco-system's situation, his bandwidth, etc. So he prefers that the block size limit shall not increase too much too quickly. However, when it comes to mining an *actual* block, his economical incentive structure in this concrete situation is very short-term and he will be incentivised to fill this block completely to maximize short-term miner fees.
Now, by filling this block completely he has automatically casted a vote to raise the future block size limit by two (fixed x2 multiplier in the protocol for the hard limit). So he is in conflict! If he wanted to cast a vote for "keep current block size limit" he had to create a block whose size is only 50% of the current block size limit, but then he would stay 50% below what he considers optimum himself. So whatever he does, it is not in his best personal interest, he is **forced to make a compromise between his own short- and long-term interests** because of the way the protocol rules are defined (i.e because he **cannot decouple long-term voting from short-term optimization**).
An analogy to this "tragedy of commons" conflict of own interests is e.g. standards of environmental protection: In short term, a company (or even a whole state) may be interested to *not* increase such standards, because it is a burden that costs money and hence reduces profits and hence reduces wages and hence living standards of the company's owners/the state's population. However, generally everybody wants to live in a more healthy environment and is willing to pay for it if the other participants in the economy do the same. So they can cast a vote for a green party in the next elections to achieve this while continuing their daily profit-oriented business as usual, and once new laws pass the legislation, every economic participator (and competitor) abides to these rules equally.
I think the analogy to Bitcoin is crystal clear and valid, and therefore my opinion is that it is better to decouple short term and long term optimization by including an element of voting (either like bip-100.5, or including actual block size as a constraint in voting like in bip-10X). *EDIT: [Here I proposed a simple improvement]( to bitpay's proposal to eliminate the "tragedy of the commons" problem.*
Not decoupling this is like saying: "We don't need stronger environmental laws, because if people (incl. factory owners) want to breath fresher air, they can simply install filters themselves. And if they don't install exhaust gas cleaning filters volontarily this equates to a vote against stronger environmental laws. So we don't need separate elections, because people are already voting implicitly by the way they behave." - and clealy, this does not work, as explained.

The problem though is that a miner who is "too progressive" can never be sure if his (bigger) block will be accepted by other miners or get orphaned (unless it has been ensured by (secret?) talks between mining pool leaders that blocks up to x MB will be accepted by anyone. This is not the open system I want Bitcoin to be. Hence I definitly prefer to have a blocksize limit defined by the protocol's mechanisms.
From what I understood, bitpay's line of argument goes in the same direction.

* More "KISS" than opt-in full-RBF, because no needs for two kinds of transactions, no need for TX flags, no need for merchants to implement new scenarios for the case of receiving a 0-conf Full-RBF-flagged opt-in transaction.

correct - no disagreement.


both options are unsafe for different reasons:
one because it breaks consensus rules, the other because it is the shorter chain.
I consider the former much more risky.
if the market values stability of decentralization higher than cheap fees, it will value legacy coins higher than bu fork, which reduces profit of bu miners.
So clearly, the market decides, not the miners.
the speed degradation ("crippling") is only temporary and hence not so important for long term investment considerations by the market.

Hello coinradar,
thanks for reading my (long) post. I think we largely think along the same lines, and me too I find bitpay's proposal very attractive (maybe the most attractive) for its simplicity and effectiveness. And this is the reason why I am spending so much time for it here in the first place: I would like to see it adopted! But with a small but as I think really really important modification, which should not change the characteristics of how bitpay's proposal is intended to work in the network.
I think you (and also Peter__R by the way) have not appreciated enough the inherent conflict between the different (!) **short-term** and **long-term economical optimization functions**, both of which are economical realities that need to be taken into account for a complete economical modelling of the system. This is at the core of my argument, and others refer to this as the "tragedy of the commons", but I prefer the more direct wording "short-term vs. long-term conflict". I encourage everyone to think this through by him/herself and to understand what I mean by this. Otherwise any further discussion is meaningless, because this is the ONLY reason for my amendment proposal.
I think that most people who take the "free market" argument [which is a correct argument as such] make the implicit assumption that the SHORT-term decisions that an economical player makes for a certain market variable (here the "block size") is automatically the best long-term decision for the eco-system as a whole. But this, I am sure, is a fallacy, and not only are there plenty of examples and theories, but everybody can also understand this oneself when leaning back and thinking deeply about it. I have elaborated on it a lot [incl. parallels to ecological laws, in case it can be better understood this ways]. Another example from the real world with some analogy is "cheap free hotel rooms": A hotel is not fully booked. Normal prices are 200 USD per night. I come along at 10:00 pm and say: "I would take a room for 80 USD, otherwise I move on." What should the hotel do? If it acted short-term, it would give me the room for 80 USD, this maximizing short-term profits, because the flex-costs of me having the room are only 10 USD for cleaning and usage, if at all.) But long term, this would be a bad decision for the hotel, because I would tell all my friends about this trick and in the future the hotel would have more and more short-term low-paying guests and less normal paying guests, i.e. the economical short-term rational decision destroys the eco-system long-term. Hotels are smart enough to know this and to avoid accepting the 80 USD offer too often. But would miners be similarly smart? I very much doubt it, I think they will only see and optimize for short-term optimization.
The problem is: **If a miner decides, acc. to absolutely free-market decisions, that his short-term (=for this individual block) gain is maximized for BSL=X, there is no economical connection that says that a block size limit that derives from this short-term decision is the best in the long-term for the eco-system as a whole. Hence these two optimizations MUST be decoupled for a Bitcoin solution to be sustainable and healthy, i.e. the economy [here: the miners] must be able to influence these two optimization targets INDEPENDENTLY from each other [from the targets, not from the miners], if possible. And it is very well possible with the corresponding protocol rules.** (sorry for highlighting)
By the way, I have just made a new post [here]( on this topic.
A few short replies/clarifications on your post:


It is not complex. The exact realization is not important and can be driven by what is most simple. One concrete example (but others may have better ideas): The mentioned "excess fees" of block N (if block N's size is &gt; BSL/2) go to the miner of block N +/- delta, where delta is a function of block N's hash, acc. to a pre-defined function. (whether "+" or -" delta: whatever is easier to implement) Or it just gets spread-out over the last 10 blocks, simply. ...


Well, if you look at how the protocol (not myself) treats this, it is treated exactly like a vote. Of course your view is perfectly right, too. But viewing it as a vote is also right. I used the model of the "vote" because by this I thought I could more clearly explain my point of the divergence between long-term and short-term interests that are caused by this mechanism of coupling short-term (per-block) incentives (or profit optimization function) with long-term block size limit evolution. After all, you can call it "block size adaptation mechanism as function of actual block sizes" instead of "vote", it makes no difference for my argument - it is just a matter of personal preferences of how to explain things.
One could argue it is not a "completely free vote", because if memory pool is not full, the miner cannot "vote" for a larger BSL even if he wanted to (neglecting techniques like including self-generated spam transactions to oneself). However, nevertheless I call it vote. Note that due to Poisson distribution statistics one could calculate how big of a fraction of blocks are not full because they are generated too quickly after the previous block... Depending on this result, one might also bias pitpay's "voting threshold" to be not the median (=50% quantile) but some other (higher) quantile, to offset this effect, which would be considered a bias towards lower blocks. On the other hand, one could also "price this in" with the choice of the constant multiplier (=2). Some people can make some research on this, but it doesn't change the main characteristics of the bitpay proposal, so I do not want to elaborate on this here any further - it distracts from the main point.


I don't really want to see my proposal compared with flexcap. Flexcap imposes a real and explicit dis-incentive against mining bigger blocks, and thereby it is clearly biased towards keeping small blocks. Also flex-cap is somewhat arbitrary, because we never know (depending on how much dis-incentive is built into a flex-cap protocol) by how much this flex-cap penalty (higher mining difficulty for larger blocks) would offset/(over)compensate the positive incentive of a larger block due to more collected TX fees. My proposal is much more *direct*, because it works on exactly these TX fees themselves, so no further implicit assumptions are needed.
Another side-remark:


In the first sentence you are raising an interesting point here that I did not have on my (coin)radar myself: Mining a bigger block is not only a disadvantage for the big-block-miner because of orphaning risk (this is the main argument of the BU supporters and Peter__R), but there is also an advantage from being able to mine on this block earlier. If and how these two effects compensate each other is probably a matter of further research. I remember that the "selfish miners" do exactly this: They hold back their own blocks for a while and get an advantage from this (but it only works if they have at least 33% of hash power I think).

This game theory misses a point: Full RBF (i.e. miners accepting obvious fraudulent  double spends into their blocks) harm the eco-system, remove important use cases, reduce the use of bitcoin and hence its price and thereby harm themselves.

This is also wrong.
* With SegWit I need 4 MB of memory for twice the nb. of TX than today -&gt; WRONG!
* With SegWit I need 1 MB of memory for twice the nb. of TX than today -&gt; WRONG!
* With SegWit I need ca. 2 MB (maybe 2.2) of memory for twice the nb. of TX than today -&gt; CORRECT!
However 1 MB of SEGwit witness data costs the network less than 1 MB of legacy block data, so overall segwit is more efficient than a normal block increase to 2MB would be.

Just because a system was DESIGNED to be decentralized, it doesn't mean it always will.
People have to defend it - otherwise it will be hijacked.
Proclaiming that there is no (cannot be any) leadership because Bitcoin is by design decentralized cannot talk away the fact that there is a de facto leadership elite that legitimatises itself based on its history, coercion and censorship.
People denying this remind me of idealists saying that communism is ruled by the people instead of a technocratic dictatorship (because that's how it was originally designed by the idealists).

[Text too long, so I have to split into two parts]
[PART 1 of 2]
Hello coinradar, thanks for this qualified answer - more of this would be good for this subreddit.
First of all - just for the record/reference - the other posts of mine that I was referring to are:
* [This]( (elaborating on tragedy of commons), and
* [This]( (suggesting adding partial "rollover fee" machanism to bitpay's proposal).
Please read my post slowly and if necessary twice - I think it is really important to understand certain hidden "long-term" pitfalls. (And please do not think I am a "small-blocker" - I am not at all, as should be clear when reading my other posts on reddit. I am balanced an pragmatic in terms of economical and technical consideration in all directions.)










Let's take an example, taken not necessarily from today (with Chinese firewall restrictions etc.), but from any future point in time with any arbitrary geographical split of miners in the world:
Assume I am a miner operator. I have certain bandwidth and CPU costs and restrictions, and there is a certain combination of block rewards and TX fees, and my mining company's market research has extrapolated how TX fees, bitcoin price etc. would evolve under various different scenarious. Now, based on this I want to optimize the revenues (or rather: profits = earnings minus costs) of my business. After putting all input data together, I come to the conclusion that:
* For the next 6 months or so, my business would run most optimum if block size limit ("bsl") remains at 2 MB where it is right now (just an example). For a greater limit (and hence greater avg. blocks that I have to transfer through my fibres and validate in my CPUs etc.) I expect lower income from fees, higher costs for bandwidth, and disadvantages through longer validation times of foreign blocks. Otherwise, 1 MB would lead to increase of TX fees driving users away from bitcoin, causing price pressure, less users etc. So 2 MB is quite optimum for now.
* So I would like to be able to vote for "2 MB". Clearly, since the votes are evaluated by the median (50% quantile) method [which I am a big proponent of by the way], the best I could do to achieve this is to cast a vote for exactly this "2 MB". *Note: Gaming the system by voting overly high or low thereby offsetting other votes makes no sense - this would only work with the averaging method, but not with the median method*. To do this acc. to "the bitpay-protocol's" proposed rules, I have to produce blocks with a size of 2MB / 2 = 1 MB.
* So far for the long-term strategy. Now the short-term strategy:
* As a miner, I am trying to produce blocks myself. Here I a also make calculations to optimize my business: How large should the blocks be in an optimum case (assuming the mem pool is large enough)?  Also now I take all the different input variables into account, but the optimization functions are different ones and naturally I will come up with a different value. For example, bandwidth cost for own blocks (which are generated say once in 4 hours or so depending how big of a miner I am) play less of a role then what foreign blocks contribute. Also the macro-economical impact on user satisfaction etc. is different when considering my own blocks than all blocks, because I am just a small miner with a 1-digit percentage of hash power. Orphaning probabilities as a fucntion of my block size and TX fees also are inputs to this equation. After all, I get to the conclusion that I should mine blocks as large as possible (maybe the "break-even" acc. to this calculation is only at 5 MB, after which orphaning rate starts to limit my profits if I mined even larger blocks).
* Now, since the current bsl is at 2 MB, I will naturally generate full 2 MB blocks if possible, acc. to this short-term profit optimization formulas.
Now the problem is: Since the protocol tightly couples the short-term and the long-term optimization (by the fixed multiplier of "2"), I cannot optimize my short-term profit and my long-term vote at the same time, which is a pity.
Of course above numbers are EXAMPLES. But it should be clear that is would be a big coincidence if both optimization calculations (in combination with the fixed arbitrary multiplier value of "2") yields the same optimum. So by nature of how things are, there will virtually always be a conflict that the short-term optimum (=best size for a self-mined block) does not match the preferred voting behaviour reflecting the best long-term evolution of the system.
We can even have the paradox situation that all miners do the same calculation as I do (let's assume there are 20 pools all having 5% market share, I am one of them), and each of them ends up producing 2 MB blocks (i.e. all optimize the short-term profit) and hope that their vote (since they make up only 5%) is anyway not so relevant. So for each of them individually it is best to optimize the short-term profit and ignore the fact that the vote that they cast by this decision is not exactly what they prefer most. --&gt; As a result, the bsl will increase towards 10 MB, although NONE of the miners actually wanted that to happen. Had they been able to cast a vote for the long-term bsl evolution independently from their short-term profits, they had all voted for a 2 MB block size limit, but the protocol did not allow them to do so. Very much like all the [factories polluting the air]( although all of them would welcome a law acc. to which all factories would be mandated to install exhaust filters - a classical situation for the "tragedy of commons".
I hope this was understandable ?:-)

The chart couldn't be more inviting. Even if BTC market share is bound to fall long-term, the current dip is clearly a market overreaction.
I recommend everyone who has Dash or ETH: Do it now. Dash and ETH cannot hold their valuation vs. BTC - current prices are an exaggeration, take advantage of it, sell now for BTC and buy more ETH (or Dash if you like) from BTC later after ratios have normalized again. I've done so already (not for Dash though, because I never possessed any and am not planning to do so )

No, this is not correct, this CANNOT be correct. The miners should be smart enough to know that Bitcoin is open source software!
If they use and adopt SegWit, which is provided by the Bitcoin-core open source software project today, they are NOT, be any means, forced to continue using bitcoin-core software for the future!!!
They can adopt SegWit now, and if they afterwards want to do a hardfork for larger block, on top of SegWit, they can do it just as easily as they can fork now. Nobody hinders them. The notion, that, if the miners adopt segwit now, they would engage closer with bitcin-core for the future in any particular way, is absolute and obvious bullshit to any clear mind.

Oh, that's easy: raise the prices of the products of the shop, so people will stay away until crowdiness reaches levels of comfort.
In the meantime another shop nextdoor opens with much more floor space and lower prices. Then even the few remaining customers that were willing to pay higher prices will move to that competing store eventually. After a while, these competing store's cheaper products will even turn out to be better (have more utility) than the original products, as more and more people switch over.
Eventually, the old store runs out of business, and its owners still don't understood why people (customers) behaved economically rational instead of in line with old shop's owners' biased ideologies.

if the cashier were educated (which is of course an unrealistic assumption) he would return the RBF-flagged payment to the client (minus network tx fees of course) and request the customer to pay again, but this time non-rbf.
in a corresponding online payment scenario, the receiver immediately returns the amount to one of the input addresses (1) and displays a message "payment rejected and returned to address 1sjhifxbhscbdvgdjydcjdg, retry with non-rbf payment, please!"
(1) I know that *generally* return to input address is a bad practice, because the payer might not be in control of that address in case he is paying from a hosted wallet service. However, in case of returning Full-RBF tagged transactions, it is a perfectly suitable practice. Reason:
* if the payer is in control of his private keys, it is anyway ok, he gets the paynent returned (minus tx fee as "penalty" for having used the wrong method)
* if the payer is not in control of the private keys of the input addresses of the payment because he uses a hosted wallet service, then it is up to the hosted wallet service to refund him the bitcoins. After all, this hosted wallet service allowed the client to opt-in for Full-RBF payments in the first place, so it should also implement processes to give him a refund in case that a full rbf payment is "returned to sender". It's the responsibility of this hosted wallet service, not the poor cashier's responsibility, to make sure this plays out well.

kind of over interpretation you are doing here, i think bitcoin emission schedule is not the topic (and never should).
most people pleading block size increase do it because they want to preserve Bitcoin's original concept which is endangered by inaction wrt blocksize (remember, already in 2010 satoshi suggested lift of bs limit in due time via some hard fork and labelled the 1MB temporary). unfortunately most people pleading to keep the blocksize also do this with the intention of keeping Bitcoin's original concept. Both sides think the other side is wrong. And both sides even think that the other side has bad intentions. That's the dilemma.
When it comes to emission schedule, there is no question that a change is not debatable. Both mentioned groups would certainly stand united on this question.

Then DO THE FORK if you think it works this way, and don't just talk about it.
I am sure no miner majority, not even 99%, can impose (enforce/coerce) new consensus rules or block progress against the will of the market majority, because if market doesn't buy their new coins, they are doomed. A very simple no-brainer.

this is a rethorical question, right?
@_date: 2016-01-08 23:59:29
Hmm, so the main concern is the short term peaks, that bitpay's proposal cannot handle. My opinion is that such short-term-peaks should be handled via TX fees, the other transactions then have to wait a bit. And hopefully the completely uncritical FSS(!)-RBF and CPFP are supported by that time for all transactions as standard.
The bottleneck would not stay forever, because bitpay's auto-adaptation mechanism will take care that system capacity adapts, so we are not stuck in a "small-blocker's trap" and have no fee-market dreamer's "permenantly small blocks with excessive TX fees".
What I don't like about BU (bitcoin without any protocol-wise defined block size limit) - and I said it several times at various occasions today and over the recent months - is that miners CEOs/CTOs would have to agree what they will be willing to accept as max. block size for the time to come. While this "could" perhaps work, it is much better to build this mechanism into the system, because then it is formalized, avoids arguments and heated debates if miner CTOs cannot agree in their regular meetups, and does not leave small miners (who are not invited to the big miner's meetups) aside.. The meetup between the CTO is factually nothing different than voting anyway. So if we are honest, BU implies that voting happens as a matter of fact (because someone has to "decide" in your example that the max accepted size that will not get orpahned by the mining community is raised form 17 to 20 MB), just not voting in the protocol, but rather invisibly in secret. That's not where I want Bitcoin to be.
But if we accept anyway that voting takes place, it is better to include it into the protocol, like in bitpay's proposal, or like in BIP-100 (or the improved and much-preferred but rarely mentioned [BIP-100.5]( or [BIP-10X]( (which also contains a short term overload treatment by the way) from the same author as bip-100.5, or others.

I think the wikipedia article should be amended to acknowledge that it is unknown today whether satoshi or flickr invented base58 first, and reasearch could not come to a conclusion. So it must be accepted as an open question. It is also well possible that it was invented independently at around the same time. After all, the idea to introduce base58 from a reduced alphabet of base64 after omitting 0O1I+/ is not so far-fetched, and the use cases for both flickr and Bitcoin are fairly obvious.

From what I read, my impression is that the vast majority understands well the *theoretical* insecurity of 0-conf transactions, just as well as the *practical* de-facto security of 0-conf transactions (and the de-facto wide use if it).
These people do not welcome a change that reduces this *practical de-facto* security, and this is not well understood by the mathematicians who have problems with reality and mainly argue in terms of theory.
It seems that these mathematicians want their world to become more "consistent" by changing the system such that reality comes closer to theory. And by this they are willing to accept adverse practical implications.

Reason: Assume I want to spend 0.5 BTC to address B.
In normal wallets, the wallet takes the 3 BTC from both UTXOs together and generates a TX with 0.5 BTC to B and 2.5 BTC to my own change address C.
With coin control per UTXO I could just send from my first UTXO 0.5 BTC to B and 0.5 BTC to C. The other 2 BTC on A remain untouched.
So in the second case the generated TX would be smaller, because no unnecessary garbage/dust collection is made which increases TX size and hence tx fees.

I see many good arguments against  blockstream and in favor of a decentralized censorship-free bitcoin developer community.
I don't see any good argument in your post, I only see simple propaganda and conspiracy theories in your post. I am neither stupid nor part of an anti-blockstream conspiracy, but you will probably deny this, and this proves my theory right.
There are plenty of good arguments against blockstream's policy, they have been named 1000 times, for those who read with open eyes.
If you don't want to see this, the fact that blockstream or coredevs behave as if they alone know the truth and are not publicly and VERY clearly distancing themselves from censorship in their names and the people doing this censorship is alone a good reason to be weary.

Please explain (I want to learn):
After a SegWit softfork, how are full nodes running today's legacy SW are going to validate blocks and transactions if this SW is not aware of SegWit?
Common sense and logic says: They cannot fully validate, because they don't have the full information. Then can't there theoretically be a fork in the way that legacy nodes consider a block as valid that the new SW nodes consider invalid when looking at the full information?
If yes, why is this called a soft fork then.
And then, why is a softfork a good thing?

the "legitimate reasons" you are mentioning can be done with fss-rbf, and this is not what i would call a double-spend (because the first outputs do not get reduced). allowing full-rbf for this is shooting over the goal, or  "pouring out the child with the bath water" as I like to say, i.e. causes more harm than benefit (no extra benefit over fss-rbf).
about what us an "illusion" as you say - let the narket decide. currently the illusion works extremely nicely, as many merchants report that zero-conf double spend attacks are not or almost not observed and much liwer than CC fraud or shop lifting losses. So let's benefit the eco system from this de-facto reality (even if it is a "cannot be dream" in strict theory) as long as possible and benefit from it to bitcoin's growth and adoption instead of accelerating/fostering stopping of this use case prematurely.

That latter ***is*** cashing out.
Currently, it means converting btc to fiat cash (hence the term) in order to later buy goods and services from fiat to improve your quality of life.
The term "cash" out is obsolete already today and shouldn't be taken literally, because already today you usually receive electronic money via wire transfer (i.e. a liability to your bank) rather than actual cash.
Later, the intermediate step via fiat might be unnecessary. The term "cash out" is still used for historical reasons. But it can be replaced by "goods&amp;services-out" to avoid misunderstandings of what is actually meant.

That's no different from my understanding of your view. Miners make their own decision based on economical optimization: Incremental cost per TX in the own block vs. profit per TX included in own block must yield a positive profit.


I agree. You misunderstood me on this. For the debate to stay factual, we should try not to misquote each other. I didn't say that miners will include all arbitrarily low fees in "your scenario". On the contrary, I mentioned instead explicitly the incremental costs of including a TX as the criterion for the minimum fee needed to be included in a certain block. And I said that naturally, as technology evolves further, these incremental costs (and thereby also the TX fees) can only decrease. I did not say that incremental costs would become zero, so zero fees TXs would never be included by an economically rational miner. But very (not arbitrarily) low-fee TXs would.


I agree and I never meant to say anything contrary to that. But I thought a step further and explained the differences between short and long term incentives, while you always talk about only "incentives" (which from the context correspond to my "short-term incentives"). Although you said in an earlier post that you recognized my argument of short- vs. long-term incentives, I don't think you understood my argument. Because otherwise you would address this argument, by either agreeing with it or picking it up and explaining where you think it is incorrect. But instead, what you do is explaining *your* system view in complete disregard of these two (short- vs. long-term) incentives. I am sorry for this, but this way our conservation brings nothing new, already now I am mainly repeating myself and am rephrasing what I have already said. But no worries!


Sure. I never said the costs are zero. I just said they continuously decrease with technological progress.


(...yes, so lets say "smaller and smaller costs, approaching say incrementally 1 satoshi per TX or even less"...)


(...of course not. I never said they would. You are completely talking past my arguments. Maybe you just misunderstood me, admittedly my posts were very long and I might have missed to find the right balance between focus on the one hand and elaboration on the other hand...)


Exactly. You are perfectly explaining the "short-term" incentives that I was talking about.


I clarify: You are saying: "Let the market of *SHORT-term incentives* decide the equilibrium parameters." That's the starting point (not the end-point) of my argument that a market that is driven by these short-term incentives alone ends up with fees (and hence overall miner revenues) that are much lower than what is optimum for the health (profitability) of the eco-system.
 






These figure were meant to be illustrative examples to make my principle point clear in few words. Don't take the 0.5 cent or 2 cent figures too literal.


I fully agree with this "side" (or case) of the scenario - i.e. the case where technology (like bandwidth etc.) is not [yet] ready to provide huge TX/s capacity, so TX fees would increase. This would be no different in my model. Because in this case the optimum TX fee acc. to short-term incentive (or in other words: the incremental costs for TX inclusion into a block) would be the limiting factor for the blocks size, and not the long-term incentives.


Exactly. And this is where I continued to visualize where this situation leads to (and again I am repeating myself): Incremental costs of inclusion of a TX into a block decrease over time from $15 over $2 to 2 cent to 0.5 cent to 0.1 cent... [just example(!) figures!]. With the self-regulating market incentive structure in place in your model, every miner will incorporate almost(!) all TX fees up to(!) these lower and lower limits [of course some will draw the line at 0.1 cent, others at 0.3 cent - not all are exactly the same, but this makes no difference in principle]. These limits are so low because technology has improved so much.


Exactly right, up to the point where you say *"[...] need to close mining"*. Then you are a little too quick in your next half-sentence and miss exactly the point that I was making. Re-think: Why do you think other miners would then suddenly adjust TX fees upwards again in this case (in your scenario). The incentive structure has not changed just because some miners have closed. Still the incremental cost of inclusion of a TX into a block is the same as it was before the other miners have closed down. So the minimum TX fee for which it is economical to include a TX into a block is the same as before, so there is no market force that would suddenly drive fees up again.
This is exactly where my long-term incentive mechanism comes into play: If there is a mechanism in place by which the miners can have a mutual agreement to limit the block size of every single block, they create a scarcity of the network's TX/s capacity. By this we end-up at TX/s capacity "B" instead of "A", with B&lt;A.


That is always the basic misconception about my proposal: Proponents of the "free market ideal" think that I am introducing some extra rules that stand against the *free market*, and are hence *uneconomical* and cannot give the *best result* for the eco-system. They think that always "simpler is better" in terms of play of market forces. But this view is too simplified, because when we make the real effort to think the whole thing through, we see that the "free market", without such rules, cannot be economical, even if it wants to. Because it is in the conflict between short- and long-term optimization. **Only by giving the free market a TOOL to optimize the long-term incentives independently from the short-term incentives, the market actors can really behave truly economical.**

I think you are talking past me here when it comes to rollover fees.
I did not talk about 0 TX blocks or so, and I cannot relate what you are writing to what I was writing.
I talked about a mechanism by which under certain conditions a certain fraction of the TX fees (between 0 and 50% of the TX fees of that block) of a mined block are not attributed to the miner but instead distributed to other miners mining blocks somewhere before or after that block.
*This idea got inspired by Meni Rosenfeld, but I apply it to bitpay's proposal in a modified way, so if your comment was somehow directly related to some proposal from Meni Rosenfeld, then this may explain our disconnect here. I do not intend to discuss any Meni Rosenfeld solution here, I just wanted to acknowledge Meni's work/idea and therefore mentioned him.*

But there are very good arguments for everyone who acknowledges that
1. Bitcoin's value comes to a great extend from it's utility, and
2. that its utility is correlated to its network effect, and
3. that the network effect is limited by a limit of the network transaction volume (max. nb. of tx per day), and
4. that a block size limit is limiting the transaction volume.
That's what it comes down to. Anybody denying any of the above points is mentally sick or at least not logical or has a disorder of common sense in my view.
ps: small block ideologists typically ignore this utmost obvious chain of argument, knowing there's nothing to say against it. instead they distract with other things, although everyting is said with these few sentences. This is what makes me a headache and very sad for Bitcoin.

The title is more than hypothetical - it is simply impossible. Reason is very straight forward:

I am curious to see what happens if miners mine blocks that have no value, because exchanges and users (=stakeholders that some here consider NOT part of the eco system) don't accept them. Miners can either be stubburn and keep on mining their worthless coins at a loss (because nobody attributes value to them except the miners themselves, so they can buy them from each other for $1300/coin *lol*), or they can decide to mine on that chain that is also fully compatible to their consesus rules but has value and is accepted by the rest of the eco system.
In this latter case, miners would behave rational, egoistic, and serve the whole eco systen, all at the same time, as it should be the case in Bitcoin's incentive structure.
As a side effect, use cases and adoption get a boost, hence bitcoin price and miner revenues increase.

But then what's the point of peter todd implementing it in bitcoin-core, if every node can do his own thing anyway? does peter Todd and btc core team fall for the same fallacy as me?
No! the answer is, and i know it just as well as p.todd does: Yes, a node *could* handle rbf acc. to his likings, completely arbitrarily. in *theory*. but the reality is that almost all nodes use bitcoin-core as-is. This explains why ptodd did what he did. your view is a bit too theoretical. in practice(!) (i.e. in reality as opposed to theory) it *does* matter what rbf policy bitcoin-core has implemented.

Rouboni has predicted the last financial bubble. Ok, great. Assuming this was not just luck (many experts predict many bubbles and crisis every year, so some are right sometimes, by pure chance), then does this give him ANY competence in scientific fields like mathematics or computer science?
Of course not.
His "charlatan and fraud" argument about the useless blockchain technology itself is particularly ridiculous. Just because there are ALSO many frauds and charlatans promoting a product with huge exaggerations, it does not mean that the product as such is a fraud! Is he really this stupid to not understand this triviality, or is he simply trying to manipulate? In either case, bad for his reputation - HE is a charlatan as well!
Think of an analogy:
A science lab claims having developed a new solar cell that has an efficiency of 95% rather than 15-20% typical today, using a revolutionary new technological approach. Many independent universities and scientists all around the world have studied, reproduced and reconfirmed this finding, so it is accepted in the scientific community.
As is to be expected, some esoteric fraud sites on the internet, as well as prominent individuals in this scene, claim that this invention can produce free energy even in complete darkness, because it is a free energy machine, and can solve all problems of mankind instantly.
Now there comes a financial expert with no scientific background in semiconductor physics whatsoever, and claims the whole technology is the biggest fraud in mankind's history, referencing to these esoteric fraud sites, and claims that everyone having invested in this tech has only done so because of the (wrong) promises these fraudsters have made, and so the whole invention is a complete fraud and the whole thing nothing but a big empty bubble.

You seem to be mal-informed. Which historical experience or evidence are you talking about? As far as I know, there are quite a few currencies in the world, no national fiat currency has eaten all the others, neither now nor in the past. And as far as crypto-currencies are concerned, Bitcoin's percentage of the total crypto-currency market cap has DECREASED ever since. You are free to believe that EVENTUALLY Bitcoin will grab the 99% of crypto market cap, but at least the historical evidence that you are referring to is indicating the opposite.

Nice article, but I think nb. 7 and nb. 9 need some more research - I want to believe what Henry writes but from all I understand and know I just cannot agree, unfortunately, I have severe doubts and think these two items are not fully thought through by Henry:
On Nb.7 - Scaling:
* The text misses to mention the easiest of all scaling options, which is an increase of the the block size. Not excessively! But careful increase in agreement with technological progress absolutely makes sense, and keeping it at 1 MB (as some stakeholders seem to want it to be) just suffocates Bitcoin's full potential at today's early stage. The fact that bitcoin core is postponing this natural step without convincing reasons makes me worry a lot. Not mentioning this tuning screw with a single word makes me worry that the author considers the 1 MB as final as well, which would be very bad, esp. because... see next items:
* The article misses to mention that the +80% capacity increase due to segwit is a THEORETICAL value only, because only valid when assuming that all users use segwit. However, it is more likely that segwit adoption will be rather slow, hence ACTUAL capacity increase will take a along time to reach nearly 80%.
* The article misses to mention that capacity increase via LN is a whole new thing: LN is not a simple capacity increase of Bitcoin, but means that Bitcoin characteristic and usage will change fundamentally from what we as users are today used to:
 - Users using LN would have to lock a certain amount of bitcoins in a payment channel and cannot react quickly and flexibly on price swings for example, without extra penalty. So they are not as liquid as they are today with their Bitcoin wallet (and if they do react and close the channel [which of course they can at any time] they pay overly high TX fees compared today).
 - LN means that users use central organizations (that offer the LN payment channels), and thereby Bitcoin loses a lot of its value as a DECENTRALIZED payment system! Controlling flows of Bitcoins is much easier for state authorities if most users use LN, because "LN operators" can be expected to be monitored closely by the state authorities.
 - LN offers more attack vectors that are not possible and unknown today! --&gt; If a timeout is missed (e.g. due to DoS), funds can be lost. Or if the end-user's wallet misses the time to close the payment channel in due time (e.g. because his smartphone was lost), funds may be lost, while today nobody can lose Bitcoins due to inactivity. All this is not considered in the article, the author only follows the general public "propaganda" that LN is a capacity increase of Bitcoin without dealing with the details of the differences and possible problems and drawbacks! He introduces himself as an expert following Bitcoin since 2011 on a daily basis. So do I, and I would encourage the author to be more differentiated on these topics.
On Nb. 9 - Sidechains:
* The article pretends that the Rootstock sidechain will materialize. This is far from clear. The article misses details on two-way-peg-sidechains that would have to be mention in an article like this to avoid misinformation: If such a 2-way sidechain is implemented, it means that Bitcoin nodes (incl. Bitcoin miners) need to receive, transmit, forward and process not only the data of the Bitcoin blockchain, but also the data of the sidechain(!), because otherwise the miner could not validate whether a locked bitcoin should be unlocked due to a "transfer" of coins from sidechain to Bitcoin's blockchain. But this means that the EFFECTIVE blocksize (i.e. total amount of data) increases!! It is very similar (effectively nearly equivalent) to an increase of the block size, with the corresponding consequences on decentralization etc.!!! I personally think that the danger to decentralization is largely overestimated, but today's small-block proponents that have the final say in bitcoin-core will NOT accept 2-peg-sidechains for the very same reasons they reject block size limit increase. So the notion that Rootstock 2-peg-sidechain is just around the corner is far too optimistic and misleading!

Correct, but all fiat currencies in the world work this way today, without any exception. Fiat has only value because (a) it is accepted for tax payment, and (b) because it is legal tender by law, and (c) its amount is controlled by the combined action of central banks and private banks, so there is some(!) degree of scarcity, but of course it must be continuously expanded to pay the interests, and this goes on so forever, by design.
PS: ...and (d) it has value because it can bring you from A to B. But that is another Fiat... :-)

I never understood why SegW has to be done *first* before 2MB HF. The lack of argument makes me believe it is just to hide the unwillingness to increase bl.sz.limit in the first place (for reasons one can only speculate about).
About your "points" of disagreement: I am very sorry I cannot follow your point(s). I see you have written words and phrases, but I am incapable of seeing the sense in it, you do not disprove my statement that limited capacity limits the network effect but talk about something else. So I have to assume you are trying to distract from the lack of argument against my points, which makes me even more suspicious than before that you are trying to hide something and try to manipulate. Sorry. But (counter-)arguments must be written in a clear and understandable manner and must hit the point instead of manoeuver around it.
Also your statement that lightning network is a means to *increase block size*(!) is alarming! Either you do not understand lightning, or you distract. Because as a matter of fact, lightning is an off-chain technique that does NOT increase blocksize but instead moves payments to centralized(!) payment channels running off-chain (except the final settlements) and has its own problems like new attack vectors (like time-out the settlement TX), plus all the dangers involved when centralized lightning channels must be used by the majority of participants.
The smallblock dogmatists don't WANT to see even the possibility that a user will much more likely use ltc or eth ON-CHAIN payment before using centralized lightning payment channels on Bitcoin, and that a premature "bonsai limit" on Bitcoin pushes users to alts (and dillutes Bitcoin's network effect) *unnecessarily* and *prematurely*.
The last two *italic words* cannot be highlighted strong enough. We are pushing users off Bitcoin now already, unnecessarily early (a few more MB of blocksize would not endanger decentralization in the light of technological evolution!).
--&gt; Who de-facto benefits (whether intended or not)? Other cryptos, and the central banks who see the free-crypto economy getting fragmented and have more time themselves to realize their own digital currency plans with end-user accounts at the central bank. It's the best that could happen to them (whether intended or not).
--&gt; Who suffers? Bitcoin, by losing network effect!
The logical (and pro-Bitcoin strategy) would be to keep Bitcoin users happy inside Bitcoin WHILE working on SegW, LN, and Co, and then to introduce these new techniques out of a comfortable situation were Bitcoin users are still happy. But bitcoin-core decides to first make Bitcoin users unhappy, divide the community, push users to altcoins via unnecessary(!) high tx fees and delay introduction of SegW &amp; Co indefinitely. This is the best strategy to harm Bitcoin, split the community and fragment the eco-system.
These are only observations, no conspiracies. But it is understandable that conspiracy theories evolve from this. But the question whether conspiracies exist or not is irrelevant to judge what is good or bad for Bitcoin.

you are right.
I am convinced the trade-offs are negligible:
* decentralization: 2MB will by no means centralze bitcoin anywhere close to a critical point.
* blockchain size: storage is no problem, no issue at all when doing the maths.
* Max Tx size: should remain at 1MB, so no negative impact on validation time for very big transactions. *(edit: arguments saying 2MB is bad because single TXs can become too large is an obvious strawman argument implying the false(!) misleading assumption that also max TX size must increase to 2MB.)*
* *EDIT: add'l point: I am convinced a hard fork (HF) as such (like 2MB HF) is NOT dangerous, and that this argument is completely unsuitable to explain why 2MB hardforks are not carried out very soon. Also it is contradictory: People say HF is dangerous, but also concede it will be done later, and BIPs exist to do HF in a save, controlled way. But then it would be (and of course it is) equally save to deploy the HF already now.*

No it doesn't. It uses elliptical curves. sha-256 is only used for hashing.
And sha256 is quantum-proof acc. to current knowledge.
What is quantum-attackable is that priv.key can be calculated from pub.key. I.e. all addresses which have already spent but are not empty would be attackable. Quick Workaround: move funds to new own address.
long term fix: protocol enhancement introducing quantum-proof cryptography algorithms also for priv./pub key cryptography.

Attacking satoshi's coins indeed is an unsolvable problem...
Seems these satoshi coins represent the best reward for the first entity in the world being able to build sufficiently powerful QC.
For the other concern, however, a solution exists. This concern is:


There is a decentralized solution to this, as follows:
The protocol shall mandate that every transition from an address whose public key has not been formerly revealed to a QC proof address must happen in two steps:
Step 1: The sha256 hash of that transaction is registered in the blockchain in block N.
Step 2: The transaction itself (which discloses the pub key for the very first time) is broadcasted to be included in any block after block N.
A QC attacker now would have to not only hack the private key but also have to register his "stealing transaction" with this key in a previous(!) block, i.e. block N or earlier. This is only possible by rolling back the complete blockchain so many blocks, and this is only possible with a vast 51% attack, which a QC computer cannot do.
EDIT: A QC attacker could also collude with miners to prevent my tx to be included. instead he registers his tx later and then gets his tx included by the malvolent miner.
@_date: 2018-10-06 12:49:21
Of course an effective block size increase is possible with softfork only.
Without having read that link, here is the solution for this that I always had on my mind since years (but never talked about it until now):
* Define a new data structure blockchain (call it "blockchain B" or "bcb" from now on). In this blockchain B (bcb), each block hash of bcb block M is a function of (a) the transactions in bcb block M, (b) bcb block hash M-1 and (c) Bitcoin blockchain block hash of block "M+*offset*", where *offset* is a fixed value fixed by SF protocol enhancement. This way there is a 1:1 relation between each bcb block and each original bitcoin blockchain block for block height &gt; "offset".
* The normal bitcoin block contains a certain standard dummy transaction (generated by the miner) that includes a special bit pattern in the optional OP_RETURN field. This 40 bytes (320 bit) field is seperated into 64 bit + 256 bit as follows: The first 64 bit (8 bytes) are a fixed bit pattern defined by the standard acc. to the SF and says "attention, this is a special pointer to the bcb block belonging to this block". The remaining 256 bits are a sha256 hash of the corresponding block of the bcb. A miner will only mine the bitcoin block if it knows the corresponding bcb block and deems it valid. So mining this bitcoin block also confirms the corresponding bcb block!
* How to "transition" from standard blockchain to bcb? Well: Assume 1 BTC was sent from A to B on standard blockchain in some earlier block. Now the owner of address B creates a TX sending 0.8 BTC from B to C. He forms this TX such that it shall be included in a bcb block instead of standard block, and broadcasts it to the network (the tx format shall be slightly different, so each broadcasted tx can only be added to standard block OR bcb block, as decided by the sender,, not the miner).
* If, 2 days later, the owner of B wants to send the same 0.8 BTC to D (double spend), that would be rejected by new miners because of an obvious double-spend of course. However, old miners not supporting this SF would accept it because they would not know about
the earlier tx from B to C. This is in analogy how non-segwit miners would consider a segwit tx an "anybody can spend tx". Of course, if an old miner accepted this tx from B to D and included it into a newly mined block, that new block would be considered invalid by the new miners (or any new nodes operating acc. to the SF), so the double spend could not prevail.
* If the owner of address C wants to spend some of his 0.8 BTC to E, he can readily do so with a normal TX for bcb. It has to be noted that this cannot happen on standard blockchain, because standard blockchain does not know that C has these 0.8 BTC. So any bitcoins that arrive on bcb remain on bcb forever and can never get back to standard blockchain. But that's ok, as bcb is just as valid as the standard blockchain after the SF.
Seems what I have decribed is pretty much the extension block idea ( (which is a SF) so sorry for that.

I don't (and never did) understand how this can work without running into the same problem as with a blocksize increase.
If a two-way peg side chain has 200MB blocks per 10min, all fully validating BITCOIN nodes must process this data to see if sidecoins were transferred to Bitcoin.

This question stems from misunderstandings on multiple levels. To clarify just a few things showing your question makes no sense at all:
* nb. of hashes is astronomically big, collision probability astronomically low
* each miner builds his blocks differently, so different hashes are the result anyway.
* If sharing made sense (which it doesn't), they would be dumb to share as they'd just help their competition, meaning spending active effort for losing money in return
* Even if *every* miner shared everything with every other miner and bandwidth and computational cost were negligible for this extra effort and if this helped in some practical way (all of which is not the case), all it would entail is a corresponding increase in difficulty by the bitcoin protocol difficulty adjustment algorithm, so that no miner would have any advantage or cost saving whatsoever in the end.

you assume that TX fee per byte remains the same when TX capa doubles. This is trivially a wrong assumption, based on demand ans supply. If there is a huge supply of block space exceeding the demand, of course TX fees will drop, likely will more than half, so overall TX fee revenues will be even smaller than today.


No way you can make it that simple. Proof: Bitcoin Cash is not with 4 times Bitcoin. Also Lightcoin is not worth 4 times Bitcoin. But acc. to your logic it should be.


Short term price may rise. Long term it is unsustainable if it harms decentralization and Bitcoin fundamental security, and Bitcoin loses its unique positions due to such politics.

Block reward was theoretically expected to become zero in year 2140, but actual block time will likely continue to be more like 9.4 than 10.0 min because the difficulty adjustment always lags behind as hash power keeps on increasing.
Hence the blockreward=0  can be expected alread around year 2130..2135.

I agree. Yet I think banks will offer fractional paper bitcoin certificates. for two reasons:
- because customers are used to these products, and

Maybe I used the wrong terminology (not a native speaker) but from my description I hoped made clear that I was talking about the RELATIVE value, so what you call "relative bonus". So I made wording error perhaps, not a logical error :-)


Of course I am still profiting as price rises (unless the "premium" (or "relative bonus") becomes negative), but not as much as I could, this is the whole point.
Imagine the case that 1BTC = $1,000 now, and 1BTC = $10,000 on 31 Dec 2017:
***Scenario 1:***
* I sell Casascius 1 BTC now for $2000 and buy 2 BTC (digital, not physical from the revenues) from it.
* End of 2017 I have $20,000 after selling these 2 BTC.
***Scenario 2:***
* I keep my Casascius 1 BTC.
* End of 2017 I sell it for $15,000 (=$10,000 face value + $5000 collector premium or bonus).
So in both scenarios I won:
In Scenario 1 I turned 1 BTC Casascious coin (worth $2000) into $20,000.
In Scenario 2 I turned 1 BTC Casascious coin (worth $2000) into $15,000.
Clearly, scenario 1 is better. That was my whole point.

I apologize, I think I fully misinterpreted your post.
I thought you wanted to say that SegWit activation would drive the price down, and a bug would do so too.
But of course what you wanted to say is that a yet unknown bug in SegWit, discovered only after SegWit activates, would drive the price down.
I agree of course, but it's very unlikely given the reviews and tests.

I prefer $**7373.73**, because **73** is simply the **"best number"** acc. to Sheldon Lee Cooper!
* **73** is a prime number, and so is its reverse number **37**. 
* **73** is 1001001 in binary representation, which is a palindrome (=same as its reverse number).
  * Moreover, 1001001 consists of **7** digits, **3** of which are ones.
* **73** is 111 in octal representation - again a palindrome.
  * This sequence, which happens to mean **7** in the binary system, has again **3** ones.
* **73** as Morse code is – – · · · · · · – – , which is, you guessed it, a palindrome.
* **73** is the 21^st prime number. So it is no surprise that **37** happens to be the 12^th prime number.
  * Also not surprisingly any more, 12^2 = 144, whereas its reverse number squared is - you guessed it - the reverse number! Yes, 21^2 = 441.
Footnote of history: (Not quite but almost) all of this happened on *Big Bang Theory*'s **73**^rd episode, *"The Alien Parasite Hypothesis"*, at what time Sheldon Cooper actor Jim Parsons, who was born in 19**73**, was **37** years old.

up to now I have found all reasons that blocksize limit is connected to price, and I have not found any reason why it should be unrelated.
The sole reason the price rises a bit (ca.30%) the recent days does by no means constitute an even tiny piece of evidence that bitcoin price wouldn't have increased much more much earlier if Bitcoin's practical utility weren't reduced by the artificial 1MB bonsai limit.
Making the inference "Bitcoin price has gone up the recent days, hence 1MB block size limit and full blocks is not harmful to Bitcoin price" is such a flawed logic that it hurts and insults people's intelligence.

@_date: 2018-10-02 15:58:43
yes. but does it make sense to talk about an "iou" against the central bank? It used to make sense when usd was underlaid by gold, but that time is long gone.
Today the usd speaks for itself and is not backed by anything else, so the concept of "iou" makes no sense to me when speaking about usd paper notes.
When we talk about "iou", we must answer what the debtor owes the creditor when the creditor hands the iou back to the debtor.
So if I as a debtor go to my private bank and claim the underlying value of 1 usd on my bank statement, the priv bank must give a 1 usd note. So the bank statement is an iou.
But if I go to the Fed with a 1 USD note and claim my underlying for it in return, they will laugh at me and say that the 1 USD is the underlying already! So a 1 usd note is not an IOU.

Fortunately, we do not necessarily need QC resistant asymmetric algorithms to make Bitcoin quantum resistant. All we need is a protocol modification, and this is even a softfork. All we need is to add the two following SF rules to the protocol:
1. All TX outputs must go to new addresses, i.e. reuse of addresses are forbidden for new transactions (first new SF rule)
2. A TX is only considered a valid TX if its sha256 hash was registered in an earlier block (second new SF rule)
That's all. This "registering" proves that the genuine owner of the priv key knew the priv key before a potential QC attacker knew it, so I use Bitcoin's built-in "proof of existence" blockchain feature to secure against this type of QC attack.
The details are a matter of concrete protocol definition. E.g. one could use a dummy transaction with the optional and otherwise unused OP_RETURN field (max. 320 bits) to register the hash of the TX, and one could use the same op_return field in the actual transaction to point to the block and the TX within that block to find its registered hash.
Admittedly, this mechanism is not fully safe if a QC attacker colludes with a miner. The attacker may intercept the pub key of my actual tx and calc the priv key from it and may pursuade the miner to not include my TX in his block. Instead, the attacker submits an own registration TX and the actual TX thereafter.
This problem can be countered however by adding a further SF rule to the protocol:
* 3. The funds shall be locked for "n" blocks after Tx. (again a SF rule)
So I have time for n blocks to submit my legit TX to the blockchain (via a non-malvolent miner), pointing to my registration (which is older than the attacker's registration).
* 4. That would render the attacker's transaction invalid acc. to the new protocol's rules (now this is a hardfork rule, admittedly, because legacy miners would consider my legit TX an illegal double-spend to the attackers TX).
With this improvement, the attacker would have to collude with 51% of the miners to be still successfull. Well, this would still be worse than today, because it would mean a QC attacker with 51% mining power could hijack transactions and steal their TX inputs, which today is impossible no matter how much mining power one has.
Anyway, probably more of a theoretical threat, and a workable solution should quantum resistant asymmetric algorithms fail to show up.

2-way sidechain has the same effect as block size increase: Miners need to validate Bitcoin blockchain AND sidechain data (otherwise they cannot verify coin transfers from Sidechain to Bitcoin blockchain), i.e. need to receive, transmit, process (much) more data.
Will bitcoin-core really allow this? (rhetorical question)
@_date: 2016-06-05 22:28:50
Question: Wouldn't 2-peg sidechains cause Bitcoin to become more centralized the same way a massive block size increase would?
Reason why I think so: Bitcoin miners have to monitor the sidechain's blockchain, otherwise they cannot know if a sidechain coin was "transferred back" to the Bitcoin blockchain. In that case the miner has to unlock a formerly locked coin to become usable again by the user on the Bitcoin blockchain.
Other miners must of cause validate this unlocking, so they, too, have to observe the sidechain.
So, to summarize, all miners must download not only the Bitcoin blockchain but also the blockchains of all sidechains that have a two-way peg to the Bitcoin blockchain.
But then, the cumulative size of the Bitcoin blockchain plus all these sidechains is what determines bandwidth and storage requirements for Bitcoin fully validating nodes.
So if Bitcoin core developers will not increase block size limit, they will not introduce sidechains either, will they?

Either you accept turing-complete contracts with all its consequences, or you concede that the concept of purely mathematical smart contracts cannot work in practice without the support of courts, lawyers or similar forms of human judgement (call them mining operators, developers or whatever).
*Edit: meanwhile [Vitalik has clarified]( that these "The DAO terms" are not legally binding because they were written by any arbitrary person. Instead of such terms, what actually counts is the code itself (which happens to be exactly what these terms say), but the "social contract" ULTIMATELY decides.

That's a pro for Bitcoin. European here: I think this will bring anarchy rather than law&amp;order.
Here in Europe the general majority opinion (incl. myself) is that possession of weapons does not increase but decrease freedom and security. Because the others possess weapons, too, so the notion of increased security due to possession of weapons is an illusion and a fallacy. As simple as that. Many accidents and tragedies that happened as a result of private possession of weapons confirm this. Here in Germany people feel more free by being allowed to drive 120, 130 mph and more (and having cars that do not make you feel uncomfortable when doing so) and feel more free by knowing that *not* everybody is allowed to possess weapons.

The "logic": If 14 miners, each with 5% market share, do not use segwit mining, each of them can say "I am not blocking SegWit, because I will upgrade to SegWit if the others upgrade first."

Explanation: Bitcoin is exchanged against VEF, not USD, for
1 BTC = 800,000 VEF.
Gov'mt Official fiat exchange rate is
1 USD = 10 VEF.
This WOULD make it 1 BTC = 80,000 USD.
BUT the de-facto x-rate is more like
1 BTC = 1000 USD.
This yields a more realistic x-rate of
1 BTC  = 800 USD.
(all values are rough and rounded)

The scenarios 1 and 2 is about what I DO with a given (same) price development. So Scenario 3 cannot be another price development but only another behaviour in this setup.
So it is not clear to me what you are suggesting.
*EDIT: In case price drops to $100, Scenario 1 is worst, Scenario 2 is probably better (assuming the percentage premium is higher for $100 than for $1000, which seems like a reasonable assumption), and scenario 3 (=selling the coin now and keeping the fiat) is best. Maybe this is what you had in mind.*
*So, yes, indeed, in both cases (BTC price rises or price drops) the scenario 2 "I keep my Casascius coin" is the "middle performer", so it seems that keeping the Casascius coin is a conservative strategy that prevents too much loss but also too much gain. So I have a reason not to call myself "stupid" any more, I am just a conservative investor.* :-)

in short: an exchange is only a platform where participants can place buy and sell order. Not the exchange is the market maker, but each participant who places an order that he hopes will get filled (i.e. each order arriving in the exchange's order book) is a market maker.
Hence, the exchange operator only offers the trading platform and makes the bookkeeping. But it has no active say at all w.r.t. price development.
So your statement


is completely wrong and confuses the roles of the trading platform with the actual market participators. An exchange is the former, your statement suggests it is the latter, a price-manipulating market participant, which is completely wrong.

*some* people think so, not "people" in general.
Most people understand that even uneducated people can well differentiate between "bit" as a unit in computer science, "bit" as an expression for a small quantity in casual language, and "bit" as a unit of account (price) for a currency, depending on the context. Just as fir nany other words that have different meanings depending on context.

Ok, now things get more into perspective.
On the other side of the argument, we have to make sure that Bitcoin does not slowly get its decentralization diluted. So work on efficiency improvements is very important, and this includes L2 techniques like LN or sidechains. Eventually, also blocksize has to increase of course.
Afaics, bitcoin core devs understand this and acts accordingly - and the eco-system will role out such techniques sooner than many thought.
That's my observation at least. I don't share the other fud and conspiracy.

I find **⫵** (or **ⲿ**) charming as it not only resembles an "m" with horizontal bar, but could also be read as "strike out three decimals".
otherwise **₥** or **ꝳ** or **ᵯ** could be used - maybe even interchangeably? (but I also find **ꭑ** quite neat)
In contrast, **Ҍ** or **ƀ** is probably better suited as denomination symbol for bits (µBTC).
¢ = cent = 1/100 currency symbol
₥ = mill = 1/1000 currency symbol

I am reading lots of nonsense here. You say exchanges are speculating. Speculation however is not the business model of an exchange platform, but of a speculator. Exchanges' business model is to earn from the exchange fees.
What you describe is a mixture of speculation and fractional reserve banking in the absence of a lender of last resort - very risky. Cannot be ruled out that some shady exchanges do that anyway, but the normal proper exchanges don't.
If you do not understand it, ok, rest in your believe and keep on smokin' ;-)

I am afraid this list is completely incorrect. Acc. to this list almost all pubs/restaurants in all German cities accept bitcoin - this is certainly too good to be true!
That's when I enter "bitcoin" in the search filter.
If I enter "litecoin" (just for the sake of comparison) I get no hit at all. If I enter "accept bitcoin" I get no hit at all for bar/pub/restaurant not even in Berlin, which again cannot be correct.
So I conclude yelp is completely useless for identifying bars/restaurants that accept bitcoin. Make the test for yourself if you don't believe me.

BUT: By the way: to be fair you should have included in your screenshot the text line just underneath the exchange rate text field!
otherwise one may think that you hide a piece of the truth intentionally, thereby influencing people by OMISSION OF IMPORTANT INFORMATION! This does not shed the best light on you and this subreddit.
note: the **text directly underneath the exchange rate warns the user that this rate is all but optimum and should be used with care**.
You may think that is irrelevant because the text above says in big letters "best rate", but no matter how justified you(!) may think such judgement is, you should still leave the judgement to all readers individually and should't do the judgement for them and withhold information required for an unbiased judgement!
For this reason **I have to downvote you** and even have to report your post and hope it will be removed by the moderators because it is sensationally  **misleading by intentionally withholding crucial information**.

In July, viabtc created two tokens "bitcoin cash" and "btc_frozen", and btc holders on viabtc could swap 1 btc for 1 btc_frozen and 1 bitcoin_cash, and then trade it. In August they then got one real bitcoin cash for each former bitcoincash future token, and one real btc for each former btc_frozen token.
now for the june creation of bip148 token, what was the counterpart token that time?

@_date: 2017-01-22 17:45:35
you can create your own new crypto called "island coin". that's the best you can do.
using legacy bitcoin (or otherAltCoin) would mean forking the blockchain, creating an BitcoinIslandFork. You would even need to fork the protocol in terms of resetting difficulty for obvious reasons. Once you reenter civilisation, your islandForkChain would become worthless - and THAT is the main reason why it won't work.
So no point using BitcoinIslandFork - it would only give the big bitcoin owners a starting advantage on the island - this would not get any consensus. Instead, a new currency IslandCoin would be the way to go. It would also (likely) become worthless when they reenter civilization one day, but at least does not create biased starting conditions on the island.
What would work: if all users had opened a LN payment channel BEFORE they stranded on the island, they can use that LN network offline on the island. Once they return to civilization, they can close the payment channels, so nothing is lost.
@_date: 2017-01-22 20:44:05
The way LN works, after all the participants have opened a payment channel, they send each other messages with signed transactions OFF-chain. Only after some time the payment channel can be closed by an ON-chain transaction.
If the lock times of the payment channels are sufficiently long, these offchain payment can happen in the civilized world, or equally well on our hypothetical island.
Admittedly, this idea is a bit theoretical, because it would require that all participants had opened a payment channel before they arrived at the island, AND they are interconnected (they'll find a route using only participants of the island), AND the lock time is longer than the expected stay on the island.

Bitcoin users don't have to know about AES256, and even less do they need to know that AES256 uses 256 bits. So what you are worrying about is de-facto a non-issue.
If it is still not clear - here are a few analogies:
1. *"My zip compression uses a 256 bit AES256 encryption. Does it mean that I have to put 256 bit of data into the zip file?"*
2. *"My email encryption uses a 256 bit key. Does it mean that I have to attach 256 bit of data to my email message?"*
3. *"My browser's https connection uses a 256 bit AES256 encryption. Does it mean that I cannot transfer a credit card number over the encrypted communication channel that is longer than 256 bit? Or does it mean it won't work if my internet speed is only 64k bits per second?"*
4. *"I am only allowed to drive 60 miles per hour on this highway. Does it mean that I have to stop my car after driving 60 more miles from this point onwards?"*
5. *"I bought an apple at the grocery store. Now where should I insert the SIM card?"*
Obviously, all three (five) analogies are dumb as hell and the obvious answer is "no", because the 256 bits on the LOWER LAYER PROTOCOL level has nothing to do with the application layer and is usually not even visible to the user! So there is no risk at all of confusing the one "bits" with the other "bits".


No. Please stop this legend. In fact, anybody serious will have no problems to differentiate the currency unit "*bit*" from the data unit "*bit*" or the language term "a little *bit*" or the German beer brand "*bit*", unless s/he has an IQ&lt;70. You have to be neither particularly tech- nor language- nor beer-savvy to comprehend this triviality.
We need to stop this artificial legend that there is a risk of confusion when there isn't.


The domain "currency unit" is VERY different from the domain of technical internals of bitcoin technology under the hood. Users won't be confronted with the latter, and tech-savvy people run no danger at all of confusing the two, which are of entirely different domains.
So the complete talk about that there could be confusion is artificially made-up hystery.

I thin kBitcoin has better changes than Tesla, t.b.h.
Tesla is in hype, but other car manufactureres have great e-cars in the pipeline, too. And Tesla is not so nice when sitting inside, the material etc. is quite chep. Not at all what you would expect from such an expensive car. It reminds me of a share ie solarworld, that was hyped a lot but is now insolvent.
For Bitcoin, I see long-term fundamentals more positive.

So you are against solution A because a solution B exists that is equally good? With this attitude you can never progress by accepting any solution X because there will always be a solution Y which is equivalent or even superior on some aspects (even if inferior on other aspects), thereby you cement stagnation forever.
To be very clear: Whenever you have two good but non-identical solutions X and Y, there will be pros and cons for both, and always some people will find solution X overall better while others find solution Y overall better. If, under such circumstances, pragmatism is overruled by political tactics, we'll end up in stagnation and destroy Bitcoin's future. Needless to say that there are people in the second row who work in a subtle way to achieve exactly this.

Welcome to Bitcoin!
Transaction size does not at all depend on nb. of BTCs in the transaction.
But tx size depends on nb of inputs for example, i.e. not every tx has the same size (but that is NOT because of the nb of bitcoins being transferred!).
That's why different full blocks contain different nb. of transactions. And that's why the THEORETICAL max capacity of the Bitcoin network is 7 tx per second (TPS), but the de-facto capacity is close to 3 TPS.

You replied to OP by explaining low BTC fees with an increased difficulty in BCH. I explained this is illogical.

I fully disagree. This view can only be expressed by people who see Bitcoin's only value in its rareness. But if that was all, those economist were right who call it biggest bubble ever. To understand that Bitcoin has real world use cases, you need to understand its technology. This is what represents the fundament of Bitcoin's value. Then its scarcity comes on top. Scarcity alone would not justify Bitcoin's value.
That's what these economists like Mr. R. miss, hence they come to wrong conclusions.

I hope, and in fact I believe, that is true.
But I am talking here about the theoretical possibility of a fundamental and dramatic crypto breach over night and the consequences that that would have - as said - knowing that the probability of this occurring is very low.
It is much more likely that vulnerabilities of elliptic curve of sha256 cryptography happens step wise, and legit owners have enough time to move their funds to new addresses secured by better crypto.

Coinbase is not a bank that is a bitcoin lender of last resort. Unlike fiat, bitcoin cannot be produced by a central bank to bail out a private company like a private bank.

In your case I understand it was money you could afford to lose - extra money after selling a house.

Remember the time when we all paid with Cash at Walmart &amp; Co, but withdrew our cash from the ATMs?
* (1) So our bank account was sort of saving account.
* (2) But when we went shopping we moved some funds from saving acount to spending account (= leather wallet) via an ATM, paying some fees. To avoid too much fees, we usally moved a bit more from saving to spending account, to minimize ATM fees.
Bitcoin / LN workflow is very comparable to this:
* (1) Our "savings account" is our Bitcoin on-chain wallet.
* (2) We can move some amount from our savings to spending account be locking some bitcoins in a LN channel. This costs some on-chain fee. To minimize these fees, we tend to move a bit more, such that it is suitable for more than just one single purchase.
Of course it is not identical, but similarities between these workflows are striking.

You should distance yourself more from Peter Schiff and other people incapable of learning and abstracting.
(By the way: people do make transactions with bitcoin)


Acc. to this "logic", BTC should have fallen long-term ever since it came into existence since 8 years ago. The exact opposite is true. This proves your whole argument wrong - as wrong as it could possibly be. Cardinal error: You look only at the supply and ignore the demand.


Just as it is in surplus now compared to 5 years ago.

I said it is similar, not identical, from the workflow perspective, so it only serves as a nice comparison, not a perfect analogy.
From the underlying asset, you are right that the on-chain asset is the true asset, whereas in fiat world it is the paper cash that is the true asset. So in this respect it is the other way round.
But from practical handling point of view the analogy is still interesting. And when thinking further, the Bitcoin/LN model makes more sense than the fiat model:
* In the fiat model, the true asset is what you use for daily spending, whereas your "savings account" is not a true asset but a bank liability that can get lost (see e.g. Cyprus 2013). This is intrinsically wrong!
* In contrast, in the Crypto Bitcoin/LN model, we do it the right way: The "savings account" is the true asset (=on-chain coins), whereas for the "spending account" you have it locked "for some while" in a payment channel. This makes much more sense! Another advantage is that the payment channel lightning network can be used to not only spend but also receive funds, so it is so much more flexible and useful than the fiat world "spending" counterpart.
@_date: 2017-08-06 10:48:25
Just FYI:
If you trust mathematics so much, you must also accept the fact that there is no mathematical proof that Bitcoin's cryptography is safe.
All we can rely on is many years of academia and hackers trying to find weaknesses and haven't succeeded yet. But we also know from experience and history that sometimes certain mathematical unproven assumptions unexpectedly turn out to be false.
If you really trust maths as much as you claim you do, you have to accept these facts. Otherwise you lie to yourself.

Not sure I get you right, but if *"in 10 years BTC is worth $500,000~~k~~ and there is zero extra value for the coin"* then I lost not $1000 but $500,000. Here's why:
Retrospect in year 2027:
* Had I sold the Casascious 1 BTC coin for $2000 beginning of January 2017 ($2000 = $1000 face value + $1000 collector bonus or premium or however we should call it) and then bought 2 BTC from that $2000 on Bitstamp, then today (year 2027) I would own 2 \* $500,000 = $1,000,000, i.e. $500,000 more than what I actually own now (=now in 2027).

you don't understand!
If a cryptographic vulnerability is discovered that allows everyone to spend all coins, the vulnerability applies since the very first block. All UTXOs are affected. Ypou could not change it for UTXOs already there.
Sorry, if you don't understand that, you have to learn Bitcoin from scratch.

yes maybe.




But it makes no sense at all that a trade is happening at 0.07800**3** BTC while my sell order for 0.07800**0** BTC is still on the order book. The trade platform should make best prices for everybody. So whoever paid these 0.07800**3** BTC per BCH paid 0.000003 BTC too much, because if his order would have been matched with MY sell order over 0.07800**0** BTC, he would have got a better price.
So I strongly suspect that Kraken is doing something fishy here (and I am sure Kraken support will not "help me" on this - because they cannot):
If I launch a sell order for 0.07800**0** BTC and short time later someone else launches a buy order for 0.07800**3** BTC, then the correct way would be that the platform matches the orders for 0.07800**0** BTC (i.e. the first price on the platform). However, I assume what Kraken does is this: For me it settles the order for 0.07800**0** BTC, but for the buyer it settles his order for 0.07800**3** BTC, so both traders, me and him, get the order filled acc. to the set limit, but the extra gap of 0.000003 BTC is an extra profit for Kraken in addition to the normal fees.

To put things into perspective:
At current rate we have:
* **1 bit = 0.09 cent^(USD)**
* **1 bit = 0.105 JPY**
* **1 bit = 1.67 ITL (Italian Lira)**
When BTC = 1033 EUR (i.e. bitcoin worth a little less than BTC/EUR all-time-high), we have
* **1 bit = 2 ITL (Italian Lira)**
So the unit of "bits" is well in the realm of what is used in daily life already today (or in Italy: till end of 2001).

Even fond managers take Bitcoin already, I heard recently. Looks like a shift of paradigm. The run up is not even close to 2013, not even like the smaller "Cyprus run" in spring 2013. $1000 now is like less than $100 in early 2013. And nobody believed it would reach 4-digit the same year. The current increase is much slower and steadier than what happened before.
I am following Bitcoin since 2011 and I have never seen times as calm and stable as the last 2.5 years. A bubble would go to mid to high 4-digit values to be comparable with earlier bubbles, or even 5-digit.
More often one can read investors talking about Bitcoin as an investment class. While perhaps not likely, if Bitcoin really becomes an investment class (maybe boosted by gold bans in certain countries), 5 digit is no less possible than 4-digit in 2013. This does not mean that there aren't risk. To me both &gt;10000 and &lt;500 is possible in 2017, depending on what happens.

hello mr. attack 3/page8.
Not each attack is equally ~~dangerous~~ *simple and likely*.
If a bitcoin sits on an address with pub key revealed, QC has all tine of the world to steal it.
If bitcoin sits on an address with pub key unknown, attacker has to attack when this address spends, it has to hack within avg. 10 min., and it mus convibce miners to use his spending instead of the first one.
Of course it is clear that the 2nd attack is much more difficult, so one would be stupid not to move sensitive amount of coin to an address w/o pub key known.
Also, one could wait there and not spend these btc until safer mechanisms are in place (btc protocol enhancements) that make such attack even more difficult. such enhancements are based on proof of knowledge of the priv key at a certain time - if I can prove I knew the priv key earlier than the attacker, then I have the right to spend the coin and the attacker has not - such protocol enhancements are possible.

Well actually it has rised from 0.148€ to 3€ in a bit more than **2.5 years**, that is a factor of 20.27 or, equivalently, a rise by **+1927%** - sorry for being pedantic.
To reach +2000% it needs to reach 3111.60€.
[Well, yes, at it's low in 2015 it was at about that level for a short time. (That's when I sold a considerable stake of my coins and got less than a car for it... but that's another story)]

yeah, but after that event yoiu effectively start with a random new ledger where all wealth in the bitcoin ledger has been re-distributed, depending on who of the "everyone" has grabbed the free coins, first. Probably this will be miners themselves, who included transactions into blocks where they spend the "now free" coins to themselves.
As a result, the ledger and thus Bitcoin would be completely worthless of course, unrecoverable.

my conviction is:
since bitcoin is no registered trademark, people and markets will define what is called bitcoin.
if the eco-system agrees on a hardfork with considerable majority, THIS will be bitcoin, even if an ideologic minority rejects the HF.
Otherwise, it would mean bitcoin could never scale beyond today's on chain capa (because the 1-5% minority will always be there). and that would be bitcoin's death, i.e. LN couldn't scale for mass adoption.

As long as the forkers are a small group (bitcoin cash: ca. 10% of the market) it is ok, we can ignore them and move on.
However, it might be more like a 50:50 split next time. And each time afterwards.

I agree there are downsides as you say. but it could be a way to give users a relatively safe (albeit cumbersome) way to transfer their savings from legacy address to another, future, qc proof address. So they would only face this cumbersome-ness once.
While it is not a perfect solution, it is still much better than using today's protocol means in the presence of QC threats, that is clear. That's why I'd call it a solution that brings an improvement for said use-case, not of course a perfect solution for all use cases.
Maybe your definition of the word "solution" is a different one, and that's why you do nit call it a solution. Then let's not argue about wording.

bc1-addresses have typically 44 characters, as opposed to typically 34 for legacy addresses starting with 1. So the new addresses are not more "efficient", they are however most robust against yielding another valid address accidentally when you mis-type. So they are most effective in avoiding bad consequences due to mistyping.

From what I understood, they also set a limit on the max block size to accept, and a parameter specifying after how many confirmations they stop rejecting such a "too big" block. Problem is every miner can set his own parameters, yielding a lot of orphaning (thus reducing security) and even the possibility of "hiding" attacks against unpleasant miner minorities. Without an agreed-upon parameter adaptation voting protocol on top of BU (which is indeed intended as I understood but not existing) the whole thing is half-baked.

The points are:
* feel free to read the segwit benefits yourself in the segeit readups (e.g. in bitcoin wiki) if you are genuinely interested
* segwit is not only about short term capa increase
* segwit lays the foundation for future improvements, e.g. by transaction malleability fixes it enables lightning network in full feature, which gives much more capacity off-chain and offloads on-chain traffic
* It separates different kinds of data into separate parts and applys different weights to it. This better reflects actual network costs than today's situation where all kinds of data have the same cost weight.
* segwit also makes it easier to scale on-chain capacity via hardfork in a future step (i.e. actual "block size increase) than without segwit, e.g. by removing the quadratic validation time increase problem.
What's the "better solution" you are thinking of?

This is the **"good old fallacy" on statistical variation**. And **I can substantiate my claim** by a very simple Monte-Carlo-Simulation that illustrates the amount of normal statistical variation. In fact, with the true share of SegWit staying at 25%, it would be absolutely surprising if the 144-block average would not regularly move to 15% or 35% values!

I think that'd be the best for all, for the complete eco-system. And opposed to others, I would NOT see this as an example that would lead to quick subsequent 4MB, 8MB, 16 MB ... blocksize inflation. The segwit/2x thing was a very special one-time constellation. And: Sooner or later core will anyway hardfork to 2MB, because with main stream adoption current capa is just good enough to open and close one LN payment channel per person on earth in an entire life span. So if it needs to be done anyway, better do it now and avoid another harmful split of Bitcoin into three parts of which no chain may be the clear leader (which would harm Bitcoin severely).

1. The notion that any puzzle is solvable by human BECAUSE it was made by human is obvious nonsense independent of Bitcoin.
2. You don't understand the definition of inflation - again independent of Bitcoin. Bitcoins are limited in supply, so if Bitcoin economy increases it yields DEflation, not INflation.
3. Again, bitcoin supply is finite.

Same for me. Casascius alias Mike Caldwell is personally known in the community, he is an engineer, he has written some notable BIPs, he has a reputation to lose, and I believe him that he has worked very carefully and painstakingly - I remember he has described in detail how he produced the keys and coins etc. For all the others, I simply think they are copy cats and don't take so much care in these things.
Nevertheless, I would never trust anybody (not even him) if it were about life changing amounts of money, that his keys are really safe. Not because of him, but because of me...

very true. many people confuse the role of trading platform with that of traders.
of course trading platform ownsers can also act as traders on their own platform (e.g. benefitting from zero fees and from better understanding than avg. trader of what are the conditions defined fir a future token), but that is optional and speculative...


I agree! (and this is how they did it in the  btccash case). Otherwise it would be more like a bet than a token.


Actually I would be surprised if it didn't happen. viabtc can collect trading fees w/o risk, as a trading platform.

Are you trolling or do you really not understand? So I will be very clear taking your own words:


...these coins then belong to thieves, because anybody could spend anybody's coins! And likely these anybodies will be the miners, who will attribute Bitcoin's market cap worth to themselves and now to any random user broadcasting a TX into the Bitcoin mem pool.


Yes. but this is once too much!


Yes. But this does not help, because all coins now belong to thieves/unjustified/random new owners. Who would want to use such a ledger from this point onwards? Any new ledger that starts from scratch is worth more than a ledger where the initial coin owners are provably thieves or at least unjustified uses. That is muc worse even than any ico/pre-mined scam coin, where at least the coin creators (and not random thieves) get a good stake of the coin's market cap.


Again - the starting point of this "good(?!?) new Bitcoin world" is that the new owners of the 16.5+x Million coins are thieves. Nobody will use such a ledger for anything. Instead, people will either move to a new clean ledger (=complete restart of Bitcoin from a new Genesis block with new wealth distribution from scratch), or (more likely!) another already existing coin that does not contain that security hole will replace Bitcoin.

You want people to enter their privkey, that's obvious. Despite the warning, 0.1% of users will overlook it, and that's enough for you in absolute numbers! Same "business idea" as for other kinds of phishing.
There is nothing "interesting" about it, as you say. You could equally well generate new private keys yourself and input them to your own tool. Why do you need OTHER people to input THEIR priv keys, other than stealing them? Mathematically/scientifically there is no reason at all!
In Germany we call this "Bauernfängerei".
You know full well that it will NEVER (not even "eventually") be possible to list all keys, no matter how much capacity Google or others scale up, because there are as many priv keys as atoms in the universe (2^256) and as many addresses as atoms on earth (2^160).

If I were an entity trying to limit Bitcoin's power, after having failed to ban it, I'd try to steer Bitcoin in a direction that it (plus its community and eco-system) **destroys itself** ***from the inside***.
I'd try to support parties and forces that tear Bitcoin appart from the inside, of course in a subtle manner not disclosing my true motives or identity.
I'd make use of forces that are already there! I'd just make minor "adjustments" to the balance of forces to ensure that the outcome is what I like. I have to make sure that opposing parties are of equal power, the more equal, the better. If power is unbalanced, I deliver weapons to the weaker party. The rest goes by itself, I can eat popcorn and watch how the parties destroy each other (here by forking Bitcoin again and again in as equal parts as possible) in their religious war (they'd call it "scientific convictions" of course, not religion, and they'd call their opponents "religious", but for me that is just fine and has the same characteristics as a religious war that I want to take place).
This would be my perfidious plan. The "cool" thing would be that the main actors on either side of that war would think they fight for the right thing (namely their own deep convictions) and that their enemy they are fighting is the main war actor on the other side. None of the war actors involved would be aware that they are both actually fighting for the same thing, just have (slightly) different views. None of them knows that the true enemy is acting in the background and just uses them as "useful idiots" destroying each other.
Once the war is over and scorched earth is left, and the thing both sides were fighting for was destroyed (or sufficiently tamed), I can leave my hideout and present a "better" system to the world that is actually working.

You violated a basic investment rule:
**Only invest in what you actually** ***understand*** --&gt; Value Investment.
Anything else is gambling, and usually gambling eventually ends badly.
Certainly, you did not understand these altcoins, you were, as you say yourself, greedy, and the result is inevitable loss.
(My-oh-my! - you burnt 400 BTC = 1.6 Million USD of today's value)
So the lesson learned is, to follow the old and UTMOST simple rule of Warren Buffet (yes!) and his teacher Benjamin Graham - the two godfathers of value investment. They wrote huge books, but basically, the main rule is really simple: Only invest in what you understand.
I hope you do understand Bitcoin (because if not, you shouldn't invest in that either).
I do have a certain understanding of Bitcoin and have followed its story and evolution of technology and eco-system on an almost daily basis for the last six years. So I invest in it. Warren Buffet himself does not understand Bitcoin, and so he is absolutely RIGHT if he does not invest a penny in it, because from his point of view it would be a gamble (he could just as well invest in an altcoin - he knows equally little about that).
So, long story short: Only invest in what you understand from the inside and where you have really thoroughly made your due diligence. Combine this with rule nb. 2 - diversity (put not all investments in one asset or group of assets, instead diversify). Then you should succeed long term.
The catch is: It requires work and time to *understand* the asset that you invest in. It is so much more convenient to just listen to gurus and do what they say (e.g. if you just listen to what I say, you make a mistake already!). This is what most do. Hence YOU will be successful if you do take the time and effort to *understand* what you invest in. Because then you are a step ahead of the masses.
I know that most people (not only here but in the overall population) will not (be [cap]able to) follow this advice. And this is why this advice works for those who do follow it.

In segwit case, everything is clear, everyone knows the rules and the 5% veto rule. Only in complete ignorance of this reality can you say that not voting for segwit does not mean blocking it.
What is more, certain miners have been very clear and very vocal about the fact that they do want to prevent segwit, and we can assume that those who were not vocal are still well informed about the current situation (although not necessarily well informed about segwit, as many examples show some people do not like facts).

He is also known as "MasterLuc" in bitcointalk and when going back to 2013 etc. we see he made very insightful analysis back in 2013, 2014, 2015, so his views are not random but the result of some analysis. His analysis was never clickbait, in fact he does it only for himself, not for others, and just writes it down to order his own thoughts (he somewhere described it that way as I remember). He has seen certain future patterns well in advance and was usually right, incl. the ascent in 2013 and the 2 year long decent/side-movement starting 2014...

I wouldn'd say it is.
Their criticizm of BTC and endorsement of BCH couldn't be more clear, otherwise they wouldn't have written a clearly sense-free sentence like this:
*"On the other hand, the digital currency is far from being irreplaceable, and faces increasing challenges from* ***potent(!) rivals*** *like* ***bitcoin cash(!)***. *"*  (highlighting and exclamation marks (!) added)
At least they would have named altcoins here like Monero, Ethereum or Litecoin that DID gain some traction over Bitcoin since their inception. Bitcoin cash is the least senseful example to name in this context. Clearly it is intended manipulation and reinforces the suspicion that it should serve as a "china coin".

Simply the bitcoin could be spent with any of the two private keys!
Edit: You left out the step of generating a bitcoin address, and your question should read: Can two different private keys (with usually also different public keys) generate the same Bitcoin address?
Answers are the same as above: Since there are 2^256 priv keys but only 2^160 Bitcoin addresses, there must exist MANY such collisions. Nevertheless, the likelihood of finding such, even with HUGE computer power, is astronomically low!
And if it happens anyway, all owners of a priv key generating this btc address could of cause spend its bitcoins.

the order was filled in the meantime, as described. But as described, the fact that at the  top of the web page a higher price (0.078003 BTC) was indicated as "LAST TRADE" and yet my sell order at a lower price (0.078 BTC) was still unfilled thereafter (even after page refresh), and it took more than a minute (maybe 2 or 3 or 5) until my order book was filled.

We need a LN wallet as easy to use as a Bitcoin wallet.
We need an infrastructure of reliable watch tower services, so users do not have to worry about getting their LN channel robbed while offline. And these integrated in the LN wallets.
Then, next:
We need browser LN wallet plugins (or native support eventually) for functionalities by which users can click-away annoying advertisements on web pages or videos for fractions of cents, or pay cents for "read-per-click" paywalls without need to first register at the news site.
Likewise, people uploading Youtube videos leave there LN donation address, in case their viewers prefer to micro-pay rather than watch the ads.
With these new possibilities, users will readily "charge" their web browser LN wallets with 10€ or so (like they charge today their smartphone with 2950 mAh) to enjoy this convenience and increase of productive life time.
Once such micro payments are established, creativity kicks in in the eco-system for new use cases beyond above's examples about this new form of payment that we all dream of since 3rd January 2009, or so.

You do not need a centralized SI system for that. If people use "bit", they create facts without involvement of a standardization organization.
@_date: 2016-11-22 18:06:01


I disagree completely. I think it is MUCH less user friendly and much more confusing to NOT offer such options and leave the desperate user alone and powerless with unconfirmed transactions.
And note that the option would be in the context menu, so it would NOT CLUTTER the GUI. So it wouldn't "confuse" a user because it wouldn't even be visible under normal usage conditions. The user would intuitively long-tap (or right-click) on the unconfirmed TX if he thinks there is some problem with this, and only in this case he would find a context menu item that leads him to a problem resolution dialog. This would be a great enhancement of user experience.    
In short: If the GUI is designed properly, it is not at all more confusing.
On the contrary, what we have today is confusing to the user: Transactions are stuck and there's nothing the user can do about it, except contacting customer support (in case of online wallets) or exporting keys and importing them to a new electrum wallet to initiate a cpfp TX manually, which is MUCH more confusing and will users turn away from Bitcoin.

not necessarily. It depends on the timeout specified for the LN channel.

No, even then it cannot possibly work if you want mainstream adoption:
Bitcoin capacity (3 TX/s) is currently just enough to open or(!) close one Lightning payment channel per each inhabitant on earth per human life time. With SegWit it would be good to open and(!) close one Lightning payment channel per each inhabitant on earth per human life time.
And this does not even include corporate use of the Bitcoin blockchain.
So there is absolutely no way it can possibly work, it is elementary school math. Why cannot people here do elementary school math.
Note that bitcoin core knows this very well, so they think seriously about how to hard-fork some day, and they definitely will.

But core is neither silent nor are they doing nothing. segwit is a good proof. And many core devs are working on future evolution incl. HF for upscaling, see other post in this thread. SegWit release is the beginning, not the end.
So all that core could be accused of is that segwit is coming only as late as nov2016, but delays are normal in software projects, and in a 12B market like Bitcoin it's better to test a bit too much than too little.
But I can understand you, only few weeks/months ago I was also having the impression core is doing "nothing" and wants the on-chain capacity situation to stay, and got confirmed in this view by many vocal (and partly even seemingly convincing) redditors, before I started to step back and look at the other side of the curtain to get a balanced view for myself. And I found out that one side was mainly "loud", while the other side had the much better arguments. But "loud" is better to influence popular opinion, and also I fell for it for a while, certainly reinforced by overly rigid censoring in this subreddit, that made me very angry.

well, of course, yes, but I was assuming a hypothetical (and certainly unrealistic) Bitcoin-based economy. Otherwise, we still have fiat and there would be no point banks give Bitcoin based credits in the first place.

Did you even have a look at the Monte Carlo simulations? And if so, did you understand them? Sorry for the rhetorical question, the obvious answer is "no". That's ok, but then do not talk as if you have a clue.
It shows that it is absolutely expected that every 1-2 months the SegWit hash rate (144 block average) exceeds 35% even though the ACTUAL share of SegWit hash power remains at 25%.


It has twice exceeded 34%, see " on 8 Dec. 2016 and 30 Dec. 2016.


You can believe this of course. But with this "believe" you will be misled every 1-2 months, even if actual SegWit hashrate remains at 25%. This is my point! And that is not debatable, it is a real mathematical provable fact. There are too many "false positives" with your approach, when you think every 1.5 months that you have "reason to believe" that hashrate for SegWit has increased while it actually hasn't at all! Such "false positive" alarms are pre-programmed if you approach the topic the way you do.


No I am not. Of course if REAL SegWit hashrate increases one day, we will exceed 35% naturally. Just from what I wrote above, plus the fact that no miner has announced change in Segwit signalling strategy, strongly suggests that all this is just a statistical effect that lies fully in the realm of statistical expectations, and it makes not sense to write a false alarm headline like this every 1.5 months.
I see no reason whatsoever to believe it is anything other than caused by normal statistical variance. Alone the fact that it surpassed 35% is no evidence at all - in fact surpassing 35% every 1-2 months is what is statistically to be EXPECTED if actual hash SegWit rate remains exactly at 25%. And remember that actual segwit hash rate is at 25% only since beginning of December 2016, so statistically, the 144-block average forming a peak exceeding 35% is overdue (I will write [here]( by editing why the expected value between two 35% peaks with actual hashrate of 25% is more like 1.4 months than 2 months).


I can see that. I hope it is clearer now.


[but it has jumped to 34% twice - just saying!! On 8th and 30th of December 2016 - you did not even observe carefully ;-) ]
Mathematics tell the exact opposite of what you say. It is not unlikely, but on the contrary absolutely expected. I hope this is clear now. ~~The fact that you even say "impossible" (despite the fact it had reached 34% twice already, but you consider 35% "impossible") shows that you do not understand statistical variation and did not look at (or did not understand)~~ my very simple simulation results that is based on the exact same randomness as the block generation statistics, namely purely statistical independence of successive block signallings, with a given statistical expectation.


You should explain what you mean by "P(variance)". It is not clear from your post, please add a distinct mathematical definition before elaborating on this term. Otherwise all the words are in vain. I think you used the term "variance" here in a somewhat lazy way.
I assume that you refer to "variance" as the 144 block average segwit block percentage (not accurate to call this "variance") and with P(variance) you are referring to the probability that the "variance" (or more precisely the percentage of segwit blocks in a 144 block average) surpasses a certain percentage as expressed by the variable "variance".
I will do more simulations and post them [here]( (by editing my main post in this main thread), also adding the probabilities (or frequency) that 144-block-peaks surpass different percentages. Stay tuned.

I tried, but I sincerely cannot follow you here. If we do SegWit now, and then in 1 or 2 years bump into capacity saturation again, and if core is unwilling to do further scaling, the subject of hardfork and BU is on the table again, no less than today, but even more, because there is no SegWit that time to avoid a HF. My clear conclusion is: SegWit today is the right way INDEPENDENTLY of what happens next. And, by the way, it offers much more than just an effective doubling of block size. It offers many further provisions that help scaling, use cases, and growth of bitcoin. I cannot understand how someone interested in bitcoin's mid and long-term growth and value increase could be against SegWit adoption now.

I've been very helpful plenty of times explaining stuff to new users. But your post seemed a bit too provocative to me, with too many obvious false statements in the question that would have needed rectification from the ground. It gives the impression that someone is very lazy, didn't do any research whatsoever(!) upfront, makes some random (false) statement and hopes someone takes private time to correct your false statements. I consider this a misuse of the community. Had you watched only one introductory video on Bitcoin, you would've known that Bitcoin supply is finite, but even that you do not understand.
I do help people with genuine question if I have the impression they do their share. But if I have the impression the questioner is simply lazy and wants to get everything served on a silver tablet with zero work on his own, I feel repelled.
So I have no problems with "stupid" people (your term), i.e. people lacking some knowledge, but with lazy leechers. Hope that helped clarifying things.

If I want to give someone new a crypto expereience, I ask him/her to install litecoin spv wallet for Android (which has the exact same GUI as the bitcoin counterpart) and sell him/her some litecoins for Euros. Then I show and demonstrate how to transfer coins back and forth, with something like 0.1 cent/TX of TX fee.
After he/she learned how to handle it, did backups and restore of the seed as well etc., he/she is ready for Bitcoin.
Perfectly reasonable. Seems you did not think before you wrote and just have fun feeling(!) superior to other people while in fact you are not.

yes. we are already tuning the details here... :-)
Another possibility is that the wallet takes into consideration different factors like nb. of blocks not including the tx, fee/byte of that tx, general fee/byte in the current mem pool, derive from that a kind of likelihood that the tx gets confirmed as-is on 1 hour / 12 h / 24 hours / 7 days or so, and makes this info avalable to the user via the context menu in clear English. This way the user can better judge whether he should expedite the tx now or wait a little bit longer...

You want people to enter their privkey, that's obvious. Despite the warning, 0.1% of users will overlook it, and that's enough for you in absolute numbers! Same "business idea" as for other kinds of phishing.
There is nothing "interesting" about it, as you say. You could equally well generate new private keys yourself and input them to your own tool. Why do you need OTHER people to input THEIR priv keys, other than stealing them? Mathematically/scientifically there is no reason at all!
In Germany we call this "Bauernfängerei".
You know full well that it will NEVER (not even "eventually") be possible to list all keys, no matter how much capacity Google or others scale up, because there are as many priv keys as atoms in the universe (2^256) and as many addresses as atoms on earth (2^160).

**So is the following the recommended best practice for all Trezor owners (current and future)?**
What if I protect my (Trezor) wallet not only by the 24 word mnemonic seed, but also add an optional passphrase?
So the idea is: First I load a few dummy bitcoins onto my wallet w/o password, and thereafter I put my real savings onto the wallet that has the same mnemonic seed plus a well chosen personal password (passphrase).
**This password isn't saved anywhere on the Trezor device, is it?**
If it is not, then it is unlikely to be hacked: If my Trezor gets stolen, the thief is likely to discover my dummy bitcoins and to steals those. He does not even know that there is one (or more!?) other wallets by combining this seed with a passphrase. Even if he tries brute force, it'll take him time.
Meanwhile, the stolen dummy coins warns me, and this gives me enough time to secure my real coins before the thief brute-forces my passphrase (if he even tries, which is unlikely).

I learned a new word - "expedite" ;-)
the 6 in your proposal is arbitrary. It has nothing to do with the "6" for confirmed TXs, and I would be surprised if "6" is also the best choice when to warn that the tx is still unconfirmed. But anyway: yes, probably it makes sense if the wallet checks in the backgroud if a certain incoming/outgoing tx is unconfirmed for too long and e.g. colors the tx in red or so to highlight that the user should "do someting" actively to confirm this TX.

Wait wait, you compare apples with oranges. IOTA whitepaper leaves lots of questions open, but they say - well, we'll solve it later, without explaining how (except giving foggy unconcrete "hints").This is not science. This is pseudo science at best, like those scammers building perpetuum mobilees and zero-energy machines since decades, always coming up with fancy explanations where everything looks conclusive, and just one tiny details yet has to be fixed. That looks convincing to the non-educated majority, but it is that tiny detail that lets the whole building crash!
So what IOTA is doing is by far too little.
Evidently, they are the ones who need to prove they are not a scam. Because it evidently looks very much like a scam. Not only because of this technical argument, but as aside remark, also because of the extreme marketing and shilling. Hardly any crypto youtube channel where you do not find iota scammers and spammers. And here on crypto all bitcoin participators were spammed by private message when iota came up. The social warfare is beyond bad taste. IOTA has it all, and I mean really all, that is characteristics of a scam.
Now if someone claims it is not a scam, that is an extraordinary claim, and I respectfully ask for proof of such a claim.

I think a good wallet should always give the user the choice to set/unset the RBF flag, because depending on the use case there are reasons for both (although I see that the further we look into the future, the less relevant the "RBF flag unset" usecases will become).    
Example 1: online shopping: RBF-flag=true.    
Example 2: LN settlement: RBF-flag=true.    
Example 3: Retailer in the physical world: RBF-flag=false (so 0- conf acceptance is "safe enough" for the retailer to accept in PRACTICAL life).
Only in a (farer) future where usecase example 3 is totally extinct (because e.g. tx fee is &gt; USD 5 and everybody would use LN or a high capa sidechain in retail scenarios), we can forgo the "RBF-flag=false" case, but this may still be many years in the future.

there are other ways, e.g. a "soft hardfork":
it is a proper hardfork that creates new blocks merge-mined with the legacy chain. it only accecpts legacy blocks that are completely empty, and the POW used fir the new chain is inside the legacy blocks. so the old legacy blocks are only used for the proof of work while all the transaction data is moving to a new chain structure that is not backwards compatible.
* No danger of a chain split (in this respect it behaves like a softfork)
* Old clients that don't update will only see empty blocks w/o transactions, so they need to update to keep on participating (in this respect it is more similar to a hardfork)

SegWit is for me especially an improvement of many things, and scaling being just a welcome side effect that allows to postpone the decision for a scaling HF to a future point in time. Therefore, I do not see a scaling-up HF as an adequate alternative to SegWit, because it would lack everything segwit has except the capacity increase. Also note that the complete eco system (e.g. virtually all wallet makers, server software etc.) are already preparing for SegWit.

That's not how it should go. Still waiting for OP to solidify his claims.
I have in my memories that core developers have discussed, in mail exchanges, scaling strategies free of taboos, and hard fork to increase was not a taboo. Just it was considered that for now segwit as a sf is by far the best method, for now, laying the [groundwork for many future evolutions](  ). I never saw any claim that 1MB forever is the intention, on the contrary I saw hard forks for on-chain scaling as future intended steps.
So if OP has firm sources for claiming core's strategy is 1MB forever, it would be very new for me and I'd like to see the sources of information. Thanks.

Probably that's what he meant. But such advice can be very dangerous - "bear trap" - it can just return towards 4000 soon after you sell at 3700. Just look at 21/22 ~~October~~ *August (ooops typo)* a few hours ago, for example... In that case the correct acting was to do the opposite - buy at 3700.

In most cases (politics, technical, economical questions), the best or even most obviously best solutions are not shared by 100% or 95% of the involved people.
human judgement is always subjective - just by nature (Gaussian distribution...). Hence you always have a minority (even for the most "obvious" questions) opposing the "obvious". [Like e.g. 5-10% of ppl believe in adventurous conspiracy theories like Moon landing lie etc.]
I am pessimistic here and think that minority also exists in the SegWit case and amounts to much more than 5%, such that the only solution will be a network split into two bitcoins after escalation and huge damage done to Bitcoin. For similar reasons wars have been started between people, also with losers on all sides eventually. People are not always reasonable.

Not sure what is you point. can you summarize in few words? I have the feeling we don't disagree and you misuderstood sth., but not sure. Probably you interpreted more into my statement than what was my intention.
My bus analogy was only refering to a complaint against some highly dumb people who said in effect: Everybody out of 10000 people can buy a seat in the bus, if only they bid high enough in the ticket auction for the bus tickets of the bus that has only 100 seats :-(
It is clear to every child in kindergarden that no matter what moon prices the 10000 people will offer, not quite all of the 10000 will get a ticket, because (law of math!) - believe it or not:
100 &lt; 10000.
But even this triviality is too difficult to grasp by some hard core small blockers (or they just deny the fact that 100 &lt; 10000). Ridiculous of course.
That's all I complained about. Nothing more! :-)

Ok, NOW I understand your point. (Why not saying it from the beginning and not hiding away?)
So you are fundamentally against SegWit because you are against 2nd layer solutions like LN (which SegWit is an enabler of) (and probably you are also against sidechains for the same reason, which however does not really need SegWit).
So we have a completely different discussion now. But good to know WHAT we are discussing about!
So you think LN is generally bad because it takes revenues away from miners. I am convinced the view is too short-sighted. LN opens up use cases that are completely unfeasible on-chain even for 100 or 1000 MB of block sizes (which would completely centralize Bitcoin of course). And if the foundation (on-chain) network is so valuable that it enables things like LN, that value will also get reflected in tx fees and miner rewards, so it's not like that miners don't benefit from the added value LN brings!

By changing the limit from 21 to 50 Mill, he is changing the Bitcoin protocol's consensus rules. This cannot happen unnoticed, because 1000s of computers with the true (correct) consensus rules are running all around the world that would reject blocks generated acc. to the hacker's new rule set. These blocks simply would not be considered "Bitcoin" blocks.
Technically, this is called a hard fork. The hacker would have to convince the whole world to jump onto this new forked version of the Bitcoin blockchain and leave the legacy rules behind.
Certainly, he would have a hard time to convince everybody.

Interesting. But why should anybody decide to buy a HW wallet at an *airport*? (serious question - I cannot see why, but maybe I simply do not see it at the moment...)
And what if you travel to a country like USA or UK, where they can put you in prison until you to tell the password (at least in UK this is legal by law as far as I know). I think it is really really unwise to carry a HW wallet with you, nowadays - because by that you tell the customs more or less explicitly: "Hello, I am carrying an undeclared amount of cryptos 'into' your country." (well, the 'into' is not quite correct, technically, but the customs will see it like that!)
So I think it is just a question of time until we can hear from the first case where the customs ask the passenger to declare the cryptos by disclosing them the balance - and forcing to give the private key if that balance is too high.
And then I am curious to see what the first court decision in that country will be: Is carrying a HW (or SW) wallet of cryptos into a country really equivalent to carrying true money into the country? And after long negotiations, the court ruling will be (if it is a country with a really independent court): No, it is no equivalent, because the passenger only carries a *key* to the cryptos into the country, not the money equivalent *itself*! The passenger could equally well carry that key in his mind, and that would be absurd to consider illegal!
Then this court ruling will cause much uproar amongst the main stream media - hear hear - and it will be discussed... only then will the mainstream understand what "borderless" money really means.
It is clear - all this will happen, that is the way new technology is introduced to the mainstream - just a question of time...

I agree. "Prefer". But *IF* the sender has already made a non-rbf TX which then turns out to be "stuck", cpfp is the only way out.


Yes, this was also a comment of another reply here. In principle I agree. I just thought, as a first step (i.e. instead of having no cpfp support at all) the "per TX treatment" would already be a big step forward. I figure that upon such context menu selection, the wallet could check independently and automatically if other 0-conf TXs than the one selected are pending in this wallet and give the user options correspondingly, to bumb those TXs as well, maybe in form of a list of TXs and their likelihood of not getting confirmed, and then the user can check/uncheck which TXs to bump. Yes, this would be neat.
@_date: 2016-11-22 23:39:32
no, cpfp can be applied in BOTH cases, exactly the way I described (although CPFP is mentioned mainly for the RX use case, but this is not my fault!).
And CPFP can accelerate ALL transactions, also those which are NOT flagged as RBF (=almost all tx today). RBF wouldn't help you at all for these transactions where the RBF flag is not set.

I know - for the same reason people of small states are over-represented in the EU in many organisations.
interestingly, many US states have the regulation that their electoral college has to vote 100% for the candidate with the US wide popular vote majority (as opposed to the state's majority vote), **if** so many other states have the same law that it amounts to 270 votes in el. college. As of now, the number of states with this law amounts to only some 160 votes in el. college, not yet 270, so the law is not yet "active", but it may activate in the future if the 270 threshold is passed as more states define a similar law.

And as a sender, you can only use it if the tx is RBF-flagged upfront. Normal TXs are never RBF-flagged by default, so if you send a normal TX, and you later want to "expedite" it, CPFP is the ONLY way to achieve it.
Of course, an intelligent GUI should, in the context menu of a stuck outgoing TX, offer RBF *IF* the TX is RBF-flagged, and only offer CPFP (utilizing the own change) if it is not RBF-flagged.
In summary:
* For a recipient, RBF never helps. CPFP does.
* For a sender, RBF never helps for "normal" transactions. CPFP does.

Not to mention that bitcoin would need MUCH more capacity than VISA today to serve as payment method for mass adoption. Add all cash payments, MasterCard payments and future machine to machine payments (!) to today's VISA levels.
But the dumb masses (incl. Roger Ver) are not cabable enough to see these visions and the needed for corresponding protocol changes (SegWit) to enable these evolutions.

Quite true. But there are a few exceptions from the earlier days (or years) that keep up these values. I'd count Monero as one of them, and maybe even more a little know coin called "Vertcoin" that exists since April 2014 and is technically like Litecoin plus committed to ASIC free mining via algo combined with social contract to HF to stay ASIC free. It was built on exact these ideals of decentralization and openess, very much unlike all these ICO scams we see today. It does not compromise anywhere. So its intention is to be even more decentralized than Bitcoin. This coin has no pre-mine or instamine, no paid marketing team, it did not do any financing but is a free open source community project like Bitcoin.
One may argue whether the idea of ASIC-freeness is good or bad (good because no potential accumulation of power for big HW manufacturers, bad because more prone to bot nets). But at least it is a coin in good spirit, very much unlike all these modern coins that make compromises on these values.

your ~~arguments~~ *words* are not pragmatic and foggy - please get a clear view first. LN is not something that core will ever deliver, because it is a protocol on top of Bitcoin. Please learn about this before forming an opinion. Also it is not up to core to decide whether bitcoin will become a settlement layer. But if we do not scale (as is the case at the moment with the deadlock) it will get a settlement layer for sure.
Your words are those of an irritated person in loss of orientation and overview. Don't let this happen to you. Instead, read and acquire knowledge. It is effort, but you feel much better afterwards.

That's right. I am not saying it is no problem. Just interested in showing the actual situation - I have no ideological agenda.
Clearly, having the possibility to keep LN channel open indefinitely and having a relative instead of a-priori set absolute expiry time is an advantage.
But equally clear of course it is still a problem if the network is congested / fees are very high. And I think I have explained that in my first post above already because I thought it is important to mention for a balanced view, so no need to repeat here.

Maths is not your strength as it seems. Good luck in [more than] doubling world hash rate.
To be clear (because you probably don't understand):
If world hashrate is 100 hash_rate_units, of which viaBTC is 10 hash_rate_units, then to make these 10% hashrate 5% of world hashrate, you need to increase total world hashrate from 100 to 200 hash_rate_units, i.e. you need to increase NON-ViaBTC hashrate from 90 to 190 hash_rate_units, i.e. increase it by 111%.
Summary: To decrease ViaBTC Hashrate from 10% to 5% you need to increase world hashrate of non-ViaBTC miners by 111%, i.e. more than double it. Good luck.
Conversely, if you simply but the same amount of ViaBTC hashrate on top for non-BTC hashrate, you have still 10 hash_rate_units for ViaBTC but 100 instead of 90 hash_rate_units of non-ViaBTC. This reduces ViaBTC market share form 10/100 = 10% to 10/110 = 9.1%, which does not change a lot.
Since this mathemathics is already too much for you and the rBTC dumbsters (I know not all writing on rBTC are dumbsters, so I am referring particularly to those who are), I am not surprised that your rBTC friends like Roger Ver and others always come up with recipes that are resistant to any mathematical or factual reality.

that's what I remember, yes. one miner (&gt;5%) said loud and clear it will NEVER accept segwit in its current form w/o bl. sz. increase @ the same time (I don't have a link at hand now). But bl.sz. increase as a HF in a safe way (without risk of a blockchain fork) requires much more time and study ("soft hard fork" concept), so I see segwit not come into play before 2018, probably more like 2019 at earliest. By that time, Litecoin will long have segwit activated already and bitcoin is stuck - desasterous for the eco system - "interesting" to see what will happen...

It happened end of 2013 in MtGox.
The Dollars locked in MtGox were worth less than free USD. As a result, people bought BTC for their questiobable MtGox Dollars in their MtGox accounts.
This caused BTC on MtGox to have a substantial premium over other exchanges like e.g. Bitstamp.
As a result, this drove BTC price up above $1000 for the first time.

True, but with Bitcoin a fractional reserve banking practice would be much more difficult/dangerous because no lender of last resort (central bank) could bail out a private bank by creating new money out of thin air, if anything goes wrong.
Also, the practices of lending fractional IOUs on Bitcoin for interest would soon reach its limits if the underlying is a resource of limited supply, because it would be impossible that all borrowers paid back their credits incl. interest, simply because the money is not there. So they'd have to pay back with new Bitcoin credits that the banks give them again in an unbacked (fractional reserve) manner, and this ways the IOU-money supply would be expended indefinitely wihtout(!) the underlying's real supply growing (as Bitcoin supply is limited). As the fractional reserve rate would tend to 0% this way, it would be only a question of time until the whole system crashed.
There would be only one way to avoid this outcome in a Bitcoin-based system: Keeping the fractional reserve ratio extremely conservative, and being extremely conservative with giving credits.

Becauses the masses of home miners are not visionaries and are hence not able to see the need for SegWit as an enabler for future evolution. Instead they are receptive for the populistic "simple" answers of the segwit blockers.
Visionaries of new trends and revolutions (like electricity, cars, iPhone, or Bitcoin itself) have always been individuals or small groups. You cannot get it by "95% majority consensus" - hence SegWit is doomed to fail and maybe litecoin which implements segwit is replacing bitcoin long term - who knows...

You gave a very different impression, also in other comments. Not sure what is the purpose.


Maybe you are underestimating many people, and they see the pros&amp;cons better than what you expect. It's no big intellectual achievement to understand the points you are naming. I think your comments are not perceived as constructive by the educated redditors. Now the economy/eco system has to make a decision: Activate SegWit, yes or no. After weighing the pros and cons, every miner has to decide. There is no "perhaps", there is only "yes" or "no". After making my due dilligence I clearly see the "yes". And I have reiterated all the time that it is of course not THE final solution but it is a major necessary step for future evolution, whatever these are. But rejecting/blocking SegWit now despite its strategic advantages is really irresponsible, if the properties of SegWit are understood. Blocking segwit now and thereby hindering evolutions for L2 networks (which are necessary anyway sooner or later) would be absolutely counter-productive and harmful for Bitcoin's value proposition.

PS: My question might actually be interesting despite not related to actual TX mix, because from users personal (egoistic) point of view it answers how much I save in TX fees when using a wallet supporting segwit.
Example: If the answer to my OP question is: "With SegWit 50% (=factor 1.5) more of such TXs would fit into the blocks with segwit being active 100%", then it implies saving 33% in TX fees (e.g. paying 6c instead of 9c) when using SegWit feature of my wallet.
(33% = 1/1.5)
So it demonstrates and quantifies the personal incentive to use a segwit compliant Bitcoin wallet.

yeah, because gold is historically THE alternative currency  and silver is only  at best.
This shows that the "premium" that the gold price has over its "intrinsic" value is much higher for gold than for silver (or conversely much lower for silver than for gold).
This should be worrying to gold bugs like Peter Schiff who always points out that Gold has intrinsic value as opposed to Bitcoin. But if he were honest he had to confess that by far the greatest part of Gold's valuation is not due to its intrinsic value but only due to speculation. And by accepting this as a reality, he would also have to accept that Bitoin's valuation is no less "real" than the valuation of gold.

There's a balance of different market forces, all of which are difficult to predict and some of which suggest that block size increase or decrease is better for the miners. Hence you will hear 5 opinions if you ask 3 people...
Some market forces:
* [as you say:] (short-term) smaller block --&gt; more competition -&gt; higher fee -&gt; higher miner revenues
* above bullet conversely
* (mid&amp;long-term) smaller block -&gt; higher fees -&gt; less users -&gt; less attractive network, less utility -&gt; dropping market value -&gt; lower miner revenues
* above bullet conversely
* (mid&amp;long-term) larger blocks -&gt; more users -&gt; same competitive situation as before on fee market --&gt; same fee per tx but more nb. of tx/block -&gt; higher miner revenues
* above bullet conversely
* (long-term) larger blocks -&gt; more resource demanding -&gt; less decentralized -&gt; less secure -&gt; less value -&gt; lower miner revenues
* above bullet conversely
* (long-term) larger blocks -&gt; more users -&gt; bigger eco-system -&gt; more nodes -&gt; more secure -&gt; more value -&gt; higher miner revenues
* above bullet conversely
Now it's clear why there are so many opinions:
1. Each individuum weights these different factors differently.
2. Each individuum sees the equilibrium/optimum of each criterion at a different point.
3. Each individuum also has a personal guts feeling and/or ideological bias not explainable by words.
4. Every individuum is informed differently.
==&gt; As a result, it is no surprise AT ALL that each one comes up with a different overall evaluation.
PS: I upvoted, because sober analysis of these factors of influence is key to understand why there cannot possibly be agreement and helps us all to better understand the different viewpoints.

by the way, the simplest solution TODAY is to adopt segwit - it is simple (despite other fud), well tested and available today. all other alternatives do not have this quality. and accepting SegWit now does not at all preclude further scaling in the future - on the contrary. so activate SegWit now, it is simpler and safer than ANY other scaling solution today, just do it.

Thank you for this writeup. Very good for a quick overview.
Just one remark...:




...while this is true in principle, we should be aware of two posdible pitfalls here:
1. If I broadcast my state to the blockchain, all my money *minus tx fees* is returned to me. While today this fee is low, it is likely to become much higher as bitcoin gains popularity. This may become important when considering scenarios like these.
2. If I don't regularly observe the blockchain while the "other side" of the LN channel broadcasts an obsolete version of the state to the blockchain thereby trying to defraud me, I may lose bitcoins. However, if I recognize it in time, I can enforce a penalty paid by the attacker to me (as far as I understood - can anybody confirm?)
@_date: 2016-12-11 21:46:47


FTFY. The trials and tests for gaining understanding by doing would become too expensive otherwise ;) I see it for myself: In the past I did a lot of test TX to myself between different wallets etc. to learn how things go. Nowadays I better do the tests with testnet coins whenever possible.

Constant tail emission is an advantage because it ensures a future point where lost coins == new coins in balance. This ensures a coin is de facto inflation AND deflation free. Also it ensures miner income even with few tx fees. In contrast, Bitcoin is deflationary and must rely exclusively on Tx fees, making it more susceptible.

but IBM uses a private one, which makes the purpose of blockchain futile.


It was possible. E.g. git. A git commits' hash is a function of the previous hash, so it is a chain, too. The chain is also immutable, because if someone changes an earlier commit, its hash is changed. This breaks the chain of hashes! So it cannot be altered unnoticed.

A few corrections below:


it is not irrational to sell and buy 2x the amount  of bitcoins back when price is lower.


You just created your own definition of the word "futures".


that reasonable value could very well be in the range of $300.


If money velocity increases bitcoin price would fall because more bitcoins are available on the market thanks to the increased velocity. this effectively increases supply. The opposite is most people hodling. In this case, their bitcoins are not on the market so supply is lower, increasing price.

From google translate:
A 91 year old woman in Kristianstad may not redeem the 108,000 she saved. The bank refused to accept the notes, because the woman could not explain where they came from. Now give the administration the right bank the right.
The woman saved the first money in the drawer, because she did not trust banks. Then in a safety deposit box.
The bills, however, had gone out, and when the woman turned 90, she wanted to redeem them to live a little more luxurious retirement.
But because the woman had no proof of where they came from, the bank refused to receive notes with reference to the Riksbank's regulations.
The woman appealed
The woman appealed to the Administrative Court. She writes that she is not a criminal and not present a criminal record. She has lived efficient and economical, and now wanted to splurge a little during his last years of life.
The woman wrote that she sold the car, gold, jewelry and clothing. At first she thought the money for a trip, but when that did not happen, the money was lying in the drawer and later in banking union.
According to the Riksbank needs a person not to have been convicted of a crime for redemption of banknotes to be denied.
The appeal rejected
The bank has repeatedly asked the woman to come in with a written certificate of origin of the funds, but this has not happened.
The Administrative Court has now taken the decision in the case. Court allows no other conclusion than the Riksbank and reject the appeal.

* Bitcoin is fungible, a Fiat 500 should not be confused with a Ferrari
* Bitcoins can be stolen online or offline, Fiats only offline
* Bitcoin cannot be duplicated, Fiats can. Except my Fiat.
* Bitcoin is international, Fiat is Italian
* Bitcoin can be accelerated with lightning, Fiat with gaz.
* Bitcoin runs on electricity, Fiat mainly on fossile fuels
* A Bitcoin appreciates in value over time, a Fiat oxidized over time.

no inverse formula.
the seed words are generated randomly. the last seed word(s) are checksum words.
the private keys (plural!) are calculate from the seed via a given algorithm.
the other direction is not possible I think.
my understanding. anyone expert can confirm?
Why I think so: I saw a java script tool where you could enter the seed words and the tool generated the private master key and the individual private keys and pub keys and addresses from it.
You could als enter the private master key directly, and again it calculated individual priv&amp;pub keys &amp; addresses from it, but it could not generate the seed words from it.
I think the mathematical  function is a one-way function.

Already with a weak password that can be attacked with a dictionary of 100,000 words, total entropy would be increased by &gt; 16 bits, from 128 to &gt; 144 bits, right? And a second such password (i.e. passphrase + concatenation of passwords 1 and 2), if uncorrelated, would bring it to &gt; 160 bits already, right?
@_date: 2019-06-01 12:24:03
From my calculations (see other replies here) I think even a rather weak password (32 bits of entropy) would be sufficient to lift overall entropy from  128 bit to 160 bit and would thereby lift the overall security of my seed to that of a private key itself.
Ok, today 128 bits are considered safe enough, but if I am a bit paranoid, I think it is worthwhile to add a moderately complex 13th password to get an overall entropy of 160+ bits for my seed.
This way, the weakest link for a brute force attacker would no longer be the (12-word) seed - he could equally well just try to attack a private key directly.

bitcoin today is a human solution: humans decentrally socially agree to accept bitcoin following the decentralised ruleset that they defined. And that is good.
If, in the event of a threat/attack, the rule set once defined does not work any more and humans are unable to adapt, if humans want to be ruled by a once self-defined rule set and commands itself to disable their own ability to adapt, then they have not deserved better than to lose Bitcoin.

*"it's hard to determine how many actual bits of entropy it contains"*
It's not hard to give a lower bound estimate. Assume the password is very weak and consists of six letters (all lower case or all upper case, representing initials of a person and his/her parents) preceded or followed by a 6-digit sequence representing the person's birthday. Already this gives us 35 bits of entropy. This is horribly low for a stand-alone password, but a nice entropy-boost for a 12-word-seed:     
128 bits --&gt; 163 bits
Having birthdays as passwords already gives 366 possibilities for the ddmm and say at least 50 possibilities for the yy (consider only living people of the younger generation, conservative estimate). That is 366\*50 = **18,300** possibilities already, not taking different date formats into account like ddmmyy vs yymmdd or mmddyy.
Add initials of three names (person, father, mother), all lowercase or all uppercase, before or after the birthday, and ignore the entropy added by 2 of these 6 letters because related people often have the same surname, gives 2\*2\*26^(6-2) = **1,827,904** combinations on top.
So this gives a total of **33.45 Billion** possibilities already, equating to **35 bits** of additional entropy. And this is an extremely conservative entropy estimate for poor 12-character passwords consisting of initials of names and birthdays only, i.e. extremely weak passwords.
This brings the total entropy of a 12-word-seed plus password to **128+35 = 163 bits**.

I agree. But this would be a pain, because wallet sw has to monitor BOTH chains. This would render the value proposition of the small chain (the one keeping the 1MB block size) void, because to properly work on "smallchain", wallet or client sw must monitor "bigchain", and to be sure that the correct bigchain is monitored, smallchain wallets would have to also verify bigchain blocks. So the value proposition of smallchain is gone, one could equally well operate directly on bigchain (or move to an altcoin that has a limited blocksize in its "constitution".

Interestingly, if the attacker eventually stops mining his useless chain, the honest chain will become the longest chain again, so the "fork" will unfork again, because no consensus rules were changed permanently. This is different to the hard forks that lead to two permanent chains, like ETC, BCH, BSV, BTG, BCD, SBTC, etc.


How can a takeover be "slowly / gradually"? Can you elaborate on that? Because I do not quite understand what you mean by that. Forking is always black or white  this or that chain, no way in between. So what do you mean by "gradually"?

A scammer taking advantage of on error that a wallet maker made.
proof: Could not provide proof of his 17 lost btc and other crypto. and was allegedly dumb enough to enter his seed on a windows pc in the first place.
instead he made a deadline for paying him 17 btc.
if he'd be honest, he ...
* would have made his losses transparent,
* and would have given coinomi enough time
* and wouldn't have set a deadline like a blackmailer.

...if we continue this thought experiment about "international checkpointing", it gets interesting...:
Imagine that international community had agreed about such checkpointing mechanisms to defend 51% attack, and it works properly for years.
Then, years later someone in a then-powerfull country (say e.g. China) has the idea: Hey, we can use this checkpointing also for censoring terrorist funding or other undesired transactions, e.g. also for blacklisting certain addresses that we want to block. I.e. if we discover an "unwanted" TX in a block, we'll just set a checkpoint such as to declare that block invalid.
Then what? Maybe rest of the world does not agree with this unilaterally decided checkpointing policy. So in this case we'd have a chain split: While "Rest of world" accepts the "longest chain" constrained only by the "51%-attack-defending checkpoints", China empire accepts only the chain that also follows their "censoring" checkpoints.
In that case, we'd in fact have two parallel Bitcoins from that monent on. In this case, assuming that "China empire" and "Rest of world" economies are of similar size, the two block chains would also grow at similar speeds - maybe one one day China chain is longer, and next day ROW chain (rest of world) is longer... Then the "longest chain" rule would be broken forever, both chains would rely on checkpointing forever, from that point on, also long-term.
This observation may lead to the conclusion "why do we need POW at all? Why not completely transition to pure checkpointing?" And this would mean having a centrally controlled FED-coin sort of currency once again.
This would be the moment when Bitcoin has failed. Of course many decades from now. That's when another Satoshi will have to rise up and create another decentralized currency again but this time not secured by POW but by some other yet t.b.d. mechanisms...

No, BTC decentralisation would not be affected.
Or are you talking about centralization of RSK? Sure, just like BCH is more centralized. But RSK is L2 while BCH is L1.
L2 is allowed to have another "centralization vs. capacity" trade-off than L1. If a certain L2 technology is messing up by too much centralization, another L2 can take over. If L1 messes up, the chain is done. The article is really worth reading.

I see your point, because I felt exactly the same. And I am not here to defend core, because I cannot speak for them and their members. But I am not as pessimistic as you are.
I am also acknowledging that at the time in 2015 when the first ideas were expressed on scaling on-chain, the complete topic was not yet researched thoroughly in the beginning. I assume that some people that made proposals at that time do not support their own proposals any more, and this not necessarily because they were influenced by malvolent characters or forces, but because they have learned and understood a lot that they did not see in the beginning of the process.
I know that such learning curve is more than common and natural, and especially in a complex matter as this it would surprise me if not one or another scientifically credible individual has changed their opinion or conviction in the meantime, for purely scientific reasons, because of new findings, studies, simulations etc. By the way, I am one of these (less-known) individuals myself. So I would not necessarily derive from the fact that some idividuals do not support their own early proposals any more, that malicious intent is the root cause for this. 
@_date: 2015-08-02 16:37:22
Oh, your arguments are really stunningly convincing! (this is *irony* - in case you did not realize)
Here is a VERY last try (although I am almost sure you are a troll), just in case it is just that statistics and combinatorics is not your friend:
Let's take a simple example, and let's for simplicity replace the "7" by a "2" (2of2 multisig).
Let's further assume that the attacker knows a-priori that each password has a length between 1 and 3 characters and that the alphabet is binary, i.e. only 0 and 1 can be used a characters.
Q1.: Now, how many "checks" does the attacker have to do to crack the Multisig wallet?
A.1: Well, each password, the first and the second, can have 2+4+8 = 14 possibilities:
- 2 possibilities of 1 character, namely 0 or 1.
- 4 possibilities of 2 characters, namely 00, 01, 10 or 11.
- 8 possibilities of 3 characters, from 000 to 111
So, in combination, there are 14 x 14 = 196 possibilities how your 2of2 multisig-wallet can be protected. The brute-force-attacker hence needs 196 tries to brute-force your wallet.
Now to the single-sig wallet:
Here we assume that the password is constructed as a character sequence "A-B" (the "-" is an explicit character), where A and B are each character strings of size 1 to 3, containing characters 0 or 1 only. So the password can for example be equal to "11-0" or "001-101".
Let's further assume that the attacker knows a-priori that the password is constructed according to above principle.
Q2.: Now, how many "checks" does the attacker have to do to crack this single-sig wallet?
A.2: Well, each sub-password, the first (A) and the second (B), can have 2+4+8 = 14 possibilities:
- 2 possibilities of 1 character, namely 0 or 1.
- 4 possibilities of 2 characters, namely 00, 01, 10 or 11.
- 8 possibilities of 3 characters, from 000 to 111
So, for the whole password, which consists of a combination of two sub-passwords separated by a "-" character, there are 14 x 14 = 196 possibilities. The brute-force-attacker hence needs 196 tries to brute-force your single-sig wallet.
That's the same as the multi-sig wallet.
Final note: My example shows that I even made a comparison in favour of the multi-sig wallet, because I assume that the attacker of the single-sig wallet knowas a-prior that the separator character between the sub-passwords is a "-". In practice, he would not know this and had to check also for &lt;space&gt;, &lt;comma&gt;, &lt;comma space&gt; and other typical characters.
This means that in practice, your Bitcoins are even BETTER protected in a single-sig wallet when you construct it according to the scheme "passw1-passw1-passw3-...-passw7".
As said, all this assumes that one check of multi-sig wallet takes the same CPU time as one check of single-sig wallet. If the multi-sig check is slower by a factor "f", the result has to be biased by this linear (not exponential!) factor.
Wishing you all the best for your future life.

oops - these are not complete sentences. If you order your thoughts and words properly, you can't avoid finding out that cut of supply has an upward effect on the price.
Purpose of my q. was "forcing you" to become aware of your own arguments.


previous price highs have the unit "USD" (or EUR if you prefer).
The demand cannot be quantified by a fiat price tag alone.
So the statement "demand is lower than previous price highs" as such makes no sense, and you cannot do any argument based on that or derive conclusions from that. Again, precise language helps precise thinking and avoid flawed statements.


"there are more sellers than buyers" is another imprecise phrase. despite reading it everywhere, or is intrinsically flawed and needs to be replaced by a proper statement.

No, these are completely different things!
The first point was about combinatorics, i.e. about how many combinations have to be checked.
The second point was about cpu time required for a single attempt of checking one passphrase (singlesig) or set of 7 pass phrases (multisig) respectively.


Are you trolling?? Of course that's nonsense! The longer/more complicated the passphrase, the more complex the task, because the amount of possibilities to be tried increases exponentially with the length and complexity.


...more difficult than what? Than breaking a single-sig brain wallet that has one of those 7 phrases as passphrase, yes. But that's not what we are comparing here.
This is combinatorics: Also single password brute force attack increases exponentially as the length of the password increases.
Example: Assume your seven simple passwords are:
"one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six" and "seven".
What is the brute force effort to crack a 7of7 multi-sig wallet with these seven passwords, as compared to cracking a single-sig wallet whose password is the character string "one-two-three-four-five-six-seven"?
If you are still saying the single sig wallet is easier to hack because it has less combinatoric choices than the multi sig wallet, I am afraid I cannot help you any more. Then you are succumbing to a combinatoric fallacy.
*Remark: I am really surprised again and again that some people are incapable of admitting mistakes. It is impossible to discuss with such people on a technical basis, this inability of admitting flaws is much worse and much more shame, than having made an individual mistake on one particular technical matter, and admitting it. In fact, the latter is no shame at all.*

Seems like a misunderstanding, maybe I was not clear enough, sorry for that.
You are taking differen pre-assumption than me for this "bus argument".
You say there is no way to find out if a passenger (or the group of 5000) have malicious intentions.
My point was starting from the assumption that it *is known* that they have malicious intentions and want to ride the bus with the sole purpose of congesting the busses and harming the bus company to convince people it's better to buy bikes or train tickets (e.g. because they announce it publically on their web site). THIS is the case I am talking about, and here you cannot say "nobody knows", because by definition the PRE-CONDITION is that EVERYBODY KNOWS. Otherwise we are discussing different scenarios here.
And *IF* it is known and proven, then I could imagine that it is considered a criminal offense in certain jurisdictions, esp. in jurisdictions that also ban 6 year old boys from schools for sexual harassment by kissing a girl in the class on the cheek once.
By the way, I think many downvoters did not vote against my commens but against 1MB permanent limit, and they think I am indirectly justifying the "small blocks forever" argument. Let me clarify: I don't at all! On the contrary, we see already now what happens when people get forced off-chain, e.g. a guy who is rejected to withdraw his bitcoins from Circle who changed their terms&amp;conditions at will, arbitrarily and without notice. So we definitely need a size limit increase to keep the system open, decentralized and free. But we should use the RIGHT arguments for that, and CoinWallet's approach is the completely wrong way in my opinion.

Mycelium for Android. It has the best security concept, guides you all the way for backing up your keys and verifying your backup in a way you cannot really do your backup wrong. It supports HD wallets as well as individual keys and watch only keys, supports sweeping of keys (e.g. paper wallets), has an address book, good key management, and it calculates the tx fee adaptively acc. to the current state of the mem pool, and you can still select how to prioritize your transaction. Finally it needs only little resources on your phone.
There are more great and partly unique features about Mycelium that I did not mention.
As number two I recommend Bither (Android + iOS) - it can be used as normal smartphone Bitcoin wallet, but also as truely cold storage when installed  on your 2nd (old!?) fully offline(!) smartphone, a unique feature!
Note: Bither and Mycelium are compatible in that they can mutually restore the wallet backed up from the other app respectively (both support the bip39 standard for HD wallets).

hello dskloet,
I think, aside from all the confusion that two blockchains claiming to be "Bitcoin" would cause, with all the confusion in address name spaces etc., there is one concrete technical problem with this, which renders this idea infeasible:
Assume you have some "pre-fork" bitcoins in address 1A. Now, after the fork we have blockchains BC1 and BC2. You want to transfer 0.1 BTC from address 1A to address 1B on chain BC1. So you startup your BC1 client, and perform the transaction. The client will **sign** the transaction and broadcast it to the BC1 network.
So far so good. But here's the problem:
Any person (or computer program) in the world can read your signed transaction on BC1 and **rebroadcast it into the other blockchain**, BC2, because the signature is fully valid on BC2 as well. This way, you have transferred coins also in chain BC2 against your will, and there's no way you can really prevent this.

In principle I tend to agree.
To avoid that it takes too long, preparation could help accelerate the "slow" system. For example, if I were one of those influencers who have a say in the social community, I would set up an alarm system, sucht that my full node sends me an instance message, wherever I am, when certain criteria are met (e.g. node detects a reorg by more than n blocks).
I'd also react quickly contacting my co-influencers on all continents/geographies to synch the reaction, asap, by having prepared my addressbook for this case.
So certain formalized preparation would help reacting faster.

If bitcoin core changed the rules completely but did this within bitcoin core, he would be ok. If another group makes small adaptations in the sense of keeping the original idea of bitcoin, and giving this another NAME, he opposes by draconical censorship. Needless to say that, if the same happened within bitcoin core, he would have no problem.
Seems that the bitcoin core repository is sort of sacred to him...

Same situation here, long long long time Bitstamp customer with casual trading, nothing special, no problems.
I got these very same questions asked in Nov/Dec 2017 already, but not via such form but via "free text" in the area of incoming/outgoing messages. It happened after I made a small trade after some time of idle time. I finally answered most of their questions, I did NOT answer the question about my net worth or income I think. I also had troubles predicting my future activity behaviour because I did not really know. After answering everything, it took many many months of silence into 2018 until I suddenly got a positive acknowledge. Ironically, I did not make a single trade there again ever since. F\*\*\* them.
During this waiting time I moved my trading activities end of 2017 (which consisted of selling a few long-term holdings of btc) to another European platfom with no such obstacles (bitcoin.de).
These questions appear really shady to me and far exceed what I consider necessary for kyc purposes.

That would mean choosing the vote that was voted most? That would be the stupidest of all ideas. Why? Example: Remaining 60% of votes (=6 votes in this example) are:
~~1.0 2.0~~ 3.00 3.00 10.01 10.02 10.03 10.04 ~~20.0 21.0~~
So in this case 3.0 would be chosen acc. to this logic, because this exact number occurs twice, while all other votes occur only once. Conversely, in the following case 10.0 would be chosen:
~~1.0 2.0~~ 3.00 3.01 3.02 3.03 10.0 10.0 ~~20.0 21.0~~
It needs no further explanation to see what arbitrary nonsense this is.

Neither. It is stating the amount of liqidity in the Lightning Network.
Imagine 50 people that pay Euros to each other. Each of them has, say, 12 Euros of cash in their wallet.
That means the total liquidity is 12 x 50 = 600 Euros.
How much money can be transacted per hour or per day is a separate question you cannot answer from this liquidity metric alone. Theoretically, there is no limit. If money changes hands quickly, it would be posd8ble that the total amount of transacted Euros per day is 6000 Euros, or 60,000 Euros, or even more, while the total liquidity remains at 600 Euro.

Just recently they forced a user to exchange his fiat for btc and withdraw the bitcoins, but the user wanted and needed the fiat. but if the user cannot exchange his crypto for fiat, the "exchange" is not worth its name.
And it goes on and on like that with Kraken. Scandal news all the way...

This post is highly underrated.
Once the rootstock sidechain with low tx fees SBTC tokens are operational, people will quickly ask questions like:
* What is a sidechain anyway?
* Why did nobody tell me about sidechains before?
* Which wallet supports sbtc tokens? (e.g. Coinomi?)
* Which exchange offers sbtc/btc (for exchanging just small amounts like 5 USD worth, using such exchange is more attractive than using the on-chain 2-way-peg, due to onchain btc tx fees. The rest will settle via arbitrages, making sure exch.rate is always close to 1.00).
* Which merchants will accept sbtc?
* What do I need BCH for now, if sidechain tokens (sbtc) offer even better "cash" properties, like low tx fees, much higher capa than BCH, 10 sec block times?
* Where can I quickly sell my BCH to buy more BTC or SBTC?

I did not ridicule anything, I just gave several possible reactions.
So what I take from your view is that Bitcoin is an experiment that is doomed. It will fail, the question is not if but when.
You could be right.
My hope is that a layer of social control, organized in a sufficiently decentralized way, can ensure Bitcoin to exist. The thing is that the layer that controls against evil 51% chains must become active only under very rare conditions, and otherwise pow just does its job. It is a surveillance layer on top of pow. that is different from a gremium that confirms every single block. The latter would represent a clearly much higher degree if centralisation.

the point is to not scale faster than technology for exactly this reason. However not scaling up at all is unnecessary. I.e. the degree of decentralization you have today with 1 MB base size will be the same for a n MB base size in 10 years.
When saying "technology", it should be the minimum of factors due to CPU, bandwidth, storage.
So the minimum of growth rate of these three should determine the block size increase.

Thank you, very good post, at last someone understood that removing the upper and lower 20% makes no sense if afterwards a minimum of the remainder is chosen.
In the end, one should use the term **quantile** instead: BIP 100 seems to take the 20% quantile of the votes, i.e. that vote where 20% are below it.
The BAD thing about QUANTILE VOTING is (except 50% quantile!):
If it is the 20% quantile, it means that a mining minority of 20.1% can downvote the block size limit arbitrarily. Similarly, if the rule was that the 80% quantile decides, then a minining minority of 20.0% could upvote the block size limit arbitrarily. So, to prevent any such "minority voting attacks", the ONLY reasonable quantile value is 50%, which is the median. Probably Jeff Garzik did not think about this to the end, otherwise he would have come up with a clearer suggestion, and particularly with a clearer and less ambiguous language.
Another possibility is to use averages after removing the top X% and bottom Y%, e.g. X=Y=20%. Then a miner minority can cause less harm but still influence the end-result decisively. So, simply taking the median (50% quantile) instead seems to be the simplest and most robust solution, because even 49% of manipulative miners wouldn't cause a bad voting result.

So whenever I give away a master public key, the corresponding private master key can be bruted with 128 bit entropy? (no matter how many words my bip39 seed phrase used?)
If I keep my master pub key secret, how can any attacker "eavesdrop or reveal" it?!?


So 8 characters make at least 10 bit extra entropy. better than nothing. (I doubt that there are only 1024 8-character passwords, even if just considering human chosen passwords, so I think 10 bit is an extremely conservative estimate *)
Anyway, seems irrelevant because we are always stuck at 128 bit from your earlier argument above, which is a big claim that needs more proof.
\*) Edit: Having Birthdays as passwords already gives 366 possibilities for the ddmm and say at least 50 possibilities for the yy. That is 18300 already, not taking different date formats into account like ddmmyy vs yymmdd or mmddyy. Add initials of names, all lowercase or all uppercase, before or after the birthday, gives 2\*2\*26^2 = 2704 combinations on top. So this gives 49,483,200 possibilities already, equating to 25.56 bits of additional entropy. And this is an extremely conservative entropy estimate for 8-character passwords consisting of initials of names and birthdays only, i.e. extremely weak passwords. This brings entropy to more than 128+25 = 153 bits. This proves your statement about self-chosen passwords fully wrong for practical usage.

you can take mycelium, bither, coinomi, ... all good. all support backups and HD wallets acc. to BIP39.
All have pros and cons, but all have pin/password protection.
Mycelium is the most thought-through app and guides you the way for backing up and verifying the backup best. Also other features are well thought-through, and you can add watch-only addresses and an address book.
Bither has awesome feature like cold wallet (if you have an old offline smartphone for ultimate security...) but its UI is not the simplest one for beginners.
Coinomi has the simplest UI and still all necessary features, plus support for the most popular altcoins (plus super simple altcoin exchange built-in without need for an account) and worthless testnet coins to try out things.
The bip39 HD wallet backus of either of these three can also be restored on the others, so in principle you could install all three and run the same bitcoin on either of them, which gives good diversity in case one wallet has a bug.
Personally I recommend mycelium.
About hive I don't know.

Seems you did not read or understand my simple post. Also in the single-sig wallet of my example the order of the 7 subphrases must of course be correct, otherwise the passphrase is not matching.

If the sidchains splits wiht the chain (seems like the cleaner solution), all the parties that maintain the sidechain hafe to support it.
Maybe most likely is a kind of "phase-out" strategy: The sidechain maintainer (e.g. rootstock) announces to continue on fork A long-term, and on fork-B only until 31.12.2018, for example. This leaves everybody some time to peg out in fork B without losing funds and keeps the load on layer 1 on fork B under control. ...

I see. you think of metrics in the real world (technology-wise) rather than Bitcoin internal metrics. I agree.
But I think it is not true to say such discussions have not been made. In fact, the old proposal of Pieter Wuille (+17.7% p.a.) was based on exactly this approach. He looked at technological development w.r.t. CPU power (validation speed), bandwidth, storage, and extrapolated a 17.7% p.a. growth, and suggested to hard-code this in a HF version of Bitcoin.
Other proposals (e.g. miner voting based proposals) are more residing inside the protocol itself and can hence be gamed.
The problem also with Pieter Wuilles proposal is that this 17.7% estimate is just that - an estimate, and can be too low or too high (long-term).
So what we need is a social agreement (or social contract) in the Bitcoin community to agree to scale along these lines of technological evolution. For this a HF should be introduced that has a limited "runtime"(like +17.7% p.a. for now for the next 4 years or so), with the agreement to check and adapt the growth rate for the time to come based on findings on technology in 4 years from now. Such HFs would then be non-contentious because socially agreed.
I would be the first to support such movements - you'd have an ally in me.

Quick short tutorial: Here's how TX fees basically work:
The spammer pays x BTC per kB.
No matter with how many such transactions the spammer fills the mem pool, if the honest user pays y BTC per kB, with y&gt;x, his transactions will go through. If all honest users pay "y" (&gt;x), all honest user will get their TXs through, and the spam will only fill what's left to fill the 1 MB blocks. So these honest users are not locked out, they "just" pay higher fees. Bad enough, but still: "just".
Of course, honest users using obsolete wallets with non-adaptive TX fees will probably be locked out, and that's bad for them and bad for Bitcoin's reputation, because it is unlikely that all big wallets will update to adaptive fees in a few days and the users will update their wallet SW, too.
That's all quite simple.
Critizising usage of the word "just" by ignoring the context in which it is used, that's ridiculous, troll.

Contrary to Hive, Mycelium, Bither and Coinomi all use standardized BIP32/BIP39 backup (you write down a list of 12 words on paper, plus an optional self-chosen password - that's your backup!). The good thing is they understand each others' backups and you do not depend on one wallet app. If one app makes trouble, you use the other.

Who is the "authority"? Gavin or Luke-jr?
Hmm,... let the people decide...(?)
@_date: 2019-02-10 11:45:54
1.) With 97 USD per TX and 5 tx/sec you arrive at 42 Million USD of mining fees per day. That is not unrealistic 100 years from now, as most transactions will then happen on 2nd and 3rd layers and TX fee on 1st layer can easily be worth 100 USD of today's purchasing power.
2.) Moreover, states will have accepted Bitcoin as a currency and payment mechanism by then, and will hence have established an own internationally agreed-upon checkpoint system (whether Bitcoin maximalists like it or not). The mechanisms and gremium of determining checkpoints and publishing it, and how long the checkpoint lies in the past (6 blocks? 2 hours? 3 days?), will be a matter of international treaties on UN level.
So the states will not accept big reorgs. Neither will central and private banks or private enterprises. So coins on an uncheckpointed "attack branch" will have no practical economic value.
So, e.g. if you make a Bitcoin payment to a state institution or bank and then Bitcoin reorgs by 3 days due to a massive 51% attack and you can make a double-spend, then states will have agreed upon a checkpoint deeming the now-illegally-longest-chain invalid! They simply won't accept payments on this longest branch, they simply won't consider this branch as "Bitcoin" despite it being (currently/temporarily) the longest chain! Instead they will still consider the checkpointed branch the valid chain. As a result, the illegally-longest chain will have no economical value, because no state, no bank, no business, no private individual will accept it as Bitcoin. As a result, after such a 51% attack has occurred, economically rational miners will continue working on the longest *accepted* (i.e. checkpointed) chain, not on the "totally longest illegal" chain. As a result, the attackers' efforts will turn out futile and they will stop mining on their longest but worthless chain. As a result, the "officially checkpointed" and "de-facto accepted valid chain" will grow and will soon overtake the attacker's worthless chain again. As a result, the "longest chain rule" will persist long-term!!! So the checkpointing system by the international community of states, UN, World Bank and IMF will only temporarily "overrule" the longest chain rule in the presence of an obvious 51% attack. So under these circumstances even Bitcoin maximalists that are against such checkpointing mechanisms have no choice but to accept it, because the longest chain will always turn out to be identical to the checkpointed chain, except in short temporary time periods of 51% attacks.
So even if TX fees are too low to secure the network on their own against 51% attacks, the international checkpointing mechanism will avoid 51% attacks to succeed and will ensure, long-term, that the "longest" chain remains to be the "honest" chain.
That's how it will be if Bitcoin is still around 100 years from now. Or something similar like this. Maybe it will not be the states and banks but private industry consortia that maintain this checkpointing, but you get the idea. 
@_date: 2015-08-12 00:19:36
you do need to monitor the big chain. otherwise you cannot know if some of your pre-fork coins have been spent on bigchain in the meantime. if yes, they can be spent on smallchain now without the risk of having an effect on bigchain, because the signed smallchain tx would be invalid on bigchain.

He is a very incompetent sw engineer, and I don't understand why he still has a say in Bitcoin. Actually, nobody should take him seriously! His only "merit" is that he was one of the first being involved in Bitcoin. But he failed to grow expertise as the project evolved, and now he is a nobody who is trying to team up with other nobodies, because they are combined in their inability to grasp the growing complexity of Bitcoin, they are dinasaurs and will get extinct, I am afraid.

Gavin deserves lots of credit. But note Satoshi disappeared the moment Gavin announced his meeting with CIA. Everybody knows that was a very clear diplomatic sign of his disapproval.
Moreover, Gavin's falling for CW's scam was ~~almost~~ inexcusable. Gavin should know the fundamentals of asymmetric key cryprography. As such he should have emailed this content to CW:
*Hello CW, to remove all doubt of you being Satoshi, tell me which are my favourite toon characters. Hint: &lt;start encrytped message&gt;Micky Mouse, Bugs Bunny, Asterix, luky Luke&lt;end of encryption&gt;.*
Where he'd used the pub key of satoshi for the encrypted part.
Had CW answered to him with the correct 4 names incl. capitalization and spelling mistakes, Gavin would have known CW really owns the keys. CW would at the same time have been sure to disclose it to Gavin alone and not to the world.
But Gavin was either unwilling or incapable of doing it this way, the right way. An unexcusable failure.
So he deserves to be dismissed. Nothing is forever, if you fail the high standards, you must be replaced.

Because there is a group and a movement in the bitcoin space (even having its own altcoin with 'bitcoin" in its name) that does exactly this: Denying technical reality, thinking short term and sacrificing decentralization, socially manipulating its sheep followers with pseudo-science, lacking capable developers.
So in other words, this group tries to solve a technical problem (=bitcoin scaling while keeping it decentralized) by denying the technical implications of L1-focussed upscaling and instead trying to solve it by social means (propaganda, lies, censoring Madbitcoin video on youtube by mass-flagging it...).

BSV is another crypto coin, just like bitcoin cash, litecoin, or many others.
Currently, 1 BSV is worth ca. 67.70 USD.
You cannot exchange your BSVs into USD or other cryptos on Coinbase, because Coinbase is not supporting trading of this BSV crypto currency.
However, you can transfer your BSV to another BSV address, e.g.

The halving does not cut supply in half. It does reduce the supply, though, and it does produce price up-pressure as a result.
About supply:
The supply A of bitcoin is a sum of two contributions:
A = B + C,
where B is the supply from bitcoins already present (e.g. people selling bitcoins they hodled for the last 5 years) and C is the supply due to miners selling newly mined coins to be able to pay their bills in fiat currencies.
The halvening cuts C is half:
A = B + C/2.
But this does not cut A in half. How much it reduces A is depending on the ratio B:C.
For example, if B=C, then a halvening of 'C' implies a reduction of the overall Bitcoin supply 'A' by 25%.

This is a classical fallacy. Because bitcoin has risen so much already, you think it can't rise up any more.
Fundamentals don't support your view.
Institutional money is just slowly starting to discover bitcoin, the vast majority of private people are not invested at all, an ETF does not even exit yet, many private and professionals don't understand bitcoin and still think it's a ponzi. This all are not indicators for saying "growth is over".
Don't compare bitcoin with stocks. Stocks are usually on your radar, starting with an IPO. Some stocks see astronomical growth after the IPO. But acc. to your logic, for any stock on the stock exchanges (i.e. post IPO) the time of growth is over, because the main growth has already happened, namely the growth between foundation of the company (2 people typically) and the moment of the IPO.
In bitcoin you could witness the developments that correspond to the pre-ipo developments of a company, that you usually do not see.
you never saw price tickers for microsoft or facebook pre-ipo. but their rise would've been no less impressive than bitcoin's past price evolution.

I agree with all you said. But even you said you are not against bigger blocks, so I see no contradiction! You confuse the reader!
First you say "I am against bigger blocks", and then you say "I think some research can be made towards some increase in future (but only after analyzing the impact of segwit block size increase) but the block size MUST be limited for Bitcoin to work long term".
The second quote is pretty much the opposite of "being against bigger blocks altogether".
How can we have a discussion if even this simple wording is not clear, and everybody understands something different under the slogans of being "against bigger blocks" or "being not against bigger blocks".
If I make a list of sentiments like:
* (a) I am against bigger blocks, forever
* (b) I am against bigger blocks, for the moment
* (c) I not fundamentally against bigger blocks in general
* (d) I am for bigger blocks, at some point, if done moderately
* (e) I am for bigger blocks now
* (f) I am for blocks without size limit
Then I see your position somewhere between (b) and (d), but definitely not (a).
But with your disagreement you first pretended to be on (a), and this provokes hate even by those being on (b) to (d) (actually on the same mindset as you).
The problem is, as usual, the fundamentalists.
The fundamentalists on (e) and (f) say that everybody who is not on (e) or (f) must be on (a) and hence has to be fighted.
The fundamentalists on (a) say that everybody who is not on (a) must be on (e) or (f) and hence has to be fighted.
We need to realize that the majority is between (b) and (d).

I agree (and also said so), but I also mentioned that each HF is a risk, and that the risk/reward ratio speaks against just a 2 MB HF, given the fact (or "very likely probability") that blocks will be full again in "no time". I think analysis and knowledge of the bitcoin eco-system (who is using Bitcoin and for what purpose) justifies this expectation.


Thee are fundamentally different layers of centralization we are talking about.
I am speaking of the base layer centralization. If this is centralized and under foreign control, we lost, no way to fix it.
On the other hand, if one special Layer 2 solution (e.g. a certain Lightning network, let's call it "LN One", is under government control (ignoring for a while how difficult this should be technically), the base layer is still unaffected and "free", and so there can be cypherpunk movements to implement another, competing L2 solution (call it "LN Two") that competes withthe centralized version of "LN One"..
So a centralization on L2 can be worked around and can be fixed, simply by replacement, by offering alternative L2 solutions. On the other hand, if the Layer 1 is centralized, all you can do is move to another cryptocurrency altogether. That's why I like BTC and BCH to be there. Thought Experiment: Let people expreriment with BCH. Let BCH grow. But if Layer 1 in BCH gets centralized, the only thing people will be able to do is to change the main blockchain, and they will be glad to find it in BTC.


I see it the same, and if you read my post (I know you did) you'll see that I think along the same lines. And I think the current strategy to focus on L1 efficiency improvements and L2 eco system evolution is the right way. If the only point we argue about is whether at this point of Nov 2017 a base blocksize of 1MB, 2 MB or maybe 3 MB is the best compromise, and we agree with all the rest, then our differences are very very tiny.


My conclustion is VERY different. And if youread the other post here, you see that the majority sentiment is "I was not against segwit 2x because of the 2x part, but because of the way it was concluded in closed door meeting and without preparation, and I am actually for 2 MB."
This gives hope. The rest is now up to the community. We can kep up pressure to bcore to come up with a L1 scaling roadmap e.g. based on technological evolution, make polls of all kinds (also sybil free polls) as before on the SegWit2x matter.
I am sure, the same was way all polls have shown vast agreement in rejection of the 2x part of segwit 2x, the same way the polls will be in favour of base-blocksize upscaling and against a "1MB forever" strategy. In such a pol, of course the question has to be phrased appropriately.
We could create a movement in the bitcoin community with the motto "scale up base blocksize with technical evolution oinstead of 1MB forever", and it should be made clear that this movement is not an anti-core movement per se.
 


Everybody can have this opinion. I am completely emotionless w.r.t. this. But I want choices. I don't care about names. I want to avoid having TWO "bicoin cash" versions and both failing due to centralization on layer 1. For the overall bitcoin idea, it is good to have DIVERSITY in that bitcoin and bitcoin cash follow different paths, and I sincerely wish the best for both projects. In the end, only time can tell what was the winning strategy (also for humanity), so I strongly advocate, as always, not to put all eggs in one basket - in this case not related to an investment decision (this as well, but off-topic here) but related to the strategy of Bitcoin community of having TWO bitcoins following two branches, such that at least one version will succeed. If bitcoin follows bcash, the chance is much higher that both fail for the same reason (and same if bcash followed bitcoin core).


Markets today are short term. long term, the future can be read in the starts.


I agree and wrote in this sense.


Let's challenge them with above movement and and polls etc. But let's make sure that the movement is not hijacked by BU or drastic upscaling desires. This is the danger, and then people will say: Instead of upscaling massively, it is safer to not upscale at all.

Yes, it is a wide opinion, also with me. It is the rBtc shills that try to make you believe that rBitcoin wants "1 MB forever" and nonsense like that - and they propagte Paypal 2.0 instead (although not calling it that of course). Those shills just want to split the community by spreading these lies.
In reality, this community here wants, in vast majority, to scale Bitcoin in a reasonable responsible way, acknowledging and not neglecting the unpleasant realities (faster Bitcoin adoption than "planned" being one such reality causing growing pains) and strive to find a best solution. Such solution means that decentralization is paramount, and then MULTIPLE solutions are ofered to scale bitcoin. Layer 1 blocksize increase is definitely one such means, but not the only one (as is majority-wise propagated in BCH community, for example). Other means are smart protocol improvements to improve efficiency of the Bitcoin protocol, like schnorr, Mast, as well as provisions to scale on L2 like LN and sidechains. A combination of all these solutions is what can offer solutions to the scaling problem. These methods are scientific and some don't understand them. Scaling up blocksize is what everybody understands. So many are for the "simpler" solution also for that reason, but they miss the non-negligible loss of decentralization that this involves, if made as the only solution. Moreover, they are missing that many use-case like M2M payments or micro payments cannot be realized at all with scaling on L1 alone, they are just too narrow minded.

* raise of block size limit

About 2.:
If a "longer chain" appeared today that rolls back and rewrites the last **5 days** of Bitcoin history, then I think the folloing will happen:
* Many popular people in the space send tweets asking miners to "blacklist" or "ignore" the evil chain and configure the miners to not mine on top of it.
  * Amongst them: CEOs of all crypto-exchanges world-wide.
* Andreas A. makes a YT video demanding "Do not mine on top of attacker's chain" and explaining "If the whole community agrees, attacker will give up, and soon the honest chain will be the longest chain again. Then attacker just wasted money and achieved nothing, except bringing the Bitcoin community even closer together."
* Dr. Julian Hosp will explain in his video that the "longest chain rule" is agreed upon by social consent. The rule was not made to rule over people. People have always the last word over algorithm, they are free to reject an obvious attacker's chain.
* A minority of die-hard programmers, lets call a representative of them "Luky Luke", demands: "The Bitcoin protocol rules by any means, math is clear, it is not allowed to break consensus rules. Minerst MUST mine on the longest chain! Always! And if this means Bitcoin dies, so be it! Amen!
I think the same will happen if the attacking chain rolls back the legit Bitcoin blockchain by 2 days, 1 day, or 12 hours.
The interesting question is: What if the attacker rolls back tbe blockchain by only
* 3 hours?
* 11 blocks?
* 7 blocks?
* 6 blocks?
* 5 blocks?
* 3 blocks?
* 2 blocks?
Where is the point at which the community will disagree and disintegrate?
The most dangerous attack is the one that splits the community's reaction and unity, i.e. a rollback of a small number of blocks!
And what can be the community's preparation against such an evil attack?

Coinwallet says:


From what I understood, Mycelium has adaptive fees that will exactly prevent their users' transactions to be stuck, by taking into account the current mem pool's status!
So Coinwallet is either malinformed or is spreading false info to pull users away from other wallets towards their solution. I assume they will achieve the opposite.


I think this will be harmful to Coinwallet's reputation. At least I will avoid them now that I see their destructive behaviour.

You are surprised? Really?
Honestly, when (and from where) did you aquire your knowledge about how the fiat money system works?
I for my part started learning about it auto-didactically in 2008 because I *wanted to understand* the crisis and nobody (not even my brother, a banker who earns twice as much as me with my already over-average engineer's salary) could explain to me. So I made plenty of internet research, cross checked and even found some excellent explanations at the german/european central bank's homepage (which apparently no economist reads while at university), which certainly cannot be suspected for spreading anti-central-bank conspiracies.
Today I understand.
Are you really surprised that the vast majority of people does NOT take this effort and prefer to spend their leisure time with their families or beloved (I am single) or watching soaps and playing video games or reading love nouvelles and sci-fi books?
I am not surprised at all, and I am aware (and have experienced plenty of times) that people look at me like I am a conspiracy theorist when explaining how the fiat money system works, essentially by just saying what is publically explained at the central bank's homepage.


Not only THAT money (=that 100,000 EUR) is lent out to someone else, but up to 100 times that money (i.e. 10,000,000 EUR) can be lent out (and thereby new M1 debt money is created out of thin air by a simple book keeping entry) if you bring 100,000 EUR to your private bank. That's the essence of what is called fractional reserve banking, and the ECB reduced the fractional reserve rate from 2% to 1% on 18.01.2012 (compared with FED's 10% for the USD).
Amazingly, even my brother, a well-paid banker earning more than twice of an over-average engineer's salary, admitted he could not explain to me what "fractional reserve" means, but at the same time he vigorously denied that private banks create money out of thin air and ridiculed me for claiming this. He insisted that if I bring 100,000 EUR of cash to the bank, the bank can lend out only THIS 100,000 EUR as credit, and not more, and denied that they can lend out more, again, remember, altough admitting (!) he had no clue what fractional reserve means!
My father happened to listen to our conversation and fully believed my brother and was kind of irritated about what conspiracy-type of nonsense I was telling.
That's the point when **nothing surprises you any more** and you know what Einstein meant in his famous quote about the infiniteness of universe and human stupidness.
I explained to my father and my brother that they can read up all I said at the central bank's homepage (not to mention the many tutorials and statements from respected finance experts) and that the fact that my brother doesn't know it is nothing that he can be blamed for but that he was just never taught about it at university during his studies of economics (he even majored in banking, btw.). But my father and brother agreed that what I have told just cannot be, that I must have misunderstood something, and that, afterall, I as an engineer cannot understand better how money works than someone who has studied economics for 5 years, and after all, also common sense tells that what I tried to explain is just obvious nonesense.
My argument, that I made repetitively, that my brother should first explain what "fractional reserve" is and should then explain to me why I was wrong, was just wiped away as irrelevant in the discussion! I ended up as a little boy lonely standing in the rain and understood by nobody.
**--&gt; No, I am not surprised at all.**

one correction for this otherwise great post:


The HF couldn't have occurred, because due to the "off-by-one" bug that would have avoided mining any further block, so s2x would never have activated.
However, there were more bugs in the code, so had this one bug been fixed, maybe more bugs would've caused big problems later-on.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:02:25
Roger finally committing reputational sucide.
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:01:46
I thought so (*"ulterior motives behind the procrastination"*) too, for a while (about 18-24 months ago). But now I think otherwise (also because the "arguments" at r/btc did not convince me at all and I saw even less convincing counter-proposals on the big-blocker side).
I think doing 2 MB now does not change a lot, blocks will be full again in a very short time (I am very convinced about this, as eco-systems are mature enough today to fill the added extra 1 MB very swiftly), and we have gained nothing then really (except that miners have extra income on same price level per TX as before but with double the number of TX). Then we will hear the calls for 4 MB, then 8 MB, etc. So where is the limit where decentralization starts getting endangered? Maybe not at 2 MB, I agree. But maybe at 4 or 8 MB already, maybe at 32 MB. For sure at 128 MB ...
So by increasing the base blocksize to 2 MB now we can only gains a little bit of time. such step would come with the dangers hat each HF has, and the risk/reward ratio is hence not worthwhile now.
So the better strategy is to scale on other layers first (L2, sidechains [little understood as I repetitively see, and often confused with altcoins]) as well as Mast/Schnorr protocol improvements for better efficiencies (more TX per MByte). 
At a bigger time scale (when looking at the eco-system in a more complete holistic way), we must realize that the times of "free/cheap lunch" is over forever, the times of cheap Bitcoin TX will never come back. This is the price of adoption. So the eco-system HAS TO, sooner or later, adapt to this new reality (which many, esp. at rBtc, reject to accept). This adaptation means to move services to L2 solutions like LN or sidchains first of all. The sooner this happens, the sooner eco-system (companies, wallets, tools, ...) adapts, the more load is taken away from the Bitcoin blockchain early-on, and the longer gets the lever(!) later-on when we upscale the base blocksize at a later point in time (at that point, probably such HF is well prepared and also bundled with other HF-relevant protocol improvements at that opportunity).
This ("larger lever") is a largey neglected effect!
If we scale up base blocksize *now*, in today's eco-system, we can serve a certain number of more users by scaling up from 1 MB to 2 MB.
But if we scale up from 1 MB to 2 MB at a later point in time when L2 solutions (like LN channels, and pegged sidechains) are already established, this same base blocksize upgrade will cause a MUCH MUCH higher increase of extra users allowed to participate.
So also from this perspective it is good to provide incentive for the eco-system to take efforts to use the blockchain efficiently.
Of course, many voices say: But if we do not scale up now, then other blockchains (like Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash or Ethereum) will steal market share from Bitcoin in the ecosystem (mainly for that parts of the eco-system that do not want to scale on L2). Here we can only say: Yes, so be it. But there is no way we can avoid it. The only alternative to avoid this is to scale up bitcoin base blocksize practically limitless, to 2 MB, then 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. MB. But then we lose Bitcoin's decentralization characteristics. We have maintained the name "Bitcoin" then but lost it's soul.
So the answer is: Let those companies move to Bitoin Cash and others if they want to - it's their own responsibility to choose between decentralized expensive Bitcoin and centralized ("paypal 2.0") less expensive solutions. We will have both models competing with each other in the end.
Final note on personal investment aspect: I am hodling BTC and BCH and have no plans to change my stakes in one part or the other. I am convinced that both will exist and both will find their niches (and I know that I have enemies from both extremist ideological sides with this position), and I think it is good that both follow by their own principles.

Hmmm..., so $9.38 per mBTC is madness?
Just one question: In the 2nd half of 2012, was it madness when BTC moved from 5 to 6 to 7 to 8 to 9 and then even to $10 and then even $13 (and continued to grow in 2013)? Where exactly was the madness? At $8? At $9? And why at exactly that point?
I am not trying to pump. But it seems to be a fact that there is enormous inflow and growth of private customer base as well as institutional money. It might well be that the current rise is more solid and stable and based on fundamentals than the one I just quoted from 2012. Might be. Just a thought.

The bottom left figure with the angles makes no sense!! Because it depends on the aspect ratio! With another aspect ratio, you get different factors where you now get the same factor.
Try instead to express the steepness of the lines in percent, not in degrees. This way you should become independent of the aspect ratio (ALL steepnesses change by the SAME factor when changing the aspect ratio)

Yes, and it is unpredictable to tell when the (temporary) crash happens. At 9250, or at 10123, or at 16975, or at 80322, or at 102863. So selling at any point is most likely the wrong decision - it is more likely that it will not be tipping point before the crash, then that it will. So hodling is the safer, less risky, strategy.
In retrospect, all my trading was counter-productive. Had I not traded anything at all in my personal history, I would own (much) more bitcoins than what I actually own today.

I have the feeling that such a move would be the coffin nail on the unique position of bitcoin-core.
it would mean that in future there are two mutually hostile camps of respected devs, fighting for the majority of miners and other stakeholders.
miners would vote for black or white (1MB fixed or 8MB+40% p.a.) and there wouldn't be an intermediate way, no way miners could vote for "grey".
@_date: 2015-08-04 23:25:10
It's really quite obvious:
If a *private person* uses bitcoins to pay the private piano lesson, it's difficult for the state to prevent this or to even find out.
However, if a *business* is openly and officially advertising that they accept bitcoins, not only the customers but also the authorities will take notice. And if this was forbidden, the state would have all reason to readily close down the business, if they didn't stop immediately.
And that's reality, at least where I am living, in the centre of Europe: Every day businesses and/or web sites pay penalties or are closed down because of violation of some rules (unless you are living in an anarchistic country). E.g., restaurants failing hygiene standards, web sites with bad imprint, shops selling weed or guns, pubs opening for too long, sites offering illegal media protected by DRM, etc. If Bitcoin was proclaimed to be illegal by law, no business could afford to still advertise something that is expressively against the law.
Normally this goes without saying, I am surprised that people deny this triviality.
If you still don't believe, think about why in China no business openly accepts Bitcoin as payment, and why Baidu stopped accepting Bitcoin back in 2013/2014 after it was declared illegal. MAYBE it has to do with the fact that it was declared illegal for businesses to accept bitcoin for payments, and MAYBE the businesses would behave differently (i.e. would accept bitcoins) without that ban.

Thanks for pointing this out.
The human mind is not good at all in thinking in terms of **probabilities and statistics**, it is much better in thinking in terms of **absolute numbers**. This has been investigated and proven in many psychological experiments repetitively. If the human mind has a choice, it prefers thinking of total numbers rather than propabilities and statistics, and this tendency is VERY strong even amongst statistics professors. Thinking in absolute quantities comes easy to the human brain, whereas thinking in statistical ratios takes effort. Economy-Nobel-Price winner Daniel Kahneman explains this very clearly in his book "Thinking, Fast And Slow", that I warmly recommend.
That's why almost all people tend to think, if they hear "I am one in a Million" for Bitcoin: "Well , so there are [only] one million people (total count!) on earth that share a certain property, and I am one of them." If they interpret it this way, they think of an **absolute number** (= 1 Million people) and hence arrive at 21 BTC, because no more than 1 Million people can possess 21 BTC or more due to the total supply limit of 21 Mill BTC. That's easy, appears evident and comes easy to the mind.
A small minority of people takes a little extra brain effort and interprets the statement "I am one in a Million" as a **statistical** statement (which doesn't come easy to the mind): Amongst a random pick of 1 Million people, there is statistically only one who satisfies a condition of rareness, like owning 3000 bitcoins. So this is a property of statistical **rareness**. If I own 3000 BTC, I satisfy this condition of rareness, I am rare, I am (statistically!) one in a million, i.e. the other 999,999 people don't satisfy this **condition of rareness**. That's because "1 in a Million" is statistically the same as "7000 in 7 Billion (= world population)", and 7000x3000 BTC = 21 Million BTC.
It is the same like what is meant if a singer of a boy group sings about a girl:
*"You are one in a Million!"*
It means:
*"Amongst as many as 1 Million random girls, there's only one like you. If I loose you, I have to check 1 Million other girls (statistically) before I meet another girl like you."*
Since there are 3.5 Billion "girls" (=females) on earth (ignoring the age), it would be equivalent to saying: "Girl, there are only 3500 girls like you on the entire planet, you are one **of** them, you are one of those 3500, you are one of 3500, you are one **in** a Million, you are so rare!"
Now, semantically, saying "You are one in a Million girls" is equivalent to saying "you are one in a Million Bitcoin owners". So, if the first is an expression of rareness in the sense of "only one amongst any random 1 Million girls is like you , the others are different", then the second one must be the same: "only one amongs any random 1 Million Bitcoin owners is like you, the others are different (=own less bitcoins)."
So this definitely means: "You own 3000 BTC (and not 21 BTC)."
*To summarize:*
The argument here is what this "1 Million" means:
In the first interpretation, it means: "There are only 1 Million people **in total** that own this many bitcoins, and you are **one of them**, you share the same property as those 1 Million people." The *lower* the number [1 Million], the more exclusive you are.
In the second interpretation, it means: "**Statistically**, only one in 1 Million people share the same property as you in terms of bitcoin ownership, you are **different to the others** in this statistical group of 1 Million." The *higher* the number [1 Million], the more exclusive you are.
So, to be clear, one should either say:
"You are one of a Million people (in total) sharing the same property." 
"You are one in a Million people (statistically) being different from the others."

- Certain theoretical future cryptographic attack vectors like quantum computers are said to be possibly capable of deriving the private key from the public key, but not from the hash of the public key (from the address). So the sha256 provides considerable extra security.

You are just such an ignorant narrow-minded small blocker as there are ignorant "Layer1 only scaling" big blocker ideologists elsewhere. You cannot even do simple maths. **You are representing a minority here on rBitcoin with your "1MB forever" advocacy.**
Just make a simple math, man! If Bitcoin reaches World adoption, current Layer 1 capacity is just good enough to allow one opening and one closing of a Lightning Channel **per person pre lifetime.** Very simple math.
If you have not ever done that math, you should quickly do it to avoid being laughed at.
If you have done this math and still say "1 MB forever", you imply that Bitcoin will never reach mainstream adoption.
Fact is that technology evolves, and mid/long-term it is well possible to increase Layer 1 capacity moderately in a way that does not harm decentralization.
It is the fundamentalists like you "1 MB forever" or like the "layer 1 scaling only" big blockers that divide the community.
We need more pragmatists.

Indeed, there are plenty of good arguments that 1 MB is not enough (e.g. an average of one tx per 100 years for world population is not sustainable).
I agree with OP that the spam transactions (if you want to call it like that) is not one of them.
Conclusion: We definitely need block size increase, but not because of the "spam transactions".
If somebody used the "spam transactions" as a strawman argument *against* the blocksize increase by suggesting someone wants to coerce block size increase by this (not suggesting that OP is doing that) - well, that'd be a very bad and artificial argument for keeping 1MB blocks.

There is a greek exchange called btcgreece.com, as I learned.
Amazingly, bitcoins trade only at ca. 2 EUR premium there compared to German/European exchange bitcoin.de. I would have expected a higher premium.
Since that exchange is in Greece, it means that participants transfer Euros from one greek bank account to another greek bank account, so this should not be affected by capital controls, it should work as usual.
I.e., buying bitcoins in Greece should be possible, as far as I understand.

I have the impression you ignore the technical and incentive side and are focussed on user perspective only.
In a centralized system like banks/credit cards, it is possible to cross-subsidize payments of different amounts/volumes. That's what we are used today in daily payment life, but it doesn't reflect the real costs (a 1 EUR tranfer cost the same as a 100000 EUR transfer - the same number of electrons are flowing, but the pricing model doesn't reflect this).
But Bitcoin has to reflect the true network cost, because it is purely incentive-based, cross-subsidisation of small transactions by large ones is not a sustainable or even workable model for decentralized Bitcoin. Sorry, but for this aspect users (or the user-side protocols) have to adapt. However, intelligent wallet solutions and payment protocol enhancement can make this transparent to the customer (for example the receiver [shop] could pay the tx fees up to a certain amount and price this in, and this could be incorporated in the payment protocol, so user won't see the fee), so creativity must happen at the application side but the core protocol must, and will, keep it's incentive-based pricing model, i.e. pay tx fee per kByte.

little difference:
* it was the original idea of Bitcoin/Nakamoto to have **no** block size limit, --&gt; i.e. the current discussion is about how to get back and implement Bitcoin as it was designed from the start.
* it was the original idea, and a core trait of Bitcoin, to have a cap limit of 21 Mill. This was always in the SW like this --&gt; no need to do any change - discussion on this completely superflous
If Matonis really questioned the cap limit and was not misinterpreted, he is the dumbest person in the bitcoin world and lost all respect, and should be ignored.

This is interesting, and I think it is important that the community controls the miners. In this case, I have a few points to make...:


This suggests that these are antpools "own" transactions. Maybe these are dust collection transactions that have many small inputs and one (or few) output(s). Can you confirm this? Also it is possible that these are dust collection transaction antpool is doing as a service for someone else, but more likely for themselves.


Yes, this further confirms this hypothesis.


There is another possibility: If this block (let's refer to it as block N) was mined shortly after block N-1 (which happens regularly due to statistics), the miner (here antpool) had no time to fully check and validate all transactions of block N-1. While the miner's CPU is doing this validation job (which takes a few seconds), the miner cannot include any transactions from the global mem pool when mining (i.e. trying hashes) for block N, because otherwise it may include transactions already included in block N-1. So usually, during the first few seconds after a new block (N-1) any rational miner will mine for an empty block, and only after completely confirming block N-1, it can  build up new transactions into block N and mine for a full and valid block N.
Now, to think along these lines a bit further, we can see: Instead of mining a completely empty block during said few seconds, the miner could instead include some transactions already during this phase, if he is sure that these transactions are not already included in block N-1. Naturally, he can only be sure about this for its very own transactions. So he says: Well, if I mine an empty block anyway, I can just as well mine for my own dust collection transaction - because I get this dust collection for free if I find a new block during these first few seconds after block N-1.
This is the probable and most reasonable and rational explanation that I could think of.


This actually is impossible to be a systematic phenomenon. Mining a block cannot determine when the next block gets mined. This is pure randomness, always, acc. to a stochastic poisson process. So if this observation of you is true, it can only be be pure coincidence for plain mathematical reasons.
Note the question we/you have to ask ourselves/yourself in this context: Are we talking about actual times at which the block was mined, i.e. in UTC world time? Or(!) are we talking about the UTC time*stamps* contained in the blocks? Unfortunately, Bitcoin allows a very generous 2 hours (not sure if +/-1h or +/-2h) tolerance for the time stamps, so wrong timestamps may lead to wrong interpretations when analysing the blockchain offline in retrospect.


See above. Antpool cannot systematically forbid the rest of the world to mine for 1 hour, so the explanation is either coincidence or a time stamp bias.


As said, other explanations seem reasonable, and lagging the network in terms of not letting others mine for some time is technically impossible.


That is impossible. Difficulty only rises if the hashrate rises beforehand. This is how the difficulty adjustment part of the Bitcoin protocol is designed. Difficulty rise without hash rate rise is impossible by definition of the Bitcoin protocol.


This was my contribution.


It would be interesting to know if the block times of blockchain.info are the timestamps inluded in the blocks, or the UTC times when blockchain.info Bitcoin nodes have seen the respective block for the first time. Statistics of such deviations would be highly useful and conclusive, and I encourage everyone to inlude such a feature in his/her private Bitcoin node.
But as said, protocol-wise it is impossible that some ~9kB blocks are the reason for lags (i.e. longer times of no blocks) afterwards.
Anyway, I also enchourage everyone for deeper analysis.

I followed the advice of this article to think by myself and to not believe blindly any Bitcoin authority, not even the author of this article himself.
So here are the ***two main flaws in this article***, which, if corrected, yield an ***entirely different conclusion***:
1. The article always speaks of "one hour". But Bitcoin receivers can define themselves when they consider a tx as "final". The "6 confirmations" (= avg. 1h) is not set in stone. They may decide 1 day (144 blocks) is needed, for example. Then the whole argument about the "one hour" falls apart. And after 100 blocks or so it is safe to identify something fishy is going on via analysis of the public blockchain , and to do counter measures (see 2.)
2. The community of honest bitcoin participants (incl. exchanges, nodes and miners) can agree that the blockhashs of the (obviously!) attacking blocks are invalid. The honest miners just continue to mine on the *longest honest* chain, BUT (!) ignoring those "invalid" (because fraudulent) blocks. This means they temporarily discard the "most pow chain" rule by this ***mechanism of social control***. After a while the chinese gov'mt would see their attack was unsuccessfull because the rest of the world is just ignoring their dishonest chain, albeit it being longer (containing more pow). As a result, they'll stop mining this useless chain eventually (maybe after 1 day, maybe after 1 month ... [edit: no, actually much earlier because we're talking about a POOL attack and miners will leave the fraudulent mining pool quickly]). Short time later, the honest chain will be the longest chain again. So no fork is needed with a change of consensus rules (like ETH vs. ETC as quoted in the article), ***just a temporary(!) moratorium (modification) in the "longest chain" rule is needed*** when the community identifies an attack chain. This can be realized by a simple bitcoin miner/node software patch that any core developer can release to the world within minutes, if needed.     
     
After this attack has been unsuccessful, miners will avoid chinese pool operators forever and chinese gov'mt won't have a 2nd chance for this attack (and if they had, they'd fail again). Then, once again, it will turn out that bitcoin will be safer than ever before, strenghtened by this attack.

It hurts my logic and understanding of statistics that you are downvoted so much, because you are definitely right. Strictly speaking, the correct number is 3000 BTC, not 21 BTC.
But I am sure most of the downvoters really think that they are right, and they really think you are trolling, and they cannot follow your arguments, even if they try. No offense to them though, because that is just HUMAN!
This is because the world of statistics doesn't come easy to people's mind, because it is very unintuitive and is a pain, and it is so much more intuative to think in terms of absolute numbers. That's how the human brain is constructed.
Maybe one last try to convince the respected downvoters: Look e.g. at this video of Bosson ( when he sings to his girl: *"You're one in a Million"*.
What do you think is the picture that the singer wants to convey with this text?
(a) *"Girl, you are so special, if there are 1 Million girls in front of me, you are the only one I want. The other 999,999 mean nothing to me!"* (or more precisely: *"it requires no less than 1 Million girls to find just one girl like you!"*)
(b) *"Girl, amongst the 3.5 Billion girls on earth, [as many as] 1 Million are like you. That's one girls in each group of 3500 females, on average, i.e. in each village of 7000 inhabitants (incl. babies and elderly people), 50% of which are female, I would find on average one girl like you! So you are not very special after all."*
Of course, the correct answer is (a). We understand this intuitively without effort, although statement (a) is, strictly speaking, a statistical statement, which normally doesn't come easy to people's mind. However, here it is connected with emotions, so we understand it well. The alternative (b) appears ridiculous.
Now we apply the **same semantics "one in a Million"** to a less romantic, less emotional context, namely Bitcoin ownership!
By logical rules of grammar, amongst the two interpretations, also here interpretation (a) must be the correct one:
(a) *"You are so special, if there are 1 Million random people, only one of them owns as many bitcoins as you, the rest owns less. You need to own at least 3000 bitcoins to be sure to be that exclusive."*
(b) *"Amongst all the 7 Billion people on earth, no more than 1 Million are like you. That's 1 person per each group of 7000 people on average. So you own at least 21 bitcoins"*
If you still think that, in case of Bitcoin, interpretation (b) is correct (despite voting for (a) in case of the "special girl" from the song), you see how failable the human mind is, by your own example! (again, no offense! This is in fact very human, humans are no machines but succeptible to logical errors like this!)

@_date: 2015-07-15 00:11:46


Exactly. With 7 Billion people on earth (roughly), if only 7000 own 3000+ bitcoins, that's statistically 1 in 1,000,000, i.e. you are statistically rare in the world's population with ratio 1:1,000,000. That's what I meant with "one in a Million", an expression of rareness :-)
In other words: If you picked 1,000,000 random people on earth, on average one of them is in the "3000 BTC" club.


If you own 21 bitcoin, you belong to a group of 1,000,000 people, so then you are one **out of a group of** 1,000,000. That's one 7000th of the world population, roughly.
In other words: If you picked 7000 random people on earth, on average one of them is in the "21 BTC" club. That's statistically "one in 7000", or "one out of the top 1,000,000 group".
Hope this clarifies what I wanted to say, I know that statistics is confusing to most people, and by telling plain statistical facts one runs danger of getting heavily downvoted because other people honestly think that it's nonesense, which it isn't :-)
I find this kind of amusing and do not take it personal. But anyway, please think twice (or 3 or 4 times) before concluding that I am wrong here.

The "slow" coins can still be traded on exchanges off-chain, namely as successor coins of coins already on the exchange pre-fork - even if the coin's blockchain makes currently no progress. They just canmot be withdrawn temporarily, as long as no blocks are mined.

One of the few constructive replies here. Thank you!
I could imagine another evolution also:
If Bitcoin is accepted by western governments as reserve currency, they could one day decide to impose rules of what they accept as Bitcoin in a next steps years later. E.g. they could define that a certain block hash is hostile (e.g. because of a detected 51% attack or because it contains a TX from a blacklisted "terrorist" UTXO), thereby effectively forking/redefining Bitcoin into a "Bitcoin West". They could forbid  exchanges etc. to offer services w.r.t. what they consider the "evil" chain, and would thereby enforce their Bitcoin block checkpoints (and thereby consensus rules) onto the whole jurisdiction. This way government would gain control over Bitcoin, gradually, and so re-gain control over the national currency eventually.
Clearly, they would do this gradually - "heating the water that the frog is sitting in" slowly, and it would be a process spanning over decades, because it has to align with people's psychology. It could be something like that:
1. Government accepts Bitcoin as legal currency.
2. Bitcoin more&amp;more replaces fiat in economical life.
3. One day a hostile 51% attack happens rolling back the blockchain by 1 day.
4. Government insists to ignore this attacker's blockchain via checkpointing. Industry, media and population agree and are happy that government makes clear not to give evil forces any chance. Few warning voices of too much governmental control are ignored by the large population and msm, because government did the right thing here. The warning voices are even discredited as "terrorists". All goes back to normal again after this incident.
5. After increase tertorist use, Government passes a law that forbids miners to include blacklisted terrorist UTXOs into blocks and forbids companies to operate with such chains and offer any services - whether exchanges, banks, grocery stores or online shops. Similar to step 4., government publishes lists of UTXOs or block hashes that miners must not accept.
6. Once the system is established, the blacklusting is gradually extended from terrorist scope to economical and political scope.
7. Competing governments do the same. So companies operating world-wide must abide to the blacklists from all those governments - a superset of all blacklists!
8. Needless to say that anonymous untraceable blockchains become widely forbidden.
9. People realize that this money system, which started as a free system, is maybe more fascist than classical fiat has ever been.
10. In a political conflict the chain breaks up in two, as jurisdiction 1 is no more willing to accept the blacklist of jurisdiction 2. Two World-Bitcoins are the result.
11. Since government has anyway the de-facto control over Bitcoin now, they decide to change consensus rules from pow to government-checkpointed blocks. So Bitcoin blockchain finally becomes a centrally controlled fiat coin.
12. As a natural next step, the entity controlling Bitcoin also eliminates the 21 Mill cap, thereby finalising the transition from free Bitcoin to centralized fascist CentralBankCoin 2.0.
Needless to say - I hope this scenario never materializes. But I fear it contains elements that may materialize. Maybe not exactly in this way and order, but likewise, with the intention to regain governmental control over the money eventually.
It would be comparable (to some extend) to the exit from bretton-woods on 15th August 1971, which also created a fundamentally new money system, namely today's unbacked fiat system.

Possibly the bet site is working on the same wrong chain, maybe they are even using some blockchain.info API.
Copay wallet apparently uses the right chain.
So what to to? Maybe wait some hours, eventually even the broken "blockchain.info" should be back on the correct chain.

Wait: the covert method is the one that is "hidden", right?
The other method that is still there would be the one using asicboost in plain sight, right?
Then, by definition, that second one can even more easily be eliminated by softfork. We just need to declare open asicboost blocks (non-covert) as illigal, thereby restricting the set of valid blocks. this is exactly a softfork.
@_date: 2017-04-11 00:08:01
not quite. see my elaborate thought experiment here:
@_date: 2017-04-11 22:56:12
In general, UASF is a means for the market to self-defend against 51% attacks. Without UASF, the market would self-succumb to such a miner majority attack completely unnecessarily.
If the market majotity is in favour of UASF, the miner hash rate will follow the market forces (financial self-interest of the miners, their mining income is higher on the chain higher-valued by the markets) and the UASF chain will become the longest chain, thereby successfully defending against the 51% attack.
At the moment, UASF is discussed in connection with SegWit activation, but there are other, much simpler scenarios possible.    
Example: A secret 51% attacker mines a longer chain in secret, starting from block N, and then publishes it after, say, 30 days. Under normal conditions, we'd see a gigantic chain reorg now, reverting all bitcoin transactions of the last 30 days.
Now the user community had two possibilities:
- (a) do nothing, accept the bitcoin protocol rules as is, and see Bitcoin crashing and becoming worthless.
- (b) releasing a UASF that adds the normal consensus rules by one additional rule that declares the block hash of block N (see above) of the attacking chain as invalid. This way, the 51% reorg attack is defended by the users (UASF), the attacker has mined worthless coins, and after a while the honest chain will also be the longest chain again.
Of course, in case of that latter example, the Bitcoin community my consider HF to change PoW, or add other automatic regular checkpoint mechanisms to prevent the attacker from doing it again. But for the sake of UASF explanation, that described scenario is just another kind of UASF.

In the end, what counts, what determines success in UASF is not node count (which can be sybill-atacked) but only market demand (=cash, money, ...) for the UASF-coins.
If this demand is high, then market forces will make this UASF chain succeed and become the longest chain.

use litecoin, it has almost empty blocks, almost zero fees (as a result) and is soon going to support SegWit with a whole bunch of application and further capa increase. It is also less centralized in its mining.
So use litecoin and don't complain that bitcoin doesn't scale because some are blocking SegWit for political reasons and spamming the blockchain. If enough ppl move to litecoin, hopefully bitcoin's SegWit blockers will see which harm they do to bitcoin (unless of course they see it already now and want to do harm, which I do not hope).

majority hash-power can of course attack Vertcoin in the sense of a normal 51% attack (which would be an attack technically [not politically] completely independent of UASF - just a normal 51% attack).
I don't see how "real world cash-power" could fuck over Vertcoin, because I assume that all exchanges will treat UASF like a normal HF (which happens all the time in all altcoins) in a way that it is not possible to trade the "old" Vertcoins on any exchange. So there won't even be an opportunity for a creating artificial demand imbalance in disfavour of Vertcoin-UASF.

because by design of bitcoin's incentive structure, miners' egoistic interests and bitcoin's investors' interests were identical: if price rises, it's good for both.
but the asicboost bug broke this coherence because now it's a leading greedy miner's economical interest to block bitcoin's progress and price increase (what is more, the same bug also fosters miner centralization) and hence must be fixed, such that miners' greed leads to the best for bitcoin again.

*ii) Greeks defy the government by voting "yes", or;*
*iii) The public votes "no" and Greece prepares for a default.*
*We think that there is a 10-20% chance of the first scenario, a 20-30% chance of the second that Greece votes for a deal with Europe against the government's advice, and a* **60% chance of the third scenario** *of an outright "no" vote. The consequences of either the second or third scenario would be severe.

Bitcoin is new. So people are respectful and think it's complicated, because they don't know it. Like they were respectful with computers (which was too complicated and they would never understood) and preferred using the type writer.
Money is something people use all day since child age, it's familar, so they THINK they understand money. But that's a fallacy. What they understand is the cash they hold in their hands. And they understand that the can withdraw cash from an ATM. Or make a wire transfer. But that's just the user interface. They don't understand what money really is, because they don't need to in daily life. This gets clear by a simple example: Cyprus bank bail-in! Don't get me wrong, I am not defending banks here, but people were wrong when they said "the Cyprus banks stole our money". These people don't understand that this money never existed, that the bank never HAD that money, so they could not steal it or take it away. Here it's getting complicated already. Yiu have to understand The role of central banks, the role of private banks, and the role of the real economy, to understand the money system. And I think 90-99% are not in the position to explain the basic mechanisms of all these entities correctly.
In contrast to that  Bitcoin is really simple to understand. There are not several layers of money (M0, M1),  there's only one. There's no fractional reserve banking system as a necessary layer in the system, in bitcoin. All is flat.
Other viewpoint: Imagine you have to explain an alien how the money system works, all from scratch. Explaining Bitcoin is WAY easier than explaining fiat.

@_date: 2017-04-19 17:40:15
correct. if 40% is on uasf honest miners, it would require 41% to attack uasf, leaving just 19% on OldChain. So OldChain has less work and will reorg to become identical to uasf chain.

I think csrfdez's theory is most likely. Apparently your blockchain.info wallet has displayed an unconfirmed balance and finally the money did not receive.
Here, clearly the company "blockchain.info" is to blame, and while I do not know how blockchain.info's wallet is working at present (I have not used it myself for several years, for good reason, and won't use it ever again in the future), it is well known that blockchain.info has a very bad track record of often stupid bugs, and all knowledgeable people recommend NOT to use the wallet software from blockchain.ino. They (blockchain.info) really have messed up their SW much too often already.

it's not a hf - not even "almost".
the key is that oldchain can reorg and vanish, making investment in oldchain like holdind a time bomb.
this property is only so cause it's a SOFT fork. for a hard fork this risk for oldcoin wouldn't exist. Hence uasf is a crystal clear SOFT fork and no hard fork at all. do not redefine terminology of sf and hf, please.

fallacy! security is directly given by mining cost, and only indirectly by hashrate (because it correlates with mining cost).
if everyone can mine 20% more hashrate for same cost, any attacker could as well, so security doesn't increase.
The only way bitcoin security can increase is by increasing the mining reward (in fiat) as sum of block reward + tx fees.

if some hodlers sell uasf coins and invest in oldcoins, they end up owning NOTHING after the reorg.
No sane investor would do that, not even a Roger.
A reorg in one direction would destroy oldchain, while a reorg in the other direction (destroying uasf-coin) cannot happen, technically. Hence the risk profile is extremely asymmetric.
investing in oldcoin is like holding a hot potatoe, or a time bomb.
I thought this was clear from the presentation. if not, hope it is clear now.

I  was not sure if I should waste time on this, but that response is everything but "mature".
The author (calling himself by the name "Jimmy Song") obviously does not know what he is talking about. First he misses the point by elaborating on unimportant formal aspects on slides  and  that do nothing to the principal subject matter.
**Afterwards he makes two blatant errors and bases his following arguments on these wrong assumptions, rendering his complete chain of "arguments" meaningless.**
First he makes a **breathtaking error in his comment on slide  when **he confuses exchanges with market participants (traders)**, showing that he does not even understand how an exchange works by principle:
He says that the exchange would go bankrupt when the Old-Chain re-orgs, as shown on slide 17. He thinks that the exchange would lose money! I had to smile from (t)his naivety! Might look "convincing" to the "lowbrow" reader, but it couldn't be more wrong! Dear lowbrow readers, let me explain to you:
*If the Old-Chain reorgs, then what would happen is that every owner of Old-Chain coins on that exchange would simply lose these coins - his "Old-Coin" balance would simply become zero after the re-org! And it would have been equally well become zero if he had withdrawn the Old-Coins from the exchange to his private wallet before the re-org happened.*
*So the exchange loses nothing, only the OWNERS of Old-Chain-Coins lose everything. The $10,000 that the author talks about, that I withdraw from the exchange after selling my "old-coins", were not owned by the exchange (as the author apparently thinks or wants the reader to believe), but by the trading partner who bought my Old-Chain-Coins!! So this buyer of my Old-Coins is the one who loses money, because after having purchased my Old-Coins for $10,000, he gets soon-worthless Old-Coins that evaporate after the re-org!*
*The exchange is ALWAYS winning! Because for each trade the exchange is earning commissions. e.g. at 0.5% commission it would earn $50 for the $10,000 trade in this example, and this $50 will remain with the exchange, independent of whether the Old-Chain re-orgs or not. That's the whole business model of an exchange! The exchange bears no risk whatever happens to the coins!*
A few more wrong statements by the "mature" (lol) author (I cannot list all, so I make selections):




*Whether knowingly or not, this is senseless FUD that appears(!) reasonable to the lowbrow reader, but it is pure nonsense resulting from the author's lack of understanding of replay attacks. A user using exclusively UASF-coin does not need to worry about his UASF-chain transactions being replayed on Old-Chain. This does not harm (or touch) his UASF-chain coins in any way. Since Old-Coins will anyway evaporate (slide 17), an UASF chain user can safely just ignore any replay on Old-Chain. So there is no reason AT ALL for any users to stop Bitcoin transactions on UASF-chain.*
The next argument of the author ("Crash") is a result of his failure to comprehend replay attacks.
From section "Miner Motivation" onwards he takes different assumptions than me (he assumes a hard fork - he calls it "permanent" fork - rather than a soft fork), so of course my slides do not match his path of thinking here.
I am sorry to say that Jimmy Song (name of this "mature" author) has to learn a lot before writing premature blog posts based on false facts and blatant misunderstandings and failures of thinking.
If his blog post was motivated by an attempt to manipulate lowbrow readers against his own better knowledge, he failed miserably, and we have to assume that this was a quite telling desperate attempt of the "Anti-SegWit Mafia".

if minority chain is worth more it wont be a minority for long because miners will switch to the worthier chain to increase profits.


you mean "splitting the coin", because the community is split already.
ironically, it seems that we can either have a split community with a unified single chain, or a split of the chain with an end to the community war.  (at least not as long as roger is doing his toxic populist propaganda - I came to that insight at a time when I still thought BIP100 is the way to go).

because **it would just be a normal 51% attack as it can happen to any coin (esp. if global hash rate is low) INDEPENDENT of whether there is a SF, HF, or no fork at all.**
The exchanges, for sure, will unanimously follow the uasf since there won't be any market interest whatsoever for the "old" vertcoin chain.

Hi molecc,
I am sorry, my emotions... And I know you as a old community member also from bitcointalk from the earlier days, do I do not consider you a BU-shill, so I take your criticism seriously!
I just find it ironic that this very promising Bitcoin report appeared on Rogers web site, and at the same time Roger does really EVERYTHING he can to discredit Bitcoin and block its success and progress, himself driven by personal ambivalences to people rather than rational arguments. I am so fed up with this person that I sometimes shoot above the goal, and I am sorry for that - I cannot ALWAYS control my emotions, and you'd see that I am also making quite a few quality posts here (on scientific topics like socio-economic scenarios, mathematics, statistics, tutorials, etc., and many more) and spend my time, as a hobby. At times I still have fun, there are also good thinkers and humorous people here.
The reason I am against Roger is a long story for me, personally (others may have other backgrounds). He is a huge disappointment to me, and I see how he manipulates other people!
It started out 2 years ago or so when I got interested into the scaling problem. I symphatised with BIP100, Bitcoin Classic, and, after some initial doubts and questions, even with BU. At the same time I was angry about the fact these topics couldn't be discussed on rBitcoin and I found a "new home" at rBtc.
But then, over time, I realized that rBtc was less and less able to discuss pragmatically. For eample I studied Peter R's BU presentation and his economical model, and I discovered flaws in the model therein, I thought into it deeply, made my own drawings and thoughts, and wanted to discuss this as is normal in any scienetific community. But this was not possible and I was just attacked with hostility although my intention was to understand and improve the BU concept, not to attack it. It took be some more time until I found out that the King (or Jesus if you will...) wears no clothes but is naked.
First I was fed-up with the bcore 1MB-forever-idiots" who did not understand that a full bus canot carry more passengers if you make the ticket more expensive. It took me long time to realize that I was talking to bcore idiots, not to the true experts, and that the true experts are not at all on the "1MB forever camp" but have a much deeper insight and thought analysis on the subject matter than what I thouhgt.
At that time I found out several times that not only those anonymous BU- and Anti-core-shills, but also Roger himself, made posts that where manipulative, factually wrong and dogmatic. I asked him not to do this and keep the perspective, but it became worse and worse. This happened while I was still on the anti-core camp. Over time, I realized how hypocratic all this was, that a deeper scientific discussion was not possible with anybody on the BU camp and that I was too much in contact with FALSE bitcoin core advocates that gave core a bad name.
I started to querey my point of view, became neutral, wanted to hear scientific arguments from both sides and found that it was possible (without censorship) to have excellent discussion in the forum that I left in hate - r/bitcoin. I learned a lot, and today I am fully convinced that SegWit is the right ways to go and there is no rational reason (other then Jihan's rational Asicboost interest of course) not to do segWit. There is so many FUD spread about segWit, liek the evil discount (completely misunderstood by many) to name jsut one, or the alleged big technical debt of the code...
I am not sure why Roger is blocking SegWit, but I did not see a single valid argument neither from him nor from his friends. And I really tried to approach it with an open mind so often.
Please do not believe ME!! Please do your own research with an OPEN mind in ALL directions, don't let yourself convince too quickly, think complex if issues are complex and don't accept allegedly simple solution too quickly for complex problems, then you are doing it right.

if you just OBSERVED the scene, you would know.


He is a psychpath - this is out of question and results from simple observation and educating yourself about what kind of personality disorders exist. Denying this is either malvolence or lack of knowledge about this (I strongly assume the latter in your case, because acquiring know how takes time and effort).


It shows you don't know anything on the subject matter. So let's clarify: Psychopaths are not inferior, they just have a personality disorder that makes them different from average people in some respects. And in fact, often this disorder allows them to achieve things easier, so they are in some senses superior to the average people, not inferior. Lack of emphaty combined with ego-centric character and strong skills of manipulating other people are such often shown chatacteristics of psychpaths, and Roger shows all these characteristics more than clearly, without any doubt.
Funnily, certain psychpaths also have the characteristic of being easily influecable, which is an interesting mix to their own manipulative skills towards others. Interestingly, this mixes nicely with Roger and can explain some of his behaviours. It is difficult for normal people to make sense out of all this, which is no surprise at all if you deal with personality-disordered persons (=psychpaths).


Yes, and psychopatic people are part of this battlefield.
Finally, I want to make clear that being a psychopath does NOT imply being malvolent or criminal. In fact, the vast majority of psychopaths are not. So saying Roger is a psychopath by itself is only a characterization if his personality. This by itself is not a problem, and nobody should be blamed alone for being a psychopath. The problem arise if the psychpath uses his skills for selfish and anti-community purposes in a malvolent way.

I am not sure if you are trying to distract the "undecided reader" or if you really mean this. I'll assume the latter.
You are mistaken. The principle remains the same. In a low-profit-margin business, a small change in one component of the overall cost structure can make the difference between "zero profit" (or even a loss) and "comfortable profit" and boost the profit by an arbitrarily high factor.
You, or anyone else, can easily take the sample numbers that I gave in my example and replace it with other numbers, and you'll still be able, even with much lower electricity costs, to convert a loss into a comfortable profit.
@_date: 2015-07-23 20:50:39
I decided to answer your impolite question anyway:
What is accomplished is a solution that is safe against the physical threat outlined in the caricature.The advantage is that a user can carry the smartphone with the Bitcoin wallet app anywhere. A Bitcoin wallet keeps the normal bitcoin balance of the private key that is saved in some form in the phone's flash memory.
The usual problem: If somebody holds a gun at your head, you will probably loose your bitcoins on your smartphone wallet, no matter how good the technical encryption is.
However, the proposed solution means: you can, optionally(!), enter a password, and then the wallet app will generate a new temporary private key as a function of that password AND the default private key ("base key") of the wallet. This new private key only resides in RAM and never in the permanent flash memory. While this key is "active", the user can use the funds of that private key normally. Once you close that mode, the phone forgets that private key and leaves no trace that it ever existed. You can do this game with as many passwords as you want, thereby "unlocking" as many hidden private keys or hidden wallets as you want.
A violent attacker with a gun has no idea, even if he knows the features of that wallet app, how many such hidden wallets (if any at all) that user has, so the user is safe to keep his larger savings and can plausibly deny that he has a hidden wallet, or that he has 2, 3, 4 or 20 hidden wallets.
Now one could ask: But wait, isn't this the same as a brain wallet, just more complicated?
The answer is: No, it has a HUGE advantage over a brain wallet. A brain wallet has a big problem: If the password (or passphrase) of the brain wallet is too simple (too easy to remember often means too easy to guess), any attacker anywhere in the world can brute-force the brain wallet without any need to connect or hack into the user's wallet app. If the brainwallet password is more complicated to avoid such attack, it is much too difficult to remember and hence fails the original purpose of the brain wallet concept.
On the other hand, the proposed solution does not require an overly complicated password. This is because the attacker, to be successful, needs to know not only the password (like in a brain wallet use case) but ALSO the "base" private key of the wallet app. So he needs to hack the phone to get that private key AND then needs to do a brute force attack with that private key. And even then, the attacker never knows where to stop. Even if he found another hidden key by a successful combination of the stolen base private key and a guess of a password, he never knows if further hidden keys (i.e. further passwords for this private key) exist. And when starting that brute force attack, he does not even know if a hidden wallet combined with that base private key exists in the first place. This is an extremely dissatisfying scenario for any attacker.

1. litecoin price correlation with segwit signalling is EXTREMELY strong.
2. unideological common sense: new usecases and growth is good for bitcoin, and markets acknowledge it

Also HF suffers the replay issue if done à la BU.
users/wallets can alleviate replay issue with special split transaction or mixing with already "split" coins.
address confusion is another problem - two "bitcoins" with same address format will cause frequent confusion.
However, the point is that due to the biased risk structure (risk of old-chain to vanish via re-org) combined with the strong market demand for segwit (as we knwo from stron correlation of litecoin price with segwit adoption probability = segwit signalling rate), the "old-chain" will not exist very long and the replay problem will be extremely temporary. Maybe, due to the market forces explained in the slides, the exchanges will not even consider it worthwhile to trade "old-coin" in the first place.
Of course Jihan can still do HF as a defense against UASF (he announced to do so), but who will want to buy those "Jihan-coins"?

so if I understand correctly this means that introducing segwit2mb voting would split segwit voters in two and would further reduce the likelihood of segwit adoption, as either segwitOriginal alone, or segwit2mb alone, would have to achieve 95%.

let's see how the eco-system evolves with LN in Litecoin. News are coming faster than expected.
My honest expectation is it will flourish and be a boon to complement(!) use cases of decentralized cryptos. ignore the fud that LN causes centralization. ignore the fud of its alleged technical debt, ignore the fud that "core" (who is core anyway? - don't overgeneralize from individual statements out if context) wants to have 1MB forever, ignore the "AXA conspiracy", ignore the fud of the evil SegWit "discount" (there's nothing unfair or evil about it at all when understanding it properly) - I mean: For all this: judge it, check it thouroughly, see it cannot withstand serious check, then discard it as what it is - malicious fud.
I don't want to praise myself, but fact is that I used to foresee the big socio-technological evolutions in the recent years/decades well in advance: I foresaw the long-term solar revolution and the internet back in the 80ies when everyone around me still in the mid 90ies said solar will never be competitive (and they meant "never" and not "by the next 30-60 years") and before even the word "internet" was known. I understood in 2000 that the plain and simple "killer app" of UMTS mobile phones will be "plain&amp;simple ubiquitous internet access" while all colleagues from the industry were still watching for "particular applications/use cases" and asked whether internet phones will ever be really needed for a mass market (complete "facepalm" from today's point of view). I understood the implications of Bitcoin immediately after hearing about it back in 2011. I have a very similar vision for LN that will build a whole new eco-system on top of [lite|bit]coin (while the old funtionality still works), and I trust my own nose more than ever :--)

The "miners" are the same individuals in ltc and btc, and have done a clear and rational decision.
for the same rationality they won't accept SegWit in btc and find always new reasons to delay. Unless btc value falls below 100$, this won't change.
I see UASF (actual execution or at least a clear intention) the only solution.
A pre step is bitcoin software introducing possibility for miners to mine in a way that they can proof they are not mining covert-asicboost.
So time is ticking for miners, but they want to make big money as long as possible.

PS: In addition, this coin has an improved and faster difficulty adjustment algo, which is reasonable esp. for an CPU/GPU focussed mining algo that can show particularly quick changes in hash power. Moreover, it supports stealth addresses as a nice privacy (not anonymity) feature.
It is a decent coin and I never understood why it has so low market cap.

The way the discussion went, he was wrong, because the discussion included the several successive steps of borrowing/lending that you are correctly referring to - see below, and was about the "end result" of how much money overall gets created by lending.


yes. ...or 99,000 in the example of fractional reserve ratio=1% (ECB).


Exactly! Good to know that someone else understands the mechanism at least.
And  macro-economically, that comes down to what I said: After several successive steps of borrowing/lending, the 100,000 EUR of cash (M0) brought to a bank can become up to 10 Million EUR of M1 money (electronic money on customer bank accounts) when the fractional reserve ratio is 1%.
In other words: The bank has to keep 1000 EUR cash (=1%) in reserve to "back-up" the 100,000 in the account of the first customer (call him customer "A"). The other 99,000 EUR can be used to give out more credits. So it gives 99,000 of credit to another customer "B". Let's assume "B" immediately withdraws that 99,000. So the bank is left with 1,000 EUR cash whereas customer A's account balance says "100,000 EUR". And that's perfectly ok from accounting because the 1% requirement for fractional reserve is satisfied.
The whole game that we just "played" with 100,000 starts all over with the 99,000 now.
If this goes on several times, the sum of all account balances of customers A, B, C, D, E, F, ... amounts to 10 Mill. EUR, wherase only 100,000 EUR exists in real physical cash (M0).


I didn't say there is, this judgement is another topic. But first one has to understand the working principles.
In my experience, it is amusingly the other people (those who deny this principle of creation of money by fractional reserve banking) who think that this would be "wrong", and because such wrong mechanism cannot be , the mechanism cannot (must not) exist, so they think I must have understood something wrong.

Thanks. Of course solid testing etc. is very important.
However, there is a LITTLE bit of rush because BTC loses out every day the situation stalls, so we must progress, and probably the first step is to provide the possibility to miners to prove that they do not ASICBOOST. Since Jihan has publicly declared that he does NOT use Asicboost in production, he should (if I belive him) not mind, nor should anybody else.
After this first step we may see miners' true faces better than now.
Then the next step is to see if miners change minds and we achieve the same 95% that we are going to achive in Litecoin now for SegWit signalling, or whether we as a community need to reconsider UASF for Bitcoin.
Whatever happens, the Non-SegWit-Proof-of-NoAsicboost softfork is probably the first necessary step, so there will be no progress in Bitcoin before we have that.

The way forward is that the COMMUNITY (i.e. users, exchanges, companies, hodlers) will agree on protocol changes in the form of a soft fork (or even hard fork) that is incompatible with AsicBoost.
Of course today's benefititors of AsicBoost will do all they can to prevent this from happen, like spreading conspiracies against Bitcoin-core, blocksteam etc., and try to make the users belive that the enemy of decentralization is sitting on the other side. It is a war in social media, with lots of fake news, that is already happening and that will intensify. Millions of USD are at stake, so they'll do all they can do discredit the other side and maintain their profits.

* BU as is: never. Reason: Too risky, if legacy chain gets &gt;50% hash power, it causes BU chain to reorg and collaps onto the legacy chain.
* SegWit: Either via UASF (I am sure the market majority (buying power) is there to make it succeed) until mid 2018, or never.    
If never: Major crisis in bitcoin, may look for similar equivalent solution that maintains AsicBoos advantage.    
But I hope and think wallets and exchanges are smart enough to pave the way for allowing the market power (= purchasing money power) to take corrective actions against pow misuse, and allow UASF to happen.

insights for those who have scratched the topic just superficially by now.


it is the purpose to demonstrate what happens when this assumption holds true.
this assumption is not given for sure, but very likely, given the extremely strong correlation beween segwit signalli g petcentage and price in litecoin recently. clearly the markets (= users) put their money where there mouth is, they want SegWit a lot.
if the assumption is not true, the coins will simply coexist. but if the tide turns in favor of uasf chain, it will destroy oldchain and will nullify all investments in it, so investing in oldcoin is extremely risky. this is what the slides illustrate.
@_date: 2017-04-29 12:29:04

Thanks for this question - probably many people think it is equivalent and don't understand all the fuss. So let me explain why there is a decisive difference between an geothermal miner and an asicboost miner:
* The asicboost miner has a **high incentive to block certain protocol evolutions** that would be good for Bitcoin but very bad for him, because he would lose his competitive advantage and migh move from high profit zone to negative profit zone.
* The geothermal miner fully maintains his competitive advantage, no matter what the ptotocol evolution is.

Here is another thing that could be tried:
If "A" is the target address of that transaction, then the owner of "A" (is it yourself? or a friend you know?) might try doing the following:
If the owner of A sees this transaction as "unconfirmed" in his/her wallet, he/she can make a transaction from A to B (with B being another own address), with *sufficient* tx fee (i.e. the low tx fee of your initial tx towards A should be compensated by an accordingly *higher* fee in the tx from A to B). So the miners should include both transactions now, because together the tx fees are high enough of an incentive for the miners to include them in a block. That principle is called "childrens pay for parents" or so I think , and is supported by latest Bitcoin SW afaik, from what I read.

That would then be a different coin. A hard fork. That is a new scenario. This scenario is another topic, and it has been discussed ad vomitum elsewhere in the context of BU, there is even an own subreddit (r/btcfork) for this.
My intention was NOT to discuss the chain split via HF (since this has been discussed 1000s of times) but to think the other scenario through to the end.
That's probably why Jihan was tweeted around 2 weeks ago that he would create a hard-fork Bitcoin (probably BU) in case should UASF become reality, because he also knows that the scenario, as I showed it, does not play out well for the "non-UASF-chain". Personally, I doubt that such an alternative-bitcoin would gain any relevant market acceptance, and I assume that Jihan would not actually do it, because it would harm the bitcoin eco-system so much that even his Asicboost competitive advantage would not be worthwhile doing it.
@_date: 2017-04-18 22:24:15
Hi there. Actual explanation for your question is here:
@_date: 2017-04-24 20:30:30
thanks for the tip. of course segwit would also fix covertboost, but probably it has to be done ni two steps:
- fist covertboost SF. Then we'll see if Jihan stands by his word. He said he does not use asicboost in production (which would be ridiculous if true, because he would forgo millions of profits). If we stays by his word, he'll have no problem following that SF. Otherwise, he might still decide to pretend he said the truth and accept the SF. The third possibility is that he'll recent anti-covertboos SF by some fancy argument to buy more time, and have the complete community (incl. old big-block-friends) against him. So also in this case he'll loos, either by anti-covertboost MASF, or by anti-covertboost UASF (which for sure will succeed).
- second step: once anti-covertboost SF is established, the incentive for blocking SegWit is gone for Jihan. He'll then see that a Bitcoin prive increase is now in his best interst, and he'll find "new" arguments to change his mind end eventually support SegWit. Meanwhile, probably Roger will still vote for BU and anti-segwit, in naive ignorance of what was actually going on.
- Eventually, we'll have SegWit, but we'll have lost time.
After that, eco-systems for LN, decentralized exchanges etc. can evolve, and also Bitcoin-on-chain cpoaccity can grow by another 100%, and on-chain can get offloaded by LN. Meanwhile, RSK (independently of SegWit) will also start to take off.
Meanwhile, better protocol improvements (that are on bcore's roadmap already) can and will be done.
Yet later, we'll hit the next capacity limit, and we'll have another debate on block size. By that time Bitcoin-core will likely, at some point, agree to a block size increase (via HF or SF - different techniques are in discussion for this already now amongst bcore devs), and help Bitcoin to grow further, while remaining decentralized.
Conclusions: Good time ahead, but it will take time.

Not sure if you are trolling or naive. But you can be damn sure you did pay fraud protection ensurance fees. 100% sure!
If you pay with cc, there are fees involved even if you don't see them explicitly. The merchant pays them. And the merchant mirrors these fees onto the prices of the products he's selling. If you buy his products, you pay these fees. What is even worse: You likely even pay ghem if you pay wo cc!
Now you say you use cc since 15 years, so you are at least in your 30s. This is worrying. You are older than 30 and still get fooled by the illusion that cc fees do not cost you anything. It is really beyond me how people can be this naive and like sheep.

With a SegWit transaction, part of the transaction related data that is today stored in a block will be stored not in the block itself anymore, but into a new data structure (segwit data). This frees up space so more transactions fit into an 1 MB block.
The new data structure is part of the overall historical record, so a full node that today stores everything (the complete blockchain) will store both the normal blockchain PLUS the assosiated segwit data - it simply belongs together. This way, this node wouldn't save anything compared to the case that the blocksize would've been increased.
Another node may only store the normal blockchain and omit the segwit data (esp. segwit data of older blocks). Thereby it can save up storage resources, while it can still track all flows of all bitcoins throughout the entire history. This is still possible because this information is stored in the blockchain. Only the SegWit data (signatures) of old transactions can be dropped (pruned).
This is also the reason why the segwit data are allowed to be up to 3 times as big as the blockchain data - because segwit data can be pruned by nodes (and hence cost them less per byte), whereas blockchain data can't.
Note that some people who don't understand this rant against SegWit because of this, how they call it, "SegWit discount", which allegedly is unfair. but there is of course nothing unfair about it, because all bitcoin participants can enjoy the same rules. This also applies to both nirmal users as well as spammers. So w.r.t. fairness it is no less fair than a simple blocksize increase, but it is more space/cost efficient and it has many other advantages beyond the pure scaling aspect, e.g. a fix of tx malleability as a precondition for the Lightning Eco-system, or the prevention of miners covert asicboost mining, and much more.
@_date: 2017-04-22 11:37:04


Not at all. There are such uses for which much more than 1$ of btc tx fee is VERY worthwile.
One application is registering proof of existence of documents into the blockchain. This is a non-money transfer application of bitcoin and hence matches Luke-jr's definition of "spam" (the suitability of this def. is a separate debate).
A company offering such service could collect e.g. 10 Million hashes from 10 Million users (all of which want to register a document), and combine them into one single hash (outside of bitcoin). Then, the company can register this one single hash value into the blockchain by one single bitcoin tx. Even if this single btc tx has a tx fee of $1000, that would be only 0.1 cent per each of the 10 Million users. Probably the company will charge the users at least 10 cent per registration (probably more), so the 0.1 cent extra would be negligible.

The answer is simple: You CAN set and forget, there is no risk for you.
Assume you have your cold wallet as a tattoo-wallet printed on your skin, set off to leave for Mars, and return to earth 30 years later. In the meantime, the Bitcoin chain has split and forked multplie times, some as soft forks, some as hard forks, etc. etc., and now if you go to reddit you'll see that all these child coins have their own subreddit, as well as their own currency smybol on the exchanges, and of course their own blockchain on the nodes: BTC, BTC2, BTC3, BTC4, BTC5 (or other, more fancy names).
But there is one thing that all of these coins have in common: They share the identical history in their blockchain between 3 Jan 2009 up to the point where the first split or fork happened). Since YOUR coins were last moved on the blockchain BEFORE this date, it means that your coins exist on ALL these blockchains. So you'll be able to spend your coins on all of them now, 30 years later.
There is one theoretical "if": Theoretically, we do not knwo how people may have changed the rules for "BTC5" (in above example). Maybe they completely changed the rules, such that any Bitcoin that is not moved for a while starts losing value at a certain percentage per block, so that they reduce the UTXO set or so. This could be some weird rule that is implemented on "BTC5" chain. In this case, of course, since you have not moved your coin for a long time (almost 30 years) on BTC5 chain, liklely you are affectd here. But it is of course very unlikely that such rule gets implemented, and certainly not on the "main" (and most valuable) original Bitcoin chain. So you would not lose much value even under this circumstance.
So you can be pretty sure you can well set and forget.

The factor **19** was first made up by me in [this](  ) post.
The "19" was the outcome of an arbitrary calculation example to show that the profit gain is much higher than what one would think intuitively at first glance.
I went on highlighting that the profit gain is not limited to 19 but can just as well be 190 or infinity ("infinity" being not just a theoretical but very practical possibility), depending on how profitable the miner would be w/o ASICBOOST.
**Had now-bankrupt KNC miner used asicboost, they would have operated very profitable instead of being in negative profit terrain.**

you forget it gets more profitable for the remaining miners as other miners switch off. It will never be completely unprofitable for the most profitable miners who keep on mining (e.g. Island miners with no electricity bill).
Apart from that $100 was just an example (and I said so - "(maybe sub $100)"), so don't pretend (absent) cleverness.


So you seem to be very clever that you can state this number so accurately. But are you really sure it is not $376.89? Your calculations is way too inaccurate!

Don't make a bad political compromise if the community and the markets (and the scientists anyway) agree on what is technically best.
~~America~~ *SegWit* first, keep the system decentralized, then offload via LN (and maybe also RSK and LTC), then see how much decentralization remains to be sacrificed for on chain scaling, and when (it will happen, but not now).
Rushing to one-sided on-chain scaling destroys the main value of Bitcoin, decentralization, unnecessarily and irrevocably.

I'm not terribly concerned if bitcoin just stays the same even though I would prefer segwit activation. Sure, it limits the usability, but if we don't fork then bitcoin has won.
I am a little less optomistic. I think if litecoin (or another bitcoin clone, maybe even vertcoin) activated segwit and enabled all the new use cases and bitcoin remained in today's state forever, first use, then investors, then market cap, would divert away from bitcoin until it became a niche-coin.
I am curious to see how this plays out. But I am seeing a paradigm shift from "miners determine bitcoin" to "users and the market determines what bitcoin is" as one possible game changer.
Interesting times ahead.

It is true. Why do you spread FUD by saying it "may not be true"?
If you sell within a year (fifo), you have to pay tax on the gains in the form of "Abgeltungssteuer (25%) + Soli (5.5% of that 25%)". You never pay more (since 2009). If your personal "Grenzsteuersatz" is below 25% (people with low income), you can claim parts or all of that back in the "Steuererklärung".
If you sell crypto (or things like physical(!) gold, silver, works of art, jewelry) after holding more than a year, all gains are generally tax-free.

It depends WHAT you sell!
If you sell shares, it applies independent of the holding time (since 2009).
If you sell physical gold or cryptos, the 1 year holding time applies.
The "Abgeltungssteuer" is a mechanism to calculate the amount of tax, GIVEN that it is taxable in the first place.
Whether it is taxable in the first place is dependent on the kind of asset you are selling.

UASF does not rely on node count. This is a frequent misconception.
UASF's success simply comes when market demand (what people around the world are willing to pay with their money) is in favour of the UASF. This is the best incentive structure I can think of - and for sure better than a pure dogmatic POW-only-under-all-and-any-circumstances based rule set.
You can think of it this way: POW secures the bitcoin in normal times, but if pow behaves against market majority's interests, market can put corrective action via UASF, which pulls pow back on the right path. This is a really neat mechanism.

if market price of uasf chain coins is (much (much)) higher than legacy chain, miners will switch to mine uasf out of sheer self interest very quickly.
short time after uasf becomes longest chain, so old chain reorgs to merge onto uasf chain, and that's it.
So the driver that decides in the end is market demand and nothing else. hash rate simply follows market price closely out of egoistic rational behaviour.

if antpool has asicboost, what you call irrational is in fact VERY rational by them in economical terms.

Please be reminded that SegWit is primarily a protocol improvement fixing old problems and opening up a whole set of new use cases like Lightning Network (bringing micropayments, trustless crypto-currency exchanges, on-chain offloading and more), dramatically growing Bitcoin eco-system and hence Bitcoin valuation, mid- to long-term.
It also paves the way for further scaling improvments like schnorr signatures.
The short term capacity increase (roghly +100%) that SegWit brings is more of a welcome side-effect.
Opposite to that, a simple blocksize increase would not bring any of these far-reaching changes and would only temporarily alleviate capa-shortage and increasing TxFees while degrading Bitcoin's decentralization, which is paramount for its long-term success.

That's why I think the optional "trust layer" on top of legacy pow is viable, but I think it's rejected because of insisting on purely "trusless ideology" and/or because it is little understood.
It goes like this: every honest node can configure his node with some parameters and some "somewhat trusted" public keys.
The parameters determine what kind of blocks will be rejected. e.g. rollbacks by 6 or more blocks will be rejected if arriving more than 15 min delayed, no matter how much longer the other chain is, because that huge delay is certainly an attack. Moreover, other nodes running the same checks will broadcast signed lists of block hashes that they consider malicious, based on their own criteria. My own node can thus cross-check its own judgement with that of the other blocks. if some node operators whpm I trust, like e.g. coinbase, or bitpay, or gavin, or greg, or slush ... have come to the same judgement, my own node is certain that these blocks are really malicious and won't accept them. the others will do the same.
So a 51% blockchain rollback attack won't succeed, it will be rejected by the honest social community! And because attackers know this, they will likely never even try this attack! So the pure fact that the workable defense mechanism is in place will cause the attack to never happen, because the only looser would be the attacker.

Thank you indeed for the clarification/confirmation.
Just another question: How does a SegWit transaction appear to a legacy software node? Is it like an "anybody can spend" transaction or something like that?
For example, can it happen that a transaction is broadcast to the network that is considered valid by legacy nodes but invalid by SegWit nodes? If so, the legacy nodes may - at least temporarily - work on the wrong chain. "Temporarily" because if the legacy nodes are in hash power minority, their chain will eventually be overtaken by the SegWit chain, and the legacy nodes will then be working on the longest chain again. So as long as SegWit miners have &gt;50%, the SegWit chain will be the surviving chain. But Non-SegWit miners would then be relatively easily attackable by sending "invalid" transactions to them, which make them create orphaning blocks. So as a matter of fact, any miner who wants to avoid this risk, is de-facto obliged to update to a SegWit software, and then read the complete transaction data for validation, not only the "core legacy 1MB-per_block blockchain".
Is my understanding correct?
I understand that this is a difference to a hardfork where both chains would be permanently split, at least theoretically. Practically the shorter hardforked chain would quickly die since miners would jump to the longer chain for economical reasons. And, as described above, in the softfork scenario the legacy nodes have to update anyways to avoid substantial economical disadvantages. So in either case, HF or SF, nodes would "have to" jump to the new software. So practically I see no scenario where there is a real difference between SF and HF.
So I do not see what is bad about a hardfork, as long as it keeps Bitcoin's social contract: For example an increase of block size limit (=hence a hardfork) was a clear part of Bitcoin's social contract ever since (remember Satoshi's clear statement in his post in 2010 - the 1MB was always meant as a temporary anti-spam-safeguard, nothing permanent at all), whereas keeping block size limit at 1MB for too long (=no hardfork) is AGAINST the social contract. So clearly, the question what is good/right and what is bad/wrong is not to be determined by the question whether something is a hardfork or not. I perceive this hardfork-criterion as really artificial (and hypocritical) in the discussion, and I have the impression that this criterion ("HF=evil") is used as an instrument to legitimize the interests and actions of certain groups who actually act against Bitcoin's social contract and legitimize their deeds with this hypocritical argument.

An ETF is a special kind of ETP.
So you are saying that this ETP is not an ETF but another kind of ETP, and media falsely refer to it as ETF. Well, that would explain a lot of the confusion around here.
So what kind of ETP is it? Is there another name for it (ETV, ETN, EYC, ...), or is it too manifold and we just have to say it is a special kind of ETP?

Ok, then things are clarified.
Note that other people may disagree with you as not everybody has the means to put a gold vault into the basement, get insurance for it, and sell grams of gold from the 1kg gold bar thanks to having access to a gold smith, and all this at low costs. So some people say it's a good idea to outsource this to ETFs.
I think ETFs for gold are reasonable for that reason.
For Bitcoin ETFs I am of a different opinion for what Andreas A. says in his video starting 2:45. I fully agree with his points.

That's nothing special. That's how the fiat money system is designed to work.

Thanks a lot for your explanation efforts. But I must admit that I still don't see the problem resolved. May I ask you once more? Here's what my problem is:


Carol has traded the ruby red gem for a mBTC with Dave a long time ago, yes. But that happened off-chain and is not documented anywhere (we assume all payment channels involved are still open).
So Bob and Carol can *do as if* the trade between Dave and Carol never happened. This is my point.
As a result, we have two contradicting transactions off-chain. Now how can Alice be sure that not the wrong one (the one involving Bob) gets settled on the Blockchain?

I also like the idea of giving concrete examples to clarify the actual usage, so that it can be understood by everybody.
However, if you allow me to make a constructive remark nevertheless: The "examples" are not really examples but just generic usage explanations. An example is something that, if you type it in literally(!), shall work without modification.
Example of such an "example" which is not really an example:
    Examples:
    
    Create the signature
    &gt; bitcoin-cli signmessagewithprivkey "privkey" "my message"
    
    Verify the signature
    &gt; bitcoin-cli verifymessage "1D1ZrZNe3JUo7ZycKEYQQiQAWd9y54F4XX" "signature" "my message"
E.g "privkey" is not a valid example for a private key. Same for "signature", which certainly is no valid example for a signature. On the other hand, "1D1ZrZNe3JUo7ZycKEYQQiQAWd9y54F4XX" is a valid example of an address, and "my message" is a valid example of a message.

We are discussing your comment, not your conviction. if you bash bitcoin and at the same time reassure you are a bitcoin friend, i cannot help your schizophrenia.
fact is: If you explain why bitcoin won't recover by naming only arguments against btc (and those even partly incorrectly, as I have pointed out and won't repeat) and leave out arguments for the other side, well, then of course it is easy to explain why bitcoin won't recover.
You can explain anything with this strategy.

Yes I know about bip39 and the need for a private backup etc., and I know that Coinomi (like most Android wallets) encrypts the private key with a PIN number before storing it in the phone. But that was not my question. My question was whether Android / Google mechanisms exist that cause that (weakly encrypted) key (i.e. the app's user data) to be stored at any location outside of my phone, like a google server.
I understood from the other replies that the answer is probably "no", although nobody seemed to be very sure. I think it's only what people believe (and what is also plausible), but I would feel more comfortable if someone could explain why exactly the answer is "no".

At some remote point in time increasing blocksize makes sense if we want real mainstream adoption, because if you do the math, you readily find out that current block size is only providing enough tx capacity for 10 billion people to open and close one(!) LN channel in their entire life!
Or by that time we have a bigger blocksize side chain with 2-way peg, and the "normal people" never use bitcoin but only one of the various sidechain coins. That would be the other possibility, and maybe more likely scenario. Of course LN can also be established over these side chain coins.

A **pure exchange** can do it exactly as described above. The signed public list could be made available for download as plain text file on the exchange's public home page.  
(if the exchange is concerned about publicly disclosing wealth distribution of his user base and prefers to keep this a company business secret, it should implement the measures listed below for "wallet services")
A **wallet service** where users can receive bitcoins, an additional measure is needed to make sure that user privacy cannot be compromised by a "privacy attacker".
The "privacy attack" would go like this:
The attacker sends e.g. 0.00003847 bitcoins to a certain user (the victim or target of the privacy attack) in the middle of two publishing events of said public list. Then the attacker compares the two public lists before and after his transfer, and searches for that user ID whose balance has changed by 0.00003847 BTC. If that balance had other incoming/outgoing transfers in that time interval, the attack will fail. But otherwise, it succeeds, and the attacker now has a mapping between the public (pseudonymous) user ID and the actual identification.
**Counter measure:**
* -&gt; 1. User ID changes each time that the list of pseudonymous balances gets published, by changing the "salt" each time. Remember that user ID is a function of real user name (and perhaps address, birth date, email or so) and(!) a random salt. The history of salts and corresponding user IDs is always visible to the user in his/her login area.
* -&gt; 2. Each user has not only one user ID but at least two (better: e.g. ten) user IDs associated with it at each publishing time. In the public list, his actual account balance is distributed over all these (ten) user IDs in a random manner. This obfuscates the user ID tracking for a privacy attacker.
This way, the privacy attacker can no more identify the user IDs that contain the difference of his 0.00003847 BTC transfer.
To obfuscate it even more, a third measure is possible:
* -&gt; 3. The online wallet service can increase the balance in the public list by a few satoshis for the user IDs of the victim user. This way the attacker's 0.00003847 BTC will not show up anywhere, even if the attacker tries out every combination to "reconstruct" wich user IDs may belong together.    
Clearly, this 3rd measure only works if the exchange has (at least slightly) more than 100% reserves, but this can be assumed to be the case in all realistic cases. Note we are only talking about small satoshi or cent amounts. So the "reserve surplus" by the exchange / online wallet can be used to artificially increase the published balances of user IDs in a random manner at each "publishing time", thereby effectively obfuscating actual wallet differences between publishing times, making it virtually impossible for the privacy attacker to find out what was going on.
Further improvement:
* -&gt; 4. Instead of splitting a user's balance over a fixed amount of e.g. ten public pseudonymous user IDs in the public list, split it over "n" user IDs, where n is larger if the balance is higher.     
To get the idea:
 * In the extreme case it would be as many user IDs as there are satoshis in the user's balance! This would create perfect(!) obfuscation, because an observer of the public list would have no idea how many users there are or how balances are distributed between "rich" and "poor" users.
 * Practically, the granularity of user IDs could be made more coarse (to reduce the number of user IDs per user and overall), while still hiding the wealth distribution of user accounts sufficiently well. An example could be to follow this strategy:     
.   
-&gt; Each user gets a minimum of [ten] user IDs at each publication time.   
.   
-&gt; Each user gets more user IDs if necessary, such that in the public list each user ID has a balance of no more than [m] satoshis. Clearly, for m=1 we have our extreme case.

My understanding:
The goal of decentralization is that there are so many(!) users with full(!) nodes that it is unrealistic that one/some play(s) a bad game unnoticed.
The goal is not that every user of the currency (and I stand by MY definition of "user") operates a full node.
*A "user" is someone who uses the currency, in whatever way. Also someone only using online wallets is a user.*
*Users running full nodes are more than just users - they are also operators of the network.*

...and as adoption grows, I expect another LN network over Liquid as a logical result. Reason: With all earthlings adopting LN, the Bitcoin network has just enough capacity the let every earthling only open/close one LN channel in a lifetime(!) (= ca. 100 years). This is of course way too little. So new users moving in to Bitcoin may decide to convert their fiat directly to Liquid rather than BTC, as Liquid has higher capacity. And then, to facilitate micro-payments, of course also Liquid on-chain has not enough capacity. So LN over Liquid is the logical consequence.

I prefer the list on the side, as it is always there also after lookup, no need to use the back button. But I'd put the list to the left of the page. Independent scrolling of the list view at the side would be preferable.
Having the page split in two parts like that is usful in other application as well, e.g. in file explorers (tree view on the left) or pdf readers / power point (list of contents in the narrow left part).

lighning is limited for mass adoption. One person on earth can open only one lightning chanel in a lifetime. So lightning doesn't scale on bitcoin with mass adoption. As RSK has much higer on-chain capacity, LN over RSK does scale.

They are not right on point 3.
they could easily provide a prove of reserves without violation of user privacy.
By publishing a list of user ids with associated balances, the list signed with their priv keys. the user ids are only known by the respective users themselves and do not contain real names.
The gold company bullionvault (you can buy physical gold there) proves their reserves of gold in a similar way. With bitcoin it would be so much easier to do this. It is beyond me why this is not yet industry standard for all reputable exchanges/wallet services.

There's nothing wrong AT ALL with a pre-loaded chain. If your SW verifies it, it provides the exact same security, but you save time and cost for downloading it.
This is the magic of how the blockchain is secured - a chain of hashes. If the pre-loaded blockchain  had a flaw (even if just a single bit), your SW would find it and reject the preloaded blockchain as invalid.

Thanks, but I already knew all that you explained.
My question was another one. You can just re-read my question, then you'll understand my actual question hopefully.
Anyway, I'll re-phrase my question again:


Here is my question: What if Bob does nothing at this point? Then Alice has to find another way to pay Carol, maybe via Dave instead of via Bob - hopefully Dave is more attentive than Bob.
Now after the LN payment (off-chain, I know, because it is LN!) via Dave succeeded, all is good. But wait! There is still this message that Alice sent over to Bob some days earlier. Eventually, after 30 days Bob wakes up and finalises the original payment from Alice to Carol via Bob.
How can Alice be sure that this won't happen?

Yes tech moves fast, but this is about more than just tech. It is about people changing minds and habbits. Old people won't be willing or able to change. Some people still buy paper newspapers today although tech is beyond that for a long time. Some people still go to their local bank branch to initiate wire transfers or get account statements. And some people still think that eating mammals instead of insects or maggots is less disgusting and more ethical and environmentally friendly. And I could give many more examples.
I think certain things take generational time dimensions, like important changes of values in society.

So you prefer expressing Bitcoin value in units of fiat valu rather than in units of real world goods?
Why do you give a fiat currency so much credit, and give it more credit than real world objects?
The purpose of currency is to be able to exchange it for real world goods. If you think the purpose of a currency is to exchange it for a certain number of units of a certain fiat currency (here USD), then I doubt that you have understood any currency at all - neither fiat nor Bitcoin.

how it can go to zero?
* it can only go to zero if people give their bitcoins away for free, and so many of them that it fulfills all world demand, ie all ppl on earth get as many btc as they like for free.
* due to a flaw in the protocol or security bitcoin falls apart and becomes unusable.

it is when the last N blocks of the blockchain get replaced by another N (and then N+1) blocks. These N+1 blocks have been mined by the 51% attacker in secret and is then all of a sudden published to replace the former N blocks, because the new N+1 blocks are the longer chain (contain more work). If it happens often, or for N&gt;1, we can assume that it was the result of an attack.

Whoever bought the BTC from the MtGox trustee would have bought it elsewhere if the trustee had not existed. That would have shifted the supply/demand balance and would have impact on price.

I don't understand. There is nothing like a gem, literally. In the digital world you can copy-paste everything. Only in blockchain ON-chain that does not work. But we are talking off-chain here.
Maybe another example makes it clearer:
Alice pays Carol via Bob and she pays Carol via Dave in LN. Both Carol and Bob do not know about each other and forward the payment to Carol. Carol processes both of them equally etc. It does not matter whether the way via Bob was delayed by Bob for 5 days or both happens simultaneously.

Hard to say. The market is definitely more desperate now than what it was in the 6k range. But I am not yet convinced that we have seen the bottom already. To my taste it's still too optimistic, i.e. I expect the bottom yet to come.
In the end, nobody can make predictions with certainty, because it depends on events in laws, regulations, political and fiscal decisions, the stock market, other world events, and of course news from the bitcoin world. And on top of all that comes the psychology of the traders and private and institutional investors, how they interpret these signs.
I personally see a 20% likelihood that the bottom remains above 3k, 60% that it bottoms out between 1.5k and 3k, and 20% that it falls below 1.5k (splitting this 20% into 15% above 900 and 5% sub-900).
Unless something terrible happens, I expect a moderate upturn around Q3/2019 leading us to price levels of 2-3 times "bottom" by mid 2020 (wherever that "bottom" is). I see prices above 10k not in 2019, and new ATH (i.e. surpassing 20k) at earliest 2020 (probability=10%), but more likely 2021 or later (p=90%), possibly not before around 2023-2024 (p=65%).
I see the often-quoted 6-digit prices not before 2025 (and only if circumstances remain favourable in the face of risks, see below) (p=80%).
All this is quite difficult to "predict" of course, because of way too many unknowns, like e.g. (in no particular order):
Up(+) / Down(-) potential because of:
* (+) India legalizing Bitcoin and local exchanges
* (+) Euro currency crisis in Europe e.g. due to Italy
* (+) Another banking crisis (Europe, world)
* (+) Accelerating inflation in USD due to USD ponzi scheme becoming more and more apparent, US economy too weak to justify amount of new debt each year.
* (+) Big players (companies) adopting Bitcoin/LN
* (+) Firefox/Mozilla/Smartphone OS providing native BTC/LN support (without plugins)
* (+) LN with cool GUI for end users, and watch tower services
* (+) Side chains (rsk or alike) with 2-way peg opening to individual users, boosting tx capacity enormously, trading rsk (or alike) vs. btc on exchanges to reduce amount of 2-way-peg on chain TXs (still 3+ years ahead)
* (+) Market starting pricing-in anticipated Block reward halving event around May 2020.
* (+) ETF (not other kind of ETP) accepted with requirement for 100% backing by BTC (unlikely, ca. 20%)
* (-) ETF rejected (more likely, ca. 80%)
* (-) ETF accepted, but long term getting too much power over Bitcoin as a dominating market participant, destroying BTC's original value proposition (see also Andreas Antonopulous' concerns why Bitcoin ETFs are a bad idea) - more of a mid-long-term concern for price for 4+ years after ETF gets licensed.
* (+/-/?) Stock market crash, world recession ("+" because ppl flee into btc &amp; gold, or "-" because ppl sell btc to cover living expenses after getting unemployed)
* (+) Space company mining gold from asteroid (15+ years from now), investors move from gold to btc because of new inflation of gold. (similar effect as the sudden growth of supply of gold after the spanish brought gold from south america in the 16th century)
* (-) Legal Bitcoin ban in favour of Central Bank issued digital tokens, in important countries (would revolutionize banking money system, to happen not before 3+ years from now)
* (-) Sun flares like 100 years ago, destroying significant parts of energy and communication infrastructure both in space (satellites) and on earth (transmission lines...) - effect on Bitcoin would be the smallest problem in our modern society, logistics standstill, anarchy in big cities, food shortages, ...
* (-) 51% attack coordinated by a state/central bank, disagreement in Bitcoin community how to handle it (checkpoints? PoW Algo change? regular change? algorithmic change schedule?), hard forks, media talk of a "finally failed experiment" ...
* (-) quantum computer or mathematical approach to weaken Bitcoin encryption (unlikely near-mid term)
* (-) little innovation for protocol or GUI enhancements and corporate adoption, falling below expectations, stagnation
...and I probably forgot many other opportunities and risks.

on the other hand there are ways to secure bitcoins that gold does not offer, like multisig. imagine you have a 5 of 7 multisig, and you save the 7 private keys in cold storage at vaults in different geographical places by different people. all 7 keys were generated offline, by different tools, using physical randomness (which is easy and should be best practice).
So stealing this bitcoin would be like physically breaking into vaults of Hong Kong, London, Zurich, US, and elsewhere, at the same time.

Thanks for the clarification.
hmm - that seems dangerous and worrisome to me - a possible attack vector can be to load malicious code from an infected computer onto the ledger.
the basic paradigm of ledger being immune against any possible infection of the connected computer seems not given. Therefore I would only use ledger on an "always-offline" PC that I know is free of malicious software. But then I can use electrum in offline mode and don't need a ledger device at all.

I did not understand the timeout thing. If Alice sends 1 mBTC to Carol VIA Bob, Alice wants to know if the payment gets through or not. Maybe Bob is lazy and does not route it through immediately. But maybe he'll do so 5 days later. By that time, Alice may have already paid Carol via Dave, as Bob was sleeping. So now Alice has paid Carol twice.
As all this is off-chain, how can this be avoided?

I thought so. Interesting. Because, if it were structured like an ETF that has to balance its underlying, GBTC would have bought many bicoins on the free market, thereby created extra demand, and the Bitcoin price level today would be higher, representing the actual demand.

Today, as too many pull out their fiat from their private bank, the private bank still remains solvent by getting new cheap money from the lender of last resort, the central bank, which creates real(!) fiat money out of nothing and lends it to the private bank in trouble for 0% interest, to stay solvent.
So the ponzi scheme can grow endlessly.
This would not be possible, so without such lenders of last resort, in a Bitcoin based bank system, we'd see bank crashes much sooner, before it gets systemically unhealthy, and the financial system would remain stable (and people more sensitive about whom [which bank] they trust).

Wrong. Many ETFs have only one underlying. E.g. Gold ETFs.
There are reasons why investors would prefer investing in ETFs rather than the underlying directly. Examples:
- No need to hold and secure the "physical" underlying (gold vault, crypto-knowledge, ...)
- outsource the securing, insurance to the ETF company and focus on only investing.
Might be different for you personally, but for many investors these are very relevant points. Believe it or not, many investors are NOT experts in gold vaults, computer science, etc.

No. The daily weighted average(!) on bitstamp(!) was &gt;1000 USD on 5 out of 6 successive days between 29 Nov and 4 Dec 2013. On 1st Dec it was 945 USD. On 28 Nov it was 998 USD. On 5 Dec it was 975 USD.
So you could roughly say it was &gt;1000 USD for a week, not an hour.

Of course a GPU has an ASIC inside. So has every chip. But when we talk about "ASIC" in the context of cryptos, we mean an Application Specific Integrated Circuit that is application specific w.r.t. mining a particular coin, i.e. a hardware that cannot be used for other main stream purposes. Likewise, when we talk about an ASIC-free coin we talk about a coin that is designed for mining with GENERAL PURPOSE hardware and does not require purchase of specialized mining hardware, to be able to mine economically.
This probably was not clear, so we talked about different things when using the term "ASIC" in the context of crypto coins.

Good idea. But why an extra token? why not an established crypto like bitcoin, possibly with LN?
And how is the sender going to pay the fee to 21.co if he has no wallet of that token? Does the sender first have to create a wallet with the new token?? This is not explained in the article - probably this is the catch.
Moreover, why does 21.co need to read my email instead of just reading the headers (actually only "from" and "reply to" addresses) of the incoming emails?
And why does 21.co want to "modify" my emails?

Almost 100% sure the wrong answer. Or do you really believe there will be no more forks?
@_date: 2017-09-23 10:06:19
ah yes of course. and hardfork some 6 weeks later. interesting times ahead.
@_date: 2017-09-17 10:38:14
technically yes.
while miners cannot enforce hardforks if the market does not buy their new coin, miners can enforce a softfork with a 51% majority of hashing power.
Examples would be:
* all blocks must be &lt; 500kB
* blocks must not contain a spending from a certain (blacklisted) address
* blocks that are empty or almost empty despite full mempool and sufficient time since last block.
If miners maliciously do such a 51% attack, markets and community can answer with a (temporary) hard fork as follows:
Declare the block hash of that block as "invalid" that was identified as "malicious", i.e. reject that block and disregard a "longest chain" if it contains blacklisted (=malicious) block hashes.
As markets will not accept that block, attackers won't mine on top of the malicious block any more, so the dishonest chain will not be the longest chain any more - that's why the defending "hard fork" to a malicious "soft fork" can be considered "temporary".

I read the text on bitcoin.org.
To avoid that people can attack bitcoin.org for being biased rather than objective, I propose that bitcoin.org shall also demand from the companies to not embezzle s2x balances. I.e. a company shall not hide users' s2x balances but make them available to their users, too (if the hf happens and s2x value becomes none-negligible).
Forgetting to demand this could be perceived as bitcoin.org being more interested in bitcoin's interest than in user protection.
While the former is crucially important and I firmly agree, I think staying balanced is important to get the nain message through in a credible way.

Your statement that BTC goes up if Roger sells all his BTC is a troll comment of the quality of r/btc, and not a mathematically based prognosis, hence I cannot upvote your post.

I guess a social contract is only worth a social contract if this contract is commonly known to everybody, not just insiders, and openly communicated as a core principle. Like the 21 Mill boundary of bitcoin.
So I am sure that bitcoin's social contract on pow change was a very "weak" contract. On the contrary, for vertcoin it is a regularly communicated core value explained to newbies all the time, it has a much higher relevance than what it ever had for bitcoin. It's at the heart of vertcoin, its main differentiator and its "reason for being".

B2X was not even born and is not dead. Outcome is open. My personal bet is it won't live long (less than 100 blocks to protect Roger from losing 1000 BTC), but others have other bets. Saying today it is dead is a lie as a matter of fact, and ignorant'n arrogant at best.

Oh, ok, so you talk more about the "transition phase", like the first blocks after the PoW change, unitl th first difficulty adjustment etc. Yes, here I agree of course - it needs some time until that equilibrium that I mentioned is reached, i.e. until all miners are up'n running. So people would have to beware of reorgs more than usual during that phase and wait more confirmation than usual.


As I said, the reason is not that it is ASICs securing the network. The main reason is the **value**. The more valuable the mining profits per day are, the more expensive it is for an attacker. Linear relation ship. THIS is why Bitcoin is the most secure network. If it had an ASIC-free GPU mining algorithm, it would still be the most secure coin, simply for the exact reason I stated.
If you try to make people believe that the high number of hashes that these ASICs calculate per second is magically providing the security, then you are behaving like a miner's lobbyist.


See my first paragraph's text a few lines above. I agree for the "transtion phase".


My assumption would be that the new PoW is a gerneral purpose HW-optimised algo like the GPU algo used by Vertcoin. Then Bitcoin would get rid of the dependency on miner cartels as a side effect, and Bitcoin would belong more to the people again. It would be perceived as a "freedom act" by the community. The only disadvantge would be that it would struck Vertcoin hard, as it fills exactly this gap. The new Bitcoin could "copy" Vertcoin's social contract to remain ASIC-free and even commit itself to future hardforks of the mining algo to remain ASIC free.


Don't make premature conclusions - think and discuss first! :-)

Scam in so far as it has a premine. No need for such a coin. The honest variant of that (with asic resistance and social contract to switch pow if asics should appear) exists already, it is called vertcoin. If the makers had sincere intentions, they would contribute there. But they prefer to get rich quick via this HF. That's what I call a scam. Of course anyone is free to (not to) use it. A scam nevertheless.  Everybody is free to create scams in a free world, this does not mean scams don't exist.

The last time there was a widespread physical gold counterfeiting scare was in the summer of 2012 when as we reported the discovery of a single 10 oz Tungsten-filled gold bar in Manhattan's jewelry district led to a panic among the dealer community, which then resulted in local jewelry outlets discovering at least ten more fake 10-ounce "gold bars" filled with Tungsten. Fast forward to today when a similar instance of gold counterfeiting has been discovered, this time in Canada, and where the fake bar in question had been "certified" by the highest possible authority.
According to CBC, the Royal Canadian Mint is investigating how a sealed, "pure gold" wafer with proper mint stampings has emerged as a fake. According to the Canadian press, the one-ounce gold piece, which was supposed to be 99.99% pure, was purchased by an Ottawa jeweller on Oct. 18 at a Royal Bank of Canada branch. The problem emerged when tests of the bar showed it may contain no gold at all. And, when neither the mint nor RBC would take the bar back, jeweler Samuel Tang contacted CBC news.
*Joy Creations owner Samuel Tang contacted CBC News when neither RBC nor the mint would take back the one-ounce gold piece he'd purchased*
Who is going to make sure those [gold wafers] are real?" asked Tang. "I am worried there are more of those [gold wafers] out there, and no one knows."
Following the news, RBC felt an obligation to pick up the bar and returned it to the mint for testing, refunding Tang the $1,680 purchase price.
The Royal Canadian Mint said in a statement to CBC it is in process of testing the bar, **"although the appearance of the wafer and its packaging already suggests that it is not a genuine Royal Canadian Mint product."**
*Samuel Tang purchased what he thought was a one-ounce bar of 99.9999% pure, Royal Canadian Mint gold from a Royal Bank branch*
Questions about the fake bar's origins aside, a more immediate concerns is that, just like in 2012, if there is one fake bar, there are likely many more. William Rentz, a professor at the University of Ottawa's Telfer School of Management and an expert on investments and equity, says the discovery is "troubling."
**"A currency counterfeiter doesn't make just one fake $50 bill," he said. "They make a whole lot of them. So I would suspect this might just be the tip of the iceberg."**
While the RCMP said they are aware of the incident, no formal complaint has yet been made.
. * * *
As CBC details, the mystery of the fake gold began on Oct. 18, when Tang purchased what he thought was a 99.99% pure gold wafer from an RBC branch just across the road from his Glebe-area boutique, Joy Creations.
* He carried the business-card-sized bar, still sealed in its Royal Canadian Mint blister-pack, back to his shop.    
  His goldsmith, Dennis Barnard, said he cut open the plastic mint packing and placed the one-ounce wafer in a hand-cranked jeweller's tableting mill.    
  "I thought my age was catching up with me — because it was so hard to roll," said Barnard.
Once doubts emerged about the integrity of the gold bar, Barnard tried bending the wafer, as pure gold is usually pliable and can be bent easily. Instead, the goldsmith said the wafer snapped, leaving a jagged line.
*Goldsmith Dennis Barnard subjected the bar to an acid test after he found 
he wasn't strong enough to roll the metal flat in his jewellers' mill*
"That's when I started realizing something is amiss," said Barnard, who then proceeded to test the gold himself, using an acid testing kit. In an acid test, the jeweller rubs a streak of the metal across an abrasive test stone. Then, a drop of pre-mixed acid is added to the center of the streak.
If the metal streak changes colour or disappears, then the metal is less than the karat of the test acid. Gold of 99% purity is considered to be equal to 24-karat gold. But the bar from RBC failed a test that gold of 18-karat or higher purity would pass.
*A metal streak from a counterfeit gold bar, right, dissolved in acid, failing a test of purity*
That's when Tang contacted RBC.
**"This could be huge. There could be quite a few people out there who've been rolled over,"** said Barnard.
The news turned from bad to worse when CBC took the same bar to Ernest Marbar, owner of the Gold Lobby, an Ottawa buyer of precious metals. Marbar also found the bar failed an acid test for 14-karat gold. His conclusion: **"The bar that came from that package is a piece of junk"** the gold expert said, adding that the **"million-dollar question"** is **"how it ended up in that plastic case."**
*Ernest Marbar, owner of the Gold Lobby, an Ottawa buyer of precious metals, dismissed the wafer as 'a piece of junk'*
Back at Joy Creations, goldsmith Barnard said his concern wasn't with goldsmiths being duped, it's with end buyers of the product who assume the purity and quality of the mint-endorsed purchases are sacrosanct: **he and Tang are worried the bogus gold could be widely distributed and difficult to find, since most buyers are investors and leave the metal in the mint's blister-packed cases.**
"Who's going to run around and open their packages, which are sealed by the mint?" asked Barnard. It's a concern echoed by professor Rentz: **"It's a serious problem. If the trust disappears, it could be seize up the market, at least temporarily."**
Ultimately, the onus is on the those who endorsed the fake product - the mint. Rentz said the mint would be motivated to get to the bottom of this case, since the discovery of a counterfeit undermines confidence in their product.
Meanwhile, Tang said last Monday he spoke with the manager of the RBC branch where he purchased the bar. He said the manager was told by a mint dispatcher they were checking security footage, and trying to trace everyone involved in the handling of the bars.
Amusingly, if the swap turns out to be an inside job, it wouldn't be the first time. As we reported at the time, last September, 35-year-old Leston Lawrence was **found guilty of smuggling C$180,000 worth of gold pucks, each the size of a small muffin, in his rectum over several months.**  Lawrence worked at the mint from July 2008 until March 2015. The punchline: his job included ***purifying*** gold...

They are using segwit or "full blocks" as a means to fork bitcoin, and will continue to use any other excuse that comes in handy to further fork Bitcoin into pieces.
The target is to (a) get rid of the most capable bitcoin core developers, and (b) to weaken Bitcoin by forking it into many, preferably equally large, pieces, thereby destroying the network effect.
Since this attack comes (seemingly) from inside of the Bitcoin community, it is particularly evil. The attackers use allegedly simple-to-understand populistic arguments to solve complex problems with simple recipes and thereby capture less tech savvy or less capable Bitcoin users and investors.
It is practically impossible today to tell which advocate or troll for a malicious Bitcoin fork is having bad intentions or just has fallen for the propaganda of these Bitcoin populists.

Yes. And there is another reason why it is an attack: It uses the same mining resources, and by analysing and thinking through the mechanisms of difficulty adjustment and miner economical incentives, we can readily see:
If B2X gets permanently higher market value than Bitcoin BTC, it would cause mining Bitcoin being unprofitable for a time of many many weeks, such that only idealist miners would mine BTC (with high losses they can never make up again). Such periods of low tx capa and very long block times would alternate with short (&lt;&lt;14 days) periods of high capa and short block times, during which mining would be highly profitable (also economical miners would join in during this phase). This oscillation would go on forever. Bitcoin wouldn't survive this very long without a change of difficulty adjustment algo and possibly pow algo, both being  an enforced HF on BTC.
That's why you were right considering it an attack, even without their behaviour w.r.t replay protection and disguise.

Good point. So it will get worse over time, with increasing adoption. Important to have things settled by then. Things like Schnorr and (what was the other technology thing again in the planning) should be done soon, as well as a sustainable solution for moderate blocksize increase not endangering decentralization (like block size increase with technological growth increase - but hard to put this into a mathematical protocol - it was discussed for years... a ca. fixed 20% increase p.a. with a cap after e.g. 25 years (=factor 100 over today) for a revision might help).

s2x supporters say miners mine B2X, so BTC gets slow and low capa, as a result value drops due to loss of utility, up until no miner mines on BTC any more.
I say BTC is vauled higher on the markets, even before the HF, so miners will mine the more profitable coin which is BTC, and thus B2X dies as it does not get mined any more.

You did not read properly and misunderstood! It is not about checking for a certain hash value, but a block's SIZE!
Checking for blocks obeying Bitcoin's **consensus rules** is NOT a HARDFORK! It is normal desired (and mandatory) behaviour of any FULL NODE!
The problem is that normal LIGHT wallets, as opposed to full nodes, don't download the complete blocks but just the block headers, and hence cannot verify if blocks are &gt; 1MB or do otherwise violate consensus rules (like e.g. containing invalid transactions stealing bitcoins). Light wallets just follow the chain with the most POW (commonly referred to as "longest chain"), no matter whether that chain follows Bitcoin's consensus rules or not.
All that Luke Jr. proposes is that for one particular block, a light wallet does something that a normal full node does anyway, namely downloading the complete block and VERIFYING it (actually only verifying it's size).
That's all. Why is this so difficult to comprehend? It is a very obvious and correct idea.

If, after the fork happens, you want to sell your B2X for fiat or for BTC, then you have to transfer your B2X (not your BTC) to an exchange like Bitfinex.
If you want to sell the B2X future tokens (called "BT2") already NOW (or before the fork happens) at Bitfinex, then you have to transfer your BTC to Bitfinex now, and once it is there you can swap 1 BTC for 1 BT1 and 1 BT2 future token at the exchange (for no fee). Once this has happened, you can sell your BT2 token and get BT1 tokens for it. Now you have to keep all your BT1 tokens at Bitfinex until the HF happens. Then Bitfinex will convert all your BT1 tokens to BTC tokens, and then you can withdraw them again to your private wallet.

They want some other changes first to make bitcoin more efficient. SegWit was one step, and its usage is already &gt;13% now, so capa increase is de facto in action already!
Meanwhile, other improvements like schnorr are on the roadmap, also bringing more TX per Mbyte into the protocol.
Also LN is in development and sidechains, this will further offload the main chain.
So we can see how this plays out. increasing blocksize prematurely causes decentralizazion problems. So the order of steps is important. no hurry to increase. In the long term, of course base blocksize increase is needed, but then well prepared and with consensus of community. The idea than is to not only include base increase, but also other improvements into the HF, such that there is only one HF, and not many, which would disturb unnecessarily.

Yes that is malicious. But which of these points above apply to Berry Silbert personally? Link/proof?
These malicious things are the deeds of true bitcoin enemies.


Yes, s2x meeting was closed door meeting. but at that time the fight was about segwit, and without that we'd have no segwit today or a paining uasf split with unknown outcome. That meeting has prevented that to happen.
In the meantime, BCH popped up (also unpredictable at that time) as a result of another malicious actor in the Bitcoin space.
In my view, given that BCH exists today, every NYA signer should be able to withdraw without being called breaking a contract. This is what Berry should tweet.

Where did you learn math? An avg. bitcoin block has ca. 4000 transaction. With 6 blocks per hour that's 24,000 tx/h or 1.15 Millon TX in 48 hours.
20% of 1.15 Million is 230 thousand, which is, well, not quite zero.   
@_date: 2017-10-07 08:16:52


if btc becomes the cheaper coin (unlikely), and if some few miners still mine it, very likely we'll see oscillations of block time and profitability, very similarly to bch nowadays. this comes by the nature of the adjustment mechanisms. think through it. if only a small minority mines low-profitable btc, it will be very profitable after 1 or 2 difficulty adjustments. then all rational miners will join after it is so profitable. then next diff. adj'mnt it will become highly unprofitable again and only few idealistic miners remain. As a result, this oscillation pattern would continue endlessly as long as the coin is valued less than the competing sha256 coin. The periods of high profitability and low difficulty and low blocktime and high TX capa will last for &lt;&lt; 14 days, whereas the periods of high difficulty, high blocktimes, low profitability and low TX capa will last much much longer than 14 days. I dare to predict that such a coin won't make it long without a HF to eleminate such characteristics. Of course I think it is MUCH more likely that B2X rather than BTC will be hit by this destiny.


of course nothing gets stolen.

You are making it hard for me not to put you on my "ignore" list...
@_date: 2017-09-03 01:03:40
In such conditions the main alts usually act as "amplifiers" of bitcoin. I.e. if bitcoin drops a little, the alts drop a little more (in percent).
You should have cashed out to fiat (temporarily) if you had anticipated the $5000 pullback.
I agree it could (conjunctive, not past tense) have been expected that $5000 is a significant psychological barrier and pullbacks could be anticipated. However, even that is not granted. There are counter examples. E.g. around 20th May 2017, the $2000 "barrier" was no barrier at all. The market simply breezed over it and completely ignored that alleged "psychological barrier". Everyone who sold around 19-21 May this year near $2000 ran into a bear trap. (It shortly returned to sub $2000 later on 16 June, but that is another story).
So people convinced of the long-term prospects should better hodl than sell in expectation of a psychological barrier - because otherwise they run danger of getting fooled by the market.

Oh, I did not remember that. Yes, probably it was more a miners' "safe face" negotiation with Charly, because LTC will anyway not hit its TX limit for the next 5 years or so. And if it does, techology will have evolved and Charly can roll out a well planned and well accepted HF with a small block size increase well in advance with ample preparation time and flag-day activation in a non-contentious way.

Welcome to Bitcoin! And good luck in finding the right technical arguments, and resist the populist haters' propaganda that is mixed with propaganda of malicious elements.
Bitcoin Cash people from r/btc think they can scale by solely increasing the blocksize as demand grows. And they think they are right because their transactions on bitcoin cash network currently confirm fast (provided they do not suffer long block times, which is a bug in the EDA algo of bitcoin cash that happens regularly, but this is an entirely separate subject...). However, the truth is that hardly anybody USES bitcoin cash today, and hence blocks are not full at all. This is how Bitcoin was some years ago and almost all altcoins are still today! When you have little usage, you have of course no capacity problem.
For the long-term, they honestly think that on-chain scaling (i.e. block size increase alone) can compensate. They are not visionary and cannot even think two steps ahead. But if they just thought a few steps further, they would understand that their way of thinking leads nowhere. We need a highly decentralized Bicoin bockchain (referred to as "layer 1" network, i.e. the backbone, the underlying transaction network), which is only possible if blocks are small enough relative to technological state and evolution. The scaling then has to happen on other layers ("layer 2") on top of that layer 1. If we just scale on layer 1, we have a centralized network to begin with and have hence a broken Bitcoin.
Andreas Antonopulous, one of the most respected and knowledgeable Bitcoin experts in the universe, gives a good explanation about this in this latest video, **which I highly recommend to watch**:  (30 well invested minutes)
The r/btc people would only watch till 1:55 min and then think their stance is confirmed, and then they offer a simple "populist" solution (sometimes mixed with pseudo-science) by simple blocksize increase. But when you keep on watching after 1:55 in, you'll see how this viewpoint is falling apart.
There are two sorts of people: First, people that want hard facts and that critically ask questions and strive for the best solutions and trade-offs in a non-perfect world. And secondly, people that want perfect simple solutions in denial of unwelcome truths, prone to populist propaganda mixed with conspiracies, they tell you what you want to hear and that simple solutions do exist to even most complex problems and that another evil group (rather than technical circumstances and laws of physic) is to be blamed for any problems that exist.
If you belong to the first group of people, you'll find your home at r/bitcoin. If you belong to the second group of people, you are having an IQ &lt; 90, you are receptive for religious ideologies, zero-energy machines, you believe in self-proclaimed experts without being able to wrap your own head around complex matters, are receptive to alien and other conspiracy theories, right-wing propaganda, and you'll likely get caught by the tempting simple solutions offered to you in r/btc.

We need an ecologically sustainable world society in the future that does not deplete the planet's resources the way it does today. What you describe would help, as it would disincentivise the spending for useless stuff. The necessities and really desired goods and services are still being purchased - otherwise nobody today would buy computers or TVs or smartphones - all of which are highly(!) deflationary (and these industries are not the ones suffering most!). This also proves that the mechanisms you are describing are just a theory, a very incomplete and erroneous economical model, proven wrong by reality. The crisis of the 20ies was not caused by a non-inflationary currency. stable currencies on the contrary were the basis of long and stable economical periods in history, both in America and Europe, over decades and centuries. But the banking cartels like to promote the story and "reasoning" that you describe and that is still mainstream, instead of being taught as one (questionable!) economical model amongst many economical models.
Apart from that, nobody really believes that Bitcoin can or will be the only and primary currency, but that was mentioned already in other replies.

this was explained 1000 times. were you sleeping? Firstly it creates a monopoly by pushing other miners off the market due to vastly different profitability and possibility to reinvest profits into further mining equipment.

in a very negative way, if miners mine B2X at a loss for some longer period, thereby carrying out an open attack against Bitcoin.
in a very positive way, if miners choose to mine the more profitable legacy chain and B2X dies off quickly.

I explained it 3 weeks ago.
in short: confirmation time increases, the coin with lower market value amongst them will be less profitable to mine for several weeks. if miners are economically rational, the less valued coin (most likely s2x) will die quickly.
if miners are ideological and keep the lower valued coin alive by mining at a loss, both coins can coexist.

You don't need to wait. BCH already exists, everyone is free to use its 8MB capacity.
As to bitcoin core, more efficiency improvements are on the roadmap, incl. schnorr signatures, increasing TX/s capacity further without blocksize increase.
Moreover Lightning and sidechains are in the making. All this will take load off bitcoin blockchain's Layer 1 and give more time for an on-chain capacity hardfork (which eventually has to come, no doubt).
One has to see the system as a whole, and not restrict to monocausal views. Unfortunately, many people just can see single factors in isolation and then become very impatient and angry for the wrong reasons.

Instead of throwing 30.000 premined coins into their throats and making these scammers all millionairs, better support the original ASIC-resistant people's coin, and that is, in the best spirit of Bitcoin, you name it: Vertcoin (VTC), which is rightfully called the "people's coin".
Vertcoin is not a pump. They want a sustainable coin and are not interested in short term pumping. That is why it is valued so little still. Bad marketing. Just like Monero did bad marketing for a very long time. I am just convinced of Vertcoin's honest concept. The sustainable concepts prevail in the long term. That's why I am long in Bitcoin, Monero and Vertcoin, and wait for the demise of BCash and Bitcoin Gold. I always was a bad and untalented day trader. But I had a good nose (and comprehension) of visions and long-term trends. I trust myself more than anyone else.

Yes, but this has nothing to do with Bitcoin. In a real world casino, if you train your eyes and brain to recognize the initial state of a roulette wheel (position and speed of the ball and position and speed of the wheel), you can predict the outcome in a statistically significant way, and make a gain by e.g. always betting on that 25% of the numbers that are lying in the sector of the wheel where the ball is most likely to stop.
It is questionable whether the human brain is capable of doing this. With technical equipment it is well possible, but this is forbidden in all casinos.

ok ok. I just have a different definition of the word "exploit".
If an economicaly rational miner switches from BTC to BCH chain at time periods where BCH blocks are mined quickly and cheaply, I wouldn't call that "exploit". I'd call this normal and fully legitimate(!) behaviour. In my language an exploit cannot be legitimate.
Maybe my language is wrong. Anyway, it's jsut a matter of definition of terms/language, not content :-)

But bip39 is industry standard, and it is a hassle if it is not compatible. At least it would be nice if Electrum supported bip39 as an option. Or is there a severe security issue with bip39 that the whole industry is ignoring??

not all eggs, but 3-10% of savings should be a decent strategy.
*edit: clarification: 3-10% are not to be taken literally, but as a point of orientation. It depends on risk willingness and age, for example. E.g. a conservative investor at retirement age should select 0%, whereas a risk-aware 20 or 30 year old could put 10% or even 15% of his savings into Bitcoin. Someone who follows the scene closely and understands the technology and the socio-economical implications worldwide could invest more in tendency (if his judgement gets her/him to justify such a decision), while someone not understanding Bitcoin and just looks at the chart should be very cautious unless s/he has VERY good close and fully trustable friends belonging to the first group.*

Why avgBlockTime=9.4 and not 10 (minutes)?
Because difficulty adjustment is lagging behind the ever increasing hash rate. As a consequence, actual average block time since inception is approx. 9.4 minutes.

This is funny. You are like the r/btc shills. Not good.
There are all good arguments for BTC and why the BCH concept is not sustainable.
But if you use lies to "argument" against BCH, you make yourself ridiculous and let the proper arguments appear bad.
And where, please, do I make "propaganda"?!??? I am just stating some facts, providing some interesting information. BCH is a fact, and you won't get rid of it anyway, no matter how much you rant and lie. So let the kids play with BCH while we do the real thing with BTC. Lying and being defamatory is always counter-productive. If you lack the technical arguments, the best service you can do to BTC is to be silent and listen to others who do have the technical arguments pro BTC - because these arguments are there! But don't "imitate" the bad character of r/btc, please!

When thinking through it, we see that that would entail endless oscillations between long (probably several weeks or montslhs) periods of low profitability and long block times, and then again few-day-periods of high throughput by low difficulty. Such situation isn't healthy/viable in the long run. Bcore people know it, and some of them (not all as a closed group) would take consequences.

Most people here misinterpret this graph due to wishful thinking.
Actually it shows that current recovery is too fast, too early. Expect new lows in the current bear market. We are currently in a bull trap - comparable to the period "180-280 days" of the green graph!
Remember that time scales increase in each periodic bubble. Bitcoin follows a "linear looking" growth not on a log chart, but on a double-log-chart.
It will take about 2400 days to regain last ATH levels (after ca. 600 and 1200 days the last times), i.e. expect the level of $20,000 not before around July 2024! Expect substantial lows around April 2021.
Yes you read correctly. New ATHs not for the 2020 halving, but one halving later!

define "core team".
a team of &gt;100 unorganized developers? how can they "want" something? Is it bad to have bitcoin driven by such a diverse team of experts, and better have open&amp;free Bitcoin hijacked by an industry cartel (this is what segwit2x is!)?


It is, because it means an industry cartel coerces bitcoin protocol changes on the users. We must resist and fight this!


That's why core team is continuously improving and updating the sw and protocols with security and scaling solutions. E.g. they delivered Segwit, which was blocked for a long time by the same players now leading the s2x industry cartel.


No other altcoin has the traffic of bitcoin, so they have no scaling problem. if you don't see this triviality, you don't qualify for ANY discussion on the matter.

I think you misunderstood the social contract. it is not about an arbitrary change if something doesn't go the way we want. It is a dedicated change of mining algo, and only this, and it is part of vertcoin's social contract today.
One could even "formalize" such change by defining rules and criteria to change to a new algo, that algo being a function of the coin's random hash values. I tried to suggest this, but at the moment Vertcoiners consider such an approach an unnecessary overkill, I think.

I think we need proactive fixes in the sense of protocol improvement as enablers for future evolutions. SegWit was such a necessary fix.

there's nothin like "human time consensus" in bitcoin (apparently you just invented that term out of lack of knowledge).
The difficulty adjustment is based on the [timestamps included in the blocks](


I can prove your statement wrong by a counter example: *"A transaction with nLockTime set cannot be spent (or even put on the block chain) until either the blockheight or time is reached."*
So next time please think or google first before submitting a "zero knowledge proof" of the other kind within 30 seconds.

Again a fallacy, my head aches by reading so much naivity, sorry.
Did you hear of difficulty adjustment mechanism, ever?
If mining is 2 times more energy efficient, NOTHING changes. Because not only you, but also all other competing miners will pay 50% of electricity per hash compared to before. As a result, hash rate goes up and difficulty increases. The new equilibrium leaves you with the exact same mining profit as before. And the same electricity usage.

I respectfully disagree with almost everything you are writing here - nothing is well thought-through at all, I am afraid to say.


This argument has been repeated 1000 times and is still wrong.
The word "bit" existed long before computers or even transistors were invented. **"Bit" describes a small quantity of something**.
Then computers were invented, and the word "bit" was re-used to describe a small quantity of digital information. It was so successful because it is a short and simple word - a no brainer. Nobody complained that the computer bit would get confused with other "bits", like e.g. the small replaceable elements of screwdrivers (yes, also they too are called "bits").
So it just natural to call a small quantity of the leading digital currency "bit" as well, especially if the digital currency is called *Bit*coin.
Saying it might be confused with the bits from the computer unit is outright ridiculous, because it is a whole different context.


No, it is measured in "megabits per second", you don't even knwo the basics in units and disqualify yourself embarrassingly.


I measure it in EUR per standard transaction (1 input, two outputs), but feel free to use satoshi per byte.


Your argument makes maximum zero sense. In fact it makes a negative amount of sense! Then you also have to explain people why they have a huge number of small pieces a a screwdriver in  the PC, smartphone or memory stick. Good luck with that.

I think markets will value the long term value proposition of Bitcoin as a truely decentralized coin. I expect that temporarily longer confirmation times/lower capacity in bitcoin enforced by miners mining b2x instead at a loss cannot fool the markets. On the contrary, markets will know that miners attack bitcoin in an attempt to take over control and destroy the decentralized nature. So bitcoin price will remain higher than bitcoin2x price. After a while some b2x miners will give up and mine bitcoin again. That's when the tide turns. Then b2x chain will die andn miners having formerly mined b2x lose everything.
In the unlikely case that markets get fooled (or manipulated by deep pockets) and b2x chain gets valued higher and all miners leave bitcoin, bitcoin will hardfork with POW change and regain traction. This part of the revenues will be lost for today's ASIC miners forever then.
Miners know this today already and will behave in an egoistic way, not risking loss of long term revenues.

Trough the history of Bitcoin, I remember only one evil miner, and that is Jihan Wu.
People tend to forget, but I cannot forget how he put (and still does) his own interests above Bitcoin's needed evolution and sustainability with his AsicBoost and all the drama that derived from it (incl. trying blocking segwit).
He gives a fuck on Bitcoin's long term success, he is just trying to maximize his personal wealth, and he won't change. I will never forget and always see all his words and deeds as part of his personal strategy to increase own wealth in complete ignorance of Bitcoin's success.
Edit: That being said, I think Bitcoin Pow change now would create chaos and would be very bad for Bitcoin. So I may agree with Jihan on this point (albeit for entirely different reason), but this does not diminish my strong reservations against this toxic element whatsoever.

Fallacy! Because: If mining is very profitable, more miners enter the scene quickly, until an equlibrium is reached where mining is only marginally profitable. At this point the network is very secure and an attacker had to spent much money. So the security is always proportional to the mining ~~reward~~ *profits* per hour, irrespective of the mining algorithm.

It *is* going somewhere: Down! That's as obvious today as it was obvious in 2011 that it will at least triple. We'll see 120 USD in 2015, and most likely even double-digit prices. 36000 new mined coins every day (&gt;8 Mill USD every day at current price) is a lot of inflation of bitcoins. Moreover, markets are saturated (all players in the financial world know about Bitcoin in the meantime) and mass adoption won't happen any time soon in lack of value proposition for the *average(!)* user (talking about *mass* adoption).
So the price can only go down: 90-120 USD in 2015, and probably 30-50 USD in 2016 towards the "Cyprus-peak" of 2011 (maybe back to 100 USD upon block reward halving in 2016). THAT is realistic, anything else is dreaming.

If you mean block reward zero - that's not gonna happen in 2140 but a few years earlier, because avg. block time is consistently 9.4 minutes instead of 10 minutes. If it remains like that due to always increasing hash power, we are at zero block reward in year 2132.
But that year won't be anything special anyway!
If bitcoin relies on the block reward, it'll have a problem long time before 2132.
If not because miners earn enough from fees, it won't make a difference if block reward reduces from 1 sat to 0 sat in 2132.

I think it will go through. They urgently need a fix because BCH miners are regularly mining at a loss since 3 months now to subsidise BCH during the high-difficulty periods. With only rational miners, the chain would long have died. I am surprised the DAA change to replace EDA comes so late. They could have just copied Vertcoin's DAA algo or implement an algo that works (like the one they are planning now for 13th Nov).
Now they have chosen a very simple algo amongst a handful of candidates. some independent devs have expressed discontent for not having been asked/informed/considered despite presenting an even better algo. But I think the BCH ppl will agree better having a non-optimum algo now than a perfect one in 2 months. They can anyhow hardfork again if they find an even better algo, since they are not afraid of hardforks and the centralized miner eco-system makes it easy to coerce hardforks. So now they first need to fix the most pressing problem at first.

If you want to learn, I can tell you that it is not a chicken egg problem at all! Don't believe people who say so, They are people who do not understand that sometimes causation does cause correlation, and that you have to check case by case if it does. The prefer general dumb says like "correlation does not imply causation" (which is true) and think it means that same as "correlation is never caused by causation", which is obviously wrong.
Use your own brain instead. Do it this way:


This means rephrased: Hypothesis "A":
***"If coin value increases because of higher demand, the mining cost per coin becomes more expensive as a consequence."***
Does it make sense? Let's check:
Method chosen: Assume the opposite of the hypothesis and check if we can prove the opposite wrong. If yes, the thesis itself makes sense (this is a typical proof method in mathematics).
The counter-hypothesis ("Not A") reads:
*"If coin value increases because of higher demand, the mining cost per coin does NOT become more expensive as a consequence."*
This means, the mining difficulty remains the same, because miner hash rate remains the same. Some people who did not mine before because it was unprofitable (e.g. because of too high electricity costs) could mine now at a profit, but they do not do so because they do not want to make money.
Obviously, this makes no sense! Economically rationale miners would of course switch on their miners to make a profit. This will increase global hash power. This increases mining difficulty. This increases the electricity cost per mined coin.
Conclusion: Hypothesis A makes absolute sense and is an economical necessity, an automatism, in any economically rationale market.


This means rephrased: Hypothesis "B":
***"If the mining cost per coin becomes more expensive, coin value will increase as a consequence."***
Does this make sense? Let's check:
What can be the reason for mining cost per block becoming more expensive? Hmm, one reason can be increased coin value (see first part above), but this reason we are not interested here, because we want to check the opposite direction.
So what else can be the reason for mining cost per coin becoming more expensive? Another reason can be a block reward halving event. At this event, from one moment to the next, mining cost per coin doubles because block reward per block halves. So will this make the price increase? Well, it may increase the price long term because of a reduced supply of new coins. But that would mean price increases because of the reduction of supply. But that is not the causal relation that we are looking at here.
So what else may be the reason for mining cost per block getting more expensive? Well, for example an increase in electricity cost. Let's make a thought experiment: Let's assume that all electricity cost all over the world increases by 100%, gradually over the next 100 days!
Will this make the coin value increase? Well, as we know, coin value only increases if the ratio between supply and demand shifts. Why should the demand of coins increase when electricity costs for mining increase? In other words, why should anybody want to own more bitcoins because miners have to pay a higher electricity bill per mined coin? Does bitcoin become more useful? No! So demand will not increase! Also note that the amount of newly mined coins is only a small fraction of the coins trades on the exchange markets. So miners cannot magically "dictate" the prices and say "Gee, I want to have more fiat for my coins, otherwise I won't sell!", because then buyers will simply buy other, cheaper coins and miners keep their coins and cannot pay their electricity bill with fiat. So this is not what miners can do.
What does happen instead when electricity cost increase gradually by 100% is simply that some miners (those who are the least profitable) will stop mining, because if they continued they would mine at a loss. But this will reduce hash rate and hence decrease mining difficulty gradually as electricity costs increase. After 100 days, mining difficulty has decreased so much that a new profitability equilibrium has established for the remaining miners. While some miners have left, others still mine at a profit, thanks to the somewhat reduced difficulty now.
Conclusion: Hypothesis B is bullshit.
I hope this helped. If not, I am afraid you should search for a new hobby, Bitcoin's economic incentives are too complicated for you and you will always be manipulated by others because of your inability to think on your own. That is, "if". But I really encourage you to think through it. About 30% I think (gut estimate) are able to grasp it if they want to.

@_date: 2017-10-02 02:59:28
Market prices of BTC and B2X will form, and hash power of rational miners will adapt accordingly.
E.g. if BTC has 70% of market value and B2X has 30%, then hash power ratio between the two will also be 70:30, because otherwise one coin will be less profitaable to mine than the other, so there is an incentive for miners ot leave the less profitable chain in favour of the profitable one, and equilibrium is reached when ratio of hash power == ration of prices.
If, e.g., one of the two coins receives only 10% of market value, it will take about half a year of very low capacity for that chain before coming up to speed again.
Ideologically blinded Sigwit2X proponents say that 90% of miners signal SegWit2X today, so hashrate will be 90:10 in favour of B2X. But this is short-sighted, because if market value on the exchanges is higher for BTC, then miners would be stupid if they still mined B2X and gave all the high profits to the 10% of miners mining BTC.

@_date: 2017-10-06 22:19:28
you understood the short-term (i.e. until difficulty adjustment) equilibrium well!
To add: An **example**:
Assume 70% of miners mine the more profitable (because more valuable) BTC and 30% of "hostile" miners mine the unprofitable B2X at a loss. ln that case it would take BTC 20 days (14/0.70) and B2X 47 days (14/0.30) until the next difficulty adjustment.
Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that market prices are BTC:B2X = 4:1 and this ratio remains the same.
Now let's see how miner profitability evolves over time:
Days 1-20:
* BTC mining is 4 times more profitable than B2X mining fir each single miner (same difficulty but different sales price).
Days 21-47: Difficulty adjusts (=lowers by factor 0.7) on BTC chain. Hence:
* BTC mining is now even 5.7 times more profitable than B2X mining.
Days 48 ff.: Difficulty adjusts (=lowers by factor 0.3) on B2X chain. Hence: 
* BTC mining is still 1.7 times more profitable than B2X mining.
These are examples. With other values you get different results.
**Example 2**: If the percentage of B2X miners is 20% instead of 30% (such that assumed miner ratio = price ratio), the numbers above change as follows:
* 20 days --&gt; 17.5 days
* 47 days --&gt; **70 days**
* 5.7 times --&gt; 5.0 times
* 1.7 timed --&gt; 1.0 times
* the fewer miners are willing to mine at a loss, the longer it will take them to mine at a huge loss!
* if more miners are willing to mine B2X at a loss, the time of huge loss will be shorter, but after that the mining will remain unprofitable forever (like the factor 1.7 in the first example).
The point is that we have no EDA, as you correctly pointed out, so the equilibrium does not find itself quickly and it is more likely that ACTUALLY the less profitable chain won't be mined at all pretty soon.
Edit: So I see two likely scenarios:
* (a) most likely:    
BTC market price is significantly higher than B2X market price, so B2X chain dies off quickly, and that's it. No HF, no new chain. (maybe S2X die-hards will patch an EDA or a POW change into it, but unlikely this gets accepted on the markets).
* (b) less likely:    
BTC market price is significantly lower than B2X market price, so BTC chain dies off quickly.    
   BTC itself with bitcoin core hard-forks to POW change and continues to exist.    
   Since we end up with two hardforks, both will claim the name bitcoin, and if market price remains consistently higher for one chain, this will likely determine who gets called "Bitcoin".
Edit 2:
--&gt; So due to the step-wise (not continuous) difficulty adjustments, miner incentives get structured in a way that make it highly unlikely that both coins will exist on the long run, if miners are rational. Which raises the side-question:
* Did **Satoshi** foresee this or is it coincidence?
Interestingly, in the 250 BTC deal between **Roger Ver and Charly Lee**, did they (esp. Roger) see through this? It is highly likely that the loser (probably Roger, scenario (a)) ends up with really nothing!

This method is a bit more complicated than the 50% quantile (median) rule, and it also raises the limit to change the max. block size in *either* direction to "80% majority".
On the one hand, I think given how the BIP100 proposal is constructed today (and keeping this construction unchanged), this is not a bad idea, because it would avoid the probability of too hefty yearly changes. Because, as we know, BIP100 mechanisms allow to increase the block size limit by a **factor of 20** or decrease by **-95%** within a **1-year** period.
On the other hand, I think BIP100 should be improved to avoid such high yearly changes in the first place, and then once this is avoided, come back to a 50% quantile rule.

He should tweet something like this:
*My intention with s2x was to keep the community together.*
*S2x gave us segwit and prevented a uasf split with unforeseeable outcome.*
*I, and NYA signers, might have decided otherwise, had we known about the emergence of the other big block fork known as "bitcoin cash"*.
*I can understand if NYA signers withdraw from NYA in the given situation, given that (a) there is another big block chain already known as BCH, and (b) S2X is splitting and threatening more than uniting the Bitcoin community. Both was not foreseeable at time of signature and against intention of serious Bitcoin proponents.*

That's not how it works. If an author releases an idea to the public domain at time t1, he cannot afterwards claim a patent at time t2, if t2 &gt; t1. In that case he has messed it up, the idea is out to the public - done! Not patentable any more!
Too many times I had to hold back an idea from publishing it (or presenting it to a standardization body), because the patent attorneys in my company were not yet ready with sending my patent to the patent office. Exactly for that reason.

I have difficulties to see how the lower-valued B2X can survive more than a few hours, at best a few days. Miners would have to mine at a loss, and this for a VERY long time, because of lack of change in the difficulty adjustment algorithm.
I think they will be smart enough not to do that and the B2X chain is gonna die on the way.
Of course some die-hards may do another hard-fork to modify the difficulty adjustment algorithm as the only step to let it survive. But this will make it even more unaccepted by the community, and Roger will have to think if he still wants to give such an alt-alt-coin the ticker symbol "BTC".

if 79% want the user experience to remain unchanged (tx fees, congestion), if 79% of miners want the ratio of block size limit vs. avg. internet bandwidth and storage capacity unchanged, while 21% prefer the change towards a new user experince with congested mem pool, long confirmation times, users running away from Bitcoin towards paypal or ethereum, and this 21% prefer a continuous reduction (=change) of the ratio of block size vs. internet connection speed (for reasons of ideology, false judgement or personal business interests), ...

It is **MUCH** more negative to try to hide a mistake than to openly admit it an fix it. If it comes out that someone tried to hide the mistake (as is the case here), it comes out VERY NEGATIVE and DESTROYS LOTS OF TRUST!

I am talking about the utc timestamp in bitcoin blocks, not about some time server!
Acc. to Bitcoin protocol since 2009, Bitcoin block UTC timestamp is also safe. Blocks must carry a timestamp within 2h accuracy of real UTC. If a miner violates this, his block will not be accepted by other miners and he wasted money!
So any smart contract contained in a block can refer to the block's block height or to the block's utc time. Both are possible.
Also note that difficulty adjustment of Bitcoin's protocol uses the blocks' UTC time stamp. So the notion that the utc time is irrelevant and only carried in the blocks for information, but not for actual protocol purposes, is untrue. Think about it: without utc timestamp, difficulty retargeting is impossible. So all miners/nodes must use the same utc time source, otherwise (if everyone selected its own time server) the protocol rules (difficulty) would become ambiguous! (but I assume many have this misunderstanding before thinking so deeply into it).
That's also why it sounds logical and consequent to me if LN also had the option to refer to real time rather than block count (ref. back to my original question).

Oooops - this looks like a cascade of dogmatic naive clueless viewpoints of a short-sighted narrow-minded religious dreamer.




Why should a state start a "state-sponsored" crypto-currency? This is a buzzword without clear definition. How do you define "state-sponsored crypto-currency"? In how far is it same/different to bitcoin? For example: Would the state have the power to change the protocol at will (like max. money cap, black-listing addresses)? Would the block-confirmation be done by decentralized non-state-controlled miners? Would the state still have the power to overrule and not accept some otherwise regularly mined blocks?  
After you have defined all this in detail, please explain in detail why it would still be of interest for a state to issue such a "crypto-currency". Otherwise, this talk about state-sponsored crypto-currencies is just nonsense.
Did you think of this yourself, or are you just writing it because the idea of state-issued crypto-currencies have been expressed and re-iterated so often elsewhere, and since it was re-iterated so often, it must be a good idea?


Please define "crash". Note that some people say it has crashed already, some say the crash was 1971 when the gold standards was ended, others say it's a continuous crash because it has lost &gt;90% (99%?) of value over the  last 100 years, while yet others say because this is so continuous, it is not actually a crash, and since the devaluation will continue to be gradually, there will never be something like a "crash" (= *sudden* drop in value) of the USD. So please specify how you define "crash of the USD", by measurable terms. As an example, personally I would define "crash" as a loss of value by more than 50% in one year in comparison to average currency basket like "SDR w/o USD", or in comparison to GDP of USA, i.e. a USD dollar crash would mean that the US GDP, measured in USD, would increase by &gt;100% in one year. According to that definition, I tend to believe that there will never be a crash of the USD, because it will continue to devaluate just gradually and not suddenly. If you think otherwise, please elaborate why, and how exactly *you* define "crash".


No, not at all. If every person on earth adopted Bitcoin today, the Bitcoin capacity would be just enough such that every person on earth could perform one Bitcoin transaction once every 100 years! On average! That's today's technical limitation of the Bitcoin protocol! So Bitcoin yet needs to scale. Also the long-term stability of the network, as block reward decreases, yet has to be proven. Will the POW mechanism suffice? OR will we need other layers of protection, like net of trust, to avoid 51% attacks in the future? This is a very technical question yet unsolved. So the technological portion of Bitcoin is not done at all. I am not saying it is unsolvable, but saying that nothing needs to be done anymore just reflects a very superficial view of the matter.


You better educate yourself first and first get your thoughts (like definitions of terms) clear.

20% quantile as the value for the vote is a horrible idea. Making the system weak against 20% minority attacks completely unnecessarily!
Anything other than taking the 50% (median) is bad system design.
With "median", the threshold for attack (no matter if "up" or "down"-voting the block size limit) is raised to 50%.
Designing a 20% value instead of 50% means that it is considered upfront more likely (forever!) that there is (and always will be) a majority of bad actors who wants to pull the max block size in one direction, than in the other.
Whoever wants to have a 20% limit for the vote, either did not think properly, or is fully aware of this and wants to manipulate the max blocksize in one direction.

The notion that a "80% rule" (20% quantile) give more stability than a 50% rule (median) is a fallacy. In fact, the opposite is true. For any quantile other than 50%, a minority can force the vote in one direction.
The mentioned fallacy comes from "intuitive thinking", but when deeply thinking about it, it gets clear that it isn't true.

In this case I suppose you have mistyped the password when making the backup, you have written down the password that you THOUGHT you had used, but you actually used another password. I know this from myself: On the small smartphone screen I often mistype u for i or i for o almost systematically, so it is very likely that, when I type in the same password twice, I do the same error twice. Later, I won't be able to recover the backup.
This is a normal human error.
The only wallet that avoids even this kind of human error is the backup concept of Mycelium wallet: They force you to VALIDATE the password that you have just written down for your backup, and only if that validation is successful, the Mycelium wallet app considers the Backup to be successful, and only then it will remove the warning "no backup" to be displayed. Moreover, Mycelium does not let the user decide the password but uses a 12-word-list (BIP39), which even avoids the mistyping problem I described above.
**I urge Copay and all other wallet app makers to follow the same philosophy as Mycelium of forcing (!) the user to validate the own backup before the "no backup" warning disappears.** Even though this may appear annoying to the user, it is definitely for their own good. And it is a one-time action only. Also, BIP39 should be the standard instead of self-chosen passwords. Note that a self-chosen password can still be combined with BIP-39 acc. to the standard (not supported by Mycelium for backup I think [but supported for recovery]).
It takes time until all wallets follow these best industry practices. At the moment, Mycelium is clearly the reference.

You may call it illegitimate or immoral. You may even question if it is counter constitution in some countries like the US.
But calling central banks generally and world-wide "illegal" is ridiculous.

@_date: 2015-09-06 18:03:02
Exactly, very well said!
With this BIP100 being implemented and deployed, there can be a 21% minority dragging the block size limit down by the means offered in BIP100 protocol, while a 51% majority may try to "self-defend" their legitimate needs by not accepting those miner's blocks with their hashing power majority, since this would be the only way to defend against such a 21% minority attack.
However, in the "language" and perception of the bitcoin protocol (which then incorporates BIP100), such legitimate behaviour of those 51% to 79% of miners mitght be perceived by the community as a 51% attack against the Bitcoin (incl. BIP100) protocol, because these 21% of blocks are actually valid from protocol definition point of view, and they are rejected by this 51%..79% majority (even though in an act of "self-defense").
Now I do not even want to think this scenario further.. what will we be up to?
--&gt; As a consequence, there will be lots of controversy taking place: One camp will blame the other of a 21% attack trying to cripple Bitcoin for ideological or other reasons by dragging down the block size limit, while the 21% minority plus Bitcoin purists who don'T see what is happening here will accuse the &gt;51% majority of performing an evil 51% attack against those poor and helpless 21% minority of legitimate miners who don't get their blocks accepted although these blocks are fully valid and protocol-compliant!
I don't want to see this to happen in the future! It has the potential of harm the Bitcoin network even more than what the current controversial block size limit debate does!!
To avoid this controversy, the only thing that the 51%..79% majority could do in the presence of such a 21% attack is to "surrender" (in anticipation of those 51% attack accusation that would otherwise occur) and let the block size limit decrease below limits necessary (acc. to vast majority's opinion). This appears crazy!
Hence, please do not implement this one-sided biased 20% quantile rule into BIP100, since this has the potential to destroy Bitcoin. Instead, please let's find a better way like for example
* Make it 50% instead of 20%, implying the same security against legacy 51% attack and 51% vote attack - this would inherently avoid above mentioned controversy or misuse, which would be very harmful to Bitcoin!
* Require the **same** (80% or whatever) majority to increase or decrease block size (but this still gives a minority the power to block any necessary change and would still ahve the danger of above mentioned misuse and 51% controversy, so even this is not a good solution - at least the 20% blocking "veto" threshold is too low - would need to change to 40% veto blocking power or so at least (=60% majority instead of 80%)!)
* Amend the whole voting procedure by introducing other rules on top of some simple BIP100-like (e.g. 51%) voting rules, to to avoid misuse and too fast and unpredictable change of block size limit.

This is good to finally know what Jeff meant.
It shows that Jeff did not think it through thoroughly. Because, clearly, if you base your voting on the 20% quantile, then it is completely superfluous to first remove the TOP 20% of the vote. That part of BIP100 serves no mathematical purpose.
Because a 20% quantile is defined as the value X as follows:
"X is the smallest value, which satisfies the condition that "20% of all votes are smaller than X".

That's a quite biased interpretation of "sideways", as it only considers the lower bound (resistance) and not the upper one.
But the upper bound of the channel it getting lower and lower since months, so I cannot call it "sideways".
Let's assume that the upper resistance is holding, price does not manage to exceed $10000, but the lower points increase from 1000 to 2000 to 3000 etc. Then with the same argument one would also have to call this "sideways", which would be equally biased, as it would in fact denote an up-movement.
But also the notion that the lower bound is still the same is not true!
In February 2018 their was a low of $5921 at one moment, but on the same day the daily weighted average was no lower than 6870. And this was the lowest daily weighted average! The day before it was $7352, and aside from these two days the daily weighted averages were always in the $8000 region or even higher!
Compare this to the current situation! Daily weighted average is below $7k since more than a month now, and daily weighted averages are even further falling! Don't look at short spikes (be it up or down), they are meaningless as they came with little market volume and hence cannot cause any technical resistance and can at best have a weak psychological effect.
Fact is: We are in a real downtrend since months, the claim we are in a sideway channel is wishful thinking, and we will no doubt fall below 6k and then see sustainable (i.e. not only short spikes) new lows for this year very soon.

Sell all BT2 tokens (=B2X futures) at Bitfinex before the HF B2X happens (for this you have to transfer your BTCs to Bitfinex first, of course).
After the HF day, B2X will be valued so little that all miners will soon leave, letting B2X die and make its value go to zero within hours.
So if you wait till the HF day, it is probably already too late.

I wanted to say (was probably unclear) that the security comes not from the fact that there are so many hashes, but form the fact that it is EXPENSIVE to calculate so many hashes. And the reason it is so expensive is because mining revenues are so high, such that the equilibrium between cost and revenues causes a high hashrate.
So the security is the result of the revenues per day, and the hashrate (i.e. mining difficulty) is just the result of that.
I think this should be normaly clear. But some people think hashrate itself causes security. These people think for example that Litecoin is less secure because it has less hashes, which is nonsense. The mining algo is different, so the same number of hashes costs more in Litecoin than in Bitcoin, so for the same security Litecoin would have less hashes.
Maybe all this is clear to you, in this case, just ignore this comment and sorry for the (possibly unnecessary) confusion.

If the proposal was to check for a certain block hash, it would. But the actual proposal is to download the block and check if it follows bitcoin consensus rules w.r.t. block size being &lt;= 1 MB. So it is not a HF to the slightest. On the contrary it is normal block validation - what all Bitcoin full nodes do since 3rd January 2009.

The word "bit" means a lot already:
It is a unit of information, the name of a German beer, the name of a tool for mechanics, the expression for "small quantity" in English language, ...
So there's no reason not to give it another meaning in a new context. There is no danger of confusion because it is clear from the context what "bit" is meant.
There are many other words, in most (if not all) languages, that have entirely different meanings in different contexts.
Saying that a Bitcoin sub-unit should not be called "bits" because the term is already taken as the base unit for information is so narrow-minded that it hurts. Calling it moronic hurts even more.
Having said that, it should be noted that "bits" is already widely used as 0.000001 BTC = 100 satoshis, which the OP is probably not aware of. Redefining it to "1satoshi" is not needed and would cause unnecessary confusion.

I fully agree with you on this conservative approach for change, but I have a different perception of what the word "change" means in this context:
If the blsz limit remains unchanged while the tx traffic hits the limit and causes congestion and increases tx fees etc., then it is not accurate to say "nothing changes".
I think, if this happens, it would mean MUCH less of a change if the limit had just increased a little (in pace with technology progress) thereby keeping congestion and tx fee levels constant (=unchanged).
I think that this means that a lot changes when tx traffic hits the limit, and you need a huge 80% majority to keep things "unchanged" (in the sense I explained above).
Do you understand my point of view?

After it has been clarified that the "unless" should be an "if", i.e. it explicitly *is* allowed to make new proposals, here it is. The proposal consists of two parts:
**1)** Introduce a block size limit default growth rate of [tbd]% p.a. (e.g. 17 or 30 or 41%) similar to BIP101 and unlike BIP100 (whose default is 0% p.a.). It could be realized by a small percentage step increment every 2 weeks (2016 blocks).
**2)** Introduce a miner voting mechanism similar to (but generalized over) BIP100 which allows to realize a growth (or decline) rate of block size limit that deviates from the default rate (like BIP100). The larger the voting majority, the more the max. deviation can be. An example is given in the second part ("appendix") of [this post]( actual parameterization is t.b.d.
Clearly, depending on how this scheme gets parameterized, it can be either identical to BIP100 or to BIP101. So neither pure BIP100 nor pure BIP101 advocates can seriously be against this proposal, they can only have different opinions on the best parameters.
I propose a parameterization that is "intermediate" between BIP 100 and 101, similar to the example in above linked post.

The internet of things (IoT) is referring to a future vision related to 5G mobile telecommunications technology. Many "things", like environmental sensors, cameras, cars, fridges, or other machines, are connected to the internet. So each of them has a data connection, and each of these "internet-connected things" have to be registered with a telecom operator to be able to use the 5G communication network. If the "thing" wants to pay for something, it could use the same bank account that is registered for its 5G data connection, so no Bitcoin needed for this.
However, some 5G network devices may not communicate with the central base stations, but with each other (D2D = device to device communication) as part of the 5G (or even 4G LTE advanced) concept. Here Bitcoin could come into play: A device which is not registered with any operator might still participate, but to participate it might need to pay bitcoin to other devices for its data to be conveyed. A private houshold could offer to sell electricity to cars parking in front of their private charging station. Payment can be pseudo-anonymously via bitcoin. Other use-cases...?
Problem with this: The Bitcoin network capacity is much too low at present (1 MB max. block size). It can serve only 7 Billion transactions per 100 years currently, which is not enough if, as envisioned, there will be about 10 Billion IoT devices worldwide connected in a 5G network. Even if only 1 out of 100 of these uses Bitcoin, it could make only one Bitcoin payment per year and the Bitcoin network would be exhausted. So Bitcoin network has to scale up a lot for this to work.
After all, it is questionable at present whether or not Bitcoin and IoT will make a useful combination one day.

Merit of BIP101: Growth with technology and usage.
Drawback of BIP101: Growth might be too fast or too slow because schedule is predefined upfront.
Merit of BIP100: Block size limit can adapt adaptively with unforeseen evolution of the environment/technology/ecosystem.
Drawback of BIP100: it is biased by favoring "no change", which can be enforced by a 21% minority, which may encourage further future hardforks to unlock a blockage.
A solution to combine merits and eliminate drawbacks of both is availble, but unfortunately not allowed to be explained and discussed here, which is a pitty (please moderator correct me if I misunderstood):

If 21% of the miners think their revenues are endangered by a higher limit, due to destroying the fee market, and don't see that lower fees improve usability, attractiveness, number of transactions, bitcoin price to offset this effect, then this 21% opinion determines what will happen.
ps: actually less than 21%, because non-votes are treated like votes for "no change"
*edit: to clarify: different people and different miners do and will have different opinions on what is best for bitcoin and for miner revenues. some think fee market is important and too high limit destroys it, others think low tx fees are important for wide adoption and btc price increase (avoiding ppl moving to other solutions/other coins). I think both opinions are EQUALLY respectable, nobody knows upfront what the truth is (although ppl on both side claim so sometimes). So the protocol should not weight one opinion 4 times stronger than the other opinion, as BIP100 does with its 20%/80% rule.*

I am afraid this BIP looks quite "unfinished" and not very well thought through - here my three reasons why:
**(1)** Why are there two "proposals" within this one BIP, which it calls "solutions"? I thought a BIP is supposed to give a clear overall solution, isn't it? Quote from BIP-0001 general guideline on BIPs: *"The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Bitcoin platforms"*
This "BIP106" is much too vague. It is not clear what BIP106 wants. Does it want either "proposal 1" or "proposal 2" within this "BIP106" to be implemented? Or does it propose to combine both proposals? If yes, in what way??
**(2)** About "proposal 1" within this BIP: I think the concrete idea is not well thought through. Waiting until 50% of blocks are more than 90% filled before increasing the block size limit appears arbitrary to me, and a bit too late, the network would already show significant signs of congestion at that point. And then, when MaxBlockSize gets adapted, it is immediately doubled - i.e. first waiting very long doing nothing, and then doubling it in one step. Such big adjustments steps are unhealthy and not stable.
Even worse is the condition for reducing block size: If &gt;90% are less then 50% filled, MaxBlockSizeLimit is halfed. This again is a much too large adaptation step and can cause huge congestions immediately. Example: If 90% are filled by 49% and 10% of blocks are filled 100%, then average blocks are filled by 54.1%. This BIP would HALF the MaxBlockSize limit under such situation, thereby immediately causing a system breakdown for the next two weeks! This does not look like a good design to me.
Moreover, it is not clear why only 2000 out of 2016 blocks are considered, i.e. why systematically 16 out of 2016 blocks arbitrarily are not considered at all.
**(3)** About "proposal 2" within this BIP: In my own words, this proposal says:
If last 4016 blocks are &gt;50% filled AND if both TX fees and the actual block sizes have increased within the last 4016 blocks (by comparing 1st with 2nd part of these 4016 blocks), then MaxBlockSize gets increased by a factor that is the ratio of the actual block sizes of the two parts of the last 4016 blocks.
If last 4016 blocks are &lt;50% filled AND if both TX fees and the actual block sizes have decreased within the last 4016 blocks (by comparing 1st with 2nd part of these 4016 blocks), then MaxBlockSize gets decreased by a factor that is the ratio of the actual block sizes of the two parts of the last 4016 blocks.
This scheme is somewhat interesting, but not well thought through. One point of criticism is that it leaves a crucial component out of the equation, namely the BTC exchange rate. The question how TX fees have changed from one 2008-bocks period to the next 2008-blocks period is not only given by measuring the TX fees in BTC units. If BTC exchange rate has changed in the meantime, the actual fees may have changed despite being nominally the same when measured in BTC units.
Secondly, the criteria for increasing and decreasing are quite arbitrarily mixed together and do not make much sense. Under the given rules one could well construct a scenario where TX fees and actual block size increase monotonically over many weeks, but the criterion for increasing MaxBlockSize limit is not met, because never all of the 3 conditions are met simultaneously. The same holds for the MaxBlockSize decrease condition. I.e., the question whether a MaxBlock Size cap is raised or decreased does not depend on the actual state of the system, but on HOW it arrived there. This is a bad and intransparent system design where the Bitcoin system could run into all kinds of strange and undesireable states.
Finally, again, it is unclear why arbitrarily the last 16 out of 2*2016=4032 blocks are not considered at all.
Total summary: This BIP106 is an agglomerate of unconventional ideas, but they are put together in a way in which it cannot work properly.

By selecting "no to s2x", by NO way do you imply that you don't want to increase blocksize, EVER". Every core dev concedes that in some point in the future an increase is needed and the current block size is too small for a future main stream adoption. But that time is not now.

So you have millions of individual judges deciding for/against other peoples lifes. So everybody will end up killing everyone. Civil war is the result, because if you kill a politician due to YOUR judgement and another person judges your killing unjustified, you will be killed yourself. Etc.

Well, if this is so I am in fact not up to date. Thanks for the hint.
However, while I understood the working principle of the "old" payment channel mechanism (that LN was based on), I am now having troubles understanding how such LN or payment channel can work without a definite timeout.
I understand the user opens a PC (paym.chn.) via one special TX on-chain.   After that, off-chain signed TXs are exchanged back and forth between the parties. What if the other side does not cooperate? My funds will be stuck forever, no?    
Example: I bring in 10mBTC into the PC opening TX. I never make an offchain payment on this PC. After 2 months or so I just want my 10mBTC back. In the "old" PC this happened automatically after timeout. But now w/o timeout, it seems I am screwed. What am I missing?

Thanks for the details. I definitely learned something.
About the facror 2 vs 1.7:
I understand the factor 2 applies to LN-like multisig TXs which on a non-segwit network would be greater than today's avg. Tx, leving less than 3 tps. So the space saving of factor 2 is relative to multisig TXs today, not relative to today's TX mix. against today's tx mix a factor 1.7 would apply, right? (anyway, this impact your calculations only slightly).

nobody would. but that's not the point of the issue. the discussion is about another issue.




The arguments of that paper stand for themself - ignoring them by shouting "political" doesn't make them go away.
I'd say if any political motivation, the authors help improving and securing bitcoin long-term! Because once the issue is recognized, counter measures can be taken (also politically uncritical ones, as discussed elsewhere in this thread). Doing nothing despite knowing better would endanger Bitcoin. So an outside observer would consider your kind of answer as suitable for politically harming Bitcoin.
But you did not understand the main point of the paper yet (see above), hence your wrong inference.

I fully agree.
But after thinking further, I think the main advantage of a sf is that it is not possible for a minority (&lt;50%) of hash power to split the network. It would require a majority (&gt;50%) of hash power of "old nodes" to split the network.
Conversely, for a hf, technically, any minority of hash power of "old nodes" could split the network.
That's what it comes down to, but it seems b-core lack some didactical skills to make things clear to the wider public.

I do not want a coin that hardforks all the time! Hardfork is not a value in itself!
All I am saying is hardfork does not harm, if it makes sense. And I see no argument why a softfork is better than a hardfork.
a softfork carries technical debt with it and leads to suboptimum solutions (as trade-off for backwards compatibility) and the old nodes not updating are zombies and not valuable nodes. The last bitcoin hf was in march 2013 after the v0.7/0.8 compatibility problem. the solution caused no problems. Any other reasonable feature enhancement or improvement of bitcoin that gets sufficient agreement would cause no problem either, today. Which dangers do you see?

Remember that 20 years ago (you were only 3 years old then, so you don't remember) a 1 GB harddisk was huge, but internet already existed (with Yahoo as the undisputed search engine  and I wrote one thesis with Microsoft Word 2.0, another one with LaTeX. My internet speed was 33.6 kbps, which was fine for email and casual web browsing in the "web 1.0", and even some mp3 downloads over night.
Today 3 TB harddisks are normal, my photo camera's memory card has 64 GB. And the trend continues.
Hence, maintaining decentralization of miners does NOT mean maintaining 1MB blocksz limit. Instead, it means maintaining blocksz limit within a range that suits the technical (bandwidth, storage) evolution. By doing this (and not overdoing it) miner decentralization is not in jeopardy.
By keeping the limit at 1MB and under the assumption of continuous Bitcoin/Crypto user adoption we will push users away from the Bitcoin blockchain (unavoidable due to limited tx capacity) towards either centralized services (bad for decentralization) or towards other cryptos with larger tx capacity (bad for bitcoin's utility, hence value).
For me [bip-100.5]( takes a very reasonable, balanced, simple and adaptive approach on block size limit better than bip100 or 101 in isolation. (and parameter tuning of bip100.5 can be debated, but current choice appears reasonable to me).

I never understood why Gavin didn't send the following message to Craig Wright encrypted with Satoshi's public key:
*"Please send me an email that contains the number 37307485274479524447856398895208704002356319833174284233787942789536834783689263584575667632422932403957703."*
If he had received this email he would have been sure for himself that Craig possesses Satoshi's private key, and yet Craig could have been sure that Gavin cannot prove to the public that Craig owns Satoshi's private key.

I think the vast majority agrees (amongst small AND big blockers by the way).


I think the problem is what "no change" means. Some think, "no change" means *technically* no hard-fork. Others think "no change" implies keeping the original idea (*social* contract), and "1MB forever" was never the original idea of Bitcoin and always meant as a temporary spam protection and never socially agreed contract as a permanent or even semi-permanent protocol solution.

Always the same fallacy. LN can increase tps virtually infinitely for FEW users, so just counting tps we can indeed reach VISA tps number.
BUT: VISA addresses 100s of Millions of different (!) users. If each one of 100 Million users opens and closes only one LN channel once in 3 months, we need 8 times today's Bitcoin tps capacity for this alone!
So, LN alone cannot bring us to VISA service parity, no matter how high the achievable tps number for LN is. Because **"tps" is the wrong metric** when only looking at this metric.

exactly. I consider a random human more likely to be Satoshi than Craig.
It's because of pure probability theory:
If I pick a human fully randomly, I can make no a priori assumptions. As a result, the probability of the random person being Satoshi is roughly 1/(7 Billion). But for CW, we know too many characteristics that set him clearly apart from Satoshi (his complete character, personality, 'track record'), so with this extra a-posteriori knowledge, we can tell with almost certainty that he is not Satoshi.

No, they time-out, and the timeout is defined when opening a payment channel.


yes, to have an example.


Due to price fluctuations you would'nt like to lock funds for too long. Also, several differen LN operators mean you have several channels open at once.


3 x 1.7 = 12 ???
My calc. assumed no segwit. for the order of magnitude, a factor 1.7 does not change fundamental conclusions.


You forgot a factor of 2: Each opening of a LN channels is followed by a closing, entailing 2 LN transactions. My calc: 93 = ca. 100, and 100 x 4 x 2 = 800 mill. TX/yr. --&gt; 8 MB blocks.

ok, misunderstanding clarified, so this is different than what I was talking about and does not apply to the case that the paper talks about, i.e. normal TXs that e.g. only have somewhat high TX fees.

It's a VERY GOOD idea **if** you do it right. if you have a real good random generator (I would use different ones incl physical dices and XOR them all together, so if only one of my random sources has excellent entropy the overall result has excellent entropy) you'd prefer to use that one instead of trusting a built-in generator that you cannot verify. the history is full of bad random generators (the famous android bug only being one of them).
So me, too, I would very much welcome a program that allows me to choose 11 words myself plus a nonce, and then the program outputs the 12th word in compliance with the checksum rules.

2 BTC = 10,000 Pizzas = 72,000 USD    
--&gt; 1 BTC = 36,000 USD, which is geo-stationary orbit but not yet Moon.

Really? So you say that the fee of a TX that is included in block N today is not always fully attributed to the miner of that block? If this is not what you say, we talk about different things (misunderstanding).




I don't know Mike's proposal, but from what you describe this is not what I had in mind. E.g. using govn't or passport ID is a really bad thing.
My idea is to have a "layer" on top of bitcoin protocol by which nodes (miners, validating nodes) communicate with each other. Such layer can be completely optional and NOT part of the consensus rules. The idea is as follows:
* First, each miner makes his own judgement whether an incoming new block is legit ot a re-mining or selfisfh mining attack over an already existing block of the same height. For example, if the time between receiving the block and the last block of same height is &gt; xx seconds, then it is likely a block with bad intentions that should not be used.
* Other miners will make the same judgement. Obviously, their measured time xx is (slightly) different because of network topography and network delays.
* Now, miners can broadcast their opinion on their judgements, signed with an individual key (NOT by govn't ID or alike!).
* Other miners will receive such broadcasts and can compare their own judgement with those of other nodes' judgments. They can individually decide whose broadcasts they consider or discard based on broadcasts' signatures, using self-configured(!) lists of "trusted" signing keys. They can also define criteria when to drop one's own judgement (e.g. if 90% of their "trusted nodes" judge differently - because then a "late block" is more to be attributed to an individual network propagation delay (topology issue) and not a block mined with malicious intent. Of course people (node operators) are free to disclose their own signing keys publicly via social networks. If they'll broadcast inadequate judgements, they'll descredit themselves, so they're not likely to do it.
*Edit: You can also think of this as a "sensor network": each node is located at another location in the network topology and broadcasts his measured times "xx". So the combined network is able to get the true picture and uncover blocks injected into the network too late with obviously bad intentions.*

I would like to keep it open, when and how the block size limit will stop growing to open the fee market. At the moment it is much too early to block adoption by pre-mature stop of block size limit growth.
A small **majority** should be required and sufficient to stop bitcoin block size limit growth. What I don't like is this pre-defined bias of BIP-100 towards "no increase", where a small **minority** can block any necessary growth. And this will not be accepted by the 80% but result in another hardfork, so why not defining a BIP-100 voting mechanism that is more future-proof.

Proof you are wrong, Mr.:
I kept on running Monero old SW after last Monero HF, but it had no impact on the eco system. No block explorer, no exchange, no player in the economy was working on "my" chain. So HF succeeded despite &lt;100% participation. Same happened to the Bitcoin HF when I kept on running v0.8 in March 2013, but it had no impact, so the Bitcoin HF succeeded despite less than 100%.
Other inaccuracies:


No, it takes long to activate and then longer to reach penetration in all wallets etc. and after some years it only reaches &lt;100% scale-up. That's exactly the opposite of fast, when looking at it objectively. Fast is "2MB now".


but they said they'll negotiate to avoid a blockage


No 5% - segwit needs 95%, not 100%. 95% - 90% = 5%


No, BU does not need 100% either.


yes it will - dial-up-miners or miners that run out of their few GB HDD space who cannot afford new HDD hardware will be out. Ask luke-jr if you do not believe.


You confuse BU with "unlimited blocksize limit". This is not the idea of BU. I had this misunderstanding also some time ago, but I learned about BU in the sequel.


Depends compared to which reference scenario. Also depends on how "contentions" is defined.
You can consider b-core contentious by defining 95% required for segwit. They should have known that a 95% policy is almost impossible to achieve and that segwit will be de-facto postponed unless you assume they are stupid or naive. So they are to blame if bitcoin segwit gets postponed now, because they designed it to fail. With e.g. 75% threshold we wouldn't have any problems now, but also 60% is possible - as long as it is safely &gt;50%. Interestingly, hardly anybody talks about it. So either everybody is so navie as to think that this &gt;5% veto comes at a surprise, or everybody thinks that b-core was so naive.

So a nicely worked-out mechanism that spreads TX fees between miner of block N and later blocks' miners would be good perhaps, too reduce the big impacts of such events.
E.g.: **TX fees of TX included in block N goes by 50% to block N's miner, by 25% to block N+1's miner, by 12.5% to block N+2's miner, etc.!** (the series might be cut-off after 3 or 5 block generations or so for practical purposes). Other alternative series can be debated like:
* [50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 6.25]%
* [30, 25, 20, 15, 10]%

As usual, Newsweek knows nothing about Bitcoin. A poor piece of journalism!
Newsweek lie **highlighted**:




*Explanation for dummies:*    
*The recipient does not give the public key to the sender! Instead a digest of the public key is given to the sender, and this digest is the result of multiple hash functions and absolutely quantum-proof!*
Newsweek FUD **highlighted**:




*Explanation for dummies:*    
*The consensus problem about the transaction limit stems from the fact that different people have different views of what is best for Bitcoin (leaving conspiracy theories aside). It is a political issue. In contrast, applying changes to make Bitcoin quantum-proof will have near 100% agreement amongst all stakeholders in the face of a quantum computer threat, because not doing it would render Bitcoin unusable. So we cannot expect a debate remotely as contentious as the block size limit debate. In other words: Former enemies will no doubt stand together united to fight a common enemy to survive. This is a behavioural pattern deep inside us humans. Newsweek understands nothing.     The quantum professor is right that block size limit is TECHNICALLY a simple problem compared to making Bitcoin quantum-proof. But the technical challenge is not the issue in the consensus problem. The SOCIAL aspect is the issue. And in social terms, finding consensus in defending Bitcoin against a quantum threat is much simpler than finding consensus about a block size limit. The quantum professor doesn't see it because he is only thinking in technical terms.*

Indeed this looks neat. But only at the first glance I am afraid.
I do not even want to talk about those big adjustment steps by a factor of *2 or /2, which are quite coarse..., the main big concern of mine is this:
**You can cripple / attack the Bitcoin system by maintaining the status quo!**
A 21% minority (and apparently this even includes lazy non-voters who don't care setting up their miners to cast a vote) can prevent that block size limit increases, when it is urgently needed! Imagine that technology advances! A 1 MB in terms of storage or bandwidth today is maybe like 2 MB two years from now! So it would not be harmful to raise limit to 2 MB in 2017, this would not exclude more miners than today with 1 MB, hence it would not make the system more "decentralized" than today. In the meantime, hopefully also Bitcoin usage and traffic have naturally increased, hopefully, so an increase to 2 MB would really be needed.
However, a 21% minority could block such increase forever and could therefore kill Bitcoin's value proposition - Bitcoins would become less and less useful than what it even was in 2015.
Another point: When should the increase from 1 MB to 2 MB happen? Hmm, now in 2015 is too early. 2016? Perhaps. In 2017: Yes, at latest now would be the right time, because of the technological advances nobody would be "excluded" as compared to 2015. But wait, in the meantime, thanks to technological advances, other miners have joined during 2016/2017 which could not yet participate in 2015, because for their low bandwith connection even the 1MB was too much. But now the 1MB is ok, thanks to technological advances. But now, if raising limit from 1 MB to 2 MB, these miners would be excluded again. So these miners will vote to KEEP 1 MB limit even in 2017. The more you wait, the more you get low-bandwidth miners into the game, that will/may block bandwidth increase forever!
Result: Bitcoin dies due to egoistic voting of (new!) low-bandwidth miners (which haven't been there 1 or 2 years before).
Another aspect: Voting for "no increase" is also a vote. So every block a miner can vote one out of 3 ways:
* (D) decrease
* (K) keep
* (I) increase
The BIP100 says: For vote (D) or (I) a 80% majority is needed, while for a vote (K) a 20% majority is sufficient. This is a clear a-priori bias towards (K), which is not by nature in the best interest of Bitcoin - but the BIP100 does as if it knows that this is the case and will always be so.
Now one could argue: Well, but if using the 50% quantile, then it would be like: Vote for (D) or (I) requires 50% majority, while (K) will rarely happen (only if the vote for (K) happens to be the median). So we will often have +100% / -50% changes. Is this good?
Answer: No, this is too disruptive. But this is only because BIP100 has defined such coarse adjustments steps like *2 or /2, but this is no god-given necessity. Also difficulty is not adjusted in such coarse steps. The whole system becomes much more graceful if block size change is decided upon much more often, while adjustment steps are accordingly smaller and less disruptive, like steps of 5% to 10% or so.

"child pays for parent" achieves this, no RBF is needed.
because ch.p.f.p. can be applied not only by the recipient but also by the sender, by utilizing the change address. example:
Alice pays 2 btc to address B of Bob:
Input = addresses A1+A2 = 1.5+1.0=2.5 btc.
Output1 = B: 2 btc
Output2 = C (owned by Alice): 0.5 btc.
Tx Fee = 0.0 btc.
If this TX is stuck, Alice can accelerate it with this payment:
Input = C
Output = D (owned by Alice) = 0.4 btc
TxFee= 0.1 btc.
So no RBF whatsoever is needed!
RBF is only needed to ease fraud.

But this would require that 79% of miners decide not to accept the 21% of miners' protocol-wise valid blocks because of their too low vote.
This would be a quite controversial strategy, because it would require the 79% of miners (or at least a big portion &gt;50% of miners) to follow this policy. This would again trigger lots of controversial discussion and could/would be perceived as a 51% attack by itself, because people would say that these "51%..79%" of miners are "attacking" the network by not accepting legitimately mined 21% of blocks, "just" because those "21%" include a too low vote!
I do not think it is a good idea to plant this seed of future turmoil and controversy into the protocol, as the 20% quantile rule does it.
I think a future protocol should instead prevent future controversy. I think, only the 50% quantile can really achieve this, because it solves the above mentioned problem right away.
For me, the only reason for not selecting a 50% quantile is that we want to give more weights to "down-voters" than to "up-voters" by definition of the protocol, and fix this for all future. This is not a fair and reasonable approach I think, because the one side (up- or down-voters) may have just as much (good or bad) reason to do so as the other side.
The 20% rule appears to me more politically than technically motivated, to be honest. Not sure if this is the case, but it looks so.
@_date: 2016-10-18 12:25:29


Well, not really. The comparison is always done wrong, I am afraid. Almost all people debating this are always looking at "TX per second (or per year)", but that's the wrong metric to look at.
The more important metric is:     "***independent*** **TX/sec (or per year)**". And here LN does not help exceeding the value of 3.
"independent" means "by different users".
Example: If 50 Million users use LN they fully(!) use up the complete(!) 3 TX/s Bitcoin on-chain capacity by each only opening and closing just one single(!) LN channel *per YEAR*.

* Fill or kill is a good idea. If tx is not confirmed until time X, then it is "free" in the wallet to try to spend it again with a higher fee. This would avoid a situation where the tx is "in limbo" for days or so... (although "child pays for parent" can also resolve such a situation today).
* The second point is not practically useful. Why should I as a user restrict my TX artififcally? I will only increase the likelihood that my TX does not get confirmed soon! Unless I am an ideological user (which we can assume most users are NOT, most are egoists in real economy), I would not do it. And if my wallet SW does it without my agreement, I will use another wallet SW as soon as I find out that my wallet SW artificially reduced the likelihood of my TX getting confirmed soon.

Also soft forks can result in two different crypto currencies.
Example: SegWit softfork:    
A segwit TX looks like an "anybody can spend" tx to a legacy node. So a legacy miner can transfer such a TX's output to himself and this would be considered illegal by a segwit node. Result: Network split.
If the old miners have &gt;50% of hash power, we end up with a network split for an upward-compatible protocol change (=soft fork).
For a downward compatible hard fork (like a block size limit increase), we end up with a network split if &gt;50% of the hash power is with new miners AND the old nodes still have enough support in the eco system (like ETH classic).
For a non-downward compatible hardfork (e.g. if new block version nb is required), a split does not require any hash majority on either side.

Nonono, Segwit was made to destroy Bitcoin. It was a huge conspiracy by the banks. I know it full well, because Rogerus Veritatis Pukerus and his friends and employees told so.
@_date: 2016-10-27 16:15:09
So one can just define in the consensus rule of the HF protocol update that no single TX is allowed to be &gt; 1MB, no matter how big the block is.
Problem solved. Very simple. I don't understsnd how people can use this as any argument to prevent or postpone 2MB blocks, other than that they are hiding their true intentions.
So everybody who brings this argument I am approaching with utmost scepticism.

Donald Trump vowed to build a massive wall along the Mexican border and to begin deporting millions of immigrants as soon as he takes office, if elected in November.
This raises spookingly strong memories to Adolf Hitler who deported Millions of Jews from Germany (yes, it was also called "deportation").
If you did a little research yourself, you would have found it yourself (but of course all these sources are just lies of the anti-Trump conspiracy /s):
Trump on Twitter: *"Sadly, because president Obama has done such a poor job as president, you won't see another black president for generations!"* (explanation to the dumb Trumpists: This is racism at its clearest, because he infers from Obama making a poor job and from Obama having black skin, that every other person with black skin must do an equally poor job - if this is not racism - what is?!). [the question how "bad" Obama's job really is is another debate of course...]
Trump: *"Laziness is a trait in blacks"*
Trump: *"An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s birth certificate is a fraud"* (no need to mention he could never prove it)
Trump: *"You know, it really doesn’t matter what the media write as long as you’ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of ass."* (yes, he has as much respect for women as for other races)
Trump: *"I will build a great wall – and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me – and I’ll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words."* (that's Trump's racist peace policy...)
Trump: *"Our great African-American President hasn’t exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore."* (this is no racism at all, of course /s)
Trump: *"The beauty of me is that I’m very rich."* (says somebody who CARES about the people?!?...)
...this list could be continued endlessly - if you do not see Trump's character you must be blinded or malevolent yourself.
...end finally, **Trumps insult to the parents of a US muslim's soldier who died in Iraq** - speechless - an unforgiving error of Trump that shows his true character in lack of empathy - a psychopath - a very dangerous one!

I was never a fan of BIP-101 because if it's too optimistic, it has in the end the same effect as "no limit at all", and then other mechanisms (that have also been discussed here in other threads) would have to make sure that blocks are mined with reasonable sizes. After thinking this further, I found out that these other mechanisms are similar to a miner voting mechanism, but less "formal" and thus more prone to secret cartels etc.
That's why I thought that this should be better done within the protocol, so I thought about BIP100. But I did not like this strong bias of BIP100 towards 0.0% growth (and this even being enforceable by a tiny 20% minority) and considered this similarly dangerous as BIP-101. But none of the two solutions really found my liking when thinking it further.
When I saw BIP100.5 I found its working principle and simplicity just marvellous. The parameters therein could of course be debatable - if a consensus is reached with the default growth tuned to 19% instead of 32%, so be it (even though I find the current parameters pretty reasonable). BIP-100.5 implies that growth is biased towards moderate growth instead of 0.0% growth to keep Bitcoin's characteristics more stable over time, but can be adjusted in the longer term, if needed without big debates, by open and transparent miner voting. Also there is this dependency on majorities in *multiple* steps: The greater the majority, the more growth can deviate from the default schedule. So there is not this 20:80 "all or nothing" dependency - this should avoid future conflicts stemming from miner minorities blocking majorities.
@_date: 2015-11-07 15:54:09


Yes, I can explain why keeping all as it is for sure cannot work mid/long-term and will push users away from the Bitcoin blockchain without any doubt.
Leaving it "the way it is" (1MB block) cannot work if we want more Bitcoin adoption, because it only allows 3 tx per second, equivalent to one tx per person per 100 years(!) if 7 billion people adopted Bitcoin (simple maths).
Hence keeping 1MB means pushing the masses off-chain (or more likely: to altcoins not having such restrictions, but let's leave that out for now), leaving only very few entities (settlement companies and very rich individuums) using the Bitcoin blockchain directly. This implies centralization!
Technology continuously advances (remember 15 years ago HDD storage was about 1/1000th of today), so block size should increase in accordance with that. This doesn't imply more centralization at all (unless block size grows too fast of course, in which case we'd have centralization of miners - but this doesn't mean it shouldn't grow at all!).
So we have the best overall system decentralization in the middle range of a not too small and not too large blocksize limit. This "optimum range" of block size limit is in the interval we could call [blockszl_min ; blockszl_max].
Naturally, over time the two variables increase! "blockszl_min" increases because of increasing user adoption, while "blockszl_max" increases because of technological advances in storage and bandwidth capacities.
While this general mechanism is fundamentally clear and can hardly be disputed, it can be disputed what the precise figures of "blockszl_min" and "blockszl_max" are (now, and in 5, 10, 20 years).
In my view, the best proposal for block size limit is [bip-100.5]( but I think it is hardly known and discussed because the author is not a famous celebrity. That mechanism is simple and yet takes account of all the problems above. It takes account of the basic mechanisms of the shift of the most decentralized area, remains adaptive, and avoids both a too long deadlock as well as too extreme fluctuations.

This is a problematic statement, and I am reading some "bias" into that statement, because it does not quantify "big" and "small". Therefore, I for my part could never agree with such a statement (neither this way nor the other way round!). I prefer to try to be as "unbiased" as possible. 
***Example***: Assuming (just for the sake of example) I am of the opinion that at present (Nov. 2015) a block size limit of 4 MB is ideal. So 3.9 MB (or anything below that) would be "too small" and 4.1 MB (or anything above that) would be too big acc. to my definition.
If you asked me: *"What is worse in your opinion, too small or too big block size limit?"*, I honestly couldn't answer this question. I would instead ask to precise your question by quantifying the extend, and depending on that my answer would differ. Examples:
* Q.: "What is worse, too small BSL like 3.9 MB or too big BSL like 4.1 MB, as of Nov.2015?" -&gt; My Answer: "Both is equally bad (but both is not really bad at all but fully uncritical)."
* Q.: "What is worse, too small BSL like 0.5 MB or too big BSL like 5.0 MB, as of Nov.2015?" -&gt; My Answer: "Too small is worse!"
* Q.: "What is worse, too small BSL like 2.0 MB or too big BSL like 1 GB, as of Nov.2015?" -&gt; My Answer: "Too big is worse!"

Of course I did not know that this is what you wanted to say. Because you didn't write it. I am not that good at reading thoughts, sorry.
Now, on your new argument: I think if such censoring happens the first time it would be discovered very quickly. Because mempool and blockchain are public. If a transaction is in the mempool for too long despite high enough fees and is not included in a block, it will create outrages in the community when this happens the first time.
So decentralization is important, so blocksize limit should be not too large and not too small.
If it was too small, it is certainly not easy to say: "Hey world, apparently we were too conservative with the block size, so let's increase blocksize and triple bitcoin adoption next week, and improve miner decentralization by tripling the miners starting next week." Because by that time users have already moved to ALTcoin, or decided that cryptos have no value proposition for them in the first place. The damage is already done.
The more I think the more I believe the world needs two big cryptos, one small block crypto and one crypto that grows with technology. Because only real life can finally show how it plays out. At the moment it seems bitcoin and litecoin will both be small-block cryptos growing much slower than technology thereby more and more centralizing the network due to too small blocks and driving people away by too high fees. That is my concern, I hope I am wrong.

Paying unconfirmed transactions would also make sense for mechanisms like CPFP (child pays for parent). I don't know if some miners out there support it already.

Yes, many. I know that Monera has a flexible block cap built in to its protocol. I know that Litecoin has a fixed TPS limit as bitcoin right now but it is 4 times greater. In case of DOGE coin there is a factor of 10. I don't know the details of all the other altcoins in existence.


I don't understand your question. supply is limited (21Mill), and capacity is limit (theory 7, practically 3 TPS).


I don't understand your question. My point is that if TPS does not change (and OP seems to suggest it need not change), real value as utility of bitcoin is very limited, and this will also be noticed by the investors, and they will not be happy if they loose money as a result.


I am of the opinion that limiting to 3 [7] TPS limits the utility and hence value and hence price of [Bitcoin|bitcoin] dramatically. I am not saying its value would be exactly zero with an enduting 3 TPS, but definitely almost zero in the long term, because other cryptos would take over, no doubt at all.
But I also have no doubt that this discussion is theoretical, because capacity will not remain at 3 TPS.
@_date: 2015-11-22 21:53:18
But concluding from this that block size increase should be avoided is definitely false, because the best decentralization is NEITHER for 1MB NOR for 1GB blocks.
The best decentralization is in between: small enough to let many participate, large enough to spread adoption (=more participants).
One could argue where the optimum for this trade-off lies, but no doubt it lies closer to 2 MB than to 1 MB as of today (Nov 2015).

Would you sacrifice 0.1% of decentralization if this helped to inrease the other metrics by several 100%?
@_date: 2015-11-09 00:04:53
Ok, so I confused 70% with 65% - so even better for the "low-or-no-growth" advocates *(edit: yes, a 36% minority could increase the block size limit by 19.2% p.a. (=doubling in 4 years) with current "BIP-100.5" parameters - that is is not really aggressive and corresponds to a massive slow-down in technological growth compared to the last 20..30 years - it brings only a factor of 33 instead of 1000 over a 20 year period)*
Again, I do not see why you say "too risky". Why is a moderate growth more risky than a 0.0% growth?? I think it's the opposite.
I think you really have to take a step back, look, and change your way of thinking here. 1 MB today is not like 1 MB in 1 year! Technology grows continuously, HDDs get bigger, home data rates increase for the same money, etc.!
So 1.0 MB "tomorrow" (say in 1 year) is like 0.x MB today! And 1.0 MB today is like 1.x MB in one year (and for sure "x" is not zero). So 0.0% growth is as if you freeze technological development and DECREASE the blocksize for the next year while the user count does not decrease. And I consider THIS really risky!
This is what the "bathtub curve" of BIP-100.5 (and I also saw it in at least one presentation of Montreal's scaling Bitcoin conference) is all about (actually the right edge of the curve - the left edge is about user adoption). We have to understand that **the system of reference (=technology and user count) changes** as time goes on, and Bitcoin block size has to track that system of reference to keep its current characteristics. With a growth rate of 0.0% we will for sure leave our system frame of reference. So, again, the best we can do to keep the system of reference is to let the BlochSz limit grow with technology by default, and not stick to 0.0% by default. Because the latter is too risky. It is so clear and evident, I don't know why people have problems to understand it.
Things have to be seen in relative terms, not in absolute terms. If everything around you changes in the same direction (technology, bandwidth, storage, user count) and you (=the block size) don't change, the overall system stops functioning the way it functioned before.
[Imagine we had had the discussion 20 years ago (the time of 33.6 kbps modems and 1GB giant hard disks). We would have had 1 kByte block sizes, and some people would have predicted that in 2015 we might have 8 or even 10 times greater data rates and hard disks than in 1995...]

This does not mean that even close of a quarter of bitcoins are traded. The same bitcoins are just changing hands multiple times. in exchanges with 0.0% transaction fees this can happen arbitrarily.
So the number 25% is meaningless.
@_date: 2016-10-23 15:40:56
They are no reference. They do it for fun because they have 100GB spare. With smaller block size, the same argument could be made for those having 50GB or 20 GB of spare space on their HDD. There is no limit to lower value.
So acc to this argument, any size would be already too large.
Serious ~~miners~~ *nodes* would buy a small HHD for a few bucks.

Lightning Networks (**LN**) will be implemented anyway. It is a protocol on top of Bitcoin and has value in any cases, also when blocks are very large. You can do great things with payment channels like micro transactions, saving substantial part of the tx fees. But first we need mainstream adoption. If "raw" Bitcoin as such is prohibitively expensive, mainstream adoption will not occur in the first place. That's what fee-market ideologists and theoretical crypto-autists regularly miss.
I hope blockstream core-devs will not **block the stream of Bitcoin adoption** by dogmatically staying with tiny block sizes while technology continues to progress. I hope blockstream core-devs will not play the role of the **useful idiots** for the surveillance-friendly powers like world governments and 3-4 letter organizations. Best decentralization is currently certainly achieved at block sizes closer to 1MB than 1GB, but also definitely closer to 2MB than to 1 MB.
As to **BIPs**, I hope people look at other options than just BIP100 or 101, like e.g. [BIP100.5]( We need to overcome the division within the "Anti-1MB-forever camp", pragmatic joint forces against the destructive small-blocker ideologists are needed.
If all this fails and if block size stays the same, we need a **challenger**: A proper altcoin as **"anti-thesis" to the small-block dogma**, with otherwise similar properties and code base as Bitcoin for easy adoption in the eco-system (i.e. no Monero: Too large blockchain, too anonymous=politically difficult, and different code-base, eco-system cannot be built quickly). Like e.g. Vertcoin (that's the best fit I personally know of judged by its technical properties). That "challenger" coin needs to have a **strong social contract** (what Bitcoin is missing) for a reasonable block size evolution that at minimum evolves with technological progress (bandwidth, storage...) and best decentralization factoring-in not only miner requirements but also taking into account that more adoption also implies more decentralization. Only in this case we'll see open competition, and then the better coin, the better "model" shall win. We can argue for ages, we'll never come to a conclusions because agendas and ideologies are too different, and too fixed in the heads. So we need to run two models in parallel I am afraid.

Even that would be bad enough, since in the face of advances in technology (bandwidths etc.) and increased TX traffic, even enforcement of keeping the limit has the same effect as reducing it. 
But anyway, I think your understanding is wrong, because the 20%-quantile vote is the vote that decides.
Example (here taking 10 votes instead for several thousand, for sake of illustration):
Votes = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} MByte.
In this case, 20% {1, 2} are removed from the bottom, and the minimum from the remaining {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} is taken as "THE VOTE that counts": Here that would be "3 MB".
If the current block size limit is 2 MBytes, this 3 MB vote is an increase.
If the current block size limit is 4 MBytes, this 3 MB vote is a decrease, i.e. a minority of "20%+epsilon" has enforced the decrease.

In the title of the OP you make what I'd call a guarantee promise.

It would help if bitcoin-core at least released a "roadmap" (in terms of intention that probable all miners and exchanges would agree to) like:
*"If median tx fee &gt; $0.20 [at a tx size of xyz bits]" for a period of &gt;= 30 days, then we want to HF to 2 MB.*
Since this does not happen, the common IMPRESSION (whether right or wrong I don't know) amongst many is that bitcoin-core NEVER wants to exceed and HF above 1 MB. The common impression amongst BU supporters is that they (b-core/blockstream) have postponed it many times in the past and always find a new reason why to postpone it. It is a loss of trust in bitcoin-core about their true intentions. Maybe this mistrust is unfounded, but it is there, that is a fact. And BECAUSE it is there, segwit is stuck now at only 85%.
So it is core who planted the seed for this problem, and BU movement with its 15% hashrate is the logical result. Whether you like it or not. You can bash on BU as much as you want. If you (or b-core or blockstream) want to change the situation, b-core must change its behaviour and earn more trust. But maybe its too late for that already.
And again some conspiracy theories say this is exactly what some players in b-core want, because they behave such that we have exactly the result that we see now such that innovation is stuck, acc. to their hidden agenda (AXA, Goldman Sachs, etc.) to sabotage Bitcoin.
I am not saying that these conspiracies are true, just saying that enough people are seriously believing that important actors within b-core/blockstream try to sabotage Bitcoin this way in an obviously subtle manner.

I hope this question remains theoretical.
But if Bitcoin devs keep stubburn and keep block size at 1MB forever (or are too conservative on blocksize compared to user adoption and technological advance in bandwidth and storage), such that Bitcoin mutates to a low-capacity centralized system, then the question will be asked, and other cryptos will gain market share from Bitcoin, no doubt at all.
Simply because a crypto currency has its inherent value because of its PRACTICAL utility, not because of its theoretical concept.

Can somebody explain how the new (hypotetical) bots are supposed to work?
For Willybot it was clear! It was fraud - Bitcoins were bought at MtGox from USD but those USD only existed in the internal books of MtGox and were never paid out, i.e. never really existed.
Is OP suggesting that the same kind of fraud happens today at one or several Chinese exchanges. If so, we should soon see reports that people cannot withdraw RMB from Chinese exchanges.
If the supposed bots are operating without making any loss (i.e. just buying as much as they are selling), I doubt that they can influence the price in any direction, since they create a balanced amount of buy and sell pressure.
So I suppose that these rumors about Willybot 2.0 are only rumors, unless somebody can substantiate the rumor.

Even if the odds that someone accidently mistypes a bitcoin address to get another valid bitcoin address are relatively high (like 1:100 or so), the odds that this other bitcoin address is actually owned by somebody is **hyper-astronomically low** (as long as addresses are generated with proper random generators)!!! Even if all computers in the world start "mistyping" bitcoin addresses from today until the end of the universe's life, it is unlikely to create collisions of addresses.
So, in your particular case, if you really received 0.2 BTC on an address that was not yet known to the blockchain before, the only reasonable and realistic explanation is that your Bitcoin address is NOT SAFE! Maybe it was found by malware (maybe the associated private key as well), maybe the address was generated by a bad random generator or with a brain wallet.
What computer system / HD wallet software do you use? How was the address generated? Why are you saying "my HD wallet**s** [plural]" - typo or really plural? Why plural? where several smaller amounts received on more than one (how many?) addresses, adding up to 0.2 BTC?
tl;dr: Consider your bitcoin keys unsafe (due to bad randomness or malware), don't store large amounts of bitcoins on these address(es)!

 the difference is that AB miners have huge (!) incentive to stop bitcoin's progress in terms of prohocol improvements, use cases, user adoption, value appreciation. If this is not clear we don't need to discuss any further.




Jihan is much(!) better off with AB enabled non-segwit bitcoin at value of 500USD/BTC, than with a non-AB SegWit bitcoin at 10,000 USD/BTC. Because in the former variant he is highly profitable, while in the latter case he's not nevessarily profitable at all.
If that is unclear, we don't neef to talk any further.


Exactly!! But Asicboost poses exactly this problem! That's why it is so toxic, and why some people call it an "attack" (the suitability of the wording "attack" can be debated, but for sure it is highly toxic for Bitcoin!)

I agree it needs more discussion to find the best long-term protocol adjustment. We should not hurry and decide for a sub-optimum solution too quickly.
In the meantime, if TPS rates increase, there is no reason why not increase in small steps to keep the system alive (or "kick the can down the road" until we have a sustainable solution).
You say +0.5 MB per year (or +50% per year?), I'd say perhaps BIP102 (=2MB) as intermediate solution, but that's all the same idea in principle. Major miners anyway have agreed to 8 MB already I think, so this should give us, the community, enough time to elaborate further proposals, I am sure there is more that can be decided amongst than just BIP100 or BIP101.

My vision is this:
Bitcoin does *not* *[edit: word "not" was added, sorry]* need to be a payment layer in that every single so often-quoted "starbucks coffee" is paid on-chain. This should well happen off-chain, like in a coinbase-to-bitpay payment where coinbase and bitpay settle for example once per day "on-chain"; or within a Lightning payment channel.
On the other hand, the network should still have enough capacity to allow every user to manage the own finances on-chain, like moving some savings to an offline-wallet and "withdrawing" a few bitcoins from the offline-wallet to the "everyday-use-coinbase-account" or vice versa. For such operations I'd expect that each user should be able to perform one on-chain payment once every week or month.
The same applies, if the "off-chain" solution is realized by lightning payment channels. An on-chain transaction is needed to open a payment channel, another on-chain transaction is needed to close it. Assuming that each user opens 4 payment channels each month, that yields a network load of 8 on-chain transactions each month per each user.
So overall, as an order of magnitude, it seems reasonable to assume that the capacity should be able to perform **10 on-chain Bitcoin transactions per user per month**.
This requires about...
    *    1 MB blocks for     700,000 users
    *   10 MB blocks for   7 Million users
    *  100 MB blocks for  70 Million users
    *    1 GB blocks for 700 Million users
    *   10 GB blocks for   7 Billion users
    
    (all assuming 10 on-chain transactions per user per month)
Note that 10 MB are already possible today, so what is missing is a factor 1000 for world-wide adoption. Is this a problem?
Not really - world-wide adoption is not expected to happen immediately. Even when assuming a 41% yearly growth of capacity and bandwidth per year, then we reach a factor 1000 in 20 years (25% growth p.a. requires 31 years to reach a factor of 1000).
(a factor 100 requires 14 resp. 21 years for 41% or 25% p.a.)

your arguments might be "mathematically" correct but ignore reality.
as a matter of fact 0-conf tx ARE ok in 99% today. hence they CAN be practically used for many purposes! That's reality. full stop.
saying "don't accept 0-conf tx" is like saying "don't accept any credit card payments, because cc numbers can be easily stolen."
(admittedly, 0-conf are much safer than cc payments in terms of fraud rate, so the comparison is not balanced)

only internet firms. So pgp or aes256 encrypted zip containers or telegram or surespot end-to-end encryption messengers are still possible.
Also you can send encrypted data that looks like unencrypted data to any nsa observer. Examples:
* Ex.1: send two images, one being a noisy version of the other one (or both being different noisy versions of the base image. the least significant bits of the delta RGB values of each pixel have to be concatenated to yield the encrypted data. No NSA observer could tell if the image pixel noise was added by normal image sw or by encrypted data.
* Ex.2: same as previous ex., but with audio file and sound samples instead of pictures.
* Ex.3: Write a normal unencrypted text via email. The bit sequence is encoded into the text for example as follows: A sentence with an even number of letters means "0", a sentence with an odd number if letters means "1". Other undetectable encoding methods can be conceived.
If the state follows the mentioned banning plans, terrorists will move to these methods and the nsa will have an even harder time than now to follow criminal communication.

I described it here during the ETH fork, and it was linked to even from non-reddit sites. basically you split coins in both chains by sending to different addresses, from there on they are mutually replay protected.


you misunderstand completely how exchanges work (you are not the only one, also heto blogger jimmy dong got this completely wrong recently). exchanges don't buy or sell themselves, they just provide a platform and get fees.


ues, if no fork. but if the non-segwit chain includes an anyone can spend transaction that contains a segwit tx that the non segeit chain spends to "anybody", then you have the fork and the non SegWit chain (if it had more hash power at the beginning) will run danger to get orphaned as soon as it will grt overtaken by the uasf chain!


I don't neef to.


the other (i.e. non segwit) chain is a time bomb (see above) that nobody will want to work with, because it can be orphaned away, see above, do nobody serious will want to buy these assets on such a fork that had clearly lost its "immutability" properties. Hence this chain is deemed to fail. Sorry.


seems you missed something :)


As said, the result is clear upfront: the non-segwit fork is deemef to get orphaned away. Conversely, the segwit fork cannot technically be orphaned away, because it is a soft fork :-)

We were talking about HF. It is not really clear what you talk about when you "jump around". But ok...


it is a property, not a vulnerability at all. But ok...


It will only persist up to the point where'the UASF chain overtakes the other chain. At that noment the other chain will disappear (orphan) by reorg towards the UASF chain (and hence no sane mind will buy "other coins" if they soon run danger of disappear, and hence the coins on non-segwit chain cannot get any other than very marginal market value. Is this so difficult to see?). If you deny this, we do not need to talk any further.


And the hash power is determined by market demand adn nothing else. If market demand is for UASF, hash power will follow with rational egoistic miners. That's why in the end only the market (i.e. the users. i.e. the buyers of Bitcoin, the buyers of the coins mined by the miners) determines the way Bitcoin goes. Anything else is illusion.

If they think they have full control, yes. But they have *some* say.
Thinking that they have no say is also a big flaw by many.
In reality, all are players of a techno-socio-economical system mutually influencing each other. For example, if 80% miners came to the conclusion that they would like to support BU, it would have more than zero effect. It would trigger discussions amongst other players (like exchanges, service companies), and if they also express their support, the change will happen.
Of course many "ifs". Just saying that the notion that miners have no say at all, as many do, is pretty wrong.

That's why I like [BIP100.5]( so much.
It is able to "correct" a wrong prediction and hence does not rely on correct upfront prediction for the next 2/5/10/20... years.
(Parameterization of the 8 tuning parameters could be done to fine-tune that BIP)


I also hope Lightning is going to fly. It is needed to accommodate the adoption that we all want. Unfortunately some people (not even the Lighning guys themselves) think with lightning a block size increase is not needed.


Absolutely. (I think also BIP-100.5 argues this way)

...not only America. Same world-wide. Negative interest is already reality in Switzerland and starting to become reality in Germany. Yes it is a new experiment, just like the end of the gold standard (bretton-woods) in 1971 was a new experiment. This experiment changed the modus operandi and survived more than 40 years. I expect that the new modus operandi (negative interest rates with continued quantitative easing and abandoning physical cash) will also survive another many decades.
I am not saying that I like it, but I think it is realistic to see this happening. The world keeps on turning, and saying "everything will crash" (like many crash prophets simplistically do) is a bit too simple and even meaningless, because nobody specifies what he means by "crash". Will the world stop revolving? Will we have a war? Will we have a political revolution? Will money simply loose value more than before? Everybody has a different understanding of "crash", starting from "apocalypse with breakdown of all industrial activity" to "disruption/evolution in the monetary system". If you consider the latter the crash, then yes, we'll have a crash, as we had a crash in 1971 and many times afterwards. Without apocalypse.
Interesting to see which role Bitcoin will play in the future - it can play an important role also without apocalyptic crash and with a mere "evolution" of the current fiat monetary system.

I was implicitly assuming that that "low-s-value" thing is already fixed (hence not an issue in my proposal) and I rather had the other 6 issues in mind that are listed in bip-62, and bip-62 even states explicitly that not all cases can be solved and that it's not clear if the list is complete.
With my simple proposal one could make any transaction "bullet proof" against tx malleability at the expense of some extra space (= slighly higher tx fee). It would be a very useful feature if the sender could choose whether or not he wants this extra layer. Mainstream end-user wallets could default to always include this extra layer to avoid bad surprises (and in "expert mode" might be able to switch it off to save some fractions of 0.1cent in tx fee).

Last sentence of the video:


This is not untrue, but very misleading in that it omits mentioning the crucial distinction that we are talking here about two **different kinds of money** (both of which are unluckily commonly referred to by the same word, namely "money", and use the same currency unit (e.g. "EUR"), and are hence wrongly set "equal" in layman's perception):
* on the one hand, "central bank money" (=legal tender).
* on the other hand, "debt money" or "commercial banks' IOUs for central bank money" (not legal tender).
The distinction between these two moneys vanishes in daily practice, because we use them completely interchangeably in our daily lives, and the existence of ATMs gives the false impression of full equivalence between these kinds of moneys.
Only in the rare events of bank runs or bank crisis/bank bankruptcies people get (sometimes!) reminded that they are not the same.
I say "sometimes", because usually people still fall for the misconceptions of equivalence between these moneys, because upon these events (like in Cyprus) people usually say that the commercial banks have "stolen" their money. But this is factually incorrect. The truth is even worse and beyond laymen's comprehension: The banks *never owned* that money in the first place (by definition of how the banking money system works!)! They only made a *promise* to pay that money back upon request and now defaulted (=admitted they cannot keep that promise).
People would comprehend all this much better if not the same term ("money", "EUR") was used for both kinds of money. To understand the money system, people should think of two distinct "commodities" as follows (taking here EUROs for the sake of example):
* Commodity A = **C**entral bank money or **C**ash or "**C-EUR**".
* Commodity B = **D**ebt money or private banks' IOUs or "**D-EUR**" (more precisely, every single private bank (a, b, c, ...) issues its own "Da-EUR", "Db-EUR", "Dc-EUR", ...)
In usual commercial life, the exchange rate beween C-EUR and D-EUR is pretty much 1:1, which makes us forget in daily routine that these are different euros. The reason for an 1:1 exchange rate can be justified in that the disadvantage of the D-EUR just being IOUs for "real" C-EURos are offset by the much higher *convenience* of handling electronic D-EURos. However, there are some situations where the exchange rate is not 1:1:
Some merchants value D-EUR higher than C-EUR because of its convenience.
At certain times of banking crisis, the C-EUR is valued (much) higher than the Dx-EUR of certain banks "x".
**TL;DR:**  Remember that money is not same as money and EUR (or any other fiat) does not equal EUR. Instead always remember that there is the C-EUR and the Dx-EUR (of priv. bank "x"), these are different things and just TREATED equal for convenience with 1:1 exchange rate, and all referred to as "EUR" for simplicity.

All I am saying is that it makes no sense to speculate - and I said it already - you only know in retrospect.
Your original statement is ridiculous - saying wither it goes to 20-30k or it crashes. This is dumb nonesens, NO MATTER what the actual outcome will be!!!
- Maybe it crashes to $700 - then you have been right, but not because you are smart but because you were lucky.
- Maybe it goes straight to 25k - then you have been right, but not because you are smart but because you were lucky.
- Maybe it goes to $3217 and crashes afterwards to $1047. The you were wrong.
In ANY market situation, you'll find random people predicting all possible future variants. Sure, some of them will be right in retrospcet. But what does that prove about their intelligence? NOTHING!
IF you want to be smart, you better accept this and do not make wild predictions in the hope that they become true, and if they will, you say "I told you so"! MAybe you'll even believe yourself you were smart, not knowing that you were only lucky!
One more reason you cannot possible know:  few strong players are able to move the price substantially in the current situation (still low volumes in Bitcoin exchanges). So since you are not them, you CANNOT know what they'll be doing next. Also, you cannot predict geo-political events, which will influence price one way ore the other.
So you CANNOT know, but yet you think you are smart and can predict the future. This is ridiculousl. Even moire ridiculous (and which makes you look dumber than all the other "prophets") is that you say that only a crash or a strong upmovement can occur but something in betwen cannot. This is about the dumbest I ever heard. As if the upmovement (when it happens - your upmovement on the way to "20-30k") cannot be stopped by a geopolitical or technological event.
TL;DR: I want to point  out that you are not half as smart as you are (on the contrary!), no matter what will happen in the future, and that someone who thinks he can predict the future (as you obviously do) is a dumb and ridiculous personality. You should have more respect of the unknown future and accept it is unpredictable to so details as you named them.

With the tech improvements I just wanted to show clearly that growth = 0% is not the best choice.
As for your other point about consistency of BIP-100.5:
As I understand, what you are saying is that always any colluding miner majority of 51% can enforce a block size reduction below any limit "X" MB by simply not accepting blocks greater than "X" MB. Yes, theoretically true. The question is if they are really going to do it - because this would be perceived as a 51% attack against the protocol by the community and would damage the reputation of the respective mining pools. So I think just because they *can* do it, they not necessarily *will* do it. Especially because orphaning cannot happen in the secret, it is visible by the public. That's why I think this concern is not fully relevant in practice as it is in theory.
However, I think you have a point here in that a too large (and too long enduring) "gap" between the protocol's block size limit and the miners' actual preferences would cause tensions that may eventually lead to a situation where miners do collude and perform block orphaning in the way you describe it.
So, what does it mean? After thinking about it I come to the conclusion:
It would ideally imply: The new valid block size must be at the 50%-quantile (or at an even lower quantile) of the vote vector. (by the way irrespective of the previous block size, because the system is memory-less!).
Assume for example that the vote vector (which normally consists of 12,000 votes in BIP100 and 2,016 votes in BP100.5) has only 11 votes for simplicity here, and the 11 votes are voting for an absolute block size limit of
* [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] MB respectively.
What should the new block size limit be? Answer: It should be &lt;=6 MB. Because, if it is 7 MB (due to some reasons of the BIP protocol's voting rules), the miner majority of 6/11*100 = 54.6% could enforce blocks &lt;=6 MB by orphaning larger ones. That is the essence of your point, I got it.
So overall, this would imply that we should always have to vote by 50% quantile (or 40% quantile... at least a X% quantile with X&lt;=50), i.e. the new max blocksize is always directly determined by the 50% quantile of the votes, without any limits or constraints, and that's it.
Practically, one could introduce some deviation from that theoretical rule, i.e. a 55% quantile rule would probably still work in practice, because a 54% majority may be considered too risky for the attackers to start an orphaning attack on too large blocks.
So, coming back to the BIP-100.5 proposal, I take that your idea could be accommodated by adjusting it's parameters for example as follows:
* P55=P60=P65=...=P80=P90=2^(512/512) = 2, i.e. a 55% majority is sufficient to impose any (almost arbitrary) change of blocksize limit from -50% to +100% per every 2 weeks.
* The parameter P0 (default growth) would be of rather negligible interest in this case, because in most cases probably a 55% vote majority will be found to change the block size limit in one direction or another. Only in case of very balanced voting a tiny instantaneous (bi-weekly) default adaptation of 1.09% (=32.5% p.a.) will be done (or whatever "P0" is chosen to be).
I think, after thinking about it, your point is very interesting and valid and should be taken into consideration for the voting mechanism, maybe BIP100.5 should indeed be amended to take this into account. Having said this, it is clear that votes that are *slightly* violating the strict consistency with the existing power structure should be no practical problem, because miners won't colluded to start an "orphaning attack" in a "low benefit/high risk profile", i.e. if they have only a small 51%-57% or so majority or if the blocks are just 10% larger than what they would like them to be, they are unlikely to start an orphaning attack. However, huge tensions should be avoided upfront by definition of the voting protocol, I agree.
Thanks for the good point.
*Edit: By the way, also in the "other direction" tensions with the existing power structure should be avoided. This means, the quantile should not be too far below 50%, because otherwise the large majority of miners that would like to have bigger blocks but does not get it due to voting rules may likely collude to create a hard-fork. Of course this is a bigger step than in the other direction where a small block miner majority just has to reject unsuitable (too big) blocks within the rules of the current protocol. However, also the tension in the other direction should not be too large.*

Exactly. If Bitcoin has no real-world utility, it will be of little interest for investors.
E.g. if Monero or another altcoin with otherwise similar properties as Bitcoin (e.g. Litecoin, Vertcoin) have more TPS capacity and Bitcoin stubburnly/ideologically stays at 3 TPS, then eco-system will change to those other crypto-currencies for REAL WORLD USE, and as a result, also investors will change. Seeing Bitcoin only as an investment vehicle without real-word utility is stupid, and in this case the critics are right who say that Bitcoin has little to no intrinsic value (in terms of utility in real-world economy).

We don't know, but it is extremely likely, especially because of China's exchanges 0% fee policy (if you ever heard of it). More volatility (as we have it these days) means more day-trading, which implies buying and selling the SAME bitcoins over and over again. The zero-fees make the daytrading even more attractive.


Day-trading is not "fake" trading. It is absolutely normal trading. I do not imply that there is substantial "fake" trading. (with "fake" trading I am implying that somebody artificially increases the volume with the purposes of making the volume appear larger to the general public.

What are you talking about? BIP101 proposes 8x, not 8000x !
BIP101 proposes 8000x by 2036 only. (note I support [BIP100.5]( because I am thinking looking that far into the future is not possible - a predefined schedule like BIP101 or BIP103 might be too conservative or too optimistic.)




Yes, but apparently only very slowly. Probably too slow in case of BIP103. Same for BIP100, where a 20% minority can block anything. BIP102 is meant as an intermediate solution anyhow and is very reasonable.

your points are not very precise, so it's difficult to have a decent discussion. E.g.:


Unclear what you mean - which liabilities do central banks have?
private banks have liabilities to their account holders, or to other private banks, or to the centeral bank.
but a central bank that creates a credit towards a private bank has a receivable, not liability, towards the private bank.
concerning unwinding balance sheet: the fiat money system is not designed for that. it is designed for infinite expansion of credit and inflation, so the question of when the debts should ever be paid back (balance sheet unwinded) is the wrong question and can only be asked by someone not understanding how the debt money system works. The only "cure" is inflation.
Bitcoin works ENTIRELY different (and is actually much easier to understand than fiat/debt money).

I see. Well, it is first and foremost a business optimisation, yes.
but in effect it is an attack in so far that it gives the AB miner such a huge competitive advantage that he can monopolize the mining industry, which is bad for bitcoin.
people sayin it is an "attack" on bitcoin mean it this way, ie they mean it is an attack vector in so far that an asicboost miner behaving in his best rational egoistic self-interest is no more acting in bitcoin economy's best interest. This is due to new systemic constraints! This is a fundamental change in bitcoin's security structure and it endangers bitcoin.
In so far, these *new economical circumstances/incentive structures* is what poses a THREAT to bitcoin.
That's why they call it an "attack".
This should not be confused with an attack that directly tries to steal funds or directly tries to sabotage the network. It is more a kind of "**implicit attack**" rather than "**explicit attack**" - yes I think these terms summarise it best.

I am not a node operator but understand the general threats and opportunities of the various alternatives.
I am bitcoin user and market participant, so I have the right to speak as well. I am in favour of segwit asap, and then evolve the protocol, the use cases, the eco system (and through all this also the price) further! Bigger blocks should be part of such evolution at some point, but first lay the groundwork for a sustainable evolution wrt blockchain efficiency and simple code technical debt for future evolutions, i.e. clearly segwit first.

Create a statement that ...
- says he is not CSW
- contains a most recent Bitcoin blockchain block hash as proof that the statement was created after time t1.
- register the resulting signed message in the blockchain as proof of existence that it was created before time t2.
- Choose t1 and t2&gt;t1 such that it coincides with a public appearence of CSW, such that it is clear he couldn't have done this himself, because we was busy otherwise during that time.
Hmm, well, it would still be possible that a self-written script by CSW accomplishes all this automatically. So we need an element included in this statement that gives better evidence that the statement was created by a human, not by a script or bot. Any idea what that could be?

Seems that adult content may lead the way to adoption of new technologies once again (just like it did for VHS video).
My vision (i.e.: that's how I think it is likely to happen):
- First adult/porn sites will allow pay-per-view of special clips (i.e. high video quality, complete video incl. the follow-up of the free trailer) for a few cents in bitcoin. Users will appreciate this, and will particularly appreciate the pseudonymous payment method and that they don't have to register. Users will load their smartphone wallets with $10-$30 of pocket money or so, such that they always have some coins at hand when needed.
- In the sequel, other internet sites offering non-adult content will discover similar benefits for their business model. E.g. sites offering high quality journalism news articles, financial data, niche topics of any kinds, ...

Indeed you don't get it. Maybe you have not followed reddit closely recently. It was explained in detail. Bitmain / Jihan Wu has all incentive to prevent SegWit because of his competitive advantage with patented ASICBOOST, which destroys the alignment of miner incentives with community interest, which is catastrophic.
Miners are very rational and care about profit more than anything else.
It was explained in detail by me, and a week later or so also in a video by Andreas Antonopulous, that the miner incentive through ASICBOOST is huge even if w/o AsicBoost and with SegWit the price would 10-fold or more.

There is both cultural, social and economic interest to stand together.

The signature that the sender adds to the transaction should cover every single bit of the transaction (incl. any tx IDs or whatever), and not only input+output addresses and fee and amounts. This way, any malleability would be impossible.
The fact that this is not the case seems like a fundamental and completely unnecessary Bitcoin design flaw, actually I am shocked that it is still there.
I am even more shocked to read that there might(?) be several different/unknown malleability attacks possible.
Shouldn't it be easy to fix once and for all this with a protocol upgrade which respects the most basic property of a digital signature, namely that the signature spans over the COMPLETE transaction string? I cannot see what disadvantages this should bring and assume the fix should be relatively simple for a new protocol version.

The "excess fees" could go to future blocks' miners instead of current block's miner, with the exact future block number being random e.g. acc. to a function of block hash or so.
That way, miners creating own high-fee transactions would send these fees to other future miners and not to themselves, thereby fake transactions are "disincentivised". However, if transactions are real transactions, miners may still have incentive to include them because some of the future miners would be themselves.
The same mechanism resides in the "amended" "bitpay proposal" that I posted several months ago, but it was probably not read by many.

Ok, then I agree, technically then it is correct, and it was just completely confusing. You should have clarified from the start that you are talking about a HF. Anyway, now it is clarified :-)
In that scenario that you are painting, it is in effect the same as a normal hardfork (like a BU hardfork would be today), just that it would be *triggered* in the community by the event of a UASF.
The fact that this HF does not happen now makes me believe that it wouldn't happen in the UASF case either. In fact the motivation would be even less! Today, BU hard forkers could argue: "blocks are full, we are offering BU to solve it." But once SegWit activates, this argument is less pressing as SegWit will provide relief by providing more on-chain capacity, esp. as this is only the first step in bcore's scaling roadmap that is unlocked with SegWit. This and the fact that SegWit would give many new use cases to Bitcoin would give little reason to users/rational investors to believe that the hard fork chain would have any relevant future. I personally doubt it would happen, and if it does, it would attain very little value, probably max. 10% of Bitcoin's segwit-enabled main chain.
Moreover, the hard-forkers need to create a new brand name and think about some means to do replay protection (should be easy though if they hard-fork anyway - a few bits ordered differently and the TXs become incompatible/unreplayable). The remaining bad thing then is confusion by the less savvy users and the risk to use the wrong address. Also the latter can be prevented easily (because to use HF-chain one anyway has to use new wallets, so the simplest (and at the same time efefctive) solution is to mandte a certain prefix for all BU-addresses, e.g. old address "1shd5gJdS34vMaAwkHgnsKf78SkLFfR" becomes "**BU**1shd5gJdS34vMaAwkHgnsKf78SkLFfR" such that confusion and user dissatisfaction and frustration on both BTC and BU gets avoided.
In fact with this precautions I think it would be a great solution for the community:
- Bitcoin would continue to exist, and most users and applications use SegWit-enabled Bitcoin and its enhancements like LN, RSK, MAST, Schnorr, etc. etc., while hardforked BU would follow an own ideological path
- Community would be appeaced because everybody can put energy into the part that s/he thinks is best.

The best tutorial I've ever seen so far on the fiat monetary system, very good also didactically.
All the series of six videos also available in the following youtube playlist: 
(beginners please start with part 1).
Note: The fractional reserve ratio in USA (FED) is 10% and Europe (ECB) 1% (2% until 2 years ago or so), but the rest of the mechanisms (like inter-bank settling and lending etc.) is the same everywhere. But in Europe and USA the "pyramid model" rather than the "balloon model" applies w.r.t. the fractional reserve mechanism.
Note: I wouldn't say the "money multiplier model" is "wrong", I think it is over-simplifying, but didactically still useful to teach the general public the basic PRINCIPLES of how private banks create money in an ILLUSTRATIVE way. It is the best model to educate the GENERAL PUBLIC about the misconception of the banks just being a middleman lending out savers' money. Actually, when I personally learned about the fractional reserve system it was clear to me that the money multiplier model is just a simplifying model explaining some principles of fractional reserve banking for somebody who has never come across this concept before. So the video  did not come to me as a surprise at all but perfectly confirmed my current understanding. However, if universities teach this money multiplier model as the ultimate truth (rather than a simplifying model) to their finance &amp; economics students without going a step further explaining the actual mechanisms, then this would be really disturbing. (I studied a technical subject, so I cannot tell from personal experience)

If you want "undo button", Full RBF is a bad choice, because the TX can already be included in a block after a few seconds, so undo by RBF won't work any more. Instead, have a wallet that delays the broadcast after pressing "send" - then you have the undo function that you want from user perspective - with a fixed deterministic time as the user would expect it.

The article suggests that anonymous hackers have identified "bitcoin accounts" (probably addresses) that are associated with IS.

And therefore, IS can no more use Bitcoin for the future, because their bitcoin account has been hacked. So they have to use cash now in the future.

I had a similar incident many years ago with Sparda Bank and Bitstamp. But all it took me was a phone call explaining that it is all right, and I never had a problem again.
I think you can do the same: Call them politely, ask what happens, they answer that the Kraken account number is labeled as fraudulent in their system.
Then you say: *"Thank you for this good customer service to try protect me from sending money to fraudulent accounts, I appreciate it. But in this case I am confident that this destination account number is legit, I know the company behind, which has a good reputation from all I have heard (and I have heard a lot) and I have never heard anything fraudulent from them. So please remove the blacklisting for this destination account, at least for me, thank you!"*
I am confident they will now serve your request. If they still reject your request, then you explain: *"I consider it as normal service that I can make free transactions from any SEPA bank account to any other SEPA bank account. When you hinder me to do it, you force me to use an intermediate account via which I send my money to the desired destination account. This is a hassle for me and I perceive this as extremely bad customer service, if you hinder me from doing what a bank account is supposed to do. While I understand that you send me a warning if you have hints that the destination account MIGHT be fraudulent, I have no understadning if you still reject this service now that we have talked about it. I also doubt that you are even ALLOWED to block this service, because SEPA bank transfers should be possible between any two SEPA accounts. If you think you are entitled to boycott certain bank account permanently even against my (=your customer's) will, please tell me based on which legal regulation or law you are allowed to do so. Thanks"*
If they still reject, then say you'll consider reporting their behaviour to the police or to the "Bankenaufsicht", and make the transfer via another bank. As a second step, consider closing your account with that bank.

As interest rates decrease further (and possibly become sustainably negative at some point), I expect that new paper cash notes will be issued that have a built-in demurrage: They are facing three pieces of information (printed as plain text and QR code):
* Nominal face value
* Day of issuance
* Demurrage (percent per day)
At a point of sale, if a customer pays by cash, the sales person scans the bill's QR code to determine the current value of the cash.
Example: nominal face value = 10 EUR, day of issuance = 1st June 2019, demurrage = 0.01% per day (=3.6% p.a.).
If you pay on 2nd February 2020 with that bill (246 after issuance day), it will be worth only 10€ * (1-0.01/100)^246 = 9.76€.
Of course this has a similar effect as a correspondingly higher inflation without demurrage to the end-user.

@_date: 2015-11-09 03:02:22
Thanks. I see your point and answered on this (=I "thought out loud")  in the other longer reply.
Just a note: From my analysis (see that other longer reply) I came to the conclusion that this question of "consistency" between voting result and actual mining power structure is not a question of whether the block size limit is in or decreased compared to "last time".
It is strictly speaking only a question of the comparison of two things:
* The new effective block size limit after applying the BIP's rules
* "The voting vector" of the last voting period (and esp. the 50% quantile of that voting vector) [plus the 55% quantile or 60% quantile, to take account of the effect that an only small violation of the power structure is not likely to trigger an "orphaning attack"]
To have a realistic risk of an orphaning attack, two conditions must be fulfilled:
* The colluding mining majority must be sufficiently high to take the risk of the attack
* And: The gap between "desired block size" and actually effective block size limit must be sufficiently high and painful to justify the attack (knowing this might imply risking the reputation of the mining pool since it could be perceived by the community as a 51% attack)
Having said all this, I think you had a good point that is worth considering to further improve (inofficial) available BIP proposals like BIP100.5.

on top of what was said already, you and everybody have to face reality:
high user adoptio together with low fee together with high decentralization - this doesn't fit together! you have to compromise!
* compromise on decentralization --&gt; ripple
* compromise on user adoption --&gt; litecoin, vertcoin
* comprimise on blocksize and fee --&gt; Bitcoin
If we go the BU way, Bitcoin becomes another Ripple. Certainly, some people would like to see that happen. Not me.

Similar idea: paper wallet lottery: print some paper wallets (like with bitaddress.org tool), and load some mBTC on *some* of them. Then print flyers explaining briefly this "lottery": you have one paper wallet with x btc, another with y btc, rest is empty. Distribute them amongst school kids. They'll have to check their balance with a smartphone qr code scanner to see if they "won". The winner shall spend (or sweep) the balance before &lt;date&gt;, otherwise you as the game master will take them. The flyer should also give some examples where to spend the btc, so e.g. the winner can buy a party pizza for his/her friends :-)

the bitcoin paper certainly did not foresee a miner attack as we see it by Jihan now.
you should not stop thinking after reading the whitepaper. it is a guidline, but no holy script that contains concrete answers to all future problems.
however, when understanding the general idea of bitcoin from the whitepaper, it is a no-brainer that a tendency of miner centralization, as we see it now, must be resisted by the community. and uasf is the right way.
I am surprised that you don't realize this attack.

you couldn't be wronger - read on


technically impossible. if the non-segwit chain becomes the minority chain (the one with less hash power) then it will no longer exist but reorg towards the uasf segwit chain. This is so because SegWit is a SOFT fork. This is the very definition of "soft fork", and this is what makes it fundamentally different from a HF.

for coffee payments you have online wallets like coinbase who do it for you, and you don't own you private keys here but have counterparty risk and censoring risk.
The decentralised version of this is Lightning Network - similar setup, but you own the private key and can close the channel when you like by directly going to the public blockchain, this corresponds to a btc withdrawal from coinbase but without being dependent on coinbase's goodwill/cooperation.
so if you want to buy coffee with bitcoin one day at large scale in a STILL DECENTRALISED bitcoin network, you do want lightning network.

if you are a miner personally, i understand your rational egoistic financial motives, but you are not acting in bitcoin's and user's best interest if you want to change bitcoin to become more centralized, and your intentions are hence disapproved.

it depends on overall cost structure which includes HW cost etc. theoretically it could imply only 1% or even 0% of extra profit if electricity is free. but that's not typical. typical is that many miners operate at low profit margins, so the 20% electr savings amount to MUCH more than 20% profit gain. Example knc miner : they operated @ neg. profit w/o AB and went bankrupt. Had they used AB with 20% lower elec cost, they would've been highly profitible. --&gt; profit gain more than "infinity" percent.

@_date: 2017-05-25 11:36:16
however, this assumes 2^256 possibilities (256 bits private key).
But to crack a paper wallet, we "only" need 2^160 possibilities (which is still astronomical), because this is the nb of different addresses that exist, i.e. different private keys can have the same address, and you need to find ANY private key that generates this address.
Moreover, if I am not mistaken, SegWit addresses have not 160 but only 80 bits of protection (that's what I remember to the best of my memory - pls correct if I am wrong).

Obviously, ledger is conceptually vulnerable to computer malware, so the only reason that there (probably) does not yet exists malware stealing Ledger funds is that Ledger is still to young and not wide-spread enough, i.e. there is not enough incentive for developing such malware.

This is my second reply to your post:
I am not so sure anymore that you have the right understanding of how creation of debt money by the private banks work. Reading your post a second time I am not really sure you would acknowledge the fact that private banks do create debt money.


I think your view is a misconception, see below.


Yes it is! No central bank money is created, sure, but debt money is! See below.


I recommend you to watch this series of 6 videos - at least the first 3: 
Then you'll see that the notion that banks just lend out their depositors' money to others is a misconception, as already explained in video  Your view of how the money system works seems to coincide with the 2/3rd of population in video 
The money multiplier model as discussed in OP's linked video and in video  of my linked video series, gives a much better impression of what really happens. This is a decisive step forward to understand because it teaches you that private banks really do create new (debt-!)money!
Video  expands more on this and explains that the "money multiplier" model is more a historical derivation but today's banking system works very different and does not even need the multiple steps of lending and physical cash withdrawal to create new debt money in large quantifies.


Very true if you talk about "central bank money" (= cash + private banks' electronic deposits at the central bank). Very untrue if you talk about debt or credit money, which is, as a matter of fact, naturally being created by private banks.

A long as you pay tx fee, how can you call it pollution? Bitcoin is there for everyone, nobody can control who uses it and what for. Your purpose is not even spam, so fully legit. If you don't use it, others will.
There is no pollution in the sense you think of it.
You cannot keep bitcoin pollution free (acc. to your def. of pollution) unless a central authority audits every single btc tx's purpose and accepts/rejects it.
In lack of such central authority, decision whether Bitcoin tx is legit or not is SOLELY by tx fee. That's how it works, anything else is an illusion. If you restrict yourself artificially, you make life unnecessarily hard for yourself.

Average being 10% below max is virtually "full", because there are always some emptier or even fully empty blocks that pull the average down.
For a serious bet you should use a percentage like 20 or 30% I'd suggest.
OR: Maybe better: You bet that the MEDIAN (not average) of the block size over 8064 blocks after segwit activation is &lt;= 900 kB.

Yes, both has to do with trust. But different kinds of trust. Trusting someone to be able to pay back his debts is something completely different to trusting someone's ledger book keeping entries.
The 2008 crisis and the image diagram you attached was a crisis of the former. It would have been the same if bookkeeping of the credits had been done on a trustless ledger. The reason why it wouldn't have happened with Bitcoin is because Bitcoin's money system does not run on fractional reserves and credits, and not because Bitcoin's ledger is trustless. A trustless ledger for credit money wouldn't help.

hmm, but it seems even bip-62 doesn't cover everything.
Also note that not only wallet sw but also sw at the server side of bitcoin service providers has to be improved.
Maybe, the proposal I explained should be made available for a subset of eligible transactions as "optional" on tx side. So I as a sender and user of a wallet app can choose, for a "standard transaction" to make it "bullet proof" against tx malleability. So I can be 100% sure that I won't have any problems, even if the service provider I am sending bitcoin's to has not yet implemented the proper SW. I as a user will likely be willing to pay the extra tx fee for the extra 65 bytes.
Edit: For the exotic/fancy type of tx: most straight forward, one would add another "normal" input to the (otherwise "exotic") transaction, and use the privkey of that "alibi" input address for the "outer protection" against tx malleability.

*Open Letter to the Author (use google translate to translate):*
Sehr geehrter Herr Holtermann,
mit Befremdung habe ich Ihren Artikel gelesen, der leider ein hohes Maß an Einseitigkeit, Verzerrtheit und subtiler Tendenziösität aufweist.
Sie bringen hier absichtlich die freie Open-Source Währung Bitcoin in einem Atemzug in Verbindung mit dem privatwirtschaftlich groß angelegten kriminellen Ponzi-Scheme "Onecoin", was in etwa so ist, als würden Sie ehrliche Maschinenbauer mit Betrügern in Verbindung bringen, welche (angebliche) Freie-Energie-Maschinen verkaufen.
Das macht offensichtlich, dass es Ihnen nicht auf objektive Berichterstattung ankommt, sondern auf Manipulation der Leserschaft.
Auch wenn Sie versuchen, es subtil zu verstecken, so sollten Sie nicht glauben, Ihre Absichten verschleiern zu können. Der Abgleich Ihrer Formulierungen mit den Fakten spricht Bände. Weitere Beispiele Ihrer tendenziösen Manipulation:


Diese Formulierung "nach einem ERSTEN Höchststand" setzt den Anfang der betrachteten Zeitachse ganz bewusst auf einen Zeitpunkt, von wo an es ca. 1,5 Jahre bergab ging. Welch verzerrten Eindruck Sie damit beim Leser erreichen wollen, ist offensichtlich. Denn bei einer ausgewogenen Berichterstattung müssten Sie erwähnen, dass diesen 1,5 Jahren Abwärtstrend 6,5 Jahre Aufwärtstrend entgegensteht, und außerdem würden Sie nicht lügen, indem Sie suggerieren, dies sei der "ERSTE" Höchststand gewesen. Tatsache ist, dass es vorher weitere "Blasen" gab, am prominentesten Mitte 2011 die Bitcoin-Blase, die den Kurs von 1 USD nach 30 USD trieb, und die Blase Mitte 2013, wo es von 10 auf 200 USD ging. Erst dann die dritte Blase Ende 2013, die von 100 auf über 1000 USD führte. Stets waren die Rückfall-Niveaus nach "Platzen" der Blase höher als die Peaks der jeweils vorangegangenen Blase. Es handelt sich also um einen stabilen Langfrist-Aufwärtstrend mit normalen temporären Markt-Übertreibungen. Dass dies auch fundamental begründet ist aufgrund des zunehmend positiven weltweiten politisch-wirtschaftlichen Umfelds Bitcoin gegenüber (Australien, Japan, Südkorea, Russland, Schweiz, Malta, ...) würde auch für eine ausgewogene Berichterstattung erwähnt werden müssen.


Mit dieser Formulierung ("tendenziell") machen Sie sich lächerlich, indem Sie offenbar zu verniedlichen und kaschieren versuchen, was offensichtlich ist: Einen stabilen langfristigen Aufwärtstrend mit einem Wertzuwachs von +800%,  d.h. einer Verneunfachung (200--&gt;1800) seit Mitte 2015. Unter einem "tendenziell" steigenden Kursanstieg mit hohen Ausschlägen, wie Sie es formulieren, würde man einen Kursverlauf bezeichnen, der nur bei genauerem Hinsehen eine leicht steigende Richtung aufweist, ansonsten aber von Schwankungen dominiert ist, d.h. genau das Gegenteil des tatsächlichen Kursverlaufs, in dem sich die Schwankungen im Vergleich zum Langfrist-Trend als klein darstellen.
Dies als "tendenziell" zu bezeichnen ist erneut nur eines: Manipulativ-TENDENZlÖS!
Sehr geehrter Herr Holtermann, ich weiß nicht, was einen Redakteur dazu bewegt, so unsachlich und manipulativ zu schreiben. Wenn es Druck von Seiten der Chefredaktion ist, sollten Sie sich nach einem anderen Arbeitgeber umschauen und nicht Ihre Seele verkaufen.
Seien Sie sich als Mitarbeiter eines Mainstream-Mediums bitte auch Ihrer gesellschaftlich-politischen Verantwortung bewusst! Denn es ist tendenziöse Redaktionsarbeit wie diese, die zum Zulauf der Parteien am rechten Spektrum führt, das Vertrauen in die Mainstream-Medien untergräbt und die Rufe gegen die "Lügenpresse" der Mainstream-Medien lauter werden lässt. Dies destabilisiert unsere Gesellschaft und bedroht letztlich unseren Frieden! Dabei wäre das Rezept dagegen so einfach:
Einfach nur wirklich EHRLICHE und objektive (d.h. auch umfassende und damit ausgewogene!) Berichterstattung, statt einseitige Faktenauswahl in Kombination mit tendenziösen Formulierungen.
Mit freundlichen Grüßen

We already both agreed that predicting 2036 from 2015 is hardly possible.
What I would like to see is a clear strategy and commitment for block size limit increase with technological growth by default. I.e. if there is no consensus for anything else, I would like to see block size limit increase by default with a growth of bandwidth and storage. Various statistics can be taken for this, for the past and the future. And at the moment, that growth is clearly more than 20% (probably 30%..40% or even 50%) p.a.
What I have big difficulties with is that endless discussions are made without results, and that many important people say that unanimous decisions must be taken, and that, if such unanimity is not reached (and it IS not reached as a matter of fact), we stick with the "DEFAULT" of 0.0% growth. This is going to kill Bitcoin and makes me nervous and a bit angry.

problem: how to know if economic majority (not to be confused with hash power signalling!!) is in favour of uasf before the flag day.
if this problem can be solved (e.g. by some smartly thought out trading of uasf in advance - no future contracts/derivatives), then we have the solution.

you are disgusting since you pretend you don't understand.
They "agreed" on a hardfork that will split the bitcoin network in two with a software that doesn't exist.
It is an attack to Bitcoin and its healthy decentralized eco system.
If they want SegWit, they could equally will just accept it now if they were honest. The toxicity stinks.
@_date: 2017-05-15 09:51:42
then btc is doomed - central miners have taken control, decentralization done.
@_date: 2017-05-15 10:05:40
nobody alienated miners. if segwit activates and btc price quadruples, more miners than before will mine btc for rational reasons, making btc more secure than ever, no matter who called whom toxic before (only difference being that no more a single miner monopolizes the market). they wont stop mining or do harm to btc because someone "alienated" them if that would cost them millions. you are a bit naive with your "emphaty" here at the wrong place.
it's good to be emphatic in general, but if emphaty with your enemy blinds you, you will be shot into your back.
@_date: 2017-05-19 21:35:21
so as I said, more hash power does not mean more security, if both attackers and honest miners have more hashpower.
In the current situation, the hash power of the attacker (i.e. Jihan Wu) grows faster than that of the honest miners, so clearly the network gets increasingly insecure as hashpower grows.

I thought it was noteworthy anyways.
Newspapers like wsj have PLENTY of space and plenty of articles.
In this case it was selected as one out of only 3 or 4 headlines (of which the wheather forecast is always one), i.e. a very small selection. And: The radio is an absolute mainstream radio station, unlike WSJ or economist and alike.
Both together is noteworthy, and I was very surprised hearing it in my own mainstream radio news, where I am not surprised any more reading it in special tech or financial media.

Another and even better way to motivate miners is if at least one exchange start asap, well in advance of uasf flag day, preemptive unbiased underlying token trading (PUTT), as described here:
This may send the non-segwit's market price to near zero well before 1st August.

I would be interested in just ONE attack vector against Trezor stemming from an arbitrarily sophisticated malware on the computer that Trezor connects to. Of course the attack must be such that the user cannot discover it. Maybe I missed something and you'll surprise me, but chances are low.
I expect you will not give a convincing answer because there isn't any, and you will possibly justify your lack of explanation by a personal insult [like my "poor understanding of security threats"] (that's the usual communication pattern if people have no arguments, I don't know you, so I am just talking from experience).

One exchange is enough.
And if the exchange is smart, it can start trading the non-segwit and the bip-148 SegWit token right away - no need to wait till 1st August.
And I mean trading the underlying token itself, not trading any derivative/future financial product. Here's the HowTo for exchanges and its customers/traders:

I could name one person who fits this category (the one who always tries so hard visually moving his mouth properly when he speaks words, and who has a track record of criminal activities before he entered the Bitcoin scene).
I could name another person who sees Bitcoin mining as a sober business, has no ideological/libertarian ideals, and does all that is necessary to maximize his profits, and this guy behaves very rational and not insane at all, but he laughs at the dumb useful idiots who don't get it and believe his lies and even defend him, not knowing how much harm they are doing to Bitcoin and to themselves while defending him.

I did and do use Electrum, even though haven't updated since version 1.7. The mnemonic word list was copy-pastable at that time. Seems it has not changed.
If it is copy-pastable, it is of little value. Most users take the convenient way, this is just "human" nature. Hardly anybody will write down word by word on paper and then retype it word by word, if he can just copy-paste.
This is a flaw in the SECURITY CONCEPT, and as I said, it should be closed, especially as more and more less tech-savvy users enter the Bitcoin space. Blaming "the dumb users" is not the right way. Such arrogant behaviour of the intelligent superior tech-savvy minority over the stupid masses will not pull the dumb masses into Bitcoin.

with 7 million users every user can make about 10 bitcoin transactions per year, this would already exhaust bitcoin's today's capacity. 2 Million users hence imply about 3 transactions per user per month. That's not a lot, so claiming today's Bitcoin can accomodate 2 Million users is already optimistic.

* consoring certain content based on the assumption that the censorer knows better what is best for Bitcoin.
* coercing one's opinion on others in a subtle way by misusing sub-reddit privileges.
* stretching the truth by calling an altcoin what is actually a software fork with protocol modifications.

your definition of r/l is restricted. also intangible things are real. thats the root cause for the misunderstanding many have.

I didn't know. But everyone knows what is meant, so if you don't want to call it "market cap", call it "total market value" or whatever you think is suitable.
Anyway thanks for the language lesson.
***Edit*** *: Our friends from "Gold, man, sucks" say:*
*"For commodities, there is no direct counterpart to market capitalization. The problem is that commodities, and the related price risks, are held in a variety of ways – long futures positions, over-the-counter investments, long term fixed-price purchasing contracts, physical inventory at the producer, etc. – making a complete accounting of capital dedicated to holding commodities from the time they are produced to the time they are consumed infeasible."*
So the reason for not applying the term "market cap" to commodities is not because they are not shares of a company, but for the reasons given above: It is simply not easily possible for a commodity to determine its total value (capitalization) on the markets, i.e. the "market capitalization", so the term is not easily applicable.
In contrast, Bitcoin units are fungible and denumerable like shares, and it is known exactly how many shares or bitcoins are in existence at any point in time. So there is a lot in common between company shares and bitcoins, in that in both cases the total value can be exactly quantified. So it seems all but far-fetched to talk about the "market cap" of Bitcoin (or bitcoins), and it is commonly used in this sense by many, if not most, people. Nobody is suggesting that Bitcoin is a company when using the expression "Bitcoin Market Cap".
So there is no point in pedantically insisting on the original meaning of "Market Cap" and claiming that Bitcoin has no market cap, except one wants to teach someone a lesson without deeper purpose.
Generally, in languages, meanings of terms evolve acc. to what is practical, and hence acc. to common usage of words and terms. The term "Market Cap" has evolved historically as a term only applicable to company shares because of the nature of assets. For currencies, the equivalent term is "money supply (e.g. M0)", for commodities like gold one simply talks about the "total value of", and crypto-currencies still are a new phenomenon with a short history.
The community has (intuitively or wittingly) grasped the above mentioned commonalities between company shares and bitcoins when it comes to expressing the total value, and hence has naturally applied the term "Market Cap" to bitcoins as well. Today we can read it everywhere, and nobody thinks that Bitcoin is a company because of that.
We can consider that as the EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. What you consider wrong today, is already common use today, and will be officially correct tomorrow.
I dare to predict that soon we will read in text books and encyclopedias that the term "Market Cap" applies to company shares AND crypto-currencies with a defined money supply, whereas for the latter the term is used interchangeably with "money supply".
Hope I could teach you a little lesson back, we all learn from each other.

typical example for the "tragedy of the commons":
- short term, miner would be best-off with "100% highest fee" strategy. Especially if the miner represents only a small minority of hash power, its effect on the bitcoin eco-system as a whole would be negligible if he behaved otherwise, so why should *he* be the altruistic one?
- long-term, it would be best if all miners used the "highest-fee but bumping with age" for the 10% (as you explained).
There are such tragedy of the commons conflicts also with some (not all) blocksize proposals - one can find it very often...

That's ~~certainly~~ *possibly* true, strictly speaking.


Extremely unlikely, see below.


Pointers serve a purpose. Malleability serves no useful purpose but avoids useful porposes.


Yes, but certain **killer features** might be prevented with tx malleability.
As far as I can see, there are nice things you can do if there is NO tx malleability, whereas I cannot imagine a single useful use-case that builts on tx malleability.
Hence, to my understanding, removing tx malleability not only removes the pitfalls of lazy programmed wallets and server software but also enables (not disables) features that are otherwise impossible.
Edit 1: Apparently, "**payment channels**" are requiring a system free of transaction malleability " So malleability is really something harmful, not something that contains some sort of hidden feature of any kind.
Edit 2: This useful feature being  more generally: you can build certain transactions on top of an own 0-conf transaction (or even a chain of TXs) and can be sure they they will be valid, because you can be sure the 0-conf TX will not be "double-spent" (in the sense of "invalidated" by tx malleability).

if another coin has all the positive properties of bitcoin plus more utility(!)

That's a no brainer. if you stick to gold here it's a fail, because the analogy stops here. gold has always different and advantegeous technological properties vs. silver.

"worse" by what measures? Worse in absolute $ is irrelevant due to inflation.
"worse" in percent of GDP - yes, I agree. BUT: As interest levels decrease, the debt burden gets decreased, i.e. for a higher debt in % of GDP the debt burden in % of GDP remains constant.
The long term trend is getting more an more in this direction - more and more arbitrarily negative interest rates (of course after removing cash altogether), and this way it can continue forever.

Hi my favorit troll.
Jihan earns millions each month that he postpones segwit and asic boost blocking, how to TALK to him then?
It is his plain economical interest and he puts plenty of money to postpone segwit as long as possible. Even if Bitcoin was worth 10 times more with segwit, it does not pay off for him. His incentives are clearly against the community's interest.
He must not be asked anyway. The community determines what it considers bitcoin, and it is clear the community wants segwit almost unanimously. He shall mine or fuck off. He shall make money that he deserves from mining, but he shall not fool the community. end of message.

You mean "WTF is Vertcoin?" - Well, it is a Litecoin clone with the following differences:
- founded in 2014
- PoW algo optimized for CPU/GPU and ASIC freeness
- Coin comitted to be ASIC-free - has hardforked already successfully to remain ASIC-free
- Community/users appreciate ASIC-freeness
- Modified, more flexible/reactive difficulty adjustment algorithm
- Support of (optional) stealth addresses
What it has in common with Litecoin:
- No pre-mine, no instamine, i.e. a fair coin distribution.
- Same coin distribution schedule. 
EDIT: The only drawback of Vertcoin is in fact its first three letters! (but that's just coincidental - vert means green)

Do you know products in the supermarket where kids need to collect points to get some bonus? Do you know products for kids in the supermarket where kids have a 1:100000 chance (=Lottery) to win some cool stuff like a bike, a kite, or whatever. THAT is a lottery for kids, and it is totally legal. There the kids really have to buy something, spend money to get the "lottery ticket". And the marketing people of these products know it and exploit this kids' psychology.

exactly, there might be other attack vectors than those listed in bip62, and even for those, not all cases get solved.
So two possibilities to solve:
(a) betterSW for wallets AND servers.
(b) enhance protocol by an (optional or mandatory - to be discussed) additional protection layer/encapsulation to put any tx inside, to make it 100% bullet proof against tx malleability.
Note that (b) only means that the "outer signature" needs to avoid that "lower s value" ambiguity - that's all.
Note for (b) you reuse one privkey of the inputs to generate the protective "outer" signature. If the tx is so exotic that it does not have an input that requires a privkey, just modify the tx to add another input (which can also be the change address) whose privkey is then used for the outer signature (or decide to forgo the outer protection for this transaction).

If Bitcoin capacity remains at 3 TPS forever, it means that if 7 Billion people use Bitcoin, everybody can make one transaction *once* in 100(!) years, on average. This does not even include machine-to-machine payments or business transactions.
If Bitcoin stays at 3 TPS forever (if !) AND there is a significantly increasing demand for crypto-currencies in the world, it is a no-brainer that another crypto-currencies will take over Bitcoin's eco-system.

I think they are not this dumb. simple math renders this argument invalid.
true reason is asicboost.
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:57:18
blocks are empty when miners have not yet verified previous block, hence hash for empty block for a while to avoid wasting time. hence statistically certain percentage of empty blocks is never avoidable.
THIS mechanism is independent of asicboost.
Asicboost is harmful enough without the "empty block" argument.

your description is (almost) correct, and useful, thanks, but the last part is still wrong - it falls again to the fallacy that a 51% hashrate can enforce a hard fork (incompatible protocol change), which it can't:


not true! with the new SegWit ruleset in place and accepted, reverting to pre-segwit is exactly what is called a hard fork. even if 90% of miners and nodes hard-forked this way, it would have no relevance, because these blocks would violate the consensus rules and would hence **not be accepted by the market participants!!!**
The economic activity would take place within the remaining 10% of nodes and miners, while the other 90% of miners could not sell their newly mined coins to anyone (except amongst themselves maybe) because the market users would not attribute any value to them!!!
I always see the same fallacy in these discussions: People just look at miners and nodes and forget the actually strongest force of all, which is the MARKET, i.e. those who actually BUY the coins from the miners!

Whoever launches this transaction malleability "attack" to the network these hours does Bitcoin a big favour!
Because we better see the problems now than when Bitcoin has become more mainstream. We see that this malleability causes big troubles amongst not only wallet end-users but also bitcoin service companies. Also "spend from zero-confirmation tx" is an unusable feature now.
It should force the developers to launch a protocol update that makes transaction signatures immune to tx malleability by simply reorganizing the tx signature to cover the COMPLETE transaction string.

That's the old paradigm, that stopped working with asicboost. Sorry you don't understand it. Asicboosts exactly removes this principle. That's why it must be abandoned. I suppose you are a paid shill for Jihan, so it's your right to try propaganda here.


Now you are trolling big time!!! Jihan is not blocking segwit and ALL his statements make clear he is agianst it.


Exactly. Jihan controls mining, nothing new.


It is rejected by Juihan because of ASIC BOOST, and some stupid idiots thing he does it because he prefers bigger blocks (which if he really menat it, the first thing to do is to signal segwit).

Note that cash is closer to Bitcoin than VISA/Mastercard, so a ban of cash (which ironically would equate to a ban of legal tender currently) would be the exactly wrong direction for Bitcoin!

if really 30% initially mine bip148 from the start, then bip 148 is bound to succeed.
30% is enough to make bip 148 chain usable from the start. economic majority will give more value to the chain that has more prospects for the future and will not mine on the chain that can get orphaned away. In this awareness, more old-chain miners get cold feet and better start mining on bip148 chain. Also bip148 coins are valued more, pulling more miners to bip148 chain for economical reasons. In no time old chain does get orphaned away, and the rest is history.
Needless to say that price will boost incredibly if this happens, since bitcoin has proven to be truely decentralized and independent even from the most powerful industry cartels. But this is only a side effect.

His language is full of hate - how can you say he is less likely to start a war than Hillary? If you know the rhetoric of Hitler before he came into power, and then see what he did when he had the power, you know what to expect from Trump. Of course he has not YET started war - he is not YET in power to do so.
Trump is a psychopath who hates people, lacks any respect especially for people who he thinks are inferior to him (i.e. everybody), is highly egocentric and has no empathy.

No!!! Ledger wallet is prone to computer malware, while Trezor is not.
So don't use ledger wallet if you are serious about security.
If you have an old smartphone (iOS or Android) you can use Bither as offline storage. This alternative should be safer than Ledger Wallet.
You can also use an offline computer where you install electrum, and store bitcoins offline that way (but still bears the risk of getting an infection from the USB stick, so I consider Bither safer even).

Hard to tell. ethereum has a leap ehead by their industry contacts. But the industry is young and nothing is lost. RSK could have an advantage because it is backed by a better decentralized and more immutable backbone, which is Bitcoin. So on the long run RSK could win. Just my private guess.

As usual, Jimmy Song is wrong when he talks about UASF and the role of exchanges, obviously he makes anti uasf propaganda for some (?!) reasons. Quote (with my comments):


sure - more accurately, when supporting WITHDRAWAL of tokens of both chains after 1 Aug, they need replay protection, which is easy to achieve for an exchange.


nonesense. It can well happen as long as both chains exist, ie when the uasf chain is shorter. This does not at all preclude a later reorg of the old chain by uasf chain overtaking legacy chain. (note that such reorg would imply loss for those users holding legacy-chain coins [on the exchange or outside] but would not cause any loss to the exchange itself!)


nonesense, see above. on the contrary, if users give more value to uasf chain on the exchanges, miners will quickly switch to uasf chain and make the other chain reorg (= disappear).


No. No need for futures. trading the underlying directly is well possible, even before 1 Aug by the way, and it is described [here](  ).


wrong, see above.


Trading the underlying as described above does not require exchanges to "lock up" the bitcoins until the end of "the duration of the whole drama". Instead, they can be treated (incl withdrawal and loading) like any other coin on the exchange.

Attack vector against ledger nano or ledger hw.1:
In brief: computer malware manipulates what is displayed on computer screen, thereby the user acknowledges a transfer that is not the one that s/he thinks it is. HW wallet will hence sign the wrong transaction, sending funds to the attacker.
This attack vector is possible as long as there is no display on the HW wallet showing the TX output on the HW wallet's display, plus a HW button on the HW wallet to authorize the signing of the transaction.
Mechanisms like the ledger's security card can make the attack more difficult but cannot fully make it impossible. Some say, use a safe guaranteed malware-free offline computer for signing transactions with hw wallet. Ok, that's possible, but then you can equally well use the offline computer itself as the hw wallet (e.g. with Electrum) and do not need an extra stage.
*Edit: I did not claim that "Nano is not secure compared to a Ledger" (I do not even understand the sense of that sentence). I did claim that the HW wallets "ledger nano" and "ledger hw.1" are not secure against computer malware.*

PS: Personally, I consider the social aspect as predominant over the technocratic aspect, knowing that Bitcoin is a social system run by real people, and hence I consider it utmost dangerous to keep by the 1MB dogma, which is an artificial one, technically imposed by historic accident, not by social contract. It should be relaxed by the free market within the limits of what makes sense technically, socially and economically. Artificially defining this parameter as constant is a breach of contract and a divider of the community.
Having said that, it should be a no-brainer that other protocol enhancements and scaling solutions should be worked on without any less urgency than before.

since SegWit is in place, these coins are as safe as any other coins and could now only be stolen by a protocol hardfork that allows stealing coin (and certainly such a HF would be so contentious that no community would agreevwith it).
The sole question of yours proves that it is a VERY good idea, because otherwise the FUD remains in the heads of the people that SegWit transactions might be less secure!

improving the protocol and/or the wallet and server SW before greater harm will be caused from these pitfalls at a later point in time.
I compare it to the load stress test that triggered wallet makers to include adaptive tx fees as a basic feature, which makes absolutely sense for a sustainable eco-system but needed a trigger to have it in the SW.

core has hf with on-chain blocksize increase well on its roadmap, but not after first making other modifications (SegWit being the first of it)  to make bitcoin more efficient and help decentralization.
if you deny this, you are either not informed or manipulative with bad intentions.
reversing the order, i.e. first blocksize increase, then other improvements, would harm decentralization and be a very bad decision. only the uninformed, or the ones having bad intentions for bitcoin, would want it this way (or ppl having private financial interests like Jihan with asicboost).

ok, thanks for noting the difference.
still, I do not understand the purpose of RBF in the first place - maybe you can explain, because you seem to be knowledgeable.
If it is about getting transaction with too little TxFee "unstuck", it would be enough to apply a restricted RBF that only raises the fee. But implementing FULL RBF means "throwing out the child with the bath water". (and by the way, "child pays for parent" would also solve the "stuck tx problem", note cpfp can be applied by receipient and sender as well (the latter by spending from change address).
So the only reason to implement support of Full RBF is to EASE REAL DOUBLE SPEND. What's the (non-fraudulent) use case for this?

Thanks for this spreadsheet - nice!
But there is a little error in your spreadsheet - actually there are two errors at the same place:
* You used the Formula 1 MB = 102**8**^2 bytes, probably you wanted to write 102**4**^2 bytes.
* But according to standard units 1 MB equals exactly 1,000,000 bytes. This is also the case in current Bitcoin block size limit - it is 1,000,000 bytes and not 1024 x 1024 bytes. Note: The latter would be called a "Mebibyte" and is abbreviated "MiB" instead of "MB".
"M" means "Mega" and is used for all standard units, whether gramm, meters or bytes. The notion that "M"=1024x1024 is obsolete, that's what "Mi" ("Mebi") is now for.

Now I have some news for you:
I just created a *parallel universe*, the "TONAL UNIVERSE"!!! It shares the same atoms and neutrinos as the legacy universe, but all physical metrics like lengths, time, capacity, weight, power, temperature etc. are measured in Tonal units in this parallel universe!
The Tonal universe is completely compatible with the legacy universe: if you move any atom or photon or neutrino in the legacy universe, it will also move in the Tonal universe, and vice-versa. Also any quantum fluctuation is identical in both universes.
The **TONAL UNIVERSE** is also notably the first parallel universe ever, having been discovered and created in 2015 March.
Kind regards

Hopefully, and expectedly, nothing! that's why I think BIP-148 will succeed, and this will show that the power is amongst the users, not the miners.
But the reason why is only indirectly the amount of transactions taking place on the blockchain. The more direct reason is that no user will pay anything (will give any value) for Bitcoins of a non-progressive miner cabal-controlled centralized "shitchain", but instead users value the original properties of Bitcoin, of which decentralization is paramount.
We are very close, but not exactly aligned. I want to pointout that e.g. miners (or whoever) could generate plenty of (fake) transactions on the old non-segwit chain after 1 Aug, so this chain would look very busy after 1 Aug and would look very "used". But this alone does not help. IF nobody of the REAL users use this chain, this does not help these cartel miners. Because in the end these miners want that users BUY their coins, i.e. pay for them, only then their business works.

That's about loans between banks.
Usually, banks loan excess money that they don't need to satisfy their fractional reserve requirements to other banks, because they get more interest there instead of depositing the excess money at the central bank. Similarly, for the borrowing bank it is cheaper to loan from another private bank than from the central bank.
But after the credit crisis of 2008, banks did not trust each other any more that they would get back their loans, so they stopped lending to each other.
It is not the permissioned trusted ledger that failed, it is rather the credit money system that failed.

Segwit+2MB delays it further - unnecessarily. We'll have SegWit on 1 August instead!
Jihan knows the only way to avoid it on 1st Aug already is to promise SegWit for a LATER (and yet undefined - no SW available yet, let alone tested!) point in time, and saving his face by bundling it with the 2MB so that it looks different. He knows full well that segwit cannot be avoided in the end, so he tries to postpone it as long as possible with this move. Do you really think he would have done this move without the UASF threat for him?!
It is quite easy too see through his manoeuvre, but some people (maybe you, if you are not a troll paid by Jihan or Roger) still succumb to his dumb propaganda. Jihan does sober economic business decisions in his best own interests.
We have all right to act in the best interests of OURSELVES, the BITCOIN USERS, there is no need at all to lick Jihan's ass - if anything, we shall kick it.

I'd hope so, but as long as he has an almost-monopol and competitive advantage, the central one (i.e. AB-Jihan) will not run out of money but accumulate more and more. So the comparison to the USSR doesn't work, because in capitalism a central monopoly gets ever richer and destroys the competitors in an unregulated market, wheras in sovjet times the central government has separated its country from progress.
As always, both extremes are subobtimum. Always, regulation machanisms are needed to prevent monopols and establish balance of powers.

Of course Trezor can be "attacked" if the user is not paying attention before pressing "ok". But if the user is cautious, s/he will only let Trezor sign a transaction with AMOUNT and TX_OUTPUT ADDRESS  being what s/he wants. AMOUNT and TX_OUTPUT are displayed on Trezor's screen and the user has to confirm by pressing a Trezor HW button, so everything happens on Trezor HW, isolated and protected from the arbitrarily infected computer. So as long as Trezor HW/SW was not changed, no computer malware in the world could possibly attack Trezor without the user's notice, in other words the Trezor security concept is 100% bullet-proof (except for Trezor HW modifications or Trezor SW modifications stealing Trezor manufacturer's master key).
On the other hand, Ledger HW wallet (nano or HW.1) is insecure by design, you cannot talk it away. You use a computer SW GUI to build your transaction. The (corrupted) computer SW sends the (arbitrarily modified) transaction to Ledger HW wallet for signing. HW Leder will ask for confirmation of the (modified) TX (because HW wallet cannot know that it is a modified one). The (corrupted) computer SW receives this transaction data and displays the (re-modified) TX data (which now looks again like the one the user had originally entered), the user will confirm it, the Ledger HW wallet will sign the (modified) TX and the computer broadcasts it to the bitcoin network via the (possibly corrupted) bitcoin client SW running on the (infected) computer.


This is an option. What I wrote above is about the "default" operational mode of Ledger.
About this optional "Security Card User validation" mode: This appears to be improved, but the malware can learn the card's layout after several uses, and Ledger writes themselves in above link that "user validation method should be used with caution" for good reason. It is also questionable if the user will cautiously compare the random indexes of the address - it is much more error-prone then verifying the complete address printed on Trezor's screen at a glance. And the printing of a new card is not secure at all - the computer that prints the new card can be infected by malware, so the new printed card is even less secure than the old one! Another attack vector is that the malware tries so often until a substantial share of the used address indexes between wrong and right TX output address are identical, so that the user won't or can't realize the attack.
The note in above link saying "Devices offering a screen and buttons do not support this validation mode" is phrased like those devices have a disadvantage. But of course those devices (like Trezor) do not support it because they don't NEED to! You don't need a swimming ring if you travel by car many kilometers away from the water.
The "Security Card User validation mode" is just a workaround to make an incomplete security concept a bit more secure, but it can never match the bullet-proof concept of Trezor. Everyone should know and understand that. You cannot talk it away, however you turn and twist it. You can only add security layers like the Security Card, to make attacks more difficult (or make the attack vector more difficult to understand by the user), but you cannot make an inherently insecure system secure by adding such layers.
It is interesting to see that Ledger tries to let Ledger appear equally safe as Trezor. This by itself is really bad and not encouraging. They should be honest and omit that the lower purchasing price compared to Trezor comes with a conceptual security gap.
If I had to secure several thousands of Euros in Bitcoins, I would never safe 50-70 Euros by purchasing Ledger instead of Trezor.

After the allegations against his person started because he did not publish a simple valid cryptographically signed statement, he says he is "not strong enough".
Of course, if he really were Satoshi, he could stop all those allegations immediately by providing exactly this simple signature.
But he decides for damaging himself forever instead of simply providing the proof, and he *is* strong enough to stand the now everlasting alegations that he is a liar.
This is a sick "logic" and doesn't sound like Satoshi at all.

And also LN inventors say we need enventually 200-300 MB blocksize to properly accomodate Lightning Network for worldwide adoption. And also Bitcoin Core roadmap includes this step, and they are seriously working on that.
But each at the right time. First Bitcoin protocol needs to be optimized, and SegWit is the first step for this, further steps building on this shall follow, and all this shall make Bitcoin more efficient and help maintains its key value, which is decentralization. Then, if these efficiency optimization steps are used, a hard fork will in all certainty be a logical step as will, and nobody knowledgable seriously denies this. If people think core wants "1 MB forever" they fell victim of the rBTC propaganda (and I used to fall for this, too, until about 1 yr ago, and I am not ashamed for this - I just did not spend enough time to make the proper research at that time).

how would you measure the "support". Assuming 90% miner support equals 90% support of the economy would be a fallacy of course.
But even then - the 10% would continue mining 1MB-coin, and then we have a network split and 2 bitcoins. I don't see how this shall be avoided. I think the 2-bitcoin-scenario will be a certainty, because there are too many people who are stritcly against a hard-fork (not me), they will continue mining and bying and using 1MB-coin.
With an UASF, this risk is much lower, because the UASF chain is going to technically "eat up" the other chain, so it is likely that all the economy will go for the UASF chain from the beginning.

Why not making it as simple as the following:
Let "A" denote today's transaction string.
Let "PR" be the private key of one of the input addresses of "A".
Let "sig(X, Y)" denote the signature of X with priv.key Y.
Let B=concatenation(A, sig(A,PR)) be a new string that consists of today's tx string plus that string signed by the sender.
If B is sent to the network, it cannot possibly be modified by malleability.
*Edit: Acc. to web sources, typical tx is 250 bytes long and signature is 65 bytes long, so overhead would be limited. And above solution just explains the principle and could probably still be optimized, because A itself already contains signatures...*

There is one mistake that can be read in almost all articles and posts about cpfp:
The erroneous notion that cpfp can only be used by the receiver of a tx. The truth is it can equally well be used by the sender, except in the special case that the change is zero.
Also what I am missing all the time is a list of wallets that support cpfp (with info whethet it supports rx side, tx side, or both kinds of cpfp). Without such practical real life info, the cpfp knowledge is of purely theoretical nature and of no practical use for the reader.

well, every central exchange os not trustless.

It is no future or bet trading with certain condition, but really economically the same as trading the underlying.


That applies *equally well* (no more and no less) when you trade the tokens after 1 Aug. On any market, traders also consider "what will the other trader do?", but *in the end* it all comes down to fundamental valuation of the underlying.
That's why I like this trading option so much - it solves the dilemma that otherwise we will not know what the markets demand before 1 Aug.

Yes. In the end the masses, the people decide, irrespective of strict scientific/technocratic judgement.
It is a similar thing in languages in general: People say wrong things grammatically(*), but after a while (10-20 years) of continuous use it must be accepted as a reality, even if grammatically incorrect, and eventually it will be considered "correct" language in the school books. That's how language evolves. I observe it in my mohter tongue (German).
The use of the term "bits" for "µBTC" is quite the same kind of development.
(*) Examples (for the German readers):
- Weil besser ist das (korrekt: "Weil das besser ist")
- Sie hat mir zugewunken (korrekt: zuge*winkt*)
- Das macht keinen Sinn (korrekt: "Das *ergibt* keinen Sinn")
- Die AGBs (korrekt: "Die AGB" [Plural ohne "s" - "Bedingungen", nicht "Bedingungs"])
- Peter's Auto (korrekt: "*Peters* Auto" - der Genitiv-Apostroph ist Englisch, nicht Deutsch)
- [list could be continued endlessly]
Personally, I have real troubles with all of the above in German language, but even me I have no objections against "bits" for "µBTC" at all.

Thanks to the current "malleability attack" and the discussions here, and inspired by the "[Joystream]( software, I educated myself about payment channels and lightning network (recommended reads for "Lightning Network beginners" with an otherwise sound Bitcoin background: [Rusty's blog]( and [Lightning Network]( web site (video, presentations, ...)).
Now I start seeing the fascinating possibilities and chances of this, and I am hoping even more than before that the TX malleability fixes as well as the Bitcoin protocol enhancements are incorporated into Bitcoin soon, as needed to make Lightning live up to its full potential.
This will not only pave the way for mass adoption and scaling, it will also, as an inevitable side effect, boost Bitcoin price significantly, because Bitcoins are "locked" in the channels for some time with the lightning network mechanisms.

If 1.5 Million people have "adopted" bitcoin, everyone of these "adopters" can perform one transaction per week on the Bitcoin blockchain. That's the current practical capacity limit of the Bitcoin network. (of course off-blockchain transactions like changtip tipping or coinbase-to-coinbase transfers give additional capacity).
Of course there are plans already amongst the lead developers to scale up the Bitcoin capacity.
But anyway, I am not sure how fast exactly adoption should be.

There must be a catch, or many. Dash mainstream superficial marketing is definitely hiding away something. Big P&amp;D.
Also Dash's homepage (which has a grammatical error already in the introductory text) only lists some nice-sounding buzzwords without explaining what's behind.

I suggest merging Vertcoin's cpu/gpu centric POW into Bitcoin and thereby create a true people's Bitcoin. Moreover:
- add a tiny detail in tx format (e.g. change irder if sone bits) to make tx incompatible to prevent cross-chain replays.
- change default address formats (e.g. by prefixing each address with a "B", or by replacing the leading 1 and 3 by 2 and 4) to avoid address confusion resulting in user dissatisfaction.
- add a social agreement commiting to change the mining algo in certain time intervals to avoid an asic eco system evolve.

hi troll, you dont (want to) understand SegWit is more than blocksize increase, it's also a proper LN enabler which is more important than on-chain scaling AT THE MOMENT.

There are phantasies of enforcing new protocol rules (HF) by miners and attack the chain sticking to old rules. That way miners would (try to) enforce new protocol rules.
@_date: 2017-05-14 21:51:00
Thats about mining with given rules. For realizing soft fork protocol improvement, nakamoto consensus is irrelevant. All that counts is what the market demands and pays money for, and miners will mine what the market wants, if they are rationale.
Jihan trolls and shills here want to make us believe that miners determine the way to go but that is obviously false.
It is like in real life: 10 companies produce product A. Suddenly some people say we like B. One conpany produces B. Now all people buy B, and nobody buys A any more. The conservative producers of A do not understand, they thought they determine what consumers buy from them, but they are proven wrong. They now have two choise: keep on producing A and go bankrupt, or produce B as well and take a fraction of the cake.

imo, 420 GB/year is ok, it means you buy a big hdd today and are good for ca. 15 years. In 15 years you'll buy another HDD that's good for the rest of your life.
the main problem I see with HF today(!) is it is so controversial that it is 100% for sure to cause a chain split as big fractions of the market are against it.
that must be avoided, that's why I am against HF in 2017. first the other techniques like segwit, schnorr etc. must get into the protocol to make it more efficient w.r.t. user per MB of block size. eventually, I am pro HF *then*, as last resort, and then agreement will be much higher.

You need to educate yourself about how fiat money (credit money) comes into existence. Then you know the answer.
Hint: Credit money is created electronically by private banks by creating credits. Governments today do not "print" money, neither physically nor electronically. Although both mechanisms appear "equivalent" to the layman and popular opinion, the mechanism is fundamentally different.
*Edit: A good 101 on this is [this series of videos]( Although the videos were created for the Bank of England, they are similarly valid for all central banks, except the small (but practically not all that important) difference that the fractional reserve ratio is 1% or 10% in EUR or USA/USD compared to 0% for UK/GBP.*

For defense only, they can let the patent EXPIRE instead of prolongong it fir (max.) 20 years. This makes the patent's contents prior art, so nobody else can patent it.
other advantage: blockstream saves yearly patent fees.
if blockstream does not let it expire, my conclusion is they want to reserve the possibility to use it in non-defensive way.

I mistyped it - I meant "nodes" of course, not "miners". I fixed it.
The 100GB argument is arbitrary.
With that argument you can also give reason my we should immediately switch to 0 MB blocks, because there is a node who runs out of HDD space right now due to the ever-increasing block size, and if it keeps on increasing, this node has to switch off.
Of course this is nonsense.
So where do you draw the line? Which hobby miners or nodes should be ok to switch off, which should be maintained? Clearly there is no clear black and white answer.
The user made a good differentiated view saying 1MB is not magical and the optimum might be elsewhere, and your point about the "free-loaders" might also be worth a consideration.
The conclusion is difficult, because one has to take all theses points seriously into consideration in one's evaluation.

Of course every individuual has other reasons why to refer to satoshi (note also small blockers did, using faked satoshi emails from a hacked account).
There are many very good arguments to evolve block size limit (instead of stall), and they have been explained plenty of times.

Why not restricting the max size of any (non-segwit) TX to 1MB (or even 500kB or 300 kB or 100kB!), irrespective of any (future) block size limit. As a simple softfork, and we are done. Simple and clean.

I agree Lightning needs larger blocks, and I am looking forward to lightning.
Unfortunately, many people say greater blocks are not needed because of Lightning. Maybe these are just trolls and not the Lightning people themselves. But then Lightning people should be louder in articulating the need for block size increase, and I cannot see this. Some Lightning people (I think the lightning inventors actually - see the video on the Lightning homepage) name 133 MB as a needed block size for Lightning, which I consider reasonable acc. to my own calculations.


*"why do we need a default growth rate?"* --&gt; serious question? I thought this is a no-brainer. You mentioned yourself technological growth (even if you seem to expect only a factor of about 8 in 21 years if I understand you right). Then people talk about growth rates, it is no *"desperation for growth"*, it is usually (and hopefully) the realistic projection of future technological evolution.
By the way, also **BIP100** has a default growth rate! It happens to be 0.0%, and because the number is zero, nobody seems to take notice of it. But as a matter of fact, **BIP-100** has a default growth rate of 0.0%, this cannot be talked away, and I do not consider this wise. I could ask where this "desperation" for default growth rate of 0.0% comes from and what justifies exactly this value. The explanatory section of **BIP-100.5** explains the situation very nicely and vividly - the bathtub curve of centralization. I think everybody should understand and accept these basics before discussing block sizes.
*"let miners decide how much space they want to supply"* --&gt; this is in common between **BIP100** and **BIP100.5**. The difference is that **BIP100** has a default growth rate of 0.0% (maybe in the expectation of 0.0% technological growth? Or due to another hidden agenda?) while **BIP-100.5** takes a pragmatic approach of 32% p.a., based on common projections and evolutions in the past. Both have in common that miners can deviate from the default growth rate. The difference is that **BIP100** needs an 80% majority to deviate from the 0.0% growth, which produces a very strong bias towards 0.0% (implying that 0.0% is the best "default" guess for future evolution, which I consider absurd). On the other hand, **BIP-100.5** allows to deviate from its default with much smaller majorities than 80%. Already 55% is enough to reduce of increase a little bit from the default, and the greater the majority is, the more the growth can deviate from the default. For example. if really a 70% majority thinks that the block size should not grow at all, this is possible with BIP-100.5. I consider this a wonderful approach.

true, in theory not, because u can still mine old blocks.
but after segwit is mainstream, miners who only include non-sw-txs into their blocks, even if it means forgoing revenues from tx fees, would only do it for AB reasons. So while formally it is still "covert", de facto it is not, because the true motives would be obvious.

this is part of the reality of a decentralized crypto with increased adoption.
I think wallet sw needs to rethink its strategy for change money into new address, and need to weigh privacy vs. avoidance of dust in the wallet.
Even with SegWit and even with a later blocksize increase, we'll have to face this problem as adoption keeps on growing.
meanwhile, i'd encourage my friends new to crypto to use coinomi wallet and use litecoin as a pragmatic approach.

Up to a certain point, yes. However - and this is the most interesting and fun(ny) fact of all, if ALL (or almost all) traders in a stock used TA, then TA would NOT work - just as it would not work if nobody traded TA.
Why? Well, if ALL traded TA, ALL would "know" that the chart would climb again up after falling to the resistence level. So in expectation of that, everyone would wait till the chart hits the resistence level, and then buy, to get the cheapest possible price. But evidently, as EVERYBODY trades this way, it is wise not to wait until the very last moment when everybody buys, because the market volume is too thin. It is better, and safer, to buy already a little bit earlier, before the prices hits the resistance. Etc. So as a result, the prices would never hit the resistence but go up well in advance.
Funnily, the whole thing is self regulating: As the prices goes up earlier and does not hit the resistence, some traders start to doubt that TA really works - so it is no more 100% of traders believing in TA. And well! Next time, the prices does hit the resistence again.
So TA works because there is a sufficiently high fraction of traders that DO believe in TA (and act accordingly), AND(!) a sufficiently high fraction of traders that do NOT believe in TA (and hence do not act acc. to TA). So funny! :-D But true!
So in the end, TA is psychology more than anything else. And, of course, how can it be anything else?

it is sufficient if ONE exchange will activate and a handful (maybe 10%) of miners. Then people start trading "old coin" and uasf coin, and after a short time the situation is settled and all the world is working on uasf chain. This comes from the properties of the SF, so everyone owning "old coins" risks to lose all, as explained [here]( so everyone will try to get rid of "oldcoins" asap on this exchange, pressing oldcoin prices dowm, and incentivising rational minets to switch mining uasf coins.
The sole UNDERSTANDING of this mechanism will probably cause ALL major exchanges to trade uasf coins from 1st activation day onwards, as soon as ONE of them is announcing to do so. Some may not even take the effort to trade both and trade uasf chain only from activation day onwards. So de-facto the old-chain has no chance at all!
The only way "old-chain" could survive technically is by hard-forking, but who in the marketplace would want a HF? What benefit would it have over the progressive SegWit enabled sf chain? None!

you don't need blocks mined to trade. as i explained in the link.
if bip 148 price reaches a certain level, miners will follow accordingly if they are economically rational. mining hashrate will hence correspond to market valuation, that's an economical necessity.

In the full hour news they have 3 or 4 main "headlines" (news ticker). It usually goes as follows:
1. Overview section: The news speaker reads the 3 or 4 headlines - one very short sentence per topic.
2. Then the news speaker elaborates on each of the headlines a little bit, one after another.
In section 1, the headline was simply saying something very brief like: "Swiss town of Zug now accepts Bitcoin".
In section 2, it was explained in a little more detail, saying something like...: "...the digital currency Bitcoin... ...reason is to show that Zug is modern and a leader in innovations of the financial industry..." or something along these lines (I am quoting from my memory).

Of course they would also change the block time from 10min to 10sec, "no problem"...
Indeed, LN could do all this much better, "but I don't like the faces of those LN inventors and proponents, and these people are much smarter than me, which is so unfair, Eric for example was so mean to me in [this scaling debate]( by simply telling the truth and the technical facts in such an unfair (because technically correct) manner, how mean, and therefore I must be against all that comes from these people, no matter how right it is, and no matter how messed up I am in my brain"...

no, lieferando.de bought (= acquired, took over) lieferservice.de.

The logical step.
But even better: Since you usually do not want to play with real money, just play on Bitcoin Testnet, and directly on-chain (because then the TX fees do not matter anyway!). Every player loads his/her Testnet wallet with coins from the bank (=yet another Testnet Bitcoin Wallet), and then the game can start. (For easier transparency for all players, use single address only and no BIP39/BIP32 HD-wallet). Ladies and Gentlemen, start your smartphones and play Monopoly!
In the future, when playing Monopoly with real money, I propose that the Monopoly Bank opens a LN payment network, all players open a channel to it via their smartphones' wallets supporting LN protocol, and then play with real bitcoins.

you misunderstand!!! you have to do it only once and then never again. Just educate yourself - it is fun to accumulate the right knowledge!


Chances are it will be kept since demand is there. Then would you take the risk of buying the other coin if it runs danger to be orphaned away?...


No, if markets want it, it will  persist forever, just like a parallel chain in case of ETH/ETC. But with the difference that if it ever gains majority hashrate and overtakes old-chain (maybe because SegWit and LN rocks!) the old-chain disappears and all its wealth vanishes. I would not ever invest in such risky commodity and try to get rid of it asap after a fork, before others see what I am describing here and price goes to zero.


Now you are discussing ~~a HARD~~ *another* fork, which is another discussion! IF this happens, we have a clean situation: One big-blocker-anti-segwit-anti-decentralization-coin with dumb "coffee-purchasing-on-chain" philosophy, and one technically reasonable segwit coin with many new use cases to come. No question which coin will be demanded by the market.

indeed. and blocking segwit is therefore irresponsible, irrespective (!) of the base blocksize question.
segwit widens the eco system. blocksize incr. only kicks the can further w/o really building new structures that give a real efficiency bost wrt "adoption per blocksize" with new additional possibilities (w/o eliminating the status quo ones!)
to be clear: in the end we need all scalings incl. bade blocksize increase, saying "1mb forever is ok" is definitely very wrong.

The idea is that "PR" is *any* private key of the inputs. *One* key is sufficient, even if there are 10 inputs. The purpose is that it's impossible for an outside attacker to change the tx, because he doesn't own the PrKey.
For special exotic transactions that don't involve privKeys to unlock a btc, one could also use any other arbitrary privKey for the "outer" signature (whose pubKey then needs to be included in the tx of course). It'd serve the same purpuse - avoiding anybody not in possession of the privKey to alter the tx.
edit: for the exotic tx: most straight forward, one would add another "normal" input to the (otherwise "exotic") transaction, and use the privkey of that "alibi" input address for the "outer protection" against tx malleability.

Your question cannot be answered, because you do not specify what you mean by hacking. So please clarify: What do you mean by "hacking"?
- Hacking computers to steal bitcoins? [is illegal already]
- Hacking the Bitcoin protocol to disclose or exploit a mathematical/cryptographical weakness? [currently not illegal I suppose, but might be illegal if the intention is to enrich oneself]
- Attacking the consensus system by 51% attack or alike? [currently not illegal I suppose, but might be illegal if the intention is to enrich oneself]
- DoS-ing the Bitcoin protocol? [not ilegal today I suppose - but might become illegal one day if Bitcoin gets so important that it is considered part of the public infrastructure like the internet today - sabotaging public infrastructure thus causing economical damages to many will probably be illegal]
- Other? (what?)

What does OP mean with "which"? When you ask for "which", you ask for at least two options? What are the two options under discussion here? Is OP asking whether Bitcoin would be more valuable with or without a hard-fork? Is that what OP means? Then WHAT kind of hardfork are we talking about? And if we say "no hardfork", what is the assumption as to how Bitcoin evolves? Stagnation? Or SegWit introduction? These are very different paths for a non-hardfork scenario.

If markets (i.e. who buys Bitcoin on exchanges) want UASF, the UASF chain will have a much higher market price, and this will extinct the non-segwit-chain in short time, it has no realistic chance to survive.

True. In US the Fed can and does give credit directly to the treasury of the USA.
In EU the ECB is not allowed to finance states directly. Of course there are many tricks to work around, but it is not easy. And: There is one and the same central bank (ECB) for all states from Greece to Luxemburg. The same money policy is not good for all. What is too inflationary for Germany or Luxemburg or Finland is too strict for Greece or Portugal or Spain or Italy or France. So the ECB must compromise. The compromise can mean too inflationary in Luxemburg adn Germany but at the same time not inflationary enough for Greece and Portugal, such that only bail-ins help in those countries eventually.

My point is that nationalism always results in wars, no crypto can save you from it, and if the land burns in flames you won't care about bitvoin anyway but try to survive.
better start thinking for yourself than running after some guru.

Apparently you understand and describe the mechanisms correctly.
However, I would use a different terminology when it comes to money and money creation, to avoid misunderstandings and add clarity:
Instead of saying "The private banks don't create money", I would introduce two distinct terms "Central bank money" and "Debt money" (both of which unfortunately carry the same unit of account [e.g. "EUR"] which doesn't help reducing confusion).
Then the correct phrasing is: Private banks don't create central bank money, but they very well do create debt money!
Without this distinction we have these unnecessary arguments on whether or not private banks create "money", and both sides are right but mean different things when saying "money".
Clearly, in most routine situations in daily life we all treat both kinds of money interchangeably; e.g. I don't care whether you give me 10 EUR in cash (central bank money) or via SEPA bank transfer (debt money). This justifies summarizing both C- and D-money under the overall term "money", and the statement "private banks create money" is correct. On the other hand, from strict money theoretical point of view, it is justified to only call C-money really "money", and the statement "private banks don't create money" is correct.
Hence we should stop using the term "money" altogether when debating whether or not private banks "create money", to avoid misunderstandings.
Instead, we should use a more precise language with clearly defined terminology when discussing topics as delicate as this.

the main difference is not the 1 MB.
The main difference is whether or not to have a chain split.
with 2MB you 100% will have a chain split. not because I or you or Greg M personally thinks 2MB is too much, but because THERE ARE a significant nb. of people in the economy and market not willing to accept and give value to the HF 2MB chain.
So these ppl will keep the original chain and it will continue to exist.
so this chain will have value, and will hence be listed on exchanges etc. And it will also ckaim the name "bitcoin" because it is the original, unaltered, Bitcoin.
So there will be a split, with all its negative consequences.
with 1MB Segwit such split won't occur.
That's the main difference.

It's called "Money Supply" for currencies, and there are different kinds of money supply defined (M0, M1, M2, M3, ...) because of the complexities of the fractional reserve banking system characteristic for all fiat currencies. Also, it is probably not fully transparent and publicly know what the M0 money supply (the money issued by the respective central bank) is, for each particular currency.
Bitcoin lacks many properties of the fiat money system, it has a transparent total supply and no fractional reserve banking. So the community apparently found it useful to use the term "market cap" in analogy to "money supply" for Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies.
In fact, Bitcoin has properties of company shares and of fiat currencies, it is something new, so a word has to be found to express the "total market value" of all bitcoins in existence, and the community seems to have converged to use the term "Market Cap".
There is nothing bad or wrong about it. If a new phenomenon comes up, you typically describe it with words from similar phenomena that already exist and that are familiar. That has always been so in the history of languages.
NICE ANALOGY:
Similarly, the power of cars was expressed in "horse powers". Guess why? Horses were familiar to the people. Probably, in the beginning some pedants have highlighted that there are no horses physically under the hood of a car (which some non-tec-savvy people probably really believed there are) and hence the term "horse-power" is not correct and is reserved for horses and cannot be applied to cars. But still the term has survived until the present day.

I don't deny it. But there are different kinds of money (M0, M1, M2, ...), all have their money supply. Incl. credit money. Again, over-simplification is ubiquitous.


That's true. Because credit can (and is being) created arbitrarily. But it is not "printing". With printing, you created money on one side of the balance sheet only. With creating credit (even with interest), not only money but also liabilities are created. That is macro-economically a big difference, it is not just "semantics".

Many do so in expectation of higher prices after halving. So people like you are buying NOW and won't buy after the halving.

If minds are set for a compromise, I suggest they adopt "[BIP100.5]( (inofficial name apparently) and agree on a parameter set.
It defines 8 fixed parameters. Depending on their choice you end up with BIP100 or BIP101, or with something in-between:
Parameters(BIP101) = [1.01369, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
Parameters(BIP100) = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.2, 1.2]
Parameters(BIP100.5) = [1.01, 1.0014, 1.0014, 1.01, 1.03, 1.06, 1.10, 1.20]
Parameter 1 = default growth factor per 2 weeks. Parameters 2 to 8 = maximum growth (or decline) factors on-top of the default factor, for miner majorities of 55% to 90%.

I agree, and that's why I said, "at least". Of course, realistically, people are buying more than just coffee, and making more than one purchase per person per day. Business payments etc. not even included, let alone the vast amount of Machine-to-machine payments.
In contrast, we have means to scale off-chain in decentralized way via LN etc. NOW, without ANY negative side effects on Bitcoin's decentralization and security, so no way to explain plausible to hold it back, if not for egistic interests of a few (and we know the names of those).

I understand what you are saying, but you miss one point (or you did not understand my concern - so I'll elaborate):
The way you describe it, the ledger is not objectively verifiable any more by an independent node. Let's take again the example above, but slightly modified: I own 1 IOTA on address A, and I keep it there and do NOT transfer it to B or to anywhere!
Then I go away and return to the internet 1 year later. Now I check the ledger of IOTA (which has evolved in the meantime). To my surprise, address A contains 0 IOTA now and address E contains 1 IOTA.
I want to check what happened, so I go and download the full ledger. But today's ledger does not contain any trace of A whatsoever. I am outraged. I go to another node operator and ask him what happend last year with my address A's 1 IOTA. He says: "Well, that 1 IOTA was transferred to B, then to C, D and finally E." I say: "That's impossible! I never transferred it to B!" He replies: "Can you prove it?" I say: "No I can't, because the ledger of today is incomplete w.r.t. the history, I cannot verify it." He say's: "Exactly, so leave me alone." I say: "f+++ you, I will only use cryptos with fully verifyable ledgers in the future. With IOTA, I can get scammed by the network and cannot prove that I got scammed, and the network cannot prove that it didn't scam me! What kind of ledger is that, that I have to trust so much?! No thanks!"

If you read [this]( it becomes very clear why Björn Ulvaeus is against cash. And clearly, he would be absolutely CONTRA Bitcoin for the very same reasons.

With Segwit2x ("2x" means hard fork) the Bitcoin blockchain will split for sure - there will be two bitcoins afterwards.
Because this has nothing to do with whether &gt; 51% signal for NYA or not. As long as a considerable part of the market favours legacy bitcoin (i.e. no hardfork chain), the old (no HF) chain will persist, and hence will have value, and hence will be traded, and hence will be mined.
The fallacy that 51% (or any other majority whatsoever) is relevant for HARD fork at all is a fallacy that seems to be in the heads very firmly.

As it seems you missunderstood the article or interpreted too much into it.
If you remove the SIM card from your phone and delete all WiFi passwords and do a factory reset, the Android phone should be completely safe and completely offline, and completely inaccessible even by the NSA! I do not see why I should believe anything different, the article you linked talks about the NSA having access to normal phone data of normal connected phones and the user databases on the cloud servers.
***The article does not say anything about "hardware backdoored modems of some android devices", that you claim some devices are known(!) to have.***
Again, if you can provide sources, please do so, otherwise I have to assume that this is yet another conspiracy theory and your claim that some devices are known(!) to have "hardware backdoored modems" is simply a sheer lie.
Note: Is is in the intererst of the NSA to make the public believe that such HW backdoors exist! Because then the users think that talking particular security precautions does not help because NSA can anyway read everything they want. So the user will not take any special security measures at all, and THIS is what NSA really wants!

I did. Result: Surprisingly, the opposite is true when really thinking through it:
If an exchange DOES give you BCH and trade BCH (e.g. **Kraken**), its customers are likely to keep their bitcoins on the exchange, have no increased incentive to withdraw their bitcoins before 1 Aug. This is exactly what exchanges need if they run on fractional reserves - they must prevent a "bank run" by all means. If running on fractional BTC reserves worked, running on fractional BCH reserves will work just as well.
If an exchange does NOT give you BCH, much more of their customers will withdraw their bitcoins within a short time, all at once, before and over 31 Jul/1 Aug. This is exactly what you'd call a bankrun. Such "bank run" would be even more likely if the exchanges openly inform their customes well in advance by email and recommend to withdraw their bitcoin if they want BCH (e.g. **Bitstamp**). Clearly, an exchange running on fractional reserves wouldn't do that.
Conclusion: **An exchange expressively  NOT supporting BCH is LESS likely to run on fractional reserves.**

Craig explicitly said that he envisioned a Bitcoin that can buy coffee etc. for every person on earth every day, on-chain.
Let's be conservative and assume really just one coffee per day and nothing else at all. That amounts to 8 Billion tx/day, compared to today's 3tps= 260,000 tx/day --&gt; that's a factor of 30,000, so in his vision we'd have at least(!) 30 GB blocks each 10min or 1600 TByte per year. At least!

bip91 and segeit2x are not different branches.
bip148 only comes into play if bip91 does not activate segwit.
another most important HF, the "2x" part of segwit2x, in Nov2017, should also be shown.
BitcoinABC as an attempt of bitcoin enemies to further fragment bitcoin by completely rejecting segwit and releasing the block size limit could be included.

temporarily yes, if no replay protections have bern made.


that's why there is a flag day - so for this transition phase handling is similar to hardfork (difference being that long-term it is not - people just hodling their coin and reconnecting 1 week or month later or so could carry on w/o update _ although mot recommended of course)


segwit mining majority will come autmatically in very short time because non-segwit miners mining on incompatible chain couldn't sell their mining rewards to anyone.
having understood this, the other two things turn out to be just "nice to have" (but of course recommended, and it will happen of course).


"Fork", not "hardfork". And such fork will only happen if the non-segwit chain has more hash power than the segwit chain in the beginning. Under these circumstances, once the segwit chain becomes longer than the non-segwit chain (because rational miners don't mine coins nobody wants), the non-segwit chain will make a big re-org and become equal to the segwit chain.
This is the most important part to understand! I have described this in my other, linked, post, and only if you fully understand this you can understand why UASF cannot really go wrong if the community and markets (= who buys bitcoins from miners) really want segwit.

every 4th block is antpool (25% hashrate), that's 36 blocks per day or 252 per week.
the likelihood that after a first antpool block, the next 4 blocks are antpool, too, is 0.25^4 = 0.39% = 1/256.
Conclusion: you'll see a series of 5 antpool blocks about once per week, a series of 6 around once per month, and a series of 8 around once in a bit more than a year.

For those who don't know yet what kind of mind he is (or has): He is an advocate of **TONAL UNITS for Bitcoin**! Everybody who wants to read about Bitcoin units and expects some unseful, practical information at " will think Bitcoin community is completely nuts, when finding the table about tonal units directly next to the decimal units. But nobody uses tonal units in Bitcoin (except probably him)! And tonal units is nothing Bitcoin specific in the first place, it is just about mapping the binary system to a bizarre new language of numbers. (more nonsense here: 
And in the same way he advocates an abosolutely deminishing minority opinion on Bitcoin units, he now appears to try to **impose** his equally **deminishing minority opinion** on what a "paper wallet" is to the world.

Bros and Siss, that's why Bitcoin and its ecosystem will likely evolve towards a combnation of:
- increased block size limit
- higher tx fees (mandatory long-term to secure the network as block reward goes down)
- sidechains (for low tx fees and fancy special features)
- off-blockchain transaction (even coinbase-to-circle transactions (for example) can be done off-blockchain and cumulatively settled between the companies on-blockchain every few hours or so.
This will ensure decentralization and scalability.

When merchant and customer use the same (or in future: even different) off-blockchain wallets, the fee issue is not present. This will become the use-normal case when Bitcoin tx-fees increase so much (as a result of tx fee price competition due to limited block size and increasing Bitcoin transaction rate per second) that they will become hurting for end-customers. 
The bitcoin protocol's fee structure will have to keep being like this to be sustainable. If you don't like it, don't use it.
But it is not quite logic to me what you say. Assume you as a customer want to make an online-purchase for 10 Euro. The merchant gives you two choices:
1.) Paypal: Pay 10.00 Euro (the 2% paypel fee is already included in the merchant's price calculations here)
2.) Bitcoin: Merchant gives me 1.5% special Bitcoin discount (which still leaves a 0.5% advantage over paypal to the merchant), i.e. I need to pay only 9.85 EUR. Now I have the add the "unknown" bitcoin network TX Fee. I know it is in the order of few cents. So no matter  whether I pay 0.5 cents or even 5 cents tx fee, it is still cheaper than paypal for me.

If it is possible to tamper a tx, prove it by just one single example, or I don't believe it.

- show the modified tx included in the blockchain
- show someone spent the output in the blockchain who shouldn't be allowed to, acc. to initially signed tx.

But without adoption, it is easy to achieve all the rest. Then any comparison is meaningless.
Even LTC's adoption is almost zero these days now, when measured in transactions per second or per block.  Around 20-30 litecoin TX per 2.5 minutes, that's 1 TX in 6 seconds, that's nothing. With that it's easy to satisfy all other conditions.

Sort of arrogant top-down attitude, don't you think? Also to the upvoters, I think they did not think about it properly.
Instead of blaming the user (you will never succeed educating all users, as little as you succeed to convince the dumb masses to use vi editor or the command line, which is more efficient then clicking 20 times, but still users will prefer the clumsy GUI), we should strive to design the software such that it is safe against user mis-behaviour.
In this particular case it is simple: DISABLE copy-pasting the mnemonic seed word list. Instead show an image or something with the word-list (something not copy-able). Then force the user to write it on paper. Then force the user to validate by re-typing from paper - like in mycelium (have a look there - program supports with text-auto-completion as the user types the words from the word list for user convenience, so it is least annoying!). If the user skips this manual validation, either do not proceed with the program at all, or always show a very annoying nag-screen warning (like mycelium). As soon as the wallet balance exceeds &lt;tbd&gt; EUR (in bitcoin), program shall re-insist in validating the seed before continuing... there are so many possibilities - display reminders with test-questions, display another screen with another question about how the user has made the backup. Do it in an annoying way! It really makes sense to think in this direction. Because in the end, the program should behave to the user like a parent behaves to an inexperienced child: Would the parents let the child leave the house bare-feet in winter? No! It might seem annoying to the impatient child to wait and put on shoes, but the parents know it is better for the child to put on shoes!
Same with backing up the seed: The program should educate the inexperienced user in a friendly-forcefully manner. The program knows better what is good to the user, so it can and should be programmed like that! Eventually, the user (child) will be grateful that the program (parents) behaved like that and forced him to act responsibly.

Are you referring to the fact that BTC prices at bitcoin.de are somewhat above other exchanges like Bitstamp? Or you are referring to the 0.5% fee at each buy/sell operation at bitcoin.de?
For the former, I think that is a question of market mechanics. As bitcoin.de gets more liquid in the future, also the delta to other exchanges should decrease. But anyway - higher rates are good for customers paying with bitcoin (they get more value for their bitcoins), whereas for merchants it doesn't matter when they anyhow revert to EUR, as is usually the case nowadays.
For the latter - 0.5% is relatively normal I thought, isn't it?

If a normal person or company wants to have "real" central bank money in another form than cash, it is just not possible until now. If you bring your cash to a private bank, you exchange the real money ("M0", or "central bank money") for a liability (IOU) of the private bank to pay you this amount as cash. So why would you do that? Because cash can be physically stolen or get burnt in a fire, and also banks give some (tiny?) interest. Disadvantage are risks of bank runs or something like "Cyprus 2013".
Since today, every Ecquadorian has the posibility to possess real "M0" money in electronic form.
The payment aspect is just another side-aspect. Of course, if somebody has a central bank money account for this money, it makes sense to develop a smartphone app for easy online banking and transfer (or "payment") of this money from one such account to anohter, and it makes sense to provide tool like point-of-sale software for merchants, or APIs for websites, to support payments from/to these new accounts.
But all this is about central bank money, which is different from Paypal, which opoerates on the traditional digital  "IOU money" of the private banking system.
*Edit: Seems like the central bank currently does this with USD which they don't issue themselfes. My answer was already assuming the next step - then ecuador central bank does the same with a new sef-issued money.*

Except if the sender used too little tx fee. Then it might likely stay at zero forever, or at least for days, and sender has plenty of time for bouble spending. Also note that double spending on 0 confirmations requires no mining power!
So I would say 0 confirmation for small things like a coffee (say &lt; 50€ or so), else 1 confirmation. For &gt;50,000€, maybe wait a few more confirmations.

Because it is toxic. It invertes the healthy incentive structure of bitcoin!
Up to now, any egoistic miner also acted in the eco system's interest. Thi sis different now that Jihan has a monoplo for asic boost algo.
Calculations show clearly (I won't repeat them here, has been calculated by myself earlier, and has also been demonstrated by Andreas A. later-on in a video talk):
A Non-SegWIt Asicboost-enabled Bitcoin worth 500 USD menas MUCH more mining profit for Jihan than a 10,000 USD Bitcoin with Segwit where he loses his asicboost competitive advantage. The advantge amounts to many millions USD per month.
Therefore, he pulls all registers (incl. lots and loads of paid fake accounts on reddit - imagine how much he can afford for only 10% of his extra profit) to postpone Asic-boost disabling soft-forks as long as possible. Each month, or even weeks, is worth millions for him. This is not egaggerated, it is simple maths.
So he blocks progress of Bitcoin protocol and accepts Bitcoin losing ground for other cryptos, and prevents stronger user adoption and more use cases.

Not sure if you are a paid Jihan shill or a blinded victim of their propaganda. You cannot explain in how fa bitcoin core with Segwit, schnorr etc. on the roadmap subsidizes Blockstream. It is free software. Everyone can build technology on top of it. Same chances for all. The best make the highest profits. Just fair. Not so with Jihan, his ASIC Boost is unfair and(!) provides incentive to block Bitcoin's evolution. No comparison really between these two.

You are assuming that the government can only capture people when they exchange bitcoin to fiat. In fact, of cause the government can also capture them when they exchange bitcoins for poducts or services. Extremely simple&amp;evident examples:
- a restaurant offering food for btc cannot do so secretly without the government noticing it.
- same for any other brick&amp;mortar store.
- an online shop cannot advertise or offer bitcoin payments without government noticing it.
- an online customer who buys a tangible product online and pays with bitcoin still has to enter his name and address for delivery. At that point the government can find out by accessing the online-shop's database (e.g. by hacking or by bribing an employee of that shop, as happend before to identify tax evaders).

if it succeeds, then not originally because of hasrate, but because the market demands it more than SegWit1X. The hashrate will only follow market value (i.e. how many fiat one gets for 1 BTC.

From all I know this is a FUD without ANY proof. Patents get published, so this claim should be provable, the patent be researchable via patent database. If you have a proof, you are very welcome to send a URL to the patent.


I like the roadmap. Segwit now to lay the foundation for enhance user adoption and more use cases by enabling Lightning. This also increases the efficiency of the blockchain in terms of user adoption per blockchain size. This is what I consider an excellent starting point for further evolution. Next step is schnorr signatures, which is a genius signature by which you summarize many (if not all) signures of a block into one, thereby saving a lot of data again. This again increases the efficiency of the blockchain in terms of user adoption per blockchain size.
This is a smart and adequate scaling strategy, much better than stupid block size increase.
While doing all this, Bitcoin remains small and verifiable by any average internet users, no need to trust any big company with big servers. This is what makes Bitcoin valuable at its core.
Once these changes are implemented and all efficiency measures done, we have to see how the eco-system evolves around Lightning and sidechains like RSK.
Then, I assume at some point adoptin grows so much that Bitcoin blocksize needs to be increased. At that point, I will carefully observe the arguments and bitcoin core's stance. Will they be stubborn THEN, then I will put my voice in favour of a block size increase. But for such situation, many core devs have also made clear they consider block size increase well possible.
The notion that they want "1 MB forever" is FUD. And even if it were true, I would go against them when it is the right time. For the reasons given above, the right time is not now. Now is the time to make Bitcoin protocol more efficient, more use case enabling, and that s exactly bitcoin core's roadmap. So a the present time, I could not endorse their current roadmap more, for purely technical reasons.


This is of no relevance. Bitcoin is open and every company can (and many do) work on Lighningnetwork solutions. It is not that blockstream has the only right to do so. And if blockstream are the best technicians, so be it, and they deserve to make money.
If I have the choice between company AA making lots of money at the EXPENSE of bitcoin by blocking Bitcoin protocol evolution and benefitting from an unfair patented algorithm, and company BB having the potential of making lots of money in the future by evolving Bitcoin's infrastructure, making Bitcoin mor versatile, add new use cases, and making Bitcoin more open for further user adoption, there is not question for any sane mind that BB is the way to go. Only conspiracy theorists would see a conspiracy at BB and would be blind against AA and endorse AA.


I cannot see any, and even if - as long as the roadmap is, objectively, the right, I follow this roadmap. I am not "married" with them. Should their roadmap become against the eco-system's interests, I will definitely raise my voice against them.

Well, technically more accurate it is the central bank, not the government, who does all this. Note that in many cases the central bank is a private, not a federal/public/governmental, institution, also in the US (the FED is not federal but private [and it is not publicly known even whio exactly owns the FED, but to the greatest parts some private banks or those how own the private banks], this is no conspiracy but fact - everyone educated person should know this, but it's never teached at school, but many good tutorials exist in the internet, or interviews from G. Edward Griffin and many others).
Also, technically, Quantitative Easing measn the FED gives a credit (i.e. money) to the government or treasury, in exchange for a piece of paper that the government/treasury prints out and gives to the FED - this piece of paper is a bond. Note that in Europe the process is technically a bit different, because the ECB is not allowed to buy government bonds directly, but it can buy them indirectly from private banks [by the way, this is what's going to happen soon]. So effectively, it is almost the same as just creating money out of thin air and injecting it into the economy ("almost" because: except that there is the interest rate).

One has to take into coniseration all sides. Only looking at what looks most reasonable to the customer gives a bad technical solution.
OP doesn't know how Bitcoin works (alone the suggestion with the change shows this very well), hence the one-sided view. Percentage fee of transferred money makes no sense. Fee must be proportional to effort or cost, not to amount of money transferred. Otherwise miners will decide not to include a tx (which cannot be imposed by the protocol).
For user experience: If wallet SW implements these complex formulas correctly (which it acrually should), the user doesn't have to bother and it is easier than ever for the user.
So don't blame the fee structure of the Bitcoin protocol, but blame the wallet SW.

indeed, so you can lead by example and start. It seems you need to learn a lot and question your current status quo "knowledge".


For ages there was almost zero inflation before 1913 in US, read the history. It started after the FED was founded. Again, educate yourself and don't talk idiotic nonsense.


What kind of empty rhetorical phrase is that - "done many good things for the us dollar"? We are not sitting in a mainstream TV show here where you can make impression with such empty phrases.
Better would be to serve the people, not the dollar. Serving the dollar is not a self purpose.
Anyway, define what are the "good for dollar" things that the Federal Reserve system has done? Inflating the Dollar's value away? causing debt crisis? is it the systemic built-in redistribution of wealth from working people to rich people that you like about the federal reserve system? Or the environmental destruction that it brings? The regular collaps of money system as "built-in feature" of the fed system?


what? (see above)


That's the petro dollar system that has kicked in after gold standard was broken in 1971 (bretton woods). it mandates saudi arabia (and others) to sell oil for USD ONLY. In exchange they get weapons and military protection. so printing usd equates to drilling oil, just so much simpler. A genius chess move by US to ensure power. Only this way they could have huge trade deficits for decades w/o collapse. Printing USD equated to drilling oil, and all the world accumulated USD in exchange for goods.
The reason for usd being the leading currency is the US military as enabler of the petro Dollar system. Don't be fooled.
Other countries have an equivalent central bank money system just like the FED, but w/o the strong military backing it. That makes the difference.

but that would be very risky, because once the altcoin (=non-segwit chain) becomes shorter than the segwit chain, it would re-org and become equal to the segwit chain. Then all holders of "old-coins" would lose everything.

you are missing that
* x/2 + x/2 = x
is not how value is calculated if a crypto coin splits.
value increases more than linear with usage, hence network effect is paramount.
Let's illustrate this by an example, assuming power of two:
* value = constant * usage^2
Or in short:
* v = c * u^2
For simplicity let's assume c = 1 and u = 50:
 * value = 50^2 = 2500.
Now the coin splits in three, with usage ratio of e.g. 20+20+10=50.
Resulting total value now:
* v = v1+v2+v3 = 20^2 + 20^2 + 10^2 = 400 + 400 + 100 = 900.
So total value has dropped from 2500 to 900.
You can do your own calculations accordigly by varying usage ratios or the exponent.

even at 1% hash rate, the original bitcoin would still exust and be traded on exchanges. As it is valued high (because it is the original coin and no hijacked jihan-coin) market forces will naturally pull miners into mining original bitcoin. the 1% will not remain 1% for long.

It is just very very likely - it's not about what I hope.
Look at the trend. The China-MtGox-Bubble in 2013 started at ca. 100. We are still in this bubble. People like you prove that there is still a lot of optimism with desperate hope - which means prices are still going to decline. There is all reason to believe that price will go back to 100 USD, and at least shortly touch 99 USD (double-digit) - before a strong rebound - whether this will keep prices permanantly above 100 or not is the next question then. If not, the way is free to 10 USD. But personally I don't think we will see prices below 30 USD again.

Such central bank dig curr would have nothing to do with bitcoin, so it's better suited in economics subreddit than bitcoin subreddit.
Interestingly, when central bank (cb) issues such digital money, it's as if people have accounts directly at the cb. Unlike bank deposits at private banks, this would be like digtal cash, so no bank runs possible, no "fractional reserve" money.
Also cb could set negative interest (demurrage) rates to acceletate money circulation.
Also money flow would be fully controllable to avoid tax evasion and ease censorship.
In terms of money politics, it could be a new paradigm in money politics, because new mechanisms of how to control money supply would enter the scene.

not necessarily on-chain for every coffee, but a user should still be able to go on-chain e.g. for moving some funds from one wallet to the other now and then.
with current block size limit, for only 20 Mill. adopters, the capacity is not even enough to allow each user making one transaction per quarter (3 months).
That's not even enough if lightning is used for most transactions, because the opening of payment channels still have to happen on-chain.
Bitcoin would degenerate to a sole settlement layer.
If this is gonna happen, no doubt another crypto-currency with less restrictive block size limits will "take over" Bitcoin's market share.

more support from certain corporations, not from users and experts.


This is a misconception.
I am pro segwit and other smart scalings. If all this is implemented, if adoption further increases, and then base blocksize needs to increase to accomodate this raised demand, I will be pro hardfork. but not now. now is too early. decentralization first.
At any given moment we have to do what is best at the given moment.


if bitcoin base blocksize never ever scales, yes. but this is not a threat we have to worry about TODAY. If this is really bcore's intention (which I HEAVILY doubt - alone from the fact that bcore is not a monolithic group), I can still distance myself from them later. At the moment, their roadmap is correct, smart, strategically right.
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:57:05
I knew there's a catch
@_date: 2017-07-01 14:44:39


One thing at a time! Focus now should be protocol evolution/improvements/efficiency improvements, such that each additional future MB of base blocksize increase has the greatest possible effect on adoption. If we just scale on-chain stuüpidly and keep the protocol inefficient, the adoption/blocksize ration will be very bad!


I do not see the "idea that a bitcoin HF can never happen". Virtually all Core devs always say it will happen, just not now. And that's exactly correct. Those claiming otherwise are either victims of defamation or do defamation actively to destroy Bitcoin.


Again, nobody (except a few meaningless individuals/trolls) says block size shall never increases. You are probably victim of such defamation.


And nobody (except  a few meaningless individuals/trolls) claimed it would. However, SegWit is an important, crucual, contribution to improve the situation in a sustainable way, and that is what counts!


Again, from what you write, I see you really fell victim of the propaganda. Bitcoin core does not wnat it NOW because ding it NOW implies a 100% for sure blockchain hard fork, because there are too many forces in the markets (outside core) that would remain on the 1 MB chain. Also, pressure is not yet there (price is low now that the blockchain spam attackes have become less). At this point segwit and other subsequent things like Schnorr signatures (probably you don't even know what that is and means) are the best ways to improve the protocol, and THEN, as adoption grows, and true (non-spam) fees get more expensive etc., there will be consens to increase base blocksize via HF without the risk of a (significant) chain split. But that time is not now yet. In that sense core is following the trend, not setting the trend.


Exactly, and that is by Bitcoin blocksize WILL increase (with agreement of core) after LN causes huge mainstream adoption. But that time is not yet now.

Proposal: Convince Telegram developers to implement a kind of simple plugin-api by which 3rd parties can extend menus (main and context menus) of telegram by additional entries. Idea is that e.g. a text file of a certain simple syntax can be "loaded" from telegram's "Settings", and then the new menu items are installed. Then 3rd party "bot operators" like telebit can initiate messages via gui, and show little pop-ups, instead of doing all via the "command line". This way user acceptance could be greatly improved.
Note: GetGems is not a solution because hardly anyone of the Telegram users can be convinced to switch to GetGems.

It is Craig's (the Scammer's) scenario, not mine.
BTC can achieve scaling by a combination of on-chain off chain (and various kinds of off-chain, like LN, sidechains), and efficience gains on-chain like Schnorr, and by doing it all not at once but over time as adoption grows.
It can only be achieved by using all possibilities. Mono-receipies can only fail.

*In a sense*, Bitcoin is actually *not* peer-to-peer. Here's why:
If I transfer 1 BTC from 1abc to 1xyz, this transfer is done via the *blockchain*, the [decentralized] ledger of all transactions: So there are 3 "parties" involved so-to-say:
- Me, the owner of 1abc
- "The blockchain"
- The recipient who is owner of 1xyz
Now, in Bitcoin, since we trust that the blockchain cannot be corrupted/reverted/manipulate etc., the blockchain is a "passive" party that we can ignore. So, Bitcoin is *effectively* (even if not *actually*) peer-to-peer indeed.
HOWEVER, at the moment that the blockchain (or more generally the ledger) is central (as would certainly be the case for a state-coin), the peer-to-peer characteristics is gone, sorry.
@_date: 2015-03-10 23:19:19
The world is not perfect. But you seem to ignore the other side: With current block size limit we have practically 2.5 transactions per second (tps) = 80 Million transactions per year (the 7 tps figure is a rather theoretical number).
Assuming that bitcoin is adopted by only 800 Million people (~10% of world population plus some companies), then everyone can make **one transaction every 10 years**, on average. For "full world adoption", you can make **one transaction in a life time** if you are lucky.
Do you prefer Bitcoin to be like this?

The blocksize is close to 1 MB already, and waiting till it shows symptoms of congestion is definitely waiting too long. And investors don't trust that Bitcoin will scale as they need. So they are rather considering going with other blockchains like Ethereum. Statements like...
*"* ***Maybe*** *[!] in the future we'll need to raise it, maybe* ***not*** *[!] [despite growth of bandwidth and storage being certain]"*
...help to further reduce the trust. Because for anybody observing blockchain traffic the trend is more than clear, so still saying MAYBE instead of CERTAINLY is a clear sign of either lack of intelligence or lack of willingness to ever increase the block size. It is a provocation against any sane mind. Unfortunately such statements come not only from anonymous redditors but also from core devs, and since they cannot be considered stupid, the second explanation applies (i.e. lack of will). And this is really bad.

If there is someone who is a drug addict, and another one who gave him the drugs so that he could become addicted in the first place - who is to blame?
Only possible answer: Both! Saying that any one of the two is completely innocent is nonsense.
Here the "someones" are countries and institutions and cartels. The subentities (elites of politics and finance) having done the decisions to give/take drugs are not the same as those subentities (the people) who suffer the pains or penalties. So the reality is a bit more complicated than the simplified drug dealer vs. addict metapher.

Today the central banks control money supply indirectly, depending on which money supply we are talking about.
We have to differentiate different kinds of money supply: There is the actual central bank money called M0. It is either physical cash, or digital money that the private banks have in their "bank account" at the corresponding central bank (cb). Clearly, cb has direct control over M0 today, because it decides how much (M0-)money it lends to the private banks.
But for the economy, what is more important are M1, M2, M3. These are supersets of M0, containing M0 plus liabilities of private banks to someone, as a result of credits. Because we have a fractional reserve banking system everywhere in the world, Mn (n&gt;0) is (much) greater than M0.
The money circulating in the real economy is mainly M1, not M0!
So shortage of M1 would have a negative effect on the economy, and too much M1 would cause inflation.
The central bank can influence M1 only *indirectly*, not directly, because M1 is a result of how many credits the private banks give out to players in the real economy. The cb can thus have only indirect influence mainly by changing the interest rate at which they lend money to private banks, which changes M0, and as a consequence, also M1. But the ratio M1:M0 can hardly be influenced by central banks, it is up to private banks' policies of giving out credits. And that's where the problem is. If private banks loose trust and don't give out credits, M1 gets smaller, and we get an economical crisis. cb has to increase M0 to increase M1 again. Shoudl suddenly trust re-appear, cb could not quickly withdraw M0, but the ratio M1:M0 would increase (private banks give more credits), and we have an inflation all of a sudden.
When we pursue the idea of digital money in the form of digital *central bank* money (M0) for everyone (i.e. private people and companies are eligible of holding money accounts directly at the central bank), this sort of money (this is then another, 3rd sort of "M0") would be used much more often in the real economy, and as a result cb would have more direct influence on that part of the money supply that is relevant for the real economy (talking about that money that is circulating in the economy) than today.

Maybe the definition of "sidechain" had changed?
When I last read about the sidechain concept (long time ago, probably &gt; 1year) it was about two independent blockchains [can have different block times, hash algos or even consensus systems pow/pos] that observe *each other* (in case of 2-way-peg) and can lock coins on the one chain thereby unlocking coins of equivalent value on the other chain. This implies that a miner on the other chain where coins get unlocked must observe the one chain to know that it can unlock coins.
@_date: 2016-07-24 03:34:05


Then i think we arrive at what i already said: "someone" has to observe the sidechain (100 MB/10min) and fully validate it, and the bitcoin miner has to trust this "someone" to unlock bitcoins if someone exchanged sidecoins for bitcoins. The "someone" can be the bitcoin miner or someone else. if the "someone else" provided wrong info to the btc miner, the btc miner will unlock the bitcoins while the sidecoins are still usable (and not destroyed) on the sidechain.

I strongly suspect that when they say "directly between participants" they don't talk about decentralized systems. I think they mean with "direct" something more direct than today:
- Today, if we want to make a wire transfer from person A to person B, there are two middlemen, namely the bank of A and the bank of B. Moreover, the money transfer must be settled between these two private banks in that A's bank transfers the corresponding amount of central bank money to B's bank (which typically occurs digitally by data base entry at the central bank, where both private banks have an account). So it is quite complicated and not at all peer-to-peer today. When there is a payment service provider like ApplePay or PayPal involved, this comes on-top of the entities named before.
- Now compare this with the situation where A and B both directly have some "central bank money" bank accounts at the central bank! Now, if A wants to transfer money to B, they can simply access the central bank's API and initiate the transaction, the central bank will update the database instantly (in seconds) and the transfer is done. So compared to the scenario before, it looks very much like a "direct" transfer from A to B. But strictly speaking, it is not direct but still involves the central bank of course, because the database (or ledger) must be updated of course, and this ledger is of course under the control of the central bank.
So that's what BoE certainly means with "direct" - let's not dream too much.
Or what interest should BoE have to introduce a truely decentralized ledger?

Disillusioning clarification: The statement of BoE is not related to Bitcoin.
If a central bank starts maintaining a central database (can be classical database, no blockchain needed) where everybody (people, companies) can open an account of central bank money, that's already what BoE calls "digital money", as opposed to "cash", because: *Today*, the only central bank money (M0 money supply) in the real economy is cash. The electronic money that we use everyday, like for online-banking, with debit cards etc., is not real "M0" central bank money, but only IOUs, i.e. liabilities of private banks to pay central bank money (cash). There is much more "IOU money" or "debt money" than central bank money, due to the fractional reserve banking system.
 
"Digital money" means that a digital kind of "M0" (central bank) money is introduced for people and companies. It only means that people and companies can have money accounts at the central banks. No more than that.
It would mean total surveillance and control by the way.
So no point in getting too excited about the BoE news. And don't ~~kill the messenger~~ downvote the teacher.

*Edit: Update: Seems like the Ecuador central bank currently does this with USD which they don't issue themselves. My answer was already assuming the next step - when Ecuador central bank does the same with a new sef-issued money.*
This money is "real money" ,i.e. "central bank money" (M0 money supply), unlike bank deposits ("M1-M0" money supply in technical terms).
1.) About today's traditional bank deposits:
Today, a positive balance in your bank account at a private bank means that there is a liability of the bank to pay you this amount in cash. Unfortunately, due to the fractional reserve system, only a small fraction of this money is backed by real cash - that's why there is always the danger of a bank run in our today's money system: If all people suddenly decide to withdraw their money, every(!) bank would go bankrupt (also those with very healthy balance sheets). This is the case for virtually ANY bank in the world. This lies in the way the banking system itself works. So today's traditional bank deposites are NOT "real money" like cash, but only liabilities (i.e. IOUs - the private bank owes you this amount of cash)!
2.) About the new digital money:
Now, the new accounts are bank accounts that people have at the CENTRAL BANK, not a private bank! You need to understand the role of central banks, private banks, and how the fiat money system works, to understand that this is macro-economically a really fundamental difference:
The central bank itself is the issuer of physical cash (=real money "M0"), and the new digital bank accounts at the central bank are also holding "real money" (M0). The central bank does not run a fractional reserve system (that's the definition of central bank, the central bank gives credits to private banks, not to companies or people; if it ran a fractional reserve system, it wouldn't be a central bank any more). So every dollar (or whatever the monetary unit) in the digital new central bank account is backed 1:1 by physical cash, it is real money (M0) just as much as paper cash. By definition of how this works, a bank run is *impossible*, i.e. if all people decided to exchange their central bank electronic money for paper cash - no problem - it can be done - because it is the same thing by definition.
Paradigm change:
If more and more parts of the economy (people, companies) adopt this digital central bank money for daily business, it means that there is more and more "full money" around, and less and less fractionally backed money in accounts of the private banking sector. This has pros and cons. A PRO is that there is no risk of de-stabilization of the system and crash of banks by bank-runs. The CON is that this money does not circulate in the economy while it is held in the people's bank accounts at the central bank. Note that this is fundamentally different from private banks, where cash deposits are used to give out more credits to the world.
So, every paper cash dollar that a customer brings to the new central bank's digital account is withheld from circulation in the economy in the same way as if the customer put the paper cash underneath the matress. On the other hand, if the customer brings the 1 dollar to a private bank, the private bank can use this to give out credits. Depending on the fractional reserve rate (e.g. USA 10%, EU 1% [was 2% until 17 January 2012]), each such Dollar (or Euro) can be used to give out credits at a value of much more than just  one Dollar (US: 10$, EU: 100$, in this example), which increases the "M1" money supply in the economy! So there is a built-in LEVERAGE in money supply (M1) w.r.t. what central bank issues (M0) and what actually ends up to be in circulation (M1).
So, macro-economically, there is a huge difference. The step of introducing this sort of money (electronic "real money M0" for everyone, not only for private banks like until now) can perhaps be seen as a first step of a longer plan of abandoning the fractional reserve banking system altogether in Ecquador.

I read so many explanations, also from bc members, why HF is evil... I do not invent it, so it's not FUD.
irrespective of that... :


Are you kidding?...: *likely* - *sometime* - *couple of years*  --&gt; blocks are full now, fees are increasing now, growth gets suffocated now (also harming decentralization), margin to scale up is available now --&gt; under these circumstances the question is: why only in a "couple of years"? BC has a track record of broken promises or bc dev changing mind at will (see the broken 2MB promise for 7/2016), so when reading this and coupling it with past experience, I MUST come to the conclusion that BC will NEVER scale up, will never HF. Your answer about the very vague far future plan reinforces my understanding.
It's like a politician saying before the election: *"we are likely to decrease taxes sometime in the next couple of years."* --&gt; Are you really so naive to believe that taxes will EVER be decreased?! I am not. And bitcoin-core speak is exactly this speak, their deeds confirm they are not credible - it's no fud but rational thinking.
If my understanding is wrong, then BC is making an astronomically bad job in marketing and communicating their intentions (but since I consider them somewhat intelligent, this is not a viable theory either).

You should write that YOU THINK that the state wants this or that.
But simply claiming "The state wants ..."  doesn't really help your credibility, especially when it is obviously wrong.
You apparently don't understand the purpose of mining in the first place. And you apparently never thought about SCALING - or did you ever do some basic calculations on this?
If you have "statecoin money" and want to have it managed in a decentralized fashion (i.e. decentralized ledger), it won't scale! Bitcoin today has a capacity of 2-3 transactions per second (the value of 7 tps is more theoretical) with 1 MB block size limit, and blockchain would grow by 53 GByte each year this way. Assuming 2.5 tps implies 79 Million transactions per year. Assuming that 316 Million people use statecoin (for comparison USA population=319 Mill, EU=500 Mill, Indonesia 250 Mill, and ignoring other entities like companies), it means that **everyone can make 1 transaction every 4 years** on average!!!
If you only want to allow everyone to make a transaction let's say twice a day, you would have to scale up by a factor of 2 * 365  *4=2920. This implies a Bitcoin blocksize of 2.9 GB, and a blockchain growth of 155 TByte each year. This is far too large to be decentralized,  only a few nodes would do the mining (and earn the mining rewards), but if it is centralized anyway, the state (or rather: central bank) could do it itself from the start.
Also transaction fees would be unacceptably high, everyone would compete to get his transaction into the scarce resource of the blocks, unless the block size is even much higher than what I have calculated.
Also, the central bank, when doing it in a central manner, does not necessarily have to store the history of all transactions in a blockchain manner - it could maintain a much simpler and more memory efficient database.

Then you are probably still young and naive. You can be sure I did more than just my homework. A scheme that promises 14% p.a. for a limited resource (bitcoin) WILL collapse! This is 100% sure. This is a ponzi, with mathematical certainty. Please do not fall for it.
You say it yourself! People borrowing your bitcoins are traders. If they lose, you won't get your bitcoins back, let alone the 14%.

since these certificates do not need to be backed by the underlying (btc) in reserve, the bank could make a fortune with the following manipulation strategy:
- buy some btc (an amount UNrelated to the investments in this certificate) before 15 Jul 2016.
- sell as many of these certs as possible to investors
- do NOT back them up with btc on reserve
- shortly before 16 Jul 2018, sell a significant amount of btc on the market to push btc price down
- on 16 Jul 2018 pay back investors a low amount of fiat acc to now low btc price.

The diagram is so dumb and unprofessional! Typical for blockchain.info!!!
If it was professional, it would describe what the graph displays, but it doesn't. So we don't know what the ordinate (y-axis) shows. fee per transaction? per block? per day? per 144 blocks? per week? per 2016 blocks? per month? per year?
every school kid learns that such diagram should clearly describe what the graph shows on each axis.
But blockchain.info amateurs do not even know the basics. So embarrassingly incompetent they are!!!

Definitly DOWN.
But openly tagging coins dirty would encourage anonymization techniques (like those of Monero or Dash for example) to be incorporated in Bitcoin (or users to move to other coins), which would be even worse for the authorities.
So I expect coin colorness to be used for chain analysis "under the hood" and no open/public black lists.

a bitcoin is not like a computer file that you can duplicate.
it is more like a ledger entry in your bank record, but the whole world is watching this ledger and you'd need enormous computerpower to change the ledger (and the next hour it would fill the headlines because the whole world can see that the ledger was changed by an attacker)

As far as I understand, he talks about the FUTURE (growth...), and in this case he's right: no whatever high tx fees can increase btc capacity to more than about one (!) on-chain transaction per earthling per earthling's lifetime. That's another way to put the 1 MB or the 3 TX/s.

No. Obviously you misunderstood something. If you were born before the year 2000 you should know that digital money existed long before Bitcoin. If you have a bank account and a debit card, and perhaps online banking - you use digital money! The ledger (database) never needed any "miners".
"Digital" simply means that the bookkeeping of account balances is done on computers and that there is less physical paper money than money on theses digital balances. That's all "digital money" means. Bitcoin and its decentralized blockchain technology is only one way of how to realize digital money, i.e. how to manage the ledger.
What I think Bitcoin can trigger is that central banks introduce new sort of "non-fractional reserve" central bank money for everyone. Up to now, the only legal entities that can hold account balances of digital central bank money are the private banks (and they need a bank licence), while any digital money owned by private persons or corporations (non-banks) is never central bank money but always a liability of a private bank (and hence endangered by bank runs and financial earthquakes).
@_date: 2016-07-24 14:04:45


Nobody can understand this. Can you please clarify the units? you say "a trillion TXs per person but per what time please? second? year? per person's lifetime?


if you introduce "tx capacity ~ log(population)" scaling, you accept that not every earthling can make a transaction. so scaling with log is certainly the wrong approach.
if you meant someting else, please express it more clearly.

My reply - and I insert in **[bold]** what I think you forgot to type: 


You are right that this is what I think, actually I am convinced that making a centralized system decentralized just because the "state" doesn't want to mange by itself  is very inefficient, and I think it is naive to believe that the state will launch an inefficient decentralized coin.


Based on which technical facts (other than "for the sake of argument") do you *assume* that blockchain systems can be scaled up by a factor of 3000 and more compared to Bitcoin today, in the *foreseable* future (lets say next 10-20 years, not talking about 100 year timeframe)? I think that it is evident that a system of this size makes no sense to be managed decentralized, so I think it is not a strawman argument but a very valid important argument to the matter being discussed, when taking reality into account.


I think that if dencentralized management of the network is too inefficient (which I assuem it is - not just "for the sake of argument" but based on technical facts) and therefore expensive, the state would not like to have this happen, because it would introduce unecessary costs that would flow to private operators of the network, payed by the users, money that should better flow to those parts of the real economy that really add value.
So it seems we have very different assumptions, mine based on technical/mathematical constraints, your "for the sake of argument", so I THINK it makes no sense to argue any further - all viewpoints are exchanged, *I think*.

Well, to add some facts &amp; data to the discussion:
- When I look at recent blocks (I randomly clicked some of the last 100 blocks [from here]( the **average TX fee is ca. 10-20 cent and more**:
 - [Block 412681]( 10 cent
 - [Block 412682]( 12 cent
 - [Block 412700]( 22 cent
 - [Block 412706]( 16 cent
 - [Block 412707]( 14 cent
 - [Block 412715]( 13 cent
 - [Block 412721]( 10 cent
 - [Block 412776]( 25 cent
 - [Block 412777]( 21 cent
 - [Block 412778]( 18 cent
 - [Block 412779]( 13 cent
 - [Block 412780]( 49 cent
 - [Block 412781]( 11 cent
[This graph]( confirms this trend (ignore the outliers from individual fees way above the normal levels). (Note that the values in that graph are not "USDs" but "USD-cents")
- When I prepare a transaction (small size(!), single address TX input, i.e. *no* large size "dust-collecting" transaction!) from my Mycelium wallet that has adaptive fee, I see:
 - Low Prio = 6 cent
 - Economy = 8 cent
 - **Normal fee = 15 cent** (used to be 5 cent only very few months ago!)
 - Priority = 53 cent
*And now please don't downvote me for just stating some facts!*

When you do the maths you see that current tx capacity amounts to pretty much exactly one on-chain tx per earthling per earthling's lifetime. That can't possibly be enough, unless you want a system where the VAST majority uses Bitcoin completely off-chain (even lightning usage would be impossible with this capacity).
If you still think that's ok, you are obviously not a proponent of a decentralized money system.
@_date: 2015-02-27 22:33:00
In that case it might in fact be purely digital. But this digital money is only available to the private banks, to no-one else (no people, no businesses, no companies, no corporations).
Only private banks have regular digital money in their bank accounts at the central bank today.
The other participants in the real economy don't have this possibility today, so it is absolutely correct to say that regular digital fiat does not exist in the *real economy today*. Sorry I was not that clear &amp; complete about this in my previous post - hope it is clearer now.

I would sincerely be interested in just one single conceptual attack vector of a malware located on the computer that Trezor is connected to. You can imagine an arbitrarily sophisticated SW - no limits. The requirement is that the user cannot see the attack when signing the transaction.
Today I am convinced that such a malware cannot exist by principle, no matter how sophisticated it is, because the amount and target address are displayed on Trezor (and not on the infected computer) and user signs by button-press on Trezor HW (and not on the computer HW).
But I am open for surprises - maybe it is too late and I am just missing something very fundamental.

One of Andreas' points is that once the attack becomes obvious in public (incl. markets), people (incl. markets) will reject the attacker's longest chain.
This equates to, at least temporarily, have a moratorium on the Bitcoin consensus rules, it is equivalent to the bitcoin community (people, markets, exchanges) setting a checkpoint on the blockchain to discard the "NSA chain" (as Andreas calls it) and continue working on the honest chain. Once the NSA (or whoever did the attack) sees that their chain is not accepted by the markets, they would stop mining expensive blocks nobody cares about. Then, the honest chain, while keeping growing, will overtake the stalled "NSA chain", eventually becoming the longest chain again.

hmm, nice idea, and I wish you success, but I have severe doubts:
Promising return of attractive interst rates in units of a deflationary currency could be problematic. where should the interest come from? if somone borrows 10 btc from your bank and has to pay back 11 btc after one year, could be problematic. even more so if btc appreciates vs. fiat in value. I expect lots of defaults - actually this is a must.
it is very different from fiat, where interests can be paid back always because of continued creation of new money out of thin air. this mechanism doesn't exist in bitcoin.
hence I predict that your business model won't fly long-term. in best case it just fails and goes bankrupt due to many non-returned loans. but also the possibility of a ponzi scheme is all but far-fetched. from the sole information given, this is very likely actually, based on past experience.

The article is not about Bitcoin, but about today's money system. As such it is a good article.
Just taking arbritrary articles about money and then bashing them because they don't mention bitcoin is a bit arrogant and simple (or even ridiculous), isn't it?
Bitcoin is still almost meaningless in the real economy, and when used, it is used as a payment network with exchange from/to fiat at both ends, or as speculative object.
Bitcoin is not acting as a curreny in real economy, so why should the author mention a side-effect (Bitcoin) instead of staying focussed on what money really is (today)?

It makes no sense to argue here. This leads to nowhere, except meaningless war. Both countries play by the rules of the money system. And it is part of the perfideous rules of this system that every once in a while the tensions get so big that something breaks. In this phase both debtor and creditor loose: debtor gets no more money as it did before and thinks that's unfair, yielding enormous social pains amongst the people if the debtor is a country. Creditor says "we want our money back, you have to deliver and not waste our money", and the people in the creditor country also are going to loose lots of money like their pensions savings when too many debtors cannot pay any more. There was simply too much systematical unkeepable promises to the people on both sides. And now they blame each other while the banking and money system gets away with it, because nobody really understands the money system (you neither, otherwise you wouldn't talk like that), which is because it is never teached at school anywhere.

Once they are equal competitors (if bitcoin keeps on stalling), there is no reason to assume that LTC's market cap won't become $1 larger than Bitcoin's.
And from there onwards, maybe $2 or $10, or even 10% higher. And from there even 20%, 50% etc. I mean, long term there is no natural limit at "50:50". It's only an illusion based on today's momentary situation, our brain tricks us.
If we really get that far that ltc market cap==btc market cap, it must have a reason. And for that very same reason (whatever it is) I bet it won't stop there...

I think you assume that I am referring to a big miner as a big company.
But actually I was thinking of a completely different analogy: Some "market forces" try to cut bitcoin into small pieces because they cannot make Bitcoin disappear. So making Bitcoin become small and unimportant is the best way to do it for them. Of course they do not do it in the open but try to separate the community, and Bicoin itself, into 2 and more fractions, with more or less subtle means. Psychology is a powerful tool for manipulating the people. Actually more powerful than money.

I was creative. Of course it would imply a hard fork with protocol change. It means if my TX has a TX fee of 1 mBTC that is included in block N of miner A, then miner A gets attributed only 0.3 mBTC by the protocol (instead of the full 1mBTC), whereas the miners mining on-top of miner A's block N get attributed...
* 0.25 mBTC for miner of block N+1
* 0.20 mBTC for miner of block N+2
* 0.15 mBTC for miner of block N+3
* 0.10 mBTC for miner of block N+4

my understanding of this chaos:
* btc1 and segsignal behave fully identical in July, August and September, as they support bip91.
  * In November, btc1 hardforks to 2MB, while segsignal doesn't.
* core does not know bip91 at all. It only knows bip141. As soon as the mechanism of bip91 causes segwit bip141 signalling on the longest chain to exceed 95%, segwit locks in on core. From that moment on (sometime in July/August?) core behaves identical to segsignal forever, while identical to btc1 only until sometime in November.
This means: for now running segsignal or btc1 makes no diference. if running btc1, on sould switch to segsignal or to core sometime in September to avoid HF in November.
...and now I completely forgot bip148 client:
* if bip91 miners follow through, bip148 client and segsignal client behave the same in August until forever...
* if bip91 miners betray, segwit does not activate and bip148 is the only way to enforce it.

Did I say so? No! I am not sure what you want to say with this, because that is not about the topic I talked about in the previous post. You could equally well have argued that the fact that Santa Claus' reindeer "Rudy" has a red nose does not necessarily imply that Rudy has an alcohol problem. That is undoubtedly correct logical reasoning, but neither is it in contrast to what I have posted, nor is it even related to my post.
My post was the reaction of your post. I re-quote your post (highlighting added):


So you said (I re-phrase it) that people spend money for bitcoins instead of real products and services (="other investments"), thereby harming the economy.
I weighed in that this is only true from the perspective of the particular bitcoin buyer. However, *macro-economically*, the (fiat) money that the buyer spends does not disappear from circulation but just changes hands! So the bitcoin seller has now new money to spend in the economy for goods and services. So overall the effect to the economy is neutral, it is just somebody else who makes the "investments". Thinking it even further, the effect might even be positive rather than just neutral, because the bitcoin seller might be in more need to spend the money than the bitcoin buyer would have been (the buyer, if he hadn't had the opportunity to buy BTC, might have just hodled the fiat money instead of spending it for goods &amp; services). So the macroscopic effect is possibly even positive.

I think even Bitcoin core would disagree with you. even they want a hf in a couple of years for scaling purposes beyond 1MB, as another friendly redditor on this subreddit explained me, and that I shouldn't make the mistake that opinions like yours (not meant negative!!) are representative if bitc core.
I respectfully disagree with you, because if I share a payment channel with 1 or 10 or 100 other people, I never own my own private key. of course it can be done, but then it is no better than a fiat bank account today where I would have to go via civil courts if I don't get my money back. Bitcoin would become more and more centralized, and hence meaningless over other cryptos that wouldn't be that restrictive on bsl. such an experiment would be irresposible to do with bitcoin and would change characteristics of bitcoin much more than a moderate (!) inctease of bsl ever could.
no innovation can change rules of maths.
every person must at least once in a lifetime own an own btc amount to start with, before opening a payment channel, or at least have the possibility to close it on-chain upon own trigger to get one's bitcoins.

There's a problem: If all exchanges suspend trading, no market price can form for one fork or another.
This implies that miners decide what Bicoin is and not the users/the market. This is a huge problem.
If we have something like UASF BIP 148, we'd need [exchanges to trade bip148 tokens]( in competition to legacy tokens, to see if a market majority wants the bip148 tokens (then it would be the trader's risk [not the ~~miner's~~ *(typo) exchange's* risk] to be left with a cancelled-out legacy token).

if you tink everyone should know because it is commonly known, you are either arrogant, or you believe in general truths that need not be proven because everyone know they are true, except the ignorants.

*Another user couldn't post this for technical reason. So I am posting this reply on his behalf because I think he is making some noteworthy points.*
*[comments by myself added in italics]*
Welcome to Reddit! 


If this belief is incorrect, it should be discussed openly and with technical specifics. *[I think this is a fair point]*
Core has shown that it is pathologically unwilling to do this. *[core would disagree, opinions are split on this, so lets put the arguments on the table]* I notice you don't list arguments against this contention. *[he's got a point here]*


Again, specifics, please. Why would raising or removing the block size limit be harder for a large business than, say, SegWit or LN? *[also I'd like to know this. e.g. spv wallets wouldn't even need to be upgraded from what I understood]*


Purposefully operating Bitcoin at an artificially maintained block size limit economically alters the system from how it has proved itself over 6.5 years. In fact, it even changes the original intent of that system. The fact is, there already are countering economic pressures which limit real block sizes that only get relieved as technology advances. A fixed limit does not even allow for the normal progress afforded by such technical advances. *[I concur that lack of adjusting the limit with technical progress is something I cannot understand either]*
Worse, Bitcoin's first-mover advantage is finite, and there is a growing universe of non-block size limited altcoins out there. Bitcoin may have a faction choosing to hamstring it, but I can assure you, others will not choose to do the same. *[I also think Bitcoin should not feel too save that it won't become the new Myspace if it is too ignorant and arrogant over crypto-competition]*


This is a complete red herring. SegWit and payment channels will work just as well (better in the case of LN) with increased block headroom. Raising the block size limit and scaling innovations are essentially orthogonal. 
*[I concur that different scaling solutions like SegWit and BSL increase do not exclude each other - it shouldn't be turned into an "either-or" discussion, thus would just cause unnecessary conclict. Note that btc classic project also wants to do SegWit, for example.]*


*[I would have preferred leaving this out altogether and discussing pragmatically instead. But since it was raised, the other user also wrote a reply:]*
I do hate tacit support of cen\*\*\*ship. I hate indifference to conflict of interest, particularly indifference to the colossal appearance of such that Blockstream casts over Core and by extension Bitcoin. I hate stalling and the refusal of open discussion. I hate that forthright, long-time supporters of Bitcoin such as Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik get abused and ostracized by an insular clique. *[I have the same impression about this last point]* I hate disingenuous speech and deceitful actions. I hate word-mincing and hairsplitting. I hate the perhaps not-so-tacit support of DDoS'ing and Sybil attacks on alternative clients. I hate, closed, backdoor meetings purportedly on behalf of an open, permissionless system.

You need to learn some basics about bitcoin first, then you'll know: Statecoin won't be minable by the public. Mining is needed only to secure the network of the decentralized ledger by POW. But statecoin would have a non-public central ledger (probably operated by the central bank), so mining is useless.
Also whether the digital statecoin money uses a blockchain or another kind of ledger / database, is not important.
Statecoin simply means:
- Digital money without a private bank standing between the central bank (cb) and the account holder.
- cb can directly determine the negative interest rate (or "account fee" or "demurrage") of the money, thereby having control over the money supply in a different, more direct way than before. The better-of the economy is, the lower these fess can be. So it would be a mechanism to control it country-specific.
- Everything is transparently visible for the cb or state, i.e. no tax evasion/money loundering like with cash.
- No bank run is possible on statecoin, because this electronic money is central bank money, and not a liability of a bank like todays's electronic fiat money.

Yes, and bitcoin miners must have the full sidechain blocjchain. How else should it work?!
imagine someone transfers one "sidecoin" back to the bitcoin chain. On the sidechain this happens via a certain transaction that destroys the sidecoin. Bitcoin miners have to observe the sidechain to identify this transaction to decide whether they can unlock a certain bitcoin (that was formerly locked) as a result from that sidecoin tx. So bitcoin miners have to be sure they really observe the correct, valid, transaction on the sidechan. But to be really sure that this is the correct sidechain transaction, they have to fully validate the sidechain. But this implies that they have to get all the recent blocks of the sidechain.
What would be the alternative? Bitcoin miners only observing the sidechain in spv mode? But then they wouldn't be 100% sure they really observe a valid sidechain. So they could also "trust" a full node of the sidechain to do the job, instead of doing it themselves. But this is not a solution in a trustless system. So however you twist it, eventually "someone" must validate the sidechain in full (non-spv) mode, and the bitcoin miners must "use" the outcome of this validation. If they are not doing it themselves, they must trust someone, and if this trust is misused, the sidechain is destroyed because not all sidecoins would be back-tranferable to bitcoin any more.

Asicboost lowers the energy cost per hash in that less cycles (computational operations) are needed for the same number of hashes. Less cycles per hash implies not only less energy consumption per hash but also less time per hash. As a result, you can compute more hashes in the same time with asicboost.

If other people repeat fairy tales (aka lies) that they had heard from other people, they should be informed that these are lies (aka untrue or false statements), and that they do not do Bitcoin a favour by repeating other people's lies.
Saying someone is "spreading lies" (aka "repeating untrue statemens heard somewhere else without checking") is does not necessarily imply that these people do this with bad intention - maybe they are not aware it is a lie and just repeating the false statement unchecked in the wrong belief that it is true. So we have to push people with their nose to smell the shit of their own statements, make clear that they are telling lies, if these are lies.

so you (like wu, ver, et al.) are against any other complementary scaling improvements to improve user count per blockchain size?

no. the point is whom I as a user trust. certainly i dont need to verify the whole blockchain - even today i don't do that - my smartphone uses spv or mycelium servers.
I know I *could* for very little money, and I know many private people do and check if all is all right (because they can - for very little money), and if something suspucious goes on, it will be in the headlines of reddit in no time.
So we have a great network of decentralized unorganized "verifiers and checkers" to make sure no censoring or suspucioys stuff like that goes on.
At 30GB blocksize and 1600 TB/year, this is no more possible. Now, a handful of huge corporation do the verification work and operate my "mycelium servers" - no room fir startups. There is a cartel and I have to trust them to behave decently. This is a whole different situation.
I wouldn't trust and wouldn't use such a network.

It is true until Bitcoin is *widely and commonly* agreed to be **money**, which is unfortunately(?) not yet the case. You cannot blame the author for that.
In the sense of the author, Bitcoin (even if he doesn't mention it) is a commodity (like Gold), and a pure Bitcoin payment (without exchange for fiat money before/after) would be barter. Based on the definitions in the article, Bitcoin has indeed the characteristics of a commodity like gold.

I agree with your arguments, but I am careful with the terminology "big / small blockers". Some people, who are of the exact same opinion as you call themselves *small* blockers.
I am also of your opinion, and I never (I hope) called myself neither big blocker nor small blocker.
Everybody has other definitions of these terms. I for my part define
* small blocker as someone who wants small blocks like 1 MB forever, or at least for the next 5-10 years.
* big blocker as someone who wants to have no block limit, wants to give miners the sole power to determine actual block size, and wants the ability of paying coffee on-chain world-wide.
I consider both extreme.
The right way is:
* First Segwit, then other means of protocol improvements to make bitcoin more efficient, both on bitcoin protocol level and with L2 solutions like LN or Sidechains. This means getting the most out of today's block size, and maximize adoption and utility while keeping Bitcoin decentralized.
* Then observe how the eco-system with wallets, SW solutions, user adoptions etc. evolves. (my personal vision here is that wallets like coinomi, electrum, mycelium, will onclude LN and RSK support incl. RSK&lt;-&gt;BTC swapping in one's own wallet, etc.)
* At some point, adoption will further increase. At that point increase of base blocksize is absolutely mandatory, because as even the inventors of LN have noted, for world-wide adoption, a block size like 200-300 MB is needed, and today's 1MB is just enough for every earthling to either open or close one(!) payment channel once(!) in a lifetime(!). This is realistic long-term, as technology will keep on evolving. But today this would mean making Bitcoin highly centralized. That's why the order of the steps matters.
Some will call me a small blocker because of my view, some will call me big blocker for my view. Funny.

I don't think so, because even after SegWit lock-in, the **hash rate penalty of 10-20% will not happen over night**.
You forget: Also after 1 Aug, after SegWit activation, Jihan &amp; Bitmain can still continue mining with asicboost. All they have to do is to NOT include SegWit transactions in their block! This way they can use the same mining algorithm as before!
In the begining, the number of Segwit transactions in the Mem-Pool will be small, and they do not lose a lot by disregarding them. Only after some time, once SegWit transaction become more frequent, they lose TX fee revenues by ignoring these transactions when building their blocks. **So the incentive to include (i.e. to not ignore) SegWit transactions when mining a block will gradually increase over time, after SegWit locks in.**

Again: Please learn how Bitcoin works. It is a decentralized protocol, not a company, and for the protocol to work properly, the incentives (for the miners) have to be set appropriately. It is as easy as that!
You cannot argue from the "customer" perspective alone. This way you will not make any progress.
Anyway, if Bitcoin continues to exist in the long-term, customers will use sidechain coins or off-blockchain-wallets (like coinbase) on the long term for everyday purchases (otherwise block size/blockchain growth does not scale), so the topic discussed here is anyhow a temporary one. And as of today, I think wheter a customer pays 0.5 cent or 2 cent tx fees is not too much of a difference.

BTC miners attacking RSK would be stupid, as they would reduce Bitcoin value.
Afaik, RSK is designed to be merged mined with BTC, which answers most of your question.
In general, we could also figure a sidechain that has a completely different mining algo, e.g. like the GPU/CPU based algo of Vertcoin. Indeed those miners would collect mining fees only, no block rewards, like Bitcoin miners. That's why this network would be less secure than BTC itself, and that is the idea. It cannot have the same security, and at the same time the sme utility as Bitcoin backbone network. So sidechain has less security (but still acceptable) but more utility (conf. time, fee).
Note: As RSK is used a lot, even with low fees, miner revenues will be much higher (measured in fiat) than most of the (lower-valued) altcoin miners earn today from block rewards.


Miners do not accept or refuse the exchange. These are normal transactions. Of course TX fees must be sufficient to be accepted, like any other BTC transaction.


Since it's not their BTC or RSK token, there's nothing they can do here. If they reject, they forgo the TX fees involved an lose profit.

* It would decrease overall network security because of increase of orphaning rate
Anyway speed is not critical as LN adn sidechains (like RSK) will be the future of using Bitcoin for payments where immediate confirmation speed matters, so the 10min pose no disadvantage at all w.r.t. block time.

Example of correct usage:

...as opposed to the frequent misunderstading (WRONG usage):
Ordinate value = 1000, ordinate label = "bit/USD"

that would be nice if true, and of course even LN needs bigger blocks.
but how does this fit together with the wide-spread propaganda that any HF is bad and hence must never happen?
I never saw any statement from a core dev distancing himself from this more wide-spread notion. it would be very easy for them if they had this intention.
Instead I saw promises broken and core devs moving more and more extremely to "1MB (forever)", while they used to be open to compromise (like 2/4 MB) some time before, but not any more.
Hence I do not trust core dev any more (where I leave it open whether I relate this lack of trust to their judgment or integrity - it may be different dpd. on the individual). This profound lack of trust does not come because I am a person so full if hate - I am not! It really comes from objective observation of the scene, the long track record of bitcoin-core behave objectively inacceptable by breaking promises and symphathizing with censorship autocratic mindsets that are absolutely inacceptable esp. for Bitcoin (but I know there are also people still trusting Mr. Erdogan or Mr. Putin or Mr. Trump - and not even few. This must be a malfunction in human brain, a blind spot for the obvious evil. Same reason why A. Hitler had so many followers who really trusted him).
I don't want to make wrong accusations, but also I am not naive. And to the very best of my understanding, and with only best intentions, I can say that this is my impression. And I am all but happy with this "evolution to smaller blocks" (with "smaller" I mean the outspoken targeted ideal block size limit, not the actual [the actual is 1MB since years of course]).

Thanks for this Info! So I enter literally, for example, including the parantheses:
OP_RETURN (feed1234beef5678), 0
Right? Then will the 80 bytes be zero-padded if I enter less than 160 hex numbers, like in above example? Or is it "up tp 80", and if entering less, the tx contains less than 80 bytes to save space?
Since that tool is called "pay to *many*", so can I concatenate several outputs in one tx this way, like:
OP_RETURN (feed1234beef5678), 0, 1someRealBtcAddressG74Sw5bVMGg, 1.5
Is that the correct syntax?
Then this would be exactly my solution, if I want to give a 1.5 BTC gift to her paper wallet "1someRealBtcAddressG74Sw5bVMGg", replacing "feed1234beef5678" with the sha256 hash of my declaration text file.

I am sorry but you are blind for reality. What you say is true for cryptos as a whole, but not for Bitcoin in particular. If Bitcoin community keeps this arrogance, Bitcoin will become a footnote in history while other cryptos take over.
No law of nature guarantees Bitcoin to prevail - when will you ever learn this - probably even if Bitcoin's crypto market cap is less than 5%, you will still say that these other cryptos are in a bubble and Bitcoin is the one and only real thing.
This kind of dumb arrogance reminds me soooo much of Peter Schiff and other gold bugs TODAY who claim that Bitcoin and cryptos is a bubble and only gold is the real thing. They'll still say it when crypto market cap equals or surpasses gold market cap, they will still think in zealot manner that gold is the only real thing.
How is it NOT possbile to see the identical mindset of these "gold bugs from yesterday" who have not understood the wind has changed, and the mindset of the "Bitcoin-only ideologists" who have not understood that Bitcoin's leadership cannot be taken for granted and is not an automatism.

So we should keep things in perspective to remain credible in general.
If you list 10 arguments and one is wrong or appears to be "tuned" to "look better", also the other nine arguments lose credibility amongst neutral readers, even if those, by themselves, are perfectly right.
At least that is how I jusge other people's credibility: I look what they say about topics I know about. And if they are inaccurate/manipulative/biased, I expect them to be the same for topics I know little about.

Your problem is you bought because of greed, not because of comprehension.
Usually, people like you buy the wrong stuff (here: lots of alts, because bitcoin is not good enough...) at the wrong time, and then sell what they should keep, and then they lose everything.
Ask yourself self-critically if this is somewhat applicable to you, and draw the right conclusion.
One conclusion could be to get your hands off stuff you do not understand. Another conclusion could be to truely educate yourself.

Oh, ONE question only, sorry, let me rephrase:
What is the value of the complex number C, where C is defined as C=A+j*B, where
* A = the ON-chain capacity in tx/s (excl. LN and sidechains), and

after segwit activation there can still be blocks without segwit, and there will be many non-segwit transactions for a long time. On the first day, almost all transactions will still be non-segwit transactions, and then the percentage of segwit transactions will gradually increase as wallets start to support segwit and users updatge their wallet software. But users can continue using their old (non-segwit) wallets as long as they want, it will always be valid.

You obviously do not understand how payment channels and LN works.
I DO WANT to control how much Bitcoins I put ionto the LN channel.
I do not want that the app decides this for me.
Same way I want to decide myself how much money I shoft from my savings to my spending account, I do not want my bank to decide that for me. The bank cannot know how much I want to spend. Note that every opening of LN channel cost me on-chain BTC fees, so only loading the channel with the amount of the current spending gives no advantage in terms of fees over direct normal on-chain payments.

Indeed. It reminds me a little bit of the old Bitcoin critics saying:
Bitcoit has no inflation, it is in fact a deflationary currency, so its value increases over time, and because of that, nobody spends it, and because of that it is a bad means to by things, i.e. it is a bad currency because of that. And because it is a bad currency, it cannot have value, so it's value must decreases and it is doomed.
*In short: Because its value is increasing, its value must decrease!*
In comparison:
As bitcoin adoption increases, fees increase, and this will reduce adoption and doom it.
*In short: Because its adoption is increasing, its adoption must decrease!*

So the message is put into the OP_RETURN output with its up to 320 bits or 80 bytes. Then I urgently suggest (if you haven't done that already!) to be able to select in the GUI for the message field the encoding type: ASCII or HEX.
If ASCII is selected, e.g. the letters "A" and "a" will be encoded as 8-bit decimal 65 and 91 respectively, or binary 01000001 and 01011011, wheras for HEX, the letter "A" or "a" will be translated into 4-bit decimal 10, or binary 1010.
*edit: further encoding options like base64 or even base58 could be added, too, of course. But I think HEX is mandatory for including things like sha hashes, and ASCII for including plain text.*

Yes. The problem is that most people are not educated about the difference between "central-bank-money" and "debt-money [=IOUs]", so they cannot agree about something they are not even aware of.
The fact that both is referred to as "money" and both use the same unit of account ("EUR", "USD", ...) [both in universities and mass media], makes it hard for people to get a grasp of the reality of the money system.
When banks default and people's "debt money" gets lost, people usually say "the bank stole my money". This is best proof of people's misconception. If they understood, they would say "the bank broke its promise to pay me back my money that they were never meant to have in the first place".

True in theory.
Practically, I don't see a conflict between miners and clients.
Miner hardfork and client acceptance is likely coming together! First miners will ensure that the stakeholders (exchanges btc companies, users, ...) accept the hardfork by social means (yes, by "talking"), then miners will do the hardfork.
Hence the HF scenario is, e.g., likely to succeed for 1MB-&gt;2MB hardfork, but unlikely to succeed for a HF of the total 21 Mill supply.

Yes. Go educate yourself and find out what labels mean and how to read them and how they are used everywhere in financial charts, before writing nonsense. Thanks.
For the others readers passing by here and willing to learn, here is some explanation:
If the label on the ordinate (vertical axis or y-axis) says "USD/bits" and the value is "1000", then it means:
USD/bit = 1000, or more elaborately    
1 USD / 1 bit = 1000, which is equivalent to    
1 USD = 1000 bits, which is equivalent to    
1000 USD = 1,000,000 bits, which is equivalent to    
1000 USD = 1 BTC.
This makes sense for some time span of 2017.
Conversely, if the label on the ordinate (vertical axis or y-axis) says "bits/USD" and the value is "1000", then it means:
bit/USD = 1000, or more elaborately    
1 bit / 1 USD = 1000, which is equivalent to    
1 bit = 1000 USD, which is equivalent to    
1,000,000 bits = 1,000,000,000 USD, which is equivalent to    
1 BTC = 1 billion USD.
This makes no sense (yet).

* 1) Which is the max block height that can be expressed, and what year does it correspond to?
* 2) What is the max date in terms of unix time that can be expressed? Which year is it?
* 3) If I generate an nLocktimed TX to 1myTestAddressXyzAbcde with nLocktime = 1.1.2020 and I broadcast it to the bitcoin blockchain today (30.05.2019), will the miner include it in a block today (or tomorrow), or would such a block be invalid and it could only be included in a block on 1.1.2020?
* 3b) If it can be included already today: Can I broadcast a double-spend (so to say) without nLocktime (or with an earlier date) that a miner could include in a competing block 3 days later, on 2nd June 2019? (also to 
1myTestAddressXyzAbcde in this example)
* 3c) If yes: If the owner of 1myTestAddressXyzAbcde spends his bitcoins no earlier than say 5 Jan. 2020, has he the choice whether he uses the UTXO of the TX from 30.05.2019 or the one from 2nd June 2019? If not, then what is the rule here?

What you are writing is so half-baked and completely detached from reality!


Easy to write. Can you elaborate: What block size you are suggesting exactly? What maximum? What do you mean by "tx fees take place of block reward". Be very precise, or your word are not worth anything, because your maths cannot add up, if you think otherwise, give number that add up acc. to your opinion. Otherwise, it is just a half-baked dream - and this is exactly what it is, sorry, but it cannot work.


You still don't understadn that charging users onyl 10 cent per TX for worldwide adoption adn decentralization at the same time is NOT possible. sorry, but that's reality. Hiow mcuh cent per TX is what you call an arm and a leg? please, again, be precises and concrete, otherwise nobody can take you serious and you jsut prove to dream half-baked dreams.


That shows you don't understand anything. Educate yourself about sidechains like RSK and LN. RSK is exactl the bitcoin that you want. It has 200 MB/block or so equivalent capacity, and TX fees will be low. It is no extra coin but shares its market cap with bitcoin, and has much lower tx fees. Of course it will be less centralized than Bitcoin but that is not problem for you, because you think bigger block size is no problem for decentralization. And even better, if you change your mind, you just exchange RSK for BTC for your saving account, and done.

It will, if on-chain tx fees are too big. If there is demand to get a few mRSK without paying the high Bitcoin network TX fees, at this moment there is an end-user demand for being able to buy mRSK tokens directly. AS simple as this. market fill figure it out.


That's my point: merchants will accept RSK as they accept BTC. But users will prefer using RSK as it has much lower fee, and also much faster confirmation time.

One minor remaining question about the zero padding: So it does NOT pad to 80 bytes. But does it pad to full bytes? If I enter        
OP_RETURN abc, 0        
will it generate 2 bytes = 16 bit like for "0abc", or will it generate 12 bits?

Research shows that this kind of prediction w.r.t. fiat money exists since decades. Still no collapse happened.
I think it is realistic to assume that the collapse - as it did not happen before in the past decades (although every year "things were different this time"), it won't happen the decades to come, and hence not in our lifetime.

Bitfinex is irrelevant, this is commonly known, because the currency pair there is not BTC/USD any more but uses a crypto dollar that is worth less than 1 USD.
Similar to end of 2013, when BTC  MtGox prices where consistently higher than other exchanges bitcoin prices, because users could not withdraw USD.
TL;DR: So **markets that do not allow full arbitrage** with other markets, **like Bitfinex** these days/weeks or MtGox back then, **should be completely ignored** for official price tags!!!

You do not look three steps ahead - not even two steps. The question is not about whether a singular 2MB will decentralize Bitcoin. The question is whether a continuous block size increase, every time the block size limit is met, will decentralize Bitcoin eventually.
If you really think "2 MB once" will solve the problem, you understand nothing.
The demand for low fee Bitcoin is MUCH higher than even 10 or 20 MB blocks. If Bitcoin succumbs to any such demand increase, decentralization is doomed and you end up with yet another Ripple!
So we MUST first make use of all other techniques to make Bitcoin more efficient, and only thereafter we can scale. Side chains is one example of such other techniques (if Lightning does not fit your use cases), and is MUCH better for coffee payments than Bicoin on-chain (so is lightning by the way).
The good thing is that after having made Bitcoin more efficient, each on-chain scaling in terms of base blocksize increase will have a bigger adoption effect as if you do it now. So the ratio "delta bitcoin value/delta blockchain increase" gets much greater that way. That's what we need to make best usage of Bitcoin and leverage its properties and potential.
But if you increase blockchain already now without taking these other measures, that ratio is much worse.
Many people do not understand that, it is just too complicated for their simple minds. Interestingly, non of the independent core developers belongs to this group. Others could understand it but have not yet thought about it properly. Yet others understand it very well but want Bitcoin to become centralized and hence want Bitcoin to move in this direction intentionally.
For me, or any other standing on the sidelines, it is nearly impossible to tell which person belongs to which category...

Don't make it so complicated. This just hides your error.
Y-axis (or diagram title) labled "BTC/USD" means that the value on the y-axis equals "BTC/USD", and that's it.
Clearly, your intention is that the value on the y-axis indicates "USD/BTC", not "BTC/USD", so your label is wrong.

He says that claims that nobody supports bip148 and all support SW2x is ridiculously wrong.
He further says he respects the "no" responses to bip148 because he considers those cautious responses to avoid risk (e.g. Greg's reasoning).
He implies that he, personally, is still pro bip148 because the alternative is bitmain corporate coin or a slow Bitcoin-death because of no progress at all.
So he has a differentiated view and is no radical on one side or another. Sounds reasonable to me. Maybe you are irritated because most people are radical on one side or the other, and if someone is not radical, you are irritated in the sense of "what side is he standing at?"

Other example:
Chart title and ordinate label = "USD/JPY".
Ordinate value = 110.
* Incorrect reading: "You get 110 USD per JPY", which is mathematically equivalent to "110 USD / 1 JPY = 1" or "110 USD = 1 JPY".
* Correct reading: "USD / JPY = 110", i.e. "1 USD / 1 JPY = 110 / 1", i.e. "1 USD = 110 JPY".


It's not "ass-backward", if you know why it is like that. It is strictly mathematical - all charts are treated equal, the ordinate value elways EQUALS the "thing" that is the label of the ordinate (or the headline of the chart).
Another example: x-axis label = date, y-axis label = ordinate label = chart title = "temperature in degrees centigrade".
Ordinate value = 25.
* Correct reading: "temperature in degree centigrade = 25", or more mathematically "temperature / °C = 25", because the word "in" in the ordinate label or title is actually mathematically a division ("/"). So by multiplying the equation with "°C" on both sides we get: "temperature = 25 °C", and clearly this is what the charts wants to tell us.
* Incorrect reading (and THIS would be ass-backwards): "I have 25 temperatures in centigrade" or "I get 25 temperatures per centigrade" or "25 temperatures / centigrade = 1", i.e. "25 temperatures = 1 °C", i.e. "temperature = 1/25 °C = 0.04 °C", which is certainly not what the creator of the temperature chart wants to tell.
So all charts follow the same mathematical logic, no matter if they denote exchange rates or physical quantities. That's why there can only be one correct way of labelling exchange rate charts, and that's the way how yahoo finance and everyone else in the industry is doing it.

No I don't misunderstand.
I am just of the opinion that the word of a leading core-dev on bcore roadmap is not meaningless to bcore roadmap. So the core dev's word stands for something. That's a no-brainer.
It's about human communication, which is real. You don't need someone who "dictates" for this, and I never implied this. Real people make real decisions in bcore and you can read the results of these decisions in bcore source code. Whether these decisions within bcore are made via voting or veto or other means is of secondary relevance - but the real decisions are made SOMEHOW INSIDE B-CORE.

semantics. in brief yes.
more elaborate: My impression from the public data availble to me is that relevant influential bcore member(s) expressed the intention or plan to provide 2MB by 7/2016. My impression is that there even is a written doc with (digital or handwritten) signature capturing this. My understanding is that such statements mean someting, esp. in Asian culture, even if not legally binding. My impression and understanding is that now some stakeholders (incl. Chinese miners) feel fooled and bcore signers have no good explanation why the "promise" (if you allow me to call it like that) was broken, except saying that it was no promise and by no way legally binding, which is a bad way to treat partners. what's the purpose of setting up and sign a written doc if it's moot anyway?
Of course I cannot proof it (like I cannot proof that antarktica really exist - I haven't seen it with my eyes). But to the best of my own judgement and my senses I can say this is most likely what it is.

PS: Edit: More thoughts on BTC and RSK:
I am also well envisioning a situation where, for a casual user who owns 1 BTC in his "savings account" and say 0.001 RSK in his "spending account" (1RSK = 1BTC via 2-way-peg), if this user wants to load another 0.001 BTC from his BTC savings account to this RSK spendings account, he may decide NOT to do this on-chain and pay Bitcoin TX fees, but use instead a normal exchange that trades both BTC adn RSK tokens! This may cost him less fees than the on-chain fees.
In fact, this is exactly what I EXPECT to happen! Most of you will say that is stupid, but to those of you I must tell you cannot think ahead and envision scenarios in your mind (and I am sorry for you, but no worries, you belong to the majority of people).
But it is quite clear: On the one hand, we'll have the 2-way peg, which, long-term, will guarantee a balance of BTC and RSK tokens being valued the same. On the other hand, small changes between RSK and BTC will not be worthwhile as they cost too much on-chain TX fee. So users will use normal exchanges instead and change BTC into RSK, or the other way round, like they were two different coins. In fact, depending on demand and supply, the exchange rates between BTC and RSK will not EXACTLY be 1.0:1.0, but may somewhat deviate from 1.0:1.0. However, it will not deviate too much, because if it DOES deviate too much, bigger traders (possibly even the exchange operators themselves) will make arbitraging by swapping RSK to BTC on-chain, where they get the exchange ratio of 1:1, guaranteed by the protocol, and only pay the TX fee, which is small (percent-wise) if they swap big amounts. So for swapping big amounts between BTC and RSK, on-chain is the way to go, but for swapping small amounts, exchanges are the way to go.
Nice side effect: For many BTC-RSK exchanges, the block chain will not even be used, as it will by off-chain. This further decreases the on-chain load.
Another side-effect is coin supply and price: As Bitcoin fees increase, less and less often will people (users) be willing to exchange BTC for RSK, but instead just aquire RSK directly (maybe even for fiat) where RSK TX on-chain fees are low. Now, RSK instead of BTC are used for most on-chain transactions because of the much lower TX fees. So effectively, RSK will be the paying-coin (as BTC used to be), and BTC will be the savings-coin (or "hodling-coin"). This means the amount of RSK that will actually be usable for transactions will be much smaller than 21 Million, because only a certain fraction of the Bitcoin coin supply is locked in BTC and availiable in RSK. This further decreases coin supply (of RSK "usage coin") and hence is another driving force to increase the Bitcoin price...
