I know right.. currently im leaning towards 40%... but it would be so nice if it would fall after this rush and could buy low. But maybe it will keep rushing to like 8,5k and then make a fall down to 7,5k, then it would still be wiser to get in now.

I can dig that, absolutely. In the long term I will hodl. The only way not to loose money on this fork is to predict better than most, and that is not easy, am I qualified? Nope. Can it be worth trying anyway when I, as you say, will take part of plenty of future gains? Yes. But dont you personally think the market will shake more than usual around the 16th?

I thought as much. I keep getting a "failed"-message. I have enough funds, it's within the allowed limit and I have contacted the bank and they see no reason it shouldnt work.. I am bit clueless now..

Trying to buy BTC with credit card, I cant see an option to transfer money to coinmama to then use there?

Im in a similiar situation, have a fraction in BTC and keep watching it grow. I'm fighting the urge to go all in because of the fork that I feel that I not fully understand.

I have no real idea if this is stupid or not. But if it isnt Im gonna do it too ^^. To me it sounds clever and beats the whole keeping it in a bank valve idea in case of fire in your home.

So your advice is?
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:32:36

Is it simple to transfer my BTC over to my Ledger if I purchase them ahead of me having the actual Ledger?
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:49:14
But wouldnt the FOMO be kind real then?

Sorry for my limited language here, but what is increments?
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:07:37
All time high

Have followed it for like a month and it is growing pretty fast... but you wouldnt say I am missing something obvious then?

That pic is only implying that there will be a dip after each ATH, but keep climbing?
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:08:51
Aye ofc
