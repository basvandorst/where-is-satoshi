You can't "lose" a Bitcoin. Bitcoins are simply accounting data on the blockchain. What you can lose is the private key which entitles you to move a certain number of Bitcoins from one address to another in the blockchain ledger. If you let someone else control your keys (like an exchange) then you are outsourcing the security of your wealth. In the digital world, this is a risk. Therefore its desirable to send your Bitcoin to an address in which you control the private key. Then take note of the private key and safeguard it using physical security (like a home safe or ironically enough, a bank safe deposit box).

Thanks, so what does trigger activation? I understand miners (hash power) ultimately but I thought BIP 148 was a way to get miners to change based on which blocks nodes will adopt. I'm just trying to understand the mechanics of the 8/1 event so I can better prepare.
