You know I have to be honest I did think about the possibility this is some scammy exit strategy. They have a fairly successful business though. With the growth of bitcoin it was only going to get better. I can’t see how that can be the case unless it’s a single rouge employee who did it.  
Hopefully we will get more info very soon.

You can’t live life on what ifs. Seriously what if’s will chew you up and spit you out. Had you bought bitcoin at only a dollar you probably would have sold when it reached thirty and be having similar thoughts about why you should have stayed in it.  
Just buy what you don’t mind losing and don’t touch it for 10 years.  
It’s still not to late.

It’s just a tracker. You have to manually type everything in. But the layout is nice and it quickly tells you at a glance how much your either up or down. It does a bunch of alt coins too.  
I’m using coinbase for my purchases and then I also have a some btc sitting in my nicehash wallet.  
Researching wallets now to figure out where I want to store it.

There is a separate account for potential college if that’s what they wish to do. I don’t know if I have the balls to put that money in bitcoin too.

Ahh what a coincidence that it’s very similar amounts. Well in that case good luck to you too. Hopefully bitcoin treats us plebs well.

I have a 980ti video card. It only makes about $2 a day. Then you have to minus electric cost so it’s even less. But I have it setup to run when my system is idling so it’s just a little extra bitcoin from an otherwise un-used pc.
I would not suggest the laptop or the pi for Nicehash. It will create to much heat and possibly cause damage or degrade your components. More than likely it would not net you much at all.

No I’m not pulling it out yet. It’s still in the Nicehash wallet. I’m just tracking it by making it look like I purchased the same amount of BTC in coinbase that was deposited by Nicehash. I then check what time it was deposited and use TradingView to figure out what the high was for that minute on Coinbase and then use that as the BTC cost.

Greetings r/bitcoin. I know I’m late to the game but this Friday I’ll start a recurring purchase for $25. This along with my PCs idle time on Nicehash will hopefully get me going. I probably won’t be able to get a Tesla or lambo but maybe when my toddler is old enough for a car I’ll pay for it in bitcoin.

Electric is about .077. I have really thought about that but the roi could potentially be 8 months. Maybe shorter if the coin that is being mined it held and has a decent jump.  
But everywhere I read says to skip the mining rig and just invest cause the market will beat out the rig most of the time.

I do like that idea. I might have to look into that. Thanks!

I wish there was something creative I was good at. The one thing I really do enjoy is building PCs. But not many people will pay you to do that since it’s way cheaper to buy a prebuilt from a retail store.  
But I’ll keep looking for something interesting to do on the side.  
Got any suggestions?

That’s awesome. Looks like your mining more than I. What are you mining with and for who?

It’s called Blockfolio. It’s a really nice app for keeping track of everything. I found it from another redditor. It’s nice for tracking gains from when a purchase was made.
