What if people are selling alt coin for Ethereum instead of Bitcoin?
Because is what happening right now

Litecoin will become a beast along side with Bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-01-23 11:18:57
- CME contracts will end at 26 January 2018;
-  at 26 January 2018;
-  at 27 January 2018;
- Lighting network are already in use in some main global exchanges(eg. Bitflayer);
- Major exchanges will announce soon segwit adoption;
- 6 Korean banks are aiming to simultaneously open/allow deposits and withdrawals to exchanges as of 30 January 2017;
So , why FOD when future is still bright?

what will happen tomorrow when coinbase will add BCH/BTC for trading? How much it will infect bitcoin value?
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:59:49
We got an decline event yesterday which the bottom is 9.5k  and sure we will get a bouce that will drive us to 12k-13k, after that we will have Post Bouce Decline that will drop Bitcoin value until 9.5k again at same level that happened yesterday.
I don't think 7-8k will happen at least in this month and i hope that it will never happen lol.
@_date: 2018-01-26 09:41:23
Can be used by EU people?
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:36:32
the question is, will major exchanges like coinbase will support LN in their wallets?
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:32:28
With DDM Bitcoin exchange platform  to be launched in 11 January, it will be wise to hold and not sell.
I hope in this Friday we can see a huge bullish.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:15:05
true, 11k is very saleable for me to buy cheaper in upcomming days.
We are in 100% bear market right now, dont expect miracles until next 5 days.
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:18:34
There are no nacionalism and communism like in China, so don't need to be worried about South Korea.
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:32:34
I also thought the same, 
All i know is Litecoin will use Lightning network too and will be first to implement it in mainnet.
google source:
"Note that the Lightning Network spec is still in flux with compatibility only for Bitcoin and Litecoin currently being developed. Monero is not compatible with the Lightning Network (lacks script support, has different timelock model, multisig works differently, etc), therefore this question makes little sense today. That being said, the Lightning Network protocol (for Bitcoin) will enable Onion Routing which will help aleviate the IP address concern. Subaddresses should aleviate the concern a…"

that 100k $ can turn 1 million in 2040 , when 1 santoshi = 1 $, i think bitcoin was designed for that propose.
Only who can dream high can't reach high.
People that are in ignorance dont even know what bitcoin is.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:02:11
its a part of ecosystem, people got greddy and moved to altcoins and attacked Bitcoin from behind saying Bitcoin is old tech , slow , outdated etc.
But they didnt knew that if bitcoin goes down all altcoins will follow because Bitcoin is official currency for altcoins.
We only going to see a healthy  green in altcoins again when bitcoin atleast get 51% dominance from all cryto market.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:39:44
In terms of market cap maybe, but not in value lol, no other crypto will reach 10k $ + ever.
And if is there any crypto that can overtake bitcoin this year in terms of market cap it will be Ethereum.
@_date: 2018-01-11 09:20:29
What if i told you that China will come again in cryto business and will ban again?
is like the definition of insanaty , doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:15:57
it could be a good win, let see in upcomming hours
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:59:54
Perhaps i used my sentence wrong to explain, what i ment to say is Litecoin being dummy coin of Bitcoin , so before any deploy of Bitcoin in real world, Litecoin usualliy make first to see how its works.
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:10:20
crypto panic:
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:25:21
95% inclination
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:41:44
Bitcoin soon 40% Dominance vs 32% last week
@_date: 2018-01-04 09:14:01
let me correct your sentence:
"The only reason exchanges don't use segregated witness is because it will decrease drastically the profits that exchanges make with fees"
@_date: 2018-01-13 10:44:00
1 santoshi = 1 USD in 2040.
Cya in 22 years when 1 BTC holder could become millionaire and this bugatti would cost 0.5BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:26:02
well i hope they fix it too.
Imagine Exchanges with LN and Segwit implemented, that will be huge!
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:28:46
7k is only reachable if South Korea or Japan  or America ban cryto trading like China did.
Good luck for that mate ;)
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:09:20


so true
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:23:08
I think whales are calibrating the value of market to see the real resistance price.
So far we can see  that must of altcoins droped like 30% and bitcoin droped 15%.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:56:58
As expected , they woke up in panic
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:25:16
the question is:
Will coinbase and other major exchanges will support LN?
I´m telling that because coinbase  still don´t support Segwit yet...
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:00:59
Pahaps this Friday will be more bright than last week's Friday.
We will see how DMM Bitcoin exchange can influence the market.
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:41:38
Im thinking the same.
And is not the first we heard this thing/schema, its happing a lot of time , but this time it wil be huge.
We will have a bearish days until end of the week , after that we may get some surprise.
Ether Hodl or buy , sell is not a good option atm
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:46:17
India represent 10% of all Bitcoin transations in world.
A lot if Indians Black money(millions $$$) are stored in Bitcoin , government is checking it right now and are banning cryto from all major Indian banks.
I think that is the major reason that we are facing this dip in those last weeks.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:37:17
Im telling that if bitcoin reach 1 million dollars in value , 1 santoshi value will be equal 1$ USD 
@_date: 2018-01-11 09:17:21
Altcoins are Gambling. Bitcoin is not.
And when bitcoin will reach trillion market cap it will become more stable.
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:42:24
it not necessary comes to Bitcoin , it also can be converted in Ether or USDT(Tether).
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:53:28
Someone did good homework to explain this fork scam:
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:25:33
bitcoin chash may still just a little better than  real Bitcoin atm, but only till  final December.
After lighting network and segwit in coinbase wallet , say farewell to btrash.
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:40:18
I know, your explanation makes sense.
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:10:17
Fake. Come on, just look at the team, they just cant this kind of Fork.
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:55:35
Here we go again...
I just going to copy paste what i said in other posts:
"Or is Fake or is already Dead project. Come on, just do some research and see this Segwit2x team profile. I tried to find Founder's professional profile in google and only found him in some dating website..."

Renewable energy or mining all Bitcoins till limit capacity.
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:43:55
good and big exchanges will hardly accept craps like XRB and IOTA, they have same advantages but they truly have big problems that are hiding from public such as being centralized and DAG based...
Like Vitalik said :
"Projects that claim that have instant translations , no fees and scalability are either scam or are hiding big problems from public with zero knowledge of correct technology.
There are no  such technology created yet for that, only thing i see is a graveyard for those coins that are scam and claiming that are instant , zero feesless  and scalable."
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:40:20
IOTA is one of Altcoins that guarantee scalability, zero fees and instant translations , but being centralized i cant see how that can be true when becomes mainstream.
Only thing i can see is a graveyard for this bunch of Altcoins that are telling that already have  scalability, zero fees and instant translations for long term.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:34:56
let me correct the title:
-FACT: Tonight is the FIRST 40%+ correction of 2017. Calm down
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:04:41
Its possible true those guys from wall street are pros in trading, no one in the wold are better than them.
What you think it will happen when amateurs vs pros happen?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:07:19
i survived from this bear trap.
What is happening now is much deeper and complex...
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:06:15
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:44:16
touched the dip yesterday (15k$), it will recover soon, i predict that it will start tomorrow night.
lets see

@_date: 2017-12-20 10:56:22

@_date: 2017-12-28 15:55:51
Bitcoin got many bull traps this week, i counted atleast 3 of them in past 5 days.
And i expect more bull traps in next 3 days.
After that we will have new chapter of Bitcoin history, i just cant tell if is good or bed but in 2018 we will see many suprieses.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:42:28
there is no alternative, coinbase is still the best .
-best support,
-best mobile app;
-best mobile app;
-good web wallet and very secure;
-no fees between coinbase and gdax;
-they can increase more than 50k $ limit instant withdraws between coinbase and gdax(just need to request them);
-good review(search in google -&gt; coinbase review);
The other option you have is bittrex, all other exchenges are not safe, secure or stable.

Scam or fake.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:00:02
what wrong with Korea news?
The panic in Korea is already over , why this panic delayed in Europe and America?
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:47:21
if bitcoin goes dip, all altcoins will foloow including Bcash.
So if bitcoin drops below 15k$ , Bcash could drop at 2k $.
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:54:01
Well , since when a centralized is better than descentralized coin?
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:40:17
Preper the graveyard , we will see all lot of dead altcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:16:43
that news is old: Nov 16, 2017
That hard fork already got canceled , this new one is a scam so be careful!
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:48:11
Or is Fake or is already Dead project.
Come on, just do some research and see this Segwit2x team profile.
I tried to find Founder's professional profile in google and only found him in some dating website...
