That's certainly more palateable number. Not gonna lie, no fee amount will get me to use your service on principle but I do hope you succeed in making your statement and getting your point across to amazon. Maybe you can lessen it even more. (Obviously someone like me would be unhappy until it is 0% and you just DO IT).

Just sit on them. Don't sell. You don't need the money. Just sit on them like a grandmother who hid her jewelry in the floorboards. You will thank me in the years to come. Trust.

Linux is tedious. 100% of the time you have a problem you can expect that problem to eat vast amounts of time. Although this does worry me, I don't have time for tinkering with linux to get my printer to work or my offbrand flash drive to recognize or to get this beta client to run. My time is more precious to me than my privacy. For now. That said I am always open to a better way of doing things. If a better way of doing things comes along I will be the first one on that train.

I'm really pissed that I committed to a giving a good birthday present to a friend this week. Otherwise I would be dumping $400 in my mtgox account and watching my money grow. This week has been torture. No money and watching all that money I could have had had things been different. Feels bad man. I'm missing my millionaire's chance...Should I just break my promise?
@_date: 2013-06-21 16:52:40
I deleted my Facebook done months ago for many reasons and I've only felt more and more secure in my decision as time passes. It was logged into from an IP not my own and that was that. It helped that I don't actually enjoy using the service and was already privacy-minded to begin with.

Thanks. I didn't know any of that. And such a great song/video. :)

What I mean by precision is the soundness of the variables taken in to account. You took only a handful of factors. I believe there to be more things that can be taken into account. At least three. Meaning your margin of error is 50% or greater. Imprecise. As for accurate predicting, any predicting is just that: a fool's errand. Cool tool. I was expecting the values to be higher. I'm not sure if that's because of a cursory calculation on your part or due to the wild expectations I was given during the April bubble but in any case it's shown me that I need to buy more bitcoins. That can only be good.

To be honest with you, there is no one in the world at the moment who I want to communicate with. I'm under going an academic hermit phase and I realized only yesterday that I feel completely free because there is absolutely nothing tying me to where I am. I imagine I might make a facebook again in the far future when I decide to throw in my lot with another person (marriage) but that would be only to blend in. To appear like a normally functioning human in society. But I'm happy. Really happy. Deleting my facebook allowed me to pursue things and not tell anyone. I'm reading a lot. Eating better. Working out. Getting shit down and letting the satisfaction be it's own reward. That's why I tell people they can do without facebook. I'm probably a special case.

You should delete your account. All your backposts, likes, political leanings, etc. are still ON the site for any government (NSA) to use, facebook to sell, or hacker to hack. Why leave something like that up if you don't use it?
@_date: 2013-06-18 14:44:53
Why do these threads always come to attacks of the poster's competence? I made the account while driving to the place where I would be sending the money. The market was at a delicate time and every second was money so I made the account on my phone. I used a simple and easy to remember password (at the time). That same password, which I'm sure I didn't misremember, no longer works. I probably got hacked but I want my account back at the very least to confirm this for myself. 
As for my email, I used hidemyass.com. Because anonymity is important to me I didn't use a backup email because the only one I had available to me was my professional email and that would completely defeat the point at that time where time was of the essence.
I know I brought this on myself and I blame no one but myself. I'm not even that worried about the bitcoins. They can be stolen for all I care. The point is localbitcoins isn't returning my emails. Their IT guy could have stolen them after I told them I lost access to my account for all I know. With no correspondence I'm simply left speculating about the trustworthiness of the site I used.
So I came here hoping maybe localbitcoin lurks on reddit (which they should!) or someone with access can provide my with an understanding of my situation. :/
Sidenote: Bitcoin's worst enemy right now isn't governments but the pisspoor exchanges we have to work with. Seriously I'm trying to buy bitcoins today and bitinstant is down because of "problems with one of our partners" and I'm waiting on a seller on localbitcoins to message me back with what name to put on his money order so I can go through with a ridiculous 6% transfer fee (S/N FUCK Western Union). 
Sorry for the ramble. I have a lot on my mind and no one to talk to.

The market was at like 71 something and it just went up and up in a matter of 10 seconds all the way to 77 dollars a bitcoin. I can only assume it was a small amount of peoples but it was very interesting to watch. It's always pleasurable or daunting to see a candlestick grow upward or downward in realtime.

Yeah, I paid a premium. I sent another support email and got a response. Basically they said (politely), there's nothing we can do about it. Get access to your email and put in a lost password request. I'm satisfied with that response. I just wanted a response. I'm gonna hack into my email. I know what letters and numbers I used at least.

I have always been under the impression that an encrypted wallet on an OS used for anything other than that encrypted wallet isn't very safe at all. Not really. Using the same computer you browse random websites and porn with as you keep your wallet is like shitting where you eat.

If you spent it immediately after buying you didn't lose out on any gains, you just spent money that, in retrospect, you are wishing you had invested. That's not nearly as painful.

Neither of us knows the other but we are each making judgements on each other based on, what? A username? A misogynistic quote? We each think we can see each other's heart of hearts by a couple lines on a computer screen. We're both wrong. It would be funny and ironic is it weren't so SAD. I hope you're not lonely. And I hope you realize how hurtful it is to equate wearing skirts to something negative. Skirts are awesome. Skirts are great. Especially in the summer. All day breeziness. Fuck yeah.
Have a good day. I may not like you but I'll never see you on the street so have a good day.
Also, don't say shit like "If you only knew the truth." Share it. I like truth and I won't judge. If I'm the only one who you can tell the truth... Tell it. Did this just get weird? Fuck it.

Dude, don't tell me to put pants on. I'm not some unprofessional cheap bastard trying to circumvent conventions. I'm a delivery driver who wants to not spend half his tips every week just getting to a place where I can convert it. That's an unreasonable expectation in my current fiscal context. It's about context. Also I'm not giving someone money for nothing. 
If they made the decision to make to sell their bitcoins, their overhead is their burden. I don't pay tithes and I don't attend church. I don't tip (right now) so I don't buy pizza. Get it? God you were such a fucking jerk 12 minutes ago.
