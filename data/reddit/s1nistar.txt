"In your life."
So you wouldn't pay to have Trump killed?
Kim Jong Un?
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan?
Let's go simpler though... how about the convicted child rapist who's hiding his past in your neighborhood? How about the person who murdered/raped one of your friend's family members but was never caught or identified? or some other such situation. There are pieces of garbage disguised as humans everywhere. Always has been.
You might not be AWARE of it, miss. But everyone wants someone's existence removed from this world. It's human nature.

As if you would never pay to have someone killed. 
Everyone has had at least one person they want dead.

Where did I say I was hoping for anything?
I'm illustrating a point. Armchair morality and condescension is easy when it's not affecting you. Altruism is self-deception.

Truth is ugly, isn't it?

What way? Realistically? 
People are complex beings full of flaws and virtues. Not everything is sunshine and rainbows. Many people are just **so flawed** that they are huge threats to others, safety and society and have committed atrocities severe enough that they need to be permanently removed for everyone's good. This is why prisons exist. This is why the death penalty exists.
Crying about it and saying "that's horrible" doesn't change the truth.

Walk in on your daughter or son being beaten and raped then talk about how "mature" it is to not want someone dead.
