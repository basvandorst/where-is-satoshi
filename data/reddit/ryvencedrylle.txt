Fine, but a reminder that censorship means the government telling you what you can or can not say, not another entity. People aren't allowed to speak without consequences, as you have aptly demonstrated here with me. The whole "your freedom to swing your fist ends when it reaches my face" thing.

I have to point out the irony here of libertarian "eff the banks!" Bitcoin wanting big money investors. &lt;side eye&gt; I completely understand the reasoning, but still. It's a little weird.
That being said, Bitcoin and Dogecoin going at each other is like the hand and the kidney arguing that the other is a waste of the body's energy. Dogecoin is an economic mess, but you can't discount its lowered barrier to entry. If you want mass acceptance there's something to be said for the crypto that's full of teenagers and folks who know neither hide nor hair about cryptography (I am in the latter group but not the former). I mean, cripe, Dogecoin turned Twitter into fricking Western Union!
Does Dogecoin need a miracle to make it through the last halvings? Absolutely. I think any shibe with half a brain knows things could go seriously wrong by the end of the year. If Dogecoin bites it and Bitcoin or Litecoin or whoever doesn't move in to take advantage of the grassroots infrastructure Dogecoin has built so far (the Twitter tipbot, the enthusiastic base of young people, savethemhood's San Francisco philanthropy, even this NASCAR craziness), I'd have to wonder just how different crypto really intends to be from the centralized banking system it claims to want to leave behind.

I think a comparison between the religious community and the Native American community in terms of historical treatment and current position in society is hardly a fair comparison, but that's not really the point. No, not everyone will make that comparison. Heck, some people in the groups I mentioned won't even make that comparison. No small number will, though, and if you want to use debt-slave to really hit home the magnitude of the problem that might be a way to do it. Kind of a shock thing. The problem is I see the term used in ways that appear to be callous or offhand far too often. This is the Internet. Anyone could be seeing what you write. Represent crypto well. That's what I'm asking.

There's a very good case for slavery as a proper analogy when you start talking about police brutality, the prison industry, institutionalized poverty, etc. That's why I said "think" not "don't do it." There are cases where it's very apt. My point is if you're just upset about income tax and inflation (which a re valid things to be upset about), the slavery metaphor can be more damaging to the cause than helpful.

I'll be there representing Prypto as a reseller. Hope to have some card samples with me as well.

People are people. Thanks for the reply!

Honest answer, probably somewhere around 6 but maybe earlier. There is admittedly (and annoyingly) no good hard and fast line on how to call the transition but I think by 6 you're safely out of range. Interestingly, that makes 3, which could easily be a parent/child relationship also a slave relationship. That's a pretty bold statement.
