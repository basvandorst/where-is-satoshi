Got it
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:58:27
This is me... but I hodl and will buy more as soon as funds clear... we’re not all scared!
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:07:25
Yes , shortly.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:56:48
but it started to rise to 1k,3k,5k etc... before that episode aired last week.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:16:39
Thanks bud. Probably be in the next few weeks. I just started so I don’t have much coin 
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:20:08
Don’t think u read the page linked at al
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:56:42
I think buy
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:06:12
Agree! We need to discuss higher level topics, effect of but coin globally, new merchants that accept, new project ( lightning). This has become an investing sub and not a sub about but coin ( which makes me nervous )
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:48:23
It’s not in your hands you spent it. Banks just take a long time ( see why we love bitcoin)
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:19:19
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:28:23
Also! What about fees ( coin base) my fee might be 99 cents on a 5 dollar transaction..... how does that come into play?
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:56:57
You say wallets, do u mean wallets or exchanges?
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:00:53
yes you can reset it.......but.....most people dont.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:42:27
It’s where I just started , so I have all my verification in order already. Do you have recommendations for a different one ?
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:25:42
Cool, but it’s still manual correct? Each transaction should be logged 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:43:45
Yah lol ...
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:04:04
Interesting, what is salt? Looks like they lend cash with crypto as collateral?
What’s involved in a membership? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:28:23
i havent used them at all...I am strictly holding until 2020 regardless of what happens....I just would like to try and buy some when/if there is a dip on this current run, in addition to the amount I buy each day regardless of price ( dollar cost average). Instead of sitting in front of my computer all day everyday watching I'd like to just set it. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:56:00
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:57:51
Yah I hear yah, slow and steady wins the race. I haven’t out in a fraction of what I want to invest... got to do it as paychecks come in.... but I do like to see gains :)
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:21:27
It’s old school 
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:45:53
Ok, any good reads on fundamentals?
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:23:15
please explain further?
Cant i create a wallet and then send my bitcoin to that?
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:34:44
Log In To GDAX with your coinbase credentials.
Get you deposit wallet info
Send coins to GDAX from Coinbase (Instant/Free)
Send Coins from GDAX to electrum (Very cheap)
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:51:41
ya, I just wish I had more to invest!
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:27:14
I went through this 3-4 years ago....ended up making a paper wallet...however...i lost it and the 1 BTC that was on it :(
I don't have access to any computers that I am sure are virus/malware free. What do you reccomend?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:50:15
What is the advantage of a hardware wallet VS a paper wallet. It seems that for some reason you need to attach your hardware wallet to PC every time you want to deposit new bit coins....but paper wallets you dont? you just send to the wallet address? why?
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:49:59
That makes sense. I would like to dabble in both, more in the long term for obvious reasons... but some play money in more active day trading could be fun.... maybe pay for a new MacBook here and there lol..... or of course lose it... which again I understand the risks of.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:04:44
Is there a delay between gdax and wallet?, and vice versa 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:03:30
The long HODL!
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:55:50
I know :(
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:53:28
Yah, that’s what I said above
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:47:20
interesting...how long does it usually take for at least the 0/6 confirmation page to show up on block cypher
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:44:43
Can someone explain what I’m looking at though please in the btc table... is up good or bad ?
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:35:06
Can u explain what I’m looking in the table ?
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:24:57
I understand that, which is why I  will be purchasing any new coins/selling through GDAX. I guesse I'm curious if it's okay to move my coins for Coinbase System Into the GDAX system and leave them there. vs leaving them in Coinbase.
Or what the 3rd better option might be?
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:41:39
word....lost my paper wallet a few years ago :(
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:44:07
What about with gdax ? Are fees built into that platform as well?
When are fees not built in? Via peer to peer ? Or....
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:01:00
This is the kind of shit that makes me nervous
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:27:04
No begging 
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:19:19
I keep ready about changing fees.... I assume these are the fees for the miners.... does this come into play at all if I’m using Coinbase or gdax?
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:17:57
Having issues here
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:01:25
Ok, you HAVE a job. Things can ALWAYS be better man. Bitcoin isn’t going to change anything. I have “ some” money. Dropped like a few hundred bucks in over the last week before it went all crazy... I’m still only at 100 bucks profit..... this won’t change your life now.... maybe in 19 years I’ll have like 40k which is nothing.
Try and be optimistic, lots of people with millions live depressing lives and kill themselves... money is not the answer, being content with the good things in life you do have. Steady job, roof, food, general health, friends, family, access to clean water.
There are literally people in this world during because they have no food... think about that, you drive to the 711 and grab a hot dog , don’t think twice. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:56:49
And you choose which option
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:45:51
nice! Wish you luck!
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:55:11
concensous seems to be hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:55:32
Try and be happy BECAUSE of that fact. How much worse would you feel with a hungry belly, living with flys all around you in some god forsaken war torn country. Count your blessings.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:25:19
That’s investing /gambling. We are in uncharted territory, anything could happen. Why be such a downer?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:32:42
I got banned for a comment like this be careful
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:23:19
Would love an answerZ I’m considering getting the Nano 7
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:47:51
Hello, new here too! Welcome it looks like fun but please remember you money could double tomo and be gone the next.
Please only invest what you are absolutely ok will completely losing. If you are looking for other options that are safer but better uses of money that “just sits “ in your bank account I would recommend the following in order of liquidity ( how easy you can get your money out)
High yield savings - ally bank , this is a little over 1 percent interest 
Maturing cd account - your”lock “ your money into these with your bank but they have a higher interest rate that all checking accounts and MOST savings accounts... better rates the longer you agree to not touch your money.
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:34:17
you have a great perspective! however MTGOX :(
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:38:48
Thank you for the info. What about IOS wallets, where on the spectrum to they lie? is it a good comprimise between GDAX and Hardware wallet. Right now the amounts are so insignificant that a hardware wallet does not make sense from a cost perspecitve...but I still want to be safe :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:38:30
It is dangerous, purely speculative.
The hope is that once enough people get in, learn, and actually have wallets/coin.... adoption to the next step ie goods and services will be easier.
That being said, I just started last week ( up 40 percent woooo) it feels like gambling. I don’t believe it is viable as currency yet. To many hoops to jump through to get it,  not enough places to spend it, and the price fluctuations make it impossible to know if I’m buy a 10 dollar pizza that will be a 200 dollar pizza tomorrow.
I also don’t like that I’m never “ sure” that I’m doing things right... spending money should be easy, I shouldn’t need to worry that my coin “made it” to the other side or in my wallet properly. 
I am a credit card user, swipe and done. Send me the bill, I’ll earn some points/mikes and pay it off no problem. With bitcoin there is no credit system... u can only spend what you have on hand at that moment which I don’t think is very practical.... 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:56:22
Good man!
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:09:03
I had an alert set... and I never sent me notification.
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:36:07
Sorry, thank u
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:17:33
I understand this aspect. I’m trying to understand when I would be in a position to “set a few”
Say I have my coin in a hardware wallet and want to quickly send to Coinbase to sell... do I need to set a fee? How much? What’s standard lol ..
It feels like tipping at a restersunt 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:48:45
same. I just got in, and for very meager amounts each month that I can afford So i'll settle for a nice car or college fund for the kids.
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:38:18
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:27:37
Question. I made a paper wallet once and had 1 bitcoin in it. BUT my stupidness lost the price of paper. 
I now have a safe so I am more confident I wouldn’t loose it, however the idea of a hardware wallet  seems more elegant.
Here is my question, what happens if the hardware wallet fails. Electronics break all the time... what is the safe guard ?
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:50:40
All true but he is talking about taking cash from Coinbase and deposit into his bank
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:20:50
Just weird that one went through from the 27th and it’s been more than a few days and the one from 28th has not
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:26:50
can you explain the other options to me? 
Its still very confusing. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:04:41
I can see the international aspect but again the barriers to entry is a hurdle... and what happens if your 5k paycheck is 4K by the time it gets to you..............
No I don’t remember that as I’m too you, however the difference between writing a letter and putting it in the mail vs email is a flawed argument. Email is inherently better and offers a ton of advantages, no postage, no getting lost in the mail, instant,  for ANYONE looking at the situation whether they at 10 or 90. If you knew how to write and address a letter you could address and write an email.
The same can’t be said for bitcoin, if you have use cash, or a credit card.... it doesn’t mean you know how to use bitcoin. The “shift” isn’t as fluid.
Trust me I am ALL about ease of use, I love things line Venmo/Apple Pay/ etc... but even with Apple Pay BUILT IN to the most popular object in the world... something the majority of people have with them 100 percent of the time.... many people don’t use it... and MANY merchants don’t accept it. It’s frustrating.
I’m still investing, and plan to hold on for a WHILE. I am just one perspective, skeeed toward the everyday man use case. I am SURE there are much smarter people out there than I am and will many more relevant use cases.... I don’t claim to know EVERYTHING. There is obviously SOMETHING to this, which is why I am investing in its future regardless of my personal thoughts.... as it progresses it will one day “click” for me.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:30:50
hmm. guesse im still confused.:(
if I have a STOP-Buy at 10000 and and Limit Buy at 10000 what would be the difference?
Also is there a way to set a certain usd dollar amount....and a BTC price...and just get me as many BTC as my USD will fill? SO i don't need to do the math?
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:26:43
Also you have to put in the bitcoin amount not the amount you invested and the price.
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:38:14

I hav, regarding ledgers already set up with pins and 24 works recover phrases then resealed. 
Take a look st @_date: 2017-12-07 05:23:25
Planning on getting a nano soon. Can you explain how you test your seen ( step by step please)
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:24:54
How do u reset? Is it a button combination ? Menu to navigate to, or through the ledger Chrome app
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:42:31
I read that if you transfer to gdax (instant) and withdraw there is no fee.
@_date: 2019-05-10 21:42:10
Ok cool
@_date: 2019-05-10 20:55:22
Is GDAX no longer good?
What’s a good option to get coins off them?
@_date: 2013-07-15 17:03:26
with the two factor authentication yes i think so, becasue when I set it up I had to set it up within my user account. I re set it up in the google app one my new iphone for the same e-mail address as my bitfloor login, but it says authentication token ivalid...i dont know what to do.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:06:51
i have one more question..maybe you can help..
I kind of under stand paper wallets....ofline it generates a private key ( SECRET!) and a public address...right?
so I can just send coins to the address it creates......and there stored? 
How does one get them off the paper address and back into an exchange? send them first to a software client? then to the exchange?....can I sent a small portion of a paper wallet to the exchange? if i want to transfer from the exchange back to the paper wallet i just use the same address/secret key? or does a new paper wallet need to be created?
@_date: 2013-07-15 19:39:27
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:00:29
and in regards to mtgox vs a wallet....are they the same?
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:10:40
what about that process could potentially make me lose coins due to a change address?
@_date: 2013-07-15 17:12:11
yah i doubt it this roman guy wont respond to ANY communication so fucked up!
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:52:20
fastest way i figured out was bitfloor...deposit into a bofa accont
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:22:44
100 milibit = 100 mBTC correct?
so on mt gox just make a purchase for .1 btc?
@_date: 2013-07-15 19:23:56
see i set up google authenitcator on my new device, with the same e-mail as bitfloor. but it doest let me login.
dont i need some special information from within bitfloor? like that qr code or somehting/
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:57:23
but once you import a private key of a paper wallet, arent you supposed to dispose of that wallet ANYWAY? and create a new one?
also, is it safe to turn off the change address creation?
if the paper wallet is empty and electrum created a change address...how would i " Lose the coins"
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:08:06
im reading up as quickly as possible, i thinik I may have missed this boat however.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:34:43
how would you buy an mBTC? Is that possible?
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:16:33
so let me get this strait....if I have 1 paper file with 10 bit coins in, send 5 to my electrum address....the remainging 5 are no longer in the paper address?
also is this the same for recieve coins? I have 5 btc in my electrum wallet and someone sends me 5... does the 1 address get 10 or is it split up?
@_date: 2013-07-29 19:01:38
Is the private key something i would find INSIDE of my bit floor account?
I have only gottan as far as downlaoding the Ios APP, and setting it up inside of GOOGLE.
If i need something from bitfloor then again, im locked out and can't get to it.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:49:59
is the bofa deposit legit?
