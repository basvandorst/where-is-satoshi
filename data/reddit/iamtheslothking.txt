@_date: 2017-12-01 21:43:07
Same as 2013, people realize its all speculation and no one believes its actually a viable technology for currency, people panic and jump ship.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:18:04
And that would only happen if there was a low traffic day, which isnt likely right now

@_date: 2017-01-12 17:51:05


@_date: 2017-01-12 20:50:05
It's due to the massive inflation Bitcoin saw over the last month, it was going to drop again eventually.

@_date: 2018-06-28 19:13:00
Not only do they have fees, the fees get higher when more people make transactions
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:27:44
It starts out as just a random blip of more people buying, which increases the price, which starts then bitcoin price news cycle, who causes people to get interested in bitcoin again, which propels feedback loop

Im not saying a hardware wallet might not be the safest method, but its the margin of safety from an 80+ dollar device(just looking at amazon) that hasnt convinced me. I would need to be on an infected pc with an extremely specific type of malware that is somehow able to read 12 words that were on my screen one time.
I would think the easier method if the sliver of extra safety was really necessary would be to run a fresh linux install offline and create a wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:24:05

@_date: 2017-11-27 18:04:48
You are probably correct that coinbase is most likely safer given the chance you can fuck something up along the way. But your coinbase account can be extremely secure, it requires a password, an email verification on any new pc or your pc after 30 days, and an optional RSA token from your phone or even more secure through a specially designed RSA app. Creating a second coinbase account is probably not worth it and may actually get your account locked for some kind of breach of their ToS when you verify your identity. And If you are moving your coins around anyways, you might as well move them to a wallet. Coinbase also features a vault that makes moving your coins even more difficult to deter theft.
Its more likely that coinbase shutdown or receive some form of cease and desist from the government than your account getting stolen, but that is also extremely unlikely. 
For complete piece of mind, look into a hardware wallet.

If you don’t believe in a deflationary currency, then theres no real reason for you to like bitcoin right?
Im curious why you think its overvalued right now, and did you also think it was overvalued in 2013 at 1k? I firmly believe bitcoin is gonna take a nosedive in january, but as for where it lands and where it goes up from there, i have no idea. Bitcoins worth started at 0 dollars, so how did you convince yourself what its real worth is? Theres x many people who want it and only x amount in the market.
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:02:25
You are comparing the prices between two different exchanges, How are you determining which is more valid? On the flip side of the coin, you could have sold your coins on coinbase and VOILA, you are getting more money than if you sold on the other exchange at the same time.
Coinbase didnt decide the current price, Users on their exchange GDAX did.

You are asking a bitcoin forum if you should buy bitcoin. What do you think the litecoin forum would say? Or a stock investing forum?
You are young, so if you dont need the money immediately now, your age is the time to make large risk investments. Lets say you go all in with that hunk of cash into bitcoin right now, what are you going to do if bitcoin was in a bubble and sinks back down to 5k? Will you panic and sell to try to get some of your money back? Will you kick yourself when it goes back up to some new ATH and try to buy back in again?
Those are the mistakes that younger people tend to make, they worry about the short term price when they really need to just lock their coins away for a few years and not think about it.

Juat give it time
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:07:05
This creates a problem for customers trying to purchase games with Bitcoin. When checking out on Steam, a customer will transfer x amount of Bitcoin for the cost of the game, plus y amount of Bitcoin to cover the transaction fee charged by the Bitcoin network. The value of Bitcoin is only guaranteed for a certain period of time so if the transaction doesn’t complete within that window of time, then the amount of Bitcoin needed to cover the transaction can change. The amount it can change has been increasing recently to a point where it can be significantly different.
The normal resolution for this is to either refund the original payment to the user, or ask the user to transfer additional funds to cover the remaining balance. In both these cases, the user is hit with the Bitcoin network transaction fee again. This year, we’ve seen increasing number of customers get into this state. With the transaction fee being so high right now, it is not feasible to refund or ask the customer to transfer the missing balance (which itself runs the risk of underpayment again, depending on how much the value of Bitcoin changes while the Bitcoin network processes the additional transfer).

You can buy it whenever if you think it's going to continue going up. But my 2 cents is to look at the history of crypto and realize that this is probably going to be another huge bubble created by hype. Bitcoin is going to continue to have huge swells like this. Like another guy said, the worst time to buy is when everyone is wanting to buy
