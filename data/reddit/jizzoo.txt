The dude broke the law, he knew about it, ... what's with all the crying over his fate? He deserved way more then what he got. He should be happy with 2yrs ffs. All this talk of some kind of "martyrdom" is so infantile and immature. OP please grow the fuck up ok? You are making the rest of BTC community (most law abiding citizens) look like complete idiots.

thank you so much for your help guys! 
I'm terribly sorry for thinking of you less :-)

Jesse: frankly didn't expect quick response thank you for that!
I haven't received a ticket # (I got no response after filing support ticket on the site or emailing support But my migrated Cavirtex username is c0d34w4y53, email: vlad.bogdanov The problem I'm having is I'm not able to recall the password I had last used with Cavirtex. I have the original Cavirtex secretkey and the one-time password issued by Kraken for the c0d34w4y53 account only.  I guess if there's a way I could reset my old password then I'm back in the game. 
I had a prior account with Kraken also and maybe that's causing the conflict. Prior to merger, I had $300 in Cavirtex account. Small change by most accounts but for a guy on disability it's still some change :)
Either way, many thanks for getting back at me, I wasn't sure what was going on tbh.

hope you are not trying to sell that lakefront property to buy up more BTC.. as that would be seriously fucked up
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:20:28
"sour grapes"? What retard are you? BTC was the worst performing currency / commodity / investment (whatever you call it) of last year. One aught to be blind not to spot it. I was lucky to get out with some profit.. but despite of it, I would not advise my friends to invest in BTC at this time.  
Oh and your strawman argument is utter bullshit claiming people are sour because they wish they had the money to buy up more BTC for themselves. I have more than plenty of money to buy up a ton of BTC but I wouldn't do it and wouldn't advise anybody to do it either, for very obvious reasons of which you are obviously blatantly ignorant about.

Hey Jesse, how about you go down to wherever the fuck your support team sits and kick their ass to pay attention to their clients? 
You have migrated my Cavirtex account over to your site and for a month now I've not been able to get on and access my funds despite pleading with your support to help me. 
Do you know how much correspondence I got back from Kraken to all my support requests? ZERO. 
tl&amp;dr: be cautious doing business with Kraken, their support is NON-EXISTENT!

Not sure this is going to work out for you.. I've just sold bunch and hope to pick up few at $80.. 
@_date: 2015-07-04 07:45:20
right, I lol'ed

Just loaded up on appl
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:47:12
exactly. The boat has sailed on BTC. The PoW mining scheme has proven its Achilles heel. There are vastly better and more robust blockchain techs coming online that will work long term. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:35:18
good luck with that logic
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:10:53
Serious question: what's the highest price they bought their bitcoin at? 
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:00:46
How much btc do you guys hodl? 
@_date: 2018-12-06 18:15:00
what the fuck is that? I spent 10 minutes and saw exactly 0 analysis other than "BITCOIN HODL! Other alts = shit!"
@_date: 2018-12-08 20:46:09
Honestly the most insightful comment I've read on this subreddit in some time. Thank you. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 16:13:39
how's everything bad about economy auto good for bitcoin? Confirmation bias much? How about Ethereum? Other cryptos. Amazon's entry into the blockchain play pan will wreck others. Just watch. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:12:21
Ok, that I do agree on. The blockchain is definitely a promising tech notwithstanding all the mania over specific coins (looking at BTC)
