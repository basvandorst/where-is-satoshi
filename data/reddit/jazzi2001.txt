Cancelled transactions....count as transactions that went throguh. You have to remove them from the csv file yourself. Look for identical amounts purchased one after the other.

Second dump?

Corrections and dips happen every 12-17 days with bitcoin. The thing is when someone buys at an ATH the first time and bitcoin starts falling your initial instinct will be to sell. Irregardless of everyone saying HODL. When you see your investment start to fall I would say 75% of people have weak hands and will sell. However after that first correction is over and the price rebounds then those same weak hands become HODLers 
Everyone needs to go through there first correction process.

So technically since the severity of that dip only happened or was over with after 1 day. If tonight and tomorrow morning we get another dip similar to last night/this morning that would mean it's not a replica. Thus making this crash or dip a singular event. Making all posts comparing to past dips this year false?

I must admit that's an excellent answer. 
You know your stuff.

Go back to r/btc
But in all seriousness that was most likely the fee. Not sure why your buying $40 of bitcoin and then sending to another exchange.

Maybe he meant takes 157 billion to  raise it to 40k which would make a lot more sense....

Long time bitcoin supporter... Bought some bitcoin cash to test it out. Absolutely fees are less but wait time is still anywhere between 15-25mins....unlike litecoin Whixh has never taken more than 3mins for any of my transactions. 
Litecoin is highly undervalued.
