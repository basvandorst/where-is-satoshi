Can I claim that I somehow bought BTC with fiat on Binance at latest price?

Oh of course, a XMR wallet is necessary.

I still think if you don’t do some confusing BTC transfers a lot of times by yourself, IRS is able to know which address are yours without Binance trading history. So I recomment to use XMR.

Thanks, I didn’t know this before. Interesting!

From what I know, IRS now has the ability to trace and identify BTC transactions. If the transactions are BTC at Coinbase -&gt; BTC at Binance -&gt; BTC at Coinbase, then IRS knows they are the same BTC belonging to you. So XMR are necessary.

My point is, I don’t want to link them as “the same” BTC. When I sell, I transfer the BTC from Binance, and I claim this is some BTC I bought abroad with fiat at latest price. The. sell it on Coinbase immediately at latest price.

In my steps, the “initial” BTC is the BTC transferred from Binance. After all, only Coinbase  and US exchanges provide data to IRS, and this is the only thing Coinbase sees.

The idea is how to pay as less tax as possible. Here are the steps:
1. Buy BTC on Coinbase (or any other US exchange).
2. Immediately transfer the BTC you bought to Binance (or any other exchange outside of IRS’s eyes). The transfer should be considered a taxable behavior, and the profit you make here (which is approximately zero because the price won’t change much during the short time) is taxable.
3. Use all your BTC to buy XMR (or ZEC, the point is, they are completely not possible to be tracked by IRS) on Binance. **Edit:** Withdral your XMR to your own wallet. After this step, nobody but yourself knows how much crypto you have.
4. Use XMR (or ZEC) to buy other crypto you like, such as BTC on Binance. HODL as long as you want.
5. When you want to sell your crypto, buy XMR first, and then use XMR to buy BTC, and finally transfer your BTC to Coinbase and then sell it to USD immediately. The last part on Coinbase is also taxable, but the taxable profit is almost zero because of the short time.
How does this sound?
