At Coinbase, we have recently changed our ToS to say that under 18 can use Coinbase with parental consent:
"To be eligible to use the Coinbase Services, you must be at least 18 years old (or the applicable age of majority and contractual capacity). By accessing or using the Coinbase Services you represent and warrant that you are 18 or older. You may also be eligible to use the Coinbase Services if you are at least 13 years old, but only if your parents provide express written consent. Parental consent for use of the Coinbase Services by an individual who is at least 13 years old must be forwarded to support
Hope that helps.

The best way to see if there is a general outage in any Coinbase service would be to check 
The error you received may be a transient error, but we log those and review them. If at any time this persists, contact Coinbase support at support and we'll look into it in detail.

I can confirm that in fact that's the case, that is:
- If you send someone bitcoin via email AND
- They don't have an account in Coinbase (i.e. they create the account through your email)
That should be counted as a referral (if all other conditions are met). 
Do not hesitate to contact Coinbase Support if you have any issues.

Hi there, this was finally solved and now you should be able to enter your private key during the process of creating the multisig vault. 
We replied in the community post but I will put it here for the benefit of Reddit users.
