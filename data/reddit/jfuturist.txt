lol time to short.
@_date: 2018-09-08 21:00:12
If you have a problem with this, you're an anti-semite.
@_date: 2018-09-28 11:22:19
lol why because it happened last year?  Nah.
@_date: 2018-09-11 20:36:31
Oh, its not that hard to trace it back to coinbase or whatever KYC fiat on ramp you used to get your coin.
@_date: 2018-09-11 20:16:24
Public.  Ledger.  You know all those absolute nightmare 1984 scenarios of absolute and total surveillance and control?  BTC is perfect for that.  In fact, it would be required.  
If you're a Bitcoin maximalist I must assume you're good with the world watching you buy that dragon dildo and anal lube.  Or that kilo.  Or manpad.  
@_date: 2018-09-21 19:08:44
lol its 5% you desperate fucks
@_date: 2019-11-21 23:52:54
Opt out of what exactly?  Centralized monetary control?  Surveillance?
Bitmain. . .
public ledger. . .
@_date: 2019-11-12 19:06:47
If you think that will be allowed just ...lol
@_date: 2019-11-26 13:34:55
Ok but if you can’t handle it dropping below $2000 for a couple years you should get out now.
@_date: 2019-11-07 13:06:14
Bitcoin enables the most oppressive and surveillance heavy system imaginable. It is a surveillance system.  If you’re all about freedom and privacy and you’re pimping BTC you’re doing it wrong. Monero is the coin you’re looking for.
@_date: 2019-11-26 03:45:09
And it will be ended violently.
@_date: 2019-11-07 18:49:14
Public.  Ledger.
Lightning does not change this.
@_date: 2019-11-29 02:32:16
Only nazis care about privacy because the only thing you’d need to hide about yourself for fear of repercussions is your bigoted thoughts. Just don’t be a fascist piece of shit and you don’t need privacy. I mean wtf else is so damn sensitive that you can’t broadcast it. Go on I’ll wait.
@_date: 2019-11-21 22:56:32
Every cent over $400 is artificial retardation and you know it.
@_date: 2019-11-07 13:00:33
\&gt;pls pump my bags back to $19k
Dude just eat it. It’s gone.
@_date: 2019-11-17 23:14:21
Bitcoin is a surveillance system.
@_date: 2018-10-31 21:03:49
lol no he won’t and neither will any of you in 6 months. 
@_date: 2019-11-30 02:39:44
@_date: 2019-11-21 23:42:21
This poor bastard. . .
@_date: 2019-11-29 02:21:54
Nah. Sub $2000 incoming.
@_date: 2018-10-26 10:33:00
Tumblr is gonna go nuclear. Something something gender equality...
@_date: 2019-11-28 22:07:42
Total centralization and surveillance. Sounds like a government to me.
@_date: 2018-10-26 10:31:00
Fuck off Roger. 
@_date: 2019-11-21 23:50:37
So BTC is in no way decentralized at all.  Got it.  Aaaand its a surveillance system essentially.  Cool.
@_date: 2018-06-15 11:25:37
Nah I'm pretty sure buying more crypto would be far worse than bitching on the internet.  The rest of the world agrees as evidenced by this crash.  And I'm pretty sure the price going down isn't due to complaining but probably has more to do with the fact that this thing is going nowhere.  
@_date: 2018-06-15 12:16:00
Yeah, I’m going to take a much safer bet than McAfee and wager that if BTC ever reaches 16k again I’ll eat MY own dick. Keep cope-holding though. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 22:10:44
Eat a god damn dick.  I’ve lost thousands of dollars and I’ll be pissed as I fucking want. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 10:31:42
Time to try and forget my losses again after you reminded me?
@_date: 2018-06-16 21:38:50
They only ban nazis. And before you open your enabling fucking mouth about “freeze peach” just stfu. 
@_date: 2019-10-29 15:49:31
So they'd rather take 2 hours and a $20 fee to buy a pack of gum?
@_date: 2018-06-15 12:22:48
You can’t “short” crypto like a proper stock. Selling and buying back in is just flushing money. Is this ...ah, it is your first day here. 
@_date: 2019-12-06 15:40:53
Yeah I don’t know what you’re waiting for though.
@_date: 2019-04-03 14:04:16
Yeah, if you're up at all.  I mean at all.  Sell.  Its bout to shit.
@_date: 2018-11-01 11:21:33
Many won't.  No one is actually about the tech and what its social/political implications are as evidenced by everyone here begging Goldman fucking Sachs to buy their bags.  There will be no bull run this year, that will cause a free fall, selloff, most will get out.  News will dry up.  Done. It'll just be this obscure thing you buy drugs on the internet with. 
@_date: 2019-01-20 03:36:06
You spelled Monero wrong.
@_date: 2018-11-13 20:10:09
Guess you all have to go on a crusade to destroy crypto now.  Normal white people are using it.  The horror. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 13:13:17
Yeah, but this is the end, its all ogre etc etc. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 20:14:06
Anything over a few dollars is over valued.  Don't buy.  I'm trying to help you.
@_date: 2018-07-01 14:22:38
See you at globally illegal.  
@_date: 2018-07-19 11:32:31
Yeah whats the ATH again?  Right.
@_date: 2018-07-11 16:50:28
more like $60
@_date: 2018-04-25 20:54:24
Not saying I'm a fan of this Ver person but help me out here.  How does a software project continue development without leadership?  Even open source projects have an individual or team that guides its future development and decides what code makes the cut etc.  
Communes and anarchy don't work.  Not even on paper, and certainly not in computer code. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 11:58:45
lol no.  
@_date: 2018-12-19 13:40:24
This is sad and you should feel bad.
