Almost invest with them after I saw the 2 years promo. The article from Bitcoin Magazine did stop me, will see how they progress in the future.

Tipping makes people excited, I know many redditors tip in Dogecoin community but I'm glad there are still people tipping in Bitcoin community. My hat's off to you both - [and [@_date: 2014-02-09 00:20:16
I don't think it's a good time to sell. It's a good time to buy more at the moment.

mtgox should be dead by now, invest on the other stable market, don't ever waste your dollar in mtgox, ever.

Probably a trading site moving BTC, that's a lot of BTC btw.
@_date: 2014-11-03 02:08:57
Thanks [I was totally drowned into it last time, but a little off after mtgox gone, slowing down with dogecoin and now totally none with digital currency. Maybe will be back once Reddit coin official.

Try Bitcoin Marketplace - [r/BitMarket](

[slur.io]( dejavu.

Not to mention people tipping to a different wallet for each user - Reddit bitcoin wallet, changetip etc. It's distributed to a lot of different wallet, which maybe they'll forget it after a while.

I'm using Electrum as my main wallet and blockchain to monitor the address. The double spends warning pop-up today several times, first time I saw it pop-up. Now it's gone.
Must be blockchain site problem.

Lol, I feel bad anyone who invest a lot on Hashie.co
I just play around the 10ghs free from Hashie.co, who knows it'll live another 30 years.

Nice physical design by tgbex. Loaded with BTC is the dangerous part.

No easy way to get 0.1 BTC. You need to sell something. Try [and good luck.

I'm interested, thanks!

It depends on the 'moderate' amount you're talking about.
As for me, should avoid any online wallet, we will never know.
I'm pretty much think that Ledger USB and Trezor are some of early prototypes example for a hardware wallet. Just like I'm using a pendrive with Electrum inside.
You can checkout Case too, upcoming hardware wallet - [

Hi, pretty great site, like others said - You need to do some polishing, make it like a pro.
1. Should be great if you can make full advantage of the wide browser. Bigger boxes perhaps. Like viewing photos Flickr style, if that's a photo site - [
2. When buying items, would be great if a popup for confirmation appeared. Maybe as a buyer want to click buy on a $10K photo, he/she have to rethink again.
3. A bidding site, great if I know someone outbid me. Where they outbid, a drop down notifications with the link directly. Make me easier to follow up the items, directly.
4. Items list that I follow/bid, and a watchlist/favorite perhaps.
Overall, it's great site so far. I like playing the bid increment, but I don't know if someone out bid me. Simply because I browse on other items while leave the bidding on.

Wrong place to post. Try [@_date: 2015-01-24 01:50:09
Why people keep trying to create ID for a person from the Blockchain, this and Bitnation. Afaik people love to use Bitcoin because of the anonymous feature, at least from average user.
People even want a fancy Bitcoin vanity address.
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:14:37
It depends on what wallet you use. With Bitcoin QT, you just need to backup a single file regularly - wallet.dat. Electrum wallet on the other hand, just remember a 12 words. You can popup the wallet anywhere with the 12 words.
@_date: 2015-01-23 13:17:19
No problem :) Gladly to help you out, feel free to buzz me again anytime. Thanks for the BTC.

Gaw, Paycoin and Hashtalk should fall together. I'm glad they're falling apart now before they even get bigger.
It's going downfall, mtgox dejavu now.

Lol, good one.

Man, that's big but I still think $200 is not the bottom price yet. Expecting $100-150 soon and will hovering at that price for a while.
@_date: 2015-01-03 05:12:32
Hopefully the XPY or Paycoin price fall below $0.01, we can rofl after that then :))

Almost buy some XPY or Paycoin, now I'm not even care about it after more reading about the scam.

Bitnation perhaps.

.23 BTC, better hold, do not trade it on the market. If you have more BTC, you can risk some in cloud mining.

If you know his Electrum password, then you can proceed.
