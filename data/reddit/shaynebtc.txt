Don't cash out. HODL
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:56:29
Because trading should be compared to HODLing. When you HODL, your bitcoin balance stays constant. If you trade and your bitcoin balance decreases over time then you would have been better off just HODLing.

But it's not even a cryptocurrency! It's a centralised payments network that doesn't even require a token of it's own. The token is just a way for the founders of the company to get rich and have control.

Each node would be able to tell which one of two or more transactions it saw first. Given enough of a buffer to compensate for latency and propagation delays (say 10s, or maybe even as much as 30s), you could say that any one of a number of transactions received between seeing the first and the last are valid. Any new transaction after that would only be allowed if it didn't change the outputs respective to the chosen transaction from the time window before it.
@_date: 2015-12-14 19:52:55
The one seen first would be the real one. I suppose then you're gonna say that some nodes would see transaction A first, and others would see transaction B first, due to unpredictable network propagation. But since transactions generally reach at least 90% of all nodes within 5 to 10 seconds, you could say that any transaction within a window of 10 seconds from the first transaction is valid.
This would mean that as long as a merchant waits 10 seconds after seeing the transaction achieve 90% propagation, it can be considered safe and not double-spendable after that. The only way you could replace a transaction after it has achieved 90% propagation is to replace it with one that doesn't change or modify the ouputs.
@_date: 2015-12-14 20:51:29
Because you still need a place to record the transaction history, and you still need a mechanism for soft-forking the blockchain in case not all miners agree on this consensus rule. This is just an added security feature to give more confidence to zero confirmation transactions. If the majority of miners choose to enforce this rule then users can be statistically more certain that a double-spend won't be performed on an unconfirmed transaction.
That's not to say that the majority of miners wouldn't change their minds and stop enforcing this rule. But after a sufficiently long history of seeing this being enforced in the longest chain of valid blocks, a user could be fairly confident that such a pattern will continue to hold. It doesn't give them 100% certainty, but it improves on the current situation of 0% certainty.
@_date: 2015-12-14 23:00:25
Excuse me if this is a silly question, but please tell me why such things (policy) "cannot" be tied to consensus rules? Also, as I understand it, the version of RBF that was recently merged into Core is Opt-in-Full-RBF, which allows the replacement transaction to change the outputs. Why was this done? What valid reason would there **EVER** be to change the outputs?
How exactly was FSS-RBF found to be too restrictive? If you wouldn't mind, I'd like a technical explanation for why this idea will not work.
@_date: 2015-12-15 00:15:37
Okay, I agree that every node sees transactions in a different way, so you cannot agree on "seen order" to a very high accuracy. However, nodes should be able to agree on "seen order" to within 30 seconds accuracy (due to statistical average propagation speed). So for example:
Node1: sees txA at 23:00:00 UTC
Node2: sees txB at 23:00:05 UTC
Node2: sees txA at 23:00:25 UTC
Node1: sees txB at 23:00:29 UTC
At this stage both nodes could agree that either txA or txB are valid (even if they have different outputs from each other), and would choose to mine the one with the highest fee. They can agree on this because for each miner, even if they had different clocks in different time zones, the time between receiving the two transactions was less than 30s. For Node1 it was 29s and for Node2 it was 20s. They wouldn't be able to agree on the order of the transactions, but that doesn't matter here.
Now if a little bit later both nodes see a third transaction:
Node1: sees txC at 23:00:35 UTC
Node2: sees txC at 23:00:40 UTC
At this stage both nodes can agree that txC was seen after txA and txB, because both of them can see that the time elapsed between receiving the first tx and the last tx was greater than 30s. Now if both nodes agree on a consensus rule here that txC may only add an input, and not change outputs, it allows users to fix "stuck" transactions while at the same time preventing double spends of unconfirmed transactions that have been seen for longer than 30s.
From what I understand, transactions typically reach 90% of nodes within 5 to 10 seconds, so waiting 30 seconds is quite a conservative value to use to be "extra sure".
If the nodes disagree on enforcing this as a consensus rule then there would be a fork, and then may the best side win. I think it should be in every miner's best interest to enhance the protection against double spending of unconfirmed transactions in this way, as it would increase confidence in the network and enable use cases that rely on zero confirmation transactions being at least partially trustworthy (such as in a coffee shop). This would be positive for the price and longevity of the network.
Without this, I would have to wait in line at the cashier for 10 minutes for every point of sale purchase I make, which seriously reduces the utility of bitcoin, which would also be bad for miners.
With the current Opt-in-Full-RBF in Core, I can guarantee that wallets will be developed which make double spending transactions trivial, people will start using them, and that will instantly lead to a lot of bad press that we can't afford right now and would seriously harm the prospects of bitcoin becoming mainstream.
The convenience of "simply reducing your change output" is not worth destroying the viability of accepting zero confirmation transactions.

This is huge
@_date: 2015-12-14 20:02:19
I don't see how implementing this idea could be a bad thing. It only adds an additional layer of protection onto what is already there.
@_date: 2015-12-14 19:58:27
Yes, a greedy miner could choose to ignore this consensus rule and include the double spend transaction instead in order to claim a higher fee, but as long as they remain in the minority, then the honest side of the fork would remain the longest.

Nice idea, but you may as well just have one block type/difficulty and set the block time to be less than 10 min. This has already been discussed to the death and the conclusion is that it is time itself that gives certainty to the validity of transactions, so you'd end up having to wait for more confirmations, bringing you back to square one.
@_date: 2017-02-09 00:25:44
I think that all crypto exchanges should pledge to support trading on both sides of any chain splits that occur due to a rift in the community. However, if a malicious group of miners come out of nowhere and hard fork to something that hasn't already been heavily debated, they should ignore it and stay on the original chain, even if it has much less hashrate.
@_date: 2016-01-20 23:55:05
This has already been proposed, and I think it's a good idea worth exploring further.  However, IIRC some Core developers have expressed negative opinions or possible security vulnerabilities that need to be solved.
@_date: 2016-01-21 00:29:42
How so? And what is the problem with that?
@_date: 2016-01-18 22:15:20
Thanks. But I think you're talking about a different kind of double spending now. You're talking about the kind of double spend where the attacker sends the double spend only to a colluding "bad" miner, in which case the likelyhood of success is limited by the hashrate of that miner/pool. Of course there will never be a way to entirely prevent that kind of double spend attack. The best defense against that type of attack is to ensure that mining never becomes too centralized and that no mining pool ever becomes "too big".
The kind of double spending I was talking about is the one where the attacker simply broadcasts another transaction to the whole network, but with a higher fee. If we can measure and determine a reliable metric for how long a transaction takes to propogate to 90% of the network, then I think my proposal is still worth considering.
Of course Lightning is still a brilliant idea that should be worked on, but I don't see why we shouldn't try to make the underlying settlement layer (Bitcoin) as safe as possible without it. IIRC another problem with Lightning that nobody seems to be too worried about is that you need to "freeze" or "bond" some of your money away in one or more (probably many) payment channels for it to be useful and not everyone will have the requisite cashflow to be able to afford that.
@_date: 2017-03-11 04:01:15

Having SegWit doesn't force people into using LN, you idiot. Individuals will remain free to transact on-chain even if others choose to use LN. And yes, "market based consensus" is NOT Bitcoin.

I've been pretty much on the fence regarding Core/Classic myself, but have recently decided to stick with Core. However, people need to understand that if we hard fork to Classic it's not permanent. We could just as easily start using the Core client again as soon as they've completed SW and/or 2MB themselves.

Large miners could just collude to add fake transactions to themselves in order to fill up blocks so that the next max block size gets bigger on every difficulty change. Eventually the block size will become too big for small miners with lower bandwidth to compete.

The hardware wallet creates and signs the bitcoin transactions inside itself, and then sends the signed transaction to the Internet where other computers can verify the signature using the public key associated with the sending address (no computer except yours needs to see the private key).
