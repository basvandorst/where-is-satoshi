Heres a comment i wrote earlier, might be helpful(for someone asking how to day trade)
Don't invest however unless your willing to lose everything.
I haven't really done too much trading but heres a few which helped me increase my 150 initial investment into about 700 dollars over the last few weeks.(a few very lucky trades- could have been in the thousands if not for many smaller unlucky ones)
* After buying bitcoins on mtgox transfer some bitcoins to at least three other exchanges. Personally I use Btc-e, Cavirtex(very high rates), and a little on mtgox, just for when they add litecoin, ppcoin, or namecoin, so I can cash out a bit. Also look into vircurex, they were down for a few days two weeks ago, but have gotten new servers, so seem to be fairly solid now.    This is especially necessary given all the mtgox ddos attacks. And if day trading you don't want too many coins in your wallet given that it would take you at least an hour to get them onto and trade ready on any exchange.
* try avoiding buy high and sell low, I know it seems unlikely that you'd do such a thing, but as your seeing the value of your coins plummeting you might just panic sell, or buy seeing the price rise slightly.(note; **This rule requires a lot of interpretation, and is basically don't panic**)
* Prices slow down, and might fall a bit on weekends,
* exchanges rates might differ by as much as ten percent
* If day trading look into alt coins, as they are quite a bit more volatile, and some seem likely to increase in value(regardless of whether or not they are worse or superior to bitcoin), if mtgox fixes its issues and implements them(as its been hinting).
* Never trust the troll box, listen to it sure, but make enquiries elsewhere about anything said on it.
Good luck, and tell us if you have any success
EDIT; Beware however, you could make a truckload or lose everything. So even if you make a bunch, be sure to cash out your initial investment.

Almost none, I finally met someone else who'd heard about it a month or so ago - and he had quit after loosing a couple hundred dollars in the April crash. Although my cousin did ask if he could buy some Bitcoin off me a couple months ago as his friends were looking into buying some. 
Local Bitcoins is limited to a couple of sketchy dealers with 0-3 transaction each.
I think a good part of this is due to the frequent Load shedding, and poor internet connection here. In some cities(Lahore) for instance, power goes for 8-14 hours daily.

Sorry for the late reply, just got back from uni.
The power situation here is less due to infrastructure(although it is pretty bad), and more due to a sheer shortage of electricity - we don't have enough power plants, and those we do have are operating far below capacity due to mismanagement.
Our internet's a little better as you can get 4mbps(400 kbps down 50 up) via cable for about $20 a month, although it will die three or four times a month. And "10 mbps" wireless for about $30, but that usually only gets up to about 200kbps up and down.
@_date: 2013-11-13 21:59:03
Sorry but that line of reasoning is flawed. Although I do think Bitcoin will do well, possibly even $10,000 ea, you can't just say that its been rising despite the doubters, so it'll just continue rising to infinity.
You could just as easily apply this to a value of 10,000,000,000 per bitcoin as to 10,000.
@_date: 2013-11-03 20:52:15
I haven't looked at it too closely, but I wouldn't put more than a dollar or two into it, As most alt-coins are just useless copies which no one really supports.
Currently the only altcoins worth looking at are PPC,XPM,NMC,LTC, and to a very very limited extent NVC, AND DVC.
Although NMC is having a few issues of its own...

It does get a little bit easier if you arbitrate(right word?) between bitcoins and altcoins rather than bitcoins and usd. As it's  much faster, and its quite a bit easier to withdraw funds.
It used to be quite profitable, for a couple of days to buy PTS on English exchanges for BTC, sell it on Chinese exchange BTC38 for about 1.15x more BTC.
If you have some funds divided amongst a couple of the bigger altcoin exchanges you can generally make some money, by seeing when theres a price difference, buying on the cheaper exchange and selling on the more expensive one.
Right now for example, most altcoins are overpriced on Vircurex(most coins were about 5 percent overpriced today morning), so if you go about it slowly, you could probably make some  money by buying from btc-e and selling there. But the tiny volume on vircurex could mean that if you try it, you might just end up flooding the market on vircurex, and bringing it back to the norm.

I think they'll exist, but they won't be nearly as common or as large as todays banks.
Computers are still a relatively new technology, and have only been really started becoming "necessary" for the vast majority of the populace in the last ~10 years or so. I think that by the time Bitcoins truly start to gain a hold(as in are used by everyone for daily stuff) the combination of increasing computer literacy and various tools being built could mean that quite a few users just hold their bitcoins themselves.

You're probably right, I've edited my original statement.
@_date: 2013-11-03 20:26:29
There's still time to buy bitcoin, and while you might not make $29 to $1,000,000 profits, you might still make $200 to $1,000-10,000 profits.
//Assuming bitcoin succeeds, no attacks, gov intervention, etc...
If thats not your cup of tea, you could try some of the promising alt-coins such as Peercoin(PPC), Primecoin(XPM), or Namecoin(NMC).  but they're quite a bit more volatile, and a $100 investment could end up turning into &gt;$10,000 or $0.01&lt;.
edit: be aware though, that NMC is having a few issues, and its value could either rise or crash in December.

Sorry but this is completely off, 
* The media attention chart is completely wrong, as there wasn't any significant drip but it has been continuoulsly rising(paypal, african wallmart etc...).
*The fall in price was much more drastic, same with the rise
*the mean should be much higher.
* There have been more than one dip. (i.e. it fell to 50 first dip,  rose to 150 and fell slowly to 120 second dip, and is now at 140-150)
@_date: 2013-12-04 11:35:29
I honestly disagree. 
I think most altcoins can be divided into three categories, namely innovative coins, copy coins, and scamcoins.
Where innovative coins introduce changes and new features. And are generally proper attempts at improving crypto currencies, introducing viable bitcoin alternatives/complimentary currencies.
Examples of which include 
* Namecoin and DNS,
* Peercoin and Proof of Stake/Inflation,
* Primecoin and Scientific utility,
* Anoncoin and attempted Zerocoin implementation, 
* Proto/Bit shares(? perhaps - I need to read up on this one) as shares in an attempted distributed autonomous corporation.
* Colored/Master coins and whatever the hell they do.
Then you have copy coins which basically just clone another coin, perhaps changing a few variables. These are generally just attempts to make a quick buck.
Examples of this,
* Novacoin
* Feathercoin
* Terracoin
And Lastly we have scam coins, which are a more devious version of Copy coins, where theres usually some underlying scam.
Examples of this include
Quark, as you've all know. With its massive premine, fake hype, etc...
Perhaps megacoin(?)
Phenixex coin, which was related to the fake exchange phenixex.com.
 The line between copy and scam coins is often quite blurry, as sometimes coins which began as a scam wound up becoming proper copy coins.(Perhaps Feathercoin)

I havent read the links provided yet(So speculation) but
Simple, it isn't voting via bitcoin directly, but through a coin built atop the bitcoin protocol, issued by the government(like a digital asset). So the body incharge of it just sends one coin to every registered voter. 
Double voting wouldn't really be an issue as no one else could issue the coins, so although someone might send half a coin to two different people, it could just be interpreted as them giving half a vote to each of them.
As for how only one vote per citizen, just have citizens register to vote be provided a paper wallet with the code.

That's only if you believe there can only be one cryptocurrency, I don't. I think that there will be at least two to four big cryptocurrencies, and so I've bought a couple hundred dollars worth of those few I think have a shot.
Addittionally said currencies wouldn't have to be substanially better, but only sufficiently different, as is done by primecoin(through Cunningham chains instead of hashcash mining), ppcoin(proof of stake designed for 1%inflation per year), and namecoin(through domains).

Well  regarding suggestions
* Buy all the alternate domains. (.com, .bit, .net, .edu, etc...) Given the nature of Bitcoin you'll probably see several scam phishing websites.
* Look into making making several wallets, and setting things up so that no one person can access the funds. Even if no one decides to run off with the funds, people's passwords can be hacked.
* Maybe make it so sellers can accept some of the bigger alts(PPC,NMC,LTC) if they want to. This shouldn't be too much more difficult, and has no real downside. And would prevent a newer site from using it as a way to pull users.
*  Include an automatic delivery system for digital goods - So things such as ebooks, indie games, steam keys etc could be sold. You might want to limit this to trusted sellers however to prevent people from selling fake keys and so you wouldn't need to verify things yourself.
* Make it global, rather than limited to US sellers only. Most of Asia lacks a good online ebay type website, and if bitcoin makes it here there shouldn't be too many issues.
* Include a way to sell services such as copy writing, coding, etc...
* Include some form of active ranking in users feedback pages - so we can check whether people giving positive or negative feedback have proper accounts, or are all brand new accounts. (e.g. a box next to a reviewer's name giving age of account, transactions and hours spent online.)
* Sell a few products yourself, such as Prepaid credit cards, membership cards for a few games, itunes cards, etc...

Websites could enable microtransactions to disable ads. Say you want to watch some videos youtube, rather than having to sit through ~10 minutes worth of ads for every hour of videos, you simply shoot over 10 cents, and buy 5 hours of ad free Youtube.
There could also be a " buy everyone at the bar a round of drinks" version, where you pay a couple of dollars to make every video by a user ad free for an hour or two, etc...
Chapter by chapter ebooks / Webcomics / Manga - I'd love it if the japanese publishers made a way for me to pay a couple dollars to read manga online.
Game Memberships, Children/Teenagers who have little access to methods of online payment such as paypal or credit cards form a part of Bitcoin's market(prepaid credit cards are pretty rare in asia/africa.). It'd be amazing if you could just go to a random moneychanger, but a few dollars worth of bitcoin, and pay for your online memberships.
