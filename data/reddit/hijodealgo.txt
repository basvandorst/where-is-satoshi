They write you a bad check and it clears your account. You send them 3k then check bounces days later at regional bank. Then your account goes negative they’re gone w money. I was selling a car but I waited on their check it bounced 3 days later cause it was supposed to be a wire.

Peter is the classic older generation guy. Technology is moving at an exponential pace. What if miners find a giant gold vein with some new gold scanning technology. Or they can mine one of those asteroids in space in the next 10 years. Influx of gold supply would crush its value 
It would take one large discovery and there go your savings.

It’s like the next dot com boom. My uncle is 48 and retired for years because he was in the market during that time in the 90s. 
This space is going to grow and I don’t think we will see another longer than a month bear until after the halvening next May.
Unless one piece of news takes the price to all time highs this summer then I could see the large correction and multi month bear. But not yet with so much hanging in balance. Facebook, etfs etc 
I am puzzled myself what are good exit points. Now at 12k I’ve made some good $, but I know there is more upside. Hope rather, don’t know
At least it’s exciting

It’s not possible. There would have to be a surge of buy orders to clear out all those sellers. Then It would go up from there

It’s ppl sitting in tether buying back to btc. Then when they think it’s going to drop they swap back to tether

I bought a bunch above 10k last year. Also kept at it when we were under 4K. So now my investment finally starting to look really good. 
I still think there’s not going to be any huge pullbacks below 8k based on news currently. Institutions starting to buy. Halvening approaching. Facebook creating awareness. 
Fed rate cuts might come in a couple weeks. Just go for it. Think 3-5 years and you won’t sweat the entry point so much

Watched him on Joe Rogan and actually didn’t hate the freedom dividend once he explained it fully. Also giving every American 100$ to contribute to one candidate is a cool idea

I guess they are referring to very poor countries where access is limited. But why would they not be able to use other apps to access internet or is it because it’s just easier
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:07:20

I feel it effects my mood. Even on big runs if I check it and it’s gone down the slightest For some reason I’m pissed. Even though it’s a long term thing for me. Always checking can’t help it. Exciting stuff

I’ve thought about it. But I like having a horse the the race. Just never ever sell what you’re holding then you still might be ok
