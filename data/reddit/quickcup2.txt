Congrats.  I thought I did well by getting 15% when I sold it a few months back.

It’s cute but likely wrong.

No, bitcoin was made to get rid of socialists like you.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:40:27
You seem to be implying you won’t get the 2x coins if you leave your bitcoin on your Trezor, you will and likely faster seeing as how coinbase still has not given people their bcash.

You’ll have the new coins by keeping your bitcoin on the ledger.  You’ll also have immediate access to them.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:58:21
Doesn't matter.  If the other coin wins, crypto is dead.  You lose either way.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:08:03
fair enough

Why is anyone responding?  This is the lamest troll I have ever seen.  In fact it might even be satire.
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:58:22
All pretty cool guys if you ask me.

 u dumb
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:38:05
Basically a nobody that sells useless supplements.  People have theorized he latched onto bitcoin to get attention.
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:46:19
Oh look, I found someone that doesn’t understand the tech.  It’s ok, it’s pretty complicated.  Most people with a sub 100 iq won’t get it.
@_date: 2017-09-19 02:28:22
Yes.  Move all your btc to another wallet with a new seed first.

We will smash them. And you too if you get in our way.

There is little worse than people who carry water for evil.  They think it’s cool to be a nihilist.  They are very scared insecure people who will back whatever team they think is winning because that makes them a winner by proxy.
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:13:01
It’s stupid
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:09:27
What’s a satoshi worth?  Essentially nothing.  That’s your answer.

Drug dealing is illegal.  It is not however a crime.

Bad advice.  Dca means you will end up with less units.

No.  Why?  Because it has been above 4900.
@_date: 2017-09-19 22:22:30
The coins have been cheaper than this almost all year.  What were you waiting for?  You don’t deserve cheap coins.  Stop rooting for things that hurt other people.  It kind of makes you an asshole.  At the very least shut up about it.
@_date: 2017-09-18 21:33:26
Dca is dumb.  Really dumb.  Look it up.

No way did $20 buy that much in 98.
@_date: 2017-10-04 15:25:54
Wrong.  It does yield dividends.  And even if it didn’t you’d still be wrong.
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:58:43
Hopefully it won’t go down so she can’t buy more.
