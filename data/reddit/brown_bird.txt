Would this apply to all new beginners though? Some are not specifically seeking privacy or private transactions per se.
Ok, it is important that beginners realize bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous and not anonymous.

Wow I'm actually amazed at how many replies and votes I'm getting on this! Thanks for participating in the poll on twitter &amp; your replies here - which are super interesting to say the least. 
I've also made a page for beginners to inform [where &amp; how to buy bitcoin safely]( using a card / cash / bank transfer. Perhaps your friends or colleagues starting in bitcoin might find it useful to read through before purchasing their first coins. 
EDIT: Many have mentioned extra tips for beginners in the comments. Here are my favorite so far:
- Send small amount of coins to wallet when doing first-time withdrawal from exchange. 
- Make proper &amp; multiple offline backups of wallet
- For full control of your BTC always have full control of the keys.

This was the sad realization for all the day-traders on Gox in 2014. Hopefully serious investors all have this engraved on a wall somewhere.

Nicely said. Though multisig can sometimes be an exception to this rule - right?

In my opinion there are two different ways that a new user might start off in bitcoin:
- **the centralized approach** - The new user may not have spent much time diving deep into recommendations online. They usually just need to buy bitcoin really easily (on centralized KYC exchanges), withdraw it to somewhere convenient (centralized 'key-less' online wallet providers) and spend/send it off. For this demographic there is plenty of [good advice]( to get bitcoin easily while staying safe. However, these users may not care about the "essence" of bitcoin and just need to get in and out quickly to accomplish what it is they need to do. Increasingly (and unfortunately) this use-case regroups individuals that are paying off a ransomware or escaping some form of governmental capital controls. 
- **the decentralized approach** - The new user has heard about bitcoin and actively wants to invest their value and time in the technology. This type of user really wants to learn more but constantly falls on recommendations advising them to use traditional centralized exchanges. In most forum posts and quick guides, no mention is made about the importance of not storing coins in exchanges, online wallets, or 'compromizable' PCs. This type of new user either eventually discovers how to [use bitcoin in a decentralized manner]( or may make a couple of mistakes along the road and learn the hard way. But the most important thing for us is to educate more about decentralized p2p exchanges, offline wallets, backups, paper wallets, and sometimes even brain wallets. Progressively these decentralized behaviors in bitcoin will become mainstream, fun, and popular. When this happens the bitcoin space will be thrive and safety will be omnipresent for new users... just like torrenting (ok live torrent streaming still has more potential).
New users should be directed towards the right approach to learning and buying bitcoin. But this need to realistically reflect their needs

Proper backups! Damn that's actually a good one. I remember hearing all the stories of guys accidentally throwing away old hard disks with thousands of bitcoin on them.

Interesting. Why Bittrex for a beginner? I thought they focus on selling cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2016-10-26 15:16:27
Ah yes Circle. Good option for beginner users too. Only 4 choices on twitter polls.
@_date: 2016-10-26 15:23:11
Bitpay is definitely a large player in this field. Their payment solutions work great, and little know-how is needed. 
Have they started selling btc directly to users though? This could be big.

Dad &amp; moms need to know! Coinbase is there on the poll. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 15:15:02
Yep, they're on the poll list.
@_date: 2016-10-26 15:19:42
Yep I do agree here. Makes sense for them to be recommended to beginners as there a pretty high confidence rating from past users and in my own experience too. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 15:24:48


Yes. See my comment below. 


That's also an option. Only hindsight will tell how good that advice may have been 2 years down the line. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 15:08:09
Also an option. Perhaps the least risky choice. Yet she learns little in this case. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 15:17:28
Hilarious answers to this comment. Let's say US/EU ?
