Never would I have thought that when I first bought bitcoin in august that it would be 14K right now and still experience FUD.

Just sold half my altcoins to go back into daddy bitcoin. Based on TA and the stagnation of bitcoin during altcoin season this seems like a no brainer. Charting showing bitcoin hitting 25-30k in the coming weeks. Anyone agree or disagree?

Why TF are there so many weak handed people? It's annoying i have to coexist.

Can you buy on coinbase again yet?

r/bitcoin what do ya say?  Giant pump over Christmas??
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:04:11
Makes sense to me. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:24:20
People are finally starting to see how fantastic NEO is!
@_date: 2018-09-23 01:14:38
The 15 mins of fame touching mainstream audiences is what caused the unhealthy pump. Once Bitcoin shows steady rising in price again, it’s reintroduction into the mainstream audience won’t be as intense. A slow healthy rise is what we all want.

I, Jeff Bezos, will honor this idea. Once again I, the  real Jeff Bezos, will do just that. Thank you.

I loved my visit to Tokyo and Kyoto this past April. I took a pic of this location (shibuya crossing) as well. Unfortunately couldn’t find many places that accepted bitcoin. In fact most people still use Fiat (especially Kyoto) which surprised me. But it’s still a really big deal that the most prominent ad in the most populated single area in all of Tokyo is Bitcoin!

Early April is when we'll have a clear indication of if the bears or bulls will win out. We're still stuck in this wedge. The price movement the past few weeks means nothing to me other than to confirm that it's 50/50. I have money on the sidelines if we break to the downside to cost average and I have scalping and reallocation strategies if we break to the upside. Just be prepared and have a plan and you'll make money regardless in the long run unless we drop to 0 which I give a 2% chance.... I like my odds.
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:36:54
It's unsustainable... hopefully since I just put a limit order in at 3k :(((
@_date: 2017-09-20 13:32:49
My peen just moved a little bit reading the title. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 13:50:46
Haha fair but I've always had the downward trend line and long term upward trend line connecting right around April 10th so I feel it'll be any moment before then. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 00:08:35
There are still too many scarred by the crash without mass exuberance to counteract it. Until we are free from the"BULL MARKET COMING" messages and until despair and hopelessness saturates the market, we will not see any definitive upwards momentum. We need a clean wipe of any non true hodlers. Determining what price that is is the hard part. Hodlers who choose their cost average prices wisely with small % strikes at these buy in points are the real winners. If you have no capital on the sideline then you will no longer be a true hodler if you keep checking the price... you will wilt. I will make money and I will be rich because I choose to and I will not give in to emotion and I will buy a little here and little if/when it goes lower. The choice is yours. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:16:17
Correct. People need to be patient. It will be a slow rise before it becomes parabolic.
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:42:12
Someone doesn't understand what "support" means. This is the equivalent of claiming BTC is about to hit 20k after gaining 15% more investors (China's volume). Be realistic and use your head. 3K is where the bleeding ends if it breaks under $3600. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 00:37:02
Based on the past, this only shows BTC likely dropping quite a bit more... but yes I agree buy the dips (average down)
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:01:02
oh wait nvm I have no idea.
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:00:06
BTC couldn't find support at their 4k levels. It was 50/50 that it would have under a normal market climate. Considering the incredible FUD surrounding China, it made it way more likely to not catch support. Now we see if the 3500 support line will hold (I highly doubt it). Best case scenario we bounce back up after breaking the 3k line which is fine with me. Average down and/or ride it out, bud. We need to clear this annoyance in China before mr. bull comes back. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 15:54:04
buy low, hodl high.

WAIT NO IT'S $86.48 ... SELL!!! SELL!!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:44:00
No because then you'll be accepting and cashing out at tiny losses. Averaging down lowers your break even point. The opposite raises your break even point. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:10:51
I hope its a slow drain for the rest of the month before mr bull reenters so I can make some big purchases and catch some monster crypto booms $$$$$$$$$

Peter Schiff is a brilliant businessman. His views on capitalism, unemployment, and market trends are insightful but he cannot grasp the idea that currencies can thrive with no backing. It's notable to add he essentially sells gold so take what he says about something that is anti-fiat with a grain of salt.

50 day moving average about to cross the 200 day moving average. Big indicator to buy, people!! Last time this happened was last week and the price went from 3500 to 4k in less than a day!
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:00:00
$8,648 buy and hodl :)
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:37:35
he ain't need no education where we goin ^^^^
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:01:24
It's very simple -- it's the trend line that shows the overall average of prices in a specific time frame. Yes, it's a lagging indicator and measures past behavior but it has been unusually accurate for me. When the 50 day MA slices upwards through the 200 day MA, buy buy buy. FUD in the next upcoming weeks will happen but as of right this second, I see a big bump in price coming. I know this is a traders mentality, but I HODL, buy and sell from a lot of price ranges to maximize profit while simultaneously supporting the future I believe in.

ELI5 - Aren't powerhouses like coinbase, bittrex, and poloniex all US exchanges? Who cares if Chinese exchanges are banned? 
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:54:45
If it breaks this next layer of resistance it'll hit 5k by next week. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:23:19
@_date: 2017-09-22 07:24:34
After the beating he took when he said exchanges were going to be banned and he ended up being correct, I find it very unlikely he's wrong here. Maybe for one weekend there won't be blood!!
@_date: 2017-10-01 14:36:49
Yeah this'll work 
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:27:57
So in other words, this shuts down all exchange activity in China not just Chinese created exchanges? 
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:40:24
Ohhh now I still don't get it.
@_date: 2017-09-29 12:01:07
Haha Japan just gave the middle finger to china, Russia and South Korea 
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:09:39
Average down at big potential support intervals. 3600(passed) , 3250, 3000
@_date: 2017-10-08 01:45:23

@_date: 2017-09-14 23:32:36
If you're in, average down if you'd like. If you're out, patience young padawans. Buy in period isn't far. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:34:39
What gives anything value? Trust, universal acceptance, supply and demand. There is a reason the price was where it's at, it's not magic. The concept of decentralized currency should be what everyone is fighting for and the only way to do it is to make it intangible so government cannot take it away. If you believe this then why the hell not buy into it and put your money to good use? Besides, check charts... bitcoin has had FAR bigger losses than this and ultimately surged. A brilliant idea cannot be stopped just delayed. Bitcoin cannot be stopped... just delayed.
