Good point. I was just shocked by the fees last time I transferred to my wallet.

Wtf does that mean? Drop “Repealing” and I agree with that statement

The average BTC enthusiast is probably a bit less libertarian than a year ago, but I’ve heard some libertarian arguments for UBI. If you got rid of all the current hand outs and tax deductions and replaced them with this single no strings attached payment, it might lead to better outcomes overall. We should be focused on increasing the size of the pie though, and that’s best left up to the free market.

I agree, but one generic hand out is better than a bunch that are focused on socially engineering the poor, and keeping them that way.

How are they surviving now? Couldn’t some of that extra cash be saved or invested assuming that they are surviving currently?


Who proposed giving money to the rich? What does the *local* economy have to do with anything??
You don’t need a middle man like the federal government to redistribute wealth. You just need the creative destruction that would otherwise exist absent an interventionist state. The wealthy use the state for their own purposes at the moment, and it keeps the little guy down. That’s what we should be fixing.

Nope, website. Wish they had an app, but too much could probably go wrong over spotty cellular connections. Oh, their website seems to work well on mobile safari.

Or if you have a regular bank transfer in progress on Gemini and they spotted you $500.

~~Don't use coinbase.~~ Be careful using coinbase. Fees are a lot higher than exchanges like GDAX, which is funny because Coinbase runs that.

Given the fact that I just gained some bitcoin by selling on GDAX and buying on another exchange, there's definitely a spread. I don't expect it to last long. The newbs will figure out how to get accounts at these other exchanges.

So what else is morally justified if there’s a politician thousands of miles away “representing “ you? Slavery? Intimidation? Murder?

Well, Satoshi supposedly has over a million bitcoin (right?), so how painful is tens of millions when you have hundreds of millions?

What I really need to know is how many Lambos is a Bugatti?

2008 wasn't a stock market meltdown. It was a banking/lending meltdown. Of course stocks took a bit hit because people needed to delever to cover other margin calls.
What does "stock market cap to GDP ratio" mean in globally traded equity markets? Do you a source for that?
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:58:53
That’s like saying my average home shouldn’t be worth 1% more than gdp per capita in a rational market, which is absurd. I think that link is confusing wealth with annual income. Stocks vs flows. You can’t just pick one to determine an overpriced asset. Prices and valuations just reflect scarcity. If everyone sold at once, there’d be no scarcity, and prices would plummet. And the converse is true as well. Plus, if our market is overvalued, some other country’s might be undervalued, or it just accurately reflects the global market sentiment.

Nice work! This is a much better use of fiat currency than being wadded up in someone’s pocket guaranteed to lose value every second of the day!
