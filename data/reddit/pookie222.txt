Good article, thanks for linking. I particularlly liked the point-by-point analysis of the properties of bitcoin. I wonder though what basis the author has when he states, "Cypriots apparently did not move into Bitcoin in significant numbers"?

Is there any reason I don't see much mentioned of people using Dwolla lately? As I understand it you can link your bank account through Dwolla and then use those funds to buy/sell directly on Mt.Gox (within certain limitations).

I had this same experience. I tried to log into Bitstamp and got a page asking for a CAPTCHA. When I entered the CAPTCHA it still didn't connect me to Bitstamp. I checked on  and it said that Bitstamp is up and running so I don't know whats going on.     
        
edit: looks like data from Bitstamp is showing up on Bitcoinity.

Okay. I'm going to give it a try this evening. Thanks for your help.

Whether or not having a Dwolla Account is worth it is up to the individual, but I will say this much. Having a Dwolla Account is one of the few options that allow you to link directly to a bank account, so you can move funds between said bank account and Mt Gox without ever leaving your computer.

I used Bitinstant twice back when I initally bought my BTC's (July 2012), never had any issues.

An [article]( from Huff Post printed last year that sums up my feeling on HFT and similiar exploits. It's written with regards to Wall Street but applies just as equally to MtGox or any large exchange.

I create a new wallet.dat by downloading a new copy of Bitcoin-Qt and installing it, and then I can make the transfer from my old wallet to my new one?
edit: okay, i think i've got it, some googling found this -
With Bitcoin-QT the wallet file is called “wallet.dat.”  Shut down Bitcoin-QT and rename the wallet.dat file. In Windows it is usually at C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin\wallet.dat 
Just restart Bitcoin-QT and a new wallet will automatically be generated.

Just wanted to give a quick update. I transferred my coins from my Bitcoin-QT wallet to my Mt.Gox account. Then I erased the old wallet.dat file (after making a backup of course, just in case) and installed the latest version of Bitcoin-QT which created a new empty wallet with a new wallet.dat file. Finally I transferred my coins back from Mt.Gox into my new empty wallet. All in all it went pretty smoothly. The biggest hangups were (a)my pc's gpu is acting kind of glitchy and (b)my old wallet was more than a year out of sync. Thanks again for your help.

Gotta love Bitcoinity. Even when the site's down they're *still* awesome.
