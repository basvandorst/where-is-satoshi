BTC never got anywhere near $19,500 today, what's that about?
@_date: 2018-05-29 15:33:41
The long-term goal is to end all incentive to sell, which is that you can buy goods and services as easily with BTC as cash. Expand the market for BTC and that simultaneously solves the sell problem.

Letting taxpayers choose exactly where their tax money goes would be a step in the right direction. The liberal could put all of his money towards the things he enjoys, like roads, schools, planned parenthood, while the conservative could fund the military and police. Pundits will have their own recommended % for each sector, and people would follow them as a guideline, and the net result would be that services with more funding than they provide value would lose funding. Everyone wins.
@_date: 2014-11-18 01:54:44
Tolls are much easier today, with EZ-pass. Face it, it's the fairest way to fund a road, a direct cost for use. Nobody else pays it than those who use it. There are always alternative routes, so we could have apps that determine the cheapest route, and they'd have peak and non-peak pricing. Trucks would probably choose to drive more at night for lower pricing as well.

With theft, you are taking care of the general welfare of the thief and his family, not to mention injecting money into the local economy. So theft is actually good, since it creates jobs and shit, and circulates the money more, which creates...umm... prosperity or some bullshit. Taxation, on the other hand, uses costly bureaucracy to redistribute money from us to other people, so is actually costlier than thieves robbing you. Next time I'm robbed, I'm going to say "thank you for your efficient redistribution service. You have cut out the middleman and went straight for the economic stimulus material."

Public schools cost taxpayers right around $10k/student-year, so $250k per class. The teacher only gets maybe 1/5 of that. Think of any privatized system, and that amount would go down. The only reason private schools are expensive is that only the rich can, or are willing, to pay both property taxes AND tuition. Education should cost a fraction, and go down in cost with the internet. We instead are paying 3x what it cost in the 1970s, inflation adjusted.

Competition arises naturally, not by another monopoly dictating to the market. The more a company profits, the more incentive it offers competitors to compete for that profit, that marketshare. The government - being itself a $60Trillion coercively-funded monopoly - is the only creator of other monopolies. One example is the taxi medallion system in large cities, whereby the govt sustains that monopoly, who then overcharge customers, because the cost of a medallion is now nearly $1Million in places like NYC.
[Myth of the robber barons](
Companies keep their shareholders happy ONLY by creating the highest value they can, which requires keeping customers happy, which happens by giving customers more value than competitors do.
Voting is literally almost worthless. You get a 1 out of X,000,000 say in how some popularity contest winner spends 30% of your income for you. That's worthless. No election has hinged on 1 vote. You have zero effect. The winner then can lie and not keep their campaign promises, at no risk. You can't exchange them, or get a refund (your vote was free). When you shop, you have 100% control over your money. You have many choices, including to not buy. If the product lies, you return it THE SAME DAY, not 4 years later for a mere exchange.
CEOs control *voluntarily-funded* wealth. Politicians control coercively-extracted wealth (taxation). **HUGE DIFFERENCE**.

False. The money comes from people's income, who then are coerced to fund these services. The roads themselves are built by self-interested people making them for hourly wages. Government just skims off the top. Look, are skyscrapers or smartphones dependent on governments to exist and fund? No, so why do you think something like bridges and paved slabs of asphalt require coercion (taxation)?
@_date: 2014-11-18 05:11:21
The "annual fee" has increased from around 7% of GDP, to now around 30% of GDP. We have no real choice. [Taxation has made the area around D.C. contain 13 of the richest 30 counties.](
We spend 3x as much as in 1970s with no increase in achievement. Detroit schools cost taxpayers $15k/student-year while only 25% graduate. The natl avg is $10k/yr.

And therein you see why the politicians want to destroy any company or small group of people who have the capacity to VOLUNTARILY fund such endeavors. Politicians are a cabal of a few hundred people controlling over $2 Trillion per year, coerced from us as taxes, so they want to destroy the capacity of any voluntarily-funded entity from getting large enough to fund their own large infrastructure projects. Hint: anti-trust legislation, progressive income taxes. Would we not prefer to live in a world "ruled" by google, apple, ikea, UPS, rather than politicians, the DEA, IRS, DMV and USPS?

In writing, a comma indicates a list, or an extension of what is being written, so it makes more sense to have it as the separator of continued descriptions of money (millions, thousands, hundreds), and the period as the divider of the most trivial part of the money (the end).

But yet what is to stop a perfect copy of bitcoin from starting up, the same sort of mining system... I still think anything that doesn't reference real property (gold standard, oil standard, land ownership, healthcare unit) eventually goes to its core value, zero.

I liken bitcoin to radio spectrum. Just as radio and TV companies buy certain bands of spectrum, owning bitcoin is like owning 1 of the 21M bands of bitcoin spectrum, each of which can be further subdivided (just as the band contains multiple frequencies). The network is like the communications network, and the bitcoins are like the spectrum.
True, utility is the intrinsic value. The packaging is what doesn't matter. If bitcoin can provide the utility of value without the costly packaging of matter (as gold/silver do) then it's the next iteration of money, and appropriately so in this era where we're sitting here typing codes of 1s and 0s to one another that is then reinterpreted on your end to read what I'm typing.

There are always corrections in parabolic growth rates, since the incentive to sell and secure profits increases day by day. However BTC still hardly has anyone who knows about it.
Does anyone know the actual number of unique accounts that hold BTC? I'm wondering what % of humans own any of the existing 11M or so. If it's only like a few hundred thousand owning any, it has the potential to continue going higher, but only so much as others can be convinced of the utility of an intangible currency that is anonymous and untaxable.

Fuck I had this very idea literally hours before first seeing this thread. I thought about how inefficient mere upvoting/downvoting is, and how the quality tends towards cat photos and other bullshit. If instead there were some algorithm whereby users vote up intelligent/logical posts, and the user with a high "post IQ" from the algorithm has higher weight when voting for other posts. THEN, the advertising revenue to the site would be distributed through an algorithm of post IQ and number of posts/page views.

I think the alternative functional uses of money are a backup in the case of disaster, essentially to avoid "musical chairs" disaster scenario, where EMPs destroy much of the "market" for bitcoin currency, and holders of a currency can't find any traders who value their currency. This is why money has converged to precious metals in history, those that are essentially timeless, unchanged through millennia, reliable, existentially trustworthy. However, this is a worst case scenario, so in the meantime I think bitcoin is relatively reliable for trading, but I wouldn't hold significant amounts of them. I do think they will continue to rise in value, but all things equal, I'd prefer to own real estate, and weapons and ammo and tools in evacuated containers in storage.

What's to prevent a new identical bitcoin mining system from developing? If bitcoin's entire value is social, with nothing tangible backing it, the likely scenario is that it goes to zero as well, except for people who will continue using it... however in competition with a digital currency backed by a tangible, I'd prefer the tangible-backing.
