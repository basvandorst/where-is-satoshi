Are you in the US? It might be worth going down to the police station and talking to someone. If this guy has done this to multiple people in your area and some of them have filed reports, the police might be interested in setting up a sting.
Fraud is a crime, the fact that bitcoins are involved doesn't change that. The cops might also say there's nothing they can do, but if they are interested and you change your mind about wanting to help, they can't force you to do anything since you haven't committed a crime. You've got nothing to lose except your bitcoins.

I have a question about electrum.
How secure is that twelve word pass phrase? It seems to me like the kind of thing that ought to be guessable through brute force. After setting up electrum on my pc and going online to figure out how to use it, in one example the 12 word passphrase actually had TWO words in common with mine.
What is the deal here? For all this stuff about cryptography and the crazy passwords I've come up with for every sight that I use, how are 12 words supposed to keep my money safe?

The joke: 8 bits = 1 byte.

Yeah, for that amount of effort it's like you almost might as well just get a...naaahhhhhhh

Stickies + mods directing people to them and deleting repetitive posts.

I think the OP's rant was about new people constantly reinforcing each other's delusion that the price can only go up. This guy was just saying how he personally feels about the money he's risking, and seems to be acknowledging that he might not come out ahead.

Also they're a US based company. When someone in America runs off with a bunch of someone else's money, law enforcement usually gets involved. Doesn't mean they couldn't get away with it, but with the amount of money that Americans have put into this American website, if the owners were to try to run off..., yeah, the FBI isn't gonna turn a blind eye to that. 
The fact that people were buying bitcoin is irrelevant here, it would still be a MASSIVE case of internet fraud, maybe even the biggest in the country's history. Even if law enforcement didn't feel much sympathy toward people buying bitcoin, what they REALLY can not stand is feeling like they suck for letting some flagrant criminals get away from them.
Again, it's definitely not impossible. I am just saying that if that was their plan from the beginning, it was a pretty shitty one.
Attacks on coinbase from third parties though are a completely different story though.

Electrum generates the words for you when you first start it up.
