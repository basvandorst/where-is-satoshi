honestly i have very specific plans and goals if it does get that far, im not anticipating it will otherwise. dont matter, regardless of price its as far as i can see, a good long-term value store.
Hell, its even small things. At any point you wanted to check your bitcoin balance, have you ever been met with maintenance messages, outages due to ddos, or anything that comes with checking your balance on a site? not a problem with bitcoin.

westeren union to be completely honest. Bitcoin requires too much for it to be used as a way to exchange money internationally, or even nationally, to someone who is not  computer savy.
@_date: 2014-02-11 02:44:37
absolutely none, some people -might- get their btc out, but i think the majority of people are absolutely fucked. gox basically hasn't integrated a reliable way to track transactions, so they have no idea how to tell who has what anymore, but they do know they are losing massive amounts of coins to people exploiting this weakness in their system, so the chances that gox right now has enough bitcoin to cover everyone is very, very slim.
i would assume a loss until further notice. not only has the transaction malleability issue been known, its been bought to gox's attention on several occasions and they have either claimed to been resilient to it, or brushed it off entirely. at this point, it really is starting to appear that gox is just trying to save face and blame the protocool instead of their own shortcomings because they flat out cannot admit the btc they had is gone.

more than likely gpu brute forcing with some starting parameters like "the pass is at least 6 chars long, so lets start there" to mitigate time. i used to do the same with rar files for people. basically the more details on what the pass could be really helps narrow it down, but it still may take some decent amount of time.

thats the problem with it, people are in it for the short term pump and dump. im not interested in earning thousands of dollars off of a cryptocoin. i seem to be in the minority that want's to see cryptocoin successful in the distant future. i am not intested in &lt;meme coin/celeb coin&gt; and think that these joke coins are more damaging to cryptocoin as a whole than they are helpful. people should not be viewing cryptocoins as a child's game when it has the potential for real economic impact.
@_date: 2014-02-12 03:43:59
sadly this is probably not the case. the reason is [making an altcoin]( isnt that hard if you know how to follow a guide. that's basically how the majority, if not all, altcoin's are made.
while i dont understand the code, im sure if i sunk a good solid hour into following that guide i could crank out a coin of my own. unless the people making the altcoin apply the proper patches to their forked client, the transaction malleability issue could happen.

gpu's and fpga's can mine scrypt, sadly sha256 and nonce would limit current asic's to that specification only, and there is not too many alt coins that use those, at least that arent much more profitable than bitcoin.
outside of that, nope...not a chance. the reason they are application specific is because the asic chip itself is...best way i can put this....hardware programmed, aka designed custom tailored to one job, which is why it does it very..very well. fpga's are as they imply, fully programmable but much slower.
i would suggest you read this wikipedia article.
there is a reason they are called ASIC. there is no innovation here, they are literally designed for one thing, and once designed that way cannot be changed. its physically not possible, because an asic is not running software.
edit: personally, once my asic dies, i'll probably mount it in a nice frame and give it some cool lighting effects or something. to me, its a marvel of how far bitcoin has come, and how far it still has to go. when i bought it, the ghash it could pull was unthinkable. now, its a needle in space, but the thing still blows my mind.

Wow, im surprised. I don't think its gonna end well for him, and obviously we don't know what his lawyers said, but the only two scenarios are
lawyers told him to plea guilty because there is no chance of winning and he went against what the lawyers said, which means they are now preparing to fight a losing battle, or mitigate damage to hopefully lessen the sentence
or, the lawyers told him to plea not guilty because they are absolutely confident the case is winnable. they have more evidence than we do, so that could be likely, although i dont see it being probable.
@_date: 2014-04-06 03:36:06
oh that can be done, but you would have to buy the hardware to do it, which isn't money you'll get back. i turned my asic off a month ago. probably going to put it in a nice little display case or something.

its not new, blockchain is actually down for maintenance
they also use cloudflare for dns management (hopefully not for DDoS mitigation because cloudflare isnt good at that)
cloudflare basically acts as sort of a proxy, so when a site is offline, in maintenance mode, unreachable, or under attack it may do a few things, this being one of them.
in one of cloudflares efforts to mitigate a ddos attack (again, they aren't good at this, but that's a subject for another time) they will fingerprint the end users browser to try and separate it from bot traffic. this does work to some degree.

again, that is not a good enough reason. Who are you? there is no indication of this anywhere. What have you done in the community to benefit the community? are your claims verifiable? why isn't your code open source and ready for peer review?
if anyone is going to use an open wallet, they would use blockchain. even if you are legit, its absolutely clear you are not using the same security practices they use, and unlike blockchain, we cannot review your websites code.
you are entirely the exact opposite of what bitcoin should be. having an online wallet with you would be no different that opening up a bank account with fiat.
I don't want features, and the way you are tossing those around is a huge red flag to me that you don't have any real idea what you are doing in regards to this.

in its current state? no probably not but its good for now. however, it can be changed a great deal without forking the block chain if needed, as i understand...that's assuming all the clients (aka people like you and me) agree and update bitcoind to accept said changes.
@_date: 2014-02-14 12:28:10
agreed. i can only speculate as to how the need for bitcoin will come, or whatever crypto takes it place should it fall, but i agree entirely. the volatility issue although right now might go against what im about to say, i see it slowly being more stable with every huge downturn (and the eventual upturn) it seems that once we stabilize out from these sorts of events as we have witnessed this week, the price goes up and down a little, but overall seems to stay put for longer periods of time.
My biggest fear is that with major retailers such as overstock and TD choosing bitcoin, we all know their goal (in order to mitigate volatility) is to get rid of the coin as soon as possible, which is reasonable. The problem is, when exchanges stop their service, these guys can't get rid of their coin and that's bad. they start taking huge financial tolls and eventually will have to pull out because its just not stable enough. There are two solutions to this problem, one of course is an exchanger that does not have to stop exchanging because of a bug (or be prepared for it ahead of time) and is immune to attacks like a DDoS, or bitcoin has to be less volatile. Without either of those, im not sure i see retailers sticking in the long term until its resolved.
So, i guess the take away is before we have an easy to use service as i mentioned previously, im thinking we really, REALLY need to focus all our efforts on a decentralized exchange, for a number of reasons, but the biggest i think would be major retailer adoption. a distributed exchange offers so many benefits, the most obvious of which would be surviving a DDoS attack, and never having to go offline. that, as it seems right now, is the biggest factor in bitcoin volatility.
thanks for the excellent discussion, by the way. right now that sort of thing is rare and i have actually unsubbed from this subreddit until things die down a bit. getting too trolly for my tastes.

yea, most porn sites have a parent company that pushes the content. that parent company allows you to have videos, tgp galleries, etc. because most parent companies often have a varity of niche websites, if you go to 3 or 4 places and sign up to do affiliate marketing for them, combine all their stuff and mix it up into your own website, it often goes completely unnoticed to the end user.
basically all ponhub has to do once they get all the content (which takes like...20-30 minutes?) is integrate it, add whatever extra features they want, and dump shitloads of cash into advertising.
also, porn is really easy to market. that seems like an obvious statement, but if you are going to get into the porn marketing biz, don't over advertise too early on a limited budget, you'll sink. too much traffic and not enough server umph to keep up kills alot of sites.
@_date: 2014-02-14 10:51:00
i think my statement still stands. while thats progress in a positive direction, its not what i have in mind. for starters, i don't live in the UK. i also don't think having to commute to exchange cash/debit/credit -&gt; bitcoin is a great solution. commute = time = clunky.
Fast, instant. like buying something online. "i want x bitcoins, here is my wallet and payment info" process and done.
again, its def progress, but its not global at least yet and it still does not solve the factor of time.  for the current community this is doable without a doubt, but its easy to forget about how the average person thinks about technology, and that creates a huge gap in communication. we are no longer building a community, we are building a financial system. ease of use is critical to its success in the average person's adoption of the technology.

just from a security standpoint, do you have any checks to prevent csrf? if thats possible, im seeing a really easy way to jack payments from ya, since you are letting the client handle where the payment goes.
edit: payment system bypassed. its fairly easy with using the developer console to change this line in your checkstatus() function:
if(parseInt(data['custom']) == 1) {
if(parseInt(data['custom']) == 0) {
seriously, never trust the client. either you dont currently have HD videos, or there is some cookie shennanigans going on too. either way, from there it makes the payment system pretty pointless :p

Scrapping an old codebase - even a solid one - is not uncommon in the development industry, hell in my experience ive seen more good code get scraped to only be replaced by terrible, cheaper developed code. the development industry as a whole is in a sad state of affairs but that's another rant for another time. its generally not always the brightest idea, but the fact is mark decided to develop a new engine with absolutely no experience or regard to the security of it. whatever was used in the past is not relevant to the current situation. we can speculate all we want on if the old codebase was good or bad, but that won't get anyone anywhere and most certiantly wont validate or invalidate the integrity of mtgox's previous owner.

@_date: 2014-02-14 10:56:57
this is a good point to bring up. I am a developer, i could run through my list of credentials and cite security practices all day long, but this is **not** something you want to fly solo on in any situation. throw pen test after pen test after it, set bounties, have peer reviewed code if you can, and once you have determined its secure, do it again. its scary that often times, when it comes to development budgets those also encompass security within the budget. i think having a dev and security budget separate is a good idea. being a developer and having been on a budget, you eventually hit that wall where a feature has to be cut because of time, or this bug goes unchecked, or that. often, security is the first thing to get skimped on.
being a developer is one thing, being a security focused developer is another level entirely, and one that isn't always easily done. the tl/dr of this is: don't do things solo, ask for help when you need it and make sure you have a solid budget in place for all of it. things WILL go wrong in development, plan for it.

haha i dunno, maybe retirement if it ever becomes that valuable. my initial investment wasn't all that much, so im thinking long term (6+ years). it could crash and burn, it could be stupidly valuable, or about the same as its been this year. anyone's guess, but the way i see it is i don't see too many people thinking long term. ive seen bitcoin bubbles come and go, and not once have i panic sold/bought. ive seen the overall value of my coin drop and rise by hundreds of dollars in a day, the current price because of mtgox's lies aren't anything that really disturbs me. if i was in it for purely profit, i knew when it was over 1k it was not sustainable and could have sold then, but didn't. 
maybe im one of the rare few who truely believes in bitcoins future, but i think that's a pompous stance to take, so i think it just boils down to curiosity.

interesting you bring that up, here is a thread on the mtgox issue dated...*drumroll* feb-3-2014.
edit: just to be clear, i don't know of any public record of their bylaws, which is a little concerning, but considering the presented evidence, i suspect the outcome is clear. Gavin Andresen is a board member, has publicly stated mtgox is wrong. i think if anyone on the board didn't vote mark out, trust in bitcoin would be lost as a whole, so really...i don't see any other options.

exactly. under that same notion the money that is in my bank, represented by nothing but data, should fall under the same argument. it can be exchanged for physical us currency, but so can bitcoin.
The only difference with fiat in a digital society is fiat is not protected by algorithms and the point of authority at which the currency exists is singular at any given time. so honestly, either money in my bank should not be able to be seized, or bitcoins should be able to be seized, but there is no way we can have both.

you have to admit though, it would be awesome if we could decorate each bitcoin with glitter text
@_date: 2014-02-04 05:51:34
if current trend of adoption is any indication, i expect it to actually go down. compare when overstock announced it and people started buying, price went down. same with TD's announcement. price went down. As more major companies adopt, i expect this trend to continue because it gives people a reason to not just sit on their coins, and these companies do not sit on any bitcoins they earn through sales either, they auto exchange through places like coinbase or bitpay. that auto exchange rate is always just a hair below what bitcoin is at for USD, so when you sell off a large amount of coins, it constantly drops.
and that's a good thing. bitcoin does not need a high value, it just has to be useful.
@_date: 2014-01-22 04:31:53
in theory yes, but its not financially feasible, which is why the crazy increasing rate in difficulty is a good thing, it helps make that less feasible over time. im an advocate for running a miner, even if its a little usb stick 300 mhash miner, however if its mining for profit you are after, i'll deter you from that since its generally not profitable anymore. but if you want to help the network i say go for it.
that said, a fact that seems to go missed - espically with mining pools - is not only does a certian group (say slush's pool for example) have to control 51% to do double spend attacks, but everyone in that pool would have to agree to do it, so even if the government took control of a pool, its still a slim chance, which means they would have to buy all the hardware and do it themselves, which is ludicrously expensive.
if im wrong, i would love to be corrected, but that is my understanding

@_date: 2014-02-14 09:01:03
one that simply isn't possible. there needs to be a way for someone with a debit card to just buy bitcoins. sadly, because of the nature of debit/credit cards and the nature of bitcoins, it won't happen. i fear this will be regular user adoption's biggest wall.
The problem is you could develop a website, use some payment processor system like stripe's api, but the potential for fraud is still huge.
We have things like coinbase which mitigates this through verification processes, but those processes take entirely too long. unless it can be bought like anything else within 5-10 minutes, i personally consider it clunky.
more realistically, we just need services..not tools. actual products. there are tons of things you can buy with bitcoin now, but diversity is always good.
also, maybe a decentralized exchanger...that seems to get bought up often and i understand there are some projects in regards to this, but its a little difficult, so find one of those and contribute to it.

holy shit you are seriously retarded. anyone can ddos an exchange any time of the day, assuming you have a botnet (or, more preferable a dns amplification botnet) large enough. bitcoin does not have to be entered into this equation at all. its the websites responsibility to mitigate such an attack, this is true for any site anywhere. it is not the web host, ISP, or some 3rd party software's development team's responsibility.

wrong, the price has nothing to do with it. bitcoin could be disconnected entirely from fiat value and banks would not like it.
they don't like bitcoin because the nature of bitcoin makes them not relevant anymore. bitcoin is to banks what the internet is to paper newspapers. While newspapers still exist, they are mostly not relevant and have been replaced by a better technology. not being relevant = revenue loss, and no business, from a mom and pop grocery store to a fortune 500 company, likes revenue loss.

- BFL releases product, they have a proven history with this

as far as details go, they may not be able to give many details, depending on what their legal department says. handling it the wrong way could spell disaster, so not giving out any info might lose some small time customers, but nothing near as catastrophic as giving out details about things they shouldn't.
should they? i would like to see it, but its just not a straight foward decision.

GPG is not dead, not by a long shot. The stock exchange itself might be secure, but the other sites hosted on the same domain on the same server i have my doubts about. The domain is falsely registered, and the owner of the domain (and PR guy/girl) of this stock exchange has made quite a reputation as a spammer. as far as im concerned, this sort of person is not what we need in the community.
Not to mention they have made zero efforts to improve every single time these things have been bought up. simply put, i highly doubt they care about the bitcoin community, they seem to be in it for a quick buck after several failed attempts at their previous internet marketing scams.

this is painfully convoluted, the site is terrible, and its hosted off a domain that belongs to a site with other projects that could potentially be a security risk.
I think not. too many attack vectors, this has clearly not been thought through.

i have been considering creating a service like this, actually. Really, the only way one could accomplish this is the registrar (me) owns the domain, and rents it out to the end user, you.
I would probably still ask for some personal info like address, etc, but the whois data would be my po box address, name, etc. 
The reason i would still ask for your info is just in case your domain gets jacked and you need to verify it. Really that's the only way i could see doing this sort of service, unless anyone has any suggestions.
@_date: 2012-06-14 19:24:38
yeah, but you will want to plan ahead of time, as i understand it, BFL still has a massive backorder so you'll be waiting a few weeks to receive yours. the very large scale miners are switching over to BFL units, which is putting a damper on gpu mining rigs.

you can use the address public, but DONT use a public wallet. download the client, generate a wallet, use a good password that you can remember, and store that wallet offline, away from a network.
if you want to see donations going to that wallet, just use blockchain to look it up. the only time you should need to use the wallet directly is to send bitcoins from the wallet to another person or mtgox to cash out.

Without much programming i would say its not very feasable, but the best way to learn a language is dive in neck deep.
That said, i have lightly looked into arbitrage, and i am NOT a financial guru or a market guru.
The biggest issue i see between different exchanges isn't speed. they are usually pretty quick. the biggest issue i see is exchange fee's. Arbitrage is there, you can easily see that. but you need to calculate fees into that, which severely limits opportunity most of the time.
Most of the bots that i see will sit on one exchange and play with price differences, or cacluate potential risk/benifits to move between btc and usd for maximum profitability.
in theory you would think buy low, sell high would work..but obviously if that worked normal stock exchanges wouldn't be so damn complicated :p
Right now, its a huge risk to do any of this because there is obviously not any projection models on the scale of say, NASDAQ
i would say by all means, go for it. nothing is proven without actually trying it. i just think by the time exchange fees are calculated, you won't be making very much if anything at all. Its a young, volatile market. the risk is huge, but so is the reward.

I wouldn't mind, my biggest problem with the namecoin project is for others to see your namecoin domain, you have to either a.) use the namecoin client, b.) directly use the namecoin dns servers, or c.) use a proxy.
that's a nogo for the general public. so, although namecoin would be nice, it would probably latch into the current dns network. more than anything, it would provided dns redundancy.
but that is an absolutely insanely massive jump. the end goal is to have a vps like hosting solution that's p2p, we are very far away from that :P
@_date: 2012-10-05 09:56:43
My question is do you have ANY experience with web hosting, and more specifically vps web hosting? if not, learn on your own box. ask for some tips, then once you feel confident, go ahead and spin up a service.
Yes. you have competition. but competition - especially in bitcoin - is GOOD. it forces people to be innovative, which is exactly what bitcoin needs, more innovation.
As a wallet solution like you suggested earlier - i personally wouldn't trust my wallet remotely. if its not in my network, i do not trust it, nothing against you..just basic security practice.
there is a ton of things to think of, so please plan this out and do it right if you are going to do anything. I would love to see more vps providers.

On the subject of decentralized, a buddy and i drummed up an idea for a completely decentralized hosting solution, however basically our only developer has kind of dropped the project due to...threats from an influential entity.
it would be awesome to see a team take over the project. i only helped come up with the initial idea, so i don't know about much of the code that runs it. if you are interested, check out 
the guy you will want to contact over it is Steven, or me, although steven would be better.
The basic idea is simple: decentralize web hosting using p2p nodes. its insane and we have a proof of concept, although would not mind being able to expand its ability to do things like hosting dynamic sites and DNS.
its a massive undertaking, but i believe strongly that it belongs in the bitcoin community in specific. With this, you could easily run a decentralized bitcoin exchange system.
Ya don't even have to use this project, i just want to see this become a reality, i don't care who does it or who gets credit.

tor is slow. tor also requires you to use a proxy, the torbrowser, or something to see tor websites. this is not that. you'll be able to surf a website hosted on this network and see it like you see any other website. nothing on the end user changes.
this is also not used for surfing the web anonymously. the only encryption that (currently) goes on are files being signed and encrypted to the network. that is to prevent tampering, although i am not entirely sure how that works.
@_date: 2011-07-24 04:45:52
You did not get the point. why would you post a picture of nothing but the blurred out sdram and not the asic board itself with the vitals blurred out. Once again, you have provided **zero** proof that your product even exists. i can blur out a pic of sdram and claim its part of an asic board too. its just ram. of course the ram is vital. but once again, that does not mean your product you are advertising exists. That's like me taking a picture of a tire that goes on a car and telling people it belongs to my BMW that i want to sell without providing evidence that i actually have a BMW to sell, then saying "it obviously exists because the tire is vital for the car to move!"
@_date: 2011-06-19 23:08:47
that is actually a great idea
@_date: 2011-06-19 15:40:11
People, such as myself, actually have no other way to pay for things on the internet. Monetary value on the internet to me is completely useless. That's where bitcoin steps in. Yes, the market volatility is high, but an automated price adjustment system based on mtgox/tradehill prices would not be hard to make. As far as actually getting paid in bitcoin, yes - you'll get paid and you'll likely see the market drop or go higher. From what i have seen it tends to even out at around 16-17 dollars, but don't hold me to it. Just keep in mind that if your coin has a low value one day, just wait it out a couple days - it will pick up.
@_date: 2011-06-18 16:43:38
fuck i hate sites that use https for EVERYTHING
edit: im trying it out now anyways
@_date: 2011-06-18 23:04:38
obviously you did not see my [link showing bypassing https is quite easy](
. Newsflash, tons of malware integrates these methods to bypass ssl. 
https is only responsible for the transfer of data between you and the server. What happens once the data data reach the server is not covered by https. So if someone hacks the server, and gains access to its database your data may still be lost. But wait, there is more. Not only can https be bypassed anyways, but the encryption has been long broken, since 2008. So, once again, if someone wants your mtgox account, or an account on any site, https is not going to protect you from it. https is not going to protect you from malware bypassing it, and https is not going to keep your packets encrypted when its just as easy to decrypt those packets. Keep in mind this is a specification from 1996. its old, outdated and broken compared to moderen standards. So yes, https is just about as secure as http.
@_date: 2011-10-07 21:54:50
it probally wont be zero, but it'll be close.
@_date: 2011-06-23 17:58:15
this is actually a really good explanation. Before the mtgox thing, i was somehow unaware that salts are used to make rainbow tables ineffective. The biggest problem is that most of even the salted keys was gpu cracked with ease, so i assume the triple salting is used to put a halt to that as well. Also, i must ask, under say, a high registration load, wouldn't that for loop be fairly slow? is there any way to optimize that? i understand the sha512 encryption itself is designed to be slow, so the slowness of that * 10000 iterations would be kind of a crawl right? but then again, id rather have slow signups as opposed to insecure

Bitcoin client can do mining, although its useless since its CPU based and not GPU based.
I basically would not reccomend you mine. You would have to have quite a bit of power, even in pooled mining, to even make a profitable dent. However, if your looking to just help the network, look into GPU mining on bitcointalk.org - the easiest client to use is called guiminer.
Once you do that, and sign up to a pool of your choosing, you'll be mining in no time. The bitcoin client only serves as a way to send/recieve bitcoins, thats about it.

Yup, i think if anything, a side benefit of bit-coins will be that it is a showcase of how little we are actually secure with any financial transaction. I personally am not a security consultant, but without saying much, i can say there are several major payment processors accepting a particular form of payment, and within that particular form of payment lies several major design flaws. these are fatal flaws. I have even contacted the companies and gave them a full disclosure. that was back in 2007, the flaws still exist.
its just amazing, absolutely amazing, how little security really exists, and even more staggering is the fact we trust banks, credit card companies, and other financial institutions that get hacked daily.
Hopefully, if anything, bitcoin can shed light on these issues. As you said, there is nothing wrong with bitcoin itself. 
On a side note, you should look into how many bitcoin sites end up using javascript libraries like jquery for things that should always be back-end stuff.

 is a great little resource. take note of the command line switches, try em out and see what works for you :)
other than that to figure out my potential profit, i use 
i don't think its too late to mine for a new rig, but once again i am no market expert.
buy coins when its low, mine and sell when its high :)
anyways, i hope i was a little help. sorry if i wasn't, and good luck on your ventures

How does this effect people doing pooled mining? does the difficulty rates effect solo more so?
@_date: 2011-06-19 23:03:51
well you can have a static salt, a very very long string thats hard coded into the authentication system itself (thats what i do anyways) so it md5's the password and that salt, the resulting md5 string gets stored in the database. That way, if they get the db, they do NOT have the salt key, unless they have the source code to the auth system as well.

oh yea? Link me to the datasheet of the sha core you are using.
also the " Pilchard FPGA design" is an entire fpga that plugs into a dimm slot, but from what i am reading, does not have any memory on it. It relies on the desktop to boot, then it tricks the desktop into bypassing the memory chip for the slot the fpga resides in.
The point i am making here is there is no way your fitting the fpga, plus the sdram, plus the sha core on one little board. it really does not matter what you say, It can be the fpga or it can be ram for the fpga, but it is not both. And is it ASIC or FPGA because you seem to change your story on that quite a bit as well.

most retarted statement of the year award goes to that guy. its not even remotely close to being the possible end to bitcoin. it was ONE exchange that had a problem, may other exchange exist, and many people switched to a different exchange. if anything, its the fall of an exchange and a rise of a possibly better exchange. but its not the end of bitcoin.

True, but they never used a secret salt either, and (as far as i know) their authentication source code itself wasn't in any danger, just the database - which could be on a separate machine altogether. I do understand now that a unique salt can slow down brute forcing attempts, but i don't think it accounts for gpu based brute forcing - i am not certian on that.
@_date: 2011-09-20 19:05:30

i agree idiot level ways are needed, but the point is its a work in progress, and the bitcoin community as well as the bitcoin client developers are well aware of this situation. if its not user friendly enough yet for some people, the simple solution is don't use it, but don't blame the product because you cant understand it.

You might want to print_r($re) and check it out, it may have changed (somehow...although im not sure how) what you will be looking for with line8 in that particular array is everything from the first $ sign to the last $ sign, which is the salt. so if the md5 was $1$zTCuDYhf$mAf/H0U.2I3jhef1o5AN/. the salt would be $1$zTCuDYhf$
edit: i would work on a cli version but i have ran out of time for the night, got clients to meet tomorrow. If i see that mtgox is not up, which would eliminate the need for the php script, when i get home tomorrow i will quickly modify a cli version (i love php cli, used it for a youtube channel downloading script i made) and link it here in another edit, i'll let you know. if you manage to get it working then feel free to post the code :)

True. I guess its not a big deal for me because im not using vpn's like mullvad for explicit illegal things. 200 kb/s for me is way too slow, not to mention dropped packets like crazy. its not impossible, i wasn't trying to argue that. i probally wouldn't trust a hacked server either, since logs can still be harvested.

i knew that comment was coming. If you dont trust it, then there is no reason to use it, but the source code is there. Also look at my comment history, ive done nothing all day but explain to people about how the database is encrypted, how it can be decrypted, etc. This tool is temporary and won't be needed when mtgox comes back online, but for people, like me, that couldn't remember what password they used with mtgox, this tool helps alot and saves a ton of time changing every password to everything.

@_date: 2011-08-19 05:57:49
yea i ended up buying some time with mullvad vpn. the ONLY problem i have had so far is getting apache to work through the vpn but it was a firewall setting on my end. i did have it installed as a system service on windows but ran into some issues - but its not supported so no big deal.
i would have preferred to use openvpn with mullvad configs but it does seem to run slower, i didnt give it much testing and i actually like the lightweight footprint of the mullvad client.
my ONLY complaint is i have to disable it to use hulu and netflix, i would prefer to keep it enabled. It has somthing to do with setting up my routes in windows using the routes command (i assume) but i have no idea what to do there.
i have yet to game on it, i notice latency can be a bit higher which may be a problem for gamming, but i can just disable it if i want to fire up the occasional game
So far, though, everythings been pretty awesome.

Thats not bad, i personally think the case is a bit rediclious, but to each their own. even with that guy's setup, he is only making about 91 bucks a month currently, and thats not including how much it costs to run the thing.
really, to get started turning a profit with bitcoin mining, you need a decent chunk of money to start with. Back when the getting was good, i calculated that you would need an 8 rig minimum with high end gpu's to make good profits. but it doesn't stop there, difficulty goes up? you'll have to buy more rigs to compensate. price drops? you'll lose your ass in costs.
Its more of a gamble, and from what i have seen, the majority of people that have hobby mined have eventually lost their ass and sold their rigs to try and recoup at least a little of their costs.

I assume that article talks about a physical business accepting bitcoins, in which case, anonymous transactions would be somewhat pointless.
Without exposing too much, if it gets to the point a site asks for your social security number to "verify" you, NONE of the social security verification systems (largely popular with pay porn sites) work. That's right, NONE. which means it can be faked. if your on a site now and not using a proxy to do your transactions with bitcoins, well...your not concerned about being anonymous.

I actually use BTC for web hosting and vpn's. Also use it to get paid for services i do online, since paypal is not an option for me. I generally follow the btc-&gt;usd price, but it's been rare i have actually exchanged btc-&gt;usd, i use it more often to buy other services within the bitcoin community. i do buy usd-&gt;btc, though..but i don't get upset when the price drops. last batch of btc i bought was at 6 dollars a coin, and i just recently spent that on web hosting, i don't really see it as "fuck, i lost 14 bucks for a service that normally costs 5 bucks".
I think as it stands right now, btc is at the price it should be. the price/difficulty/market of the bitcoin system really has a neat way of keeping each other from getting too out of control for too long, i think.
@_date: 2011-05-23 02:45:48
actually, you wouldn't even need to do any registration. i think you can use block explorer to see if a bitcoin address exists.
for example, using bitcoin.cz's donation address, you can type
and everything shows up like it should. if you are one off, like 
it will fail. you can make a php script in very few lines of code to handle automating the process of verifying an address.

@_date: 2011-06-19 22:46:43
uh, generally not a good idea to not only store the salt in the database, usually you would do somthing like md5("$password.$salt") or using the crypt function, crypt($password, $salt); then store the salt key outside of the database. what they did, however, was just run crypt($password); which will spit out a random md5 string and a salt. Because its random, it has to be stored in a database, which is ill-advised, since you can figure out the salt key from the string, so the md5 hash $1$JH7whsJL$CYB0DbRVZkQ4LzUa4yWa1/ would be salted with $1$JH7whsJL$
Basically, the salts, used in this manner, provide zero security.

not that it matters, since their pool seems to be non-functioning
@_date: 2011-06-19 21:25:13
Looking at the evidence, i think its just default crypt() with a custom salt, by default crypt will use md5();
also looking at the evidence presented, its a good possibility that figuring out the salt is quite easy. If they lacked security to prevent a simple mysql xss db dump, then some of the passwords are unsalted md5, while others very obviously use the crypt() function with md5, then i imagine the salt is not hard to figure out.
Also, my theory is they are using md5() as a fallback function if crypt() for whatever reason, fails. it is not related to simple passwords being md5() and complex ones being crypt(), or visa versa. This explains why even near the end of the file, you still see regular md5 hash's. My password, was easy, and was encrypted with crypt(), but some passwords - so far 8 char's in length - are actually kind of complex but still crackable; and they are regular md5's. i may work on trying to brute force the salt, since i know what my password was in the time that db was captured
@_date: 2011-06-30 23:21:02
i don't think this is mtgox. the account i had with an easy password is not listed in there at all
edit: it was in the original db dump, fyi.

I doubt bitcoin will ever be a threat to the us dollar, so i don't think governments would go this far to put it out of business. with that said, there is now malware out in the wild that effects some system bios's and introduces operating system agnostic malware, so governments wouldn't even need to spend money on buying up processors, they would only need to produce some good malware to infect bios's. A virus scanner could detect it, but it would be very, very difficult to remove, since the virus scanner would have to be completely error proof in its removal process or it could kill the machine completely. scary stuff, and although i don't agree with your hypothetical situation, i do agree its very possible and should be discussed anyways.

it doesn't really work that way, and by doing that mtgox could be held legally responsible. What i do know, however, is it was bound to happen. Regardless of how, who, what where or why, it happens. Put down your pitchfork and molotov's because although this is (currently) a messy situation, i personally have learned several do's and don't lessons, and so has mtgox. Reguardless of how it happened, how mtgox says it happened, mtgox is well aware of what they need to do to prevent whatever security hole it may have been.

i estimated the total cost of my two rigs to be a little over 3 grand, and at current market/hashrate difficulty it would take almost 2 months to pay off.
keep in mind that even at a $20k farm, you are going to want some serious cooling solutions, i wouldnt bother with watercooling on a large scale op like that - it might require too much maintenance.

those aren't the target users anyways. the user base you would be looking at would be what any malware developer goes for: the average joe. working in computer repair has taught me one thing: the majority of people that go on the internet with their computers barely know how to keep it secure, do not care, cant determine when a process is using more cpu than it should, and above all: have a really, really difficult time realizing that something is spyware and is not helping their system (antivirus 2010 is a great example of this tomfoolery)
on average, most of these computers will deal with their computer slowing down until it either a.) becomes unusable and crashy or b.) they think its because they need a new computer.
that is the target audience for such a thing as this, and the ability to distribute and have it self propigate over p2p and go under the radar is easy and absolutely scary.

i wouldn't trust them. Personally i have been toying with the idea of an wallet.dat storage service, but using client side encryption using javascript when the file is being uploaded. it would give users a peace of mind knowing their stuff is being encrypted before it hits the server, and i would open source the entire system on git so people would know their key is not stored in any database. only hold back is im not sure it would be well received. Honestly, at the end of the day the only person you can trust with your 'coins is yourself.
@_date: 2011-07-01 22:16:35
Actually, people (in my experience) are fairly willing to give you a shot at trusting them. I have sold several things on bitmarket with people that have no reason to trust me, but did anyways. I think there is a bitcoin web of trust thing, you'll have to google about it
@_date: 2011-05-24 04:44:55
another edit: also a botnet in the normal sense would not be neccicary. you could set up a private pool on a vps with misleading info easy (malware developers do this all the time)
all you need is for a computer to connect and do some hash work, unless you want more control over the computer. the computers dont need to communicate with each other, or know of the existance of one or another. even if they are only on for 5 minutes, with enough computers connected you'll end up having a high hash rate, and constant hashing. i would find it very hard for the network to drop below 50 ghash/sec if it was done right, which would require very little effort

well a regular md5 hash looks like 61ec4d4e00dfb3f72184e0f906d4f25d
i have confirmed this is not even salted because i have cracked several in that format already. The hashes that look like $1$O1xhAjsI$1AfRor5btTWXGEugNBI2L/ are salted.
basically for the non salted hashes, php's md5(); was used. for the salted hashes php's crypt(); was used with a custom salt and md5 as a default algorithm.
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:19:52


Ok.. Not good. The salts are listed right there in the database. Your salt is listed right after the $1$
To test this out, if you have a webserver running php 5 or above, make this in to a .php file and substitute your salt and password
$pass = crypt('password', '$1$salt$');
echo $pass;
This will echo back the md5 hash of your password+salt and it will match that in the database. If you know the hash, and you know the salt, and you have the computing power (bitcoin miner), you can crack any 8 or less character password in a couple days max.

yea, salted will most likely be fine for now, but if the salt security reflects the plain md5's in the db and the fact the db was not protected, i would imagine brute forcing their salt would prove to be quite easy.

true, and true. But if you forget your password to something that important, then maybe you shouldn't be on a computer. Trojans can read the contents from ram, but not everyone runs the bitcoin client 24/7 so if they get compromised, they have a much better chance of scanning and removing the trojan before running the bitcoin client. without encryption, the trojan can just jank the wallet file and thats it.
Hell, if you wanted to really lock the wallet.dat file down, the bitcoin client could easily use hardware id's that are hard to spoof to make the wallet useless on another machine.

21 mil coins is an artifical cap. Bitcoin is a baby currency and it will take many years for it to make progress into general society. The next client update will have native wallet.dat encryption. As with all data, its still important to back up..most people dont because they do not understand the risks of data loss. Give bitcoin time, stick with it and help it mature instead of instilling doubt in others. if you want to see the currency take off, help it. i dont imagine you want to see it fail or you would not be here.

[For starters]( being lazy and using HTTPS is not a solution. These attacks CAN be prevented. Also, you are right, malware can inject stuff into a browser. if thats the case, then it is not a problem for the site owner, its the user's machine, and its the user's responsibility to take care of that. HTTPS [has its own major flaws]( so it is not an end-all solution, and no, https wont prevent malware from doing nasty things. But we are not talking about client side security. we are talking about server side security, and csrf is server side and is preventable without using the https overhead. Login forums should be https, but sites need to use it where it is essential.

true, yea i probally wont do the wallet hosting. Even if people trust me, there is always a risk of a 0 day exploit that could put me under in a heartbeat. The idea behind the colocation is get popular enough where i can offer the service cheap enough where miners wouldn't feel the need to flea. Not only could they do mining, but if they really wanted to, because of the nature of the network design, they could use their box as a dedicated web server, or whatever else they want.
But you are right, there is no need to re invent the wheel and tack on bitcoins to it.
I have thought of maybe an exchange service like tradehill, mtgox, or ruxum but i kinda feel like there are enough of those.
maybe a browser based game where people could load their account with however many bitcoins they want and duel other players for bitcoins, that would be pretty cool i think.

bitcoin is fairly unique. The government can try to stop it, but much like music sharing programs (napster, kazaa) another system will take its place. Currently, there is no law prohibiting the creation of alternative currencies and no law  preventing the use of it. doing so, in my opinion, would do great damage to the economy and stock markets. would the government try to stop it? hell yes. can it be stopped? even if its illegal to use bitcoins as a currency, who the hell will they go after? its not hard to transfer bitcoin to us dollar, or any currency for that matter.
yes, there are barriers to overcome, legal battles to get into. bitcoin is very much an infant and has alot of progress to make. It appears to me, unlike other digital currencies - and alternitive currencies in general - that bitcoin has the foundations for a successful outcome. it has a strong userbase who completely supports the idea of bitcoin. that alone, is not enough...but its a damn good start.

Very smooth design. I am also interested in performance. like, the bitcoin client seems to take a bit to load, and that only increases over time as the network grows. Sending a payment brings the program to a near hault for a short time. Are these issues you are able to address and solve with your client?

your a huge idiot if you use off the shelf av, norton barely works as a consumer product, at best. Second, the next update, if you follow github, will have wallet encryption. third, everyone was warned to change their passwords when mtgox got hacked. Sony got hacked, did you change those passwords too? are you going to stop using sony products? i doubt it. Third, if you are using the same passwords for everything in the first place, well, its pretty common knowlege that its bad practice to do that. Bitcoin is not ready for mainstream, and likely wont be for some time, but you cant expect any currency to instantly become mainstream. the US dollar even had to be worked on and improved a great deal. If you dont want to use bitcoin, thats fine. But dont blame Bitcoin for your own idiocy

Yes, if gold was a primary currency, then inflation would still be possible, it isn't hard, espically when most of our currency is purely digital anyways. but instead of saying "THAT WONT WORK BECAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM" then we should ask how do we solve it.
well, i would say this is where bitcoins shine.

i am not sure about the eligibility to work in japan as an American citizen, to my understanding i can apply for a work visa, but i am not entirely clear on how that works. Edit: yea the downtime will be great. Do you guys have an environment set up that mirrors the live environment for development testing? its quite handy to have.

yea i just had to edit my post. the friend i was hosting with said he didnt want issues because of people complaining to his server host claiming we are stealing passwords. The easiest way is to setup xmpp on windows, start the apache server, download the drop box link provided in my edit, and copy that to your xmpp htdocs directory, then in your browser go to  or wherever the directory is.
edit: you can also do wamp, idk much about wamp. Sorry its not any easier than that, php is all i know and im afraid if it was a .exe file people would claim the same thing. lose-lose situation

maybe, but mullvad is in sweden. HMA - even though they have ip's all over the world - are based in the united states, so they must obey united states law. Mullvad, on the other hand, is not obligated to do that. In sweden, it doesn't exactly work the same way, the provider is responsible for network activities, not the end user. They don't go after the end user, which is why its pointless to give up ip's in sweden. Its up to the provider to put a stop to malicious activity.
with that said, tor is another layer you can use, but its very slow.
Your best bet is to find a vpn provider, that do not need much info and are based in countries with anonymity laws that do protect the end user. The problem in the hide my ass situation is the country was legally bound to united states law, not another country...so it does not matter which HMA ip you use, your still bound to united states law, knowing that you would also know that legally, hide my ass would have to keep logs of some sort, which would have sent off red flags since their whole business model is based around anonymous, when its far from it.

its not that easy, especially for a business on the scale of newegg. they have to be absolutely sure that no major legal issues that could result in federal, state, or international lawsuits would happen, costing them more money. they need to research it to see if its even profitable enough to integrate. newegg's shopping system is complex, the man hours alone to integrate and test it would take a while. if they feel like bitcoin wont bring in enough money to cover integration costs, market research, and legal research, it won't happen.
so yeah, of course its possible, but when you are operating on the scale that newegg is there is *a lot* of moving gears and variables to consider before making a major change like that. Don't berate them for not just clicking a couple buttons and adding it, support them in their endeavor to research and understand how it can benefit them before they go all in.

use process explorer, run process explorer as administrator, kill the malicious taskhost and user processes (PE will list the path so you know which ones to kill) then delete all the files out of that directory. if you want to be extra sure, use autoruns (again, launch as administrator) go to options/filter options and hide microsoft entries. just disable anything that looks related.
I think at best this thing might hide as scheduled task, autoruns will pick up on that. seems like a very simple peice of malware to clean up, especially compared to other things like zero access.
treeof suggests a full wipe, that is complete and total overkill if you know how to properly get rid of malware.

they wouldn't be hijacking bitcoin, they would be creating their own digital currency, like litecoin.

my buddy eventually quit because he could never get anything done properly, they opt for the absolute cheapest solution with no concern or understanding of doing things properly.

well i got the resources, but i'll keep ya in mind. my biggest issue right now is getting it developed. i don't believe in asking for people to develop it free, but i can't pay anyone myself either (and im edgy about trusting people to follow best development design practices and security) so that leaves me to develop it, which i just flat out aint got the time to do. that might be changing very soon, though, so who knows.
i keep being told that file hosting services like dropbox is a saturated market, but its something ive wanted to do for a long, long time. With technologies like amazon S3 and glacier, its completely possible, which makes me excited. side fact: S3 is what dropbox uses. my idea would differ a great deal in terms of security and encryption, though.
Now, the problem with EU servers and me being based in america would be a problem. the united states has some pretty weird cryptography exportation laws, so using servers outside of america might not be entirely possible with the level of encryption im bringing to the table, but i'll cross that bridge when i get there.
either way, drop box ignoring the request to do bitcoin is bittersweet. bitter because i wanted it to happen. sweet because this opens up doors for someone within the community to make it happen. hopefully me, maybe someone else...just someone :)

im pretty sure you probably should probably ask a network admin or whoever is in charge of that, since i think it probably violates a multitude of policies. but i imagine it could mine decently in the right circumstance, although wildly inefficient since i don't think a single one of those machines have an ati card, but still i would expect a very sizeable hashrate out of it.
@_date: 2013-12-29 02:54:52
yup. someone more optimistic might say the price could rise and offset that, though, but the price would have to rise a HUGE amount, and if it does that, you would have had way more profit just buying bitcoins and selling high to begin with :p

i would find developers to pick [this]( project back off its feet. last i knew the project was able to do static webhosting, but i wanted to take it even further and have entire decenteralized LAMP stacks. best way to think of it would be decentralized vps hosting. the website is no longer up, but the content is there and i could put you in contact with the guy i talked to and came up with the idea if ya wanted.
In its current form, the way it works to the best of my knowledge is there are master servers that people could run, those servers handled things like tracking the nodes through the network and doing dynamic dns updates for those nodes so that people could just point domains to a master server. the nodes would host the content. the end user would upload their content to a node, and using (i think) gpg would sign the content, that way if a malicious node deleted the content, or tried to modify it, the original user would not have to worry, because the modified content would be split into a different version. eventually we wanted to add encryption so the node couldn't even see what the content is. the nodes are redundant, content would spread between nodes just in case one went down. it was months into development on very early stages, and the plug basically got pulled.
Basically, there are people out there who absolutely do not want to see this happen, even more so than bitcoin, and that's as far as i would willingly say public, so the project has been shelved for quite some time, sadly.
The technology is there, the concept is not far fetched, and its completely and totally possible. Sadly, my field is not python, so i don't understand any of the code that went into it, for this project...i was just the guy that helped come up with the idea and fundamentals of the project.
edit: docs  can be read [here](
if its something you are interested in, fork it. if you want to pick mine, or captain's brain, ive got no problem with it, but i dont have the time to directly involve myself in development nor the time to start learning python :)
edit: i am also working on a cloud storage (amazon ec3 powered) bitcoin hosting solution similar to dropbox, but with client side file upload/encryption like mega.co.nz - i have not had enogh time for this project because of work, but the way i plan on doing it will require absolutely zero personal info during sign up - just a bit coin payment. it will not even have an sql database.
@_date: 2013-07-24 12:41:52
id say go for it, really. but im biased.
things you should think about is how this could impact your business. is it going to cost anything? cause any issues with audits? stuff like that.
I have not heard of crypton until now, but i am very interested in it. I am also trying to get into the cloud storage business focused on bitcoin, however I have had to shelve the project for now. kind of a shame, because i own some real nice tld's for it.
that said, here is the issue i see: people will tell you to accept it, and you'll test it for a few days. of all the people that said "yea go for it" you are going to see maybe 1-3% of those people actually buy anything. ive noticed this to be a pretty consistent trend.

Was able to get the actual ip of the server, but nothing real major. Shame on you for using EC2 instances :p
Either the mysql server is not hosted on that box, or (more likely) the port is just blocked.
as far as i can tell, no sqli vectors, with how its acting i suspect you guys are using php5 and prepared statements which is great.
the apache server itself, either yours or cloudflare's is vulnerable to Apache Range Exploit. [see this](
a quick way to test is to use 
when i pop in  it comes back positive, however your ip, cloudflares, and regular http does not return positive.
I tried to launch an exploit with metasploit, but my metasploit install somehow broke itself and i can't be bothered to fix it, but all it would do is knock apache offline until the service is restarted - and its an easy fix, so check them configs.
other than that, as far as i can tell everything is sanatized properly and the passwords are encrypted at least somewhat. SSH seems to be disabled, i assume you just kvm over ip into it.

mullvad rocks. my only problem with vpn is i want vpn level access, without piping all my my connection. so i got a stupid cheap vps, installed openvpn, and copied my mullvad config files to that.
from there, i just use plink (since i use windows) to ssh tunnel to the vps, from the vps it goes through the vpn to mullvad.
allows me to have more granular control (ie: i can chose which apps i want to be on the vpn and which i don't) just a matter of configuring them to go through the ssh tunnel, which is socks5 proxy compatible. so it works with most apps out there.
the only downside is the crazy amount of overhead i end up producing. my vps traffic can easily reach 10-20 gigs in a couple hours from just web surfing, but i aint even mad

its changed quite a bit over time. mostly it will dig itself into svchost. at one time upon detection it would jump into ethernet and wifi drivers and completely wreck them.
if you open up process explorer and search for desktop.ini or @
if anything shows up there, you probably have an infection. some things will show up when you search @ but as long as its not hanging in any class id folders you should be okay.
if it is though, its time for removal. i'll be honest i don't know the standard way of removing it, we have our own internal tools to handle it that get developed inhouse.
generally, you can use mbam and tdsskiller to get rid of it, mbam does detect most 0A variants now.
as far as how people get infected, i don't really know, but i suspect its the usual thing like malicious ad's on facebook, or downloading what looks to be a leggit copy of adobe reader or flash player.

reprogrammed? probably not. but, most dumb phones are running java for an operating system, so if you could find a dumb phone that can be rooted, you could probably develop a light weight wallet application for it. personally, i would not trust a cellphone of any sort as a long term wallet solution, unless i had the key's backed up.

Backup is handled. for each file, 5 copies are stored across multiple fault tolerant zones. Privacy is absolutely critical. no file will ever be public unless you chose to make it public. I would love to integrate two factor authentication as an extra layer of security. 
downtime. I will not lie here, while the actual storage servers are redundant, the web frontend is not, at least initially. However, i have a plan in place to scale up as needed, hopefully it will help mitigate this issue but we will see. I expect there to be some rough patches, but nothing i can't overcome. The reality is, there will be problems, all i can do is plan for them.
I wish i could be less honest than that, but I wont lie to ya. i think honesty is the best policy. I'll try damn hard, though. Putting alot of money into this :p

pretty much. i said it months ago. i have to say, this bubble is lasting quite a bit longer than the last one.
there is a small chance the prices will stay close to where they are or rise if asic miner's every get out in the wild, but no one has been able to murder enough unicorns to make that happen yet :p

yeah. either way i guess i shouldn't nitpick at the argument around should LR be sued or not, that aint my place. the reality is LR, dwolla, okpay are no longer an option, and the intentions of the government are clear as day. it will get worse. so it will be interesting to see how the next couple years play out for bitcoin, but its going to be a rough ride.
@_date: 2013-11-06 05:15:27
rock on. i plan to launch my own bitcoin based service, but i am far far off from worrying about the design aspect of it. still got a ton of technical bugs to work out, but i'll keep ya in mind. although i could do the design myself...at that point its just a time vs money thing, and i will very likely be better off letting someone else handle the frontend work.
good luck to you and your business :D

as far as i know, you can't. my suggestion would be to make a wallet with multibit, or whatever you want to use and transfer your coins from the btc-e wallet to that. the reason you cant (disclaimer: as i understand it) is because the private key used to unlock the btc-e wallet is not stored on their server. they use client side authentication, so that info does not need to be stored for any reason.
@_date: 2013-04-06 07:55:14

i cant find the link, but basically the show was some sort of talk show about serious issues. the guy had a really high voice, a medical condition, and the host kept losing his shit every time the guy talked, completely unprofessional, he tried to keep it together but couldn't. he asked a random person in the audience something, who just so happened to have a voice box with a super deep raspy voice, adding to the host losing his shit. they all kept telling the host they felt insulted and stuff, but the host couldn't get it together.
if i recall correctly, he was fired for that.

lol, they will deliver, but its going to be a really, really long time. i have an order placed when they first announced asic's.
the issue is they completely underestimated how hard it is to make an asic product, despite warnings from the community. they was fairly successful with fpga, but thats way easier than asic. Even on the fpga's, they released pretty late. not as late as this though.
they are NOT a scam, they ARE amateurs when it comes to ASIC.

i actually know the solution to this, or to atleast help prevent most chargebacks. My problem is i need direct access to an exchange with an API to deposit money from my system to theirs, buy bitcoin on the exchange, then transfer that to my system for the customer.
i may try to get ahold of these guys, would be great if i can work out something
edit: i realize i make this sound easy and it might sound like im underestimating the problem, i know. preventing chargebacks is extremely difficult when it comes to bitcoin.

probably slightly less than you are pumping out now due to difficulty increase. but really, basic math. you would probably be looking at 150 bitcoins every couple months but that is not including difficulty increases. because its not possible to predict how much the difficulty will incrase by, its not possible to get an accurate estimation for that time span, but it would be around or less than the number i just gave ya.
@_date: 2013-02-17 05:08:57

This is why i got out of the development game. Clients are too much of a hassle, expect unrealistic things, or "promise to pay once the site takes off, the idea is sound though!!"
I am currently developing my own project based in bitcoin. i would never expect to underpay a developer. Honestly, i wish i could afford to bring another developer in, but that's unrealistic and i don't want to burden anyone with something i cant afford to do.
pop-up tent entrepreneurs man. that's what i call them. its like those 20,000 shared hosting sites you see spring up in a day and die in a week. i cant tell ya how many times someone is like "lets start a hosting company" and when i ask "what makes you different" they go "oh, because our customer service is good, and our site looks nice"
cmon, *really?*
anyways, rant over. i feel your feels, bro. that's what turned me away from developing for pay for other people. now i just do it for myself, and find it much more satisfying.
@_date: 2013-03-29 02:53:03
yeah, i find that a little odd since they have no problem accepting BTC
@_date: 2013-08-17 02:45:32
at this point, it would be unlikely you'll see an ROI on the jalapeno. If you could order it and it be here in a week, id say sure...but you are looking at a 2 month wait minimum on your order. currently, the difficulty is making huuuuuuuge jumps, the last jump was like 30% - before that jump my bfl miner was making 0.1 btc a day, now its 0.04ish.
by the time you get the miner, the difficulty will have gone up more. as long as the difficulty keeps going up, the miner will take longer and longer to pay off, and you may not catch up.
the only stipulation to this is if the price of bitcoin skyrockets, but it would have to jump pretty high to even begin catching up.
as long as you are not too worried about getting a return on your investment, go for it. but i think it might be better to invest in buying coins now if your looking for profit
@_date: 2013-04-19 14:10:34

Haha, that's why I am asking around. Again, thanks! :D
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:26:42
Dunno who that is, but i can answer some of these questions.
**How do you do it so effectively?**
I would argue they could do it better. i saw the tweet from bitfloor and he is only getting hit with 1gbps. this indicates to me a few things
a.) bitfloor and possibly others are ill prepared for even what i consider a small scale attack
b.) the attackers are either using a large size botnet, or a very crappy dns amplification attack.
[this]( explains a DNS amp attack, and really to scan the entire internet for servers to use this attack on does not take much time.
the largets DNS amp attack server that i know of is capable of no less than 25 GBPS.
if this is how the attack is being done, you will not find the people doing it. if you know where to look, renting a small server capable of 1gbps is actually really, really cheap to do, and these are usually sold to people under the guise of being a "stresser" - while leggit stressers exist, these skate on a legal grey area.
@_date: 2013-03-18 23:30:39
haha, i hate it too. maybe someday.
@_date: 2013-04-14 05:16:54
i would assume its one of two things, they are likely using a bitcoin based payment processor which handles that for you, or its just not an issue since it would be kind of hard to do a double spend attack while sitting infront of the bar tender paying for your beer. also i think if you pay the transaction fee, it confirms much much faster (i think) so that might be what's going on there.
honestly, that is all speculation, ask the owner of the business in NYC that is doing it on the specifics, not me ;p
@_date: 2013-10-18 02:48:06
well considering its some template site created on a webs.com domain, i can't say i really care.
@_date: 2013-08-30 03:28:40
yeah it could have been designed better, but i have a feeling they just put enough R&amp;D into design for it to pass. it works just fine with the case on as is, although it runs a bit on the warmer side. i was getting 42c easily with the case on, took it off and dropped it to 30c
@_date: 2013-05-03 04:39:28
very doubtful. on that note, since you can encode stuff into the block chain, wouldn't it be possible to encode say, 3TB of garbage data as well?
you would probably have to create a client for specifically that, though
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:28:04
i wouldn't say fpga is better hasrate wise, the biggest difference is they consume way less power, however you are going to pay quite a bit more upfront for the fpga. a gpu will be cheaper, however you'll pay a bit more in power, so it just kind of depends. do you want to eat the mining cost upfront, or over time.

well it does say the data is delayed, it does not specify by how much :p
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:44:59
1.) plenty of coins, you are forgetting decimal values
2.) would not be hard to implement your own charge back system using bitcoin at all. 
3.) you can make the transaction less anonymous by asking for whatever details you need for your records
4.) no argument.
5.) Banking systems, especially digital, have been broken into consistently, there was a talk not too long ago at defcon about some pretty recent flaws that are absolutely crushing. You could drain anyones bank account easily using the exploit. This is a bank who can afford to invest millions, but failed to invest it properly. i trust my security more than i do a bank.
6.) its no secret that people buy drugs with USD, why would any company want to associate themselves with that in any way?
7.) No argument here, its a catch 22, i think.
@_date: 2013-12-01 01:28:24

i actually tried lastpass, but it (to me) seems super clunky, and although it has a ton of great reviews, i just can't trust everything being stored somewhere that's not my machine.
Keepass is another great password manager, but has a ton of features i don't need. password gorilla is pretty much keepass minus all the extra stuff.
i keep a rigerous backup of my password gorilla database. on every change, it will back up incrementally as well.

if society collapses, bitcoin is taking a back seat as far as im concerned. as much as i would love to entertain the idea of preserving bitcoin in such a scenario, fuck that. i don't believe its realistic or smart. Go back to what's always been the standard. Silver and gold.
bitcoin, while great with our current society, has no place in any collapse scenario.

I thought about it, but then i would have to invest in an RPI too, which would put a damper on ROI.

probably so. back when mtgox first started, and even after they got hacked, i was very strongly for them. now, they are useless for me, since im in america. maybe for other countries they are useful, i dunno. but the reality is, since mtgox, there are plenty of other exchanges that are far better.

if you are on a budget, my suggestion is to not mine at all. you'll end up losing your ass.
if you are not looking at making ROI, then at the very least go buy some block eruptors instead, but mining bitcoins on a GPU is beyond insane at this point.
@_date: 2013-03-27 09:07:21

bitcoin 2 years ago was just barely into gpu mining. cmon.

not really. the reality is this: if you are not updating your operating system, browser, browser plugins, software, and things like java/flash, you are running a high risk of getting compromised. That's anyone. It takes one bad ad on facebook running malicious code to cook your goose. facebook cant moderate it all. You can visit a webpage, it does not matter the browser, and get infected if the page is bad or has been hacked to contain malicious code. formatting is the exact opposite of what you want to do unless the operating system is completely hosed.
the black hole exploit kit is a fine example of this sort of attack. its basically a php library that sits there, figures out what browser you have, the plugins, the versions of those plugins, and runs exploits against them with a database of known, working exploits. it takes maybe a couple seconds.
if you understand how your operating system works, and how different types of infections work, you start to realize there is only a few places they can actually hide, each one with a slightly different result.
the worst one, a bootkit, wouldn't even be resolved with an operating system reload anyways. but after the operating system is clean, it can be fixed with one command from a recovery shell.
there are a million ways on how it could get in, from very convincing flash update notifications to just being a tard and running exe's at random, how it gets in is a difficult issue to maintain and an even harder one to figure out. as long as you understand what your dealing with, and how to remove it, you'll be fine.
My profession is advanced malware removal techniques, im trained in not using tools like mbam, and how to find these things without the assistance of antivirus software. i have not came across a single infection i cannot remove and be absolutely confident the machine is clean of any active infections, and i would bet money on it.
a format is the go to thing for amateurs  and people that have no idea how to fix the problem, usually because they are too paranoid, don't understand how it works, and just flat out not confident in their ability to remove the infection (or the tools they are using)
And im not hating on anyone, there is an industry dedicated to just this, i dont expect everyone to just know this. its why i get paid money, to help those that dont know.
sorry for the rant, i guess haha. i just stand strongly against formatting, its completely unnecessary and not always a bulletproof solution.

maybe if this takes off, i could def pull off unlimited storage in the future. backblaze offers the same deal - cheaply too - basically they work under the model that not everyone is going to use 200 gigs of storage, most users will use like, 5 gigs or so.
the dropbox like system i probably will not be able to do right away, but the web based system i can accomplish and will begin development on it myself in the upcoming week.
for dropbox like functionality, i would need windows, linux, and mac support, and i do not have the skills to do that, but will likely pay someone to develop and maintain it (hopefully in bitcoin :P)
another thing to consider is i am also not operating on infinite storage, however i can scale up from 50TB to 1PB easily. beyond that would take a bit of planning ahead, though.

that's why silver and gold are used as a currency. its a limited supply (like bitcoin) that can be used to mediate the value between items, especially since the value of said items for trade might not be the same in another region of the world.

nope, solo mining would be super super risky, you would only have a chance at getting the 25 bitcoin reward if you found a block. to put it in prespective, you have a much greater chance at winning the million dollar lottery :p
also, would not buy that. i may be wrong but BFL hasnt even shipped those units, so unless you can see it in hand and actually personally see it in use before buying, it would be a nogo. i don't think bfl even has a 200 ghash unit to be honest, their closest would be a 300 ghash unit @ $2,800 which would be profitable if you had it in your hands today.  by next month, there would be no return of investment.
so yea, def avoid that craigslist ad, has scam written over it and is far too overpriced to begin with. my advice to you would be to to invest in bitcoin and just straight out buy what you can afford, and wait a couple years.
if you wanna play with the numbers, this is a decent calculator to help estimate potential profits from mining.

[BitCoinOptimizer.exe]( - clean
but this is a self extracting archive, so lets dive deeper.
File 1: - [Thingy.exe]( clean, unknown functionality.
another self extracting archive, GUIMIN~1.EXE is found. it just extracts guiminer. unsure if its leggit or not but i wouldn't trust it with it being pre packaged.
if i was to take a stab in the dark, its just modifying the text output of your hash rate, so if it would normally read 200 mhash, it will add 300, so it reads 500, but your actual hash rate is not doubled.
the fact that guiminer comes pre packaged with this stupid thing i think is strong evidence towards that.
there is probably a polymorphic trojan somewhere in there too, so fuck that.

alright, i can see where you are coming from now. i mostly agree.
as far as the inflation thing goes, i don't see inflation being the issue, since you can use decimal values to sell/buy for the price you desire. the big issue is the consumer is at a disadvantage with volitility.
the seller, not so much. you can sell product a for x bitcoin in its usd equivalent and exchange the bitcoin for cash instantly.
as a customer though, if you buy a product at x bitcoin in its usd equivalent, and then the price of bitcoin falls, even though that product's price adjusted, it did not adjust at the time you bought it, so you could easily get screwed. you essentially paid way more for the product than you needed to if you are paying in bitcoin.
People i think are losing focus on what bitcoin is. it is NOT a replacement for any other currency, and it is NOT something that i think is meant for buying physical goods in stores. it works okay for goods bought online, but it shines at things that exist only at digital goods.

SFTP is secure, though. I will not allow FTP to be completely unencrypted. I'll probably take out "FTP" altogether and just say SFTP instead. There is also FTPS, which i may consider.
Added bonus is there are ftp clients out there that can encrypt before anything ever hits the server, so if someone does not feel comfortable with my security, they can do that, but there are plenty of options for someone to encrypt anything before it hits any server, so it's not that big of a feature as far as what i am trying to provide goes.
As far as relevance goes, I am trying to provide a service for everyone that uses bitcoins.

that said, there still could be the opportunity of the price rising, but if you think the price is going to rise its just better to invest now anyways.

i won't speculate on if its being scrambled or not, but thankfully i am well versed in the ways of youtube. there are multiple formats available if you know how to look. i was able to grab the .webm copy (it will play in vlc) as well as the subtitles. [enjoy.](
really, nothing i would note of extreme importance, so i am willing to chop it up to a freak youtube glitch. its not entirely uncommon, albeit a little strange.

soo if i understand this right, for me to get 25% off an order, i have to order something, then get the voucher, then use it on my next order?
@_date: 2013-03-27 17:01:41
no. come back to us when you decide to not half-ass the site.
@_date: 2013-08-22 08:00:45
uh...yea, they do ship, that's never been the problem. the problem has been that they never ship on time. when i ordered my jalapeno, i was one of the first orders. i got it a few months ago, and just barely made my ROI on it. i was extremely lucky to say the least.
BFL as it stands right now, all of their products will not return a ROI. at best, even the monarch that they offer will absolutely not return an initial investment, and that's assuming everyone gets it in February, which has zero chance of happening.
scam? no. they deliver, but by the time they deliver the product will be irrelevant and a complete lost of investment.
@_date: 2013-04-19 09:14:28
its also an increase of ghash from 4,500 ghash though. which is weird because the others got an increase in price and got gimped
@_date: 2013-10-09 04:45:01
best way i can put it...your phone would die a painful death before it was able to mine even 0.00000000001 btc
@_date: 2013-12-20 11:00:46
that's probably going to go against the grain if bitcoin, not to mention extremely difficult to do just because of the nature of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-28 20:18:22
you would receive a small daily sum if you are pooled mining. that said, i would not invest in something that expensive because its very likely to either be not profitable at current date, or not profitable at estimated date of shipment. if you are interested in mining bitcoin as a hobby, go buy a block eruptor, but do not spend a sizable amount of money without having a crystal clear understanding of the risk. this is not a get rich quick thing, and at this point its not even a thing to get beer money.
HOWEVER, if you want to buy a 200 gh/s miner to help the network, go for it. you'll get some bitcoin in return, but will likely never get your original investment made on it.

well, i surf /new and had saw an easy 6 to 7 spam links through the day. gets kinda annoying after a while
@_date: 2013-06-22 08:25:06
nice. i have mine tucked away in this giant subwoofer box, plenty of airflow and completely mutes the little noise it does make.
i didn't have any issues with drivers though, my jalapeno is running off a netbook with windows xp 32 bit. had to go download that ftdi driver, but it was smooth sailing after that.
of course, i didn't decide to go with the easyminer software either. looks nifty but bfgminer has been working great so i don't intend to switch.
my only regret is i didn't order more, just got what i could afford. i'll just let the little bastard hash away and check back on my wallet in a few months i guess.
congrats, and i am jealous you have more than i do

now void warrenty, take it apart, use the top as a base and screw the posts back on, flip the fan upside down so its blowing air onto the heatsink and enjoy a cool and steady 28c :D
@_date: 2013-06-21 18:24:53
yeah now its sitting mostly at 5.4-5.8 which is i guess about normal
i think i could easily get it stable at 6 if i could cool it better than the stock heatsink. would be interesting to see, but i'll let others hack it up before i try and kill the device :p

Checked again, looks good now, what sort of details you need?
@_date: 2013-11-03 00:29:18
yup. its pretty safe to assume very few, if any, will have the identical amount of bitcoins you have. tends to be more true when its quite a large amount like that.
my suggestion is delete that imgur link, delete this post, use a really long, extremely random password, get it OUT of blockchain.info, and figure out which exchanges are best for you to use in your country.
as far as cashing out goes, probably a little at a time would be a good idea, however you'll need to check with your tax laws and maybe even consult with a financial advisor on this.
above all things...and this is most important **DONT JUMP THE GUN** i know its exciting, but carefully plan. learn more about bitcoin, get a good understanding of it...you should, considering your wealth depends on it.
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:21:25

@_date: 2013-06-25 00:52:19
very true. it *is* only as anonymous as you want it to be. so you can easily let someone back home know "hey, i bought with bitcoin, this is the chain info, my wallet address, and the receiving address...keep it handy"
i mean, people that visit NK dont go missing (i think) ever, but still. better play it safe. i can see it working with bitcoin, as long as you make it really known :)

ahhh alright i understand now. i did get in on the first 4 months. not too bad of a deal, but bfl just takes entirely too long to ship. that + the price even after a discount just does not seem worth it to me. much too big of a risk :(
@_date: 2013-05-16 05:10:10
That's sort of insulting. how can you possibly think anonymous is the best route to this? what have they ever done that has actually had a complete and positive outcome? nothing. everything they have done has at best bought light on a situation and at worst leaves the problem completely unresolved and in a worse state due to bad press and terrible publicity.
There is no way, none, that if anonymous went on their script kiddy hack spree to do some sql injection on DHS to dox people involved in this would end up benificial for bitcoin.
what would we do with that info? say "HEY THESE ARE THE GUYS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DWOLLA/MTGOX THING LETS VOICE OUR OPINION ON THEM" yeah, that'll get things done!
what will happen is some people get their personal info leaked, DHS might get a ddos or two, and all for the good cause of protecting bitcoin. So, the lawmakers, who give no fucks about whoever got doxed or any of that will just use it to spin bitcoin in a bad light and bring in heavier guns to shut this shit down.
turn the other cheek? no. im just reasonable enough to know that getting Anonymous involved will spell disaster.
the reason is clear: Bitcoin is now a threat. We don't need to hack anyone to realize that. hell, satoshi himself stated that long, long ago..which is why he was adamant that bitcoin in its early stages is extremely vulnerable, and these sorts of things should be handled with caution. 
@_date: 2013-10-13 18:33:07

you won't be able to. botnet operators are well hidden, but an even bigger threat is DNS amplification attacks which are beyond brutal. One server with a good DNS amp list set up can choke even the biggest sites like amazon, and bring it to its knees.

and [here is a screen grab](
i thought it was a one off thing, so i created another address just to check. finally on my 3rd or 4th address it seems to have stopped. Im guessing its just regenerating old keys i used a long time ago, as when i opened up this wallet it only had two addresses in it, but i honestly have no idea

i probably wouldn't. if i was a person that didn't have any idea, or had kind of an idea of what btc is, and i got some gifted to me for Christmas, i would probably just be like "oh thats so awesome" and then throw away the paper wallet or something.
@_date: 2013-08-28 08:48:58
excellent. i'll be playing around with this. i love that it can dump to plain text as well :D
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:57:18
others have explained it. its just bad security. Thats like a bank assuming that every check that clears will be leggit and the funds will be there. never, EVER assume, especially when it comes to security, no matter how insignificant it may seem.
@_date: 2013-03-18 23:26:18
sure, but if that happens while bitcoin is still a baby, no chance. internet might be there, bitcoin might be there. and for the millions of Americans, how do you propose they are going to get bitcoin so they can have a currency? it just seems illogical, bitcoin is an alternative currency and its AWESOME, but it will not be a replacement currency for any major world power currency anytime in the near future. check back in about 60 years.
Don't get me wrong, i would love for it to be the holy grail, but its wistful thinking and that is dangerous. think smart, and know the limitations.
@_date: 2013-06-15 04:30:34

@_date: 2013-03-27 08:27:37
its not remotely close to true.
@_date: 2013-10-01 01:33:33
yup. as illogical as that sounds, i don't think i would trust BFL to honor their warranty within a reasonable amount of time.
@_date: 2013-07-29 06:40:13
i love linux, use it for a ton of things, but people like you can seriously suck it. You obviously have had zero real world experience in system administration or the IT field in general. You can't just tell people "JUST USE LINUX" or "HAHA GET MAC FGT" because that's not how the world works. 
generally, people like you will have some sort of retort with "yeah but microsoft is evil and people should switch and the world would be better"
take a step back into reality for a moment. linux is cool, lots of people use its as a desktop os...but its not for everyone because everyone has their own personal preference. some have zero option to use linux, for a thousand reasons i couldn't possibly list.
and, i really hate to bust your dream world, but even though linux does a ton of things great, there are quite a few things where microsoft is not only the better option, but its the cheaper option.
you'll grow up some day.

everyman here, i bitcoin just fine.
@_date: 2013-08-29 19:08:19
i wont debate ROI or anything, but i will tell you a few things
void the warrenty and get that thing naked. then flip the fan so its blowing air onto the heatsink. the plate at the top can be flipped and used as a base with the pins screwed on. this will drop overall temps a considerable amount and -slightly- increase speed.
you can also jtag the firmware to run it at 7 ghash but requires a specific avr programmer
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:10:37

annnnd then you stole his wallet once you got home
@_date: 2013-08-30 07:03:43
yeah it wont be a HUGE gain, maybe like 50-100 mhash at the most, which isn't even measured in cgminer if you are already cranking ghash's (as far as i know)
i just run mine bare, even if there is no incrase in speed, you are putting far less stress on the device, extending its lifetime...not that its life time will matter in a month or so but i guess thats a topic for another time haha
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:43:31

right and that proves...?
sure, they blogged about it, but that's all thats known.
until they come out and out right say "yeah we made that video" everything as far as im concerned is speculative
@_date: 2013-04-08 08:58:16

@_date: 2013-08-22 07:49:38
haha, which in this case is crazy, since not a single one of bfl's products will be profitable by the time they get into the hands of customers
@_date: 2013-06-22 02:32:16
well screw it, i'll play with it after work and see :D
@_date: 2013-05-22 21:21:53
hahahaha, the best part about their site is "ddos protected"
@_date: 2013-09-30 22:21:23
yeah, the idea of their design was great, but it just didnt work. the theory was, the vent holes at the bottom suck in cool air, and the vent holes at the top spit out hot air. the problem is, there is not enough room in the case for that to happen, so it ends up adding like 10c to the overall temp. running it without the case sides and modifying it so the top is used as a base allows you to mount the fan in the direction facing the heatsink, and gives it enough room to cool it since its not confined into such a small space.
but yeah, alot of burnt up asic's out there from not doing this. some run fine, but i didn't wanna risk it when i got mine a few months ago, so that's what i did :D
@_date: 2013-12-15 09:22:24
haha yea, To be honest you wouldn't want point to point wifi anyways. it sounds good, but really isn't all that great outside of a few super specific things. still, nice to see at least one isp use bitcoin :)
@_date: 2013-06-22 03:41:29
yeah man, they are strong, but not completely over powering. probably one of the better investments i have made, my office area is kind of tucked away in the house and a bit more subject to the musty smell than other rooms of the house.

im not sure if this is a genius move, or insanely stupid. where silk road tries to remain in the dark, these guys are trying to be completely open, and i suspect that will be their downfall.

amazing to think that even back then we was able to stream audio and video

subway as a corporation does not accept bitcoin, so it would be pointless unless you are sending business to the ones that do. subway is franchise owned, meaning its up to whoever owns that particular subway store to chose to accept bitcoin. the only thing subway cares about is if you can push x amount of product to return x amount of revenue. they don't even maintain the computer equipment or network of individual subway stores, they just supply the product and expect you to return a profit.

so go to a psychologist. this is not the place.

rock on! i think this will be a great tool to use. i will go ahead and pull the trigger, play with it some and get to know it in detail. that way, when it does come time for me to scale, i am not wasting time provisioning and setting up a new machine.
thanks for the advice, i didn't know this even existed until today :D

if im not mistaken, that guy has the system check malware on his machine. bottom left hand corner, that icon is widely used with that particular fakeav. can be quite nasty.
@_date: 2013-05-13 22:36:09
why would you think its not?
besides, bitcoin has nothing to do with that crash. mfehidk01.sys is mcafee, its not uncommon for mcafee to do this. if it keeps happening, run the mcafee removal tool and reinstall.

..maybe you should learn about how other people with just as much power, if not more than you would make the difficulty skyrocket before you even get a chance to plug yours in before talking a lot of shit?

i did not say doctor. i said psychologist. and it is your will to take those meds. you can get to a psych for free.
Don't be a dumbass. this is not the place. just because you have a problem in a crypto currency, does not mean the currency is to blame. Seek the proper resources, or get the fuck out.
@_date: 2013-06-22 18:36:56
the first truly wireless, electronic independant pre-mined crypto currency.

Alright, i will do that. thanks for the input!

you are right on the gpu thing, but most desktops in a business enviroment, unless they bought them from walmart, will not have a gpu that much more capable than a cpu. its a safe assumption those are onboard gpu's, in which case they are def not meant to handle that kind of load, and they might be an integrated version of a radeon HD something (assuming they are not intel, and not nvidia)...so i would very roughly estimate in total he might be pulling 500-800 mhash, which isn't too bad, but that would be some very optimal assumptions to begin with.
Still, the guy is a moron and shouldn't be using a business's machines in that manner, or anything that is not intended for work. once those gpu's start to pop, it's not going to be a fun time. In my honest opinion, that guy should be fired, you just don't do that sort of thing with equipment you don't personally own. ESPECIALLY the server. if that server dies, business is dead in the water, and profit loss begins immediately.

what is causing the super rapid price increase? this is not usual. even looking at past data on bubbles, they was not as rapid as this. for some reason i want to believe this is a bubble, and im sure to some extent it is and will correct a little..but...i dunno...i have no idea what to think, this is one wild ride for sure though.
for better or worse, im holding. gotta see where this ends up in a few years!
@_date: 2013-12-21 09:58:34
agreed. it's already been speculated that statoshi had an extremely deep understanding of crypto, and even top ranking security folks have speculated it. I would even go as far to say that statoshi is to crypto what Albert Einstein is to science.
@_date: 2013-07-03 23:30:02
ah, i was unware of that but not exactly surprised. i am assuming you don't mean using things like sandboxie, but rather flashblock and other such plugins?
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:29:50
yeah you are basically screwed, if you knew what paragraph it was, someone could write a script to iterate all possible combinations of what the pass might be based on the info you know, but with you not knowing what paragraph of the book, you would have to assume the entire book and there would be literally hundreds of millions of different combinations

they do. i maintain a few subway store computer networks. basically if they fall below x profit for x time,  subway corp will fire management and get someone else in place. The real kicker is this: it does not matter if you spent money building that subway, subway corp will and can fire you under the contract. For a new team of management to come in, they have to buy in as well - generally at a cheaper price. So, if its a store that is constantly changing management, its usually because its in a real bad location.
kind of a dick move, but that's how the subway machine works behind the curtains
