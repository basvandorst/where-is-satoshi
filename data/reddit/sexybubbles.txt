What do you think this post is? I am not trying to hate just trying to do my part :).
Edit: "not"

I am pretty young, but I've already seen how people who are full of themselves, selfish or greedy don't seem to be happy in the end. I feel like you're losing the game if you play like that. I am currently watching a friend destroy he's life because he doesn't care and just wants to feel good now. It's really sad and I feel it doesn't have to be that way. The worst part is he won't listen to me.

My hope isn't that someone buys in for more. My hope is that everyone buys in because then only then people will realize Bitcoin is worth more than any other currency and won't manipulate the market.

Yes! I just thought that people would realize there's a lot of people jumping in on this, it has to do with money, maybe I should be careful of who I trust and verify with multiple resources. Maybe someone needs to make a bare bones comprehensive guide on how to bitcoin. I don't know.

Yes, exactly! There's nothing wrong with Bitcoin there's something wrong with people. I don't want to sounds crazy, but people need to open their fuckin eyes.

I don't think I understand. Why would no one listen?

I don't think I could of said better my self. 
I don't want there to be a black list of people you shouldn't trust, I want to be able to deiced for them self. It will be better for bitcoin and for the world to be honest.

That's really point I am trying to get across. If you're dumb enough to invest more than you're willing to lose it's our fault that your in a situation where you are literately thinking about killing your self. Maybe next time people will learn because people are quite literately dying over their own stupidity. Sorry if this sounds extreme, but I mean please prove me wrong.

What I am complaining about is two things really: people have blind trust in other people and people spending more than they should. Both of those points boil down to people being dumb.

Thing is bitcoin would be stable if people weren't so dumb. Like they just need to think about who is telling them what and why they would be doing that. I don't know why people take this way instead of doing the research themselves. It's hard first and easy anytime after that, plus you are confident in your own decision rather than trusting some fuck cunt.
