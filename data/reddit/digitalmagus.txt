I agree, many of the talks were impressive, but meeting the people was the best part.

TL;DR: I am uploading 3 videos of Day 1 of conference: 
Greetings, I did a small amount of horrible cam job recording of the kick off speeches, but it's watchable for those who really want to see it now. Apologies for shakiness, bad sound, bad focus and possibly even getting parts cut off . It is my understanding that the Bitcoin Foundation has professional videographers at the event, however their videos may not make it to youtube for another week or two. Until then, enjoy these bits and pieces. I may manage to record a few of the seminars on Saturday or Sunday, and will upload them if/when I have time, but no promises at all (please don't ask me). I hope others manage to do some recording to and share with the community. It's 3AM here and *the videos are starting to upload now to youtube* (it may take a couple of hours), but you can search digitamagus7 user on youtube for 3 videos of the kickoff.  Enjoy!

He was ok, but not great. I think he could have prepared better for the bitcoin crowd specifically, though he did throw in a few lines in there. I don't think anyone got up and walked though, so it wasn't *that* bad.

Heh, just to clarify, I didn't record the whole thing, only the sessions I attended. Given at any point in time there were 4 or 5 sessions going on in parallel, there was no way I could be in all rooms at once. Also, I believe that once the Bitcoin Foundation posts their videos you will see they are much better quality than mine... in the meantime, yeah, I will keep uploading the videos.. 30+ so far, and many more to come. I should hopefully be done with them all in the next day or two.
@_date: 2013-05-19 06:41:28
At every session I've attended there's at least one or two professional videographers with tripods &amp; high end cameras. I believe they work for Bitcoin Foundation, and their intention is to release them as soon as possible; however, unlike me, they will do professional video editing and what not, which can be time consuming. I also really look forward to their videos because at any given hour, I could only attend one out of 4 or 5 parallel sessions. Cheers :)

While at bitcoin2013, I met a couple of nice guys who started a Bitcoin BitPay like service in Argentina. I told them, 'You guys are doing an amazing service to your country!' Their website is: 
FYI, "pagos" means 'paid' in plural form. Top right of page you can select language.
@_date: 2013-05-27 18:16:16
I wouldn't be so hard on them (yet). I did zero editing. I heard they were trying to get the slides from all the presenters and show them side by side with the video, as well, I think they have a review (approval?) process with the panalists, hence why it is taking them longer. Also, FYI, it takes ~1.5 to 2 hours to upload 10 mins worth of video, and I was uploading right from the conference via wifi all day long + at my hotel overnight etc. So I easily got a 3 day head start on them. I look forward to their videos, as I wanted to attend a few other sessions I missed out on. PS. Thanks for the tip :)

Here's some videos from Day 2 as well. Enjoy!

Ditto. Now just looking forward to wire Xfers announcement &amp; litecoin support. PS. Thanks for coming onto the Ed &amp; Ethan show and providing your customer base with useful information about what is going on behind the scenes. I actually learned a couple of useful things from you guys.

1) The link to FINCEN's "guidance": 
2) A good article explaining the guidance with less lawyer speak.

More like this for me... it was missing a few options.

Thanks for the mention. I've uploaded over 55 videos, and still another 1/2 dozen to go. I've updated the descriptions to most of them now, and will finish creating the remaining playlists tomorrow. I agree not all are great quality, but it's the best I could do with my $200 pocket HD camera. I didn't have a connection from the microphones to my camera, so it was either sit in the back of the room and get great sound but lots of people's back of heads in the video, or sit up front and get some great video, but crappy sound because  the speakers were too far away (try using headphones). I didn't go to the conference with the intention to record, but it seemed nobody else other than 1 professional recorder was doing it in the back of the room, so I decided to give it a shot. I'm just sitting there anyway, why not record it? I think lots of people had small cameras and phones that could record, but it did actually take quite a bit of co-ordination, 2x32GB of SD memory and 2 batteries wasn't even enough. I was swaping batteries every 1.5-2 hours and towards the end of the day every 20-30 mins, as they couldn't hold charge anymore. I also was uploading nearly 24/7, from conference wifi, from hotel wifi while I slept, from Airport WiFi, now from home wifi etc. Note that each 10 mins of HD video is aprox a 2.5 GB  file that takes ~1.5 hours to upload to youtube. I'm uploading over 60 files - you do the math ;-) Hope some of you got something out of it. Drop me a small tip if you did. Cheers!

yeah sorry, I didn't record Gavin's talk. I attended a different session. I heard his was super popular.. packed room.

Hi, you both make some good points. Botnets can be huge and cheap to rent. I recall only a few years ago some russian website was renting out 20,000 compromised PCs per hour for something like $20, but at most a malicious person  could leverage CPU+GPU power for a few hundred thousand users which could definitely harm litecoin at present, but pales in comparison to ASICs mining in the Gh/s in bitcoin.  Still, if bitcoin cost keeps rising into the stratosphere (very unlikely in technical analysis theory), then botnets may rise and impact profitability of non-ASIC users in bitcoin, but I doubt could get large enough to create a 51% attack.
Normif's concern about government tax-funded (more like black ops funded) ASIC-farms is technically possible; however, it ignores that other countries wanting to see the continued and controlled devaluation of the US dollar hegemony, would start black ops projects of their own to keep bitcoin alive and thus produce ASIC farms of their own. More realistically, I think the US government/Fed, would first attempt an attack via legislation - because, after all they are all lawyers and academics. But what we've seen just last week, was I think mostly positive with the Treasury Dept/FINCEN wanting virtual currency exchanges to abide by anti-laundry policies, which in my eyes is a legitimization of the bit currency itself. 
If you read that government mandate, you will realize one thing, bitcoin was not mentioned directly. Instead, they used the term "virtual currencies" as a catch all term, although a lot of the language sure seemed to be aimed at bitcoin. My point is, it's good that bitcoin is not the only game in town, and I say that to include not just crypto currencies, but upcoming amazon coins, Xbox credits, linden dollars and whatever else comes down the pipe. The more diversification, the harder it is for government to tie a noose around a competing currency (to the US dollar). So overall, I agree with Normif, competing currencies will actually help stabalize bitcoin. Lastly, I'd hate for some major attack or bug take down  bitcoin and no other virtual currencies were available to keep the dream alive. Cheers.

I am feeling encouraged after all the networking I did yesterday. I see lots of brain power and $ showing interest in this, and I definitely see the passion in everyone's eyes.

Also, this is a better link to my videos. Shows them all:
At any rate, I am aiming to put them all in numerical order and with titles of the sessions, or what the video is about.
Cheers :)

1) US dollar will not hyperinflate - Read your history, no global reserve currency has ever hyperinflated. Hyperinflation does however occur to 3rd world countries with some frequency. At most the US dollar will experience some periods of high inflation during a UST bond crisis.Please don't dream of the US dollar hyperinflating, such an event would practically guarantee a massive global depression, failed civil revolutions not unlike Egypt and at the extreme possibly even larger wars of sorts. As much as I dislike what's going on, I don't wish for that event at all. Every sane US antagonist nation (i.e. China, Russia, MENA countries) know this and thus why they are not attempting to collapse the US dollar overnight.
2) US dollar has been slowly losing status as reserve currency since at least the inception of the Euro (Aprox 35% of all fiat reserves are held in the Euro currency), and recently as BRIC nations have bypassed the US dollar and execute direct bilateral trade with each other. In short, it is a process, not an event; and because it drags on for quite a while, it does not trigger hyperinflation.
3) Once the US does lose the majority of its status as a global reserve currency (don't hold your breath, this could drag on for at least another 5-10 years) it will be highly questionable if any one other nation will ever hold such power, as by now any nation with half a brain will have realized the unfair advantages of such power over everyone else, this aside from the Triffen dilemma issue that comes with such power. The powers that be have been discussing an "SDR" (Sovereign Drawing Right) - in essence a basket of goods to which global currencies can be priced against. Problem is they can't seem to agree on what those goods should be, or in what % (i.e. 10% Euro, 30% USD, 20% gold, 15% CNY, etc).  Further, given they are simply pricing fiat against mostly more fiat, it is a system that if enacted, is destined to eventual failure as well. Failure to agree on this before or during the global storm that a UST bond crisis would create, automatically results in Plan B being gold - given all major central banks hold it (except Canada...LOL). As such, I see Bitcoin as a very very distant third  - plan C... by the people. Pigs will fly in a frozen hell before Central Banks adopt Bitcoin ;-)
I'd like to add that none of the above takes away from your overall theme, that over time the fiat Keynesian global debt based economy will continue to implode on itself, and people's trust in governments all around the world will continue to erode, and slowly they will adopt bitcoin.
PS. QE may not go on forever... Fed just announced 'tapering' of QE may be on the horizon, and this slightest of hints is why the markets have turned negative in the past few days.

Sorry, I attended a different lecture. I heard it was one of the most popular talks, if not the most popular (facebook twins aside).
@_date: 2013-05-27 06:34:29
Yep, but my $200 camera auto-stops recording at 10mins for some reason. I know I could concatenate them all, but in the interest of getting them all out there as quickly as possible, I just uploaded them as fast as I could.
@_date: 2013-06-24 16:47:36
I've called them 3 times before to ask questions. They picked up the phone immediately each time (during business hours). In fact the last time I called, one guy answered the call from his car phone. Not sure if that's a good thing or bad, but he spent 15 minutes on phone answering all my questions and could navigate their website from memory.
@_date: 2013-05-18 22:27:38
You are most welcome, and thanks for the tip. I know there's lots of people that couldn't come for all kinds of reasons. For day 2 I have over 22 videos to upload already so keep an eye on that Youtube URL.

Jim Rickards (guy arguing against bitcoin) is actually one of the very few well respected individuals on TV who frequently comments on the Federal Reserve's recent and potential future moves. Look him up on youtube, lots of media related videos with him. His understanding and insight into the federal reserve far surpasses anybody I've seen/read/heard. He is also the author of the popular "Currency Wars" book. Having said this, while I was somewhat impressed by his knowledge of bitcoin (compared to what is said in MSM these days), I felt he was only arguing against them for the sake of this debate. I think if he was put on the other side of the debate, he could have just as easily argued for bitcoin.  As others have mentioned, a lot of his points were quick/cheap shots at bitcoin that don't really hold much water. Most of it was pointing out recent failures/concerns, nearly all of which have been addressed in one form or another and won't be repeated. I think part of the problem is that this debate was far too short, and each side was speaking as fast as possible, throwing as many "facts" at the wall as fast as possible and seeing if anything stuck. What's with hyper-speed debates anyway? This could have easily been turned into a good 2 hour long debate. Also, don't get the wrong impression from this debate, Jim Rickards is not pro fiat, by any stretch of the imagination and he is worth listening to on matters related to the Fed.

Oh but I do believe they did record high quality video and audio and every lecture as well (unlike me). My understanding is that they are in the process of uploading their videos as soon as they are done editing them. Hopefully soon. Even I am looking forward to those as I missed out on ~75% of all the lectures

I'm Portuguese. The publication is basically an introductory video, not necessarily an actual article that made it to the newspapers. Further, as anyone can tell, it's just a 3 minute video which doesn't really delve into many details but rather gives a 10,000 foot level overview of the basic concepts - a good start I suppose. That said, it sadly does mention that bitcoins are used to sell drugs and launder money etc.. Same old MSM faux argument in the sense that drugs and arms deals are performed in US dollars and Euros, in the many dozens of billions per year which would correspond to many THOUSANDS if not dozens of thousands of times more than what is likely being done in Bitcoins. Then it also touches upon the Amazon coin, but says nothing about centralized virtual currencies vs decentralized, nor inflation vs deflationary currencies, which is a real shame. Oh well, better than nothing.

You are most welcome. I know if I couldn't have made it, I would have also very much appreciated it. Also, lots of young people who can't afford $1,000 to $2,000 to make their way over to the conference (flight+hotel+transportation+conference $300).

Hi, I am one of the business partners of BitCentury, the company who originally posted this video on youtube and on our website: 
Curious somebody made a reddit post about our video! FYI we have made a few other blog posts @  (click the blog titles to see more info and pictures). Keep an eye on the blog for more experiments, results and other upcoming developments related to the BitFury chips.
PS. I use vi, so I hope that means we're not completely lost ;-) 
PPS. We also have a bitcointalk forum thread where you can learn more about us. It is regarding our (now closed) international proxy delivery service of Metabank's Russian mining rigs:
