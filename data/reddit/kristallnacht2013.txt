It doesn't matter. People who would jump on an "opportunity" like this to profit off of stolen property deserve to get scammed!

Maybe it could be compared more to the Kristallnacht, where Jews' properties were ransacked and their possessions were stolen or destroyed. They might as well have just used "drug seizure" as the reason for taking all of their property. The federal government has broad powers to steal anything connected to a drug case with impunity, and they are rarely questioned for doing so. Even if you are just a landlord whose tenant has been suspected of dealing or manufacturing drugs, your property can be seized.
And just because the federal government gives someone an opportunity to claim their property, does that make it right to seize and sell it? No, there hasn't even been a trial yet! Also, they never even made any kind of good faith effort to notify potential claimants of funds seized from Silk Road. Many of these users were not US citizens that were not subject to US law, and very well may not have been doing anything illegal in their country. Even some American users of Silk Road may not have been using the service for illegal purposes!
In the same way, they could have given Jews 45 days to claim their seized property. But would they have been able to make a claim or would the claim process have been just and fair? Would that have made it right for the Nazis to go around seizing others' possessions? Absolutely not! It's 75 years after the fact, and they are still coming up with art and other property that is alleged to have been stolen from Jewish victims of Nazi Germany.
