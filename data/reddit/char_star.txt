Yeah, that would be much easier to do since it would not require changes to the protocol per se. Maybe just a check box in the GUIs that says "discourage empty blocks" 
@_date: 2015-06-15 23:06:04
People can write lies in the block chain,  so I don't see how it suddenly becomes a wellspring of truth. The only thing that you can say with confidence is that the data in a given block existed at that time. It doesn't mean that the data contains truths.

So when did you pay the inventor of electricity to get on the Internet? 
@_date: 2015-06-23 00:50:50
Early on in Bitcoin, most blocks only had the one coinbase transaction. If we had a rule requiring a minimum transaction count and if for some reason there were no transactions to process, miners would just make a bunch of dummy transactions to meet the minimum. And even if there were transactions, it would be faster to make dummy transactions than it would be to wait for others to propagate into the miner node's pool. So a minimum wouldn't work unless we drastically altered the protocol and even then, it might not.

This is why I argue that more depth is needed. Bitcoin defies common sensibilities. People are used to thinking of money and financial services as something that are controlled by a central person, and they can't fathom that it is uncontrolled and dependable at the same time. That's why I think it's important to put an emphasis on the various built-in incentives (like transaction fees) that help people understand why the system is self-regulating.
@_date: 2014-08-04 04:29:51

I've been following Bitcoin for a long time, and the one problem I still don't understand is this: how do we prevent people having to wait up to 10 minutes at a convenience store or something just because they decided to pay with Bitcoin? I know that someone will say "oh third party solutions will jump in and help." But if you're going to use a third party solution, why not just use Visa or Mastercard at that point? You've already abandoned most of the benefit of Bitcoin by re-centralizing the protocol in a third-party point-of-sale platform (e.g. Bitpay, etc.).
And please don't give a non-answer "people will be using Bitcoin, and they won't even know it" because that just implies another third-party solution. I want to know how Bitcoin can solve this through modifications to its own protocol or similar.

I personally thought the one I posted earlier was worthy of being considered one of the more complete, easy-to-understand explanations of Bitcoin, but some have dissented. I suppose it could be improved a bit (however I don't think terms such as "ledger" and "node" should be considered jargon as the OP has seemed to suggest), but I'd appreciate some feedback rather than contrariness. Here's my post: [Layman's Explanation of Bitcoin]( It's extremely difficult to explain how it actually works without oversimplifying to the point of not being useful to understanding what makes it special, so that's why I use words that are not strictly technical in nature, but slightly higher than conversational English.
I agree whole-heartedly that understanding is more important than awareness. It's not just "internet hacker fun bux" like the loudly ignorant dissenters seem to think it is. It's scary how little the supposed authority figures in finance seem to understand Bitcoin.

This would probably be better than pretty much anything he could do if he's trying to help the network.
