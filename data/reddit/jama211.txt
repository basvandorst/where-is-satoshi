Holy shit you can!! 
It helped me to hide the black lines on the right with my hand first 
@_date: 2015-06-30 12:54:54
I hadn't even thought of hiding money in that way! Brilliant...

He didn't say the coins would be insecure, he said the *value* would be insecure, which is true. The currency has fluctuated value on the level of orders of magnitude in less then a year before. Shits dangerous.

But the euro is more stable and more accepted than BTC right now 
@_date: 2015-06-30 09:02:27
Doesn't change the fact that barely any company by percentage accepts it. Being possible to not die with Bitcoin, and being able to use it in reasonable everyday life are two very very different things. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 09:10:00
Because if it's not there in cash... 
@_date: 2015-06-30 09:08:41
This is a great point, the value wouldn't likely be recognised by any border control. That being said though, always terrifying having your life savings in your pocket 
@_date: 2015-06-30 09:07:40
No, the real problem is the value fluctuates too much for most people to want to take the risk. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 09:11:56
So it's passing the countries economic problem.. to the country? Makes sense to me

Can't link to it from here, it was on the darknet.

It's a word common people use to label something that seems too fanatical about something to still be rational about it. You'd be good to heed it. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 17:19:34
Thank you!

Any level which rises it out of the population. Similar to "How much is something worth?" "It's worth as much as someone will pay for it." 
@_date: 2015-05-20 15:26:21
But it makes it seem like a cult. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 17:18:54
Call it all you want, it doesn't make it less true.

I bought at $800 and when it dropped to $500 I cut my losses and sold it all. I was anxious for a while about doing that but now I'm really glad I got out when I did. 
Unfortunately, I don't think the price will rise again until ordinary people become interested in it, and I feel that will never happen while it is so inaccessible as it is now. 
If it rises above $500 again, I might buy some. But I won't start buying a lot until there are indications the general population might want it, and that my coins can't be hacked and stolen, which has happened to many many people. Bitcoin just isn't safe unless you manage the coins yourself, and even then you can lose them. 
Banks aren't necessarily safe either but, the ones in my country sure have a better track record than bitcoin, and the value is a lot more stable. There will never be widespread adoption of bitcoins until it is at least as safe and stable as fiat. That's just the way normal people are going to see it.

Thats... exactly what Anderson was saying, don't use it unless you understand it.

I don't worry about getting nuked even though the government has nukes. 
The existence of these tools is still worrying, but let's be real we all have assumed they've had these tools for ages, this is just confirmation. Doesn't change much now. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 14:14:05
No, I was thinking of this post. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 12:49:29


I can't imagine why. 
[My god. I don't even know where to begin with you. It's like there's so much stupid I don't even know where to start.](
I think I'll start by asking you to bake your head in an oven for the good of humanity, and blocking you so I never have to lose brain cells to your stupidity again. Good day. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 14:21:58
I don't know what's going on but I'd like a response from the mods here 
@_date: 2017-08-23 07:06:30
It’s ok if he bought back in to make up for it 
@_date: 2017-01-02 11:53:02
Or uses it to buy things, just like owning $900 
@_date: 2017-01-22 14:02:51
I'm not sure why it's happening, but all of the comments below this are weirdly disappearing into the wind. There was a strong investigation into how OP was full of shit, with lots of evidence, which he responded to mostly with puffs of the chest and trying to bet people everywhere without a shred of actual proof, and it's all just... gone. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 12:05:28
How about you just post more proof instead of throwing bets around, then we'll believe you. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 12:39:47
I have a cure for cancer. Don't believe me? I refuse to show proof unless you take a $1,000,000 bet with me about whether I'm wrong. 
See how bullshit that is? The burden of proof is on you bro. I couldn't give one half of a shit about whether you're bullshitting or not. Just stating this fairly immutable fact: 
 one should believe you unless you post proof. 
Whether you can do that without being a psychotic asshole trying to take peoples money in the process, is up to what kind of person you want to be. 
The fact that you're coming across as a crazy person is doing nothing to raise any confidence in your truthfulness, as an aside.

So what you're saying is I should buy bonds now and sell them to desperate people running from the stockmarket after the crash

Subscriber only article I'm afraid, god damn pay walls.

That's what they said about Mt.Gox.

Hmm, while all of this sounds good, I would want to know what their positions on current major policy are. Such as taxation, pensions, welfare, aid, etc etc. All of this sounds good, but on the other hand it also sounds like the parts of the libertarian party I like, who with regards to the rest of their platform, I have big issues on major policy with, so much so I can't in good conscience support them. I'm worried it might be the same case here, usually those that push for these positions also hold fairly conservative views when it comes to helping the poor, and I can't support what I like about these policies as the cost with regards to the conservative views is just too high. 
This is *Iceland* however, so I'm hoping they have some fairly nordic countries level of social policy so I probably don't have much to worry about. It's just that articles like this often focus on the flower without looking at the garden, and I can't support a whole party platform on one issue, I need to know how they'd govern as a whole.

The point is they are fully aware that they don't have the money, they wait for sponsors to pay them first and then pay the competitors with that money.
