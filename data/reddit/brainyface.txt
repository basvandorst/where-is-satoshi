That is like HR firing you from your day job, wtf
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:10:47
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:09:44
Safest would be sell cash , put it in the bank , transfer to an exchange and they buy btc
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:08:06
Cant See android
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:31:46
$1,500 hahahahha

@_date: 2017-08-12 18:14:17
How much are you thinking of investing at one go?
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:52:22
Are you trying to buy with debit card?
@_date: 2017-08-02 06:28:01
Already claimed them 
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:13:46
Coinbase and Gdax both working for me
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:36:24
Just curious 
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:35:08
That would be kind of stupid and unsafe
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:20:31
How long will 6 blocks take?
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:04:08
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:56:01
No such issue with me
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:04:34
I believe Coinbase has a higher transfer limit for bank transfers. And IIRC the limit is smaller until they verify your identity
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:08:47
Why not create a Gofund me? and what makes you think anyone will donate to an account with no post history ?
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:55:32
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:55:54
Why can't you join an exchange 
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:58:28
What do you mean by backup Google Authenticator
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:57:20
and which exchange are you using 
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:14:45
exactly my point. There is no credibility 
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:19:34
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:24:38
I use an app called blockfolio
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:30:30
Where did you sell them? 
@_date: 2017-08-02 06:50:27
I doubt they would do that 
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:02:05
Why do you think you should be leaving?
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:56:44
is it pending?
@_date: 2017-08-13 09:43:46
Not true for exchanges like Gdax
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:17:56
Well, Mining isn't an easy thing. You usually need a very powerful system to have a profit. I am guessing if you are mining with a weak computer then it's going to take some time to get rewards (btc) after a while ( could be months ) 
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:29:20
Using Gdax. Opinions?
@_date: 2017-08-17 06:48:36
Coinbase has an option for Google Authenticator only for transactions AFAIK. 2FA for login is either SMS verification and email for device authorization 
@_date: 2017-08-17 06:39:55
If for example, you are using Coinbase and your device goes bust, you get a new device, install Google Authenticator and scan the bar code on Coinbase again to authorize your new GA app 
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:34:19
I think its stuck
@_date: 2017-08-13 10:44:34
Yes 
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:38:10
Any reason why you cant purchase? 
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:01:13
Chances are slim but hey!!! I want to win it. Thank you kind soul :) 
@_date: 2019-08-17 05:41:17
Does anyone know what is the transaction amount for this round?
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:23:52
The account has 8 tweets and 126 followers... I doubt 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:22:53
5,800 now :/
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:59:26
I would suggest buying it from a forum and then making a coinbase account. You can pm me if you need help making one 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:13:12
the CC Fee though
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:00:08
Doubt it 
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:58:37
wire takes a lot of time 
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:20:36
Which one would you suggest
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:29:11
It takes a bit of time to transfer though 
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:57:37
You get equal amount of B2X
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:16:32
look at the charts
@_date: 2018-03-12 14:37:22
Same time as yesterday
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:12:07
The most useless feature on gdax is the 'depth chart'
@_date: 2018-03-29 05:03:06
kinda, not seeing that many big drops .. or maybe I am just used to seeing it go down
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:33:31
My strategy is simple - Buy now, Regret Short term, Be thankful in Long-term
@_date: 2018-03-30 03:48:21
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:43:27
exactly lol
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:02:53
I think only new accounts are flaired
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:11:20
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:08:41
lol truest shit ever
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:07:19
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:08:37
With this rate, I dont see it getting back to 17k anytime soon
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:02:30
8k coming soon
@_date: 2018-03-15 11:28:53
For the same reason people think it will hit 20k soon
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:53:55
Wtf is happening guys
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:17:40
ehh, not really, wont believe this until it reaches 7-7.5k
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:02:13
nope :/
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:41:30
@_date: 2018-03-29 04:56:19
Guys, where are we going? we are just going down at a slow rate, where is the rebound?
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:04:31
to those saying they are out, we went down to 6k and then got back up to 10k . This is nothing
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:49:57
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:12:59
looking at the trend, I doubt
@_date: 2018-03-15 08:46:19
24 hour volume is back to 36k on GDAX
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:01:36
there we go , sub 7500
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:57:27
so I guess all the depth charts don't matter at all
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:52:50
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:12:43
We bounced back from 6k from a few weeks ago, we got this one too.
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:44:07
take advice from a 1 day old account
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:18:08
more like the middle east work up
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:06:43
dump time?
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:07:19
But we already reached 6k and got back to 10-11k
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:45:38
just for today, a few days later it will be 5k
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:49:35
I can't post any text post anymore. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:54:36
wow wow haha

@_date: 2018-02-02 09:31:21
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:23:07
dip? this isn't a dip
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:31:15
at this point, I dont believe in any technical analysis, few days ago people said 7k was the bottom, look what happened 
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:07:44
I will be happy if it just goes up to 8k now, forget 5 figure
@_date: 2018-03-29 12:28:04
I Call 6k
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:04:29

@_date: 2017-07-30 09:45:07
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:01:00
When will the next fork happen?
@_date: 2017-07-10 18:42:27
@_date: 2017-07-30 12:19:33
Transferred out of Gdax, where it shows completed but on coinbase it shows pending. wtf
@_date: 2017-07-30 10:50:21
My transfer on gdax shows as completed
@_date: 2017-07-31 07:28:19
Was wrong. It was showing pending on Coinbase, took 15 hours 
@_date: 2017-07-30 06:56:07
Verified for GDAX
@_date: 2017-07-16 05:21:03
With $100 you won't have a big profit margin. Are you trading on coinbase?
