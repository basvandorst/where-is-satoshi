I'm sure a lot of people experience little to no problems, otherwise nobody would be trading, but then you get reviews like this one for Coinbase: 
"very easy and simple to buy and store currency with coinbased, virtually imposible to get back ... they simply close your account and send a spam email saying they can not tell the reason why .. PERIOD!, and after 10 months later my 12.7 bit coins deposited are simple their propterty ( and worth a fortune today! enough for me to buy a HOUSE in cash with) ... even 3 differet lawyers told me there is nothing i can do at all, and it cost me 4850 to hear their opinion , and took several weeks ... DO NOT TRUST COINBASED ... your agreement with them is simple, they can do anything they want and never have to tell you or a court why ... and if you dont agree to that and dont have millions to chase them down, dont trust them!.. i want to kill someone over this, but who ? what can i do! ? nothing.. just suck it!"

I'm not sure from where the person writing that review is from. I'm looking to get in from Canada myself.

Any issues cashing out with Quadriga? Is it safe for cashing out larger sums or would you break it down into numerous smaller transactions?

Yes but the argument is that's not a viable currency because the price is unstable (even if increasing).

What about the the claim that a good currency needs to be stable? Users need confidence that the money they're paid in isn't going to lose its value. The argument is that Cryptos are so far too volatile to be useful as widely accepted medium of exchange.
