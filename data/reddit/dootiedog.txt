Or, you’re pushing 50 and still have internet access
@_date: 2019-07-18 15:32:51
Omg I totally agree, no offense to anyone out there but it seems like nobody on this sub has a sense of humor other than upvoting a meme about bitcoin going up
@_date: 2018-08-26 01:49:23
Downvote this comment if you think this is just some random guy wanting your crypto 
@_date: 2019-08-03 23:35:00
Yeah, if you want to find out more about cryptocurrencies and just what kinds and how many are out there I suggest you visit CoinMarketCap its a great resource
@_date: 2019-08-03 23:16:13
Hey, welcome aboard! I would suggest you trade some of your xrp for either monero or ethereum, i dont really like xrp but i do think its a good long term investment 
1: you probably know this but stay away from bsv
2: If you ever get into small alts take your profits, its probably gonna crash
3: dont take anyone’s advice as the soul truth, people are biased and some are just plain dumb
4: Never get sucked in by the team’s hype, eg. bitconnect, xyo, electroneum, cardano, 
Good luck(;

It’s bitcoin sv basically created by this guy who is pretending to be Satoshi, craig wright hes been debunked multiple times yet somehow its still a thing,
@_date: 2019-08-04 01:15:14
I just stay away from it because of the stuff that happened early on with iohk and ethereum classic, however it is much better then electroneum
@_date: 2019-06-19 19:35:11
Sorry idk what that is
@_date: 2019-06-04 17:23:03
Yeah I burned it on with the laser engraver I was surprised to see it work myself

Im selling to people who know nothing about bitcoin i dont actually expect anyone pay me with it im just trying to get people to know about it also even if I expected people to pay me with btc I would still price it in dollars because I also accept cash and its not fair to bitcoiners if the price goes up, and i dont want to be constantly printing out price conversions into btc untill we become the world currency
@_date: 2019-06-09 19:04:49

Thanks, and yeah thats true I’m surprised more people don’t just put their wallet someplace and instead go through something like pundi x
@_date: 2019-06-09 19:17:51
You could probably get $25 in btc for it, their cheapest one is $15 and most expensive is $30

I covered it not to look like a beggar, if I would have left it open id get called a beggar wtf do you want from me
@_date: 2019-06-04 17:02:57
Yeah my last post made me look like a beggar so I censored it but believe me it works
@_date: 2019-06-06 21:36:14
@_date: 2019-06-06 22:43:13
Haha no lol its just me selling it I regret putting it for that reason
@_date: 2019-04-14 00:47:53
Thanks i will do that
@_date: 2019-04-07 22:22:54
Actually do this to bitcoin cash or sv they deserve this and probably will fall for it 
@_date: 2019-04-07 22:22:05
Why tf did you expect this to work out
@_date: 2019-04-20 18:41:42
Wow lemme just say that looks great! 
And also its awesome that you’re donating the proceeds to the legal fund, an attack on one is an attack on all.
@_date: 2019-04-07 22:52:17
Oh that’s totally fine it still gets the point across but when you are putting an before a word that starts with a concenent it should be a, like in your case the first an comes before an s so it should be a, instead of an but your second an is correct. Overall good job.  I know some native English speakers that do that too and my grammar is by no means perfect either (:
@_date: 2019-04-07 22:25:10
I actually really like this. However not to be rude but it was bothering me that it said an instead of a
@_date: 2019-05-11 18:22:27

@_date: 2018-12-29 01:12:29

@_date: 2019-05-12 03:21:17
I wasn’t trying to make anything perfect I literally did this in 3 seconds on markup, its an iPhone thing, you seem like an android person
@_date: 2018-12-29 01:43:38
Oh what do you have if you dont mind me asking
@_date: 2018-12-29 02:54:54
Yeah that will be interesting to see what happens when i was really little I remember my dad cashing out on his silver when i was like four during the last recession and i hope to do the same with crypto 
@_date: 2018-12-29 02:48:52

@_date: 2018-12-29 03:52:08
Haha thank you
@_date: 2018-12-29 02:47:29
I think bitcoin is great because its better than fiat in almost every way since it is not controlled by any one corporation or government and this far has been shown to be impervious to hackers and even though the bitcoin market is volatile in the long run i could almost guarantee you that your bitcoin is going to be worth way way more than if you were to store some fiat unless there was some major emp that wiped out most of our power grid and tech but if that were the case we would have bigger problems.  i also find the idea of mining to secure the blockchain intriguing.  And with the max amount set at 21,000,000 over inflation is impossible.  My final thing i like about bitcoin is that it is infinitely divisible so is way more precise than usd.  And this also means that when btc gets up to $1,000,000 normal people will still be able to afford using it. But i like to think that at some point that we wont need to worry about how much it is worth in usd and all stores accept it and the usd will be left behind so bitcoin can be what it was meant to be
