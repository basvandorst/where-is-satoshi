I just want to point out how pathetic you sound. It's like you can only express yourself with insulting others.
How hateful you are doesn't impress others, it defines you.

We have a representative saying he looked at his account and is verifying details of a personal hack through a public forum. If anything, this verifies OP's story.
As someone who experienced bank fraud this week, I'd be livid if this same scenario occurred there. Blaming the user without additional evidence outside of a two factor auth is a problem. The IP could be privately shared, this could be referenced to see other accounts it accessed, an investigation could be made to view the IPs accesses in his Google account to confirm no one was inside...but no.
It doesn't matter if OP is correct, the proper way to handle this wasn't taken. If there is a hack it will go unexploited and protected by this community until it is too late.

Yes, you all learn to think like sheep and ignore the desire to question, especially when it would take two seconds to share. So smart!

What is sad is when adults associate degrees with something they've done. You see, you didn't do anything but follow an obstacle course built by smarter men, wandering in the preset lines until your handlers slapped your hand to get back on trail. The main ingredient is time (aka money), so it is a luxury not created by you. Mommy and daddy own you and toddled your way into the college playground, helicoptering from nearby.
Using a course level to tell others they're ignorant shows that you don't realize that you've never done anything worthy of note. You clutch to your expensive piece of (PhD dropout) paper and scream about its worth, wondering why no one cares. You won't do anything either, because you never learned how to do, just follow lines. Now alone on the Internet, hoping for some level of respect.
Six years ago a leading Nobel prize winning economic theorem was lauded as hard science. Strange how it caught them all by surprise as it fell apart then no? Sheep, everyone, just like you.

Must not be yours then sheep.

OP isn't trying to cause a problem, OP is sharing his experience. This experience is troubling and should worry others if OP is in fact correct.
This is like blaming the person who points out a bank is insecure because the vault door is unlocked.

Providing this info in a public context *is not appropriate*. These are the very forms of customer service that scare folks away from Bitcoin.
