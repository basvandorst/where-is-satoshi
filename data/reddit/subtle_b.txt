My understanding, and very layman's here, is that there is 1 right answer to every block, and whoever hashes out that answer first, gets the block reward. The increasing difficulty of each block makes it harder and harder to solve the block. 
Probability is involved because no matter how many hashes your machine can solve per second, you are still just basically trying to guess some lotto numbers. The more hashes you can solve per second, the more lottery tickets you have. 
Eventually, if costs were cheap enough, why wouldn't I want my own lotto machine/money press in my office? Especially if I am already using bitcoin on a daily basis. I dunno man, you say I need to read more about bitcoin and probability, I would appreciate it if you'd tell me exactly what you mean.

At 1 btc = 1million usd the difficulty will obviously be much higher, will at 800kh processor still be able to solve the hashes at that point? Will it be able to process the already solved hashes in time to even use that information before the next hash is solved? I am asking because I honestly don't know, does it even work that way?

I can't, and I don't have any money in BFL, so I'm not even vested in this thing. I'm just pointing out if any human I've ever done business with was BFL... they would be mining the shit out of some bitcoins before they mailed that equipment, maybe only run each machine for 1 week or something... but that's still a lot of money to turn down, and it would appear to be free easy money. People are greedy and mean and selfish and I just can't imagine most people mailing a 'money tree' to someone else before growing themselves a little money first. Even if the CEO of BFL (I don't even know if they have one) is the most upright guy in the world, he has employees and such. "Yea boss, miners need just 1 more week before shipping" The guy who tells the boss that, maybe he's mining? 
I don't know, and I can't prove it, but from what I know of humanity, people, from what I've experienced..... well who the hell sells a 'money tree'?

I've been reading a lot of your comments all over bitcoin talk here, you apparently think a 51% attack is like a joke or a 'possiblity' or something that isn't REALLY going to happen? Why are you so nonchalant about the whole damn thing? From the very very beginning of bitcoin, a 51% attack has been the largest threat. 
Edit: Also, fuck your throwaway. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 16:40:49
Sounds like a wise decision. I was just thinking how a 51% attack seems less liable because of mutual assured destruction of the value of everyone's bitcoin. You've reminded me that some people just want to watch the world burn.

Mining may not be a requirement to use Bitcoin, but mining is a requirement for bitcoin to work, and mining has to be done by somebody, so if mining is completely and totally unprofitable, bitcoin will die eventually. I would assume that eventuality will be when mining is no longer profitable for the people currently doing it.

It couldn't possibly be a MORE profitable venture. The equipment they are giving you for a fee does nothing more than make money. If you can make money after paying their fee, it is 100% true that they can make more money by taking your fee and using the free money making equipment themselves. 
If their motive is to make as much money as humanly possible without worrying about their customers... they are most certainly using that equipment before they ship it. Also, haven't several people received miners already set up and with addresses belonging to BFL set in the software? I don't have a source, because I'm 100% sure I read that info on reddit and it was just some redditor complaining about it. 
Source or no source, they make more money if they use the equipment first, then sell it.

Man.. there isn't like a bitcoin college you can go to and get a formal learning process in bitcoin. It has been around like 5ish years. In two year people are going to start trying to recruit senior bitcoin miners with 8+ years experience manditory for a starting position in their new bitcoin operations that they have no idea about. 
My point is this is a new and difficult to use/understand completely thing. People arn't going to soft spoon it to you like windows or something that's been around for 20 years. You really want to mine or learn how to do bitcoin stuff, this could be a future job. It's going to take a lot of effort.

So... obviously at 1BTC = 1 million USD the difficulty is going to be much higher... would you still be getting $300 bucks a day once the difficulty  is so high? With a difficulty that high would it slow your equipment so much that it can't even process old blocks before the new ones are solved? I have no idea. :/

Lots of businesses provide products that other people use to make money.
I agree, but none of them as 'effortlessly' as bitcoin mining. Once you've created the miner, all you have to do it plug it in, configure it a bit, and watch it make money. If it was't the fact that every little miner is essentially a 'money tree' I wouldn't be so quick to doubt.

I don't know where Inglewood is. I think the only safe thing to assume is that this person's life is going to change dramatically at least for a little while, if he is Satoshi or not. 
I also think it's pretty safe to assume, as I said initially, that if the number of coins that Satoshi originally mined were lost forever, or were even ***moved***, it would have an enormous impact on the Bitcoin market as a whole. 
@_date: 2014-01-01 18:26:51
Should I wait until next Monday to ask this? My line of thinking is that if you were a business and you wanted to disrupt another business's bitcoin mining operation, you could take our their power, or their internet connection, how hard would it be to attack a single building containing 100 bitcoin mining servers, if they all use the same internet connection. Is that feasable? I know the blockchain and some of the blocks are getting big, but how much information is passed between the P2P network and each individual miner. Am I asking stupid questions? :/

I am on drugs, but not the kind that would confuse me about this. Somehow the miner has to be configured to deposit bitcoin rewards awarded during mining. I don't own any miners so I'm not familiar with that process. 
It was my understanding that some miners when shipped were configured with a bitcoin wallet address belonging to BFL. That was all I remember reading, and like I said earlier, I don't have a source on that, I read that here on reddit as someone else posted it.

Mining isn't profitable at all? I understand that you can't mine without ASCI miners, but even those are a losing money? I assumed that as bitcoin grew and grew, and became more accepted, small business would NEED their own servers for maintaining the block chain and processing transaction, I assumed that eventually once everyone starts using bitcoin day to day, they are going to say... "Why don't I have a miner in here too?"

Yea, I guess I should have phrased my question better. 
1.) Can you see a future where bitcoin is so fundamental to our society, and the price of bitcoin is so valuable, that mining will again become profitable?
2.) Is it possible for the equipment to become faster/better in such that a normal person can begin mining? 
3.) What kind of investment does it require to begin making money while mining? Currently it appears that even if you buy a 20,000 gig/hash machine you will just lose money? Once the miners equipment dies, won't they have to buy new equipment, and if they never make money off the equipment... eventually they should go broke, or wrong? Where is the break even point of 'expensive high end gear'? I've played some of the gig/hash to difficulty miner calculators and all of them come up as losers to me, what am I missing would be the better question. 
4.) At some point will it be feasible for a NATION to invest in bitcoin mining?

I'm just thinking outside the box, honestly, for my own creativity. I'm working on a short story, and trying to get a much better understanding of bitcoin in the process, combing the two makes it more fun I guess. 
Why would they attack miners and not Bitcoin directly? I was thinking more like, would there be a way for for a disgruntal NSA agent with the kind of unlimited access that some agents have, what ways could he steal someone's bitcoin other than the obvious(keyloggers and just copying their wallet file would work wouldn't it? Presumably if you access your wallet on a compromised system/any iphone, they would have access.) Or lets say the NSA is directly targeting an organization (terrorists) they could just take all their funding in one swoop, or anyone they perceived as a threat. Unless cold storage. 
Dropping packets won't do anything. Miners will just buy some mobile 4G hotspot and use that. - Right, but if you used a landline that was subverted by someone who was working against you, anyone, could they use packet sniffers to target your mining results, and then just drop them from the line before they were transmitted, how effective would that be? If that was going on, and you were unaware, wouldn't your equipment keep working like nothing is wrong? 
It's cool if you don't' have the time to answer these off the wall hypotheticals.

That's the part that confuses me. Each machine has a cost, and each  machine has a capability, if you are in a mining pool and receiving monies based on our machine's output... it shouldn't matter how many  machines you own, 1 or 100 either they are all profitable or they are all not profitable, why isn't it profitable for someone to buy 1 mining machine and hook it up instead of 10?

@_date: 2014-01-01 18:29:49
That's kind of what I was thinking. No matter how many miners you have, if you have a single point of failure... -shrug- Do the miners keep resending results if they are wrong?

There are 100 different things GHash could VOLUNTARILY do to lower their % of the hashrate. The thing is, they have no intention of doing that. At this moment they have more control over all the bitcoins in existence than anyone else in the world, why would they give that up?

I showed him the transaction in the blockchain, but blockchain.info isn't really just accepted as fact by paypal and ebay.
