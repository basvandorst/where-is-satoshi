So... Cool story bro.
A friend of mine tried this out. (Out of curiosity, not ill intent).
He came across a certain page with a login and "knocked a few times"
Username: "root", password: "password" -&gt; "No account"
Username: "admin", password: "password" -&gt; "Password Error"
After a few times the system locked itself, so at least it's not likely to be brute forced. But the next step would probably be to run a port scan of this IP.
BTW, you don't need blockchain.info to get this information. You can easily get a list from peers.dat or "$bitcoind getpeerinfo" and script a spider to do the same thing.
I mean, don't do it. Because if you do you are a bad person. But if you happen to be a bad person you can do it.
@_date: 2014-10-26 02:24:33
1) open bitcoin.conf
2) add the line:
    walletnotify = ./path/to/script.py %s
3) here is a sample python script.py to get started
    import sys
    if __name__ == '__main':
         should be the transaction ID
         sys.argv[0] to query bitcoind via bitcoin_rpc
        
         you can do other things, the following will email you the transaction ID whenever a wallet in your control recieves funds
        s = smtplib.SMTP('localhost')
        s.sendmail("bitcoind_bot "youremail sys.argv[0])
        s.quit()
4) See [JSONRPC]( for more information.

There isn't much to brag about at this time. Like I said, it's in heavy Alpha.
At the minimum it functions as a RESTFUL API abstraction to the blockchain of (potentially) every cryptocurrency.
A more common usage would serve as a private, personalized blockchain.info clone.
I plan to have frontend clients which securely communicate and act as a "Wallet for power users" Platforms targeted will be Windows, OSX, Linux, Android, IOS.
The ultimate goal is that you should be able to install Ubuntu Server with a handfull of extra packages and this should have greater security than simply running bitcoin-qt on your workstation. 
Like I said, this is in heavy alpha, not much to brag about. But here are some features in the pipeline...
* 100% free and open source.
* Standard features found in most wallets
* Perform all actions and capabilities of the RPC-API with a user friendly interface.
* Blockchain explorer
* But wait... There's more!
* All hardware and software is 100% controlled, changeable, and audit-able by owner.
* Manage multiple cryptocurrencies (Not just bitcoin, but for instance, Bitcoin AND Darkcoin AND Bitcoin-testnet) from the same application instance.
* User / group permissions to allow / restrict specific people to specific accounts / actions. (For families / businesses) For instance, Carol from marketing can create new addresses in the "Marketing" account, but can't spend the funds without premission from the quorum. Or Little Billy can see and spend from "Billy's allowance" but can't see or spend from "Little Jessica's account" Dad can do whatever the fuck he wants.
* Multiple Factor Authentication to access accounts.
* Restriction to specific networks (If required)
* Encrypted data transmission.
* Warnings for administrators notifying of "poor security practices" and steps to correct them.
If anyone is interested, I want to release a beta around New Year's-ish. I'll probably throw it up on Github.

Just [configure]( bitcoin-qt to redirect through your Tor stream instead of clearnet.

@_date: 2014-10-26 17:55:48
walletnotify is a configuration setting of bitcoind which tells bitcoind to run an arbitrary script you designate whenever an address in your wallet sends/receives funds.
The script example I provided is something you are going to have to custom write yourself. But if you have the transaction ID you can generally use JSONRPC to query bitcoind for more information about that transaction ID. For instance, Amount recieved / sent, transaction address, etc. you can also use it to create new addresses and automate sending of funds.
You will probably want to change some other settings configurations as well. For instance, you may want to set up a specific bitcoind user account and run it as a service for security and stability reasons.

As Kleptography applies to this particular case: SHA256. I don't see it as a significant problem because the SHA256 algorythm is a completely open standard, extremely well known, and thoroughly scrutinized.
If someone wants to claim there is a back door in SHA256, I ask them to demonstrate it. Like it was done with Dual_EC_DRBG. If it is possible, it should be trivial to do so. The best cryptographers and hackers have tried and failed to find a backdoor in SHA256.
Kleptography is a greater risk in closed systems where the algorithm can't be scrutinized, but this does not apply to SHA256.

the "NSA" thing is a red herring that trips up paranoid conspiracy theorists, but people who actually understand math what is going on here know better than to freak out abou it.
The purpose of the constants is to provide a common framework by which to calculate proof of work. It's neccessary for everyone to be on the same page here.
For instance, let's solve a simple problem. For the sake of simplicity we are going to do common addition instead of SHA256.
The problem is as such: Find an answer which equals 10:
The "NSA supplied constant" is 2:
The algorythim is: x + NSA_C = 10
To solve this problem everyone would break out their "super abucuses" and start brute forcing until a solution is found. Obviously the answer is 8, but if we were using SHA256 the answer would be less obvious, right?
But back to your question... What if we were to change the constant to 7? x + NOT_NSA_C = 10. We'd get a completely different answer than before, 3. Right?
But, everyone is using the NSA_C, so when you submit 7 for proof of work, everyone does the math with THEIR NSA_C constant and tells you to fuck off because 3 + 2 != 10, YOU FUCKING IDIOT!
TL;DR: The constant exists for the purpose of standardization. It's not a security flaw.

bitcoin.stackexchange.com isn't really a good fit as it tends to be completely ask/answer without room for a lot of discussion of the meta-development process in general. For instance, posting white papers is not allowed, but I think it important enough to have a dedicated and maintained sub-reddit.
I'm going to start adding development journals to as I learn. Maybe once a day or so. Hopefully I can attract enough people who are interested. It seems the other bitcoin-dev subreddits failed because they didn't attract enough users for "critical mass". Probably due to lack of interesting content.
I'd like to have a "Dr. Dobb's Journal" for bitcoin.
Kind of like "Hey, I'm going to stop over to to learn something useful. Oh, hey this guy is asking a question, and I know the answer. I'm going to help him learn too."

The risks come from humans making stupid mistakes. The Bitcoin protocol itself is safe.
So the question really isn't "Is Bitcoin safe". The real question is "Am I responsible enough to have and keep my money."
Think of it this way. Do you keep cash in your wallet? There are almost no security features protecting that cash. Yet, you still use it despite the risks, right?
What about credit cards? Whenever you use one, you are giving someone permission to take as much money as they want from your account. Hopefully they are honest. But despite this, you still use a credit card, right?
You are already taking greater risk with your money now than if you were to start using Bitcoin.

^ This is your problem. I can't tell you how many times I've turned down equity. For the guy offering, it is a good deal. But for the guy doing the work it is too risky.
It's kind of like: "Hey, instead of equity, why don't you give me full pay so I can invest it in a flexible way? Maybe I'll even recycle some of that cash and buy some of your equity by my own free will. Maybe there are better investments out there I'd rather focus on. Ever hear of this new fangled nerd currency called Bitcoin? If you can guarantee your equity can outperform Bitcoin maybe I'll consider it."
You'll have a hard time attracting smart people with equity in an unproven company. Why? Because the smart people have been there and done that and now they know better.

The difference will come from the legal nature of the situation.
Legally, Hollywood has a somewhat legitimate claim in combating piracy. I personally don't agree with it. But I'm not a judge, so my personal opinion doesn't count for much. But, I digress. Regardless, Hollywood can protect their interests by targeting specific pirates.

You are confusing rights with freedoms. Freedoms are natural. Rights are securities backed by the government.
When someone says "I have a RIGHT to blah, blah, blah" it means there is a piece of paper somewhere that secures that person's ability to do that thing and the government will acknowledge with that right.
Freedoms are different because there need be no paper. You just fucking do it because you are free. No asking for permission, No asking for forgiveness. Government doesn't come into play.
This is the difference between rights and freedoms.

Whining about it some more should solve the problem OP. Just keep on whining and everything will turn out fine.
I mean, we could talk about other solutions. Like creating incentive for people to act as you wish. Or we could encourage the game's dev to implement some security features. I mean, you'd think that if the game dev didn't like this behavior, he'd at least add captcha or something.
But, we can't do that because that would actually require some effort. Whining about it is much cheaper and when it inevitably fails it feeds right back into the Social Justice Warrior's persecution complex.

Or, instead of whining about it. A person could approach the problem from a position of power and actually accomplish something.
Suing the police for stealing a Trezor is approaching the problem from a position of power. There is likely to be a beneficial outcome due to perusing that action.
Whining about people playing a game is not approaching the problem from a position of power. OP is whining and it's pathetic. Why? Because he's approaching the problem from a position of weakness. Nothing is going to change because of his actions.

It depends on how far down the rabbit hole you want to go.
There isn't anything specifically which will do this out of the box. So, some programming is going to be needed to verify the points and initiate the transaction. A RESTFUL application layer is probably best for this kind of thing, so Ruby + Rails / Python + Django / PHP + CakePHP, etc.
Then look up [JSON RPC]( You can integrate this into your RESTFUL backend pretty easily. All you need is a bitcoind node running as a daemon / server.
Python + Django view example: (Has many flaws. This only covers HOW to use the API. Not security in general. Think before using)
    from bitcoinrpc.authproxy import AuthServiceProxy
    
     contains get/post information passed in the url / http headers: 
    
    def get(request):
        rpcuser = "someone"  ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
        rpcpassword = "somepassword"  from ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
        node_ip = "your_bitcoin_node_address.com"  IP Address
        access = AuthServiceProxy("
        btc_amount = get_users_points(request.GET.get(user_id))
        access.sendtoaddress(request.GET.get(btc_address), btc_amount)
That's it. Easy.
Some configutation of your ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf file will be required to act as a RPC server and to allow connections from your RESTFUL server.
Don't run your node and RESTFUL server from the same machine if possible.

The "Founding Fathers" were fallible humans... this is an interesting realization you have made. Maybe you should continue down this path a little more?


No, you are ignoring the fact that rights require some form of state acknowledgment to be recognized as rights. They also require some form of state to be enforced. Freedoms have no such limitation.
Another way to look at is is, Freedoms have no cost, while rights do. For instance, I have the Freedom to arbitrarily kill someone while at the same time, I do not have the Right to arbitrarily kill someone. The Freedom to arbitrarily kill someone is inherent in my ability to do so. While my Right to arbitrarily kill someone is restricted by a cost, (Which is the security, in turn, not to be arbitrarily killed).
So we can say that Rights are securities which come at a cost of freedom. (Freedom to kill, Freedom to retain taxes, etc)
You can argue semantics and summon dead politicians all day. Fact of the matter is...
Freedom != Rights
The fact that the founding fathers had to spell this out in the constitution is admission to this. If they were talking about rights as if they were freedoms there would be no need for this.
Freedom is the ability to act regardless of the state.
Rights are actions which are supported by the state.

From the demographic polls I've seen there is a gender disparity in the Bitcoin community. Not that they were perfectly scientific. It was just a poll. But I didn't see any pressing reason to argue with the [data](
The real question we should be asking ourselves is: "Is this really a problem?"
Even if there is a discrepancy between the sexes, there isn't any barrier to entry for females. It's a matter of personal responsibility. If a female isn't interested, she isn't interested and that is her choice.
@_date: 2015-02-15 02:40:00
Because Bitcoin doesn't have any quotas for "female types". 
Furthermore, there is no barrier to entry based on sex and no-one is preventing "female types" from participating if they want to.
Ultimately, for whatever reason, "female types" (as a general statistical trend) aren't interested in Bitcoin. It's a matter of personal responsibility and that's perfectly fine.
@_date: 2015-02-15 03:08:53
^ This is really something you should be asking "non-participating" females. I can only tell you why I like bitcoin, and it really has nothing to do with the fact that I am a male.
To ask me why females don't get into Bitcoin is kinda like asking me why others aren't into "sexy librarians" I don't know. I like sexy librarians. I think everyone should be into sexy librarians. But I can't tell you why some people aren't into sexy librarians. You have to ask them.
But if you were to ask "non-participating" females why they aren't into bitcoin? It would be like asking me why I'm not into balloon fetishes. Fuck, I just don't get balloon fetishes. Don't really care to get into it either. It's a matter of personal choice.

Ask yourself if you should be playing Blackjack or any other risky venture.
Do you have $1000 that you could lose and not be pissed about? That's the mind set you should have when gambling. Go into it with the expectation that it is somewhat likely that you are going to lose that money. Then bet what you are comfortable with.
If you need that $1000 don't do it. If you can afford to risk $1000 at a Blackjack table then you can afford to risk it playing the market.

Well, if a US company like Blizzard for some reason wanted to hop on with a model like this, I'm sure they wouldn't be able to hide the fact that these transactions were happening, so there would be legal ramifications.

LOL! Man, that guy is awesome! I'm not being sarcastic here. I want to live in Bitcoin town.
I kind of get the feeling he learned about civil development by playing Sim City while high on pot though. Which would also be awesome.

There are two ways to go about this.
1) Allow players to deal with each other directly.
2) Put their BTC in "Game Escrow" and let the server handle the transactions.
Option 1 would invite all kinds of scam artists. Looking at EVE as a model we already see option 2 pushes the limit of acceptable scamming, so I don't think option 1 would be very inviting.

Personally, if I'm going to follow through with this idea, I'm going to have to keep it simple. I don't really have the time to develop a FPS like counter strike, so mostly I'm looking for simple ideas myself.
But, I opened this up for exchange of dialog and sharing of info, so if anyone wants to tackle a BTC FPS please do so!

But do you get to buy and sell spaceships (or other game items) for profit too?
Sure you can play the market with bitcoin, but you're not really "Playing The Market", now are you?

It's funny that you say that because I happen to live in Utah. I think Utah is plausible as a staging ground for such an experiment because of its somewhat Libertarian nature and access to land for such a development.
Unfortunately, the fact that the state has legitimized Gold and Silver sets a precedent which could allow it to legally legitimize / delegitimize other form of currency. It may be the case that by default Bitcoin can't be considered legit simply on the basis that it hasn't been recognized, like Gold was.
I can imagine a bill would have to be passed before Bitcoin could be accepted in any governmental transaction at least.

Good point. Any solutions?

Having played Magic I understand and agree with what you are saying.
I think the issue of having a good game and the desire to incorporate BTC are separate problems though.
I'm just looking for scenarios which the two concepts would work well with each other.
Also, if you think MTG is a well balanced game you weren't playing during the Mirodin and Urza's Saga eras LOL.

Let's face it. Bitcoin is probably going to have this reputation for a long time. We can let opinion cripple us or say "Fuck it! For all intents and purposes this is money and your opinion doesn't matter!"
Compound that with the fact that a person can cash out of said game and go buy something else and it really can't be considered "Game currency" like WoW.
It's better to have bitcoins circulating in an actual market as opposed to simply traded back and forth on the exchanges for shits and giggles.

He probably isn't an attention whore. Why would he want the attention really? It's not going to bring him profit. All he needs to do is anonymously sit back and watch as his creation rises in value. Then, retire rich and no one's any wiser about it.

I hate to poo poo an interesting technology like that, but here are my thoughts.
1) Long distance radio technology requires a great deal of power, probably more than you are going to harvest from solar panels. (Which would also require a great deal of upkeep)
2) In stormy weather with large waves, your line of sight is gone.
3) If one node is destroyed/sunk/goes offline/pirated/etc, the entire network will go down.
I'd hardly call that robust. When you have an economy dependent on 100% up time it leaves some doubts in my mind about the practicality of it.
Anyway, feel free to set me wrong.

It doesn't have to be just US law it could be any market.
America is more than just 5% of the gaming economy though and if you want to legitimately target that market (Like a large corporation might), they are going to have to play by the rules of the country they are registered in.
One might say, well, just find a gambling friendly country and set up there, but you could still be putting your users in jeopardy.

I'm thinking that to combat the cash out deflation issue: All items would have to be short lived, perishable, or tradeable.
Also, the number of existing items would have to reflect the amount of coins in the system at all times.
We need a professional game economist for this one...

Being a hacker is a badge of honor. Whether it is used in a positive or negative context, it implies l33t skillz.
It took l33t skillz to build Bitcoin, a common developer could have never done that.
@_date: 2013-04-29 20:08:53
Yeah, I agree. This probably wouldn't work on a game with award drops. EVERYTHING would have to be exchanged exclusively P2P. in other words,  no server generated rewards.
I don't think that's really a bad thing, but it changes the kind of game someone is going to build.

Obviously, this is a hypothetical situation, so it's difficult to go into fine grained detail about the situation as it applies to state and county law when there is no specific place in mind.
I would be curious to find out what specific states / counties would be receptive of such an experiment though.

I did not know about Ithica's currency. But a quick search didn't reveal any information about the Ithica governments acceptance of it.
In my town there are no city taxes. However, things like water, sewage, garbage disposal are billed by the city monthly. The city collects taxes by means of the county passing on the city's share of property taxes and the state's collection of sales tax. So, taxes are not really an issue, but it would be nice to pay for utilities, business licences, etc. to the city in Bitcoin.
As I understand it, the woman who lost her house to the fire, her house wasn't within the city limits. Residents who lived within the city were covered, so I presume the costs for that were not voluntary.
I suppose it would be tempting to simply not to incorporate the land into a city, but the thought experiment would be lost at that point. It might be an interesting idea for a Libertarians, but probably wouldn't appeal to people / businesses who are interested in overall stability as opposed to the Wild West.
This isn't really supposed to be about Libertarian ideology. (Or, any other ideology for that matter) It's just a thought experiment to see what it would take to build something that resembles an inclusive, organized town/city with Bitcoin as a major player in the overall economy.

Here's a thought. Find a string of oil rigs which either already have internet and broadcast from there, or offer to finance their internet by building a network between them. You could set up shop on the edge of the farthest rig.
That would solve the power and stability issues and the rigs are probably high enough that line of sight isn't an issue in rough seas.

I was thinking something similar. Like a classic PvP JRPG battle coliseum.
Both opponents buy a character for .25 cents (or such) that puts .50 in the pot. House takes 1% winner takes the rest.

It does make a difference. The "Investors" are also people who potentially want to include bitcoin in retail. 
Let's say you sell a widget for $10 equivalent in BTC. Someone buys your widget with bitcoin. You have essentially invested in Bitcoin at this time.
Now a period of time passes, but the market has dropped significantly. Now your BTC investment is worth $8 (from $10), but it cost you $9 to make that widget. You just lost money because of market volatility.
I don't think this is really a problem for people willing to hold on to their coins in the long term, but for businesses who have to cash out in order to make payroll every couple of weeks this could be a big turnoff.

Eve online seems to self regulate pretty well. Despite the bots. The market is big enough that the players treat ISK as if it were real money anyway, so I personally don't think it would be much different.
It might also be interesting to have a "Bot Circuit" to encourage those who DO write bots to enter there and compete against other bots.

Elaborate? How would you like the economy of a FPS to run?
