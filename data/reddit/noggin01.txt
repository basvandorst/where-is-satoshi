Right, but if the data is encrypted, you add the salt to the raw data and then encrypt it.  You shouldn't ever see the salt as it should be encrypted along with the rest of the data.
In this case, the salt is "Salt__" and was added before base 64 encoding.  This is not even slightly effective.  Unless it's simply a key word that informs a program that the encrypted data that follows has salt in it.
But this is inconsequential to the task at hand I believe.

Thank you.

Thanks.  A new wallet.dat file created by Bitcoin-qt is 96KB, so I figured this one was not a wallet.  I can see him creating a file named bitcoin wallet to impress his friends (he was relatively young) but I don't see him going through the trouble of creating a base 64 encoding of encrypted data to make a fake file.
Just realized that it is a little bit odd that Salted__ was not encrypted with the rest of the data.

I understand your skepticism.  You're right, this doesn't need to be a priority, and honestly, it is not.  I found what might be a Bitcoin wallet and tried to restore it, but it didn't look like it would work with Bitcoin-qt so I came here and made a post.  
That said, I got his laptop, and the only partition is a version of linux called Parrot and is asking for me to enter a decryption key on startup.  I don't expect to get into his laptop.

Thank you.  I'll keep this in mind if his laptop doesn't work out.

I stopped working on it.  As someone else pointed out, his parents didn't really care.  He was too young to have gotten involved before the price was really high.  It is unlikely that he put more than a few dollars into it, and he was too young too have been able to get into it before it was already high.  I stopped working on it and just spent the time with my family.
