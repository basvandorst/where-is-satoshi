Sure...but there is never a guarantee that prices will keep bouncing around as much as they have in the past. You say to yourself "I'm buying back in when it hits 3k"... and then it never hits 3k. It just creeps up and up...you've fucked yourself. 
@_date: 2019-09-23 04:50:27
I'm pretty sure you meant 42 million millionaires (as of March 2019).
@_date: 2019-09-26 17:31:56
That's ridiculous...why would moving "any of it" crash the market?

Or he's just dead.
@_date: 2019-09-28 14:50:47
Notice one of the choices isn't "Stocks".
@_date: 2019-09-26 14:37:26
My assumption at this point (since there has been zero activity) is that he's dead. And since we don't even know who he is I can't give to his family (which I would have). So now it's mine. I wouldn't cash it out...that would crash the market and I wouldn't want to to that. I would take some out. I would also start donating to good causes.

No...they would give you your money if you requested it. Only if there was a "run on the bank" (everyone requested their money), would they be fucked. But of course that's ALWAYS true, since banks loan out your money.
@_date: 2019-09-30 17:40:03


Of course in that case (in the US anyway), your money is federally insured and you still get it back...unless you have more money in that one bank (currently $250,000) than is insured.

Exactly...this quote makes no sense in relation to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:55:35
I almost never check the ticker ever. Only reason I know it was going up is from reddit posts. I have a few Bitcoins that I've been holding for couple years (bought before the big jump in 2017/2018. It could hit 25k... I'm still not selling.
@_date: 2018-12-16 17:43:49
Historically

@_date: 2018-12-25 17:59:06
I would agree with that. I'm also on hormone replacement (Testosterone) and on the sub reddit for that. T replacement is mostly for men over 50 but the reddit is FILLED with 20 somethings that want to start injecting themselves...it's nuts.
@_date: 2018-12-16 17:47:02
Reading is fundamental. He didn't buy Bitcoins...he bought altcoins.

Got to be one of the biggest douche bags on the planet.

" When I say old people i mean people over the age of 60."
I'm glad you qualified that because I'm in my 50's and own Bitcoin (and some ETH and Litecoin a couple shitcoins). ;)
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:51:21
I'd forget about it until at least 2021. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 19:14:14
Which is why you can't just read the title before replying. He says "For clarification, I ''invested'' , read -gambled- most of that $ on other coins, not bitcoin"
@_date: 2018-12-26 19:56:34
Funny...because crashing to 3k is still not "tulips". 
@_date: 2019-07-19 05:10:45
Only problem is you only know if you bought the dip and sold a peak in hindsight.
@_date: 2019-03-02 14:51:49
I'm confused...so bankers can't stop Bitcoin because it's all fake and they are in on it?
@_date: 2019-11-01 13:17:41
Sweet...me next.
@_date: 2019-08-16 17:00:01
I personally don't know anyone who hates Bitcoin. Most people I know have no opinion on it at all.
@_date: 2019-08-10 18:21:21
I never understood the HODL license plates...if you bought the car you clearly didn't HODL. Now a BTC plate I get.
@_date: 2019-08-10 18:24:15
I'm currently close to 10%.
@_date: 2019-08-06 03:13:03
That's certainly one theory.
@_date: 2019-10-05 05:49:50
What percentage of your investments would that be? If it's more than 10 I think your insane...and yes I  own bitcoin. But if it does crash I won't be crushed by it.
@_date: 2019-08-25 15:04:01
Nope...I still like cars and watches and pinball machines...and fitness equipment and...
@_date: 2019-10-17 03:38:27
Yeah...I'm getting ready to pick up some more.
@_date: 2019-10-17 17:54:52
I'm more with Raster here. 15k seems WAY more likely than 1k. 1k would essentially spell the end of Bitcoin at this point in the game. 15k could just be a Friday.
@_date: 2019-10-09 21:46:13
Nope...it's just a Wednesday.
@_date: 2019-08-13 01:01:58
That's an extremely specific number...what a bunch of douche bags.
@_date: 2019-10-13 22:39:44
You would have to reset the value of the dollar...and in that sense everything. New cars would have to go back to like $2500 and brand new homes to $40,000.
@_date: 2019-10-13 15:32:05
Besides all the advice already given (do your homework), I think everyone should own some BTC. As a hedge if nothing else. I wouldn't put more than 5-10% of my investments in it...depending on your level of risk taking.
@_date: 2019-10-14 03:05:52
That would be great for anyone holding actual gold ��‍♂️
@_date: 2019-10-11 17:45:42
Well you hold "thousands of dollars worth of BTC" just by holding 1.
@_date: 2019-08-06 03:00:36
Explain? I never said I hated fiat...I said that's one theory that gets thrown around on why people preach holding. Everyone here is "speculating" on crypto...unless they truly believe it's the future of money and that that will happen well within their lifetime. Otherwise, you are speculating on crypto.
@_date: 2019-08-05 19:20:51
I have to think that's a VERY small number.
@_date: 2019-10-18 03:16:31
Yeah...well, like that's just his opinion man.
@_date: 2019-10-03 14:25:55
Just because it was so easy to mine them early on...you could do it with a laptop and essentially for free. Buying them was actually more difficult.
@_date: 2019-08-28 04:56:22
If anyone ever contacts you on reddit regarding your Bitcoin...it's a scam. (Period)
@_date: 2019-10-03 02:07:48
Buy Apple, Amazon, Google, Netflix....etc...sell right before the crash and then rebuy at the new lows...sell at their ATH's and then mine Bitcoin on your gaming computer as soon as its possible. Hell...set up a server farm right from the get go.
@_date: 2019-10-03 03:41:34
Good point.
@_date: 2019-10-05 18:55:42
The only way that's true is if Bitcoin only ever goes down in value vs fiat. If it replaces fiat then we have made LOTS of money.
@_date: 2019-10-21 04:42:52
Better question: "Did anyone actually ever believe in this or any other prophecy? "
@_date: 2019-06-24 19:27:54
I own some of both gold and bitcoin but I'm a bigger believer in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-05 14:10:41
@_date: 2019-10-12 03:43:51
Great...except BTC in never going to $2600 again, so I guess he ain't sellin' shit.
@_date: 2019-06-04 15:33:39
Panicking? I didn't even notice.
@_date: 2019-02-22 21:58:52
I get them every week...people actually paid on these? Unbelievable... I should have gone into the "scam" business...apparently it's just too easy.
@_date: 2019-10-27 03:53:46
That has pretty much been my mindset from the get go. Just enjoying the roller coaster ride.
@_date: 2019-06-01 23:23:09
So what does acquiring it under 4k look like?
@_date: 2019-08-02 21:34:58
I couldn't give a flying fu*k about what those two douches think about bitcoin...or anything really.
@_date: 2019-12-11 21:06:58
Selling? I'm thinking about buying more!
@_date: 2019-04-16 18:58:18
Another way is to buy shit using Bitcoins...I do that all the time (and I'm 52).
@_date: 2019-04-04 17:04:35
Meh....wake me when it crosses $25,000.
@_date: 2019-04-20 14:40:23
Well that money is safe.
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:59:37
10k is not the moon.
@_date: 2019-04-20 14:44:47
Sure this kid exists. :/
@_date: 2019-04-15 14:54:39
Thank you captain obvious (in this case WikiLeaks) for the newsflash.
@_date: 2019-01-04 21:16:53
Now you got it ;)
@_date: 2019-01-05 03:24:59
And had he invested at the top he would have lost most of his investment. He'd have maybe 200 million of his 1 billion left.
@_date: 2019-01-07 02:12:09
Got mine brand new sealed from Amazon for $38 
@_date: 2019-01-05 16:47:48
You did great...congrats.
@_date: 2019-01-07 04:12:22
I'm worried this much................0%
@_date: 2019-01-05 18:00:01
Thanks...not worried at all.
@_date: 2018-11-19 04:28:52
On paper?...about 15k. No plans to sell though.
@_date: 2019-01-05 06:26:28
Look, I own Bitcoin... my point was it's a stupid argument/article. You could do this with anything.
@_date: 2019-01-02 02:17:08
Honestly, no one knows. It could go to zero or it could go 250k+. Impossible to say. If you put a gun to my head and held on long term then I could see it going to 100k. Some people think it could hit 1 million some day. Then you need to know how much is enough to retire on. 2 million? 4? If we pick 2 million then that's anywhere from 2-20 coins depending on how lucky you feel. (Could also go to zero).
@_date: 2019-01-05 06:22:07
Not if you live in the US.
@_date: 2019-01-05 16:49:09
I don't think that means what you think it means. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 23:25:55
I'm 51 and not only hold Bitcoin but have used it for purchases. Not only that but unlike 98% of crypto holders I also hold crypto in a retirement account. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 03:05:20
Sure...but trying to predict the top and buy at the bottom is not so easy as you make it sound. If it was we'd all be rich. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 20:45:21
I wouldn't...in fact been there already and didn't sell. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 22:06:11
More apps are nice but I'm fine with how my S works. I don't need a Bluetooth connection to my phone.
@_date: 2019-01-02 15:33:07
Just bought mine for $38 off Amazon.
@_date: 2019-01-05 16:38:12
You guys are funny. Say it shoots up to 10k right now (over several days). There is no guarantee it's ever coming back down to 5k. So if you sell when it hits 10 with the plan to buy back in at 5 you may have just fucked yourself. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 20:47:44
Why? It's not over yet.
@_date: 2019-01-07 06:56:52
Love you to.
@_date: 2019-01-03 21:01:16
@_date: 2019-01-03 22:11:26
Yes I will... because I own both.
@_date: 2019-01-06 23:23:05
@_date: 2019-01-03 19:27:52
maybe...always best to be diversified.
I have stocks, I have crypto, I have gold, I do loans on Prosper and I'm getting involved in rentals.
@_date: 2019-01-02 18:30:38
Yep...it was fully sealed. I even updated the firmware. It was all good/legit. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 00:53:05
Enough for what?
@_date: 2019-01-02 01:50:45
Again...that's very vague and also arbitrary. If you're one coin goes from 4k to 25k is that "Big financial gains"? If we are talking "retirement money" then I'm pretty sure one coin will never ever get there.
