I highly doubt that Bitcoin will fulfill the hope of "digital gold", which implies stable and ideally rising prices, without any other underlying demand-creating use case, such as a widely used payment system. If you remove the P2P payment part, the core premise of Bitcoin that brought most early enthusiasts into the fold, you also pull the rug out from underneath digital gold.

Depending on when you split, most likely you don't have much reason to regret so far, do you? 
And even if you were unlucky enough to buy at a peak, remember that can and does happen at Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, stocks, forex - basically anything that's market traded. There are people who bought Bitcoin at &gt;20k a couple days ago and I'm sure some regretted it. You could have bought Apple stock on the evening of Dec 18 and immediately regret it the next morning. Doesn't mean Apple is a ripoff and a bad investment long-term.
Speaking of long-term, I have more confidence in Bitcoin Cash than BTC as of now, simply because it has a use case outside of speculation and BTC doesn't. I also have some issues with it though and so am even more confident about other coins, that similarly have real-world use. Won't say which, lest I'm accused of shilling. Just saying it's worth doing some research on the top 10 coins and spreading instead of just splitting.

LN doesn't work without segwit anyway, so that's a given. But sadly, that won't change thing on the fee side once adoption picks up even a tiny bit.
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:49:31
That's the end game. How long do you think it will take to get there? 
First we need LN available to the general public. How many more months? Don't forget, LN has been promised and used as excuse to block any other interim scaling solutions [since Feb 2015]( It's only been three years.
Then you need your coffee shop and your clothes shop and everyone else to adopt it, open LN channels and interlink with each other for your scenario to work. How long for that? If it's any indication, how has businesses' segwit adoption curve worked out so far?
The scaling problems are here and now.
The other thing is that "always have a single lightning channel open" changes the entire paradigm of using cryptocurrencies. Who will I have that one single lightning channel with? A bank? Visa? Coinbase? Replacing a trustless decentralized system with a single central entity controlling the on/off ramp and therefore "everything you want to buy", that's not what I got into crypto for.
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:18:38
Oh, Coinbase? The company that this entire sub here was frothing at the mouth about leaving, canceling accounts, never using those a*holes ever again? That one?
Besides, if your "solution" is to maintain an open account with one central entity, then I may as well keep using my bank account and Visa card. That's not what I got into Bitcoin for.

Sorry for the late reply. I'm not on Reddit every day, but wanted to come back to you.






Come down from your high horse. I have a full-time job and a family to care for. I don't have time to go through months-old Reddit archives to find a whole list of examples for you. Here is one more that I only remember because it was a [direct response to one of my comments]( and turned out so spectacularly wrong. The OP this was posted in is a nice example too. But yes, in retrospect, putting the link was a mistake. I should not have put any link at all and just let the statement stand on its own. I just realized you're a mod here, so I trust you know very well what the general sentiment was here around Aug 1. 


I don't care much about rbtc either, and I'm not sure why you bring another sub into the discussion. Both places are childish often enough, one perhaps a bit more than the other. Whatever. There are other places to discuss Bitcoin freely in all its forms with more mature people. 
And you know what I found interesting there? Nearly everyone, who is into Bitcoin Cash today, started out with Bitcoin. And this year they decided to move away from it. For many, incl. me, this was a difficult step. But those folks were some of Bitcoins earliest and strongest supporters. People who didn't tire to explain the technology to others, started businesses, lobbied for merchants to accept it, formed meetups and actually *used* Bitcoin whenever possible. Now they are rooting for another camp, whether it's BCH or one of the other alts that pursue what Bitcoin originally was meant to be. I find this very regrettable and a significant loss for Bitcoin.
Now look at Bitcoin today. Nearly all the newcomers, who replaced those who left, care about one thing and one thing only: price. Bitcoin's original use case thrown out the window, replaced by a nebulous notion of "storing value" without any other utility of the coin. Price, price, price. When to get in, when to get out. ATH, hodl, get rich quick. Just look at your own response, how you immediately chose to cling onto the side aspect of BCH price development from certain entry points, when my actual point was that Bitcoin Cash is not a scam.
Personally, if you had told me at the beginning of the year, when I was 100% in Bitcoin, that I'd hold less than 10% in BTC by Dec, I'd have declared you nuts. Only a small share of the 90% is Bitcoin Cash, I preferred to branch into other coins that so far have served me well. But the thing is, for me, sure it's nice to see my early play money grow into a nice nest egg, but ultimately price is one of the most boring aspects of a coin. I get excited about the prospect of having true peer-to-peer electronic cash for everybody not just those who can afford $20 transaction fees, about the technological progress, about the implications it may have on society. I want cryptocurrencies to change the world, not just get rich quick myself. 
And when I look at the Bitcoin Cash community, I see those ideals again. There is a vibrance, the drive to break new ground, genuinely wanting to build things. The enthusiasm from Bitcoin's early days is back. 
Long story short, whether you look at the BTC/BCH ratio from launch on August 1st or from "the August 1-7 pump", fact is, BCH is far from a scam or "deceiving the unsophisticated fools". In fact, the people I've seen getting into Bitcoin Cash are anything but "unsophisticated fools" and the "bcash", "scam", "fraud", "Chinese centralization" etc. narratives so freely thrown around here seem like textbook Orwellian agitprop to me, designed to create FUD and solidify tribal boundaries.
You keep regurgitating people "have fallen prey to malicious misinformation, and that makes them victims", without showing what damage those people might have suffered. If anyone bought the peak and sold the dip, as you seem to imply, that's nothing unique to Bitcoin Cash and hardly makes it a "fraud". Peaks and dips happen in Bitcoin too, frequently and pronounced. Each time, there are people who get burned, it's part of getting involved with highly volatile cryptocurrencies.


Fine, I'll humor your hairsplitting one last time. Bitcoin Cash was launched on Aug 1. What CoinMarketCap lists before that date, were futures that two exchanges offered before the coin existed. Sure you could gamble on futures, but if by "it" you mean the actual coin, "it first started trading" on August 1. Before that, nobody had any to even fulfill the futures contracts!
Picking the launch date is a perfectly reasonable choice, as opposed to selecting "the August 1-7 pump" and claiming anything else would somehow be embarrassing.


Don't get ahead of yourself. Luckily, there's a tool you may have heard of that allows us to get a decent grip on that number. It's called the blockchain. It shows about 24 million addresses with any balance on it. About 15m of that contain dust that hasn't been moved in a long time. Most users have more than one address. So divide the remaining 9m further by whatever you deem appropriate and you get to a number somewhere in the low single millions for ALL existing Bitcoin users as of today.
Oh, but what about all the Korean haraboji who just opened an account on Bithumb to get rich? In a way, that kind of goes to the whole dispute between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. I wouldn't call them "users" if they don't even have a single address of their own and their only purpose is to gamble on an exchange. You perhaps prefer to call them "storing value" and using "layer 2 solutions". The future of Bitcoin! But even if you count them in, they won't be tens of millions since August. Not even close.
I realize that's just a tangent, far from the main point of our discussion. But you want to come across so high and mighty and as a mod of "the largest online Bitcoin community in the world", as you pointed out, you should have a better grip on some elementary Bitcoin facts. Otherwise - how did you so eloquently put it - "you *really* don't want to play that game. You're embarrassing yourself."

Ah yea? Here's my result of spending the time to think through LN:

Ha, you proved my point again. Price, price, price. And not just that, no - price today, price since last week. Ha. Short term tunnel vision. Prime example of what Bitcoin has become.
And FWIW, I mentioned it already, I keep a share in BCH, but the bulk of my holdings is elsewhere. I'm much more interested in how that pans out in the **long** run and I'm willing to take an informed risk on it. Let's talk again in a year or two?

According to  the exchange rate on April 24 opened at $231.34 and closed at $230.99. Even if we take the more expensive price, the 0.02136182 BTC you received were worth $4.9418 on the open market. You paid $5 for them - a 1.18% surcharge. 
Not too bad, but also not free. Which is not surprising, since Bitwage as a company needs to make money *somehow*. I just wish people would stop falling for the "0% fees" ruse. Oldest trick in the book as any airport currency exchange booth can tell you.
@_date: 2015-06-08 01:28:48
It'd be good if they listened to the emails and bring it back. 
But I'd assume that they base this decision not on the number of emails they get, but on the share of revenue Lieferservice had in BTC compared to other payment methods.
@_date: 2015-06-23 12:30:09
The blockchain only records transactions, but not balances.
To get the current balance of a specific address, you have to parse the entire blockchain for transactions involving that address - which can actually be done surprisingly quickly.
@_date: 2015-06-14 02:58:08
No, I'm not "trying to determine **if** BitWage is hiding some premium in their pricing". That's a given because, as I said, BitWage isn't a charity. They don't charge an explicit fee, so if they didn't build a margin into their rates, they'd go bankrupt. Quite simple.
I happened to use Bitstamp as an example to illustrate how this works because some people earlier in this thread seemed to be blinded by the "0% fee" marketing ploy.
If you want to understand how much money Bitwage makes, the only rate that matters isn't a Global Weighted Average, but the one they are actually buying their bitcoin for. Which, as you said, we have no clue what it is. But it's safe to assume that they will try to maximize their profit by buying as cheaply as possible, probably by having accounts on multiple exchanges or even private deals with miners and buying wherever it happens to be the cheapest at the moment.
If you want to understand how much of a premium you pay as a consumer for the convenience of using Bitwage services, the only rate that matters isn't a Global Weighted Average, but the one you could actually buy your bitcoin for elsewhere. For some that may be Bitstamp, for others Circle, Bitfinex, Kraken, Huobi or who knows what else. Some of these companies may even be more expensive (Coinbase?), but if you do your homework, you will almost certainly find a place to buy cheaper than from Bitwage. It doesn't matter if that place has 50%, 5% or 0.5% of global volume. The only thing that matters is "Can I safely buy the bitcoin I need there at a lower price?"
That price difference is your opportunity cost of using Bitwage services. The Bitstamp example served well to illustrate that point and I stand by it. Instead of shouting with your "?!?" and "Who the hell", perhaps you can take a moment to think about it. If you still don't get it, I can't help you. In any case, I'm done here.

I don't know if I'd call it mindless to object to something that takes my rights away I'd otherwise have.
Keep in mind I don't object at all to **voluntary** arbitration. There is nothing wrong with it and if both parties see benefits in it and prefer it over a lengthy court battle - good for everyone.
I'm talking about **forced** arbitration, where as a consumer I irrevocably sign away my right to a proper trial or a class action, no matter what, and without even knowing it (in most cases, since people don't read TOS). 
Which is also a convenient way for the company to keep dirty laundry hidden since arbitration results are typically not public, unlike court documents.


Yes, and that is exactly part of the problem as it creates a conflict of interest for the arbitrators. To get more business in the future, it's in their best interest to keep the the entity happy that pays them - THE COMPANY.
@_date: 2015-06-13 04:13:41
Note of caution: 
There is a [Mandatory]( [Binding]( [Arbitration]( clause in their [Terms of Service]( at point 13. That means you give away your right to sue them if ever any disputes with your paycheck arise. And no, forced arbitration is NOT a good substitute with the odds stacked high against the customer, see links provided. 
I try to avoid those as much as I can. Closed my Coinbase account after they updated their TOS and introduced this.
@_date: 2015-06-13 06:50:34
Did you read the links I posted?
*"According to the complaint, National Arbitration Forum (NAF) arbitrators ruled in favor of California consumers in less than 0.2% of all cases (30 out of 18,075) heard from January 1, 2003 through March 31, 2007. These 30 victories only occurred in hearings where a consumer brought claims against a business; when companies brought claims against consumers, they were successful in hearings 100% of the time."*
Please explain how this is better than a court would be.
Here is some more food for thought:  
If mandatory arbitration was indeed "much, much more individual-friendly", then why do the companies who force it onto people not advertise it all over the place as a benefit they provide? Instead they hide it in a long piece of legalese that hardly anyone reads, the TOS, which quite clearly shows they're hoping to "get away with it" rather than doing something good for the consumer.
@_date: 2015-06-13 05:29:42
You don't just wanna look at any explicitly stated fees. Look at the exchange rate they use. It's super easy to offer "0% fees" when at the same time they hit you with a bad rate.
I don't wanna hold it against them that they make money on these transactions. After all, they aren't a welfare institute. I just wish these types of companies were more upfront and transparent about where and how much they charge you.

Re Paypal's "No fee for you. The seller pays the fee." This is little more than window dressing. In any two-party purchase transaction, there is one buyer and one seller. ANY money involved in this transaction in any form will ultimately come out of the buyer's pocket.
When I wanted to buy a house, I was balking at taking a buyer's real estate agent and was told: "Oh, don't worry the seller will pay the broker fees!" And who pays the seller to pay the broker?
The seller isn't in it to provide public welfare, so any third party costs, fees, commissions, client dinners etc. will ultimately add to the price you pay as buyer. The link between e.g. a Paypal fee and the price you pay may not always be so direct, but the thinking goes that over time, competitive pressure will lead sellers to pass on savings from things like bitcoin through lower prices.
As for Paypal specifically, I stopped using them years ago, but I believe when you move money from Paypal back to your bank account, they do charge you a fee, even for a private account. So if you want to get your money back, it's not really free even for you.

Came in to comment on that too. Current market cap is calculated as 
    current price on exchanges x number of all bitcoins in existence
But as you point out in 2.) trading volume is small and falling and the market cap calculation extrapolates from that small subset to all of bitcoin. It's misleading as it makes some people assume this is the "paid in" value of bitcoin, but in reality, that is MUCH smaller than $6bn.
On the other hand, as rezzme pointed out, much of bitcoin is not for sale at the current price and if you wanted "to buy the entire currency outright" you'd have to dish out MUCH more than that to convince people like me to sell.

Conveniently, those discussions and posters could then be banned as promoting "altcoins".

Yes, you can lose a trademark if you don't use it, don't defend it or even if it becomes a generic term. Which is why, for example, Google actually doesn't want people using "google something" as a generic verb for "search" - even if the search is done on Google.

Even if you *think* you can pick a good arbitrator with the help of a lawyer *and* the company doesn't object, the entire arbitration process is stacked against you from the get-go, see my earlier post.
Don't get me wrong, arbitration can be a good thing, *if it's voluntary*. But just ask yourself: Why would a company force you into *mandatory* arbitration via an obscure phrase in their TOS, if it wasn't purely in their own interest?  If it was something good for their customers, don't you think they'd shout it from the rooftops? 
So, no, still not a good system.

Me and a friend have been mulling over creating a local trading site similar to tradebitcoin.com, but specifically for the Chinese market. Since bank deposits to exchanges here are banned, there is a higher demand for cash transactions between locals. This would be a great incentive to finally get started. We'd use this for development, but try to host the live site somewhere closer to China. (Within China likely impossible due to ICP licensing requirements)

Look at China. A bit paradox because it's of course one of the most dictatorial governments on earth, while at the same time, despite calling themselves "communist", you have almost completely unfettered capitalism. Environment, food safety, labor standards exist only on paper, oversight is almost non-existent and companies can do pretty much what they want. This is the result:

Preposterus answer: No, I don't see a problem.
OK, let me qualify a bit and I'm genuinely curious about your response, not because I think "I gotcha", but because I think this a worthwhile discussion and I'm open to any ideas that challenge my view.
The common argument against deflation, and the one you made above, is people will stop buying things, consumption will drop, companies will go bankrupt, people will lose their jobs and then we're all doomed.
So, it's not good. Not good for our economy. 
But what if you take a step back and examine whether our economy itself is actually that good a thing? 
The current system, encouraging people to consume more and consume it today instead of tomorrow, IMO leads to very undesirable side effects when you consider society and humanity as a whole. Planned obsolescence, conspicuous consumption, a value system based on material possessions, rapid resource depletion, environmental destruction etc. 
Example: I read a while ago one of the fastest growing industries in the US was self storage because people buy and keep so much stuff they have no actual use for. There's even a [TV show about peoples' abandoned crap](
You said further down in your dialog with that an economy's most precious resource is capital. I'd actually side with your opponent on that one to say that things that are inherently finite (crude oil, copper, raw earth minerals, silicon etc.) are more precious than an artificially created entity (money) whose supply can be controlled by an institution.
And indeed, we go to ever-greater lengths to extract from earth the precious things we so desperately need to keep our economy humming: deep sea drilling ([Deepwater Horizon anyone?]( fracking, deforestation, etc.
The [dictionary defines "economical"]( as *"marked by careful, efficient, and prudent use of resources :  thrifty :  operating with little waste or at a saving"*. Our current "economy" is anything but economical.  It's wasteful, destructive even. An ever-accelerating process of converting resources into trash. Maybe via a few intermediary steps of recycling (which is almost always more a down-cycling actually), but ultimately, what once was a raw resource turns into trash and pollution. I don't even want to think about what that means once billions of more people in China, India, Africa start consuming the same way most Americans do.
On this background, I ask: So what if a deflationary system puts the brakes on this madness?
I'm sure there is a better way, where people still have access to all the things they need and live happy and fulfilled lives. Maybe not by prancing around in luxury cars and brandishing the latest-season Gucci purse, but by doing things they enjoy doing - sports, arts, scientific exploration, spending quality time with good friends, travel - instead of slaving their lives away trying to acquire enough funds to keep up with the Joneses.
I'm fully aware that this sounds VERY utopian and I don't have a clear answer to what exactly such a better system would look like, how resources would be distributed, and how we could get there from here. But I'd appreciate your thoughts.

The assumption goes that by then, and hopefully much sooner ("all the 21 million bitcoins are created" = year 2140), Bitcoin has gained such wide acceptance that transaction volume is orders of magnitude higher than it is today. (Still need to solve the 7 tps problem for that to happen, but that's a different story.) The total transaction fees generated throughout the bitcoin network would grow proportionately and replace, maybe even exceed, today's mining rewards.
So miners have an incentive to stay. If some of them drop out, difficulty would be lowered and rewards for the remaining miners would increase. Mining should in the long run always reach an equilibrium where income roughly equals cost.

It amazes me how short-sighted people can be with these things. Coinbase is not a welfare institute. No, they don't pay the transaction fee for you. I mean, they pay it for you using your money, but not if you imply they somehow save you money. Coinbase is a business; do you think they have money to give away for nothing in return?
No, of course not. For every transaction that involves a conversion from or to fiat, they give you a worse rate than any real exchange like Bitstamp or Kraken. Say, a merchant wants to charge $30, Coinbase will tell you: "0.062 BTC please!" when on any normal exchange those $30 would be 0.060 BTC. That's on top of the openly disclosed 1% fee they charge a merchant for processing or you for buying / selling BTC.
Sure, then they pay 0.0001 BTC transaction fee "for you". Great deal.

**Mycelium in China**
I live in China and use Mycelium as my main mobile wallet. One big problem here is that all [Google services are completely banned]( Not just the search engine, but entire IP ranges. Analytics, calendar, GMail, the Play store - everything is blocked. Many sites use Google-hosted scripts and fonts and they break when accessed from China because the scripts never load.


I'd love to help test in China, but you see now why this is a problem. But it's not just Orbot. When I access your local trader function, for example, I get: *"Your device cannot integrate with Google Play Services, and may not get automatic notifications when trade updates occur."*
When I hit OK, and try to enter my location, the auto-locator doesn't work. (*"This feature requires your device to be able to tell its current location. It seems that your device cannot do that."*) Trying to type in Shanghai manually also doesn't do anything. It just sits there with the typed word and nothing happens. I assume it's supposed to pull up a list with suggestions as I type, but that doesn't happen. I suspect this is because it relies on some Google service.
BTW, the ban does not only apply to Google, but many foreign sites. Torproject.org is of course blocked, as well as all publicly known Tor exit nodes. The government also runs deep packet inspection and can recognize Tor traffic. When you connect to a private, hidden exit node, it may work for a couple hours, but within a day that node will be added to the block list.
You can access foreign sites through "stealth" VPN services (many normal VPNs are also blocked), but they cost money and require extra setup steps, so most Chinese don't bother.
At the same time China is a huge market and Android (scrubbed of any Google services) is by far the most popular platform. It'd be great if you could offer a solution that works in China.

Somebody you exchanged an email with, recently also searched for "how to blow up Boston Marathon". Since in your world all searches are public, this gets picked up by the NSA (even though in reality, they couldn't do jack shit to prevent that event despite their massive "necessary to prevent terrorism" spying). Now, by association, you're a suspect too, whether your own searches are innocent or not.
Because *somebody else's* searches weren't private, *you* will now enjoy the loving care and embracement of your friendly NSA protector, taking a closer look at your email, phone calls, Facebook posts, even [postal mail](
You may say "So what? Even with those, I have nothing to hide." Until you have to answer funny questions the next time you try to board a flight to Boston. Or you get put through an extra [audit by the IRS because you were a tea party sympathizer]( Or an Occupy participant.

If you're in the US, Charles Schwab is the way to go. I know it's heresy to praise a bank here on a bitcoin forum, but I have nothing but good things to say about them.
Use absolutely EVERY ATM anywhere in the world without any fees, whether explicitly charged or hidden by exchange rate. I have used those shitty private ATMs inside bars and clubs that charge $3 or so to get money to pay your tab and Schwab reimburses me. I have used random ATMs in places like France, Germany, Thailand, China and yes, Japan (OP), checked my bank statement against the official rate on [Oanda]( and Schwab's rate is within ±0.1% everytime. Yes, sometimes they gave me even a slightly better rate than what Oanda was showing for that day! Love it.
They also have excellent and knowledgeable customer service who speaks proper English, not some dipshits in a random outsourced Indian call center.
Last not least, I've been buying BTC on various exchanges incl. Bitstamp, Coinbase and unlike another large US bank...

I had a business law class in college and if I remember correctly (it's been a couple years), cash banknotes and coins are fungible items, i.e. they cannot be differentiated from another and therefore if you loses them, you cannot legally claim them back and if you find them, you can keep them. Note, this applies to pure cash only. Different story if it's in a wallet.
I know banknotes have serial numbers, but nobody keeps track of the serials of the banknotes they use, and even if you did, just knowing a serial number would still not prove that you're the legal owner of that bill. You could've spent it already.
If you think about it, that's really the only way it makes sense. Imagine anyone could just walk up to a Lost&amp;Found and claim cash. Impossible to prove ownership.
That law class was not in the UK, but I'd imagine they similar laws there, which means the lady was most likely wrong.

Read the three links. It is a bad system.
The arbitrator is usually chosen by the company. And arbitration is a business, as opposed to a civil service provided by the regular judicial system. The arbitrator gets business from having the company's cases referred to him/her. This will almost certainly bias the arbitrator in the company's favor.
[Example:](  
*San Francisco filed a lawsuit alleging that one of the nation’s major arbitration providers operated an "arbitration mill" that favored debt collectors. According to the complaint, National Arbitration Forum (NAF) arbitrators ruled in favor of California consumers in less than 0.2% of all cases (30 out of 18,075) heard from January 1, 2003 through March 31, 2007. These 30 victories only occurred in hearings where a consumer brought claims against a business; when companies brought claims against consumers, they were successful in hearings 100% of the time.*
In this particular case, their TOS say: "A single arbitrator will be appointed by the AAA and approved by each party." Good luck when the company knows how to pick arbitrators (who all want more  business from the company) and you don't.

You're thinking too small. Any business *in the country where the customer's fiat currency is based* can do this manually. 
Now think of a business in, say, Bangladesh selling something to a Mexican customer. They accept payments in Mexican peso, but the Bangladeshi company probably doesn't have a Mexican bank account to receive peso to manually take them to a bitcoin exchange. Credit cards may be a solution, they convert currencies for you. But chances are the Mexican customer doesn't have one. And credit card processing is expensive or even impossible when your business is based in some developing country.
Receiving peso via a processor and paying the merchant in BTC would be a great solution in this case.
And yes, automatically &gt; manually.

Unfortunately, when you design financial systems, they have to (or at least should) be bulletproof. "Ah, don't worry about it, that's very unlikely to happen!" is not good enough. A recipe for disaster, actually. As long as a user can send payments manually, some will, and of those some will make mistakes. Guaranteed.

[I actually do]( just not via Bitwage. But I'm in bitcoin for like 15 min or so - as long as it takes for the destination exchange to accept my BTC deposit. The rate changes during that time are negligible. Sometimes I gain a bit, sometimes I lose a bit - it evens out. And overall this has still been cheaper and faster than any other way I tried before.

I was pretty excited when you first launched. I'm on a long-term overseas assignment, but remain on US payroll as full-time employee. I've actually been using bitcoin to fund my local bank account for rent, living expenses etc. This would be fantastic to streamline things.
The reason I won't use your service is the **Mandatory Binding Arbitration** clause in point 13 of your [Bitwage User Agreement]( There is absolutely nothing wrong with voluntary arbitration, but *mandatory* arbitration is hostile against your customers. Unfortunately, it's one of those things most people don't pay attention to, even though they should. So more and more companies feel they can get away with sticking these clauses in their TOS.
However, I do pay attention to these things and I avoid companies who force arbitration on me wherever I can. I'm not planning to cause trouble or file frivolous suits or anything, but in the unlikely event that something does go wrong (esp. dealing with my salary in the scam-ridden world of Bitcoin), I'm not ready to give up my constitutional right to a proper trial. I'll be happy to keep converting my income manually.

Nobody says that "a less shady way of doing business is bad". Problem is that a) this doesn't only affect the scammy ones you describe but also perfectly legit businesses. Take e.g. Audible or Spotify, they give you the first month for free and if you don't cancel, they charge you a monthly fee and b) if a merchant runs his business this way, shady or not, he will simply not implement Bitcoin and that hinders Bitcoin adoption.

You can't/shouldn't automatically send it back to the originating address. There is a chance the payment was sent from a temporary throw-away address that the user doesn't actually control. Some exchanges and web wallets do that. Not that you SHOULD do e-commerce transactions directly from an exchange account (withdrawal as payment), but since nothing prevents you, some will.
Also, you may be over-estimating the ability of some users to install browser plugins. ;-) My mom wouldn't even know what that is. Or they use public or other peoples' computers.
Yea, finding ways to handle a faulty payment reliably and automatically at the payment processor would be the jackpot! 
@_date: 2015-01-21 03:03:16
To be honest though, even at $10, you're still making a gross profit on that piece of plastic. At least you should, or you're doing something wrong.
Of course you still have to pay all your affiliates to plaster the net with "One Weird Trick", but those payments only come due after the customer ponied op for the full $70. So either way, no whining about "risks" please!

Another problem you didn't mention, but your site demonstrates nicely, is the inability to do trials, subscriptions or rebills.
Argue all you want about the morals of luring buyers in with advertising a low "trial" payment, hoping that many won't notice the fine print that says they will get re-charged a month later for many times the trial payment if they don't return or cancel the product. The reality is that many businesses, incl. large, well-known ones operate that way.
But with Bitcoin you have no choice but to charge the entire amount upfront. If I want to try your snoring aid, I'm $9.95 out of pocket today if I pay by credit card and $62.91 if I pay by Bitcoin - despite the 10% discount.
In fact, a curiosity click on the Bitcoin logo with the 10% offer will alert the buyer to the full price of the product, may make him think twice and cost you the credit card sale you'd otherwise have had.

True, but this thread comes from a merchant perspective. And if merchants refuse to implement Bitcoin because it doesn't support the way they'd like to run their business, then what good is that ADVANTAGE to the end user?
@_date: 2016-03-13 14:10:15
I'm not sure what you're referring to with "second", i.e. where you start counting, but owning bitcoin definitely makes you a stakeholder (a person with a vested interest). Technically you are also holding a share of all bitcoin, but people tend not to use "shareholder" in this context since it can lead to confusion with the common understanding of shareholders as part-owners of a company. Bitcoin isn't a company. You wouldn't say you're a shareholder of the Euro zone either, just because you have a few € in your pocket.


It's not so much a BTC *alternative* as an upgrade of the same system. It's not just "based on the same idea (blockchain)", it actually *is* the same blockchain. In terms of doing more comprehensive things, well, the proposed changes would enable it to keep doing what Bitcoin was always meant to do - process transactions for everybody. The current implementation includes an arbitrary limit (small blocks) of how many transactions can be processed. As Bitcoin adoption grows, that limit has been hit against several times already, yet the current core bitcoin software development team refuses to raise it, making many people very nervous and upset. The alternative, whose name is not allowed to be mentioned here, proposes to raise that limit (big blocks). That's what's represented in the comic by the figures holding large and small boxes. So if by "more comprehensive things" you mean allowing more people to have all of their transactions on the blockchain, then yes, you're right. If you mean more fancy things, that Bitcoin can't do today, then no, that's not what the alternative is about.


Definitely not the main alternative being discussed all over (not in here though, just mentioning it can get you baṇned here). Would be curious who "the guy" was. Do you have a link to the video?


The debate isn't reason for concern. Debating different viewpoints on how to move Bitcoin forward is good and healthy for the ecosystem. Too bad it's forbidden in this subreddit.


Assuming you were referring to the Ethereum market cap. It's the trajectory that counts here. Ethereum has been getting much stronger over the past weeks, as it seems by absorbing capital from Bitcoin due to the artificial limit. I haven't moved any of my funds from BTC to ether yet, but I'm concerned and watching closely.

The current Bitcoin implementation includes an arbitrary limit of how many transactions can be processed. This is know as max block size. The Bitcoin network generates a new block of transaction data roughly every 10 minutes. All transactions worldwide during those last 10 minutes should be included in the block. But currently, blocks cannot be bigger than 1 MB, and if there are more transactions than fit within 1 MB, we have a problem.
There are two competing proposals to solve the problem:    
1) Allow bigger blocks.  
2) Reduce number of transactions.
The "lightning network response so scalability" is 2). It means to develop new software, called "Lightning Network", which moves many transactions off the blockchain into so-called sidechains. The Lightning Networks would be operated and controlled by companies or other entities who can implement their own policies and fees and they would only occasionally settle their balances on the real blockchain. 
1) would be a very simple change in the code. The downside is that it puts higher bandwidth requirements on the miners who produce the blocks. This puts miners with connectivity problems (e.g. those in China) at a disadvantage and it drives up cost for mining, which may lead to fewer people mining.
2) requires entirely new software including solving hard theoretical problems. It works with the assumption that keeping the block size limited will lead to higher Bitcoin transaction fees as people try to get their transaction included. This in turn would drive more transactions off the blockchain and onto the Lightning Network. The companies running a Lightning Network will then somehow derive enough benefit from it so that they have no problem paying high transaction fees to settle on the blockchain.

If a crypto ecosystem is capable of serving the demand of millions of new on-chain users, there will be businesses and enthusiasts among them who can and will run full nodes even if it's expensive. The percentage may be small, but the absolute total in this scenario will be higher (i.e. more decentralized) than at a crypto with limited processing power.
If a crypto ecosystem is not capable of serving the demand of millions of new on-chain users due to limited processing power, then demand &gt; supply means transaction fees will go through the roof and many users will be priced out of the system.

Also, as for the Bitcoin Cash example, it has actually [recovered very well after that spike]( and continued a general upward trend. In fact, over the last month it has been a better investment than BTC despite BTC's recent gains. If speaking of the peak of the spike, "people didn't believe that the price could be sustained at this level" is true - such very sharp spikes are often followed by immediate corrections. But sometimes it's just testing new limits, people eventually get used to the new level and the "normal" price catches up with previous spikes. Seen it in Bitcoin many times.
However, it's also worth noting that liquidity spikes are not a one-way street. They can easily go the other way if there's a large seller in an illiquid market.

It can't be fraud when there's no victim. Who's the victim?
Bitcoin Cash doesn't have segwit, as you point out, and so no Bitcoin Cash wallet will let you send a segwit transaction. There is also replay protection between the chains. I haven't seen the other poster, but I'm not sure how this would work.
In any case, I don't see the name as problematic. Nobody around here seems to have a problem with Bitcoin Gold or all the different "dollars" in the world. And as I said earlier, I don't know anyone who bought BCH by mistake, thinking they are getting Bitcoin. Maybe it happened somewhere, but even if, it's not nearly as big of a deal as some people make it to be.

The first post I responded to by Lejitz was claiming that Bitcoin Cash is "deceiving the unsophisticated fools" and is "scammers trying to steal their money"
That narrative, often regurgitated here, doesn't fit reality and I backed that up with data. So, no, I'm talking about an "unsophisticated fool" swapping all his BTC for BCH on day 1 and hodling. Or got "deceived" into buying BCH instead of BTC. The fool would have ended up with 50% more today than the "wise" guy who dumped his BCH for BTC.
Whether it remains that way remains to be seen, but in any case, I fail to see the fraud, scam, or stealing.

If you want to call me wrong, perhaps you should check your facts first. Bitcoin Cash was launched on August 1. [One BCH cost 0.10 BTC]( Follow the orange line. As of today, you have to pay almost 0.16 BTC for one BCH. Data is from coinmarketcap.com, look it up yourself if you don't believe it.
Since inception up until today, you'd have done better with BCH than with BTC. It's a fact, sorry. To be precise, you'd have almost 60% more if you held BCH than if you held BTC since Aug 1. You didn't need to time a pump, you just needed to keep your BCH after the split.

It's quite easy to understand: Rewards and credit.
Airline miles, gas discounts, cash back - endless options. Sometimes up to 5% in certain spending categories such as groceries or dining out. Sure, you pay for your own cash back with higher prices across the board, because the credit card company takes the money from the merchants and they build it into their price calculation, but that's not as visible. And if you don't get a discount for paying cash, it's a pretty strong incentive to use the card.
For others it's the buy now, pay later feature, when esp. in the US many people don't pay off their balance in full every month and use the card as an open credit line. Which it is, that's why it's called *credit* card. Even if you pay off in full, your bill won't be due until a month later, which is basically an easy way to get a short-term 0% interest loan.

It won't.
I mean there are solutions. But they won't get implemented. Read up on block size war. 
The big hope now is that at some point all those transactions will move off of the Bitcoin blockchain onto the Lightning Network and Bitcoin will not be used by the masses, but just become a settlement layer for big players and lightning hubs. Naturally, there are different opinions about this approach. Do your own research!

Seems we agree then. :-) The origin of this thread by bearCatBird was that small blocks are necessary because "bigger block size means more bandwidth, more storage space, more processing power needed to verify, newer hardware to manage this".
Those hodlers among us would be able to cope with those requirements. We're not talking something outrageous after all. Any recent laptop would do, and the DSL or cable connection you already have.
@_date: 2019-04-04 15:14:05
That's nice for those who can afford it. But the reasoning for clamping the requirements down at an extremely low level was so that even poor people who can't afford up-to-date hardware can run full nodes. Trust me, those people will not run anything at a loss. 
They also won't have investments to protect. Those among us lucky enough to have investments worth protecting will be able to buy a modern day computer.

I'm not aware of such a wallet. Do you know one? But RBF makes it trivial. That's why I called it awkward. A workaround solution to a problem that shouldn't exist in the first place. Adding complexity to something that should be simple and straight-forward.

The problem is that in a normal market, supply and demand find a balance via price. Demand goes up, prices rise, more suppliers are attracted by higher prices, supply goes up. Basic econ 101.
But a perfectly inelastic (fix) supply leads to runaway prices, that theoretically can go to infinity. Also basic econ 101. 
No matter how much you pay, you have no guarantee to secure a spot on the blockchain because someone else could've paid (your fee)+1 for the last spot. Which you won't even find out until after you submitted your tx and then you can't change its price anymore (except with awkward workarounds like RBF) and it's stuck in mempool.  That's not a functioning market.
@_date: 2019-04-05 08:24:57


Well, that's an unreasonable assumption and that's why it's a bad analogy. Also, comparing takeout with lightning network would assume that takeout is cheaper. At least where I live, that's generally not the case. And I generally can't jump the line by offering to pay more. But really, one restaurant is not the dining out market. That makes the dynamics fundamentally different from one currency that does, in fact, represent its own market.
As for "tank security formula 1" - another contrived analogy that attempts to frame things in a certain way that I think doesn't apply to cryptocurrencies. But if I have to stick with the analogy, yes, I'm quite sure a well-designed cryptocurrency can give you that formula 1 tank. You could have your cake and eat it too. 
I know you disagree and that's fine. As I said in another reply to you, sometimes it's best to just agree to disagree without calling each other names as happens on here so often. :-)

It changes the fundamental rule for accepting and keeping transactions, the "first-seen" rule. That makes transactions less predictable and breaks functionality that relies on the predictability of unconfirmed transactions. It  makes it easy to double-spend. 
Besides, all I wrote above still applies. You can still have runaway prices. Your newly increased fee, still doesn't open up more supply; it still doesn't guarantee you a spot on the chain. All it takes is one equally determined bidder to race against you.
Bitcoin should never have required a solution like RBF in the first place.
@_date: 2019-04-04 16:42:02
Nobody mentioned anything about universal, Einstein. What matters is what the receiver's node sees. I don't care if some other node somewhere out there sees my transaction in a different order.
Sure double-spend is possible. But double-spending a first seen tx requires moderate network and computing resources, some decent know-how, some luck. RBF makes it significantly easier.

off-chain = off the Bitcoin blockchain = not Bitcoin
Actually, I'm not against L2 solutions per se. I think they're an interesting solution for many use cases. I just happen to think that a) they shouldn't replace true Bitcoin use itself and b) they would work even better with larger base blocks.
As for the restaurant, it's not that good an analogy because a) no restaurant can change prices on the fly. If a long line forms outside, I can't just quickly reprint my menus. And b) like you said yourself "money doesn't act like restaurants". I can always go to another restaurant and eat my fill, but if it's that one money that captures all, as you said, then I'm forced to use that too. I can't just pay with a different money as I can go to a different restaurant. I'm forced to participate in that awful queue, whether I like it or not.

That's very nice of you. I run Folding and Boinc too. That makes us two of the enthusiasts I mentioned in my linked post.
Unfortunately, if Bitcoin wants to gain worldwide mass adoption, it needs to reach billions. The vast, vast majority are not like you and me. They don't run Seti or Boinc. They are not geek enough, they live in developing countries, they live hand to mouth. And in fact, the reasoning to keep blocksizes tiny was to enable exactly these people to run full nodes. But they won't. People who can't easily afford a half-modern computer, won't run Boinc and they won't run nodes of any kind. Not when your choice is between paying for a meal for your family and paying for a Raspberry Pi + 24/7 connectivity. 
Especially not when you can't even participate on the actual blockchain that you're supposed to run this full node for, because onchain fees cost more than your meal.
If your reasoning is to rely on enthusiasts, well, people like you and me can certainly also afford to run full nodes that require more than a RaspPi and can process &gt;1MB blocks. There is no decentralization worth mentioning lost in the real world.

You don't "incentivize node operators with efficient technology". You incentivize them with money. Unfortunately, that's not an option in Bitcoin and so nobody so far has been able to answer the question I already asked many times: [Why would anyone run a full node, no matter what the block size?](

No. A bitcoin spent also has to be bought first. 
If there is a high level of commercial activity with Bitcoin, as originally intended, then buying by customers and selling by retailers will more or less even out. 
And if we get to that point, it would provide a large barrier against these huge price fluctuations we've seen from pure speculation markets. It's much harder to move the price up or down with the backdrop of billions of dollars of sustained commercial activity than it is with nothing but a bunch of fear and greed-driven speculators acting on herd mentality.
And besides that, the more businesses we get to accept cryptocurrencies and the more people actually use it to pay, the more businesses will be willing to retain at least some of their revenue in crypto and use it to pay some of their own expenses, thus closing the loop and providing even more price support.
All that will bring real utility to Bitcoin and utility has a value. That value will be reflected in the price. To people preaching "Store of value first!" I say Hogwash! What value? Based on what? And, btw, how has storing value based on noting but speculation been working out so far in 2018?

The price floor would come from a balance of large-scale buying and selling due to sustained commercial activity. Not necessarily with drugs, but anything that can be bought and sold. A high volume market like that would automatically find an equilibrium that's much harder to move up or down.
Hodlers remove liquidity. Unless they keep buying, they do nothing to stabilize the price. You just end up with a much smaller market, and smaller markets are much easier to manipulate than large and liquid ones. 
How has the hodling-to-create-value strategy been working out so far in 2018?

I didn't get into into Bitcoin for a digital gold story. I got in it for electronic cash - like nearly everyone else around that time. 
The drive up to 20k in late 2017? Yes, of course that's the get rich quick fools, many of whom bought into the digital gold story. THAT is also cherry-picking. I'm quite sure during 2013-2016 price was driven by what I described in my last post. If not actual wide-spread use yet, then at least the expectation of such as we all could witness the momentum build up. (overshadowed by a few major events like the MtGox collapse) That all ground to a halt when it became clear core would rather strangle Bitcoin's usability to death than keep the momentum and ride the adoption wave. Instead they started pushing the store of value / digital gold / layer-two stories.
But no, Bitcoin's strength is NOT to be a digital gold without any usability value to back it up. The foolishness of that position you are witnessing live these days. Gold itself is volatile enough, but show me in which decade it had [multiple 80%+ crashes]( That volatility in Bitcoin is not going to go away as long there is nothing else to stabilize it. Just speculating on it being "gold" will just lead right to the next speculation bubble and crash. Stability would come from widespread commercial use, sustained high-volume of buying and selling, where someone dumping 1000 coins barely makes a blip on the market. That's when you get the digital gold properties as cream on the top. Instead, today, among nothing but gold-only dreamers, you dump 1000 coins and watch the price tank. 
As for being able to "buy things satisfactorily with cash and cards" - you need to realize that a) USA ≠ the world and b) the definition of "satisfactorily" is highly subjective. 
There are billions of people who don't have access to credit cards and bank accounts and would still like to have a way to participate in e-commerce and other transactions at a distance. People who live with hyper-inflation and see their cash turn to toilet paper, just ask in Venzuela, Argentina, or several places in Africa like Zimbabwe. 
And even in the West, I, for example, don't appreciate having my [credit card transaction records sold to the highest bidder]( (and btw [Mastercard has been doing this for years]( or get [threatened and have my accounts frozen for buying the wrong coffee]( Bitcoin was supposed to remedy these things. Electronic cash - uncensorable, (semi-)anonymous, [global, fast, cheap]( That's where Bitcoin's strengths lie. Or better: used to. Before there was core and a digital-gold-only story.

Doesn't jibe. 
A large Bitcoin economy would be made possible by large-scale economic activity. By definition. Yes, that means buying, selling, paying for things. Bitcoin sitting dead in a wallet for years do not make an economy.
Unless hodlers keep buying endlessly, they do not drive up the value of BTC. They just remove liquidity and you end up with a much smaller market. Smaller markets are much easier to manipulate than large and liquid ones where the price is found as a balance of sustained high-volume commercial activity.

And if you'd prefer to cherry-pick other years, I'll gladly point out that throughout most of Bitcoin's history the price was in fact driven by actual or expected commercial activity. Beginning with the 10,000-BTC pizza, adoption, adoption, adoption was the mantra and every large new merchant was widely celebrated including right here in this sub. Dell, Expedia, Overstock, Microsoft, Valve/Steam, Braintree/Paypal etc., etc. Oh, isn't tomorrow Black Friday? I remember when Bitcoin Black Friday was a big deal and staggering BTC revenue numbers were all over the crypto news. Those big wins often triggered an upswing in price. 
Today? Many of those merchants stopped accepting Bitcoin, Bitcoin Black Friday is a mere shell of its former self and the price tanked throughout the whole year. Congrats to your store of value! Hope you didn't store too much though.

Thankfully, Satoshi's early coins have never moved.

A few things:
* The cc processing fee depends on your business type and volume. In the US, I pay 25ct + 2-3% (differs by card brand), not nearly 5%. In Europe, those [hidden fees are capped by law]( and substantially lower. Here is an example of [Mastercard fees in Germany]( max 0.3%
* Bitcoin you collect may have to be moved around internally, e.g. from POS system to cold storage, incurring extra fees each time.
* You would, however, benefit from accepting Bitcoin by eliminating any fraud and chargeback risk. This risk also differs by business type; it is very low in typical face-to-face small business retail, so eliminating it may not actually save you all that much either.
* While cash does have zero built-in fees, it's not free to process. You run the risk of getting robbed. You may have to pay for cash pick up by a security service or drive to the bank yourself every day. Some banks charge fees for large deposits in coins and small bills.
* Adoption is driven by consumers more than businesses. Consumers ask to pay by card because they get cash-back, miles, points. And because they can [spend money they don't have]( Businesses provide what consumers ask for. Of course, the consumer pays for the cash-back/miles/points "savings" several times over in higher prices, but most don't think that far. Also, you usually don't get a discount for paying cash, so may as well swipe the card - hence reinforcing the card as preferred payment method. A sinister circle exploiting human psychology, fully intentionally set up that way by the credit card industry. Bitcoin can't replicate that until we can wean ourselves off the silly cash-back habit.

Ah, the memories. Feels different now though.
Back then I felt "OK, it's an exchange collapse triggering the crash. Bad, but not the end of the world. Nothing has changed on the fundamentals. Bitcoin is still a superior form of currency. People will realize that eventually and we'll recover and take over the world! Just a bump in the road."
This time around: 
* Bitcoin has lost one of the most important characteristics of a currency - it's no longer an efficient medium of exchange for all kinds of transactions. Taking over the world as new currency seems farther away now than in 2013. 
* There are countless competitors out there jostling to take Bitcoin's crown, some of which have arguably better technology, just not the name recognition (yet?). 
* There is not the one clear culprit to point at for triggering the crash as there was back then. It seems more like an organic "coming to terms with reality" now.
I have no doubt there will be a recovery. I'm not sure it will still be led by Bitcoin, but I am sure it will be slow and much more moderate. No more meteoric rise of a couple $1000 over a few days. More like [the recovery from the dot.com crash of 2000, which took "only" 17 years](

The Lightning Network, usually proposed as a scaling solution with small blocksizes, has several drawbacks. For example, it can help increase transactions per person dramatically, but not so much the number of people, since everyone has to open and close a LN payment channel in the limited space of the main blockchain. LN itself also relies on nodes which can monitor and exercise control of the money flow and extract fees. Because LN works better with well-funded nodes, there are concerns that LNs will consolidate around relatively few large nodes, not unlike banks.
Different people value those risks, pros and cons differently. Some would prefer to transact directly on the chain at all times because they see that as the original premise of Bitcoin, even if that means the chain getting large and some low-end hardware unable to operate full blockchain nodes anymore. Settling everything on-chain would necessarily require larger blocks. 
Opinions also differ about what constitutes a spam transaction and what other ways could be used to mitigate them.

Meade* [a general under Lincoln's command in the Civil War] *this letter. And remember, at this period of his 
life Lincoln was extremely conservative and restrained 
in his phraseology. So this letter coming from Lincoln in 
1863 was tantamount to the severest rebuke.*
*What do you suppose Meade did when he read the 
*Meade never saw that letter. Lincoln never mailed it. 
It was found among his papers after his death.*
You did the right thing. What's the point destroying another person's career over this? Although general feedback to Schwab on how to improve their training could help.

That is not the kind of bitcoin I originally signed up for. 
Yes, I absolutely do want mass adoption, be able to pay my taxi fare and the fruit lady around the corner directly in bitcoin, without having to rely on 3rd-party services like the lightning network. I did not get excited about bitcoin as an inter-bank settlement network, but as a new way of trading all kinds of things, large and small, between everyone globally without anyone being able to meddle with my transactions.
I'm not a developer, not even one of the earliest users, but I'm not a newbie either. Disregard my opinion if you like, but be assured if you stunt Bitcoin into something much smaller than what it was originally meant for (from reading the whitepaper), I will happily sell off the couple coins I have, delete my wallet, and continue paying the fruit lady in old-fashioned cash.

OK, so if you already knew at the time you posted that chart, that Dell and Valve had stopped accepting Bitcoin in 2017 and that Edeka was only one independent franchisee, who had also already stopped, then it seems very disingenuous to still include these companies in your 2018 listing. They are not "Expected changes in 2018", they had already changed.
And I'd still like some more background on those other listings. As I said, an independent dealer doing his own payments thing does not qualify as "Company with more than $1 billion in revenue who accept Bitcoin". If it's not corporate policy, you can't credit the billion-dollar company. Edeka should never have been on your list in the first place. For the casual reader, looking at your ["the Bitcoin adoption is scyrocketing" headlines](  it paints a wrong picture and I'm pretty sure you know that.
For example, I remember the Braintree announcement a while ago. While that's already a stretch from there to just say "Paypal accepts Bitcoin", I just had a look at the Braintree site and [don't see Bitcoin]( as one of their "almost any way to pay" anymore, and [can't find any other mention of Bitcoin]( 
Look, we all want adoption to grow. It might be tempting to cling onto all kinds of inaccurate proxies to show what you want to see. But you don't need "36 stats" with questionable estimates where "no one knows the real figure" and misleading company listings (what does it even mean for adoption if they accept it and nobody uses it?). There is a much easier way to look at it - the blockchain. Just look at the value in fiat transacted every day over the Bitcoin network, simple as that:
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:29:24
If that "lower estimate" is so low that it's several times away from the real figure, it'd be a pretty meaningless "estimate". May as well say *"at least* 1 user" (me). Definitely correct. Also completely pointless.
I think that 2.9m number makes a lot more sense than 7% of all Americans. Way too high. I know anecdotal evidence isn't representative, but I live in very tech savvy circles and might barely break the 1 in 14 threshold among my friends and colleagues. But if I count in their kids and grandpas (because they are also Americans) - no way 1 in 14 use Bitcoin. And I don't even wanna know what that number would look like in rural Alabama.
As for the list of companies, I don't know many of them and don't have time to check. But a few things stand out:
* Dell  
* Edeka  
  Has never accepted Bitcoin as a corporation. There was at some point one franchisee of one store in Hamburg who accepted Bitcoin for his online web shop, but a) not in his physical store (Edeka is a super market chain) and b) stopped accepting Bitcoin even online when it became impractical last year. Today, you can not pay with Bitcoin anywhere in the Edeka organization.
* Alza  
  Is a Czech electronics e-commerce site. Made a [splash about accepting Bitcoin]( on their main sites alza.cz and alza.sk early in 2017. Eventually posted an update about high fees and this is what their checkouts look like today: [Alza.cz]( and [Alza.sk]( Do you see Bitcoin as a payment option?  
  Besides, [Alza's 2017 revenue was 820m Euros]( which at the end of 2017 was USD 982m. The exchange rate was highest at the end of the year, so at any time earlier during 2017, it would have been even less in USD. It fails your &gt; $1bn threshold.
Those are some I happen to know about, and I have a feeling they are not the only ones that shouldn't be on your list. T-Mobile, Daimler, Subway etc. - are there really the bn-$ corporate entities behind it or are these stories like with Edeka, where an independent dealer is doing his own thing with payments? When I last paid my T-Mobile bill, I wasn't offered to pay in Bitcoin...

I do not see Opeepl mentioned anywhere in your linked article. But let's have a look anyway. A few quotes:














Not only do they concede that results can not be scaled up to the total internet population, but even if they could: internet users ≠ general public. They did not measure the American population, they did not even measure American internet users, they measured those internet users who visited 1 of 80 specific websites (and may not even be American). Not surprisingly:


A difference of 3 to 6 percentage points makes a result of 7% meaningless.

It's not fraud, it's how open-source software without trademarks and copyrights works. Fork, and fork some more. Nobody stops you.
And if you fork Bitcoin so that you share the genesis block, how are you going to profit from your "fraud"? You would have only as many midipoet coins as you have bitcoins today and so does everybody else. You wouldn't have a stash of premine coins or any other founder reward that you could sell. At the same time, every Bitcoin whale would instantly also be a Midipoet whale and could sell their Midipoet coins just like you. They would thank you for the free money, but it would also crash the price and make it even harder for you to profit from your "fraud". Hard to see the "con" there. Even harder to see a legal case of any sort.

Coinbase provides multiple services - bitcoin marketplace, online wallet for everyday use, merchant payment services. 
The marketplace is for many people a convenient on-ramp to bitcoin, an easy place to buy and sell BTC through a linked bank account. And for that it is indeed a decent option, at least for US citizens who have few other choices and as long as you can deal with their ever-more stringent KYC/AML requirements, which involve rigorous ID verification, transaction limits, monitoring of your transactions, monitoring your payers'/payees' transactions, even account locks and closures (search this sub for [stories]( When you buy BTC, they at first end up in the Coinbase wallet. You should then move them all to your local wallet under your own control as soon as possible and keep a zero balance on Coinbase.
Many people don't. They are scared of being responsible for securing their own wallet. They think having an online service to access from any device is more convenient. They are too lazy to set up and learn to use a local wallet. So they keep all their funds on Coinbase in a regular 1-signature wallet and use that for storage or every-day use. 
But transaction instructions broadcast into the network need to be signed by the owner of the wallet. With the default addresses CB gives you, only one such signature is required and Coinbase keeps the key to it. If you use Coinbase, you give the power of signing transactions away to them. You're not really the owner of the bitcoin as far as the network is concerned. Coinbase is. That means you have to log in to ask Coinbase to please sign a transaction on your behalf. That could become a problem if, say, one day Coinbase disapproves of your [purchase of Cuban coffee]( and locks your account.
However, one good use for Coinbase is to keep one multi-signature key there. Set up a multi-signature wallet that requires 2 out of 3 signatures to broadcast valid transactions. You give one key (signature) away to Coinbase, keep one in your own local PC wallet or phone and the third on a paper backup in a safe box, Trezor etc.
To sign everyday transactions, you use your computer (1st key), go online, log into CB (2nd key). Now you have 2 of 3 and you're good to go. If Coinbase starts giving you shit, pull out your other key from your safe box, combine with the one on your computer. Now you can broadcast a valid transaction to the Bitcoin network via your PC wallet and - voilà! - you pull your Bitcoin balance out to a new address without even logging in to CB.
Similar if your computer gets stolen. The thief has only 1 key, not enough to sign transactions. You retrieve your paper backup, combine with CB and can move your BTC to a new wallet before the thief can do any damage.

Get your own wallet and start *using* it.
If you "only want it for investment reasons", as you wrote in another comment, you're missing the point. Lot's of people complain how Bitcoin has no "intrinsic value" and therefore will fail like any speculative bubble. That's true [gasp!] if you only do exactly that - speculate. Let it sit there and do nothing.
Bitcoin's value comes from being used. It has tremendous utilitarian value as payment system, especially cross-border, but even for simple transactions at home. That value is derived from transacting cheaper, faster and safer than any current alternative. The more Bitcoin is being used to exploit those advantages, the more value will be created and the more you will see the bitcoin price go up.
So, as an investor interested in seeing the price rise, do yourself a favor and start using it.

I should have said multi-signature address instead of wallet. 
Think of it this way: Every transaction on the Bitcoin network has a script attached that tells the network exactly how this transaction is to be executed. The most common way is a simple one payer, one recipient (1:1) transaction with a single signature. The script says something like "This address wants to send this much bitcoin to that address. Sender address requires 1 signature. Signature attached."
In case of a multi-sig address it will say: "This address wants to send this much bitcoin to that address. Sender address requires 2 signatures. Two signatures attached."
[Digression: This is one of the coolest features of Bitcoin as it enables the fabled smart contracts. Programmable money. Check out a project like [Lighthouse]( a crowdfunding platform without any center of operation other than the blockchain. Their scripts will say "This address wants to receive this much bitcoin. Accept partial payments from many paying addresses (many:1 transaction). Sender address 1 to pay this amount, address requires 1 signature, signature attached. Sender address 2 to pay this amount, address requires 1 signature, signature attached. Sender address 3 to pay this amount... Execute only if by date so-and-so the required total is reached." So if the crowdfunding target is not reached, nothing happens and donors will simply keep their bitcoin.]
Almost all wallets, when you use them in their default setup will generate single-signature addresses for you and store the one private key for that signature. That's where the risk comes in because whoever has that one key, has full control over all the funds stored on that address.
To set up a multi-sig address requires some extra steps and not all wallets have that feature built in yet. [Coinbase does.](
Just to be clear on the concept of wallet vs. address. A wallet is a piece of software that manages bitcoin addresses. Bitcoin addresses is what the blockchain cares about and where the value is stored. In simple cases, where you set up a wallet with one single-signature address, you *could* say you have x bitcoin in your wallet. But technically that's not correct. The bitcoin are on the address you keep in that wallet. You could export the private key to that address to another wallet and suddenly you have x bitcoin in two wallets. You didn't just double your money, it's just that the two wallets now manage the same address. Similarly, you can manage multiple addresses and their respective keys in one wallet. 
You can also manage a multi-signature address, but only keep one of several required keys in that wallet. To create a valid multi-sig transaction you need to attach the required number of signatures. How to do that when you keep the keys dispersed in different places depends on the wallet you use. As for how-to videos, I don't have a bookmark list handy, would have to search. I trust you can do that too. ;-)

The default wallet (Bitcoin QT) forces you to download the entire blockchain, currently [about 30GB]( Electrum doesn't. 
Electrum also is a [HD wallet]( where you can recover unlimited addresses incl. private keys from one 12-word "seed". This helps avoid reusing addresses, hence improving privacy.

In the multi-sig scenario, it could make sense to keep one key at CB (or a similar service) to disperse they keys. Say you have a 2-out-of-3 setup. You keep one key on your computer, one at Coinbase, one on a paper backup in a safe box. To sign everyday transactions, you use your computer, go online, combine your local and the CB key. Now you have 2 of 3 and you're good to go for any transaction. Say your computer gets stolen. The thief has only 1 key, not enough to sign transactions.

OP is - somewhat sarcastically - hinting at the fact that using Coinbase (or any similar 3rd-party service) is not using Bitcoin the way it was meant to be used, but rather more like using a bank (that just happens to take BTC deposits).

Or you could just make a normal app.

For having an "incompetent" CEO, Coinbase seems to be doing quite well as a business.
Besides, "incompetent" is your word, btw. OP just mentioned the name. And there's a big difference between "I don't like him" and "incompetent".

Damn, and I was so hoping to install it on my laptop computer!  When is EBWLC 2.0 coming out?

This is not a bank. You don't "withdraw". 
You move coins from one BTC address to another by instructing the Bitcoin network to do so. Sensible people do this by operating their own wallets locally and can thereby broadcast the transaction instructions to the network anytime they want from their own computer.
Transaction instructions broadcast into the network need to be signed by the owner of the wallet to prove ownership. In most cases, only one such signature is required. If you use Coinbase, you give the power of signing transactions away to them. You're not really the owner of the bitcoin as far as the network is concerned. Coinbase is. And in that case, yes, you have to log in to ask Coinbase to please sign a transaction on your behalf.
However, say you set up a multi-signature wallet that requires 2 out of 3 signatures to broadcast valid transactions. You give one key (signature) away to Coinbase and keep the other two in your own local wallet, a paper backup and/or Trezor etc. Then you can still create a valid transaction using your own computer just like in the first case above, broadcast it to the Bitcoin network and it will be accepted because it has the required 2 signatures attached. Entirely without Coinbase.

It's not.
DW is [Deutsche Welle]( the German public broadcaster for overseas Germans and people interested in Germany. Like Voice of America or the BBC World Service. They are tax-funded and don't produce ads.

How so? Are you even using their service?
0 fees until you hit your first million in revenue.  
Then 1%. Not 1-3%.  
Cash equivalent straight into your bank account.
And before you claim "cash equivalent" is a big risk because bitcoin is oh so volatile, exchange rate risk during the 15 min buying window is absorbed by Coinbase. If you want US$ 20 for your item, you will get US$ 20 (minus 1%) straight to your bank and it can never be clawed back by anyone.

Sorry the late reply, but I'm not on Reddit all the time. Just wanted to add to this point:


One question that nobody who puts decentralization above everything else has been able to answer me. To maintain decentralization, you need more people running full nodes. But why would limiting Bitcoin's throughput make more people run nodes? 
[See my thoughts here.]( Posted this a few times. Never got a response.

It's different people. "Whoever directed those mined coins" is not a person. It's the Bitcoin system paying out mining rewards to thousands of different miners.

Sure, but price or markup wasn't the question. The question was "Can you buy bread with gold?" And the answer is: Yes.

Also because banning using Bitcoin as payment for goods and services is like pulling the rug out from under its feet. The whole value proposition of Bitcoin and what long-term supporters (as opposed to speculators) base their investment on is the idea that Bitcoin will become a substitute for fiat currency to some degree. If you remove that, all you're left with really does resemble tulip bulbs.

Our democratic gov't ≠ Chinese gov't

What I don't understand is if the Chinese really do use BTC as a vehicle of capital flight, to evade currency controls as has often been stated, then what do these Chinese exchanges, or this CEO personally, do with all the Yuan coming in?
I'd imagine people transfer Yuan to the exchange, convert to BTC, move BTC overseas and exchange for EUR or USD. Few will go the other way. The Chinese exchange gets all the Yuan and cannot freely convert it to EUR/USD because of currency controls. Non-Chinese exchanges don't accept Yuan. So how do the Chinese exchanges get enough BTC for their operations? And what with the Yuan surplus?
