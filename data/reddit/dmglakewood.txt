I'll be "that" guy....what's it matter? Who cares if they know about me and serve be relevant advertisements? Who cares if the group my actions to help better their platform? Who cares if they use captchas to help users tech neural nets? 
If you're afraid of being tracked I'd probably delete you're reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc etc. Almost everything now a days is tracked. I wouldn't be surprised if sometime soon microwaves will be wifi connected and sending cook times to the web. It's a way of life and there's no way around it. Even using duck duck go doesn't stop the tracking on the sites you visit. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 03:21:34
Yep I'm seeing the same thing

Giving access to someone is way different then tracking someone. You can follow someone with your car it doesn't mean you give them your keys to drive their car. 
Being tracked is so widespread that it's a joke to even try to prevent it from happening. If you think Google doesn't know you visited some website because you used duck duck go then you don't realize much of the web Google owns. Unless you go to crazy extremes to stay hidden...someone has a profile on you somewhere. 
What I'm simply saying is why fear it? There are so many actual bad things in this world to fear that someone storing my search history doesn't make me lose any sleep. I'm not saying it should be allowed or what I want them to do it....I'm simply saying it's not that big of a deal in my opinion.

@_date: 2018-01-14 05:18:56
You do realize though that almost every website online has at least 1 callback to Google? Whether you use duck duck go or Google...more than likely Google still knows what you're up to. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:45:35
It's misleading because bitcoin can only be circulated online where typical currency circulation means physical money. So sending money online isn't in circulation is how I understand it.

As investor I more so mean a user of bitcoin. I use bitcoin to purchase items from time to time and I hate the large fees.
@_date: 2018-01-22 04:43:08
That's exactly what I spend large purchases on. It's just easier to send crypto vs having to deal with the banks.
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:38:07
It's not hard to acquire that many coins as long as you contact the bank a few days ahead of time they can pretty much get you as many coins as you want.
@_date: 2018-01-14 02:06:53
This is true with just about ever new company in any industry.
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:44:59
Honestly, I hope this happens more. Eventually people will learn to hodl and not freak out over every little thing.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:41:48
Do you mine coins the govt sees that pretty much like you're working a job. Any money you make is taxed the same way as if you had a job. Depending on what tax bracket you're in this can be as high as 39%. Now here's where it gets a little tricky...since bitcoin is seen as an investment  you're taxed again whenever you convert bitcoin (or whatever coin you're mining) to USD.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:41:29
I tried sending mine to Bittrex hours ago and Bittrex doesn't even show a pending incoming transaction.

I don't think it's a bubble, but with that said while in a bubble people have all kinds of excuses as to why it's not a bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:36:22
Yeah and bitcoin price has really taken a hit because of it
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:54:25
Yeah if you're only in it for profits you might have a bad time. People need to realize that bitcoin is like trading 3x ETFs times 2. You can make a lot of money real fast or you can go into the red real fast. I feel bad for anyone that has money they can't afford to lose in cryptos.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:35:54
You never know how big of a dip is coming or when it's over. Typically any time you can lower your average cost is a great thing. That 16k dip could have went from 16k to 25k in a few days.

@_date: 2017-12-23 18:15:29
You get taxes when you receive it and when you convert it to anything else. If you keep it as bitcoin then no you wouldn't get taxed again. Although I read somewhere that the new tax plan says that if you spend crypto you have to figure out what gains or losses you currently have for the purchase you make and file those. I can't confirm that though just something I read online. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:22:13

Assuming he's in the US...you don't. Until it goes through the legal system which can take 6+ months you can't evict anyone. This goes for banks and landlords alike.

I own a raffle and I also mine cryptos so I know quite a bit about both. While it can be done teams would be able to pickup on this easily and disable your free supercharging. There's quite a few other issues as well, you'd be much better off building the rigs in your basement vs in your car.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:48:00
Cool story bro
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:24:45
That's fair. I really hope people aren't scared of a dip. If that's the case they should invest in some savings bonds.

@_date: 2017-12-10 19:03:14
One is using someone smart to find legal gaps in the system and the other is just disregard for the law. 
I'm sure there's legal gaps in the tax code when it comes to cryptos and by all means feel free to exploit them...but not paying taxes at all is just asking for trouble.
It's usually way easier to pay taxes when you owe them vs 3 years down the road.

Yeah because trying to screw over the county is a great way to get them to support cryptos. 
We should be working with the govt and doing what we need to be doing, not avoiding them. They can easily crush almost every crypto if they wanted to.

Bitcoin will always have the name and the fact that they were first. It may not seem like a big deal for educated investors, but to everyone outside the space that only knows of bitcoin it's huge.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:33:29
I'm not saying we're in a bubble, I'm simply saying in every other bubble people had good reasons as to why it's not a bubble. Only time will tell if we're in a bubble or not and of our reasoning seems as foolish as other bubbles in the past.
I personally don't really care about the money I more so care about the technology and changing how the world handles currency. So even if this is bubble and it pops I'll be just fine with it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:33:56
They're also trying to hire a ton of new people, but anyone that's grown a company before knows that has its own issues.

@_date: 2017-12-20 05:58:18
For sure...but when you don't understand anything about cryptos other than everyone is making a lot of money then you make uneducated decisions. A perfect example of this is I've had a bunch of people tell me how much they believe lightcoin is going to pop off simply because the price was 80$ or 150$ compared to 18,000. I ask them why they like it and all of them have told me the price has to go up look how cheap it is. 
While I understand how crazy that sounds....how many other users are thinking the same thing? Is the massive jump in lightcoin just from the rush of new coinbase users thinking the same thing? If so the idea that I can get this other bitcoin for 1/5 the price isn't too far fetched. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:22:00
Pretty much the whole market relies on bitcoin. If bitcoin drops almost everything else does as well.
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:06:36
I don't speak for everyone, but I personally mine to help cryptos not hurt it. All my rigs return their investment in 3 months anyways so I'm not worried about making a quick buck because is already such a quick ROI.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:47:45
I agree...I don't see a bear market coming yet though.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:40:54
For sure pay down debt. Investing should only be done when you only have low interest loans only. 
I get the draw of the large gains, but keep in mind they're not guaranteed where paying off debt is.

Bitcoin wasn't created as a replacement to banks but because there was a need for a non refundable currency. If you perform a job or service and get paid for it Satoshi thought that there shouldn't be a way to reverse the transaction. That's the main basis of bitcoin as outlined in the 8 page PDF that was released with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:48:22

@_date: 2017-12-22 05:50:46
Cryptos (a lot like stocks) are made up of optimist and pessimist and it's a constant battle between the two. At any point you can switch from being optimistic to pessimistic and vice versa. When everything goes up really high too quickly you get more and more people switching from optimist to pessimist.
Without a a correction (dip) you get more and more people all fearing the dip so when it starts it becomes a massive sell off. If you get little dips here and there though you all but prevent the massive sell off from people fear selling.
It's more a complex than that but it's the general idea.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:13:44
It's not anywhere on their roadmaps so I'm going to guys they'll release ripple next week!
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:24:21
They supposedly are going to pay everyone back. I mine with them just because payouts are higher. I don't care about an occasional hack it's worth the extra price in the meantime.

Been there before, but not with bitcoin. Luckily the IRS is very understanding and will work with you. The people that end up in jail really tried hard to end up there.
Backstory: I was 19 and created a business on accident. I had more money than I knew what to do with so I'd cross the border into Canada where it's legal to gamble and drink at 19. Long story short, me and my now wife had a very memorable time :D. Being so young and not being taught in school I assumed that I was going to get a massive refund check. In return Uncle Sam came knocking for 100k and I had none left.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:34:16
You're much better off buying some GPUs and mining directly. Much better ROI.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:22:26
You'd have a gain of 3$ and it would depends on your tax bracket but 20% would be the most you'd owe. So on your 3$ gain you'd owe 60 cents assuming you're in the top tax bracket. If you're in the lowest tax bracket there's no tax on capital gains for most investments. Then again no one in that tax bracket probably has and capital gains.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:05:53
All the aunts and uncles will mention something about bitcoin and then the the nerd of the family will try to explain the blockchain and how it's not a ponzi scheme etc etc. Then the aunts and uncles will buy in using coinbase for just a trial run. They'll realize they're up 15% and decided to buy in more and more. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:10:06
Tummy ache

Lol read up...I've read everything from the 8 page document released when bitcoin first came around to the accrual source code that runs it. 
Coinbase did lose a lawsuit (well kind of won, kind of lost). It's only for users who cased out 20k or more which is 2% of their users. The other 98% are safe....currently.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:36:13
You have no proof on that all you're doing is spreading fear. If you don't believe it will go back up then cash out and enjoy (hopefully you're up that'd be a bummer if not). There's no reason to create fear that we don't even know is real. I've seen pretty strong resistance at 13k which would still put Bitcoin up 60% or so in the past 30 days. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:46:02
That's damn good for a first print. My first print was stopped half way because the filament was all jammed up around the extruder. In my defense that was 7 years ago.

I just don't see how screwing over the govt. can ever go well for the future of cryptos.

@_date: 2017-12-10 14:25:39
I get that, but as long as you live in a country with laws you have to abide by them. A lot of people are going to be hating life when uncle Sam eventually gets all the data from these exchanges and realize they haven't paid any taxes on their realized gains.

That's the issue law makers are having right now. I don't believe you'd owe money currently but they want to change that. The whole space is confusing to law makers and they don't really know what to do about it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:36:37
No one really knows for sure but based on my research it seems like a correction was bound to happen sooner or later after the run up. The drama between coinbase, b cash etc etc started the correction and then the new investors started to fear sell. The complaints people are having with bitcoin aren't new they're the same complaints people have had for a while. So to me I dismiss that as the end of bitcoin...not to mention that the lightning network will fix almost all those issues. There seems to be a decent amount of support around 12-13k the bulls don't seem to want it to drop too much lower than that. 
I personally think that we might go as low as  11k before bouncing right back to 12-13k. We might sit at that area for a little bit but once all this news blows over and the drama settles down we'll start to climb again. Please please please don't buy more based on my thought process do your own research and draw your own conclusions. I will tell you this though this isn't the first or even the worst dip bitcoin has ever had and it's always bounced back. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:13:57

@_date: 2017-12-22 17:56:32
They're still getting slammed but not nearly as hard as they used to. Then again there's a lot more money in the crypto world so that makes things a little more "stable". 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:31:57
For me it pays higher for everything. I have about 40 GPUs 2 s9 and a l3+ and it pays higher for everything.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:27:23
True but if your were paid out in USD it would just be yours...then again you wouldn't be making any gains on it. It's just a different way of thinking seeing as most people aren't paid out in stocks that they can make gains on but also spend like money.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:49:28
Well, he technically wasn't wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:25:28
To be fair though, we still need banks. The collapse of 2007-2008 would have still happened even if bitcoin was king. Bitcoin is great at what it does, but bitcoin isn't loaning you money to buy a house or car. Without loans a lot of the consumerism dies, the housing market dies etc etc. Loans keep this country running and until we find a way to efficiently do peer to peer loans with minimal risk, we'll need the banks.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:31:40
10% is a joke man. Even in a bull stock market you can lose 10% in 10 minutes. If you panic sell after being down 10% you shouldn't be investing.

Right, that makes it even trickier. Some of the things like GPUs are depreciating assets while electricity costs are not. Not to mention you have to be able to specifically tell what portion of your energy bill is for mining. It's a pretty big headache but then again that's any business you run.

Don't put all your money into any single crypto or even the crypto market at all. Diversify across coins and even investments. Stocks are slow money compared to cryptos but even 7% gain is more than -7% gain. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:03:05
Honestly if anything small ever hits coinbase you better believe we're going to see some gains the likes of which have probably never been seen before, even in the crypto market.
I can't tell you how many people have told me they would love to buy bitcoin but they can't afford it. A lot of people think that you have to buy a full coin. So all these people that want to get in but can't now sees a crypto for 75 cents and the flood gates will open up.

You've never had to deal with millions of users at a time. It's hard, damn hard. I get it they're making so much money they should be better etc etc. They're not only having to figure out how to deal with the insane amount of new traffic but they are also exploding employee wise. Anyone that's ever owned a business will understand the whole getting too big too quickly problem. They haven't had enough time to even workout all the kinks in their company and yet they have to now hire hundreds of people and pretty much have them learn on the job as they scramble to try and keep everyone happy.

Right...the 9500$ price is a joke. It's going to fall hard to 3000-3500. Also a ton of coins are going to become available once everyone sells them off and the price may drop below 2500$ even. Give it a few months though and the money will start to flow back in as noobs will see it as a way to get in on bitcoin for cheaper. I can't tell you how many people I know tell me how much they believe in litecoin simply because of the price compared to btc and eth.

@_date: 2017-12-22 17:49:32
There are flaws with bitcoin don't get me wrong. However (and it's a big however) if they ever launch the bitcoin lightning network almost all the issues go away. So if the correction and resistance is based on network issues and all of a sudden they get resolved then it should take off. 
I personally don't think that's what is causing the sell off or the 19k ceiling I think that's more so a bunch of new investors who are very skittish about the whole crypto world but have a fear of missing out so they bought in. Then some drama goes down that starts the selling and people sell off.
Think about it for a second the problems bitcoin has isn't something that started yesterday. We had the same problems last week when bitcoin was climbing, so why all of a sudden would it be such a big issue?

True, and while that's unfortunate and I feel bad for them....corrections are perfectly normal. If you buy in at ATH you can't be too upset with a correction. Going up so fast so quickly creates bears or at least partial bears. People either cash out to lock in gains or they wait and see what the market does and right when it starts to turn they sell to lock in gains. This starts the correction and then as it starts to fall more and more people then start to fear sell. Then the opposite of what started it happens and as it falls you start to create more bulls or at least people that will watch the market and buy back in when it starts to go back up. This creates a great buying opportunity. You can't have massive gains without corrections.
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:11:57

@_date: 2017-12-22 18:18:21
Yes indeed. You need corrections to convert bears to bulls. People that have been wanting to buy in but were afraid to buy at ATH can now buy in. People who sold at 19k, 18k, 17k etc etc can now buy back in. 
You need corrections in any market that sees quick gains.

Technically anytime you sell anything no matter what you sell it for it needs to be filed. So if you sell btc and just have money chilling in your coinbase account, it's still technically a capital gain and needs to be reported to the IRS, it's not only when you send that money to your bank account.

The market is returning 15% +- 5% lately. You foresee (in the near future) bitcoin being anywhere close to that?
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:18:45
Umm you only pay taxes on gains not if you break even. You're supposed to technically file every buy and sell so they can keep an eye on things, but if you break even and sell you don't owe anything. Also the 40% (I'm assuming you're rounding up) is only for the top tax bracket. If you make 25k a year and realize 5k on gains you're going to owe far less than 40% on those gains.
Not to mention that capital gains are taxed at a much lower rate than your income. I believe the highest tax rate for capital gains is 20%.

While I get that he sucks, it's the way of life. Taking gains without paying taxes is illegal and we can't be too upset that were being forced to comply.
