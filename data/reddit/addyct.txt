Sorry, but you're just wrong. As I said, anyone who has watched ESPN during December knows that every single commercial break on every single ESPN Network (all 7 of them, at this time) contains at least one commercial advertising their upcoming bowls. The St. Pete's Bowl is one of the first bowls of the season, and gets a good week of advertising of this sort before the game.


And ESPN has a daily CFB show as well, which I guarantee you gets at least 5-10 times the viewership of any NASCAR show on FS1. They will discuss the game and most likely the sponsorship as well.
The simple fact that this will all take place on ESPN instead of FS1 makes it a much bigger deal. One mention on Sportscenter is worth a week of updates on whatever NASCAR specific show fox runs.

As far as TV viewership is concerned, immensely.

Have you ever had your comments posted in Because you sound like you have.

What sort of viewership numbers does FS1 actually get during their non-live sports broadcasts? I've not seen any numbers but I can't imagine it's very much at all.

You're right, looks like the 2013 St Pete Bowl only [did a 0.9]( not that great.
I would still contend that it's a much bigger deal than the Dogecar sponsorship, simply because of the exposure. Wise ran well, but he wasn't a huge part of the race and apart from a 30 second stretch where they described how the car came to be sponsored, the name "Dogecoin" wasn't really mentioned. This sponsorship comes with the name of the event, which will be mentioned in every commercial ESPN runs for it and any time they show highlights (which, if you've ever watched ESPN during December, you'll know is a *lot*), as well as six 30 second commercial spots during the game that you get to actually explain what Bitcoin is.

also, If you would finish reading the thread, you'll notice I already responded to this.

Since I haven't actually seen this stated anywhere in the thread, the answer is no money.
A few years back the reddit admins let all the moderators have the option to design and submit an ad for their subreddit that they would run when they didn't have any other ads to display ( in place of the "thanks for not using adblock!" Messages you sometimes see). This was one of the ads they started running then.
