Flawed comparison.  
Sonny's company did not pay out any winning, they were not a gambling company - just a giant scam.

commerce is not spam, its just a few pathetic bitchy devs (ie luke-jr) dont like how other people play with their toy.

26 Million problems to be exact.

BFL is operated by a convicted con man, Inaba (Josh) is one of the forum biggest man-child.
In short, there is no one on bitcointalk.org with less credibility.

you are a greedy idiot that deserves to lose their money.

but puppies and rainbows and unicorn erections !!!

According to the court documents **no actual gambling took place**.  
He took receivership of the money and paid out of a fraction of the money received or none at all for all players.

the moment that happens to any significant degree I will cash out 90% of my holdings and let the big boys play.

**This is a pretty damn good fluff piece.**


**No, this is not why BFL's name is being dragged through the mud**, anyone that is not a paid shill knows the on going history of lies, under performance, 2nd hand parts and absolutely shitty customer service.
Their company fucking stank long before we found out that Sonny is a Convicted con man.

yikes, no wonder people think bitcoin is some kind of scam.
You approach it the same way those amway freaks do.
@_date: 2012-09-11 15:28:30
and yet not a single big name vendor.
@_date: 2012-10-08 09:47:56
what was the september announcement ?
@_date: 2012-11-20 01:27:51
so whats stops someone labeling another persons address ?
@_date: 2012-10-18 07:37:53
Solution, fuck the hoarders.
Use colored coins to identify hoarded coins and devalue them (refuse them).
@_date: 2012-09-20 14:00:31
good work, be prepared for a barrage of shills attacking you though.  
They have plenty on reddit as well.

Sounds like they are going to premine the fuck out of all their client funded ASIC's right up until the halving then sell.
A company with the reputation of BFL having that much influence and possibly owning that much BTC ?   
Its for these reasons I am not interested in BTC anymore, I have already moved most of my digital assets to litecoin before the price jumped from 4c to 8c :D.
I shall watch this one from the sidelines.
@_date: 2012-08-09 05:13:09
Fuck Dwolla.
@_date: 2012-09-18 04:02:07
Not by the time BFL deliver it to you +6 months after order when the difficulty is so high that even asic miners have to shutdown unless they have free power.

This is a blog post, its not a paid Forbes journalist covering bitcoin for Forbes.  
Attaching "- Forbes" is a bit misleading to say the least.
@_date: 2012-10-11 11:16:37
is there a explanation behind this ?
@_date: 2012-11-27 06:44:07
I do wonder what his agenda is, perhaps he is just a neckbeard that thrives on any attention ?
@_date: 2012-10-11 11:32:57
couldnt you do the following:  
coins become discoloured if not sent directly from issuer to 1 voting address.
ie more than 1 hop from voter registration to voting == null 
@_date: 2012-09-20 04:25:25


absolute bull shit expertly delivered by Inaba.

Ahh something awful forums, where the bitter irrelevant losers of the net go to circlejerk each other to sleep every night.
