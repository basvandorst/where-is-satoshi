We need to organize and pass a law legalizing digital currencies like bitcoin as "quasi-legal tender", so as to be used like a dollar would, but not to step on too many toes of entrenched government currency interests.

I think a better analogy would be the airplane industry somehow harming the car industry.

All I have seen is each side bickering about how evil the Classic or Core team are and how they want to destroy Bitcoin. For example What I really want to know is what is so fucking difficult about making Bitcoin a limitless transaction network and currency? What it stopping it? I don't really know what 1 MB signifies exactly but all I can tell is that it's a contentious point because it's limiting the amount of transactions and some people want it raised sooner and others later. But what really got me curious was the fee proposal where small transactions would be priced out of the system. I just wondered, 'what's the big problem that's stopping it from scaling so it handles everything? How exactly is it problematic?'

Technical competence isn't the only component of leadership otherwise it would've been Steve Wozniak (who is far more well-adjusted) and not Steve Jobs.

By that description he seems to be saying that the team is made up of people who spend all their time on sites like these instead of in the real world:

Yes there is. Be real, in effect it's the developers in Core.
