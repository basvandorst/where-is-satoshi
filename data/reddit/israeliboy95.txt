believe my i know
edit: may i ask what bank
@_date: 2017-08-07 01:19:37
They offer ACH transfer and very simple verification which is convenient for people who have banks who can't make wires. Conbase and Gemini both require extensive KYC and their support is horrible. What other exchanges offer ach transfer that im missing. And cex isn't available in all states so that's out the picture 
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:42:27
correct they provide a service for Europeans if im not mistaken
