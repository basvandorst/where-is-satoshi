The post I also posted on the /purse_io reddit
So, I've also had this problem. I had a debt on my account which was for about 150$. After a while the negative balance on the account was gone and I did another order. When I tried to withdraw it disabled my account, support saying yea it's for the debt, still giving me no reason for them to disable it. After that I was like, "why not make another account". Well after trying to withdraw 120$ on the new account they also closed that. So now they took almost double the amount of the debt I was owing them apparently and the support doesn't reply to any of my emails anymore. I'm really close to taking legal action as this is scamming and fraud. (The fact alone they ban accounts when trying to WITHDRAW is hilarious, because they want to scam you even more.) Also, a friend just tried to withdraw BTC from his purse account to my BTC Address and it disabled his account. I mean how scummy can one company be. Funny enough their support can't even speak proper English so it was a pain in the ass dealing with them before ignoring me in the first place. I'll see if I can contact their CEO and ask him about the incidents, if that doesn't help I'll make it more public via some kind of Bitcoin News.
Can also add e-mail proof etc. if needed :)
Edit: And no, I don't use fraudelently acquited Gift Cards. I bought them on egifter or gyft

Imagine you're not from Cali. 
Really fun getting in contact with the authorities. And then again, for me, it's really not worth it for 300$...

I also have this problem and I can confirm that purse.io stops answering once problems come up.
