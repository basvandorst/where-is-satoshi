Well he landed on the side of the escalator that will get him straight up to the top again.

Sorry but this is not correct. Do not trust, verify!

Ssssshhhhh! Just imagine 0,3% of the world population trying to purchase a whole bitcoin. D:

Thank you for letting us know. Others have already done the speculation for you though. :-/

I think would be neat to have a link to this resource in the sidebar.
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:30:54
So did he prove that he is truly Satoshi or did he not? ;-)
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:51:46
I think it would be great to have some resources sticky or in the sidebar of with detailed information on how to run a full node.
The issue for me is that my bandwith is pretty much limited and I am experiencing drawbacks in my internet usage when running a node. I should really do some research on how to run a a full node remotely once I actually got some sleep.

No please just keep spreading shit like "It's got no serious foundation", "Bitcoin is backed by... media attention" or "It's literally a hot air balloon running on hype". It will be more fun to laugh at you in the end.

Lopp said that he is "not so easily intimidated". To me this suggests that Lopp himself thinks that the Swatting is related to his position on S2X.
Maybe Lopp can provide further information.
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:55:05
Yea, must agree. Strange: First you pretend to be the mastermind of deduction and then you say "Unlikely it was b2x related".
Sorry, smells somehow fishy.

I just discovered that I am officially recognized as troll by the troll army... Ha! Kind of an achievement.
@_date: 2017-10-30 20:03:54
Awesome! This could lead to a bullish market reaction...
...once the market understands what it actually means.
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:27:24
Well I'd just guess there is no way to convince someone of the enormous potential of the bitcoin blockchain who presents "It's got no serious foundation", "Bitcoin is backed by... media attention" or "It's literally a hot air balloon running on hype" as facts.
The wait-and-see approach seems most appropriate for you.
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:15:38
Luke, I agree with you.
It is vital that we keep Bitcoin a decentralized (and thus resilient) network.
However, I think such proposal would be an easy target for the troll army and would hardly find consensus for the reason that only few (seem to) understand what this is really about.
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:17:01
FYI: Pretty much everyone.
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:23:56
Wow, this is terrible. And shows that there are truly evil actors among the SegWit2x-movement. Everyone please be careful!
@_date: 2017-05-06 22:10:28
Bandwith Unlimited (BU)... ó_Ò  Can you provide evidence? How many nodes less do you think is acceptable in order to increase the blocksize?
@_date: 2017-05-06 22:46:40


I think you are completely wrong. How many of the bitcoin users do you think run a node? It is probably less than 2%.
No! We can have far more nodes if it were more convenient and less costly to run a node. Not by increasing the cost of node operation.
@_date: 2017-05-06 20:40:16
Is this just a troll vote?
It seems like the Bot-Army is not (yet) prepared to fake the vote! We have 80%+ Pro-SegWit!!
@_date: 2017-05-06 21:17:58
Too much to support it with absolute confidence. Thing is that we cannot test its impact on network topology in a production-like environment.
@_date: 2017-05-07 09:13:33


@_date: 2017-05-06 21:37:32
Do not get my wrong, I want the network/code to improve but even if we freeze the code right now, the "store of value" as well as the "investment" applications of bitcoin will still enable a massive growth. I think we are just at the very beginning.
However to allow for applications like "payment" and "smart contracts" in bitcoin I think the 2nd layer applications are inevitable.
@_date: 2017-05-06 23:15:24
But I thought Bitcoin is a permissionless and decentralized network? If you want to exclude certain people maybe is the better place for you?
@_date: 2017-05-06 22:33:25
Ok, if you think so you should really support SegWit so that we can have all of these use cases to secure the current growth.
@_date: 2017-05-06 22:57:21
Okay, that makes sense. The data cap is not a bottleneck.
@_date: 2017-05-01 18:31:54
Your post history shows activity in subreddits related to darknet and drugs. Not that I want to accuse you of something but would it be possible that you got the attention of the police in this way? Or did you happen to facilitate trades for your boyfriend on bitcoin.de?
@_date: 2017-05-06 21:57:01
I agree! However I would guess that it is easier for the user to increase the size of the RAM than to increase the bandwith. At least for me this is the case.
@_date: 2017-05-06 20:56:40
I voted "No".
Even SegWit seems too much given the current level of decentralization of the network. It is in fact already a compromise.
@_date: 2017-05-06 20:27:24
Yes, yes, yes! ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ give 2,000 US-$ / BTC!!!
@_date: 2017-05-06 22:41:06
Uhm, please lets stick to facts. I am sure noone in the world has unlimited bandwith. I live in the middle of Germany and my bandwith is limited to ~7 MBit/s. Shall only the people from the bigger cities be able to run a node? 
@_date: 2017-05-06 21:02:56
It's not about the hard drive, more about bandwith.
And in this context 2MB-4MB SegWit is better than a completely variable blocksize (BTU), also it fixes malleability, allowing for so many new applications (and thus users).
A simple increase to 2MB would get us to the same point where we are right now in a few months and the (well-tested and accepted among industry) SegWit SF will allow for scaling bitcoin almost indefinitely on the second layer. Think about it.
2nd layer is required. We need it. Better sooner than later. Price WILL appreciate!!!

Please take a look at  ... this is nowhere near the bitcoin production environment.

How many bitcoin businesses are out there?
Even if we double the amount of bitcoin businesses (so many use BitGo and similar services already) that would probably not even make up for a loss of 5% of user nodes.
