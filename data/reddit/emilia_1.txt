It wont drop that much, it has already been going down for the last days but it seems that now it really wants to keep going up, so yes, if you are going to invest soon, do it right now that the price is almost going to go up soon.
I don't think there's a fall hit bitcoin considering the supply getting low now and bitcoin getting popular.
That's the fundamental , also a little bit doubt that the price could go up soon as nothing i can hear about the good news that can support it.
I just pretty confident bitcoin will grow slowly in the next 2 years so yeaaa put your money as long term investment now.
to date, there have been so many predictions about the price for the next year that I do not understand Will Bitcoin raise its price or not. Although we already saw the maximum value of 20,000 dollars, and I believe that Bitcoin will return to this indicator. But the forecasts were much larger already in the next 2018.

These days, you really can't go anywhere without hearing about Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency. Bitcoin took off in a huge way in 2017, and it doesn't look like it's going to be slowing down anytime soon - the value just keeps climbing. So, it really isn't surprising that in 2018, everyone is going to want a piece of the action. If you're thinking about diving into Bitcoin or Ethereum mining, it would be wise to go for one of the best mining firm ever.
