I'm watching to see this $16k sell wall come down.
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:57:48
Facebook crypto announcement, maybe?

A bit late to be cashing out for Christmas, no?
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:40:22
Unless people who have overspent for Christmas now realise they can't pay their bills at the end of the month ��

I think I read that having coins in Coinbase would be fine for the fork to get the new coins.

Except it's now coming around the 28th of this month.

Bought the dip. Up we go again.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:38:47
Hadr fokr?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:18:01
Gobbled that up like Pacman
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:07:14
Looks like the bottom of the dip was around 7:30am here (UK). The price has been rising steady-ish since then.

HODL for the hard fork.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:37:44
I don't understand why people are not keeping their Bitcoins until the hard fork coming up?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:44:34
HODL yer coins too.

No singing here. Still watching the charts ��

Upvoted purely for 'bellend'.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:53:16
Back up over $10k.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:45:40
People getting jittery and selling up while they can?
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:05:08
Heading for $10k again before the day's done.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:18:03
Don't shoot the messenger.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:44:53
Seems okay here.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:26:22
Been down over an hour here.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:29:42
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:55:05
Still waiting on China etc to wake up so who knows? ��

And exercise, but only for Type 2.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:09:56
Especially after The Big Bang Theory episode tonight...
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:20:54
Not for me ��
