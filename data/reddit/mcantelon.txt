Interesting... thanks for the explanation!

What does whether it's legally hers got to do with it? It's morally hers. You gambled someone else's money and lost. Noone can predict what Bitcoin's going to do in the short term, even more so than conventional markets.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:23:45
True, there's always folks who don't get it and you learn to tune out the ones without new arguments. As long as there's technology, there'll be techno-utopians and sky-is-falling extremes in opinion. The truth is somewhere in the middle.

I love how the Bitcoin alarmists come out when there's a crash then are remarkably silent when there's a boom.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:55:15
Yeah, this has played out a few times. After every crash people always write columns about how "Bitcoin is dead"... until the next rally. The fundamental fact is a lot of very smart people have their weight behind Bitcoin. It's not going anywhere.
@_date: 2013-04-25 19:51:14
Nice. It definitely seems straining to jump up.
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:53:15


That's a ridiculously good increase, although it sounds like you might have sweated for it. Be good to yourself!
Day trading isn't easy, especially with something like Bitcoin which is unpredictable and trades 24/7.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:43:43
It will be volatile until Bitcoin's place in society gets sorted out politically.

Reduced transaction fees, speed, irreversibility, and freedom (the ability to donate to Wikileaks, for example). By irreversibility I mean the ability to avoid scenarios like selling something via Paypal/Visa and having the customer rip  you off by reversing the charges. We're seeing the issue of irreversibility right now in the Dogecoin market: people want to buy in with Paypal, but few trust Paypal so they'll only accept other cryptocurrency for payment. Irreversibility is, of course, not always desirable and can be worked around through the use of third-party services (escrow, etc.).
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:30:10
So true. :&lt;
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:07:03
Really cool! Kickstarter that shit.

What's coming early next week?
@_date: 2013-04-18 18:38:09
Interesting... So, if I've got this right, a user pays ripple for XRP, then they can exchange money. The XRP is just used to pay the exchange fee. So ripple makes money by selling the XRP (like game companies sell in-game currency). So when exchanging currency I then have to work out a way to get the currency from the person I'm buying it from?
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:51:38
What is "true" is that Bitcoin remains a cryptocurrency that allows anyone to transfer value, globally and without interferece by the state, and is backed by the world's largest, most powerful distributed computing networks. Issues with Bitcoin's pricing aren't because of the technology not being "true", but because of the political environment in which Bitcoin exists evolving.
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:11:05
Sometimes that works. But the problem is at this point noone can predict where the price is going to be tomorrow. Sometimes it looks like it's crumbling, but it's actually only stumbling. So you sell your coins then the price skyrockets up. And up. And up. And if you want to buy back in you end up with a fraction of the coins you originally had.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:00:23
How so? Although the political environment's predictably hostile to Bitcoin, Bitcoin's fundamentals remain.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:41:49
If you've kept up with Bitcoin you'll know that after every "crash" there's been a period after which it's then shot up much higher than previous highs.

It's pretty common for Android apps to ask for a grab bag of permissions, though, so OP might have agreed to them out of habit.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:47:02
Apples to oranges comparisons are silly. Look at BTC's history: lots of boom/bust periods. And Enron, IIRC, was a derivative rather than a commodity unto itself. It didn't add value to the world whereas cryptocurrencies allow things that are otherwise impossible/difficult.
@_date: 2013-11-11 04:33:41
This would be a good thing to reenact in a Bitcoin commercial.
@_date: 2013-04-16 08:07:21
This is a good sign. The buzz is such that they can't ignore it anymore.
"First they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you, then you win."

Haha my gf started freaking out from the bathroom when I first got it working (playing a really high pitch).
@_date: 2013-04-16 19:16:43
Yup. A hedging strategy is good for mental health.
@_date: 2013-04-18 02:49:08
Grow a pair and live up go your agreement.
@_date: 2013-04-25 23:21:53


Or, at the least, be patient with your trading. Watch the market to get a sense of it before you trade. Buy a small amount of coins at a certain position and don't make another trade until you make a profit from that position (if you wait long enough, you likely will eventually). Don't trade when you haven't read the news and know what's going on. Don't go "all in": keep a balance of cash and BTC so you can take advantage of unexpected conditions.
@_date: 2013-04-15 02:18:16
You're talking about transfers, not trades.
@_date: 2013-04-16 08:08:55
The "no more Bitcoins" makes it sound as if he's written it off long-term.
@_date: 2013-04-18 18:14:50


Tokens that can be exchanged for money. I'm wondering how that's different from Bitcoin? Perhaps there is no way to transfer XRP ownership without exchanging it to a local currency.
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:00:57
Haha, yeah true. I just wanted to bang something out fast for personal use then make it less annoying. I'm working on making the base tone adjustable right now. Adding activation on certain price conditions is definitley something that would be useful though.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:21:50
Limited supply is built into the coin and if a new market can be cracked there'll be a new demand spike. So we'll see.
