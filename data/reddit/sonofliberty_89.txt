If you want Bitcoin to succeed, stop desperately begging companies to take your Bitcoin. Instead, tell them they fu*king can't have any of them.
@_date: 2014-09-30 13:59:17
Sure. Just saying, a discount doesn't seem to be enough incentive to get into Bitcoin. :-)

Also Bitcoin has no "deflationary properties". Deflation is the reduction of the money supply which will never happen with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-03 09:03:53
Right. If you destroy money, the supply is reduced. But how is that a property of Bitcoin? Oh right, it's not.
@_date: 2014-08-30 15:25:28

How can you call the fee appropiate when the amount of transactions is artifically limited? It's price controls.

Getaddr.bitnodes.io sees my node, but it has only 8 connections. What now?
@_date: 2016-03-01 13:00:34
Right. I never did a 0 fee transaction. Always added some fees, never a problem. Now it just got more expensive and less reliable. Like everything else controlled by central planners.
@_date: 2016-03-03 07:56:34


I call it manipulation.
@_date: 2016-03-04 16:41:12

@_date: 2016-03-05 10:00:03
@_date: 2016-03-01 14:38:58
The difference is that businesses are running nodes because they probably use them to send and receive transactions etc. This is how they profit from running a node. They build their services on top of bitcoind, which means they would be running nodes either way.
@_date: 2016-03-01 12:53:15
Paying is not the drama. The blocksize limit is.
@_date: 2016-03-01 05:33:41
Did you read my comment?
@_date: 2016-03-01 14:10:39
So you want "big corps and other centralized entities" to receive subsidies for running nodes? What sense would that make?
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:56:32
No shit, demand for bigger blocks is rising.
@_date: 2016-03-01 14:02:44

So you start your "argument" with an ad hominem? Who is supposed to take your position seriously now?
@_date: 2017-03-19 13:06:54
Pro tip: Send bank notes via the postal service! Cheaper and sometimes even faster than a bitcoin transaction.
@_date: 2017-03-30 14:04:24
Still cheaper than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-03-04 10:37:25
With an adjusted blocksize limit this wouldn't have happened in the first place.
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:52:53
This must be the final non-argument.
@_date: 2017-08-07 18:27:45
Just reduce the maximum blocksize to 300kb. This will obviously solve the problem.
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:00:40
Meanwhile a 4.7MB block was mined.

Tell everyone sending low-fee transactions to switch to BCH. This will keep BTC decentralized.
@_date: 2017-08-16 12:29:16
You can exchange your garbage BCH via ViaBTC or Shapeshift. Don't forget to include a $0.001 fee to get your transaction confirmed in the next block. :-)

Bitcoin Cash isn't taking the lead. The lead is being handed over by the small blockers by making Bitcoin utterly useless.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:04:28
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:21:14
Well no, I'm not telling people what to do with their money. I like Bitcoin to be like cash. You should be able to hodl it of course, but it should also be EASILY spendable which means it should be virtually free to transact. I just did a BCH transaction yesterday and paid a $0.003 fee (299 satoshis). This is how BTC worked a few years ago when I found out about it.
So yeah, I hope I answered your question.

You don't get the point. That's exactly the point.
@_date: 2016-02-29 17:17:34
I didn't recommend Bitcoin for a while now. It would be too embarassing to tell people you can't count on your transaction to go through within an hour, even when including fees WHILE there are other cryptocurrencies perfectly able to do so.

@_date: 2017-05-18 17:49:12


Well, I operate a node and having larger blocks doesn't seem like such a burden compared to the **HUNDRETS OF DOLLARS OF TRANSACTION FEES** I am currently paying on a weekly basis.
Listen I'm not against LN or any other 2nd layer solution. But it seems like the arbitrary blocksize limit is used to artificially create demand for it. Nah thanks.
@_date: 2017-05-11 09:13:11
Full blocks, high fees and complex 2nd layer solutions to the artificially sustained problem create a massive overhead. Of course developers will try to use alternatives to bitcoin instead.

@_date: 2017-05-16 21:04:48
Evil Jihan is actually trying to increase the blocksize, which would cause the glorious backlog to diminish. As we all know, full blocks are very good for Bitcoin (Greg said so), and an ever-increasing backlog means full blocks forever!

Having large amounts of unconfirmed transactions is a good thing because it guarantees full blocks, which are good. Greg Maxwell said so.
@_date: 2015-03-22 11:41:25
There is.
@_date: 2017-05-14 15:49:42
Miners are users too.

Satoshi isn't perfect. He was wrong about a couple of things, like implementing a 1MB hard limit on the block size.
@_date: 2017-06-15 07:53:48
Yes, UASF is actually a joke
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:37:06
Did Satoshi also tell you to insult everyone trying to explain something?
@_date: 2017-06-25 10:46:29
$0.26 is still exorbitant.
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:51:02
They should post links to Shapeshift instead.
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:30:01
Thank god Bitmain is a reasonable mining operation instead.
@_date: 2017-06-25 18:50:17
No. With full blocks transacting on the bitcoin blockchain has become a competition. We compete against each other for the artificially limited block space. And if I can outcompete you by paying a slightly higher fee, then so be it until I find a better solution of transferring value alltogether.
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:43:45
Sure they can. Or they install a SPV wallet within seconds instead of syncing the blockchain for hours or days. Incentives matter.
@_date: 2017-06-14 12:59:07
Bitcoin was created to cut off intelligently profit-seeking miners?
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:01:17


Oh yeah you hate to be the one to say this. Because nobody ever said this on this sub right? Can't make this s*** up.
@_date: 2017-06-13 11:03:56


Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:40:25
Nah, they're just making sure to pay a "high enough fee". Exactly what this sub and core devs have been telling everyone to do.
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:44:04
Exchanges and wallet providers don't signal anything. That's what miners do. You know? Like Bitmain.
@_date: 2017-06-13 10:23:52
How is "not running at capacity" untested?
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:53:54
If BIP148 survival is certain, why do you advise people to sell their BTC on the other chain in order to help BIP148 succeed?
@_date: 2017-06-25 17:31:54
Sure, the wallets will still build the transaction. But the user would get to decide the fee rate. Let's say I set the fee to 10,000 sat/B by accident. Boom, money lost. This will make adoption even more painful as it already is. Besides, users shouldn't worry about the friggin' fees anyway. Worked very well for years.
@_date: 2017-06-25 17:29:16
Good luck with your reeducation. Won't work without cheap transactions. Humans respond to incentives.
@_date: 2017-06-13 11:09:44
Can't buy shit? Can't disrupt shit.
@_date: 2017-06-25 19:39:16
I assume Coinbase does not create a TX from every single customer withdrawal request. Instead they would collect multiple payouts to put them in one TX to save on block space and fees. Since they serve multiple customers with one TX, you don't get to use a fee of your choosing.
@_date: 2017-06-25 12:13:15
With Litecoin you pay almost nothing to "record an uncensorable transaction to a global, immutable ledger". Saying words like uncensorable, global or immutable doesn't make it dirt cheap.
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:26:37
Everyone can run a node on a computer. But not everyone will, because there is a more simple and efficient solution out there for the average user: SPV.
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:24:31
It depends on the size of a transaction. $1.50 may be enough for a transaction with a single input. If you don't know what I'm talking about, please read up on how a bitcoin transaction is built.
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:16:24
So what? I just paid $6.90 TX fees to send ~$230 worth of bitcoin. Kraken's measures are legit.
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:39:50
If we only applied this standard to every group of developers.. hmmm..
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:37:57
I run a full node as well, since 2014. I'm a developer and like using it for sending and receiving BTC in an automated manner.
Not saying users shouldn't be running nodes or anything. I would say the cost benefit analysis doesn't add up. There is just no point for an average user to run a full node.
@_date: 2017-06-25 15:18:19
I remember the bitcoin community warning noobs about manually building their transactions since one little mistake could result in significant financial losses.
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:02:16
People are competing for limited block space regardless of the size of the mempool.
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:29:53
Of course a forest doesn't really exist. But we say 'forest' to refer to a collection of individual trees within a certain area.
@_date: 2017-06-09 04:14:37
How about no
@_date: 2017-06-13 05:32:45
I don't have any ETH, but maybe I should look into it. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-06-25 12:07:09
Sure. I'm also "more than happy" to pay $30 for a few slices of bread if that's all I will get for the rest of the week.
@_date: 2017-06-25 19:10:46
Yes. I love financial software with lots of warning messages. To the moon!
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:29:14
**YOU GUYS** told everyone to "**just pay a high enough fee**" to get their transactions confirmed. This is the result of limited block space and everyone paying a "high enough fee".
@_date: 2017-06-25 18:38:21
r/bitcoin: "Just pay a high enough fee if you want your TX to confirm quickly"... also r/bitcoin: "Stop paying 390  sat/B!!1"
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:09:03
I see. I would prefer exchanges and wallet providers following the longest chain instead.
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:24:48
Just promoting Segwit2x won't stop UASF, which is their goal.
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:44:55
What kind of signal is that? Anyone can run a bunch of nodes signalling this or that. Easily faked.
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:40:41
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:31:47
They literally say they won't do a HF if Segwit2x is activated.
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:16:40
You understand why most people won't go through that process when they could use a SPV wallet instead?
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:40:38

Mike Hearn, Gavin Andresen and others warned about this exact situation years ago and this sub hated them for telling the truth. At some point, all the smart people left the ship so there are only idiots left.
