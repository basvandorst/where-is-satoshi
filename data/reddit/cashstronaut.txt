I'm not incorrect. No consumer pays for anyhting and then ponders how long until the merchant gets paid. Nobody cares. It's all about the consumer experience, and for Bitcoin that means waiting for at least 1 confirmation but probably 6 or 8

The short answer is actually yes. It isn't trivial for bots to do the same thing now because the bots on Gox were making large buys with money they didn't actually have. You can't do that with a bot now unless you run the exchange, and with the current regulatory eye on Bitcoin nobody wants to go to jail for manipulating the market. Sand Hill Exchange just got fined for fake bookkeeping. 
Willy Bot was a bot that stimulated demand. It simulated a large whale continuously buying Bitcoins at increasing prices and created a lot of FOMO. 
I think most bitcoiners are in agreeance that Willy Bot was real and have a serious hand in creating demand in that time period for news in China hampered the demand.

It's really easy to say "Incorrect" or "Wrong" without bothering to explain. 
a 0 confirmation transaction is as good as a cheque you threw in the vague direction of the retailer you meant to pay but still have the ability to scoop up - worthless. Every bitcoin developer agrees that you should wait for confirmations to confirm payment.

No, you send a transaction to one address with a certain fee or no fee and then another transaction to a different address with a higher fee. The transaction with the higher fee gets picked up, the transaction with no fee is "doublespent"
Now, like you said in the OP, it *looks* like you made a transaction, but it never actually confirms. The money goes elsewhere. This is why you can't think of 0 confirmations as a transaction occurring and why Bitcoin isn't capable of "inifnite" TPS (or even ten TPS right now)
@_date: 2015-06-08 00:28:20
No, you dense fool, I'm talking about completed transactions. They've checked that the consumer has enough credit and agreed to pay the merchant. That's a completed transaction as far as consumers are concerned, which is all that matters.

No, it means "money cleared". Merchants wait days for their money because consumers use credit cards, merchants *exist* to serve customers. It hardly matters to consumers when merchants receive payment for something they bought with credit. 
If you're going to argue that bitcoin is "cleared and spendable" in ten minutes you have to also consider the time it takes to convert bitcoins into actual spendable fiat, because certainly no merchant vendors accept BTC nor can they remit taxes in it.

The entire goddamn article is about microtransactions *on the blockchain* dude. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 01:25:48
Okay, I get the discrepancy here. 
See, in your fantasy land, consumers are actually allowed to leave the premises with 0 confirmations. In reality, they are not. That's the difference. With Visa you are paid and out the door, with Bitcoin you are waiting at the counter for ten minutes. 
(and, again, let me just interject before you even start - if a third-party is allowing a consumer to enjoy their purchase with 0 transactions that's not bitcoin. That's a simple third party ledger. The merchant probably isn't getting any Bitcoins in the end, the transaction has nothing to do with the Bitcoin Blockchain, **that's not bitcoin**)
To say "no confirmation are required" is completely disingenuous. Consumers need them before they can leave the premises with their goods and merchants need them before they can reliably consider themselves paid.

First of all, Overstock no longer actually retains any BTC and converts all BTC paid to BitPay into USD. This happened after the claimed a $117,000 loss in Q1 2015 selling their cryptocurrency holdings from 2014. This is verifiable on their Q1 2015 balance sheets
Second, what do you expect, 1% off? Overstock, as a large retailer, isn't paying anywhere near 3% per transaction to Visa/MC. They likely pay between 1.15 and 1.5%, so BitPay charging them 1% isn't exactly affording them enough to offer you a discount. 
@_date: 2015-06-07 19:09:47

And for the fourth (and last) time - the merchant doesn't matter. What matters if the consumers - they are the ones using the cards and paying for goods. I don't know what is so difficult for you to comprehend about that absolute fact. 
If a transaction is confirmed on Visa's end that means the merchant can count on being paid. The few days between then and the payment is irrelevant to the consumer. Aside from the fairly low incidence rate of chargebacks they can count on that money being available as much as they can count on the sun rising. 
The alternative is to not accept the long delays of credit card payments (and indeed not accept credit cards at all) and lose their business to competitors willing to undergo this enormous hassle. 
I'm not trying to be rude, but you're being willfully dense now - nobody cares about the merchant delay. VISA serves consumers and enables merchants. In fact, not even bitcoiners care about this delay you're insisting is important, considering every Bitcoin debit card operates the same as a credit card with the same delay and they're happy to have them. 
What matters in business is how fast a consumer can get a receipt and their shopping and leave. For Visa that is dozens of thousands every second, for Bitcoin that is less than a dozen per second. 
@_date: 2015-06-07 17:05:27

So you expect Bitcoin miners to be happy about suddenly earning 99.6% less money? You can't foresee any economical problems with this economy losing damn near 100% of the stimulus that actually keeps it running? 
What if the network loses 99% of it's hashpower accordingly? The difficulty will go down but people who invested millions in miners aren't going to shut down overnight. If you don't pay higher transaction fees your transaction hangs in limbo for days. 
I know how easy it is to hand-wave away these problems without thinking critically about them but it's dangerous to do so. It's incredibly naive to just presume difficulty will drop and bitcoin will continue forward with no issues.

21's business plan is an absolute catastrophe. People are frantically trying to make sense of such a stupid idea with ideas (like yours) for non-related subsidies and pissing away revenue.

@_date: 2015-05-17 18:44:28


That's your opinion, and that's fine. I don't personally think it's that ridiculous, if there was no block reward then actual fees would be substantially higher overnight so it's at least partially relevant imo


Dude, that's exactly what that means. If the price of bitcoins goes up the block reward becomes more valuable and the network is essentially giving away more money. Similarly, users paying 1 satoshi per transaction are now sending more money (in USD) in that satoshi. Either way you slice it the transactions *are* more expensive. 


There's no guarantee it will be worth 100 times as much. This is simply dismissing the problem on the hope that bitcoins will be worth $20,000 in the 2030's which is not impossible but in no way assured


If the reward per block will not be less then people will be paying $12 per transaction...that's unfortunately not a competitive rate.

Why? There's no guarantee of this happening. If offering 10% off means more consistent business then those companies would do it all the time with or without 21's partnership. 
Your suggestion is totally ridiculous dude. Companies don't typically offer consistent 10% sale prices because if they did that may as well be the regular price, and they certainly aren't going to subsidize their products because an unrelated bitcoin company is mining 10 cents a month on people's phones.

It's incredibly misleading though. 51% "of those participating in bitcoin" is thousands and thousands more people than the few people who collectively control 51% of the bitcoin mining network
If 99/100 people own bitcoins and 1/100 mine bitcoins that 1% gets to decide what happens to bitcoins. 
@_date: 2015-05-18 14:54:23
Not entirely true. Miners derive a small percentage (less than 1%) of their revenue from tx fees. If transaction fees rose then miners would make more money even with a falling bitcoin price
Considering in 20 years there will be effectively no more block reward transaction fees are going to become more and more important.

If a company *should not* do *x* lest they lose their business, no reasonable person ought to argue that it's not true they also *must* not do *x*. You're being a whiny, semantic little baby and I can hardly believe you find stuff like this worth arguing about. 
Like, if someone told you that you *must* not run over people with your car, do you argue that it's technically *should*? If doing *x* means going out of business then it's past a *should* and absolutely a *must*, you whiny, insufferable loser.

You've really come full circle here, haven't you? A dozen posts misunderstanding the topic and putting words in my mouth and finally you calm down and actually want to understand? Shocked. 


I mean that if Circle or Coinbase are "hacked" and no negligence is proven then your liability is limited to the LIMITED LIABILITY section of your TERMS OF SERVICE, which last I checked entitle you to 3 months worth of fees paid MAXIMUM. 
Do you understand yet, you condescending asshole? 
Please bear in mind i'm not talking about the status of LIMITED LIABILITY CORPORATIONS. I want to make sure you don't make the same mistake twice because you certainly seem dense enough to. And again, for the seventh time, I've said nothing of negligent losses (though even limited liability in cases of negligence can occasionally be enforced depending on circumstances)

I'm pretty sure the interac transfers can't be reversed after they've been accepted, so your "final" time would be immediately or -as long as it takes the other person to hit "accept"- depending on how you want to look at it
It's actually a pretty neat system, I'm fairly certain every major bank in Canada offers this option between each other as well. 
More to your point, we have to consider perspective when talking about these confirmation times. As a consumer, to me, retail transactions take less than 10 seconds to be "final". I tap an NFC-connected debit or credit card to a terminal and I can walk away with my food immediately. I understand for a merchant to get their payment may take several days after the fact but merchants are only accepting credit cards and debit cards and delayed payments because shoppers will go elsewhere if they don't. This isn't a merchant-driven decision, it's customer-centric. Customers don't realistically care how long it takes the merchant to get paid.

The alternative is actually that the block reward diminishes, transaction fees skyrocket and bitcoin becomes less desirable and competitive. Miners (will eventually) have a very strong incentive to modify the 21 million limit when they lose their paycheque (the block reward) and start having to live on scraps (fees)
It's kind of a no-brainer for miners to hop on (and secure) a new blockchain with an extra million or so coins, the only people who would really resist are those hoping to make it rich off their "scarce" digital coins.

They have an obligation to shareholders, you know. McDonalds **must** not make customers wait a long time. 
While this is an argument about semantics and pedantry, you're still wrong. Not only are proper business practices a *should* for companies, they are a *must* in order to stay in business. Companies exist in order to do business, after all. It's not just a suggestion or an idea but completely imperative that McDonalds follow best practices. 
Nobody would suggest Ford *should* build safe cars. Ford *must* build safe cars. If they don't they go out of business, so it's beyond a suggestion or a good idea. The decision becomes, without question, a must. 
You **must** eat to live. Pedantic people like yourself and theiflar will bother to waste their time arguing that sustenance is a "should", but the alternative is death. A company going out of business is death, therefore practices that keep them in business (or improve profitability) are a must.

Now, keep in mind miners right now make **99%** of their money from the block reward. Less than 1% from fees.

Yeah, like your rights to freedom. Limited liability for a corporation is **super fucking common** and **totally legal**. You aren't forced to use their services and have an opportunity to read and agree to or decline their TOS so I have no idea why you think that wouldn't be legally binding. 
Negligence has little to do with typical limited liability clauses. If they weren't negligent in receiving the losses then there's no reason the ToS wouldn't apply, but a fun fact for you - the Gox ToS **specifically mentioned losses incurred due to negligence**

It's hard to predict, and a touchy subject for many
Right now miners get less than one half of one percent of their revenue from fees. Bitcoin's big attention-grabbing feature is supposed to be low/no fees and cheaper remittances, among other things. 
The block reward subsidy is, for all intents and purposes, done in 20 years. 99.x% of all bitcoins will be mined by early the early 2030's. If things go as planned, adoption grows to offset the lost subsidy and miners make roughly the same money they do now but derived completely from transaction fees
If adoption doesn't pick up there's a chance that transaction fees won't be enough to offset the lost block reward. If this is the case (and likely far earlier) the network will lose miners and hashpower, though this isn't necessarily the end of bitcoin. 
To answer your question, I personally think it is fairly likely that there is at some point a push for an increased block reward as miners determine transaction fees are nowhere near enough to sustain current operations. 
In any event, we'll see how this plays out within 20 years. Exciting!
@_date: 2015-05-30 19:42:46

Blockchain.info calls it the exact same thing:


I realize this isn't a fee actually paid per transaction by users but rather a calculation of the cost per transaction of the network *including the block reward*
The reason it's relevant is that miners rely heavily on the block reward for revenue (to pay bills). From the same above blockchain.info page you can see that miners only get **0.28%** of their revenue from actual transaction fees paid. People actually using bitcoin are only paying transaction fees of less than 1% of the aforementioned "cost per transaction" because this revenue stream is totally insignificant compared to the block reward everybody is racing for. 
In 20 years the block reward will be 99% gone so it's pretty important to consider what the true transaction fees will be once miners have lost more than 99% of the revenue they pay bills with 
@_date: 2015-05-19 20:43:24
Of course I do, solely by transaction fees at that point.
Do you know how much of miner's revenue transaction fees are now? It's less than 1 percent. So 20 years from now when the block reward is basically gone (99%), miners will solely rely on transaction fees
