Technically, you're right.
But in the payments world, this type of transaction would be classified as 'consumer-to-business'.
An example of 'person-to-person' is me sending $100 to you via PayPal or Western Union.
In the chair example, you are selling me a good in exchange for a good, thus the bi-directional dynamic. In the PP/WU example, I am sending you money in exchange for nothing, thus uni-directional.

Ripple protocol (RTXP): The protocol was open-sourced last year (
Ripple currency (XRP): Your best bet for learning more is to check out 
That said, the point of Ripple as a protocol is to improve payments in **any** currency - the focus is not on XRP. I think this article does an awesome job of highlighting how people are succeeding trading BTC over Ripple.

Bilateral because I am trading you money for a chair, i.e. the transaction requires payment in both directions.
A donation is unilateral because my sending money to Red Cross doesn't obligate Red to send me anything.

I'm sorry, I don't understand your point. If you can, please rephrase more concisely.

What guarantee will you have that the merchant honors the refund? This service is provided by CC/PP.


You didn't answer my question - here it is again: What are the fees to buy BTC in the first place? What are the fees (mining, etc.) required to process a payment? CC companies and PP offer many consumer protections - does Bitcoin offer these at no cost?


What about the risk of getting hacked? You may be savvy enough to custody your own funds. But normally people keep their money with a bank instead of a mattress because the security risks of the latter are inarguably high.


My last comment about card security addresses this point. 
There are definitely securer alternatives to cards - QR, EMV, etc. - but these have nothing to do with the underlying funds, i.e. the security of the point-of-sale-layer is currency-agnostic.


Again, this issue is currency-agnostic. Some people need to pay in cash because merchants don't accept cards.
Your question holds true with dollars: Why use cash instead of a card? Because the merchant doesn't accept cards. Bitcoin doesn't solve this question.
That said, compare the ATM fees for USD vs. BTC: 
-ATM fees are normally $0-4/txn depending on your card issuer. 
-BTC fees are up to 7%/txn (source: 


Comparing the cryptography of Bitcoin and the security of cards is to compare apples to oranges: 
-Bitcoin cryptography concerns the integrity of the currency, not the actual payment at the point-of-sale. In other words, Bitcoin cryptography assures the value of a BTC in the same way the Federal Reserve assures the value of a USD.
-The security of the payment instrument (e.g. a credit card) is intrinsic to the instrument, not the currency. Even in a world on Bitcoin, these risks remain.
That said, I'm open to being convinced otherwise.

It sounds like you're saying that you avoid tipping because you ascribe value to BTC as money rather than a worthless object. In other words, you never intended to actually tip / transfer real value to the recipient. 
If that's the case, then you were never actually tipping in the past. 
The lesson here seems to be less about the value of BTC than your own generosity, i.e.
 you were previously acting selfishly, and now disguising selfish behavior with an ostensible lesson about how BTC - not you - has changed. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 21:14:35
And just to be clear, I fully support Bitcoin and the general concept of math-backed payment systems.
The reason I raise these concerns is because ignoring them could materially damage adoption of these types of systems. I urge the community to take these points seriously, and then think critically about them.
I understand that anyone can respond with a logical counter-argument, but hope no one resorts to  for the sake of trying to appear correct. 
It's easy to find comfort sitting in an echo chamber. The risk, however, is failure to ever move.

P2P: Sure, person-to-person transactions also fall into the 'unilateral payments' category. I agree. This may be a fundamental improvement on the current system.
Cost of risk: Consumer protection come at a cost. Sure, some merchants are still bad. Credit cards help distribute the risk of these bad actors across the entire system (interchange). Does Bitcoin have an equivalent model for distributing this type of risk? If not, than Bitcoin likely falls short compared with the current system.
Will bad merchants survive: Most won't in today's world, or in a Bitcoin-world. The difference is today's Bitcoin-world is likely less efficient as screening out these bad actors.
"Credit cards... rip you off": Let me rephrase: Fraud is a persistent risk no matter the system. The difference is how each system handles risk. My point is that the comment highlighting the value of tipping (unilateral payment) doesn't address the original posters' concerns about risks involving bilateral payments. 
Credit card fraud happens "often": Your assertion has shades of observation bias: Based on several incidents with credit card fraud shared by a group biased against credit cards, you're concluding that credit card fraud happens more often than may actually be the case. I don't know the real statistics, but want to point out that your assertion lacks substantial evidence.
CC vs. Bitcoin fraud: Your credit card authentication details are tantamount to your Bitcoin authentication details. If your authentication details are compromised, you're susceptible to fraud. In a Bitcoin-world, these transactions are irreversible, leaving the consumer on the hook. In today's world, CC transactions are reversible, and in cases of non-reversibility, consumers are protected by the card association.
To summarize:
I agree that Bitcoin may improve unilateral payments (per the commenter), but do not see strong evidence supporting the claim that Bitcoin improves bilateral payments (per the original poster).
@_date: 2014-03-16 19:04:02
Fraud exists as long as bad actors exist. 
"Fraud protection" is insurance against the impact of fraud, ie compensation in the case of an unforeseen event. 
Insurance is only effective when the costs and benefits are distributed across a massive pool of participants, thus making the probability of such events easier to measure. 
There are ~2B card account holders, ie broad distribution of risk. 
In short, credit cards provide consumer benefits spread across a massively distributed payment system. 
This sounds similar to bitcoin, except with fifty years of sophistication behind it.

You're right - you didn't say that. I recant. 
That said, here is my point: 
Your comment highlights the utility of bitcoin for unilateral payments such as tipping and donations. By unilateral, I mean that the payment by you does not require subsequent fulfillment of a good by the receiver. I think this is a great use case. 
On the other hand, the original poster raises questions about the utility of bitcoin for bilateral transactions, eg when you pay a merchant and expect to receive goods in return. 
Normally a credit card offers protections to the consumer in case the merchant happens to be a bad actor and doesn't give you what you paid for. In the case of bitcoin, there is no common such recourse. This may leave a lot of consumers on the hook since not every merchant can be trusted. 
These types of protections come at a cost - what credit card associations call interchange. Even though credit card interchange may be too high, it's hard to say that it will go to zero, unless you can confidently say that consumer protections will be provided at zero cost. 
To summarize:
Bitcoin and other decentralized, math-backed currencies may be great for unilateral transaction such as tipping and donations. 
The same - as the original poster articulates - may not be true for bilateral transactions such as purchasing merchandise or services.

That's interesting, but I don't understand exactly what you're saying.
Can you explain specifically how M-Pesa would implement what you're describing?
@_date: 2014-03-17 03:35:53
You're using the term P2P incorrectly in the context you describe.
A P2P payment is unilateral transfer from one person to another - this doesn't involve a commercial exchange (e.g. buying a chair).
You're describing a commercial transaction, which falls under C2C or C2B (definitions:  which aligns with what I have been saying.

 chargebacks: Doesn't this leave the consumer on the hook? Disputes are important for a functional payment ecosystem. The ability to charge back a payment is essential to a dispute system.
 fees: What are the fees to buy BTC in the first place? What are the fees (mining, etc.) required to process a payment? CC companies and PP offer many consumer protections - does Bitcoin offer these at no cost?
 bank required to hold funds: A lot of people kept a lot money with MTGOX instead of a bank. Do you think these people would have preferred to have kept this money with a bank instead of MTGOX?
 card: Debit cards are widely accepted by merchants. What's wrong with holding one?

No, my argument was not hinging on the chair-sale being unilateral. 
Purchasing a chair involves a bilateral transaction. Just because you're a person (providing the chair) and I'm a person (providing the money) doesn't make it a person-to-person transaction.
It appears you don't understand my logic: Please re-read the thread.
