Me too.  If I don’t then I’m a spy.

I bet we're going to jump to 20-22k here soon as word gets out.
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:04:54
And you know it’ll dip hard... aside from a typical correction...how?
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:08:35
It's clickbait, hype and FUD.  I know this all too well in the Tesla world.

Your comments don’t seem to change much. Seen the same comment like 3 times...
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:04:29
Nope. Correct one. Approved! :-D
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:28:11
I’d gild you if I wasn’t on mobile right now.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:41:13
:-D nice. Tesla is my Lambo ;)
@_date: 2018-09-08 02:05:08
Clearly you didn’t watch shit. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 17:09:47
Tesla is my Lambo, I’m picking up my Model 3 on Monday. 
@_date: 2018-09-08 12:35:08
Found the 15 year old

Tesla is my Lambo
@_date: 2018-09-01 22:44:35
Tesla is my Lambo. Arriving this month! w00t!!
@_date: 2018-09-01 22:45:31
What type of Lambo is it?  The model name?  Anyone know?
@_date: 2018-06-13 01:28:47
Isn’t that the opposite of what you’d want in trying to get people to accept you as an up and coming entrant of new technology?
@_date: 2018-06-13 01:35:36
Understood but Bitcoin is still “the” Cryptocurrency so it looks odd.  Is there bad blood there?
@_date: 2018-06-13 01:52:24
I guess I just need to look at it from a Bitcoin perspective. I wouldn’t personally consider r/CC a non-bitcoin sub simply because it isn’t Bitcoin I guess. It’s still a crypto currency.. which is where my question arises from. I understand your opinion from an external altcoin perspective but I was more so focused on the association, or disassociation in the sidebar, as it were. No biggie, just trying to understand.
Thanks :)

...I don’t know what that means...
@_date: 2018-06-13 01:34:06
I mod a sub of 270k+ people, I know what trolling is, I don’t think he’s trolling.  But your other explanation makes sense.
@_date: 2018-11-15 17:26:31
Same :)
@_date: 2018-11-15 13:43:59
As a Tesla owner, it’s my “lambo”.  Hell, not too bad with one in space already :)
@_date: 2018-07-21 23:19:21
Now all you need is a Tesla to charge with your solar (or whatever plugin you like). 
@_date: 2018-04-21 11:10:58
visa vi ergo!
@_date: 2018-04-18 04:58:16
Tesla is my BMW/Lambo. 
@_date: 2019-05-13 13:23:29
I think Cryptocurrency as a whole would be better.
