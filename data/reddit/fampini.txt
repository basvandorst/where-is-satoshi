Read up on paper wallets. If you have a serious amount look up getting a hardware wallet if you want to feel truly safe. Ledger nano S is a good option.

This guy checks

Yes but they will be listed separately. It is for you to decide whether to sell or hold your new coins.

They apply new rules going forward that the old coin treats as invalid. See the hard fork section [here](

That would depend on where your coins are stored. If they aren't in a paper wallet or with coinbase, I would check with the provider of your software/hardware wallet. Otherwise you're sorted already.

Yes unless you are using a wallet that has stated they are only using the new coin. I don't know any that are doing that though

The evidence from previous forks shows us Bitcoin has always recovered. If you believe in bitcoin and are here long term, the important thing to remember is short term drops in value aren't bad, they're just a chance to buy more at a cheaper price. You've only lost money if you sell your bitcoin. If the new coin is treated as a chance for people to sell, I imagine many will reinvest that money into more bitcoin and we will see the price continue to rise.

I know a little. It is to do with a dispute about the size of the 'blocks' in the blockchain. New coin wants them to be much bigger. Downside of this is they will take longer to process per block which discourages small time miners. 
The other problem is, well, if its a copy of bitcoin but different then is it no longer bitcoin? The value of the new coin will depend whether people dump it or hold and use it.

Largely true although ETH is looking promising because of it's practical applications.

I wrote an ELI5 higher up, hopefully it helps.

Some developers decided they wanted to change the bitcoin core code to improve it. Not everyone agreed. The code change was so big it required a seperate coin that was intended to be used instead of the old one. Coinbase has decided to list this as a different coin instead of replacing the old bitcoin.When the new coin arrives, you will hold the same amount of it as you do of bitcoin because they are essentially copy and pasting your balance.

It's a new block chain but also a copy of what was already there. Imagine a 'forking' path. They share the same history but different futures.

That would be a big decision for you to make. A lot of people advise not to permanently store your coins on coinbase. You are putting your money out of your control (imagine if a government ordered them to block all accounts). Remember the key is to always minimise risk. You will have access to the new coin if you store offline too. If you do choose to store offline I would recommend using the guides about paper wallets or hardware wallets first.

Your address and secret will work with both the old and new coin then.

Yes. The mistake would be selling it at $10000 though, because it will only increase further long term. A lot of newcomers use coinbase to buy bitcoins - you can get the app on your device. If you plan on buying a lot of bitcoin, look into some security options too. There are plenty of resources on this sub that can help you with that.

I've copied what I said above to help you
