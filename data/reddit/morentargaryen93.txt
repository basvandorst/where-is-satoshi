What exactly do you mean by going extinct?
When will people stop investing into it or when will people stop using it?
This is really important because it's not the same thing.
Why would "world powers" support something they can't control. Why would they support something that could make traditional banks completely useless and unnecessary? I am pretty sure they will never support any cryptocurrency which hasn't been created by themselves and being controlled by themselves. But anyway, bitcoin got where it is today without any support from governments. So why shouldn't it be able to stay there?
You are right about the competition. But you should have made that point back in 2017 when btc dominance was around 30%. Because right now it is nearly at 70%, so it is basically swallowing most of its competition. Sure this could change again in the future. But it won't probably happen anytime soon.

Re governments:
Depends on which country you're talking about. 
It has already been banned in a few countries. 
China for example, which obviously is huge. 
But the EU is open to it and it looks like the US won't ban it. 
Re competition:
There are already tons of cryptocurrencies that are faster, more private, more secure and easier to use than bitcoin.
And so far none of them got even close to reach bitcoins market cap.
I assume people just tend to believe more in bitcoin since it is around for so long 
All I want to say is that at the moment bitcoin seems far away from becoming irrelevant or going extinct. You made some good assumptions about what could happen in the future to change that. But there is nothing that suggests that these things are certainly going to happen. 
You could also ask when will bitcoin hit 1 Million dollars instead of when will it go extinct. Both events are very unlikely at the moment.
