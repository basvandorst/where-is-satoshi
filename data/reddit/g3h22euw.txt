BTC would have cost ~$20
Don't worry. Lightning will fix this.
Either that or you could use Segwit. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:34:44
Useless until LN arrives or BitPay accepts Segwit.

I already did. like several months ago.
Now i own some Bitcoin Cash.
But even then I'm keeping a small amount. The real buy in for BCH is when Bitcoin bursts and takes down the whole market, then i can grab me up some cheap sub ~$100-$500 BCH.

The difference is I don't have respect for people who make mistakes like this. Death is final. This fucker will have to live with his stupidity. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 19:20:39
Comparing death to financial irresponsibility is false equivalence. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 15:25:29
Why don't you use Dash, LTC or gbyte?
@_date: 2018-05-09 22:57:15
Lol. It's just about getting more wealth with you guys. Not adoption. 
Have fun day trading unregulated crypto and HOODELING for that 'lambo.

Right now, they'd all starve to death waiting weeks for their $100 transaction fee transactions to confirm on the network.
Either that or merchants would accept 0-conf to compensate and lose millions every day to double-spends. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 15:53:09


Your joking right? BCH has far more adoption than any other crypto. The only ones still using BTC are holdovers from the old days that haven't moved on yet. 
The only thing you need right now to run a node is a hard drive and a semi-decent internet connection. 1 TB hard drives are cheap as fuck, and 20+ mbit internet is almost standard in developed western countries. 
Ugandans with Rasberry Pi's don't need to run a node. There are hundreds of thousands of people in other nations that have the financial resources to do it for them. Even i can run a node on my laptop. 
The fear with centralization is control of the blockchain, and the barrier to entry simply isn't high enough to make that a credible threat.

You don't want more BTC lmao. You want more $$$. 
If you really wanted to get more BTC *gag* you could have rode the 300% Bytecoin pump this morning.
@_date: 2018-05-12 15:47:05
Lol, BTC has use in the real world? Any time people actually start using it to capacity it shits the bed with 50 USD fees and *weeks* to get into a block otherwise. 
*We* have several things going on, Memo.cash, yours.org, joystream, eatBCH etc. All of which are simply impossible on BTC. Not to mention most brick and mortar businesses refuse to accept BTC due to the fee and time debacle late 2017. 
LN has so many problems i can't even begin to cover all of them. All I'll say is that it's been 18 months away for the past few years and now that it's on mainnet it's still an alpha and is *losing* peoples money. 
Hate BCH all you want. But BTC is a dead coin, and you'll have to jump ship somewhere eventually. Ethereum, Dogecoin, Verge, Monero. But unless BTC changes, which it won't your on a sinking ship. 
Don't pretend like you have a clue. If you believe BTC in it's current state has a future, you clearly don't.
@_date: 2018-05-09 23:53:36
If it's so centralized who can censor my transactions?
Have any record of transactions being blocked by the "evil centralized Chinese" miners?
BCH doesn't have a leader. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 21:21:18
You keep telling yourself that.
@_date: 2018-05-12 15:29:15
Why *don't* you care about speed and cost?
@_date: 2018-05-09 17:54:18
*Insert whining about bcash*
@_date: 2018-05-12 16:24:27
LN and Segwit aren't the reason fees are down. Transaction count decreased after the December pump and subsequent crash.
I have dumped all my BTC. I exclusively use BCH now, and have advised everyone i know to switch. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 16:07:41
Is there any justifiable reason they charge so much for the BTC fee compared to BCH or is there political bias at play?
@_date: 2018-03-15 14:44:54
Why are people upset with BitPay?
@_date: 2018-03-15 16:12:13
Hmm. What motive does BitPay and co. have for going against bitcoin?
It's essentially their only means of payment, and judging by the tx volume on BCH, Bitcoin still has more than majority market share. Talk about shooting themselves in the foot.
@_date: 2018-03-15 16:19:12
BitPay is going to run themselves in the ground trying to force BCH and BIP 70.
People use crypto as assets, not currencies. Making it harder for people to use BTC is going to turn a struggling company with little volume into a dying company with almost no volume.
Darwinism at it's finest it seems.
@_date: 2018-03-15 14:51:29
Yeah. BIP 70 is trash.
Not going to buy from them as long as that's mandatory. I use a ledger, and I'm not switching to bitpays wallet just to make a payment, nor will I demand ledger add bip 70 just because they are stubborn. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:43:21
Honestly they only have like what? 10-20% of the total hashpower?
Why don't we just do a 50% attack and take back our fucking coin?
Kill off Bcash and Bgold and make everyone who owns them including Ver and Jihan fucking cry.
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:42:55
Lol. Any "crackdown" will crash the crypto market if it goes through 
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:20:43
I'm from the future.
BTC is $6245 now. I'll update again when I wake up.
