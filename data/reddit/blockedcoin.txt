I misunderstand this response. I was not thought they have wallet backup file. but some people told me "every operation blockchain.info create new backup" via private message.
I send them my password and now i am waiting.

 I am not suicide yet. and blockchain.info still no response.
I read comments. thx. So in my case my new address was not synced blockchain.info server. so my address is disappeared but I can not understand that system. Why they show me address before synced? And I think this issue is not a first time and not only for me. why blockchain.info does not fix this problem.

I submitted before write this article but i think they ignore my first ticket. I make new ticket with new email address they answered now.
but this is not solution.
If the address is not shown within the web wallet's active or archived address tab it may yet be contained within a previous wallet backup file. However, in order to decrypt your wallet backup files to search if the address it would require you to provide your main wallet password. After resolution of this matter it will be recommended you create a new wallet with a new password and either transfer existing funds or import the bitcoin addresses.
