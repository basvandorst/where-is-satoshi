Because the mempool is empty and doesn't reach even 1MB within blocks.
My transaction confirmed today within 10 minutes with 10sat/B fee. ;)

Short term?Maybe, when diff dropped. Long term? Absolutely NO!
If the original Bitcoin as experiment will fail because of greedy miners(forks, mass hopping, prove something through PoW) the entire crypto ecosystem will collapse and everybody will lose.

Sorry for my english, but i need to answer to this after "read-only" for years. Luckily I made an account 2 weeks ago. so...
I'm the well informed "average Joe", an ordinary user and holder. I worked hard in the real world to earn some BTC in the last years, store at an offline cold wallet far from any computer. It is a chance for me to reach financial freedom within a decade. The price is rising, the adoption grows, more and more people respect it day by day, everything is going well. Yes, maybe the blocks are too small and we should talk about some solution. I won't dispute about what is the best solution, BUT:
This hard fork is clearly a messy things. Every poll about the support shows 50-50 or worse. In this case it's a threat for us. I don't care the goal of this hard fork. BTC is solid as rock now but if miners leave the original chain and half of the community use that, maybe both chain will die because nobody will know what's happening. The average Joe won't trust this "new thing"(cryptocurrencies), won't invest and slowly the full crypto ecosystem will collapse. Is it your goal? Do you want to take that risk?
Even if i need to pay 10 times higher fee it's better than lose everything if the worst case scenario happens.
Maybe it's an opportunity for a business man to pay less or control the codebase or whatever but for us, who are not millionaires it's the future. Don't play with that!

Don't forget the thing the block when the new ruleset will activated is 494784. We will have a difficulty adjustment at 493920 and 495936. So we need only 1152 blocks. If only 15% of hashrate stay at BTC we will reach the next retarget within 50 days.

This post is really cute. Are You think the block size is matter?
You can't convince him. Erik is NOT an idiot, he know what could happening if this hard fork won't success and pull bitcoin to the obilivion with the full crypto economy.
He takes that risk because if we following the Core team's vision, the atomic swaps will be reality sooner than you think and Erik's Shapeshift service will be doomed.

Nick Szabo who’s father fled communist Hungary and settled in the United States, were Szabo was born 51 years ago. "Szabo" is a very common hungarian last name that means "tailor". In that country the last name is the first one like "Szabo Nick", so that  is SN=SN ;)

The Core node has 8 connections at default. When somebody found a block your node need to verify and propagate it to 8 other nodes. In an ideal case You need to do that within ~10-20 seconds because if somebody find another block in that time that will be an orphan one. So if You want to upload a full "2MB block" with high Segwit count to 8 clients You need a connection with 100mbit UPLOAD at minimum. The HDD capacity does NOT a problem.

Miners went to play the hopping game to BCH. Our speed is only half of the original. Within 5 hours the diff will go up so they come back to mine BTC. Relax.

Next time use this site to set a manual fee.
 
The TXs filling the mempool and when somebody find a block it's dropping. Search the lowest fee what miners will do it within next couple blocks. 
Example: Now the miners isn't touch the upper gray(180-200 sat/B), so if you want a FAST transaction the right fee  is 221sat/B now. If You don't need to rush wait until miners finish that game at the other currency.
 When You sent that TX 48 hours ago the realistic fee was 15sat/B. You used 9sat/B. Your TX will go through when they reach the red one at bottom at tomorrow.(BCH diff will increase within 10 hours, so the miners come back)
