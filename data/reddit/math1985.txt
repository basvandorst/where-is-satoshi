I didn't mean that miners will stop mining, i thought you meant to say that.


Miners cannot just decide to raise fees. Miners optimize their profit by mining the transactions with the highest fees, even in these fees will be lower in the future.
Also, you can not *create* value on the 2nd layer.
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:05:18


This is incorrect. If miners stop mining, difficulty will go down, which will increase the amount of miners again.

Paying with my Maestro card has been working flawlessly across Europe for me. 
Maestro-cards never work online (Dutch/German banks have other solutions for that). Maestro-cards require reading the chip and entering a pincode, which obviously doesn't work with cards, so this is a feature and not a bug.

Not even necessary to send ltc from one exchange to the other. Simply doing btc-&gt;ltc on one exchange and ltc-&gt;btc on the other gives you a risk-free profit. Provided you have enough btc and ltc on the exchange of course. Doesn't even need to be ltc, works with btc &lt;-&gt; usd just the same.

Not sure why Reddit is so much against this? I didn't read the actual article, but this is the situation in the Netherlands: everyone has a social security number (actually called 'citizen service number'). Also everyone has a passport or European id card, which mentions the social security number. If you do business with the government in person, you show your passport or id card. If you do business with the government over the internet, you enter your social security number and your password (and in some situations also a two-factor code sent to your phone). If you do business with a private party, there is no real harm in showing them your passport. System works perfectly fine for me.

I see now. So I guess to make hiding rewards for proof-solving in the blockchain work, you either need to have a trusted server (as in my example), or you need to know the proofs in advance.
That is, unless you can find a mathematical problem that is somehow reducible to SHA-256-solving, which would be really cool - but likely impossible.
Would it be possible to create an altcoin with a type of proof of work to which multiple useful mathematical problems could be reduced?
@_date: 2014-05-08 18:24:59
For verification of your own votes, you don't need to use the blockchain either. You can just let the government publish a list of all (signed) votes. Note that you don't need to trust the government in order to be able to verify your own vote.
Where the blockchain might help though, is in proving to others whether your vote has been counted correctly. That assumes that a majority of the nodes favours a fair election, but that seems a reasonable assumption.

No, GPL-derived works are not automatically GPL-licensed. If the derived work is not GPL-licensed, the new author commits a copyright-violation. The GPL-license does not get applied automatically.

That only works if you are willing to allow voters to prove to others what they voted. If voters can prove what they voted, they can also sell their votes.
I'm not sure how pushing your signed vote to the blockchain would differ from pushing your signed vote to a government server in terms of ease of counting?
I'm also not sure how a compulsory blockchain wallet and a compulsary government ID differ?

In the US, you can (in some cases) make debit card transactions without the bank's approval (e.g. if you have no credit), thus giving you the possibility to overdraw your account without permission.

It's not fully clear to me how this works from a technical perspective. Do I understand it correctly that you don't know the proofs to the theorems before encoding them in the block chain (or at least you don't need to know them for the system to work)? How is the link made between private key and proof? I assume that the Mathgate server acts as a trusted party, i.e. it replies with the private key when it receives a proof that it can verify?

Note that computer science differs a bit from other scientific fields, in that most research is typically published in conferences rather than journals.

Offer saving accounts denominated in bitcoin.
How many of you would be interested in giving your bitcoins to a bank if the bank promises you to give them back in a year with, say, 2% interest? I think it would still be a good deal for the customer (the 2% offsets the risk of bank bankrupcy), and the bank could loan the coins to someone who wishes to short them (or use them for investment), at minimal risk for a cheap price.
Technically you don't need a bank for such a loan/scheme, but so far, I never hear of anyone investing their bitcoin savings (loaning them out), rather then simply hoarding them.
@_date: 2014-05-08 18:12:26
But you don't need the block chain for that, traditional public-private key cryptography (as is around since the 1970's) would do just that.
People also would still need to go to the voting booth, unless you find it acceptable that voters might opt to show others what they voted (and therefore have the possibility to sell their votes).

~~Their spread (difference between buy and sell rate) seems to be 1%, correct? Never ignore the spread, it's usually much more important than the fixed costs.~~
~~Do you think a spread of less than 1% is achievable through a EUR-BTC-GBP conversion?~~
For comparison:
* A regular EUR-GBP bank transfer of 1000 euro costs me 6,00 euro on the sending side and 7,00 pound on the receiving side, with a spread of 1% as well.
* My debit card payments have a spread of 2%.
* My credit card payments have a spread of 2.7%, no costs.
* travelex.it seems to have a spread of about 16%, no costs.
Conclusion: whatever you do, don't use travelex.
EDIT: I was wrong about the spread, what I thought was the spread are the fixed fees already priced in.

If the stats are about bit1, I don't see why it should be called SegWit2x-signalling: SegWit2x does not require signalling bit1 yet (only after the lock-in). It can be expected that at least part of the blocks signalling bit1 do not support SegWit2x (although of course most support both).

No, it does not. The terms 'legal tender' and 'electronic money' have precise meanings, at least in Europe.
Legal tender is, basically, money that cannot be refused when settling debts.
Electronic money is defined in an [EU directive]( My guess is that bitcoins are excluded because electronic money is defined in this EU directive as representation of a claim on an issuer, while bitcoin has no issuer.
There are not laws against people using money other than legal tender or electronic money if they choose to do so, be it foreign currency, cattle, or bitcoin.
