It's trivial to destroy. Probably 20% of all existing bitcoins are unrecoverable due to lost keys. This is nothing like gold being stolen, which merely changes its owner. It's more like firing gold into the sun.

This is actually good news!

Oh - I visit you so rarely, but you never disappoint.

What possible reason does a BTC company have for doing this? Pulling the canary would just destroy their company, with no benefit to them.
It seems like a strange idea to trust a company to volunteer to cause their own, completely optional bankruptcy.

At the same time we were using pounds and ounces, gallons and pints, yards, feet and inches.
Good thing we got our shit together.

I'm not sure why you're plotting inflation projections, which appear to just be the derivative of the monetary base. Inflation just *doesn't* have that direct a tie to monetary base, which your last plot makes blindingly obvious.

Announcing that you personally have $250k in effectively cash with you is not normal behaviour.
If you want to be your own bank, you should really hire as much security as your bank does.

Well, it seems like at least one person just learned it today.

You're comparing the entire world's financial system to a system that gives up above about 500 transactions a minute? VISA alone handles 200x that and wouldn't even break a sweat increasing that tenfold.

About the same as 280million mean people.

You have apparently no idea what the word crime means. The distinction you are clumslily staggering around is 'malum in se' vs 'malum prohibitum'.

You are, of course, welcome to spend your funds however you wish. But I think it is profoundly misleading to post a thread describing your small farm as profitable when you've sunk thousands and are still losing hundreds per month at current prices. And that the only route to profitability is stopping being small scale, or a huge price rise.
It's something of an absurdity to premise an expected return based on a large price rise, for two reasons. The first is that the easiest way to profit from a future rise is just *buying Bitcoin*. The second is that the hash rate affects the problem difficulty. If prices go up, more mothballed miners will be turned back on and stabilise the return on sunk electricity. And that's just mothballed miners from the last boom - if a high price environment there would also be newer, more efficient machines that are viable at a much lower hash/joule value.
I wish you the best of luck, but I feel that one must question your wisdom.
I leave you with a simple observation: at your current rates, if you cannot immediately invest the extra capital to push your number of devices over the cost of your rent, the best thing for you to do is find some way of breaking your lease early and just leave those miners boxed up in your garage where you are, at least, not losing money to the landlord every month.

You say every 2016 blocks. The comment says every two weeks. With 10 minute blocks, that's the same, but in the former case if you lose 85% of your hash power you're going to be dealing with blocks taking over an hour for potentially months

So... $70 revenue total per miner with $45 cost in electricity, so $25 per miner profit before capital, rent and infrastructure costs.
If you include rent, you have 9 miners ($225/month) in a building that costs you $450/month? Oh my.
It sounds like you need another 11 of the same miners (what, $4k?) just to stop haemorrhaging money month on month. If you get 30 total you'd be in the hole for maybe $12k and making $250/month, allowing you to break even in... 4 years.
I'm not sure it was really fair of you to describe this as being profitable.

I can't tell you what those numbers will be, but I'm willing to bet there's a factor five difference between the highest one and the lowest one.
@_date: 2019-01-19 04:01:41
Can you be a bit more specific about details? I can see you've got $350 monthly income in the screenshot, but is that total? Or for some fraction of your gear? How much electricity does that correspond to? What was the upfront cost, and how long do you consider reasonable to recoup that? What's the property rent and would you be paying it without mining?

There's not "no handle", there's just no good handle. You could, for example, engage in massive borrowing or expropriation to provide funds for stimulus.

BTC can't be both stable valued and a significant world currency. As of right now, the maximum possible number of BTC in circulation is worth about ~$1.5b, and more than half the BTC than can ever exist, do. I'd also guess that a sizeable percentage of these BTC are unrecoverable, but I don't know what magnitude that would be. Let's just call the max BTC supply without deflation around $3b present dollars. That is *nothing* compared to the value you'd need for it to be an actual trade currency. You can't really influence the velocity of money too much, so to increase the volume of trade occurring in a fixed-supply currency, the value has to go up essentially proportional to the increase in the volume of trade. However, this makes it a more attractive investment and less attractive as a currency, reducing the velocity and thus requiring still greater increases in real-world value to allow high trade volumes.
Bitcoin either has to go up hugely, or fail to make any kind of an impact and be replaced. I'm guessing the former followed by the latter.

One problem with deflationary currency and with demurrage is essentially the same: loss aversion. With demurrage, your balance going down is psychologically worse than inflation increasing but your wallet staying the same. With deflationary currency, you have nominal downwards rigidity: people don't like the face-value of their income going down, no matter what is happening to their buying power.
