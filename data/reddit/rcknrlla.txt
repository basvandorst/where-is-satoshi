yes, because you know the majority of bitcoin buyers personally...i am honoured to be conversing with you.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:21:26
exactly, btfd

the guy making the prediction does not know what he is talking about...how in the flying f***  can you make prediction with such a range. trying to cover 75 % of your bases because you following the hit and hope shotgun approach
.....cnbc?? really?
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:15:07
swiss futures have been out for ages....
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:19:34
correct, thankfully...its establishing itself as a store of value, more akin to gold but in the digital form.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:29:14
what does self certification mean, is it guaranteed to go ahead?
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:05:09
very unethical but your guess is as good as mine
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:04:05
sign of things to come...be undercover if you have the choice.
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:52:48
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:23:10
hold it if you can....just the beginning. i got in earlier and have been through a few of these....goes up alot, goes down half, goes down alot....repeats
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:05:32
no idea
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:23:22
keep calm and crypto......this too shall pas
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:29:35
it started as an attack....this is just a correction
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:48:16
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:04:42
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:01:10
i think it means they expect a very large amount of people to sell so they want to ensure they have enough buyers so price does not crash...sort of like a handicapping in horse racing.
Even if this was not a controversial crypto, after the last 24 hour rise, most will sell to seal in profit.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:47:15
coinbase is only trading bch/usd....not the other pairs. this protectionism is artificial
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:54:15
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:31:48
was this really in the Washington Post? scrapping the barrel much?
@_date: 2017-12-26 08:23:52
really silly article. like saying 'I will never afford a whole car, I rather buy 2000 tricyles' yes, that will work
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:08:16
amazing PR machine these guys have...almost like the altcoin bcash has nothing to offer in reality. this is just a pump
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:58:00
they are trying to artificially prop up bcash
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:29:50
treats btc as a pure trade-able instrument...ignores everything else and still gets it wrong
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:27:06
coinbase is acting in an abhorrent manner re propping up some alts imo, but this is normal
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:35:18
very unlikely....governments are making it legal (currency or commodity) and regulating it.
why would they want to lose out on tax revenue and be left behind re innovation. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:34:35
thats in an hour and half right?
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:07:10
they have not enabled the btc/bch market.
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:01:56
poor article from so called expert...amateurish.. not even proof read
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:22:19
i have not kept any of this...
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:00:35
obviously not for someone as skilled in armchair analysis as yourself. have a cigarette, rub one out...but for god sakes man...just chill and try to think critically don't just panic
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:52:15
they're trying to make altcash anti fragile with the help of the exchange that has pegged the price and opens and closes the markets...
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:29:00
The total value of all gold ever mined would exceed US$7.5 trillion --(Wikipedia).
Bitcoin is 200 Billion marketcap
Thats not 60%
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:12:49
If the shoeshine boy was giving you tips on Gold, would you have sold? .....bitcoin is not a stock
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:01:30
its a coordinated attempt by an altcoin to sow FUD into the Bitcoin community and especially recent buyers.
they adopted a now or never approach in association with a few other bad actors.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:15:26
bcash and coinbase started it.....
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:30:38
expected to cross the tree fiddy.
technical analysis made.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:20:51
you obviously dont read alot
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:38:45
need to sell asap though....otherwise will lose alot
@_date: 2018-08-04 16:06:35
Worst advice ever
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:13:48
agree, always bought in on the dips when bitcoin was dying...lol.....haven't gone wrong.
all this fud re bitcoin is crashing and sell sell sell is nonsense.
DYOR .
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:58:58
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:15:18
why wont they insist on replay protection
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:08:27
This 2X attack should be answered unequivocally. It does not have replay protection and is not in the interests of Bitcoin.
As a 'user' I plan on dumping 2x as soon as I can and acquire Bitcoin so that value is transferred back to Bitcoin as quickly as possible.
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:52:51
lots of otherwise smart people will be late to the game and prob only invest when volatility reduces.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:17:19
overtake? feeling? spikes?
yes, definately....bitcoin is dead for the 500th time
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:04:38
very much so. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:08:56
well done to these guys for listening to the Bitcoin Community. This testament to the maturity of Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:19:20
and the altcoin bch is so attractive
@_date: 2017-09-22 17:59:42
bankers seem nervous...just my opinion
@_date: 2017-10-09 11:51:35
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:30:28
is this guy used to pulling out stats out his ass...
@_date: 2017-09-19 14:05:47
so another banker does not support Bitcoin.....do we really care?
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:07:52
quite funny
@_date: 2017-10-09 17:28:48
pretty sure they're not like me, but quite possible that you are as smart as them...
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:43:12
this is the type of news that you want to start to see more off...
