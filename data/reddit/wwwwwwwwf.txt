Health insurance btfo your lovely andecote nowadays. Dont want insurance you gotta pay anyway and be prepared to bankrupt your credit if you have health issues or let your burden be others expense. Factories were the economy now finding ill people to treat is. Why should a nurse who brings 10 patients a night ice water make 75k? Because the scammers up the ladder make gobs more. Personally I would like to see an economy where we make something good instead of gouging the sick and suffering but like your pleasant story those days are gone.

This is quite the delusion youve fed yourself. Minimum is about 600/week wage the majority will never see this with no education or nepotism from dads friend. Dont get me wrong im all about living within means but there are no means comparable to those unioned factories used to offer for slumdog avg joe and jane.

This is backward / doesnt apply. The point is the fed us literally paying interest to banks to hold cash reserves which is redundant cause supposedly the fed has stricter regulating since 2008. So which is it fed? You hold and pay on reserves or you use stricter regulation but BOTH? We're in for it.

What you do doesnt define your class its how much you earn. 40k/year where in akron are those jobs.
