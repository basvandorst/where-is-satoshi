Yea I don't know if I believe this a whole lot with $Dash as a prime example yesterday. Thanks though. Appreciate the input.

Never! Have not sold anything. Hodl but wish I sold in the uptrend.

I was chasing that hyper boom. Guess I should've followed the law. What goes that straight up will come the fuck back down.

Never. I'm truly in love with Bitcoin. And the blockchain. It's  to me. I just want to see good things. Wish I saw this second dip though so I could've sold out and bought more while it's low. I want more and more. Hodl for life. My kids will reap my choices in Bitcoin.

Trying to. My nerves are more volatile than Bitcoin right now. Lmao. Just wish I sold during the uptrend.

How much of a downtrend are we potentially seeing anyways. Any analyst suggestions? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:37:55
Agreed. I'm looking for telegram chats or something along those lines of communities talking about trends and anylists to follow.

Is it though, is it?

Seems like everyone might be waking up Bitcoin is going up.

Hord it and wait 10-20 more years when Bitcoin seriously takes off. Your worth nothing compared to what you will be worth in the upcoming years.

They need to bring these to Florida!

Sure. Sell a little bit keep a eye on the current drop. Sell after it booms again. Only then will it be worth selling. Play the market right and buy low, sell high your gains will be endless when the bitcoin market surges.
