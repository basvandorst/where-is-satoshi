Police alleged that he controlled fake account to be padded many bitcoins, convert customers bitcoins to him private wallet, and provide fake order book. So they are going to build a prosecutable case by "私電磁的記録不正作出・同供用" / "use of illegally produced private electromagnetic record".

IMO, this is one of the best scenario to touch for critical masses. On Twitch.tv, gamers get earn money from viewers through PayPal, or advertising. But PayPal fee is not cheep. Cryptocurrency can give full of viewers money to gamers.

And Japanese think bitcoin so, too.

I created the debate and events timeline.
In my thought, HK agreement is living and miners do that.
