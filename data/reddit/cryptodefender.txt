I disagree with everything you said except for one thing - you're correct that the price of Bitcoin *will* go up if JPMorgan Chase starts buying a ton of it. Fingers crossed that they do.

I don't know how you can dispute the fact that every dollar invested in Bitcoin means a dollar less in a bank.

It's important to remember that every Bitcoin in existence is currently owned by someone. There are no unowned Bitcoins. In order for Chase or anyone else to buy a Bitcoin, the other party would have to agree to sell it.
If Chase were to buy a ridiculous amount of Bitcoin regardless of the price, the price would inevitably shoot up because the demand would exceed the supply. People who are hodling would see the value of their portfolio go through the roof and they'd continue to hodl (i.e. Chase would not get hodlers coins unless hodlers didn't hodl). People who have been thinking about buying would FOMO in droves.
If Chase were to inflate the market like this, then the market cap would skyrocket and more individuals would pile in.  If they just held on to their Bitcoin, the prices would stay high, but the divisibility wouldn't stop anyone from entering the market. 
Chase could always then sell a bunch of Bitcoin at a loss just to try to crush it. They'd drive prices down, but in reality, they'd probably never go as low as they were when they first bought in. Why? Because of the hodlers. They're still hodling long-term and they will keep the value up.
Market manipulation is real (and is probably already occurring), but most of us hodlers have great faith in this technology and see the manipulation for what it is.

He addresses this in the FAQ on his Patreon page:

I ask them to tell me what exactly is backing the U.S. dollar. They usually stop to think for a moment and then acknowledge that they don't know. Sometimes they say "gold" which makes them easy pickins for my followups.

Andreas Antonopoulos had a happy hour last night in Chicago for his Patreon supporters! (That’s me and him in the photo.) It was supposed to last 2 hours but he stayed for nearly 5! Awesome dude.
He’s doing amazing things for Bitcoin in the world. If you’re a fan of his, I highly recommend supporting him on Patreon so that he can keep traveling the world to evangelize Bitcoin!

How much was it worth when it died?

He has a lot less BTC than most think! The Patreon support is very meaningful to him and is what allows him to continue doing the work he’s doing.
