Usually I find that people get frustrated in a sub like this when someone asks a question that could be solved with the first result in a Google search.  If it's a bit more complicated or specific, people are generally willing to help out.  You'll still have your miserable jerks here and there that pipe up with snarky ass-hattery, but that's life.  
Circlejerking exists in every subreddit, unfortunately.

There are other forms of wallets as well (Local, paper, cold strage, etc.)  But Blockchain is fairly safe.  I'd recommend enabling 2 factor authentication (a password and SMS) for now - should serve just fine.  If you're extra paranoid, you can look into those other methods and store them that way later.

Bitcoin is divisible (major plus for a means of exchange).  I can't give you part of a chicken or donkey for an orange, but I can give you 0.5967 mBTC for said orange. Currency was developed to work better than barter, Bitcoin was developed to work better than centralized currencies.

I think the original bubble(s) were due to very early adopters cashing out to make some bank.  The sentiment these days seems to be to hold on for the ride.  With big players entering the market, they may be a little more reluctant to sell of the coins they bought.  The 'crashes' may seem a bit more softer from here on out.
@_date: 2013-11-14 06:19:29
I'm not exactly sure how accurate the numbers are.  A lot of the BTC could be sitting in exchanges (outside of an address) or things like that.  But really 99.9% of people aren't doing anything with Bitcoin yet.

Yes, in a long-winded, unnecessary way.  You're implying because you didn't understand the difference, nobody would.  Then felt the desire to justify your ignorance by stating that because *you* didnt understand it, that clearly the majority of us wouldn't either - like you're on some higher level of understanding than most.
There isn't any other way could have worded it more accurately, short of 'not to be confused with...'
I apologize for being so short, but I completely understood what he was referring to, and when you basically stated that, 'These plebs wouldn't understand the difference, because *I* didn't', it struck a chord with me.

The open-source nature and the adaptability of Bitcoin is what makes it differ than a startup company with self interest in mind.  Bitcoin has the initial advantage at this point, and altcoins that have a 'better' functionality than bitcoin can be incorporated into the blockchain of Bitcoin itself, if necessary.
Could it be replaced by an altcoin?  Absolutely.  Could it co-exist with an altcoin akin to gold/silver etc.?  Also a possibility.  Could we just never utilize digital currencies altogether?  I'm leaning toward not likely.
Referring to it as 'just code' is a simplification.  Twitter is just code.  Anyone with a bit of startup capital can make another Twitter, and possibly (but very unlikely) people would use the new Twitter over the old one, (MySpace/Facebook anyone?).  But this is also a very general simplification.
Bitcoin differs in a way that it's challenging an entire means of how we interact (financially) like TCP/IP did for communication.  Someone could have made another set of protocols similar to TCP/IP months or years after the initial one, but why?  We could also easily have services built *upon* the Bitcoin foundation (eg. websites and services on the internet built on top of fundamentals).
I'm by no means a 'Sell all assets, buy all Bitcoins, TO THE MOON!', person.  But I firmly believe a system like Bitcoin that is ubiquitous has **vast** potential, which can be utilized now as well have huge implications for tech and services down the line.

Rpietila's post on bitcointalk doesn't seem to consider that only a fraction of btc will be used.  Not including lost coins over time, people holding/saving, etc.  Take that $100k/btc possibility and compare it to something like 10% of coins ever mined are being used, and now we do have valuation at $1,000k/btc.
You've probably seen this calculator tool, but this can give you a rough estimation on what the value could reach;
Even at just 6% of the worlds economy using btc at 20% mined being used for transactions, you get $1,100k/btc.
Of course this is wild speculation, but definitely not out of the realm of possibility.

People are always wanting a crash to buy, the whole 'buy low, sell high' thing.  That's not necessarily what it means.  You buy when something is undervalued (low), sell when it's overvalued (high).  It's not relative.
I'm of the opinion that Bitcoin is still *extremely* undervalued for it's potential.  Buying x amount at a dip that rallies 50% is the same as buying when flat/climbing and it continues up a bull run 50%.  The only thing about the second scenario is that if you were waiting on the sidelines for a dip, you'll only be getting half the Bitcoin for your dollar, or none because you'll just be waiting for your crash.
Bitcoin is gunning to replace (or supplement) how we deal with global financial transactions.  The implications here are absolutely huge.  Winklevii project a 400x mid-term market cap.  However much stock you put in their opinion, but even at a $400 billion market cap ($40k/coin), there's still tons of room to grow.

So you have a 'clean' address for BTC, ship x amount to an unregistered address for activities outside of regulation (whatever that may be), gets tumbled/exchanged to an altcoin.  We then start using said altcoin as preference, free of regulation and we go through the whole redundant process again.

The original shutting down barely had an effect on price.  Yes it dipped, but recovered very quickly (media effect).  So take a site that had tons of transactions a day, and a bunch of coins stolen from them - barely an effect on price.  
The new one I'm assuming may take some time to get the same kind of momentum the old one had, so the effect will not even be noticeable.  Stop letting the media control your brain.
The price has been climbing consistently since the old one shut down.  SR has zero to do with the price of btc.

It is disturbing how so many borderline crazies can find and link (confirmation bias) to a website supporting their argument - no matter how absurd - and feel justified because 'they did their research'.  And then the cycle continues.
Although, it works both ways.  Some will use the web to further their understanding.

That being said, this is one of the major points of bitcoin.  Instead of trying to topple the stranglehold the banksters of the world currently have, we're bypassing them altogether with Bitcoin.  If we (as a society) fall for the same crap again, well - shame on us, I guess.

I should have reworded.  Reverse prohibition.  I guess you can call it 'legalizing'.
Of course you'd have you're regular sales tax and/or whatever other taxes come from selling goods.  I mean no *special* tax (akin to tobacco, etc) that benefits the very same people that have been putting people in jail for decades, lobbying, and profiting on a massive scale already from the war on drugs.  
Keep manufacturing, distribution, and sale in the private sector.  Healthy competition unbridled from government fuckery will ensure quality goods to the customer.  Just like in any other business.  Not saying go unregulated, either.  Same regulations in place as for anything else.  But as for complete control over everything from start to finish?  No way.  They fucked up (more than) once, keep them the fuck out of it.

I think China and the "BTC could reach $100k - $1000k" stuff has created quite a stir.
Also the shift from negative to positive reporting on it.  Although, I don't think we'll have the crash we had last spring.  I'm confident we'll hit $300 before the month is out - then who knows.

I think he's implying that if banks started accepting bitcoin as deposits, they can start issuing more bitcoin on the fractional reserve system we have now with fiat.  Essentially creating currency out of nothing but a 10% reserve.  The beauty of it is, that can't be done.  One of the major strengths of bitcoin - finite, cannot be created out of nothing, and verifiable by anyone, anywhere on the network.
If Bitcoin takes off because of these reasons, and the bank tried to create their own form of Bitcoin that acts the same as the current fiat system, people will just continue to use Bitcoin.  
95% of issued currency is digital now anyway, so the only thing they'd really be doing different is trying to steal the good faith that the Bitcoin name has (or will) made for itself.

@_date: 2013-11-20 09:33:59
Posted this before, but applies here too;  
Mining has never really been viewed as 'profitable'. In the CPU days you could mine your own blocks reliably, but you couldn't exchange your coins for jack. Then GPU days, you're buying a ~$400 card for a few Bitcoins a day (at the time) and able to exchange them for a couple bucks.
I was building mining rigs for the better part of a year, then got an early wave of ASICs from BFL (I know, but I paid fiat and got them in the first wave - one of the lucky ones).
When I started, and up until the ASIC generation, mining always been regarded as a 'waste of time'. *Just buy coins* - is the general opinion. Which is accurate. If I just bought coins instead of cards and ASICs, I'd probably have more coins today than I do now.
I find it fun and interesting being at the base level of how Bitcoin operates though. Helping secure the network is also a plus.

On bitcointalk.org yesterday;
"ok i think the OP wanted something like this:
The year is 2023, bitcoin price fluctuations are a thing of the past.  Sure the price will move up or down vs. the USD by a few hundred dollars each day, but with 1 btc being normalized to over $50k USD, the price fluctuations are fractions of a %.
Satoshi's 1.8M coins are now worth around $90B making him, her, or it, the richest entity in the world.  Much speculation about Satoshi's large, personal, trackable crypto-wealth swirled for over a decade, as the coins mined by Satoshi have never moved.  Some speculated that the private keys were destroyed and those 1.8M coins should be thought of as "out of circulation," increasing scarcity.
But the world would never have guessed the return would be so epic.  All of the sudden, the coins began to move.  First a few million to a new bitcoin address.  The transaction contained a message "I have returned to help" and it was signed by Satoshi's original PGP key.  Holy shit he was back.  Efforts to trace the origin &amp; recipient of the transaction remain a mystery.
The following day Bloomberg's Bitcoin channel reported that it had observed a $100M transaction from 0-taint coins.  Hours later the Japanese government announced that an anonymous payment was made to the One Drop Foundation, an organization bringing water to 3rd world countries.  That transaction was signed with the message "From a single drop of water comes civilization"
The next few months were a whirlwind of activity from the stash of coins.  $500M to feed the entire nation of North Korea during a recent drought - signed with "We are all brothers who need to eat."  Countless other social expenditures followed.  Over $10B distributed in less than a month.  Wikipedia, who had survived the past decade on mostly bitcoin donations, received the last one it would ever need.  The $5B Wikimedia trust foundation was founded and chaired by quantum computer programmed with every financial transaction Warren Buffet ever made in his lifetime.  RIP Buffet March 17th 2017, transforming St. Patricks day into a celebration of alcohol and fiscal responsibility.
Then came the $3.6B acquisition of the once powerful Facebook/instagram/twitter company.  That transaction was signed "With this platform the revolution begins" And the once powerful, but now Myspace-esque social media platforms were to become the hub of "the Anonymous Party" with chapters in 50+ countries.  This announcement was followed by a 1M coin transaction - the largest the network had ever seen - placed into a cryptographically secured multi-factor wallet controlled by 7 humans.  Richard Dawkins leads the group.  The message attached to this transaction was simple yet powerful:  "Hack Politics."  
The whitepaper that followed explained it all.  It was a geopolitical blueprint illustrating each countries injustices and how best to seize political power bloodlessly.  Once installed there were instruction to set up "BitVote," an extremely secure and unhackable voting program that all citizens could use from their homes.  It was real-time, issues would change as the minds of the governed changed.  It incorporated a unique iris-distance anonymous login system that ensured unique votes and no personal information tracked.  The governments of Australia and Germany installed the software immediately - and I don't mean there needed to be any central software - merely the laws were quickly passed to use the public, decentralized BitVote ledger as the public poll.  The BitVote BlockChain recorded every politician's every vote, easily searchable on BitVoteChain.info.
Politics in almost every country changed within a few years.  Full transparency was the world-norm.  2025 saw Jullian Assange allowed to leave the Ecuadorian embassy, also achieving a Guinness award for longest continuous stay in a 400sq ft apartment.  The President of Pakistan, 27 year old Malala Yousafzai cheered the end of tyranny as she was inaugurated.
Satoshi had changed the world.  The world tried to give thanks, but it would never know which entity to thank.  The man [the top 2020's era Satoshists believe it to be only one man and not a female] that would forever be known as Satoshi makes only one last transaction, a single satoshi sent to his first bitcoin address

Ideally, you'd do the whole cycle of business in BTC only (including paying employees), never having to deal with fiat at all.  This would speed up the business process immensely, and the fees would be extremely reduced.

Comparing it to a stock, VC's see these swings all the time.  The reason it seems strange is because people only see stocks after an IPO, when a *lot* of the gains have already been made and the volatility has slowed down considerably.
The employees who started at Google in the early days got a big chunk of stocks, and by the time the IPO hit, they were made millionaires (or multimillionaires in some cases).  All from a company that just let you put words in a box and find web pages.  
*"How does Google compare to say, a construction company, that builds things that you can see and attach value to"*, They may have said back then.
Bitcoin puts anyone that holds BTC in the Venture Capitalist seat.  Could it become worth nothing?  Possibly.  But the risk/reward is that right on par with VC's (early adopters) or early Google employees getting share packages (people currently buying bitcoin).

Exactly.  People keep saying this without realizing miners are the absolute backbone of this whole thing.  If we want to talk about 'bubbles', this could be a huge hash power bubble.  As more and more people stop mining, the equilibrium will start to balance out and some may start to kick miners on again (or order them enmasse) creating another hash spike.
I started mining just before GPU mining took off, and was lucky to get a Jalapeno from BFL in the first wave (mid June this year).  It's paid for itself (first pre-orders were like, $199 or something) and then some.  Currently, the difficulty seems to make it 'not worth it' (getting in the ballpark of 0.02btc/day) but I'm going to get every single Satoshi I can possibly get out of this thing.

You don't think people would drop the redundant 0's when writing it out?  Say on a cheque (or similar)?  Simplicity is key.
I think, psychologically speaking, the majority of people would rather see 44.55 mBTC in their wallet rather than 0.04455000 BTC (or 0.044'550'00).
Similarly how one would have $451.22 in their bank account rather than $0,000,451.22

1 mBTC is roughly $0.43.  Cheap!
Just hit me, I remember a time not long ago discussing (and getting really excited) about 1 BTC hitting parity with the dollar, now we're almost at 1 mBTC getting there.  How long until 1 uBTC is at parity?

I think perhaps once you can be paid and pay for the majority of things day-to-day with BTC will be a huge milestone in the adoption of BTC as a currency over just speculation.  
The utility is immensely more efficient than the current setup with fiat, but there are some major hurdles to overcome if we want to get there.  The psychology of treating it as an investment over currency seems to me like one of those hurdles.

One could argue that Bitcoin is explosively in demand due to the deterioration of the financial sector, at the root being the fractional reserve banking system.  The fact that the current economic system is so engrained on a global scale we don't even think about the possibility of it being replaced.  That *could* be a driving factor, which is what gives Bitcoin the 'all or bust' mentality.
It's easy to see now how Google has a utility, hindsight really is 20/20.  Smartphones weren't even on the menu when Google started and when venture capital was coming in.  At that time, it was just another search engine.  Just another chunk of code like Webcrawler or Yahoo.  Not really that revolutionary - anyone could do it.
I'm not saying Bitcoin is going to definitely replace Visa, Gold, or the global economic system.  But it very much does have a utility in a world where microtransactions are going to become very much in demand, along with a population concerned about where and how people should store/transfer wealth securely and easily.

Depends on where you live.  The sidebar contains a lot of info that you may be looking for.  You should do much more research though if you're going to get into mining.

How long do you think Bitcoin would last if you went to use it to purchase something and they said, "Oops, sorry, these coins are tainted 17 transactions ago.  Can't take 'em."
How many merchants would refuse to take them as payment if they tried to pass some coins off to pay taxes and the government refused to take them because of taint?
How long before the value of Bitcoin crashed hard to zero because of these reasons?
Fungibility is effectively destroyed once they're allowed to control which coins are 'good' and which ones aren't.

At current prices, yes.  Gpu mining at $5 / coin wasn't insanely profitable at the time.   Mine 100 coins to break even at the time didn't seem worth it.  But if you still had those 100 coins now, you got your $500 back and then some.  If he mines even 50 coins with that thing, and the price shoots up to $1000 / coin, I'd say that's profitable.
Edit:  I guess it's pointless to edit at this point, but I was replying how mining can still be profitable, not what's better - buying rigs or buying coins.  And more disagreement about *needing* miners?  They're the backbone of how this whole thing works.  This fuckin' place sometimes...

Honestly, I think it's stuff like this that turns new players *away* from btc.  A nice, simple, ubiquitous wallet that trumps online banking/credit card security is what Bitcoin needs. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:12:29
Yea, but when that happens, they usually go overboard and print too much, making everyone elses cash less valuable (inflation).  BTC out of circulation makes everyone elses BTC *slightly more* valuable (deflation).  It's actually one (of many) of the great things about Bitcoin.

If Bitcoin *does* become a legitimate global money source, then they are still *extremely* undervalued.

I guess we'll have to agree to agree.
I wasn't referring to the drop in price (or 'crash', as it were) but the misconception of the 'buy low, sell high' cliche.  Which, as you've said, is impossible to determine with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-20 09:51:13
The average miner with an average card wasn't getting close to a Gh/s usually at anytime (esp 2010/11) in the GPU days. 
At the end of GPU mining, with an average card, you were looking at less than a coin a day.
And Btc/$5 or so.  Not 'worth' buying a high end card(s).

I gotcha, not *literally* redundant, but they would *feel* redundant if Bitcoin were to be adopted mainstream and value increased significantly.  Similar to gold, as price goes up, the value of exchange is referred to in smaller weights.
I agree SI decimals make it look much cleaner than 1043.86013322 BTC.  But if we start dealing with mBTC (or even μBTC) on a day to day basis, we'll simplify.
*Cashiers wanted: 25.50 μBTC/hour*  
*Cashiers wanted: 0.000'025'50 BTC/hour*  
*Plums 45 μBTC / lb.*  
*Plums 0.000'000'45 BTC / lb.*
*Gas: 40 BTC/ gal.*
.... ok, bad example.
You get the idea, but I totally understand what you're getting at as well.

Posted this yesterday, but applies here too (because it gets asked all the time);
Mining has never really been viewed as 'profitable'. In the CPU days you couldn't exchange your coins for jack. Then GPU days, you're buying a ~$400 card for a few Bitcoins a day (at the time) and able to exchange them for a couple bucks.
I was building mining rigs for the better part of a year, then got an early wave of ASICs from BFL (I know, but I paid fiat and got them in the first wave - one of the lucky ones).
When I started, and up until the ASIC generation, mining always been regarded as a 'waste of time'. *Just buy coins* - is the general opinion. Which is accurate. If I just bought coins instead of cards and ASICs, I'd probably have more coins today than I do now.
I find it fun and interesting being at the base level of how Bitcoin operates though. Helping secure the network is also a plus.

Just a long winded 'no intrinsic value' proponent.  He seems to like comparing it to commodities quite a bit, but barely touches on how it compares to other currencies.
Spoiler alert:  All currencies are backed by absolutely nothing but a sophisticated shadow game that benefits a very small fraction of the global population.  
Bitcoin attempts to bypass this by not allowing constant wealth transfer to the upper echelon.
