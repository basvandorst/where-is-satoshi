I do not know about personal accounts since we were trying to get corp account open and they did not have any restriction for this. So, your company can basically be registered in EU, US or anywhere to get your account open with them. But we had no luck at all with them.

Edge	iOS - Not avaialble yet. Only beta sign up.
GreenAddress iOS - Tried to create new wallet multiple times, no luck. Freezing all the time.
BitWallet iOS - Not available in my region (RU)
So, basically, had to install desktop wallet to support this movement. Also had to modify all mining settings including creating new accounts at pools because my payouts were locked to non-segwit address. So, it was not like a 5 minutes task but I believe its absolutely critical now and will save a lot of time in the future.

Bitcoin forgives everything. Even when you cheat with altcoins. I would sell alts for btc and hold. Soon you will have much more in fiat holding btc than before.
Do not trade if you are not professional. If you believe in some altcoins you can buy some and hold.

I highly doubt it's the same person because he does not need to ask for donation here having a multi-million visitors blog. He already collected like $300k in a week via his blog. So do not be delusional that somebody can post here to collect some money. In the same time it's highly related to bitcoin being a payment option nobody can stop. But we can now anticipate this -&gt; RUSSIA BANNED BITCOIN :)

So, seems that localbitcions considers $300 a spare change. And if somebody loses it, he is just a looser. No need to bother other people which can have positive experience with that trader.

Reading this and having any coins on coinbase would made me move out instantly.

nice one, lol))
thank you for the ideas guys, but how about fake cash?
@_date: 2016-12-19 21:01:04
That was not a credit card payment. It was a transfer from one card to another. Amex serve to serve.
Look, man, the problem is that this guys is still active, he has managed to stay active on localbitcions and continue scam people. I understand that they cannot protect people 100% but they can ban scammers right away.

I would not consider it safe to meet anybody in person to sell bitcoins.

I would skip posting anything from zerohedge as they used to cause panic on btc market with their fake news, like china was going to ban bitcoin according to their "insiders"

BU miners do not let softfork happen. They are blocking it.

will you install alpha version of new windows if presented? How long they gonna test? For, like 1 month?


I realize that this 0.01% can have enough bugs to trash bitcoin as  we know who is programming it.

Segwit2x is not ready. Never tested. It's simply trusting 40bn market to the software which was baked overnight. That's crazy. Moreover segwit2x will put core devs outside which might be a disaster.
