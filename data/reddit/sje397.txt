Plus there was no lightning network last spike.

Hopefully with his wallet keys.

I don't know who it is and out of gratitude I'd rather respect their desire for privacy. But back in 2011 when I first got involved I believed they might have hidden from governments more than I do today. It took a while to see the lack of foresight governments have with respect to Bitcoin.

It won't reduce supply. The difficulty will come down.

I've been watching the graphs for years. I wouldn't have a clue if now is a good time to buy. I'd like to think this is just the start of a big bubble, but who knows.
@_date: 2019-06-20 12:49:09
Oh wow. I laughed a lot.
@_date: 2019-02-14 23:47:58
True. You'd have to make requests through the 'banker'.

You can make a Google spreadsheet visible to others but only editable by you. And Google.

One Satoshi would be one cent. And lightning transactions can be smaller.

Yeah. That's our mt.gox Bitcoins.

How did you make that video?

All your arguments are historical. Like I said I haven't been following things very closely, so most of that is irrelevant to me and I think most users. Segwit is great just because of the maliability problems it fixes, let alone the efficiency improvements it provides. I never agreed to any compromise, and to call people disgusting for being rational actors is not going to make you any friends.
But thanks for the explanation.

I've mostly stayed out of all this, thinking it would sort itself out. Don't think I'm a victim of groupthink, as I really haven't thought about it much.
The bcash soft fork woke me up a bit, and I've moved my few btc out of exchanges so I'm not beholden to either side.
But from the outside, a damaging hard fork that we clearly do not need since segwit sounds just plain dumb. What legitimate argument is there for that? I've heard none.

Fiat is also bits of censorship resistant paper worth whatever you can trade it for... But  is more easily corrupted and manipulated and has less predictable supply... And can't be teleported.
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:38:30
Not in the way you imply but yes.

I'll give you my house then, in exchange for 10000 worthless Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:54:40
You're putting words in my mouth.
I think the scarcity of Bitcoins might be a factor you need to consider too.
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:02:29
It's new, but you can do things with Bitcoins (a guy bought a Tesla, another guy bought a house.. there are sites that will manage Bitcoin ecommerce for you, etc etc) and the number of things you can do is increasing every day. Also it does not fit the definition of a Ponzi scheme - I think you mean snake oil, which it isn't either.

You'll be able to buy bananas with it. Many places can amortize the risk of double spends and rely en single confirmations, especially for small amounts... Which means a wait if about 10 mins. Or you could have an account with the store. Etc.

Bitcoins exist. They are patterns of numbers, but they have the relevant properties of existence in this case - they can't be forged and they are scarce.

Are people who buy art also suckers? Sometimes they pay a lot more than I would. What about baseball cards? I'm personally not at all interested in baseball. The perceived value by a group of people also affects what you would call real currencies. With Bitcoin you are investing on the basis that others fund it valuable, correct... But Bitcoin has a lot of properties that justify it having some worth - programmability, resistance to manipulation, certain types of security and trustlessness, to name a few.

That's not my idea. But good luck buying Bitcoins for $1.
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:16:49
I would have to look up the market value of linden dollars against some index I understand (dollars or Bitcoins) and then weigh up the hassle of the transactions. There is also the risks associated with trading in a currecncy that is centrally controlled by people I don't know. I'd much prefer payment in Bitcoin - because it has these intrinsically valuable properties.

Nothing is stopping a fork, but that by itself would not add any value.
I for one would definitely not trust a government controlled cryptocurrency - the bailouts were its inspiration. Same with a Facebook or an Amazon coin - if they control it, they can lift the limit and debase it.
