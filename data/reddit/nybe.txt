filled to capacity... and I heard they charge a big fee that may or may not get your tx pushed.

@_date: 2018-09-06 19:55:57
Yes. That's the whole idea, you have to fund a channel in order to use it to make transactions. Your funds are pre-confirmed so payments are "lightning" fast. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 23:04:08
money weak.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:29:08
two of my transactions were sent from a SW wallet and are stuck... presumably because the other end is not SW... but I appreciate you taking the time to explain this stuff.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:23:07
dude come on. go away.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:12:20
also it really doesn't seem to matter... I have sent a transaction with 0.00071307 BTC and it is still just sitting for 13 hours.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:39:18
No because coins like DCR and others are addressing these scaling/fee problems by watching and implementing solutions before hand. Grandpa Bitcoin is becoming the use case test for other coins.

@_date: 2017-12-19 15:53:14
Ok HODLer, what about when you go to purchase your Lambo and you sit there in the showroom waiting for your tranny to clear. Man how embarrassing will that be. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:08:32
don't want the exposure.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:37:30
Yup. I'm that last one to FUD it up... I wholeheartedly believe in this tech. I have FIVE transactions stuck at the moment since last week. All tx's have the proper fees attached. In 6 (SIX) years of using bitcoin I have never ever experienced this kind of swamping. Things need to be dealt with.
EDIT: Hours later; It is now totally obvious that there was a major coordinated attack taking place on the BTC network in the last few days leading up to the Coinbase BCH announcement that intentionally disabled the mempool... Just after the CB/BCH announcement - all 5 of my stuck transactions magically cleared the blockchain...  GDAX/Coinbase have been compromised by Ver &amp; Co. I am hereby terminating my long standing relationship with Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:40:00
will keep an eye on it, thx.

Not really into a reddit back-and-forths and I get your points and respect your background but there is no predicting how bitcoin will behave when and if it does become a stronger form of transaction. 
All I know is, in my experience, my money has depreciated wildly in my 49 years on this earth, whether it was invested, saved, etc. That devaluing action has always driven this unconscious need to spend/invest cash fast otherwise it'll be worth less next year. 
Now I don't know if using, spending, investing bitcoin will really be that much different in the long run, but for right now, it has slowed my desire to spend as fast as I used to. Granted I am an economic layman (read moron) so I don't know if that will cause awful problems or not but I do know that we have become a STUFF based society; everyone (including the poor) wants their consumable items and they WANT IT NOW. Perhaps in a non-linear loop-able economy where there's no need for more crap from China, the bitcoin model will prove to be of great value... 
but hell, I don't know.

Hmm, I'm not really sure but I think I did put my order in quite early in their announcement. 
I popped off an email to them last week inquiring about it and had the Case Wallet by Monday... 
I am thoroughly unimpressed. They need to evolve this wallet through quite a lot before it'll be really usable.

I got one yesterday. my impression: not ready for primetime. 
Based on the (frustrating) way it works I just cannot trust using it as longterm storage OR as a daily spending wallet. With the price of it I'm pretty put off that it is that bad. I've been in contact with them and they don't seem to want to pony up a refund.
With everything else on the market, CW needs a ton more work to be a feasible/competitive product.

In an inflationary currency system, consumers are more motivated to spend as opposed to save for fear that their money will lose value over time.
Whereas in a deflationary monetary system, we are more likely to SAVE as opposed to spend, in anticipation of the money's value going UP.

I'd like to see some kinda metaphor or analogy to an 'awakening' of some sort:
The central control, by an elite 1%, has kept the populace in a zombie like trance state with controlled MEDIA, MONEY, etc. As more and more elements of the society come online and decentralize (i.e. population as living organism) the populace wakes up to its true 'utopian' potential.

I've had many a conversation with a few hyper intelligent skeptics and I've learned this: just because someone is intensely "smart" doesn't mean they totally grasp every concept... in fact, intelligence sometimes creates a prejudice filter.

It's highly unlikely that a 51% attack will kill bitcoin, or that some rogue nation or Dr. Evil would even remotely be able to pull off the huge expenditure and the massive coordination it would take to do so… Even if it does happen, it can't last much longer than 1 or 2 blocks (possibly buying 1 maybe 2 double spends?) without the consensus of users moving away from that forked chain.

Also yes, if you're a high profile persona like AA [(i.e. "on my laptop specifically, because of the target I make in the Bitcoin environment, there's probably a fight going between 3 or 4 national agencies as to who's gonna look at my files first")]( then you better damn well cold storage and whatever other intense overkill securitize your shit.

To make it simple: you ALWAYS sweep paper wallets to a new address because no matter what, you've exposed that set of keys to the dirty ol internet. Also this alleviates the change address problem.
If you want to save out a portion of those back under a watch address, then send them to a new secure/cold paper wallet.

Again I'm sorry, maybe I'm a bit too naive for my own good, but I just don't see it. All that information is written for and stuck in it's time, it doest take into account the fluid nature of open source software development and how quickly fixes, etc. can be implemented into code. Also, maybe there's no direct solution right now but the amount of plate spinning needed in order to completely take over the system is mind boggling.
But then again so what if it did happen… it would create massive learning opportunities to implement into the next phase and create even more powerful decentralized solutions. 
I only see all this as positive. To dwell on the 'what ifs' and all the FUD is unproductive at best.

In my understanding (I could be wrong): a 51% attack would result in a forked chain created off the original blockchain, it would be obvious that it is a rogue fork, and nobody would accept it.

I'm sure your coins are safe as can be on coinbase. 
The only thing I would suggest is keep a small amount in coinbase so it's accessible and store the larger amount in Bitcoin-Qt, on your computer, with a decent password. That's plenty good security. 
There is way too much paranoia in this community of hackers, everyone's always looking over their shoulder at each other with mistrust. 
At some point this all has to be user friendly of its ever going to be a real world usable currency. 
EDIT: don't use windows.

The only reason KnC (and others) looked so good last fall was because of the november bump to $1200.
All those miners they sold right before that bubble were hugely and unexpectedly profitable and when they stopped mining adequately, thereby sold off to hopeful 'new miners,' at above values on craigslists across the country.
KnC, and the mining industry as a whole, were cockily trying to predict that bubble run again, and subsequently made a lot of money from that assumption.

You are still confusing dollars to bitcoins to dollars.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not suggesting tax evasion but my point is: how would they know of any transactions that take place in a strictly btc environ? They wouldn't. They still don't quite get how it functions, so unless they've recently hired some crypto-whizz-kids to do their bidding, bitcoin tx's within its own system are really really really hard to pinpoint to one user/transaction.

in May 2011, I got in at $12-$30. Then there was the crash of June and I lost some interest thinking I'd lost all the money. I promptly forgot about it and at some point, when Bitcoin-Qt became enrcryptable, I locked up my wallet with an impenetrable password. I continued to buy sporadically throughout the summer sending the coins to the locked wallet, occasionally looking at the BTC price throughout 2012 and having a chuckle.
Then at the beginning of 2013 when it all headed for the moon, I sat down and attempted to open my wallet… but of course could not put the pword together for the life of me. I've tried everything and it really sucks. I've even worked with [to no avail.
I most likely would have spent the coins back in april of 2013 so it's all good. I know I wrote it down somewhere in a notebook stored away in this giant messy house. I have complete faith that the notebook and pword will show up one day, so I'm not worried... too much. 
Meantime I have an involuntary (possibly inaccessible) retirement fund sitting and waiting for me.

Lots of parrots in here. 
To my knowledge, breadwallet has never been compromised. You should be fine for now as far as security... as long as you have all security features enabled.. I'd backup the fuck outta your iPhone and I would highly recommend acquiring a Trezor and moving your holdings asap though. 
In terms of the controversy, I'm sitting tight to see how it all plays out. If you haven't exchanged more than you can afford (you haven't right? Right? You haven't invested more than you can afford right?) in the long run you should be fine. 
Keep Calm and Badger on.

Hmmm. Been running a ‘full’ node off and on since late 2012. I’m no expert but my understanding was that if you’re node isn’t open on port 8333 and accepting incoming traffic, it’s not fully validating. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 16:30:36
I'm really in need of something like this. 
Take this idea to the next level by either integrating it into Trezor (such as copay) OR develop your own open sourced hardware that is perhaps a dedicated time lock device.

I asked them the same question and this was their answer:






Compared to coinbase exchange, we're not higher than 75 basis points, and compared to other exchanges/services, we may be cheaper. We're working to bring down the rate by gaining same-day access to non-US or new non-announced US exchanges, and hope to go live with those soon.

Long story long: bought them in 2011 at the "highest" and got discouraged when the price dropped. Was also very paranoid about all the thefts and break-ins going on so when the first bitcoin core wallet came out that was password-able, I promptly made an insanely long and complicated passphrase and locked it all up tight (I wrote it down in a notebook that I'm pretty sure my ex-gf tossed out in 2012). It's now very clear to me that I really didn't need to create such an insane password, something simple would've sufficed since no one knew I had coins anyway.
Kept buying and mining a little bit here and there throughout '11 and sending it to that locked up wallet... but got discouraged because price just kept going down. In 2012 I got distracted by other things, occasionally looking at btc price and chuckling.
2013 btc price goes parabolic. I sit down to open this wallet and could not sort out the passphrase for the life of me. Tried everything. Tore the house apart upside down and sideways looking for the notebook. Even tried  who had no luck.
I still sit down and chisel away at it every few months when the inspiration hits me... I'm hoping one day the password will just come to me.

this I like. Could this also be considered a kind of "share economy?" One of the reasons I quit Facebook in 2012 was the fact that they have intensely commodified (to FB's sole benefit) all their users and the content said users produce. I would like to think we are headed in the direction where ad dollars go directly to users who get the most attention for what they create or share. Perhaps this and something like Ello are the beginnings of a "get paid for your social media contributions" model.

I use circle and coinbase flawlessly but I also keep my exposure very very low with both. 
I occasionally buy Bitcoin from one or the other but those coins are always immediately transferred out to my own private wallet where I hold the keys. I do not consider either of these services as "wallets" per se and would only ever send small amounts of bitcoin to them. 
Not sure why these articles constantly pop up, the fact that you don't hold the private keys on these 'banks' has been gone over adifinitem on the sub.

After watching what happened in 2008 and the following bandaid that was put over the problem and the allowing for the abuses to essentially continue unchecked; It is IMHO **that the world is in for a huge financial spasm** do to our enslavement to government imposed and controlled fiat currency that is not tied to anything of worth.
We ALL have only ever known one way of using 'money' ---&gt; fiat currency (fiat in latin roughly translates to: an arbitrary decree or pronouncement, esp. by a person or group of persons having absolute authority to enforce it... or in other words: currency that is backed by FORCE). There is a slow [Emergent Evolution]( taking place though, and it is changing the way we think about money or currency.
Bitcoin or similar monetary protocols, have begun to change conceptually how a small number of us think about and use money. At some point the [Hundredth Monkey Effect]( will kick in, be it sooner or later, and the rest of the world will catch on to the ease and simplicity of use.

It's time for Gox to recede into the background and make way for the "A" players who actually have wisdom and knowledge with OPM businesses, now coming into the BTC space. 
Gox got lucky by being in the right place/right time. They are run by incompetent decision makers which is a dangerous position for them to be in for the integrity and longevity of Bitcoin.
p.s. I've had both Gox and CBX accounts since 2011 and have been verified on both since they began KYC earlier this year. I NEVER trusted Gox with my business even back then and have always bought and sold through CBX (Via Dwolla) without so much as a hiccup.

This is kind of a silly question, after all time is money. 
The whole point of bitcoin is movement and liquidity. No more middle men holding back your money, low fees, transactions happen today not 3 days from now. 
What's more is I don't always have the optimal amount of fiat in my bank account to buy BTC, so it's nice to know its available when I want it.

Brilliant! 
But cities seem to rely on meters running out to make more money. I'm sure their strategy is to make TONS of money from citations... so the last thing they want is making it convenient for you to zap money to a meter remotely, otherwise they'd have come up with a fiat equivalent. 
Not to mention the point of metered parking is to limit the amount of time people stay parked, This system would have people renting meters for days without moving. I envision someone designing a bot to pay their parking meter while they're off trekking the himalayas for 3 weeks...

it's far beyond any of us to predict the future and the rate at which something like this is adopted widely. Technology has expanded human consciousness to the degree that ideas and concepts can spread like wild fire.
The 'old system' that you speak of - FIAT CURRENCY - has only been in use since 1974 in the USA when Nixon united the dollar from the gold standard. It's days are numbered as no fiat currency has ever lasted.

I'd rather not argue at all... all I'm saying is it's time stop "buying coins" at any level and start earning btc and treating it like a money as opposed to a hot investment commodity, after all you don't buy USD (or other fiat); you earn it. 
Ok fine, a handful of early adopters and lucky people have made a lot of cash being in the right place at the right time (me being one), but it was never intended to be used as an investment vehicle. As long as it is traded as something outside of its usage as a monetary instrument, with the intention of cashing in big, it's going to disappoint.

It would be amazing if scammers and or otherwise "businesses" would do a little research as to the amount of bullshit that gets peddled out into the BTC space before jumping the gun and cranking out a release like this.

Can't agree with you on that. The majority of people that use any kind of currency know only one way to accumulate said currency - they earn it. You're average Joe knows nothing of currency exchanges, they don't use money they earn to buy other money. 
The sooner people get used to using bitcoin as a currency and NOT as an investment commodity, the better. 
Makes for a healthier economy and adds more value. 
P.S. it seems to me that the price of bitcoin has stabilized and is on a very slow rise. Could this not be the result of taking mtgox out of the picture?

Sorry if I gave the impression that I'm hoarding bitcoin; I am most defiantly not. I bought some products yesterday with BTC and paid for Internet services with BTC just last week. 
At this point, with volatility and general mayhem in the "market," I will be holding as opposed to spending but spending as I see fit and as current exchange warrants. By holding BTC, I simply mean you will not see MY bitcoins for sale on any market. Most recently I have had a tiny trickle of BTC income from selling my own goods and services and it's pushing me all the time to figure out how I can EARN more BTC so I can SPEND it like the money that it is intended to be. After all, bitcoins are money not pork bellies. 
My intention from the get go was to replace my dependence on USD with something more robust and bitcoin still has the potential to be a very powerful means to that end.

My only interest in BTC is it's usage as MONEY. I could care less, (although it sucks when it's low) if bitcoins are worth $5 or $50 or $500, it will only gain wide acceptance when we can use it to pay for everything we pay for using USD. Not because of limited supply.
Right now when I mention bitcoin to friends, they think its either an investment vehicle or a ponzi scheme... Not money not currency.

With this kind of behavior it will be a very long time before we can pay the rent or mortgage with a "stable" bitcoin.

I've had it with them. They take too long to deal with problems, they take too long to get back to you and they're smug about it.
I already talked to them about this and they said they reversed the coins because I didn't have funds in my bank. I asked them about the CC backup and they said it's just for verification.
I was fine with that, figured oh well. But now I see charges all over the credit card from CB AND there were more coming WHICH I NEVER MADE that the cc company stopped!!

Fuck coinbase. They are a MASSIVE RIPOFF because you're paying high fees and inflated rates. They have charged my backup credit card and my bank account but yet canceled bitcoins due to "high risk"?!!!?? Bullshit, more likely cancelled because they didn't like the lower price I bought at. At this point I consider it a HIGH RISK to buy from coinbase… They are getting too powerful in this centralized scheme of bitcoin. They are not even an exchange, the only reason everyone started using them is because they were they first that made your bank account available as a deposit source. 
Consider using [CampBX]( or [CoinMKT]( - these are proper exchanges that will be implementing ACH Bank deposits very soon. They let you place orders on the book at the prices you want to pay, not an inflated and heavily fee'd price such as coinbase.

Isn't the whole point of BTC to create a self contained economy with it as the currency? You all keep talking about it as if the point was to get in get out with your fiat all along! It's not its own economy if everyone is more concerned about how they're going to buy and sell BTC in and out with fiat rather than come up with ways to start trading in it exclusively and by EARNING IT. 
All this worry over Dwolla et al. is nonsense and gives the power back to a central authority to control your wealth and value.

wow! they have awesome [feedback]( and looks like they're nice enough to give HUGE discounts on ASIC mining hardware!!! Selling one 50 Gh/s machine for around $500 and a couple other units for only a dollar!!!!! All ya gotta do is just send em some bitcoin! ...such a bargain.

The wallet.dat file created by Bitcoin-Qt is essentially your private key(s). You can password and back that file up to multiple copies offline (thumb drive, etc) and securely delete the copy from your internet connected computer and voila, your BTC is out of reach.

Don't worry, the train will arrive at the station.
Assuming your using Bitcoin-Qt, wait for the blockchain to finish downloading (wallet synching) it can take up to a few hours. Once it has synched, it will have caught up to and verified your transaction which also will have a few confirmations from the network.
I don't use other wallet apps but I assume they all work this way.

I'd have to agree with Red_metal... I am no expert by any means but have a had a happily modest run with asicminer. Now that it looks like the competition is finally getting up to speed, I've been funneling my divs to them (ActM and bASIC) and feel very optimistic at the moment.

If I'm not mistaken, those two strings of text you have on the paper are not passwords but rather your public and private keys for this wallet. 
You may be able to [import those keys into a blockchain wallet]( thereby gaining access to your funds. You should immediately send those funds to a new address, maybe download a wallet app like Bitcoin-Qt and send it there... Good luck.
