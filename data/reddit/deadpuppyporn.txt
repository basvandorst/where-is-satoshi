A million isn't that much money anymore. Not since a long time. If you have a decent job, like an engineer, you will be able to get to a million in a few decades if you invest smart. Almost everyone who owns a decent apartment in New York is a millionaire.

I don't know how its used here in Germany, but I use it as one's net worth. Good to know the US definition is different to mine.

To maybe clear it up:
The runs before the 20k$ run were pretty small, even back when we thought they were big. In 2013 no one outside the geek-world really had anything invested in Bitcoin, no one knew it existed except for those few that were heavily invested in computers (time-wise), like myself. 2013/2014 some normies started knowing about Bitcoin, but only those (of course, exceptions exist) that spent some time in the internet and were in contact with some geeks. Some articles were written, but nothing big.
But then came 2017/2018. Everybody, and I mean everybody knew Bitcoin and almost everyone had something invested in crypto. I was the only one active in the internet scene at my old workplace but somehow people who couldn't defrag their PC started talking to me about crypto and how I should start investing in IOTA. Literally everyone knew, it was like the dotcom bubble all over again when my football buddy told me to buy Microsoft stocks, that's when I sold. Microsoft and Bitcoin, in the respected timeframes.
The only reason Bitcoin took off so hard in 2017 was because of all those new people who have never heard about it and started getting their money into it. But now there are no significant new people who can get their money into it. Where would the money come from to support an even bigger spike if everybody put it in before?
Don't get me wrong, I believe and hope, for the sake of the economy, it will take off although I don't know why it would.

\&gt;  it's not worth shit
I can sell mine for \~5k$ and then buy goods for that. That seems like worth to me.

I'm not the guy who claimed that number, but I just googled it in 10 seconds:

Not trusting people who're stupid doesn't imply I am not stupid.
But nice try.

Hi, I think we didn't meet before. Let me introduce myself:
I'm the guy that said "it's worth something".
Maybe you're talking to someone else? :|

It's just like in Germany after WWII, everything has been destroyed and that's how it was forever!
