Yeah, it's some pretty awesome stuff!
* What paper do I need? Regular paper fluorescences like crazy, do I still see my UV ink printing?
You will need non fluorescent OBA free paper, we will be providing this on our website for a fairly cheap price in the coming weeks. With fluorescent paper the UV is hard to see.
* How visible is the UV ink under normal lighting?
The ink is invisible, you will not be able to see it! :)
* How stable is the print? How long will it last in darkness? In light? Sunlight?
The print is very stable, the UV ink we use I have worked with for years, and I still have prints from 2 years ago that shine vibrantly under UV light that have been exposed to the sun and light for hours. I will elaborate more on this question shortly.
* What are the properties of the bare ink? Is it as liquid as fountain pen ink, for example? Can I fill a spare fountain pen with this?
Our type of UV ink is a water based ink.  You can fill a spare pen with the UV ink :) The bottles we use for our UV ink have a little plastic needle attached so its fairly easy to refill cartridges/pens.
* Do you plan to offer other UV items? Like UV flashlights or light fixtures?
Yes! We plan on expanding our list of product over time, we hope to sell UV &amp; UV Curing lights, bulbs, lamps, flashlights, and much much more. We want to be the number one source for all UV products. We try and beat all of our competitors pricing as well for the best price possible for high quality product. If you have any suggestions on product you would like to see, just feel free to let us know and I will work on getting it in :)

Stripe has a 0.8% Fee for bitcoin, but the max cap amount is $5. So a $500 payment would be only $4 Fee, compared to a credit card it would be $14.50 + 30 cent fee for a total of $14.80. Bitcoin saves us a lot more money in the long run :) They also have automatic bank deposits, and instant bitcoin to USD if you use that. They have only contacted us once just to veirfy the business and that was it.

That video is really cool! 
This UV light is $35 and is good for displaying whole images that were printed.

They actually sell cheaper ones at other places, such as Lowes/Home Depot has one for about $20 but I could not find a link for it.
This is the type of UV light we are using to display the main pictures on our website,
