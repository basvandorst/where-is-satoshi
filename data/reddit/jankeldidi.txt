The article is almost 2 years old, now look where we are today: BTC has incredibly high transaction fees, so people just use alternatives.
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:07:33
Only some hours, but it might take longer today, because all the exchanges can't even cope with new registrations.

I know but will they soon come? Is there an official release date yet?

buy high, sell low

Lightning imminent?

you can short on Bitmex or Bitfinex.

It's only used as a speculative investment with very fee fundamental use cases.

If you read the article he clearly says he prefers Bitcoin Cash over Bitcoin.

There are currently 20k transactions with a higher fee in the mempool. Maybe you will have to wait hours or days until your transaction is included in a block. That depends on the luck of miners.
@_date: 2018-09-18 09:18:47


That's because some people/exchanges create new wallets rather than reusing old ones. You can move your coins everyday into a new wallet and it's always in a wallet that never made an outgoing transaction.

Is this a subreddit dedicated to hate and mobbing?
There are two threads about Roger on the first page, please grow up and start discussing again. Or is there nothing to discuss?

Where are you seeing transaction batching? The payments/transaction chart is almost flat.
@_date: 2018-06-05 15:06:53
Exactly, the whole narrative "Bitcoin Cash fees are more expensive than Bitcoin fees" is fake news by people that think the reader doesn't understand how Bitcoin works.
@_date: 2018-06-05 15:03:30
BCH has a higher average fee, but that doesn't really matter.
@_date: 2018-06-09 10:28:45
I'm pretty sure this isn't true, from a legal perspective.

I think exchanges went down on purpose like a circuit breaker to prevent a further crash.

Yes, the addresses are part of a list by Chris Ellis from bitfinex.
Here's the list.
@_date: 2019-04-25 19:51:38
About 900 were moved in Jan 2017, see this post by Chris Ellis, since then nothing was moved.

It needs to be updated, though. For example the list of accepting merchants isn't up to date. Steam isn't accepting BTC anymore. Haven't checked the other merchants.

This is the power of HODLing.

I lost my 2FA once (on bitfinex) and I had to provide a photo ID to identify myself. Then they deactivated 2FA.

It's possible that he already sold the Bitcoins OTC (over the counter). I don't think it's going to dump more in the short term, but in the long term the awareness that the trustee has now has approval to sell 140k more BTC will hang like a sword of Damokles over the price.

Thanks for sharing the video.

Kobayashi said that he was seeking approval to sell the remaining coins. Now we see that 16k BTC were moved to the same address that he used before for selling. It's not a conspiracy to assume he already sold them and is going to also sell the remaining 140k.

Bitcoin Cash

Ok, I just saw the title, but the debate is still quite interesting. It's important that we stay together as a community and are open to discussion, because the government wants to destroy Bitcoin by "divide et impera", i.e. they want to split us into adverse groups to break our power as a community.
I'm bullish on both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2018-04-28 11:14:40
What a joke.

I don't understand how this is good news for Bitcoin. Entire industry is going down.
@_date: 2018-12-07 11:07:53
Also think about the barrier of entry for people that want to use Bitcoin. If you need to pay 10$ for a simple transaction, you're not going to use it.
@_date: 2018-12-04 08:58:03
