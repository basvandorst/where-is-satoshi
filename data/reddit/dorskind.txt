Why should OKCoin compromise their platform because of Bitfinex's incompetence? Bitfinex is dead and it's time to let it die, rather than pull other exchanges into this mess.

No. Look up the Sheep Marketplace hackers. They got caught.


Of course they did. It's supposed to be airtight with or without the exit scam, because it's a darknet market.


I disagree. VPN + Whonix won't fail. Run your wallet inside Whonix, too. 
Paying 50% back won't cool off shit. If anything, it will create more leads and demonstrate that the hacker is vulnerable.
@_date: 2016-08-16 02:53:29
What a shill. People can consider using Bitfinex again after they pay everyone back and are fully audited. Until then, anyone who still has money on there is a moron.
@_date: 2016-08-05 10:58:27
They're idiots and they want to pull OKCoin (which is a much larger than exchange than Shitfinex, by the way) into this mess. If there is some evidence that an account belongs to the hacker (e.g. same IP address), then sure, lock it. They shouldn't base their decisions on trading activity.

Not necessarily. A good example is the Evolution Market guys. They ran the largest darknet marketplace in the world and then exit scammed. No one can figure out who they really are.
Every person who has ever got caught for a crime like this messed something up. As long as the hacker doesn't screw up, there will be zero leads. He won't have a life on the run.

I don't think Bitfinex can recover from this. The brand is dead. The Bitfinex brand was already hurting from their downtime in June that caused the bitcoin price to fall $200. This was the final blow, even if someone swoops in with 70 million in capital.

It's not, as evidenced by the Sheep Marketplace case. They stole from every darknet criminal using that marketplace and it was law enforcement, not some bounty hunter that caught them.
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:43:12


If they identity him, they'll let law enforcement handle it.
@_date: 2016-08-11 22:17:59
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:51:50
There are really only 3 groups of people that could possibly identity him. Law enforcement, Bitfinex, and super nerdy computer people. None of those 3 groups would feed him his own eyeballs.
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:17:53
That would only be smart if he believes his identity is known to Bitfinex. (Maybe some nonanonymous user accidentally noticed a bug and then stole all the coins using a valid identity.) Hire a lawyer immediately to negotiate a deal with Bitfinex to keep some coins (although I'm guessing it would be a few million at most if his identity is known to Bitfinex) and avoid prosecution.
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:10:56
Oh fuck you, you biased twat. If you held the amount of bitcoins that some idiots had on Shitfinex, you'd want answers now. This happens every time an exchange screws up - the people who didn't lose money tell everybody to get over it. They're too stupid and selfish to realize that some people's lives were just ruined.

A Bitfinex shutdown would be good for Bitcoin. They're been destroying the price since June with their antics. It's time for better exchanges to take their place.

Yes. Some people are so foolish that they're still using Bitfinex.
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:49:54
If the hacker isn't a complete idiot, they won't be able to trace it.
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:29:30
OKCoin has CNY spot, USD spot, and USD futures. Bitfinex only has one type of order book. It's hard to measure size, because these exchanges operate different types of markets with different fee structures.
I can tell you one thing for certain, though. OKCoin has much better liquidity. Maybe it's the zero fee structure in play, but I can put a 100 BTC sell order in on OKCoin at spot price and it will get picked up within a minute, while on Bitfinex it will likely take several minutes.
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:31:20
Regardless, I think you mean "was"
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:24:11
This same thing happened in June when their downtime caused the price to crash $200 in a day. I literally went from being up 75K that week (I'm not a multimillionaire or anything yet, so that's a buttload of money) to being down 30K overall for the week. Bitfinex just deferred blame, saying stuff like "the price was already going down beforehand" and "users should have hedged their positions on other exchanges". In the end, they took zero responsibility and told everyone to go screw themselves.
I withdrew every penny I had on Bitfinex following that fiasco. I got lucky on that front.
@_date: 2016-08-05 09:10:06
Bitfinex has denied a lot of things.
@_date: 2018-01-13 14:09:41
It's a "private listing", which means you can't see the names of the bidders. This is often used to allow the seller to shill without the bidders realizing it.

Open the AETL transaction simulator. Paste your address, the amount of coins, and click send. Be careful though, if you don't properly clear the RSE container, you could cause your bitcoin address to become permanently invalid and costing you any bitcoins that it holds. Think of it like creating a black hole, because the negative ionic deformula within the RSE container creates what is literally a hole in the fabric of the blockchain. Once this occurs, coins never come out.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:36:40
I don't like it, it's too centralized and holds increased risks as a result. Not that this would even be possible with the "top-10 exchanges" because they have quite different ways of doing things.

Now, I don't know about millions, but $10K is so absurd that I think you must be trolling. Bitcoins.com is a great brandable domain for any Bitcoin-business. It's also a great portfolio booster for anyone that wants to act important. I'd give $100K just to put a big picture of my face on the index page so I can say I own bitcoins.com.

It was panic due to Bitfinex. Not because an exchange with like 5% of the market share matters, but because that's all that was needed to trigger a crash. 
Do you think bitcoin is worth a few billion dollars more because a couple of Chinese dudes decided to buy this month? Short term price fluctuations don't accurately reflect the value of the industry.
It doesn't take much during a pump to knock the price back down. The Bitfinex outages are directly correlated with both segments of the crash from $740 to $680 and then $715 to $640. If you were trying to time the sell-off, that sure as hell mattered. If you're just a long term hodler or in fiat, you probably don't give a crap because it was going to correct sooner or later anyway.
@_date: 2016-06-21 19:23:59
It did recover. It went back up to $715, then Bitfinex went offline again in the morning and now we're here. There's no question that we were sitting precariously at $750, but there's also no question that Bitfinex was the cause of the crash last night and this morning.

Nah, he just didn't lose that much money in the crash so he can't relate. The price is bouncing back up a bit, but Bitfinex caused a lot of damage to the price yesterday. They went offline TWICE and caused the price to crash a full 10%. Whether or not Bitfinex completely destroyed the bulltrend remains to be seen - we may not be able to recover back up to $750.
@_date: 2016-06-21 17:43:59

The price was $744 when Bitfinex first went offline. After they came back up, it recovered to $710. Then, they went offline again and sent the price to like $640, although it's back up to $680 now. That's still a billion dollars off of the Bitcoin market cap. They caused a lot of damage yesterday - not just to individuals who didn't do well during the crash, but to the overall bulltrend we've been experiencing.

Unless you're selling these courses for the cost of a community college course or positioning yourself as some guru (learn the secrets of how I make $5,000/day trading penny stocks - that sort of crap), there's no way you're getting people to spend money at your "university".
The only thing keeping online universities afloat are the degrees. What's the point of forking over a lot of money for information that you could have found for free? Plenty of real universities offer free or inexpensive online courses and information. Even if you're offering the best information in the world, it will just get pirated if there's no incentive for students to pay for a course.
Based on your opinions on copyright, I actually think you're best off sharing the information for free and accepting donations. Use it as a project to gain some experience so that later on you can start a business that has a chance of making money.

Most of them are trust companies to get around state licensing. A notable exception is Coinbase, which as usual chooses to make things harder for themselves and their customers.


They are all over the Internet, you just don't know where to look, either due to lack of experience or lack of intelligence. Hopefully it's the former, as most of these laws are so convoluted that you just have to take your best guess or copy what everyone else is doing. I think you're looking for "How to Start a Bitcoin Exchange for Dummies", but that just doesn't exist. I don't know why you'd expect it to.

Why would you care? You run a university, not a drug trafficking operation. The worst that can happen to you are bank account closures and visits from federal agents asking questions.
I think your idea is silly and complicated. Nobody intelligent enough to use Bitcoin is also stupid enough to pay a lot of money for a for-profit university. Also, people will have trouble with student loans because the funds have to be converted into bitcoin before your university gets paid.

Exchanges like Gemini fulfill all legal obligations without stealing whenever necessary to maintain a profit on each customer.
GDAX is also not a real exchange. They don't allow other MSBs or exchanges to trade with their service.

Most people sell when the price goes down.

You must be new. Ripple has been a top shitcoin for years.

Everyone would leave immediately? Look at what happened with Bitfinex, plenty of people would stay.

I highly recommend that you do not purchase on LocalBitcoins. Many LocalBitcoins sellers, including myself, will "rat you out" to the government if they are suspicious of you. Heck, most LocalBitcoins sellers, including myself, will file forms with the government on a $15K transaction, even if they're not suspicious of you!
Want a one-way trip to prison? Buy bitcoins for illegal purposes on LocalBitcoins.

They don't need your fucking $4K lmfao. ATMs don't cost shit compared to running an ATM business.

How do you expect to start a "university" when you don't even have the capital to hire someone?

There's a broad spectrum of what mentally ill is. Bill Gates was freaking autistic (mentally ill), should he not be managing his money?

You're a moron if you think the coins can't be properly anonymized because the government will try to track them.

It's not over until your mother in law starts buying.

Or the "B" when it's improper. In this dude's title, it should be stated as "bitcoins".

I don't get offended. I feel you're making too big of a deal out of this if you think I'm bothered by your business endeavours. 
I'm here on Reddit, dicking around with a bunch of faceless usernames, so why would I care about avoiding conflict?

The purpose of a post like that is not to get clicks. You're trying to build recognition for the products your company offers.

This article got everything wrong. Michel Espinoza got off. Pascal Reid plead guilty to unlicensed money transmission/related charges and is the one who must teach law enforcement about bitcoin.
Edit: And neither of them stole anything.

Your insight is very appreciated. I noticed on your website that you ATM is currently not operating, though - I assume that is unrelated to the actual machine?

If that's the strategy, just short the currency.

No, it will go to fiat, because BTC will go down with it. Not as far or as fast, but the whole market (BTC included) is inflated right now.

It's not a passport - it's just an ID. They just happen to call it a passport.
Honestly, you can put any number there you want - just remember it.
