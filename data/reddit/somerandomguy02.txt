That's all fine and dandy but on a week chart [we're nearly oversold, on the losing cycle of a MACD and way way waaaay above the 200 period EMA.]( It's not the first time it's corrected back to the 200 period after a huge run like that and that's a 60% loss if he bought right now. It's definitely correcting back to at least the 50 period(red line) over the next two or three months.
[On the daily we still haven't bucked the downward trendline.]( We're on a fib retracement support line.
I'd hate to see him lose 30% to 60% when he could just wait five months or so and start out at $4000 to $6000 instead.
Markets are markets and mark my words, it's gonna correct on it's own back to the fast moving average and the dumpers are gonna keep dumping until it corrects back to the slow moving average. They're just systematically offloading what they bought on the run up to do it all again to a new all time high.

I think you're doing it too soon. Please go take a look at the ride to the top and see all the artificial pumps from groups(or a few whales) buying a shitton all at once. I'm convinced those super highs were semi artificial and that it still has a ways to go down. Double top and bear market we're in for a bit with the pumpers and dumpers now slowly dumping their holdings in waves.
Go a take a look at the ride up at a 15 or 30 minute timeline over a month or two. Use tradingview or something with candlesticks. You'll see huge jumps from groups pumping but not dumps that bring it down to the original level. That's what they're doing now, dumping everything over a month or two.
Lots of those pumps are on the hour too. Go look at the most recent smaller pumps and dumps these last two weeks at a one minute timeframe. Happens exactly on the hour a lot of them. 9am pump, 12 noon pump, 3pm dump, 5pm dump, 8pm dump all in one day.

You're hanging hope on a prayer and trying to fit data to your hopes. Changing the percentage to a log scale would only try and confirm your bias and has nothing to do with reality. We're not very close. If anything, the log prediction is accelerating away from the price.
Ok, in October of this year and then again in January of 2020, remember this conversation and my prediction:

And lol, wait a minute. You have that on a compressed log scale anyway. According to your site it's a full 87% ***below***(or at only 13%) of the logarithmic prediction.
[Linear of the log prediction all time.](
[And according to the log prediction it should be at $81,442 per BTC right now.](
You're basing your bitcoin advice on a log prediction that is starting to prove itself wrong? I think *you're* the one who needs to study it more. Surely that's just a joke of someone trying to explain McAfee's "million dollars by 2021"

[It actually *is* on it's way down for the next day or two.](
It could hit that Fibonacci line at $9600, bounce a little and go sideways or go all the way down to the pitchfork median around tomorrow morning Eastern time. My bet is the median line at $9400 or so.
Either way, not making any money for a couple of days.

I'm making a calculated decision based on technical analysis and you know that Fibonacci retracement chart I have up on my screenshots? It's exponential. I am using exponential growth and retraction based on the golden ratio. You're the one not making a calculated decision. 
Cracking me up that chart you linked. Just remember $7000 and $5400 in a few months.


IT DOESN'T EVEN COME CLOSE TO MATCHING lmao

lol, you explained it quite well. It and you are just so beyond wrong.
