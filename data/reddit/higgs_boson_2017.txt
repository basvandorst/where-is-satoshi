Everything which makes it great is still in place, which is to say nothing. Nothing makes it great. Get out now

The work that it takes to create an application that can support 2 billion users is monumental. Blockchain is just data storage. Niche data storage with very little use or purpose. Blockchain has nothing at all to do with *network effect*.

Blockchain is incredibly simple, there is almost nothing to it, you can just use hyperledger. Bitcoin will die

The only use of bitcoin for payments was drugs and malware ransom. It was never, and never will be, a currency, its just a speculative commodity.
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:17:24
It has no utility, which is why the floor is $0, there is backstop, no support

&lt;$2k is the future

If you like $3800, you're gonna love $2500, and then $1000, and then $100...

There is no reason to compare a simple data storage technique to a website that handles 2 Billion users.

True, expect blockchain is basically useless, you can't replace a database with blockchain, it doesn't do 1% of a what a database does.
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:03:49
To be clear, it will never recover, there is no support, it will go to zero
@_date: 2018-11-19 23:37:11
This won't age well

Anecdote much?
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:58:32
Its $6100, you buying?
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:12:47
Yeah, asset would be a better word. And yes, beanie babies is the right comparison.
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:57:07
Haha, No. It's a speculative commodity, its being traded. There is a payment in my life in the last year that could have been made with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:11:28
You don't need bitcoin to use blockchain
@_date: 2018-11-19 23:39:18
Bitcoin will never have a "doing" to be undone.
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:58:46
It will stabilize. At $0
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:45:26
Its about on par with the number of people using chickens as payment
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:42:43
How is that an insult? Did I attack you? A group of people?
There is nothing to debate. Am I going to convince you that the future of bitcoin is complete collapse? No. Are you going to convince me that its not Beanie Babies 2.0 (TM)? No.
I'll leave you with a parting thought: A decentralized currency akin to Bitcoin isn't the ultimate in freedom, its the ultimate in tyranny. Imagine a world where political leaders can be paid off with untraceable money. Sound like utopia?
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:55:20
As a speculative commodity, its not intended to be used.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:07:54
Past performance is not an indicator.... nevermind

Buffet was talking about stocks in stable companies, not speculation in commodities
