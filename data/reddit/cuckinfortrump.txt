Wow! Hodling for SIX MONTHS!!!??? Is that a world record, guys? I didn’t think any human being had a strong enough will to hold an investment for that long! You definitely deserve a reward for such an amazing feat.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:27:51
People like you deserve to have all of your money taken away and be put on an allowance by the government.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:58:43
I honestly might just sell all my bitcoin. Not because of whatever paranoid bullshit you just spouted, but because people as stupid as you getting involved with bitcoin means the end is near for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:30:15
We get it. You have your tail between your legs, sand in your vagina, and you're scared of your own shadow. Please just sell all of your bitcoin and be gone.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:05:11
You had a loss when you panic sold on Friday. You're a coward.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:49:04
Can you recognize written Swahili? No? Well it's the same as me not being able to recognize written german. Irrelevant languages spoken by backwards people in small, irrelevant countries don't interest me.
So you don't deny it then? You suffered a loss because you're a coward who panic sold?
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:05:37
You paid FOR AN ENTIRE MEAL??!!! Are you one of those bitcoin whales I keep hearing about? I think you probable are. You have to have 1,000+ bitcoins if you can afford to pay for a meal. I hope to be just like you when I grow up and earn the respect of my family by paying for a whole meal.

I sold a lot of my furniture over the past week and invested the proceeds into bitcoin. Realized I really didn't need to sit on a couch while watching TV. Can just as easily sit on my carpet. Sold my dining table too and got a few stools instead. Now I eat at my kitchen counter but I have a lot more bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:02:20
One more weak hand off the ship before the boost from futures tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:31:10
No idea what any of that means. I don't speak whatever language a Euro coward like you speaks. Either way, I don't see you denying that you didn't suffer a loss because of your cowardice.
Why are you cowards even allowed to invest your money? Maybe all of that extra money you cucks have to put into bitcoin should go to extra taxes that your countries can use to defend themselves, instead of relying on my country and my tax dollars funding NATO.

MY GOD!!!
All those scared little cucks warning us about a short by Wall Street were right. I've never seen such a massive drop in my life, and I jumped off the Grand Canyon once. This is October 1929 all over again.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:45:44
Similar to how if you're wife never cheats on you again, you will have gotten lucky. You played russian roulette with your marriage each time you forgave her for her transgressions.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:01:08
Yeah considering it's at 14,400+ now, not bad indeed. Glad a scared little child like you got a loss from bitcoin. Don't buy bitcoin again. You'll make the rest of us look bad.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:13:19
Saw that you panic sold. Explains a lot. Like the fact that you're a scared little man. Enjoy your losses, buddy.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:52:50
So you sell when it falls and buy in when it rises again? Great strategy there, Slick.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:44:43
Futures products aren't sold by the average investor. They're sold by banks. If a bank has to pay money out on a short, it means the bank lost money. Banks aren't stupid. They're not gonna be fooled by shadowy Wall Street investors who somehow can easily manipulate the bitcoin price up and down.
Right now we don't know for sure how futures rolling out will affect the bitcoin price, but even if the price goes down, it won't be because of price manipulation by shadowy Wall Street investors who are trying to profit from a short. Not to mention that there aren't gonna be any short products offered that pay out if the price of bitcoin crashes the day after futures start lol. People who believe in these ridiculous conspiracy theories are patently stupid or they're children.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:41:23
Bitcoin tends to attract a lot of paranoid, libertarian idiots. You'll see plenty of posts that say "Gubment/Wall Street is coming for your bitcoin! Be very afraid!" These are the same people who think 9/11 was an inside job. If you listen to them, you're an even bigger idiot than they are.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:11:04
Don't listen to me at your own financial peril. I'm telling you and anyone else who will listen, bitcoin will shoot up tomorrow. Catch a ride on the train while you can. If you have a college fund for your kids, put it all in bitcoin before tomorrow. If you have an emergency fund, put all of it in bitcoin before tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:55:28
Your wife is running around on you.
Just fair warning.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:21:12
Those dastardly Wall Streeters!!! Always foiling our plan to make money. We could have gotten away with it too if it wasn't for those meddling banks and their stupid dog Streety Doo.
God you people are dumb.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:16:33
Honestly, use your kid's college fund, or your emergency fund, or even take out a loan if you have to. Buy as much bitcoin as you can. This is how people get rich.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:17:14
You're a stupid person who has irrational fears of shadowy Wall Street investors who are out to get you.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:49:39
Remember you never answered my question, and your wife never stayed faithful to you throughout your marriage. Who is gonna be paying out these short positions?
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:54:06
Who is gonna be paying out these short positions? It's gonna be financial institutions. They offer short positions to make money, not have to pay out on a short position to apparently all of Wall Street and lose massive amounts of money.
If only these financial institutions had the foresight to hire a paranoid, uninformed idiot like you they'd know exactly when Big Bad Wall Street is gonna manipulate the bitcoin price to crash.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:37:01
What were you saying again? Sorry I was busy fucking your wife.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:14:01
Lol you're not talking about losses anymore because you suffered them. I truly feel sorry for anyone who depends on you financially because you're a coward and you lose money because of it.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:38:45
You're doing it wrong. It costs $0 to hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:57:47
Honestly, you should just sell dude. This thing is about to drop another 10k or so over the next few hours. Try to salvage what little money you can.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:04:33
I'm angry because your wife is trying to claim that the children you're raising are mine and that I owe her child support.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:58:23
Guys, I gotta be honest. I bought in around the 16-17k mark for bitcoin. Same thing for the rest of my crypto portfolio. I believed in this technology so much from reading all of y'all's optimism on reddit that I invested everything I had into cryptos. All of my savings, my emergency fund, my kids' college fund, even the majority of my paychecks since November, purposefully going past due on my bills thinking I could pay the late fees and still make a profit next month. 
Hell, I even sold most of my furniture thinking I could make a profit in a few weeks and buy much nicer furniture.
Right now, I'm basically on the brink of failure in life. I don't know how to explain this to my wife. I don't know how I will explain this to my kids when they are older. As sad as this sounds, the only out I see for myself is jumping off of the tallest building in my city. Please convince me that bitcoin's price will rise. My kids need a dad, but if bitcoin keeps falling, maybe they don't need a dad who will squander all of their money.
Edit - Honestly, y'alls' comments were sobering and humbling. I spoke with my wife and explained the situation to her. She was obviously pissed. We have decided to cash out all of our crypto holdings in the morning and try to salvage what we can. I think that is the best decision for our family. Hopefully I can buy back in at some point after tomorrow and ride the wave with you guys once more. Good luck to all of you and may all of you become filthy rich.

So you're all in, but you don't want me to tell other people to go all in? Sounds like you want other people to miss out on gains that you'll get. Talk about heartless.
Taking out a subprime home mortgage was irresponsible, and yet actual financial advisors recommended it all the time. Taking out a loan for a rapidly appreciating asset makes perfect sense.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:31:05
I hope for your sake, you listen to my advice.
