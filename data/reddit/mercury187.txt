I have shift and bitpay but I don’t really have a lot of crypto so I haven’t actually used them anywhere. Is this wirex card any better or different? I plan to use the cards I have possibly in December as the alts I hold have started to go up, I figure I’ll take some profits in December to have money for the holidays.

Do you know of any pre paid credit cards that work on coinbase ? My card quit working

Rats cex and coinmama don't accept my state, someone recommended bitit on another thread saying they are legit however they will probably reject me too. I guess I am just SOL with trying to get crypto with a CC? I refuse to enter banking info with coinbase, I guess I could open an alternate account at some bank and make deposits and then send that to coinbase, really drawn out process :(

It's on a sliding scale it looks like, to buy 50$ worth the fee was 11.something (24%), to buy 100$ worth it was 12.something (12%) and then when I put in 200$ it was 15.80 (around 8%)

Is that fees on buying through bank transfer? What if you transfer money from bank to coinbase USDT wallet? Then transfer the USDT to gdax and buy btc there as a maker order? (I read they only have fees on taker orders)
@_date: 2018-04-08 21:16:13
Where can I get one of those?

it was cpu minable only 7 years ago? man I must have lived under a rock
@_date: 2018-04-08 20:53:36
if you send usdt to coinbase and then send the usdt from coinbase to gdax and buy with a maker order (they say only taker orders pay fees) then you don't pay any fees correct? Thats the way I've been doing it and don't think i've seen any fees..
