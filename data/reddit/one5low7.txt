Litecoin and Monero are pretty good, but they are alts. I keep my main in BTC.

I got audited once and it turned out the IRS owed me money, lol. I got lucky though, don't fuck with them.

The reason that banks won't do credit card purchases for BTC was because people were maxing out their credit on BTC, paying it off the next month when they sell, worked well for a while except banks weren't making any interest. Then when BTC was worth like $20k and it crashed, a lot people owed a lot money that they couldn't afford to pay back.

Bitcoin will probably adapt to the changes of the future, I would actually bet on it.

Yeah, the UK is basically a bank for the rest of Europe. It's a pretty small group of islands that don't really produce a whole lot of physical goods for export, their advantage is basically a launch point to the rest of the world.

But at the same time you would also have the skills and knowledge, so in theory if your any sort of IT person, you could bring things like lightning network and other advances that are currently known, which have made it better, like 15 years before it was developed. So you would still be advancing the project

No wonder I've been a lot of alerts from coinbase today.

I usually buy on coinbase, transfer to GDAX, then transfer to my hard wallet on electrum.

I can get at least 1 heroin bean for that much.

For all the shit coinbase gets around here, they never did me dirty like that.

I hope it does hit that price because I've invested a lot of my personal time into bitcoin, but the last thing I ever want to see is that crazy mother fucker eating his dick.

There is a way to prove he invented it, if he actually did, but he didn't. In all likelihood it was probably someone that's already dead. But yes, the person that did invent bitcoin would have the "genesis coin".

He'll only spend 3 years with parole.

The price of bitcoin doesn't go up, the value of the USD goes down...
