Ya we should be more like the middle east. Fucking idiot. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 15:46:51
Loooool this is proof of nothing. Easy business decision. Simple as that.  
@_date: 2018-09-22 19:13:43
How on earth do you come to the conclusion that it is a retarded business decision? Are you their financial analyst? Do you have inside information to their accounts? Or... are you just some random person who says things that have no evidence to back up your claim?  Also to your question of why would you bank their if they can take your money. Remember you dont have to, you are free to do business elsewhere, because remember you have freedom and stuff.  Looooool

The entire middle east, china etc etc. Lol you whining conservatards actually think your speech is being censored is adorable
@_date: 2018-09-23 02:16:46
Again, unless you have access to their financial team and numbers they pull or know people inside, you simply cannot say a statement of "not at all financially motivated". You are talking about some of the richest corporations in the world, and you are claiming it has 0 to do with money. That might be the craziest thing I have heard.  
Edit* also no one is depriving him of his ability to speak freely. He may do that within the confines of the law as he pleases. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 15:28:42
Lol intolerance. It's a business decision. They view him as a liability, therefore no more doing business with him. This whole "but muh free speech is being c3nsored!!!" is the dumbest shit ever.
@_date: 2018-09-22 15:48:46
Exactly. These fucking idiots think they are allowed to say anything on any platform without consequence.

I promise you this will not even put any sort of dent in paypal at all. Although who knows the stock is down 40 cents today! 
@_date: 2018-09-23 02:09:17
No, no it isn't. It's removing a disruptive customer. Lol this isn't censorship. 
@_date: 2018-09-23 02:04:02
You can't prove that, and I can't prove the liability issue. We are both guessing, either way this has nothing to do with "muh free speech" and more to do with business rights. 
@_date: 2018-09-23 01:55:30
They see negative press. 
@_date: 2018-09-23 02:24:03
Just as I think others might now join. This is all speculation. 
@_date: 2018-09-23 02:39:58
Lol a 15 year bet? Cmon son. 
@_date: 2018-09-23 02:32:37
Would you like to put a bet on that paypal's stock will be below it's price right now this time next year? I mean you think they are doing a terrible job. 
@_date: 2018-09-23 02:06:45
Actually there are many many people saying this a free speech issue in the comments. 
@_date: 2018-09-23 02:20:12
Public image is tied to money. 
@_date: 2018-09-23 01:46:21
I have no idea what you are even talking about. They see him as costing their company money is what I am saying. 
@_date: 2018-09-23 01:45:14
Great response, you're doing terrific here. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 15:45:21
Oh christ, you fucking losers with your victim mentality. Your freedom of speech isnt being censored. Obviously you dont understand business and business decisions. Last time I checked alex jones can set up a server and say or do whatever he wants to the extent of the law.  Stop this nonsense of fake censorship, it hurts the actual people who are truly being suppressed.
@_date: 2018-03-16 16:28:23
Who's shaming what now? I'm talking realistic outlooks/expectations. Do we really always need to see things like "Why Bitcoin will save your grandmas life when she gets terminal cancer!", "Bitcoin is like a hedge of sorts against the whole world falling apart".
These are the titles that drive people nuts about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 20:35:31
ok, please explain then. Ill wait
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:23:18
This is why people don't like bitcoin, because of stupid titles like this. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 16:19:06
It's not about liking or not liking it, it's about keeping realistic outlooks on what it actually is and is doing. People get too caught up in the hype without actually seeing it for what it is. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 16:16:45
I own bitcoin tho. I'm saying people who think bitcoin is the greatest thing since sliced bread is annoying. We get it, you think it's great. Realistically it hasn't revolutionized anything, or done anything at all. It might have potential but we have yet to see it. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 15:08:48
Ok so heres the thing, you demonstrated it perfectly. Buying bitcoin is a complete gamble, there is no secret formula, no one has a clue what it will do. Your background in gambling is exactly why you bought bitcoin, to gamble, it is just a different form.

"Investment"  lol
