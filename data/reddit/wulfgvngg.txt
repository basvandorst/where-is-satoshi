Seriously, this is so early game we’re not even worried about these 5% drops .. if you can’t handle that, you don’t deserve to ride the 20+ gains daily!

FINALLY SOME ACTION !even if it falls or corrects under 3.8k or lower than 3k less than 1k.. doesn't matter, ill be securing muh bags! HODL
@_date: 2019-04-01 16:51:11
didnt i back the truck up? im neither bullish or bearish, im just tryna accumulate.. my bad 
@_date: 2019-04-03 16:56:51
anything under 5k, this is all just my opinion and don't think it will happen; I want BTC less than 3k or even 1k to secure more bags lol but anything in 4.2k lows where it was struggling to pass is a discount. the Low in Nov 2018 of 3.1k maybe not reached again? What yall think

isnt this everybody? sorry to sound like an ass but people should just stop dwelling on the what ifs.. everyone has these stories its like.. not again
@_date: 2019-04-02 04:42:23
ITS HAPPENING!!! i believe ! lets go HODLERs we stayed the storm, really looks maybe we had bottomed out? 3.5k was bottom? im hoping we can still secure cheap 3k bags but im happy w what i had accumulated.. nice! lets go

Reaccumulation time was that &lt;7k still A LOT of time, we are Early adopters. ONLY 2.2 million BTC wallets have more than 1000$ USD and there are about 16 MIL Active users with at least 1$ so you can see not many speculators; but the top players have many coins, also more addresses today have at least 1BTC! 
ofcourse this is all guesses, but ill be going out on a limb: 2020 Halving May: 12k-16k start of 2021 19k-20k EOY 2021 250k+ 2022
all predictions, sorry if you BUY with my crystal ball (;
