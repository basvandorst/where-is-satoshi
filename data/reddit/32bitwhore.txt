Bought in two days ago. Already made 20 bucks. Is this what it feels like to be rich?

Same. I jumped on the train yesterday, dumped $200 into it and made like $5 since yesterday. I'll take it!

Nah, not unless you're using old inefficient cards to mine with or using gaming overclocks instead of underclocking and power limiting the GPU. I mine ETH for fun with my card when I'm not using the PC and I make my electricity back by about double at current prices.
I don't feel bad about mining because I only have one card and I bought it specifically for gaming. It just happens to be good at mining on the side.

In big box electronics that's usually not the case. Plus, if it's corporate you can probably only order from their warehouse, so if there isn't anything to order, not much you can do.

That's kind of how I see it. It's like saying an individual stock that goes up is combating inflation. Sure, it might be, temporarily, but it will never last permanently and will fall victim to it just like every other form of currency. And this is like, a pretty volatile "stock" to put all of your eggs into.

If it's a chain store, no way the manager does any ordering, it's all automated. Corporate sucks at their job.

You guys can't really believe it works like this, can you? Deflation over 2 years vs. inflation over 100 years is not even close to a fair comparison, to start. Secondly, deflation of this scale discourages an active economy (as we've already seen with BTC) and makes it worse, especially with a limited currency like BTC. People sit on their BTC and don't spend it because it's an investment. Third, cost of goods/services and salaries are (though sometimes poorly) adjusted for inflation. If you got paid $10/hr in 1929 you were doing really, really well. If you get paid $10 in 2017 you can barely make ends meet. Finally, you can't honestly believe that deflation will continue at the rate it has been with BTC forever.

Thanks for the tips, I'll watch it a bit more closely from here on.

Every time I'm like "nah I think I missed the boat on BTC, no point in investing now," you fuckers make them worth even more money. Fuck.
