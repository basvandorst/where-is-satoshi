There are regulations around inside trading for stocks and securities. Legally, crypto currency is neither so those rules do not apply to it...yet...

Literacy Bridge makes an open source, talking book device that functions like a community library in illiterate communities that live on less than $2 a day.  Communities members listen to educational content repeatedly (since audio content in these rural areas is hard to come by) and the impact of these Talking Books is tremendous. Subsistence level farmers see a 40% increase in crop production one growing season after Talking Book programs are launched in their villages after adjusting their farming practices based on the educational content - this is HUGE because that means a huge increase on income for families there. Literacy Bridge's programs are typically focused on health care and agriculture. 
Literacy Bridge was founded by an Apache Software Foundation community member (Cliff Schmidt) and has accepted bitcoin donations for many years. They run on a shoestring budget so even a single bitcoin donation would make a big difference to them. 
Their bitcoin donation link:

It actually helps with almost half of them but no one here expects the bitcoin ecosystem to stay in its current state. New services are being announced every day in this subreddit. 
In some parts of the world, mobile air time usage is being used to create a credit score for consumers. Given how transparent the blockchain is, I expect its only a matter of time before someone comes up with a bitcoin "credit score" (for better or worse!).

The hotel industry is hurting because user acquisition costs are so high. When I worked in the travel space, I read a report that said about 40% of your room rate goes to the hotel paying to convert you as a customer. Expedia takes roughly 30% commissions. So hotels are looking to other revenue streams, such as paid wifi, food and possibly even a business model like this. May take awhile to get adoption but still possible!
Booking tip: call the hotel and ask them to beat or match the Expedia rate. More often than not, they will and then you get a more generous cancellation policy.

I agree - remove the qr code and add more info about the team - maybe link to other online identities.

This concept works well when there is a big spread in BTC prices in local markets. I went to Brazil this winter and the bitcoin price was 30% higher in real than in dollars.  So a traveler could send their BTC down, convert and get 30% more real than if they were exchanging dollars.

I was hoping the Canadians would play nice...

It is a question of what do they expect will actually be donated. Nonprofits on shoe string budgets don't even have a few thousand dollars to ask accountants about the implications of accepting bitcoins on just the hope that someone *might* donate. In this case, the bounced donation would have been one of their biggest donations ever - also making it highly improbable. 
Bitpay/Coinbase are easy ways to get started - and I hope there are many more easy ways to get started in the future for people of varying technical and financial know-how and with varying degrees of financial risk.

Two things to consider:
1) Tech know-how / ease of use:
Not every merchant, nonprofit, individual in the world wants to manage their own bitcoin account. 
2) Accounting resources:
Nonprofits often receive probono accounting services and are not in a position to ask their accountants to start handling digital currency transactions in their books. (We all know the pain of figuring out the tax implications of our bitcoins). So services like Coinbase and Bitpay help make things easier.

harvard.edu didn't work either. looks like all the BTC-love is staying on one side of Cambridge...

Can't we all just get along?!?!?

Thank you! I have been looking for something like this. At the end of last year, I asked one of the nonprofits that I always donate to if I could donate in bitcoin and that I would help them set up, but they declined because they said it was beyond their abilities at the time:/ So I moved my charity budget over to another nonprofit (literacybridge.org) I know that does accept bitcoin (it helps that the executive director is a coder so he is comfortable with all of this). I'll send this over to both organizations!

Wow, wrong on candidates. I'm 100% sure Jed has never lived in Japan.

Ya, I got a frantic email from their team member who had been learning about how to set up the bitcoin donations page - it is a huge bummer considering that donation would have provided educational programs to several villages. But hopefully, this post will find the donor (or new ones) who are moved by their mission.

Joyce from Stellar here. Thanks for taking the time to read it and post your initial thoughts. I echo your sentiment abt the community being open minded: we should all focus on ways to be supportive of experimentation in the space as it is early days and I fundamentally believe we are all working towards the common goal of making financial infrastructure more win-win for the world.  
We are having a dev meetup in SF on April 21 where Prof. Mazières will be talking about this in more detail, so feel free to come by.

Joyce from Stellar here. Thanks for your comment but actually that is an incorrect understanding of the fork and the safety of the prior system. From a prior HN comment: "The fork you are describing occurred in the previous protocol when all the nodes had the same UNL; the failure had everything to do with that previous protocol's response to overloading (it diverges based on timeouts, rather than getting stuck, and discards the losing fork on healing) and nothing to do with trust topology. So it didn't have anything to do with improperly set up trust." Hope that helps explain things for you.
