TBH, people who do understand valuation were calling $100k BTC. I mean, it might still happen, but it all depends on whether granny HODL.

Just point out that Bitcoin crashed from $1k six years ago. If you had held at that point, you'd be cashing out at 1200% ROI over a six-year period.

Meh, there's a bit of a dip. Went from $600 to $380. Fortunately hardware is tough to come by, so the coin rate is pretty much the same.

The professor's not wrong if you assume he isn't an idiot and is talking about buying in now. Correction is ahead, my friends.

Pricks are important. They burst bubbles.

I lost two BTC that were transacting during that fiasco. I filed the claim with the bankruptcy proceedings and they claimed I never sent it. Oh well.

TBH, Satoshi must've been more than one person.

It was the growing pains of a new currency. Now tons of places accept bitcoin as payment, which would have been nice back then.

Hi me! How's the bankruptcy proceedings treating you? I was denied because they "found no such claim", despite my claim being accurate to the dollar. I've given up on seeing that $1,026.

Seems you have really good fortune. Glad to hear you got out before the bust. I'll admit, I made some decent money, so I'm not entirely bitter about it. These things happen in business.

JP Morgan is planning on using Zcash for their enterprise blockchain platform.^[[1]](

We tried that. It didn't work. When the Panic of 1907 spurred the creation of the Fed, recession in business and trade were regularly double digits. We're talking a 22.6% average prior to the fed and 9.5% after.^[[1]](

That's not what fall guy means. A fall guy is someone you setup in your organization to take the hit if shit hits the fan. A fall guy is a patsy, a scapegoat, a can-carrier. 
You're talking about him being made an example of. This is when the justice system decides to punish someone extremely harshly, so as to send a message to other criminals. The intent is to make others think twice about committing a similar crime.
