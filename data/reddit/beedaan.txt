Dude, what planet are you living on?

The funny thing is I actually agree with you about student loans and the price of education.  I also think that has more to do with government policy creating artificially low interest rates for students when a commercial Bank in their right mind would never give an 18 year old a loan below 15%.
The example I gave was for a car though.  Car prices have stayed relatively in line with wages so no inflation here.  Are you seriously suggesting we would be better off without a financial system to offer a loan?
Also, when it comes to people borrowing money they probably should'nt, you can't protect people from themselves.  And I don't think the system should do that.  Financial institution simply offer tools for buyers and investors.  If you were to cut off your arm with a rotary saw, it's not the saw's fault.  And that's not a reason to get rid of power tools.

Let's get on the same page about this.  The person buys the house, the bank lends the money, the house is collateral if the person defaults.  The bank does not buy the house. The bank has a lein on a house. If the person defaults, then it's possible for the bank to own the house but only then.

What is the global reserve currency the fed killed?  The US dollar?

Can you provide evidence to support this?

To be totally honest, the fact that the supply of Bitcoin cannot be altered is concerning.  The 2008 great recession would have been much worse if the fed did not intervene.

I'll go along with your questions, but let's get on the same page.  Banks don't buy houses.

Dodd Frank was a little piece of legislation that came out after 2008 that specifically prevents the great recession happening again.  I would call that a fix.  And yes, the stock market is not the majority of the market.  The US market is primarily made up of small to mid size companies. What makes you say the economy worse today that it was in 2007?

You're saying the fed delayed the housing market crash?  Explain
@_date: 2018-04-18 18:10:50
My friend, I am sorry but you are missing an important detail.  You are saying that the 2008 housing crisis was caused by low-interest rates.  Now that we have low-interest rates again, we are destined for another housing crisis. All of this is caused by the Fed and we would be better off without them.


2008 was a housing *crisis*, and subprime lending was at the heart of it.  Borrowers were defaulting on their loans on a massive scale because they were not able to pay them.  That is simply not happening anymore.  Borrowing requirements have increased since then and we have Dodd-Franke to thank (something that you laugh at).


I'll give you this; housing prices are high now.  However, what you are suggesting is that there is going to be a crash caused by the supply and demand curves finding an equilibrium.  I do think housing prices will fall to meet demand, but it will not be a crisis.  We are not talking about wide-spread defaults and the market's exposure to these defaults due to MBS and CDOs.

I'm not sure what's funny.  At the heart of the 2008 recession was thr subprime lending crisis.  Banks took these "rock solid" investments and created mortgage backed sercurites which they sold to themselves.  Then, they created Frankenstein investments known as credit default swaps that were tied to to the solvency of the MBS.  I shouldn't have to go on (maybe I do though).  Basically at every point in the chain there, they put a stop gap from that happening again, including and not limited to regulating credit agencies, tightening up borrowing requirements for a mortgage, regulating baks so they couldn't sell these mortgage backed securities to themselves, etc.  So yes, that would exactly prevent the housing crisis

The fed never bought mortgages.  Do you see any homes owned by the federal reserve?  Banks were making the bad mortgages and then selling them to themselves.  The mortgages did go belly up and a lot of people lost money.  The housing market crashed. I'm not sure what your talking about when you say the current owners of the titles didn't lose their money.  The market tanked!  It's since rebounded, but that's not because the fed has been buying houses. Many other reasons including low interest rates, strong economy, potentially inflated tech bubble, and international investors.

I think there were many factors of the recession, but the largest was due to mortgage defaults.  That's just borrowers not knowing any better, nothing to do with the fed.

You're ignoring the success of the US Financial system.  If I want to buy a car so I can drive to work, how could I afford an $18,000 vehicle if I just started working?  I get a loan from a bank so I can buy the car and get to work.  If I want to start a company, I get a loan and start a company.
These institutions don't exist in other parts of the world and they are worse off.  Look at water.org, which finances the installation of clean water in 3rd world countries so people don't have to walk 2 hours a day just to get water.  Instead, they can work for that time, eventually pay off the loan, and then have clean water.  Without financial institutions, we would be living in the stone ages!
Student loans, auto loans, stocks and bonds, all of these markets can drastically improve the status of living of any person as well as society as a whole.  With power comes responsibility, though.  If you borrow $100,000 to study English and can't get a job afterward, that's not the system's fault, that's your fault.

No!  Owning debt is opposite of owning the underlying asset.  Home buyers create demand.  The Fed is swapping out MBS with T-Bills, which is normal monetary policy and has nothing to do with the housing demand and everything to do with the solvency of the banks 
The Fed saved the American banking system by buying these MBS.  The bankers got away with murder (we can agree there), but we all would have been worse off if the Fed did not step in.  The American banking system would have crashed and the world would have been worse off.

Earlier you were describing the dangers of "predatory bubbles" in the economy.  I guess you are saying that the bubbles are entirely caused by the Fed.  Specifically, the Fed ALWAYS solves problems with low-interest rates?


That's simply not how the Fed works.  If you look back at 1979 and 1980, the federal funds rate reached a high of 20%, which was to combat inflation.  That's called contractionary polity.  They don't always lower interest rates. 
 In fact, they are starting to rise.  Let me know if that's too dense for you.
You keep bringing up bubbles and the threat they cause.  You seem to be associating them with the Federal Reserve entirely blaming them for causing bubbles.  You probably think that without the Fed we wouldn't have price bubbles, and Bitcoin fixes this problem.  What do you think happened last year when Bitcoin reach $20,000 and then since crashed?  Isn't that (gasp) a bubble?
The job of the federal reserve is to stabilize the economy.  It's not perfect, but it does a pretty damn good job.

The economies of other countries are not economic indicators of the US economy.


What is your source?

Mortgage backed security and mortgage are not the same.  You or I can't get a mortgage through the federal reserve.  Yes, you are correct when you say they own mortgage backed securities, but there are a completely different financial vehicle.
Yes, the market began to rebounded after the the fed bailed out the banks and auto industry, and that's something that I would argue made the great recession much more shallow than it could have been, which is a good thing globally.
Now they have lowered interests rates, which encourages bowworing, but they are still not issuing mortgages.

As long as the US economy is strong and stable, yes.  By betting against the dollar, you are essentially betting against the US economy.
