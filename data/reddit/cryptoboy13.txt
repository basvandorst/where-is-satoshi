Wow, this is huge news if true!

SuperNET isn't about NXT, it's much bigger and the inclusiveness will have positive benefits for BTC.

messiah?  milking for btc? Let's just stick to facts here.

James is probably one of the most visionary and gifted coders in crypto. He's recently been working with and having high level discussions with Tier Nolan, Greg Maxwell, and Anonymint.  The tech he has been coding is truly cutting edge and has the potential to help Bitcoin in a big way by helping to make BTC blockchain bloat a non-issue.

Ok, here's a better response: Look at his code. Speaks for itself.

BTC traders are fearing a drop because of recently added Ethereum to exchanges and taking refuge in USD

Yeah, it isn't completely optimized for mobile use yet.  We have a mobile solution in the pipeline ;)

Yeah, we're looking for feedback on where to set the rake.  We just set it at 10% because that seems to be the current standard.  Getting users is key though, so we will have to balance getting users with getting an appropriate return on the platform.

Bitcoin ETF will be a reality sometime this year

Banks...bwhahawa. Living Dinosaurs
@_date: 2018-07-28 02:37:13
they've really fallen hard
@_date: 2018-07-29 01:10:17
Looks like they just have BTC, LTC, ETH, and IOTA right now. I guess they just launched a few days ago.  Read on their steemit they'll be adding TrueUSD and Tether soon.  KYC, I'm not sure. I just had to fill out my profile and I could withdraw.
@_date: 2018-07-28 02:45:20
because it wasn't bad news. this was to be expected. a Bitcoin ETF will launch most likely in the Fall, almost certainly this year
@_date: 2018-07-29 02:03:02
ummm...I think I remember withdrawal fee being pretty standard. Pretty much the same as other exchanges. The trading fee was lower though, only 0.05%. They just need to get some more volume. They just opened, so probably will over time.

I just used lightning and put a little bit more on there.  Will place a couple orders. Gotta support people that are pushing lightning.
@_date: 2018-07-28 21:33:56
That seems to be the way they integrated it on this MercuriEX exchange.  Pretty neat, and pretty forward thinking.  Hope more exchanges do this or else this exchange takes off and gets some more volume.

Andreas keeping it real like always.  The real bitcoin Jesus ;)

Nice. Out of curiousity I actually tried a Lightning Deposit there yesterday with a small amount of Bitcoin to see how it works. Deposit showed up almost instantly.  Pretty neat.
This is the future imo.  With lightning deposits on exchanges you don't have to worry about the exchange getting hacked and stealing your coin.
@_date: 2018-07-28 05:31:16
hmmm...wonder why he would think that? Can't be that he has a vested interest...
@_date: 2018-07-28 02:40:50
I'm actually really excited about lightning. This is going to really be what allows Bitcoin to break into mainstream adoption.  Buying Coffee with bitcoin, no problemo.  Super fast!
@_date: 2018-07-28 05:33:30
Damn straight.  It feels so good to not have to go through an intermediary to access MY money.
@_date: 2015-04-07 10:50:06
China has High-end tech?
@_date: 2018-07-28 21:19:30
Well it's basically because you can store you btc on a lightning channel instead of on the exchange, allowing you to instantly take advantage of trade opportunities without having to wait for confirmations nor storing all your btc on the exchange.

Setup a btcc trading account and link your bank account (  You will have to go through their verification process.  If you can't link your bank account, you can try to buy vouchers with Alipay to fund your btcc trading account. All of this helps if you are fluent in mandarin or have a Chinese friend that you trust.

I highly doubt FanDuel or DraftKings will move to Bitcoin anytime soon and risk the wrath of the US government.  Both of those companies are centralized and would risk being shutdown if they allowed their customers to skirt the law.
