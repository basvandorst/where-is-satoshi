aka new tech has failed because its long winded and pointless
just accept it, ive used bitcoin cash to pay for things on multiple occasions within the last 2 months. to name a few:
paid a few friends for various things with it
an escort girl ive seen a few time
local bar manager now accepts it (cause i shilled him on it and he liked the sound of it)
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:23:59
Yeah the technology which isnt owned by "bitcoin" and therefore owning a bitcoin gives you no stake on the "technology"
Bitcoiners = Mongs

Ridin' on the city of new Orleans
Illinois central, monday mornin rail
15 Cars, and 15 restless drivers
3 conductors, and 24 sacks of mail.
All along the southbound oddysey, the train pulls out from kankakee. -And rolls along past houses farms and fields
And passing trains that have no name. And freight yards full of old black men, and the graveyards of the rusted automobiles.
GOOD MORNING, AMERICA HOW ARE YA?
I said dont you know me? I'm your native son. 
I'm the train they call, the city of new orleans. And I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done
