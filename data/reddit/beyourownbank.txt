Yeah, I'm actually unsure how a "nonce" might work to randomly select one block from a "blockpool" to append. In particular, this would have to be something global - which can be hard to agree on / synchronize.
Still, the network does manage to set lots of global values.
Maybe the "nonce" to "randomly" select the next block from the "blockpool" could be deterministically derived from the previous block itself. Just hash down the previous block to some number between 1 and 1,000,000 (using SHA plus a simple `mod` ie "modulus" or remainder operation). Even though the number wouldn't be random, at least it would throw a kind of monkey-wrench into the selection process: say the number is 567,126 - then all the nodes worldwide would be competing to have their block be the 567,126th block submitted.
Or maybe things could be scrambled up even further - if the random number to select the next block were derived from a hash of all the blocks in the current blockpool. That would be based on something created in *this* 10-minute interval - less known than something created in the *previous* 10-minute interval.
Hash all the blocks in the blockpool, do `mod` over 1,000,000 - then this gives a number, say 567,126 - and then use this number to select the "winning" block to append. (Doesn't even have to be the 567,126th block - it could be some other hash-based derivation, which uniquely lets a single block in the "blockpool" be the "winning" block to be appended).
The idea here is just just jumble things up a bit - to "destroy" any advantage of having a fast internet connection.
ie - if the problem is telcos refusing to provide fast internet in certain countries / jurisdictions - then Bitcoin should try to avoid requiring a fast internet connection.
We only need the block to get *uploaded* - ie broadcast[ed] to the network. We can algorithmically "loosen" the requirements around this broadcasting - instead of selecting the *first* block broadcasted, we deterministically, but unpredictably, select some *other* block broadcasted - using data which only came into existence recently.
I also understand the concern about attack surface area. I guess what I'm starting to realize though, is that *telcos can strangle Bitcoin* - simply by refusing to give people enough bandwidth. This is something telcos already love to do anyways. Some kind of "slownet" approach would allow Bitcoin to honey-badger its way around the telcos.

OK, maybe not a 10 minute submission period - but instead wait until 1000 candidate blocks have been received into the "blockpool" - and then pick one.
I don't understand what you're saying about double the electricity. It would still be the same computer with the same internet connection. Now instead of having just a mempool, it would also have a "blockpool". 
And to reduce the amount of additional RAM needed, the "blockpool" might not even have to contain the full *body* of each block - just some kind of *pointer* to the block.

This sounds very intriguing - although I must confess I've only merely heard of these words - I have no idea what they would all mean together.
Is there some source on this?

This is one of the most reasonable and convincing arguments I've read in the whole debate.
In particular, one of the factors which you identified seems extremely important, to maintain some kind of nature game-theory tendency on the part of miner to favor smaller blocks: the risk of being orphaned.

This article is about Bitcoin's main competitor (USD/Fed/JPM) going *down* - and for that reason, it *is* relevant to Bitcoin.

Russia needs better trolls!
This article is one of the most informative exposés ever written on how "economic hitmen" (and "jackals") actually do their work.
Judging by your grammar error (you omitted a certain indefinite article: "create [*an*] outside enemy") - and the way you needlessly veer off on an irrelevant and erroneous tangent (you gratuitously worried that this might leave the financial realm: what are you saying, that it would be wrong for banksters to suffer real-world consequences for their criminal actions, when normal citizens are already suffering??)  - one might conjecture that you work for a certain Russian troll factory. 
Economic hitmen are real - and they take down peripheral, resource-rich economies all the time. They are a vital instrument of national policy.
As the article itself states at the end:




Seriously, you need to learn how to troll better. The Agency should fire you.

VeraCrypt seems to be a good successor forked from TrueCrypt.
If enough people simply download and use various kinds of encryption software, then the decision of the Apples and Googles and Microsofts of the world whether to comply or not to comply with ridiculous USGov demands will be irrelevant.
Encryption exists, secrets exist. There is no way for any government to stomp them out.

Technically, wouldn't it be "a grand for 35 cents" ?

Here are two basic facts which more and more people are becoming aware of:
(1) The various numbers typically bandied around for the various measures of total amount of currency / wealth in the world tend to be in the range of **"tens of trillions"** (of some currency unit - eg USDollars).
(2) We have this proposed new currency unit called Bits, where the maximum total number of units which will ever be issued is *also* in the range of **"tens of trillions"** - in this case, 21 trillion Bits (where 1 million Bits equals one Bitcoin).
Anyone who is aware of those two facts (and who also happens to have an extra 350 USDollars lying around now) might think:


Spending 350 USDollars to become a Bit-Millionaire in a new currency which is guaranteed to only have a maximum issuance of 21 trillion Bits (**if** it actually ends up succeeding as a currency) would be really life-changing for most people. 
Admittedly, spending $3.50 to get 10 000 Bits could also be somewhat life-changing too - for anyone who's so poor that all they can afford right now is $3.50.
Some people throw away 350 USDollars on lottery tickets or lattes each year - or $3.50 in a single day. They might be very motivated to make this kind of potentially life-changing speculative investment, if they're aware of these facts:
- only 21 trillion Bits will ever be issued
- most currencies have a total supply in the range of **"tens of trillions"** of units
- (and if the transactional capacity of the Bitcoin network is increased and if Bitcoin wallets become easier and safer to use)
- (and if other currencies continue devalue due to things like Quantitative Easing, negative interest rates, etc.)
... then at some point nobody is gonna feel they can afford *not* to take a bet on acquiring some Bits.
And many people will look back to the days when you could become a Bit-Millionaire for less than 350 USDollars.

Whoosh ! 
Who piss in this troll's Cheerio's today ?
There *was* some glitch way back in the day where briefly a bunch of extra Bitcoins "existed" on the Blockchain - but everyone knows it was quickly fixed !
Interesting... First comment in this thread is from a troll.
Originally, trolls used to hang out under *bridges* trying to troll people.
Now they evidently hang out on *subreddits* sorted by "New" and try to immediately troll every single new thread as soon as it's posted.
I guess this troll must be pretty unsure of its arguments if it feels the need to shoot them out that quickly.

I think you're missing the part of the argument where it points out that many currencies today have a "money supply" in the range of **"tens of trillions"**.
So, when talking about the "money supply" of a new currency, it can be helpful (in terms of people's psychological understanding of magnitudes in economics) to pick a unit such that the total "money supply" for this new currency is again in this range of **"tens of trillions"**.
The simplest way to do this is to prefer to talk at the level of Bits - where 1 million Bits equals one Bitcoin - because this gives a total "money supply" of 21 trillion Bits (which is equal to 21 million Bitcoins).
**No** globally useful currency has only a few "tens of **million**" units - they all have a few "tens of **trillion**" units.
A **trillion** is a **million million.** 
For some random reason this kinda reminds me of a classic New Yorker cartoon, featuring a banker sitting at his desk saying into the telephone: 


So, carefully picking the level of scale of our units to result in numbers within the range of the total "money supply" of a typical currency (such as the USDollar), we could make the following statements:
- Most currencies have a total "money supply" measured in **"tens of trillions"** of units.
- There will only be a maximum of 21 trillion Bits in the total "money supply" of the Bitcoin currency.
- 1 million Bits currently costs less than 350 USDollars.
So in some psychological sense, this gives a rough estimate for how much a person might invest if they wanted to speculate on becoming a "millionaire" in this new currency - ie, if they wanted to control a "million" units of a currency whose total "money supply" is measured in the "tens of trillions" of units, such as most currencies are today.
So, at current prices, it only costs 350 USDollars to become a future "millionaire" in this currency.
Again, the only way the mathematics and economics (and psychology) works out in familiar, suggestive terms like this is if you use "Bits" (and not "Bitcoins") to denominate the total "money supply".
Using "Bits" (not "Bitcoins") is the only way to get a total "money supply" measured in the ranges of "tens of trillions" of units (Bits), as most currencies are today.
**TL;DR: Total "money supply" is traditionally and most easily discussed using "tens of *trillions* of units" (eg: 21 *trillion* Bits) - not "tens of *millions* of units" (21 *million* Bitcoins).**

I've been noticing your comments over the past few weeks, trying to decide if you're either a kinda smart contrarian or just a clueless troll.
This post of yours nailed it: you're just a clueless troll. 
This comment of yours tries to make five simple claims - and each one of them is completely idiotic and easily rebutted - as shown in the 5-point response from Logical007.
And then your counter-response is breathtakingly rude and childish and laden with profanities - and also devoid of content.
So thanks for clearing that up for me: now I know you're just a clueless troll.

Weird loophole: The 1,000 EUR limit only applies to French citizens.
Foreigners have a higher limit: 10,000 EUR.

What transactions does France specifically mean here?
Purchases from *whom*? / Payments to *whom*?
For example: Say someone wants to privately sell a used computer for over 1,000 EUR - then they can't accept cash?
How could this possibly be enforced?
I looked up some other sources on Google News (France) to try to find more precise wording, but it only talked about "achats" (purchases) and "paiements" (payments) - without specifying *who* was involved.
