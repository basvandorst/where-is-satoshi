Yes because the mempool is only going to increase in back logged transactions.

Hahaha now you're just nitpicking the semantics of what I said.
They are in fact the same thing.

Take a look at the extended mempool data. 
From May through June 2017, the mempool had over 100k CONSTANTLY. Since then it has peaked at over 100k multiple times. And you are ignoring my point about transactions being slow and fees always being high.

That's hilarious. Right now the BTC mempool has 115,000+ unconfirmed transactions and climbing. BCH transactions are almost always instant and free of cost. It has been like this for quite some time now. BCH currently handling $6 billion in 24 hours without any backing up in the mempool.

I see you are not at all interested in having an intellectually honest debate about Bitcoin Cash &amp; Bitcoin. Not only is your response in bad faith, you did not make a single coherent or valid counter-argument. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:01:15
I don't make emotional financial decisions, sorry to bust your bubble. 
The conclusions I have made about Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are from critical thinking. 
You didn't address any of my points at all. None of what I said is propaganda.
Roger Ver is not defrauding anyone. In the real world you could be sued for libel for making such claims.

Far less centralized than Blockstream.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:09:51
I said the mempool has "*near*-constant" 100,000+ unconfirmed transactions. Not constant, but it happens all the time. This is why transactions are always high in fees, and always slow to process.

The EDA was temporary. It is being fixed in the upcoming hard fork on November, 13th.

Bitcoin may have been the original crypto but it has failed to live up to expectations. The true scam is being forced to pay massive transaction fees just to get your payments through, often with a waiting period of several hours. Other currencies are fast and don't have fees. The market will decide which they prefer. I am willing to bet that usability, liquidity, and efficiency are going to be important factors moving forward. As of now, BTC no longer has any of those qualities.

Segwit 1x is centralization then. Every upgrade to Bitcoin is centralization by this logic.

"BTC" aka Blockstreamcoin or S1Xcoin
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:38:16
1. Bitcoin shot itself in the foot by ignoring high transaction fees, long transaction waiting periods, and the near-constant 100,000+ unconfirmed transactions in the mempool.
2. Bitcoin Cash is a digital peer to peer currency. Which is the intended goal as stated by the Satoshi white paper. In fact, everything the Satoshi white paper proclaimed Bitcoin to be is what Bitcoin Cash is today. 
3. Bitcoin Cash is not an "altcoin" just because you are a BTC-Maximalist.
4. If you're feeling pissed off, then you understand how the Bitcoin Cash crowd has felt for so long. The complacency and incompetence from Core devs &amp; Blockstream are the reason why all of this is happening. Bitcoin is losing market dominance because it is an obsolete and inferior product.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:08:27
There is nothing untrue about what I said. You just seem really bitter that not everyone wants to follow in line and be a BTC maximalist. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:16:55
How was S2X centralized when almost all miners supported it?
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:39:07
Just like some central authority called off the S2X fork even though it had a majority miner support?

Lol enjoy your absurdly high transaction fees, molasses slow transaction speeds, and constantly bloated mempool. Blockstream has intentionally crippled Bitcoin. Bitcoin will be looked back on as the MySpace of cryptocurrency. Unwilling to change when necessary, and the competitors are eating it alive.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:50:41
Blockstream will be centralizing BTC with their patented sidechains. They profit from high transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:10:48
Lol yes they did. And you fucking know it. The entire purpose of BTC was meant to replace fiat as a system of everyday payment. One of Bitcoin's main selling points used to be "No fees to send money anywhere in the world!" "We're gonna save the World's unbanked whom make less than $2 a day!". Neither of these are feasible anymore. You're just moving the goalposts now by saying BTC isn't meant to be used like an everyday currency.
