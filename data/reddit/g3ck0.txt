Because it potentially still has a long way to go.

Well the more energy you use, the less environmentally friendly you are.

That's a good way to lose money. It's gonna keep dropping for a while yet.

Bitcoin is basically worthless as a currency right now, so this won't have the impact you think.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:30:18
So what is it? An investment with no real worth?
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:31:10
Why would I buy things with bitcoin over my local currency?

Honestly, I'm not sure when I need it. It says it ends on the 25th, but I have no idea which timezone that is. Just to be safe I want it done tonight, but I might be able to get it done tomorrow (Sunday), the problem is banks are still closed Sunday.

Unfortunately not. Brisbane.

Sure, but people talk about Bitcoin like it's this amazing thing that will replace banks? If it's not even as fast as banks normally, how could it replace them?

Every transaction is in Australia, and we're so behind wouldn't every country be the same?
@_date: 2019-04-01 08:08:14
That seems annoying. Money is better than because it is instant?
@_date: 2019-04-01 08:36:24
No real issue, but being able to instantly transfer money to friends/family is nice, so I thought Bitcoin would be the same.
@_date: 2019-04-01 09:55:27
Doesn’t matter when I can instantly spend it.

Most people don't want bitcoin to spend though, it's just an extra step. And spending it means you have less to save in the hope you somehow make lots of money from it.
