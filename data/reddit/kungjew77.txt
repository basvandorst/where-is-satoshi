That's very kind of you to let her read something.

If you are planning to ignore this subreddit then why would you make a post here? Seems contrary to this "peace of mind" you seek and exactly what you are trying to do. Am I missing something?

Oh, I see. You're not actually ignoring the subreddit, just letting other people know they can think about doing it too. Very kind of you to clear it all up for me.

Why did you invest if you didn't know what to do with it?

What does it tell you?

 I'm looking into something like this right now. My understanding is the "checkbook" self-directed Roth IRA actually creates an LLC which you then purchase assets under. Is this what you meant when you mentioned opening a bank account in your IRA's (LLC) name?
By transferring your assets to BF is it effectively a rollover from an existing retirement fund? If so, and forgive my ignorance, are you taxed on those assets just as part of your annual tax return or at the time of conversion (assuming 401k to Roth IRA)?
I'm looking for an article I found a while ago that outlines the process and also points out some caveats to keep in mind to avoid problems with this approach. I'll update when I find it.
