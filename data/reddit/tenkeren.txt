This gives confidence. Is there also some kind of 3rd-party backup that is activated if both of you two owners should (God forbid) decease in an accident? I assume you don't fly separate planes, like the president ;-)

It's partly because of this news:
[China’s Temporary QR Code Ban Could Have Implications for Bitcoin’s Future](
China is a big player in Bitcoin now, and was the driving force of the extreme rise of value in December.

These methods are already available in the [libbitcoin c++ library.](
Use the brain-wallet passphrase as the seed, generate the private key, and then the public address from that.
Some example code to generate the seed and keys: look at the [sx command line interface]( and [c++ source code]( in the files "mnemonic.cpp", "genpriv.cpp" and "addr.cpp".

Your intention is heartwarming. But this job is already being done by the proviolent hacking networks that have far more computing power than your benevolent network would gain. Why? Money my friend, money.
They sweep the entire balance, not just a "warning shot". And they reach the wallet before you do.

Did you try un-stemmed words as well? E.g. bitcoiner, bitcoins etc, in addition to the stem bitcoin. There are a lot more variations that way.
But still, I agree that OP spending parts of the bounty is not a good sign.

Great work! Thanks. It clarifies thought.

Great, congratulations! But customer security has been an issue in the Bitcoin community after MtGox fail - so do you keep the Fiats in separate customer accounts (maybe Norwegian law requires this)? And how much of customer BTC could be lost, in worst case, following the unlikely event of a successful attack?

**OP: We are ready for another hint!**
@_date: 2014-03-07 15:59:28
Are you sure? I have not seen anyone reporting that they have run through all un-stemmed words as well (e.g. "bitcoining" "bitcoiner", "mtgoxed" etc, in additoin to the stems "bitcoin" "mtgox" etc).

I got the 300, and the 75/1200

For two reasons
* A bitcoin address is not like an account that has a balance. It consists of outputs from previous transactions, in this case an output of 5  BTC and another of 1 BTC. At blockchain.info or other sites you can see the total of these, which is 6 BTC. But this is just the sum of the outputs, shown for convenience. The amount 6 BTC is not stored itself in the blockchain, only the outputs.
* An entire output has to be spent in a transaction. If you send a part of it to an address, you must send the rest to another. For convenience, this could be sent back to the same (spending) address.
If you are sending a bigger amount, several outputs can be spent.
