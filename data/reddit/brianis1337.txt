Agreed. Many people forget that 10 cents in America is basically negligible, however in many parts of the world this is a pretty hefty fee to transact every day.

There's other ways to expand adoption other then using it. Most of us here don't use crypto as a day to day currency because it's so volitle. Why should we spend our crypto when we know it's gonna increase instead of Fiat, which constantly decreases in value?

Do you actually use Bitcoin on a day to day basis with these insanely high fees and long confirmation times, when there's dozens of new coins that have sub-cent fees and faster confirmation times? Hell, there's even DAG coins that boast instant confirmation times with zero fees. Why would anyone use bitcoin in this case?

More pools=smaller control of the Bitcoin network=better decentralization

Burstcoin tried to accomplish that with a Proof of capacity; didn't turn out good as the network was attacked around July and now it's basically dead

There was a paper on it explaining it

Hey it's me your long lost brother
In all seriousness I hope you retrieve your keys and bitcoins! It looks like you could use the money considering your situation right now

Bitcoin mining is pretty hard to break even unless you have alot of money.
 You could either:
1:Buy Bitcoin outright and hope for it to rise.
2:Dabble in gpu mining (some coins only allow gpus to mine the coin allowing for more decentralization) and break even in 6-12 months.
3:Invest in POS coins/masternodes and get a 3-10% yearly return on coins depending on the coin.
