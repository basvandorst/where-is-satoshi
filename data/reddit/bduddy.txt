Using a specific grade of oil is not that important. Most oil changes grades based on temperature anyway.

The point = to increase the value of the mods' Bitcoin holdings?

Yeah... the default-subreddit mods are just terrible moderators. The mods of (everyone that posts there, really) are actually terrible people.

Apple doesn't need an excuse. They can do whatever they want, and what they want is not to allow Bitcoin wallets.

That's untrue. You have to pay tax on any amount, but the company does not have to report it to you or the IRS unless you win a certain amount ($600 in most cases, I believe).
In practice, the IRS probably expects that very few people will report their winnings under that amount.

The IRS also says that you have to report your drug trafficking income and any bribes paid, so they can be properly dealt with. They won't arrest you for reporting them; they'll only arrest you for not reporting them.
What I'm trying to say is, the IRS is a bit different.

Doesn't seem much different from this subreddit!

It's like whenever there's a study about marijuana.

This is about as valid a legal argument as "I signed it with my non-dominant hand, so it doesn't count!"
Which book used that... the first Series of Unfortunate Events, I think?
