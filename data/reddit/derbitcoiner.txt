So what would the solution be? Prohibit fiat to BTC transfers and only allow miners to have BTC? Even if they did people would sell BTC for fiat on black markets. Sad truth, Fiat can buy anything. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 17:56:14
much obliged :)
@_date: 2014-05-24 03:38:56
No they don't. Banks do not require proof of origin for every dollar you deposit. The only time you have to explain where the cash you are depositing came from is in a cash transaction report when it exceeds $10,000 in a single day.  Don't get me wrong I'm pro bitcoin and anti-bank, and bitstamp is imposing restrictions above and beyond what banks do making them worse in my opinion. 
@_date: 2014-06-06 17:50:11
So I can buy $20 worth of BTC and withdraw it immediately? Or are there minimum  bet/cashout requirements after I purchase my BTC through Bitstars before I can send it elsewhere?
@_date: 2014-05-07 19:21:39
I've thought of the same thing but what if I stick it on a traffic sign or on my car bumper, it will be super difficult for someone to scan it unless both are still. 
Someone should create a short url service sorta thing that takes you to their BTC address like bitsend.to/ryan84 or tinybtc.com/supportcancer or whatever the host name is. That way I can drive by it and remember it with ease and I can donate later.

I could still go back on it, because I kind of feel like I "lost" to his sales pitch... Why was he hard selling this to me? Does he get some kind of bonus for each upgrade? Why does WF want me to upgrade?
* You should. Yes he does get commission on accounts upgrades. I worked for WaMu and we received bonuses and commission on every account upgrade. The banks really want to make you feel like they are offering you a great service, when in fact they are just taking your money. I can't remember exactly but fees accounted for around 40-50% of the banks income. Need a print out of your account ledger? $6 fee? Need a cashiers check? $9 fee. Did you overdraft by only $2? $30 overdraft fee.

No those dollars traded are used to buy BTC. If someone sells 5 BTC, the exchange isn't paying for it, a buyer is. If someone buys 5 BTC, the exchange is getting that money the seller is.  That's what an exchange does, it simply facilitates the exchange, it doesn't provide fiat or BTC. I don't understand where you expect to get this mountain of fiat from.

You would have a large surplus of BTC on hand. Otherwise you have to liquidate your customer's BTC deposits, turn it into fiat and when they withdraw you would have to re-buy BTC to send back to them. 
Even if you have a ton of BTC you would make way more than 1.6% just buy holding the BTC.

The thing is the general public can use facebook more or less safely (other than clicking a banner link and then another and another until they get malware).

First you need to decide on a wallet. Leather, velcro, etc.
Many people put their fiat in 3rd party financial institutions called banks, and others be their own bank and store their fiat in underwear drawers, safes and other cool places. Fiat is a great investment though it's not backed by math or complex algorithms it can only be copied if you have a really really good color copier. Lastly as opposed to bitcoin the CEO of fiat Bernakama hasn't killed himself or filed bankruptcy. Buy fiat!

Q: How many bitcoiners does it take to change a lightbulb ?
A: Three. One to change the bulb. One to speculate the time it will take to change based on charts from the previous year. One to make an online bet whether or not it will break.
I don't have an answer for the banker one.

You're likely going to lose money in energy and equipment costs.  Even mining alts with high end GPU's are hardly worth it, unless you get lucky and mine a ton of a brand new alt coin that later shoots to the moon.

I think everyone should hodl SOME away for later.
I also think you shouldn't have to make the choice between having BTC vs feeding yourself. Feed yourself!! What can a homeless man do with 2 BTC?
