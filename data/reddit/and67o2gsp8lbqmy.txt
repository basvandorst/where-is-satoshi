**So brave** coming into a place with over 100k people that will likely agree with you.
@_date: 2014-02-07 14:56:29
[Read my comment history]( and you'll see that we're on the same side here.
@_date: 2014-02-09 17:46:48


No, I didn't. You made assumptions based on two statements that contained no specifics whatsoever.


[How in the flying *fuck* did you miss this?]( It was everywhere in the threads if you got past the circlejerk bullshit comments at the top.


"Raise hell" in this case means screaming in an echo chamber, making a couple meaningless gestures that just solidifies the already fanatic base, and *absolutely nothing about the situation changing*. Dragging net neutrality into this (an issue you clearly don't actually understand but read about on reddit that day they blacked out the site) "discussion" you think you're fostering is also completely pointless.
Enjoy hanging out with the children. Looks like I'll hit my sell target this afternoon or this evening. My involvement with the community is over.
@_date: 2014-02-07 18:01:46
It's not threadcrapping. It's someone disagreeing with your stance. If you expelled everyone that disagreed with your stance from a place, well, it wouldn't be very fun anymore.
has devolved into this chimeric mass of bullshit over the last 36 hours. Shooting (in the literal sense, not the Instagram sense) your perfectly good phones to send a message, working yourselves up into a fury about Apple removing an application for violating their policies, and now some no-name retailer in Australia posts a "press release" on some spamtastic website... and we shower with praise? Many of us in the BTC community and on do not like what we're seeing.


There are *tons* of ways to have a BTC wallet on your phone that don't involve a native application. Also, no one is forcing you to use Apple's products. They're a company; vote with your wallet. There's no need to endlessly tirade against a company for the stance they've chosen just because you disagree with it. They aren't a government and don't have any kind of real power over what you do with your time, effort, and money.


At no point did say he saw no value in it, period. It's not something he needs. Simple as that. I have no need for it but I see the value in it. See how those can be different things?


It turns out, there are tons of phones that "have it" that aren't the iPhone. Make another choice.
@_date: 2014-02-07 12:37:56
Because is deep in the weeds of this circlejerk and *nothing* will stand in the way. For fuck's sake, yesterday morning someone *was paying people to shoot their iPhones*. You really expect calm, rational responses from the BTC community? Every time something goes slightly wrong, all we hear is crying.
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:19:41
Not sure exactly which bit you're asking about, so I'll address both.
* frequently devolves into an anti-Apple circlejerk any time Apple doesn't follow the exact specifications that no one actually knows of the discerning userbase of that subreddit. Essentially, Apple is Satan and no amount of anything ever can change that for the typical poster of The perils of being a default sub, I guess.
* I'm saddened this is in for a lot of reasons. The needless destruction of consumable materials is beyond silly. Especially when the devices are perfectly functioning, still! It does nothing but foment more contempt for Apple. Believe it or not, Apple's actions will do plenty in that arena. We don't need some random user acting in the name of Bitcoin (face it, that's *exactly* what is going on here) in the heat of the moment. It makes our community look like a bunch of immature crybabies that can't handle when something they want doesn't turn out how they would like.
We're better than this. How about instead, we encourage disillusioned iOS device owners to [donate their device to US veterans]( or [donate their device to victims of domestic abuse]( or [find a local donation point near you]( Non-American users can likely find their own donation point by some simple searching. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:57:55
Oh boy, more childish antics! Surely this is what the community needed to get us over the credibility hump! /s
@_date: 2014-02-07 12:50:09


I like how his one-line Twitter bio that he probably hasn't updated in forever says this to you.
@_date: 2014-02-07 20:31:01
I like how I've now twice been called a shitposter/threadshitter for disagreeing with the prevailing opinion.
Great subreddit we've got here.
@_date: 2014-02-06 17:49:47


Unfortunately, very few people seem to realize this.
@_date: 2014-02-07 12:44:52
*Holy shit you people are fucking children*
@_date: 2014-02-07 12:42:03
Yeah! That'll show Apple!
@_date: 2014-02-07 03:50:17
Yes, it's possible a mistake was made. In this case, it's extremely doubtful. It's also very rare that I see an account thought to be shadowbanned listed as deleted/non-existant.
@_date: 2014-02-07 12:38:19
They'll keep bringing in boatloads of cash. That's their move.
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:29:28
Disagree. This current overreaction is directly related to blockchain.info's removal. The moaning, complaining, kvetching, and outright *whining* was tolerable until this.
@_date: 2014-02-07 12:38:55
You can't. The OP is using followers. Which if you follow social networking at all, is a gigantic pile of bullshit to call these "views".
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:56:30
Your points might be valid (even though I'm sure the terms and conditions blockchain.info agreed to when they submitted the app basically allow Apple to do this) but "hey everyone, destroy your iPhones!" is the *wrong* message our community should be sending. It's absurd, childish, and does nothing to further BTC's credibility.
@_date: 2014-02-06 17:50:37
@_date: 2014-02-06 17:51:56
Barely a godamned thing.
Apple removed blockchain.info's app from their App Store. is reacting like a bunch of spoiled children.
@_date: 2014-02-09 08:50:41
"Buy low, sell high."
Boy, such insight.
@_date: 2014-02-11 12:13:31
**SO BRAVE**
@_date: 2014-02-07 17:15:52
Nope, fuck yourself. This circlejerk don't need no proof and is a strong, independent black woman.
@_date: 2014-02-08 16:37:25
That's not what I said at all. The visceral, childish reaction to the removal of blockchain.info's app is what is making me rethink my involvement with the community.
I simply bought BTC low after the MtGox incident. Once the price rebounds, I'll sell off back into currency and be done with my involvement with BTC. It was a simple speculation investment.
@_date: 2014-02-08 16:35:02


\[citation needed\] other than the original thread where a guy was paying people to destroy their iPhones. Video documented proof.


\[citation needed\] on the second shop. I'm aware of the no-name, practically non-existent sales shop in Australia that pumped out a PRWire/SpamWire story about it. I may have missed the second one admittedly, because I'm finding myself coming to less and less.


The ill informed witch hunting that this subreddit has engaged in demonstrates nothing.
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:58:41
You get banned for violating reddit's terms and conditions, which his original post clearly did. Although I'm not 100% sure that he was shadowbanned. I've a number of shadowbanned accounts (such is the life of using a popular VPN service) and *each* show up in [this tool]( as "Shadowbanned user". User "round-peg" shows up as deleted or non-existent. I'm not saying he deleted his account but it sent up a red flag for me. You can find a little more about shadowbans [in this subreddit]( The process is largely opaque and final.
@_date: 2014-02-07 12:40:19
How many times can you make the same flippant remark in this thread? So far, it's two!
@_date: 2014-02-07 14:57:54
So, any proof here or are we just circlejerking this one into truth?
@_date: 2014-02-09 18:01:08


Just what do you think "take banks out" means? You think they'll just lose a vast majority of their revenue and keep on trucking?


Car companies? Dude, can you keep up a simple line of argument for more than a sentence? This is the second post in a row from you that just walks the fuck off the point mid-stream. I think you're running out of ways to defend your point.


See my link in the other post. You should probably do some [rudimentary research]( about the App Store, the restrictions developers have when using *their* ecosystem, and the consequences for violating those conditions the developers agree to when they submit an application for listing.
The entire BTC community has broken down into an angry little mob. They're acting like toddlers on a massive level. It's not just but it's spread everywhere I look. I'm realizing that BTC is about already rich people playing with an imaginary currency. They react like a bunch of spoiled teenagers when something doesn't go *exactly* their way.
Feel free to reply, but I'm moving on to my next throwaway. There is literally nothing left for me here.
@_date: 2014-02-11 13:26:31
I like how you're just spamming replies at me. I can hear you banging away at your keyboard. Such anger, much immaturity, wow.
@_date: 2014-02-07 12:41:49


Let me fix that for you.


@_date: 2014-02-07 20:33:32


Please, tell me again how shooting a phone *that was already purchased* is voting with your dollars.
If my choice is between being "an Apple fanboy" or "a Bitcoin advocate" (HINT: not everything is black and white), I'll go ahead and choose the former because the latter are acting like a bunch of spoiled children.
@_date: 2014-02-07 20:32:26
To me, disagreeing with someone isn't shit-anything or crap-anything or whatever the hell else term you want to invent to quash dissent.
People have an opinion on this. Sorry but you're going to have to be an adult and deal with people not agreeing with you. If you didn't want to hear differing opinions, you shouldn't be giving your own in an open forum designed to illicit responses from all comers.
@_date: 2014-02-07 15:29:31


isn't the same as


I expect better from you. This just looks like you're screaming into the echo chamber.
@_date: 2014-02-09 08:52:14


Thanks for that incredibly legitimate source! I really appreciate the 0.02 seconds you took to research this on your own before barfing onto @_date: 2014-02-07 15:30:50
The last 24-48 hours have truly made me rethink my involvement in the community. I bought into the MtGox price drop and when the price comes back up, I'll likely liquidate back into USD or EUR.
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:46:09
I thought Really saddened when I saw it was :(
@_date: 2014-02-07 18:07:45
That's not compromise, that's being factually accurate. Saying "a lot" implies *more than fucking 5*.
@_date: 2014-02-06 17:46:38
*Except he was fucking manipulating votes*. Just because it doesn't bother you doesn't mean it's not a clear and flagrant violation of the rules.
@_date: 2014-02-09 08:53:36
How has never working in any meaningful software development worked out for you?
@_date: 2014-02-07 12:45:40
Hey, could you fuck off with your logic? I'm trying to circlejerk over here!
@_date: 2014-02-09 08:48:32


This is probably an extreme definition. My *belief* here is that the majority of the BTC community (which is more than sees it as an alternative currency, not something that will topple existing currencies. This particular debate however is subjective at best, and navel gazing at worst. Most of the community right now is aligned on the "spread the word" part of something like this movement.


My mention of *one* transaction/move I've made is **not** an indicator of my intentions with BTC, let alone enough to generalize anyone's behavior.
You really need to stop viewing everything as black and white. Stop assuming and ask questions instead of simply going "you're either with us, or against us". You aren't doing yourself or the community any favors by jumping to extremes every time someone disagrees with your *belief* (seeing a theme?) about what BTC is, what the community is, and where both are headed in both the short and long term.
@_date: 2014-02-07 12:30:52
You see that user page if they're shadowbanned, deleted, or never existed. Did you even [check the tool I posted]( before replying in the first place?
Source: Multiple shadowbanned accounts, no deleted accounts, you can't really check this source anyway and I can't check your source either
@_date: 2014-02-11 13:34:07
This is just getting hilarious now. Please, keep railing against me! Don't forget to load up your unread message page and pound refresh! Don't want to let me get away for too long, **I'm insane remember?** I have to be called out for the obvious corporate shill I am!
Another suggested subreddit: because everyone is working against you, man!
@_date: 2014-02-07 12:51:24
Yeah, clearly MtGox has all the resources of Facebook.
Sorry, didn't mean to step on your circlejerk :(
@_date: 2014-02-08 16:38:19
I have never stored BTC at MtGox.
Hey, fuck proof right? Let's just assume that some guy telling a story is 100% accurate. Quit being gullible. Asking for proof here is not a burden. Surely the OP has pictures or video of his protest.
@_date: 2014-02-09 08:52:54

"You disagree with me, you must be a paid entity!"
You're doing a bangup job of showing the community's immaturity. You might like as well. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 14:58:48
He can tell the story as many times as he likes. Without proof, I've got a very hard time believing this.
