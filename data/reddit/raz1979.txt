I appreciate the response. After I left the comment, it really got me thinking... i mean nothing can come from nothing.

I thought the whole purpose of tether was just to avoid selling into fiat. So it’s a holder to avoid taxes (under 2017 like securities) so who cares if it’s backed by usd. Just don’t allow cashing out in tether. Isn’t it suppose to just be a parking lot for crypto?

did you just ask me what the point of "this" was on a reddit thread? What's the point of any of this? I'm writing a fantasy novel and wanted to do some research. The cover has Fabio on it with the Bitcoin logo emblazoned on his chest.

Turns out Coinbase added BCash and people are likely going from one to the other.

I have been going in and out and regretting every time but feel stuck doing it. I think I'm adverse to the eventual "correction" that might occur after segwit. 
I once had .45 bitcoin when it was $1200 a bitcoin... now nothing because I sold and got back in at different intervals.

I bought $50 worth when it was $400 a bitcoin and saw a year and a half later it was worth $150 ($1200 a bitcoin). I totally forgot I bought some and checked in on it. Didn't have the foresight to buy more thinking $1200 was too expensive for something I didn't grasp then, which was about 2015.

I've put a reminder in my phone to check this on May 23, 2018 to see if the price of bitcoin is $10,023 and if it's not I'll eat a McAfee dick cake.
