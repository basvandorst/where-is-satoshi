Well you can withdraw it trough a bridge, or you can just "settle" the amount of fiat you have for the equivalent amount in bts.

Surbitcoin.com ... bolivares for bitcoin exchange
@_date: 2015-06-10 12:51:01


there are plenty of places to buy, the guy was just talking nonsense lol
@_date: 2017-02-06 23:26:50
Well yes when I said "bitcoin is the new dollar" I didnt mean for you to take it literally. However since buying dollars is ILLEGAL there is no actual numbers of what the daily trade is, so no way to know for sure which one has more volume amongst regular people.
BTW I dont mind you disagreeing with me, but calling me a fake account? hehe
@_date: 2017-02-13 02:07:17
ok, then why do you think I am getting this error on an unsync wallet:
"Invalid private key encoding (code -5)"
@_date: 2017-02-13 02:15:13
ok, do you know how or where I can change from one format to another?

Gas is like 50 cents the tank, I would deff buy a generator
@_date: 2017-02-06 19:43:14
Boom, bitcoin is the new dollar in Venezuela.. I know this because I am venezuelan.. people get paid and turn their wage into bitcoin as fast as they can!
@_date: 2016-03-02 02:30:29
Bravo!.. banks are a pain I try not to go ever!! And what I hate the most is how they charge me like 2 dollars per month for having an account, 5 for just having a debit card.. 2 for withdrawing on atm.. etc.. etc.. 
@_date: 2017-02-01 21:59:46
If segwit activates on LTC, will there be an electrum LTC update?
@_date: 2016-03-02 03:56:29
Haha yes...yes it does.. I think btc has a lot more potential in developing countries actually, it solves more problems lol
@_date: 2017-02-07 12:50:36
mmm because you need to eat perhaps?
@_date: 2017-02-06 21:33:39
hehe yes I have a real account... didnt think my comment will get such attention.
It is hard to get dollars too, it is actually ilegal you cant get them from banks or any financial institution... you need to either find some1 who has dollars cash and hide them in your house or you need to have an international bank account and ask for a wire transfer from some1 who also has an foreign bank account.
If you wish to buy bitcoin you just go to localbitcoins or the facebook group and buy it.
It is true, believe it or not. I am venezuelan, I have a 2 yrd old account with lots of karma and I do speak spanish haha... I am real man wtf! lol
@_date: 2017-02-13 12:33:23
In Venezuela fuel is almost free too, why don´t you buy a diesel generator and use it mine?
I am not sure if that will give you the stability you need, but you wont be "stealing" subsidized electricity that way.
P.S: Comprate un generador de diesel o de gasolina y metele con eso?
@_date: 2017-02-13 12:31:49
yeap and if they get cought, you would be responsible for putting your friends and family in jail too lol
@_date: 2016-03-19 12:51:50
Bitcoin and Ethereum facebook groups on Venezuela went secret and I think miners may think twice about buying mining equipment there.... the problem wasnt bitcoin at first, they cant stop people from trading p2p, the problem is mining as there are some big farms there that contribute to the power shortage... i even saw a video once of a huge farm in Caracas and a guy happily smiling to the camara 
@_date: 2016-03-08 15:19:19
I would say very reliable, I have been trading at poloniex for a while and there are no fake walls there
@_date: 2016-03-02 03:47:47
Really you dont even have fees for getting a new debit card?.. the only bank where i dont get charged is the one I have my salary on.. the rest are crap.. well I do live in Argentina where any loan rate is like 58% interest :( .. so you can expect banks to rip you off here..  I just buy bitcoin and hold.. it always ends up going up. 
@_date: 2016-01-19 12:16:30
yeap, got it twice from two different accounts, someone is really interested in pumping eth!
@_date: 2017-01-25 13:30:41
mmm I see the overall volume crash but trading is still dominated by okcoin, huobi and btcchina... those three colors are still like 90% of all trading.. am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-01-12 12:34:16
hehe you bitcoin nazi!... what a Bear your friend is eh?
@_date: 2017-01-25 14:30:13


Why not?... you could use litecoin, monero, eth or use steem that has no fees at all
If the transaction fees of bitcoin keep rising its gonna become like a premium storage of value, like gold and it will give way for other cryptocurrencies that can be used for micro-transactions.
@_date: 2017-01-04 01:24:43
100.000 LTC is a lot money and they used to be worth a lot more back when he opened it up, thats for sure lol
@_date: 2017-01-25 22:57:03
- Venezuelan Authorities: What is this? you mining bitcoins?
- No Sir, these "Aintminers"
@_date: 2017-01-31 13:26:01
@_date: 2017-01-25 13:59:07
Ok, last bar is way too small, so I went to coinmarketcap and found that China still has the most volume but they clearly do not dominate the market like before:
* OKCoin.cn	BTC/CNY $12,675,100 ------&gt; CHINA
* Huobi	BTC/CNY $12,156,800 ------&gt; CHINA
* Bitfinex	BTC/USD $11,775,700
* BTCC	BTC/CNY $10,058,300 ------&gt; CHINA
* Bitstamp	BTC/USD $5,692,900

Bitlendingclub recently went belly up.. wayniloans has minimal activity..what makes you think you will succed on p2p lending?
@_date: 2016-12-31 00:39:35
Having Bolivares is not a gamble, its a sure lost!
@_date: 2016-12-31 19:01:40
lol, no idea!.. I guess this chart shows "the official" rate?
@_date: 2015-08-08 00:30:02
it took 1 hour and 15 minutes... its no big concern...just weird, its normally 10 to 25 minutes
@_date: 2015-07-23 14:27:28
will do.. thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:23:25


What makes you think they lost money?.. they could have pumped it and sold at the top and now they have even more money for the next pump.. 
@_date: 2015-07-23 13:17:23
hehe, true that... sorry, will give upvotes instead
@_date: 2015-07-06 16:48:19
Their answer to support tickets is always exactly the same "We're experiencing an unusually high volume of transactions. Your transaction should appear on the blockchain very shortly, if it has not already. Thank you for getting in touch, and for being a part of Bitreserve!"
Its a shame because I love the idea but bitcoin transactions need to be a bit faster... another option is to NOT use bitreserve as a wallet and start thinking of it as vault kind of service..
@_date: 2015-07-23 13:31:18
That could work! thanks!!
@_date: 2015-07-19 23:01:20
thank you! that must be it
@_date: 2015-07-09 03:46:00
very mature response lol
@_date: 2015-07-08 11:45:34
this might be true with most coins, but not litecoin
@_date: 2015-07-19 23:01:47
its a vps.. should be open as I run other nodes for other coins and never had an issue with ports
@_date: 2015-07-03 03:59:58
I see that for some people outside Venezuela is kind of hard to understand but I can confirm that what he is saying is 100% legit and he is not the only one doing it either.. there is a vibrant and growing bitcoin community in Vnzla.
Saludos pana y suerte! 
@_date: 2015-07-08 12:49:13
It will go trough, eventually, i had same issue and it took like 12 hours... hopefully shapeshift will maintain the exchange rate..
@_date: 2015-07-02 19:53:22
Venezuelan, living in Argentina.. i can confirm this is done by many and also very wise since local fiat can easily drop qt least 50 % in value in like a month or sometimes less... if you dont believe me.. just go to surbitcoin.com and check out the market prices graph for bitcoin/bolivares..  in january it was like 1btc = 60.000 bsf... now is 1btc = 129.000 bsf... its stupid to keep your earnings in fiat there.. btc is best and prob only choice since you cant buy usd 
@_date: 2015-07-20 16:15:11
@_date: 2015-07-06 20:47:36
Thanks! please keep us informed.. I hope the problem resolves soon
@_date: 2015-07-23 13:18:18
Thanks, I kind of wanted to do something different, I already have a faucet full with ads! lol
@_date: 2015-07-08 01:35:19
thanks for all your help.
transactions are now much faster.. alsmot instant I would say... I am very happy with the way Bitreserve handled this. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 17:35:28
yes, thanks for that, changed it now.. looks better
@_date: 2015-07-20 16:50:09
thanks, but I have no money on the vps node.. 
@_date: 2016-02-17 11:05:30
I stop using their services when I realized they decide whatever rate they feel like on their weak currencies.... for example they have Argentinian pesos at 19 peso per dollar, when in reality is 14.9, so basically they just slowly take the money from people who deposit on those currencies...
Me and a couple of friends even contacted their support and they said "they were looking for a solution" instead they devaluated the peso even more  while we waited lol... very cheeky on their part!
@_date: 2017-04-10 19:52:05
Hello, I am trying to test this on litecoin so I added this to end of my litecoin.conf: uacomment=UASF-SegWit-BIP148
how can I check if its working?
@_date: 2017-04-18 17:42:56
what a fucking joke!!
@_date: 2017-04-03 15:41:28


if Litecoin gets segwit will Bitcoin become a testnet of Litecoin?.. I am confused
@_date: 2015-07-02 19:49:19
This doesnt apply in vnzla since local fiat lost 100% of its value in 1 month... why in your right mind would you keep your money in fiat instead of bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-04-03 15:39:57
Crazy but true! lol
@_date: 2017-04-21 15:28:06
is Bitcoin Core not an organization?
@_date: 2017-04-10 22:24:50
thanks, it seems I am showing uasf support
@_date: 2016-02-29 14:59:05
I would use a paperwallet and keep it somewhere safe, maybe take a picture of the private key and send it to your email just in case. 
Good luck!

Well, market is pretty small and volatile as it is a tiny coin mined by a few people and only in one exchange: yobit.net, but when I wrote this post 1 Bolivarcoin was 900 satoshi and one bolivar is 584 satoshi according to bitven.
EDIT: at the moment 1 Bolivarcoin has gone down to 400 satoshi lol
@_date: 2015-09-09 14:23:08
Reporting was a bit harsh, but yes I get your point
@_date: 2015-09-22 04:13:04
they dont know much about bitcoin, they have other major issues to solve... basically they have no stance at this point
@_date: 2015-09-09 14:21:57
Yes, I assume we will have to see what the value is in a month or two, thats if the coin still exists of course lol
And yes, I assume market cap of the whole Venezuelan Economy is slightly larger lol, specially considering their oil reserves
Info on Bolivarcoin marketcap can be found here:

I know lots of people personally who mine in Venezuela and make good profit.. just go to bitcoin venezuela facebook group and look at the pictures of miners and people buying and selling mining equipment.. no offense but I think your source is wrong :( 
@_date: 2015-09-09 13:22:50
wow, sorry wasnt my intention.. I read it and it seemed relevant, at least for me that I am Venezuelan..

oh ok ok, I get it now lol

yes, one of the biggest in South America actually: 
@_date: 2015-10-10 13:48:40
Thanks for sharing! 
I have been buying all the way down from $750, I have been able to make some decent money with Litecoin which was less than half its value a couple of months ago and with other altcoins like Ethereum which is more than double the IPO price, I got completly killed with Paycoin tho :( 
I am planning on holding since I like the ability to control my finances, maybe one day they will be worth a lot more and if not, well I will take what I have learned from reading forums, reddit and trading on exchanges!
@_date: 2017-05-06 04:19:10
True that
@_date: 2017-05-07 20:25:33
we move over to LTC until Bitcoin fixes this mess

@_date: 2015-10-11 02:12:48
Wow I am surprised of how ignorant some people are about Bitcoin but I am even more surprised of the hostility towards it... they probably got scammed once or just lost some coins out of their own stupidity and they blame it on "The Bitcoin" lol
@_date: 2015-10-03 02:10:16
The whole event was blown out of proportion !  lol

Comparing a 10% price fall where daily traders lost some money to a brutal massacre in Rwanda..mmmm, yeah kind of f*cked up I would say!
@_date: 2015-10-14 12:20:15
It seems they are going for the non-bitcoin audience, they now have bank deposits and credit cards, which is good I guess
@_date: 2015-10-14 03:45:11
Good to see you are accepting btc.. right move, will be ordering soon

@_date: 2017-05-21 14:51:59
Steem has no transactions fee.. and I guess you could set your litecoin fee to be 1 cent and it will still go trough as well.. I am sure there are many other examples.. like doge that has 1 doge fee which is basically nothing,etc etc

I am very active in the LTC community and I can´t remember one person on Reddit, Telegram or anywhere really that did not want Segwit, there are different channels where Charlie talks to the community and he knew what we wanted.

EPIC MEME!
