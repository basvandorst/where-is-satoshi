I'm on day 5, when it says the transaction time is 2-4 days. Sent an e-mail to support about four hours ago, I guess we'll see. This isn't the first time I've had delays with Gdax/Coinbase... I figured I'd give them a second chance, but here I am.
Update: Received on day 5.

Friends that like drugs / Silk Road
EDIT: Contemplated buying 100 BTC for $1,000. Decided to pay down some student loans instead. I bought in for the run up to $1200 only to sell for a loss after the crash.

There’s a prestigious veterinarian school on the island I had a few friends attend. I’ve stayed at the campus a few times. It’s definitely a beautiful island.

It's a tiny island and the locals aren't very fond of Americans unless they're spending money. You'd have to pay me to live there.

Does it upset you that right now the market is indecisive and most TA is indicating sell/strong sell?

Oh dear god, it’s happening and I wasn’t even in on this bubble. Fuck me.

&lt;- $10k
Bought around $700, sold after the crash. Pretty substantial loss. Not upset, that's how risky investments pan out sometimes.

There's nothing wrong with that! I've traded in and out of bitcoin since 2012. All of us have our own reasons for holding various coins.
