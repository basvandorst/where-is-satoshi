And Randy buys in at some coin that instantly dipps afterwards, and he keeps holding swearing it will soar soon, but actually in denial.

I admire your way of thinking outside the box my friend.

No the fact that it just "evaportated" into thin air. I had my summerjob savings and more on that. And it just was gone, without any evidence to get my shit back. As OP said, it's just "tough luck". And I had to suck it up, because they fucked up. Doesn't matter what number it was, it would've disappeared anyways. Wheter it was 2.9 BTC or 1000 BTC. I'm personally done with BTC, due to the fact of what I lost. Might not be that much BTC, but I had saved money every time I had a little extra since 2011.

Paypal are not dumb enough to accept Bitcoin. And in Paypal I mean the guy that's running it all. This would be his big loss if BTC took over. I mean this is clearly the case. Not the whole guy running it thing (lol), but the fact that they can't accept BTC! Because it will be the end of shitty Paypal and they know it.  I'm totally up for it, I mean Paypal could've been smart. But they're not. So let's see if the smart one rises?

What is this? I was just about to purchase bitcoin for 600$ right now, should I wait or will prices drop now?
@_date: 2014-12-07 13:06:48
Same thing happened to me but 2.9 BTC. This is when I stopped believing and supporting BTC.

I don't know! But everybody! Use this fantastically manicured technique to profit in BTC! WOOOHOOO

Am I the only one who think it's fucking weird they can auction these BTCs? Those coins are from normal people all around the world. Some drug dealers, some medical users, just like everybody else. I mean I think it's morally fucked up how one party of adults can decide what another "party" of adult can a can not do with their self earned money. Fuck this world.

Did you purchase all that BTC? I'm unemployed and am looking for a way to earn BTC online, anyone know a legitimate way?
@_date: 2017-03-13 00:09:56
Jokes on you guys, I turned my phone upside down!....... Fuck me I really should've saved at least some BTC when I was buying weekly in 2011.. Cheers to you lads though!

Same here, I remember a 8th of weed cost like 500 BTC the first time I went on to the Silkroad.
