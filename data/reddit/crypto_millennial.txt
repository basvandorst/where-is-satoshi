Easy. Start using it. Start with Coinbase. Buy BTC for 5 or 10 USD. Try to transfer BTC to your friends. Start reading about it. This will take couple of days/weeks. You will have your first questions - you will find answers on youtube. You will find your favourite teacher on youtube. With a time - you will get some background information. You will want more - smart contracts etc ... other crypto assets ...   
During this time, you can trade on Coinbase. It's fun since BTC is the future.

Would not be a problem in Europe. No taxes since you can instantly buy EUR or GBP  with BTC.   
 "... you may someday sell those bitcoins ..." &lt;- this is dangerous, if price of BTC will go up. = earning.

I bought it at 11K, 8K, 6.5K, 5.5K ... you will see my money first at 1.5 K again ... or lower!!! Stupid bears. They want to destroy BTC - Do it! I will not help you in recovery as soon as price is not above 8K again. This idiots are loosing supporters. Our World needs BTC. I did not come only for money but for the great idea. Stupid traders. HODL.
