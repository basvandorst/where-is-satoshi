[Rosey from Coinbase]( here. It looks like others have been able to provide some explanation, but for a bit more clarity, for US customers Coinbase uses the traditional ACH bank transfer system to collect money from your bank. The ACH bank transfer system is not built for speed – this is why the bitcoin takes 3-4 business days to reach your wallet after initiating the purchase. Once Coinbase receives the bank transfer and the payment clears, the bitcoin is transferred to your account instantly.
For future purchases, you can verify a Visa or MasterCard credit card and purchase BTC instantly! Please note that your credit card will NOT be charged. Your bank account is still debited for the instant purchase. Your credit card is used as a back up form of payment in case there are insufficient funds in your bank account.
You can read more about instant purchases here: 
Purchases using debit cards will soon be available to all US customers as well. We are currently doing a slow roll out, but you'll see the feature available on your account soon!
@_date: 2016-01-12 14:57:18
[Rosey from Coinbase]( here. At this time, debit card purchases are not supported in the US. To purchase BTC instantly, you can, as you mentioned, (1) verify a credit card. Please note that your credit card will NOT be charged. Your bank account is still debited for the instant purchase. Your credit card is used as a back up form of payment in case there are insufficient funds in your bank account.
(2) If you live in a [state where the USD Wallet is supported]( you can transfer funds from your bank account to your USD Wallet (about 4 business days to complete.) You can then use the funds in your USD Wallet to purchase BTC instantly.

Yes, unfortunately, although you're able to charge your debit card as a credit card, it will not enable instant purchases. A credit card is needed as a second form of payment in the case that there are insufficient funds in your bank account. A debit card links back to your bank account and does not suffice as a second form of payment.

Rosey from Coinbase here. I believe there is a bit of a misunderstanding on how our referral bonus works. 
The referred customer must purchase at least $100/BTC in order for the referee to receive their bonus, but they don't have to do so in just one purchase or in just one day. Once the referred customer meets the $100/BTC threshold, whether it be over 2 days, a week, or more, the referee will receive the $75 bonus.
If you have referred someone who has purchased $100/BTC and have not yet received your referral bonus, please email support and we'll be happy to assist you.

You're exactly right. All charges go first to your verified bank account and the credit card is used as backup in the case of overdraft or insufficient funds. Debit cards link back to the original bank account, thus do not suffice as a secondary payment method. It's curious that the debit card worked previously, but after verifying a credit card, customers can purchase BTC instantly without their credit card being charged.
