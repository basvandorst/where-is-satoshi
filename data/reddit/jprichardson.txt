The name comes from the biblical story of Exodus. An allegory... as in, people escaping from the legacy financial system to the new crypto financial system.

It's not.

For those who are interested in programming Bitcoin with JavaScript (browser or Node.js), I wrote a very detailed tutorial awhile back:  it uses an older version of BitcoinJS that is embedded on the page so that you can follow along. This tutorial spawned the CryptoCoinJS project:  
Now the developers of the new BitcoinJS ( and CryptoCoinJS ( are collaborating. Each project is actively developed and has a lot going for it. Bitcore deserves a mention as they are sponsored by Bitpay and are doing some good work as well:

It is. I credit the website for transforming my perceptions on personal finance and responsibility back in 2008 and 2009. I stopped reading when it was sold (2011? 2012?). But it was started by Trent Hamm (sp?) - not sure of his involvement anymore.
@_date: 2014-11-15 05:29:29
Sorry that I made it sound like that it was a direct response to that. It wasn't. It was a response to me not finding any wallets that worked well that didn't control your keys. I thought Coinbase did a good job of being user friendly, but I hated that they controlled my keys; I had already started on Coinbolt. Them locking my account was the tip of the iceberg of my anger :)
**Edit:** What made me even more mad, when I contacted support they made it sound that the reason that they needed additional info was  in response to fraud - which I felt was disingenuous. After a few more emails back and forth, they admitted it was due to them being a registered MSB (money services business) and needing to follow AML/KYC.

This exact same thing happened to me and it pissed me off to no end! They locked my entire account and held my bitcoins ransom: 
So, I made my own Bitcoin wallet:  It's Android only at the moment. But two things stand out unlike the rest: 1) backups are stupidly simple and secure 2) you can try the wallet out with preloaded test coins to make sure that it works and you trust it before committing. Let me know your thoughts :)
@_date: 2014-04-15 11:49:58
My phone isn't really a hotwallet though. I'm curious, where do you personally draw the line with trust on third parties? Apps? Operating system? i.e. Unfortunately, you must have some degree of trust on a third party unless you roll the dice for your private key and you manually sign all of the transactions yourself.

Good point. I was conflating two separate use cases into one statement. My main use case (&gt; 99%) is surfing for stuff via my desktop and using my mobile to buy.
@_date: 2014-10-14 16:26:57
Good question! Basically the master seed is encrypted with both your password AND a Coinbolt key. From this, a special authentication key is given to the app that encrypts the data (metadata only, never your private keys or master seed) and is data is stored on the server.  
@_date: 2014-04-14 23:35:57
That's what really surprised me (everyone saying no). It's so damn convenient... I hate having to type in my CC or copying and pasting shit.

Does it change your perspective if another American company released a closed source app on Cydia? They're still beholden by the same laws. What if the founders released all of their personal info like house address and telephone number as a way to put their reputation on the line? Would that sooth concerns?
**Edit:** I should also make a point of noting that large American companies screw stuff up all of the time. See Linode (hacking cases) and Target (data breach) as notable examples.
@_date: 2014-10-14 16:02:13
Oh, cool. I'll have to look into the Trezor capabilities with the word backup. Coinbolt is using bip39 (standard for word backups) so there's no reason I can't make it compatible.

Thanks. I'm kinda worried that it might be too much for new users though? That maybe I should have some kind of "get started now" mode or something that only allows you to use testnet accounts.
**Edit**: Trezor compatible in that Trezor signs the transactions? No. Do you think new users will want something like that? Also, when you said that you had to confirm the word backup, did you mean by the tapping on the red bar on the main screen? (Thanks for trying the wallet btw)
@_date: 2014-03-09 12:47:29
A lot of people make this claim, but I don't quite buy it. Over 1 million wallets where created on Coinbase. Who knows how many are on Bitstamp. I honestly don't think it matters to most people if it's open source; people just like to believe that they care. I mean, if you use Mac OS X (parts are closed source) or Windows, it's not open source... do you really care? Even if software is open source, say like your favorite Linux distro, you really don't know if malicious code was slipped in somewhere.
I think what's most important is the trust and integrity of the developers and companies behind the software. That's what you should really care about.
@_date: 2014-10-14 21:45:33
Ya, that's what I'm hoping for. I'm hoping that Bitcoin enthusiasts can share the app with those who may be interested in Bitcoin and point out the fun and interactive process of buying fake cats with testnet coins.

Yup, completely agree. I don't know why many people don't consider the use case where you're browsing on your computer and wanna buy something with Bitcoin and wanna pay with the bitcoins on your mobile phone. It's super convenient and probably one of the easiest ways to shop online with Bitcoin.

We are open-sourcing components of Exodus. I really believe in open-source and long-term, think it's important to the strategy of Exodus. I'd like to see a day where 100% of the Exodus is open sourced. I believe I have credibility with this statement given my open-source contributions up to this point: 


The problem with this is that the trail ends from the point of the source code repository to the point of packaging. There's no way to verify that nothing is injected into the distributed package. So at that point, trust is still required.


This doesn't seem to be sustainable. If you have any case studies of this being the case, I'm all ears. But in the short-term, I can't build a business and tell my investors that I'll rely upon donations. There has to be a sustainable way to grow and monetize.
Hopefully this makes sense. Please feel free to ask follow-up questions.

Node.js fanatic here ( and creator of ( nice work on creating your first npm package! This is really useful!
Two simple suggestions if I may:
1. Move istanbaul to your dev dependencies since it's not needed for production.
2. If you switch to superagent ( made by same guy who made Express.js) over request, the module will then work in the browser (using browserify, a tool to make Node.js modules work in the browser) with no extra effort or modification. Win/win :)

@_date: 2014-10-14 16:49:38
Thanks. Good points. 
1) After talking to some friends, the common criticism seems to be that it takes too long to get started for new users. So, I'll definitely be implementing something like "get started now" that is only for testnet accounts.
2) Good point on the note. That's something that I've personally wanted as well and will be implementing soon.
3) Thanks. The cat shop is open source too! 
Thanks for checking it out!
@_date: 2016-12-09 16:27:30
Wow. The fact that you took the time to write all of this is much appreciated!!


The downloadable is now 50% of that. It's so large because it's built on Electron ( - which uses part of the Chrome runtime. Not ideal, but we believe the tradeoffs will be worth it.


Exodus definitely has a problem here, no doubt about that.


There's no fee to backup. Exodus is just asking you to deposit a few satoshis into the wallet first. The reason is that our server has an encrypted copy of the metadata like transaction info (no keys) and it costs server resources. Again, we're not charging a fee but we ask you to deposit money into your wallet so that we can at least be sure that a person has started using it. This may not be the best approach, but it's one we've chosen for now.


- easy to carry wherever you are, on a USB, portable, self executable, multiplatform. I used to have a 2 GB USB encrypted, containing 2 wallet apps (Electrum+Multibit), copies of different wallet files and a password manager. Enough to carry with me wherever I am and open my wallets when I travel.
- easy management of BTC addresses
- easy backup of keys (passphrase and/or private keys)
- PIN /password encryption to open the wallet (not only for transactions)
I agree with this. I'd say Exodus has all of these things today. Yes, even using it as a portable wallet on a thumb drive.


This will probably never happen in Exodus. Too easy to shoot yourself in the foot IMHO. 


Definitely agree.


Did you use our exchange at all? It's built on ShapeShift as well.


We probably won't ever do this :( This feels more suited for a mobile wallet. However, I have thought about some interesting shopping integrations. We'll see.


You did indeed, and I really appreciate you taking the time to write all of this!!

Co-founder of Exodus here...
Today, Exodus is not the wallet for you. It looks pretty, but it's sorely lacking the features for your specific privacy needs. 
To protect your privacy when sending, you should be using a wallet that has JoinMarket or Coinjoin support. To protect your privacy when receiving, a wallet with Stealth address support or BIP47 support would be ideal. Samourai wallet may have these  features - note, I have never used it personally.
Exodus will eventually incorporate some of the more privacy-centric features; however, it will be awhile :(

I live in Lincoln, Nebraska. I remember seeing on their iOS download page that it's only active in "Lincoln, Nebraska" - so I quickly downloaded it. I don't remember if it was possible to sign up for an account or not, if it was, I did. I was never able to use the app.
I'm sure there was some way to use the app, but it was intended for internal testers only. I suspect they wrote "Lincoln, NE" to appease the Apple App Store rules.
I tweeted the CEO, sent email to their support, zero responses.

Hi, co-founder of Exodus here. Exodus is only as safe as the machine that it resides on, more here: 
If you've never used Bitcoin before, and you'd like to get your feet wet, I'd suggest using Coinbase. After you play around with small amounts like $5 to $10 and you feel more comfortable with Bitcoin, you can send a $1 or so to your Exodus wallet and experiment with it a bit.
If it matters, we are a funded American-based startup. You can email me personally at jp or our support: at support You can also call us at 402-500-0805.

Hi, Exodus co-founder here... obviously I'm very biased :)
- If you want all platforms, mobile and desktop? Use Jaxx.
- If you want to hold a large number of assets, use Coinomi (Android only).
- If you want the most beautiful looking desktop application in this ecosystem (hey, I never claimed to be unbiased :p), use Exodus.
The good news is that you can use all three simultaneously and eventually pick the one that you like the most!

I wrote  (Node.js / JavaScript) awhile back. Here's how you can decrypt on the command line:
* Install Node.js if you don't have it already: 
* create a file called app.js
* run: npm i --save bip38
In the file app.js:
    var Bip38 = require('bip38')
    var bip38 = new Bip38()
    var privateKeyWif = bip38.decrypt(process.argv[2], process.argv[3])
    console.log(privateKeyWif)
Run the program:
    node app.js encryptedKey password
Hope this helps. You can email jprichardson if you run into issues. But BIP38 will be around forever. The algorithm is published and there are dozens of implementations.
**Edit:** fixed typo in code.

Hey everyone, ShapeShift allows you to convert between multiple crypto currencies. As mentioned, it's handy to convert to pegged currencies such as BitUSD, NuBits, and USDT. 
This code allows you to drop one JavaScript file into your website and start easily interacting with ShapeShift.io API without programming any boilerplate code yourself. So you could automatically peg to USD or convert to other cryptos with ease in your web apps.
@_date: 2015-04-23 12:02:14
Good point. Thanks. 
@_date: 2015-04-13 03:41:20
Sure. A backup URL and secret token are created from your passphrase. The secret token is used to actually backup encrypted metadata (not keys or anything like that). Your data is backed up regularly. If you lose your phone, it's lost, or stolen, you can simply click on the URL to restore your entire wallet. You, of course, need to enter in your original passphrase. 
Why is this secure? The URL contains data that's also encrypted with a Coinbolt key along with your password, thus preventing brute-force. That's why it's recommended to store your backup URL in your email.
Does that help some? If not, post here again, email jp or call 402-500-0805.

Hey dude, sorry to read all of this! Life must feel like absolute shit right now, but there's a bit of good news. Since you've hit near rock bottom, you can't get much lower.
First, I'm assuming you live in a first world country, presumably the US. The good news is that you won't go hungry and you probably won't hurt for a shelter over your head. Everything is going to be alright.
Second, do this this week: 1) Go for a run, at least 30 minutes. 2) Volunteer for at least an hour, preferably at a food kitchen. 3) Take 10 minutes to be grateful for the things that you have in your life. 4) Take a hot shower for at least 10 minutes. The point of this exercise is start changing your mental chemistry from a focus on yourself to others.
Third, time to start analyzing your habits and time spent. 1) Do you watch TV or play video games? Fuck that shit. The ROI isn't there. 2) Do you smoke? Gotta quit this too. Too much money spent on these things. 3) Do you drink more than once a week? This is time you can spend elsewhere, improving yourself, building business, etc.
Don't talk to your parents about Bitcoin anymore. Just say that you fucked up and you're going to take responsibility and get shit done. They probably won't ever get it. A friend of mine runs a successful international clothing business, his parents still don't get it and think that he's playing on the internet all day despite the fact that he's raining money.
You gotta get a job dude. If you're really into Bitcoin and want to continue to focus on Bitcoin, try to find a job that may allow you to read while you're at work. Taxi driver? Night watchman? Also, you don't need school/college to get a job. That's a lie that the lower class and middle class have been sold. Unless you go into engineering or something practical, college will be a waste of money. The other notable exception would be trade schools, those are OK.
Now's the time to start further thinking about others and not yourself. What problems can you solve? How can you help others? Invent the future friend.
You're not a complete loss, by reading your responses, you're not defensive and you seem to have a willingness to accept responsibility. It does seem like you have a bit of a low self-esteem, but that's probably because of your current situation. Start lifting weights and reading a lot to help boost that.
You're already ahead of a majority of the world by understanding what Bitcoin is. It's gonna be OK man.
@_date: 2013-07-15 21:36:44
It's my understanding that if a Bitcoin payment fails in some way, then they can reverse the domain registration within 14 days or so. So, they're not really risking much.

Jaxx is a lot bigger than us. They have an app on multiple platforms -

Yes, as you can see in the code, that's how it's computed. That was an extremely poor (incorrect) explanation that was probably left in from when I started writing the article. Thanks for pointing it out.

What area do you live in now? What's your motivation for moving to the Bay Area... presumably more opportunity?

I had the same problem, but I emailed them and they made it right. They seem very intent on trying to build a solid, reliable, minimally fraudulent platform. Just email them, they strike me as being very reasonable.

Dude, you didn't sell your integrity for money. I know this may sound a bit cliche and even like bullshit, but that's worth far more. Integrity is such a rare characteristic anymore that when you exemplify high levels of integrity, it'll pay dividends in the long run in the form of trust and respect. Money can't buy either of those. All the times in my life when I was younger and did such things I regretted it 100% of the time. I'm starting to see the fruits of my labor and you will too. At some point, 60k won't even seem like much to you.
Which by the way... what are your interests? Business? Programming? Technology?

Add this to your conspiracy theory:  =)

Awesome, bought some orange soap. I think your prices are too low btw.

Fair enough. I respect your perspective on not wanting to get rich. If the market will pay more, then you could look at it as a way to provide even better customer service as revenue increases, you could hire more customer service people. Also, low prices could turn away some potential customers. But then again, you know your market and customers more than I do. Kudos to you either way!
As an aside, I keep refreshing  (the address your site told me to send the payment to) and nothing has shown up yet. Also, I sent from Coinbase if that matters. When you receive my payment, how will you know it's indeed from me considering that the transaction doesn't have any information referencing my order?
