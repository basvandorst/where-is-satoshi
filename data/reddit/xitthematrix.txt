Let me ask you this and then we can discuss from there, what exactly is Russia being charged with?  Or rather, how exactly did Russia affect the election?  Just tell me your understanding of what actually happened.
And I don't want to hear a mainstream media talking point like "they hacked the election," "they interfered with the election," or "they conspired with the Trump campaign."  I'm talking about what actions did they actually take to influence the election?

They're trying so hard to tie Trump to Epstein, but fully ignore how Trump severed ties completely after Epstein assaulted a 14 year old at Mar-a-Lago.  Also, no record of Trump on Lolita Express.  The smear won't work.
If it comes to light that Trump WAS involved in the sex trafficking and pedophilia, he should be held accountable.

You don't understand the Hillary email case.  She set up an insecure private server and transferred highly classified information to it.  If you or I did that, we'd be under the jail.  It is NOT, I repeat, NOT the same thing as using a private email to communicate about public work.  This shows you have a fundamental misunderstanding of what happened.


He relinquished control of his businesses.  He takes a 0 salary.  His net-worth has gone down since taking office.  Again, this is an MSNBC talking point.


He didn't say Mexicans are rapists and murderers.  He said a large number of illegal immigrants that cross the border ILLEGALLY are.  And the statistics support that claim.
Calling a country a "shithole country" when that country is literally a shithole isn't racist.  It's not a comment on the race of the people, it's a comment on the country's government.  Surely you can understand that.  Just take the instance of the reporter that went to Somalia recently to prove that it wasn't a shithole.  She was killed in a terrorist attack.  What would you call that?
Muslim ban.  Again, no, it wasn't a Muslim ban, it was a ban on travel from countries, countries identified by Barack Obama's administration, as being originators of terrorism.  Look it up.  Those countries just so happen to be Muslim majority.
Birtherism.  You haven't done much research into the birth certificate if you're calling this immoral.  The certificate that was posted on the Whitehouse.gov website by Obama's administration had obvious edits and had Photoshop layers.  This is not arguable.  A scanned image does not have layers.  To question this is what a normal rational person would do.  Does it prove he wasn't born in the US? No.  But why would the file have layers and edits?
If you care to know more: 


Where's your proof?  The Mueller report concluded, no collusion, no obstruction.  Can't wait to see Mueller's testimony tomorrow!
So again, you've just spouted MSNBC/mainstream media talking points.  These are nothing but leftist political smears.

Correct, the job of a prosecutor is not to exonerate. It is to prosecute crimes. There was no crime, therefore no prosecution. The investigation was allowed to reach its conclusion unobstructed. There's no room for argument on those facts, especially after the Mueller testimony today.

Yes he could be charged after he leaves office, if he was guilty. He's not, as we learned in the report and as was repeated in the testimony. There's no arguing this point, to argue Trump is guilty of collusion or obstruction is denial of reality.

@_date: 2019-07-27 03:17:30
You do realize you literally just described domestic mainstream media on point  correct?
Here is one of the first results I found about Russian Facebook ads:  
They were purchased against both candidates.  If you honestly think these ads swayed votes, then I don't know what to tell you.  This is milquetoast compared to the daily propaganda and fake news onslaught by the mainstream media.
Secondarily, I'm still not convinced that Russia hacked the DNC server for the previous reasons I have stated.  Any competent hacker can leave faux fingerprints on audit logs if they know what they're doing.  Couple that with the fact that the DNC hack was more likely a leak from the inside based on the transfer speed of the files... and well yea that's a whole other story that is equally as conspiratorial as the official narrative.
 
Thirdly, I haven't seen any evidence the electoral systems were tampered with.  If anything, allowing the southern border to be wide open and allowing illegal immigrants to vote in our elections is WAY MORE HARMFUL than any Facebook ads that were purchased by Russia.
Here's what I'm tracking.  Humor me, as this will probably be the last post I make on this thread.
Hillary and the DNC paid Fusion GPS to gather opposition research on Donald Trump's campaign.  Fusion GPS developed a "Dirty Russian Dossier" that involved fanfiction of Donald Trump and Russian prostitutes engaging in golden showers in Russia on a bed that Barack and Michelle Obama slept in. This Trump-Russia Dossier was literally made up to make Trump seem like a deviant and compromised by Russia.  
This dossier was then handed off to John "the snake" McCain who delivered it to James Comey, head of FBI at the time.  Comey did not do any verification of the authenticity of the dossier and leaked it to BuzzFeed news which then published it as fact.  The dossier was simultaneously used in numerous Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants as justification to spy on Trump associates.
And spy they did.  All the while, being soooo sooo confident in knowing that Hillary would win and their treasonous spying (and numerous other crimes) would never be found out.  
Except she didn't win.  
She lost.  
They never thought she would lose.
And so, the insurance policy known as "Crossfire Hurricane" had to quickly be mobilized in an attempt to frame Trump in order to remove him from office before he could expose the extent of their crimes.  This was known as "the insurance policy" in the Strozk/Page texts.  The Mueller investigation was an attempted coverup and frameup job, that failed miserably on all fronts.  Every Trump associate that has been arrested or charged has been charged with crimes that have nothing to do with the Trump campaign itself or, as in the case of General Flynn, by use of a perjury trap.  "When did you do X?" "I think it was April 12." "Wrong, we have evidence it was April 13. You lied to the FBI."  Indictment.
"This just in! General Mike Flynn has been arrested for lying to the FBI in the Trump-Russia case. More at 11!" 
And thus, the Mueller investigation ends with no charges for Trump.  No charges, because there was no evidence of a crime.  The investigation was allowed to completion, thus no obstruction.  Imagine being investigated with the full force of the US government for 2+ years, over $30 million dollars, and them coming up with NOTHING.  
Now that the investigation is behind us, you will begin to see the results of the REAL investigation start coming out.  The investigation of the investigators.  AG Bill Barr has EVERYTHING.  Everything they did the entire time is recorded.  From the phony FISA warrants that were used to kick start everything, to the text messages that the FBI lovers Strozk and Page sent back and forth plotting to remove him.  EVERYTHING.  It's going to be historic when it all comes out.
There is so much more to the story.  You can dig for yourself, or ignore it all and wait for AG Bill Barr to declassify it all.  In the end the truth will win.  Everything I have typed above you can verify for yourself.
Some people will reject the truth at first.  But that's the thing about the truth.  When you're all alone, just there with your thoughts, it begins to nag at you.  You know truth when you see it, when you hear it... even if you don't want to accept it at first.
Anyways, it's been good conversing with you.  When all of this comes crashing down in the next few months I'd be more than happen to have a beer over Skype with you.  Just let me know.  Peace out!

There is precisely 0 evidence that Russia hacked the DNC.  The FBI never got to investigate the DNC server, it was given to the private company Cloudstrike.  They produced a report and gave that to the FBI.  They could have said you hacked it.
Either way, you say Trump obstructed the investigation.  According to Mueller this morning, he didn't put any limits on his investigation, ergo, he didn't obstruct.
So how did Trump obstruct?  He didn't.

Fiat never lasts.  You seem to think that somehow the "wealthy" could even make a dent in this debt, and that is laughable.  By design, fiat depends on more and more debt in order to even stay afloat.  I'm partially convinced that is why Obama and Trump have increased the debt to such unsustainable levels.  It's monopoly money.

The impeachment is a complete sham.  They are doing it in secrecy on second/third hand information from an unnamed "whistleblower" that was already debunked by the release of the call transcript.  The Russian collusion narrative failed, so now they moved on to "Ukranian quid pro quo" delusion.  It'll fail too, because it didn't happen.

We have the transcript, I've read it twice, quid pro quo didn't happen.  The Ukranian President has also said as much.  Schiff and the dims never expected Trump to declas the transcript, which blew the entire thing out of the water.  There were numerous staffers and officials on the original call, listening in.  It simply didn't happen, and if you have a specific section of the call that you'd like to discuss as proof it did I'd be glad to take a look.
IMO, it is an act of desperation by threatened democrats to remove him from office before the next election.  Because they are running a bunch of clowns that have no hope of winning an election.
The good news is, you won't have to believe Barr.  There will be plenty of evidence provided by IG Horowitz, Huber, and Durham to support any claims, whether that is wrongdoing by R's or D's... the chips must fall where they may.  The court of public opinion and the media will have no bearing on the outcome of what's coming.  The investigation is now a criminal one as of a week or so ago, so I fully expect there to be indictments as a result of the investigations.

It is just propaganda designed to tax the air you breathe, nothing more.  Is the climate changing?  Sure.  But the sun has much more to do with that than any effect humans are having.
And if this is not the case, why are the biggest polluters never pointed at during the discussion?  Could it be that the biggest polluters started the propaganda for competitive advantage?
