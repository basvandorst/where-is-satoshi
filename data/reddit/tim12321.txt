I gave mine an 'I.O.U', with the ability to claim once they understand the basics and set up their wallet.

Been waiting a few days to get verified on Quadriga so far.

Is there a new fork or something? What am I missing?

I'd like to be a part of this history too. Hi. Hodling since 6k!

I just bought during the dip. Coinbase was fine for me.

Bought at the dip, appears to have mostly recovered. This never happens to me!!

What's does this reference?

Are you willing to lose all your savings? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:33:36
When does it count? When the average of all exchanges reaches $9k USD?
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:15:08
Then I would highly advise you not invest your entire savings. 
Invest what you're willing to lose and no more. For all we know bitcoin will crash to $0 in the coming weeks or months. Highly unlikely, but not impossible.

Really annoyed I can only buy $100 (CAD) worth on Coinbase right now with my $250 weekly limit. Waiting to get verified on other exchanges.
This process sucks, really want to buy more on the next dip.

We did it Reddit!

Unfortunately there's nothing you can do about this as far as I know. Cryptocurrency is a double edged sword, and I'm sure you already know never to hold your crypto on an exchange. Sorry to hear this.
