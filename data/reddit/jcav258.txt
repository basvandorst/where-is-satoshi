Circular argument is circular. Devil's advocate says two thumbs up

80% up is wiped out by 40% down. Your point is well taken, though.

Very possible.
 


On what time horizon?

I agree with your sentiment that Bitcoin is not a business and should not be treated as a business investment; it's in an entirely different asset class but an asset nonetheless.
Much akin to gold, Bitcoin's value is inherent in it's scarcity and the general acceptance of its value among the rising class of crypto assets.  Discounting the functional benefits of Bitcoin, it is a store of value in which the monetary exchange rate is pegged to its demand and scarce supply. The price will rise and fall accordingly, much like gold. Speculating the value will rise is simply speculating the demand will increase. There are a number of reasons individuals believe demand will increase and decrease; their summation is today's market price.

I would speculate an even more severe drop, as many people put their extra "play" money into Bitcoin. Therefore it might be their first sell after a layoff or general shortage of money in a recession.

The average person does not time the market for profit. There are generally at least as many losers as winners in that game. Of course there are outliers

Actually "HOLDing" and dollar-cost-average buying (or selling) is an extremely common investment strategy, for a variety of risk portfolio investments (401k, etc).  It's also generally a good strategy for your average non-daytrading investor.
