It's especially unbelievable in the face of the "slap on the wrist" fine given to HSBC and other banks that have been caught red handed *intentionally* laundering billions for terrorists and drug cartels.

It's always been this obvious, hamfisted badmouthing.
*"Bitcoin, a revolutionary digital currency, continues to gain adoption as &lt;blah blah blah&gt; and reached new heights at &lt;prices&gt;, when it was just &lt;something lower&gt; only &lt;some months/year&gt; before.* 
*Bitcoin is only used by drug dealers and for hiring hitmen, and guns! Guns are scary! Hitmen! ONLINE HITMEN! Scary online hitmen with scary digital money! Not accountable to any central bank regulators! OOoh scary."*
As an aside, you also have conspiracy folks trying to pass it off as the (long rumored) one-world currency which can be controlled and manipulated by central banks. I fully admit I look into plenty of conspiracy topics, but that idea is just beyond the pale.
It'd be like trying to say back when BitTorrent was new that it was created by the MPAA/RIAA as their new distribution platform. Doesn't make any sense.

Haha JP Morgan CEO, CEO of a company caught red handed laundering drug cartel and terrorist money, tries to badmouth Bitcoin for being used to buy drugs.
How absurd. That anyone would buy what this chump says is absolutely pathetic.

The future is decentralization, not regulation.
