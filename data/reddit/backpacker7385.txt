Rather than just putting your whole $3k in, start buying in with smaller amounts. Maybe start with $500, or even $300, and then set a timeframe where you buy an equal amount every week or month until your whole budget is invested. This will help you avoid the high spikes, but really there is no bad time to buy Bitcoin. 
Also, rule number one of Bitcoin is to not disclose how much you're buying. In ten years, if $3k becomes $3million (hypothetically, for examples sake) a post from today could make you a prime target for hackers. The internet never forgets.

Why do you suggest buying from the Ledger website instead of a third party retailer?

Not exactly. Hardware wallets like Trezor have a backup built in by using your recovery seed (a long string of random words) and pin. But if you lose the seed/pin and the USB is damaged, *then* you're screwed.

Didn't realize it was a throwaway, and it's still good advice for others, but let the downvotes rain I guess.

You definitely shouldn't sell before the fork. The fork may make BTC a bit more volatile than usual for a bit, but unless $37 is make or break for you (in which case it shouldn't be in Bitcoin to begin with), you'll do much better by holding it in the long run than trying to beat the market for a few bucks here and there.

... or a future fork adds more decimals. Bitcoin can't be **the** world currency with only 8 decimals if the price rises significantly. If a hospital stay only costs 31 sat then how do you pay for a taco?

In a Lambo though...?
