That's the witness byte. But if the way signing is happening isn't changing, then how does it reduce the size of the block?

It's where people talk up bitcoin a bunch, getting the new guys really excited so they buy a bunch. Then the whales sell off taking everyone's money.

Good video, but it doesn't really answer my question. How are transactions signed in segwit? It seems like you're trusting a 3rd party to sign for you, then add a stamp to the transaction. Am i understanding this wrong?
@_date: 2017-02-20 23:11:05
Part 2: Transmission of signature data becomes optional. It is needed only if a peer is trying to validate a transaction instead of just checking its existence. This reduces the size of SPV proofs and potentially improves the privacy of SPV clients as they can download more transactions using the same bandwidth.
If the transmission of the transaction signature becomes optional, what's to stop a node/miner from pushing through a transaction that hasn't been signed properly?
My understanding is that the public key is signed with the private key, creating a new hash that's tacked onto the transaction. If this data is removed from the transaction, how will we know what's valid and what isn't?

We aren't talking about BU, yet you use it to dismiss the argument about cultural hegemony. Think about that for a second. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 23:14:56
Funny, I hate this sub because most people are just throwing around opinions without any proof or hard knowledge to back up those opinions. Then Pat their fellow opinion holders on the back as they reject anything that doesn't fit the narrative that they've been given. Proof is something you should ask for before you believe anything. If you don't, chances are you've joined a cult without even knowing it. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:59:52
It seems that you've ignored the main body of my argument. Carry on.
@_date: 2017-02-12 18:23:23
You're assuming bitcoin will still be around in 28 years. Which is highly questionable given the current state of affairs. I want to believe, however history has taught us many lessons about politics and what's happening right now in the bitcoin community. Never once have things that continue down this road turned out well in the long run.
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:14:37
It means that every person has their own perspective of what happened. Most original bitcoiners saw original devs be destroyed by a coordinated propaganda campaign designed to distort objective reality. Do you really believe someone that Google hired to be a technical lead on Google maps is a junior varsity coder? 
@_date: 2017-03-02 05:58:16
It distorts reality for those under it's effect. Wikipedia has a decent 101 on it.
Have you read both white papers, and looked over the source code of both? Do you know the background of the devs on both sides? Do you know what concepts from BU are being used in future core updates? If you don't understand the fundamentals, then how can you have an opinion?
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:47:51
You're trying to obfuscate the issue at this point. Time doesn't matter for validating. This is a non issue for nodes. 
Get the last word in if you must, but you're ignoring my argument by switching the subject constantly. MINERS are the subject.
@_date: 2017-03-15 11:18:06
And your kind of ignorance should not exist. But i don't blame you, you're stuck in a world where your perception is shaped for you. This could have happened to core just as easily. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 04:45:24
Lies and slander. Your comment does not fit the narrative i've been given. Have an up-vote. Err uhh, i meant down-vote. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 19:06:59
What other interest groups are at play here? You seem to believe that you aren't supporting one. I'm not trying to argue with you, i'm just trying to get you to see objective reality and how confirmation bias can cloud your ability to see it.
@_date: 2017-03-15 16:06:36
I'm not mad at you, I'm mad about how few people in this world understand the type of manipulation that you've fallen for. I'm mad that it's becoming more prevalent in the world. I'm mad that basic philosophy isn't a requirement in gradeschool so that people can understand the difference between knowing something, and just regurgitating what they've been told. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:43:17
While the premise is true, the supporting arguments are warping objective reality. The average internet connection in the united states is not 0.25 Mib's it's closer to 10-60 MiB's depending on the time of day. I can't even understand how they could have gotten .25 even if they took into account mobile phone connection's and legacy industry that's still using old school phone line modem's 
When i see something this distorted in an argument, i tend to believe that the person making it will just say what ever sounds good, regardless of facts and reality.
Here's an example of how distorted this is.
The fat dude on the airplane is so fat that he uses all 80 seats on the plane. Therefor no one else can fly today. And because no one else can fly today, the airline industry is going to go under.
The freeways are going to shut down, because old people drive at 1 mph. And because there are a bunch of old people, and they all drive at 1 mph, our freeway infrastructure is going to be useless.
These two examples are equal in magnitude to the argument being made about connection speed. It's ridiculous.

I wonder how many people are going to lose their shirts over hype trading this week.

Any developer will tell you that code reviews will not catch every single bug. It should also be noted that the attack happened am hour AFTER the fix was released. The cultural hegemony is real. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 23:10:54
Proof? Proof? You can't handle the proof! Seriously, because there is none. This is another long winded propaganda post. The cultural hegemony is real man. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 02:05:23
Came here to say the same thing.
@_date: 2017-03-07 22:55:10
Because few people understand how old the problem is. Or just how savaged their privacy has been with no hard justifications given. You'll understand one day when the FBI shows up at your door step to tell you that you're under surveillance because of an "anonymous online tip". This really fucks with your head, and makes innocent people wonder what they've done wrong. In my case, i'm fairly certain it's harassment for spewing information about CISA, that was passed in the 2015 BUDGET BILL.

Have you ever been apart of a code review? Do you understand what that entails? 
@_date: 2017-03-08 08:18:19
Yeah, back in February of 2016. Nothing came of it, but some really strange shit happened for about 8 months after. Random strangers would come up and strike up conversations about anti-government nonsense. Had a guy following me around taking photos on a hike. Had another follow me around taking photos of me while i was taking photos at a local park. The strangest was when i was walking around a lake, and two guys kept slow jogging past me talking about surveillance. Really threw me for a loop. Haven't had any issues for about 4 months now. I'm thinking about doing a FOI request next year, to find out what triggered them.

Welcome to the early 2000's
@_date: 2017-03-15 17:01:46
I don't, they have more devs. I do however disagree with the premise that they are infallible and immune from bugs. 
Do you even understand what i'm talking about?
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:57:03
I understand now, that you're not trying to make an argument in the realm of dialectic or good faith. Have a good day.
@_date: 2017-02-20 23:06:22
I'm very confused then, because my understanding, is that segwit is being introduced as a way of making block data more compact. Along with fixing a malleability problem.
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:21:33
Pretty safe. Most use a burnt in boot loader that can't be altered. And firmware upgrades that have to be signed to get past that. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:24:54
For that to be true, your connection would have to be around 13-15 KiB's at the 8mb block size within 10 minutes. And correct me if i'm wrong, but for VALIDATING a block, there's no time limit.
The reason this is an issue for miners, is because of the lag time it takes to upload a FOUND block.
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:55:40
I wasn't, thank you for that. I made a bad assumption that bitusher was making an argument in good faith.
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:09:20
Like i said the premise of the argument is correct. But the reality of the situation is not. 
If you live in a country where bandwidth is an issue. You have other berries of entry that will be hit for MINING before bandwidth. And if you can get past the cost of mining equipment, and availability of electricity, you can get around bandwidth with low geo orbit satellite connections.
If you use TOR for mining, you're doing a  disservice to the TOR community when you could easily be using VPN or at the very least proxy.
And why are we talking about nodes? Nodes have nothing to do with the argument. We're talking about miners.
@_date: 2017-03-02 02:55:46
You don't understand what cultural hegemony is. Or how distorting it can be. Do you.
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:38:03
They're stealing our network! Quick let's steal it before they do. 
This is the reason the alt-coin BTU is a thing. Many users feel that there's a totalitarian presence trying to take control of bitcoin for their own ends. Explain to the users that there will be better peer to peer transaction coins, and that Bitcoin is shifting to a foundation currency/commodity. E.g. Gold/USD/Petro dollar. Instead of trying to shape the conversation/perception through hype/propaganda/hysteria. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 18:59:48
That's not true. Core doesn't control the network. They require semi consensus from the miners. If they tried to "force segwit" right now, they would be the network minority, and effectively splinter them selves off from the main bitcoin network.
@_date: 2017-03-02 05:52:12
I don't condemn core it's self. I condemn the PR and zenzersherp that shuts down anything off blackstreeeem message. Think of what rhymes with the words. You can't even say it without the AM zenzering the post.
The argument of BU or Segwit is something i need to actually take the time to research. Looking over white pappers and source code before i make my decision there. My only argument, is that cultural hegemony is usually only used for nefarious ends. It's an immediate red flag for me when i first join a community. It's also something that the community can never see for it's self, because it's done outside of their carefully curated perception. At any rate, check out reddit (replace the R with a C) and see for your self.

How is it deflationary? Transaction fees are recirculated and new bitcoins are being added to the ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:12:29
That's only true because we're still in the initial phases of adoption. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:35:56
Is that deflationary... or less inflationary?
