What you want to do is go to the tools menu and use the "Reset Blockchain and Transactions tool." Pick a date before the borked transaction and rescan. It can take some time depending on how far you go back, but it should fix the problem.

Those'll be the days. Then again even $1200 wouldn't be so bad. The whole run up should be pretty fun.

It's a time weight. Earlier bets are weighted more heavily to enourage not waiting until near the bet's closure date to place bets.

No real reason to upgrade. It works, your blockchain is in sync. Keep on keeping on.

I guess one of the morals of the linked post is that legitimacy can be a temporal thing. Vigilance and a low tolerance for bullshit re also necessary though to keep services legitimate. If you would have asked me in March of last year if I though BitcoinSports.eu would ever turn scam I probably would have answered with a hell no. Over time though circumstances can change.

I think a key part of his request is that he wants the store experience where he can try some guitars before picking one and getting it kitted out.

The solution then is to hold out. Plenty of people still run 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8 with pre-0.8 users changing one config option. 
@_date: 2014-11-14 17:00:56
Your best bet if you want to purchase the guitar in a retail store is probably going to be going with a friend who has dollars and wants bitcoins, then having them guy the guitar for you after which you reimburse them with Bitcoin.

RealSolid has... a history. After the SolidCoin and Microcash debacles, I am thoroughly surprised Mcxnow could get any traction. He has a clear pattern where he offers something, makes his money, and then he quits.

Since Multibit is moving to a deterministic wallet, they are killing support for wallets that are just a collection of keys. You should be able to use older version of MultiBit. Version 0.5.11 works for my uses.

Check Timmothy B Lee's writings. He was sure Bitcoin was finished in 2011 after the first Silk Road bubble. Now he is suggesting this might be a cheap time to buy in.
Time offers perspective. Nothing facing Bitcoin now is anywhere near as grave as things in late 2011 seemed. It isn't that journalists covering bitcoin now don't have a clue, it is that most of them are incapable of having a clue.

What you want to do is run an actual Bitcoin Client which stores you own keys like Electrum, MultiBit, or the full client. Anything kept on Circle and CoinBase is also Circle/CoinBase's to know.

It isn't the house edge, it's that the the returns are lower now, because the earlier bettors get a higher % of the return. It's how a time weight works.

RealSolid, the Mcxnow operator has always been a scummy fuck who makes things, shuts them down, and then disappears for months at a time. He has done it several times with SolidCoin and has yet to turn any donations he has recieved into his new altcoin MicroCash he has been promising since forever.
The solution is to research the people running things before using or investing in them. I confounds me to no end that RealSolid using the same username and connections was able to raise any money or acquire any of the trust necessary to get people to even consider using anything further he had a hand in developing.

If BFL delivers at the process size they promised and really did have their wafers move all of the way to being bumped today, then they can put some hurt on ASICMINER in the long run. ASICMINER made chips on a 130nm process size while BFL is promising 65nm, so the difference in energy efficiency would be quite pronounced. Avalon made 110nm, but when will the rest ship?
I spent a good amount of time as a BFL skeptic, but right now I'm rooting for them because I have to if a decentralized network is going to have a chance.

Ponzi schemes are an important point in the history of bitcoin as they separated a number of people from their coins. Pirate and his damn pass throughs being most prominent.

I believe I might have something of a translation:
No, we won't talk about Miruna Siminel, Marta Usurelu, Vali Perfu &amp; co. This is just way too good to spoil it.
I am looking for something as a description for some pictures I got on dtng (of which I find thousands or start moving, one chan stuck on Romanian Internetz as found it?) When I made that word again. It did not exist until now, neither in Romanian nor English, as we are provided by Google.
It iss strange that thing? It kind of has to be. Prostitextuate as a verb in English, to literally prostitute yourself. Or as a noun, the (and rarely at that) who literally prostitute. A bookish sort of prostitution as well. It is prostitextua in Romanian. A prostitextuata -this could be a woman who checks the hard theory that leads any paper. Vellum the skin of heifers.
It could be the future job writing that complains of the whole world, like the smell disappears in a printed book, the carnal pleasure of browsing pages. It's definitely the future of journalism, this poor girl who has everything smelled a great literature table set two hundred years ago and with this the feast was over, the creditors have stormed and the palace closed, even the bitches were fed up and retired the corners slightly hung over to dry, only journalism still was not received at the table. And again not received at the table, even admitting the absurd that someone would put out something for the reason that there are no simple meals.
The idea seems to promise me, reading other ladies, nude ladies too. Cyclic text in nature, from the mouth in to the mouth. From the hand on the breast and thigh on the eye. From lusting to lashing. You do realize what anthropology quote fits here (for lack of anything more appropriate, of course)?
I think it's an absolutely brilliant idea, frankly. I wonder how many girls would fill the Sonnets? That the State PRISTINA, would only nominate nudes?

If you want to make a paper wallet you want to make it with a machine that preferably has never been connected to the internet. Baring that you ar least want to make it locally on your computer.
You absolutely do NOT want some web site making a paper wallet for you as that kind of defeats the purpose of making a wallet for offline cold storage.
