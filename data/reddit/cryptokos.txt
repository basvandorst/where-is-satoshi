You fucked yourself up. Don't blame it on the exchange. Your deposit would have been converted to tether, which you then would've been able to buy your BTC with. You didn't want to do it, and requested a cancellation which probably froze your funds, and now the exchange is backed up and will take time to get to your ticket.

I think the value would increase if it was known no more BTC was being minted. The same as when it is all mined out.

No. Bitcoin is a bubble. It is a series of bubbles. Each one pops, and then suddenly a larger one grows. I believe we are on the 8th bubble now...this is from AA himself, so relax.

I withdrew 5k sc earlier to the SIA ui with no issues. The good thing about the SIA UI is even with its issues, it is usually able to recover data.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:59:26
you are dumb. this is the 8th or so burst. It crashes, good time to buy more, especially if you time the bottom. Then it rises higher than ever. I expect 25-30k this time.

Better odds with BTC
EDIT: I have extensive knowledge with roulette. I have had 100 million pass through my hands at the roulette table. No, it doesn't mean I was ever rich, it just means I have placed bets, lost and won equal to 100 million over my time. My biggest win was 10k and I was playing 10-20-30 bets.

It is sad to see people use Tulips as a reason to not invest. My own brother spouted this shit to me at Thanksgiving when I gave him the tip of a lifetime. His response was that this is like the tulip bulbs, and that he doesn't invest in stuff he doesn't understand. He could have afforded a coin or two, maybe more. I can only afford 100ths.

I told my brother and my father. My father more-so because of all the help he has given me over the years. I told him, this was his chance to recoup all that money in a short time. He would've bought at around 9, and sold at around 15.5 if he had listened to my advice. :(

Generally borders change after a world war. We have had only 2, but that has been the case both times. A country that no longer exists, no longer gives value to its money. Crypto is international, even if borders shift and money comes and goes, crypto can be traded across borders.

Well for a small fraction, amounting to a paltry $15000 gift, I would be willing to invest said money into BTC, on your behalf, mind you. Then I will wait til it grows to 50,000, and pay you back 25000, whilst keeping the other 25000, the money I need to pay off all debt. Thank you.

I know absolutely 0 about rules and regulations predating 2017. In the new law, it is illegal to hide funds in any way. I believe a mixer would be construed as such.

how much BTC did you drop?

antminer is a hardware miner for BTC. Cgminer is a software miner for certain altcoins.

I didn't buy BTC when It was around 200, because my (now) wife. Its ok, she gets to live in poverty WITH me.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:30:02
buy some litecoin, and transfer out?
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:05:04
depends on the coin I believe. BTC for instance has a ledger of all transactions ever recorded within the blockchain. Those transactions can be tracked 100%. Monero on the other hand, might not have that transparency. That's what makes the new US law valuable. If you intend to hide your crypto and not report it, you are breaking the law.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:33:02

What I am seeing over and over, is worry about taxes. US exchanges are required to send out tax forms like any other business. Those forms should have all the data you need. Of course, keeping your own records is good, but for people worrying about it in the US, it will all be documented.

It doesn't stabilize it completely. It does make crypto more stable than tangible monies. BTC has a coincap of 21 million. BTC gets around this by forking and creating new Bitcoin branded cryptos. Some cryptos have no coincap, and can have more coins created or burn coins if the "entity" behind it chooses. The second example being of the same structure as tangible monies.
Crypto is more secure, and thus more stable.

@_date: 2017-11-27 10:25:54
Can bitcoin be counterfeited? Hard currency can and is counterfeited. Can we do this with crypto? If not, then it is already more stable than a hard currency.
