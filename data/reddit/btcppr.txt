This is the second part of a series of two-day special report about Bitcoin adoption in Puerto Rico on one of the main TV networks on the island. We installed Kryptokit on the reporter's laptop and she made a purchase on Tiger Direct. All people on the news room were amazed and loved it! 
EDIT: QR code shown on camera is the actual kryptokit wallet of the reporter.
@_date: 2014-09-05 14:58:14
I somewhat agree with you, but overall, it's the best mobile wallet out there.
@_date: 2014-07-30 17:06:38
Merchant will still pay ACH fees when converting to fiat? Is the minimum ACH withdrawal still $20?
@_date: 2014-08-10 21:53:38
When you say "no bitcoins will be lost at all" you state that you'll reimburse "invalid" withdrawals with your own BTC. So it's more appropriate to say : "all accounts affected by the security breach, will be reinstated as of their last valid transaction at our expense" Correct?
@_date: 2014-09-08 01:53:39
Their approach was better since the beginning, they do not need an app only a browser.
@_date: 2014-08-26 22:23:49
for mini figures... yes.

I requested them more than a month ago to update their map to include local merchants that I can confirm currently accept bitcoin, just so they get the exposure they deserve for being early adopters; no answer. They published a link to submit merchants, I did submit some a while ago, no update. More robust options are and will be available. I already stopped begging them and moved on to better things.
@_date: 2014-08-20 17:55:12
That's great! Congratulations!

Believe me, it would not be in american soil. Do you know any merchant there accepting bitcoin as payment? We have some in the main island listed at bitcoinpuertori.co (hosting down right now). Will go soon there to leave some educational material to merchants.
@_date: 2014-08-25 20:09:54
and they use paypal for donations, a centralized payment method with history of blacklisting anti establishment entities.
@_date: 2014-07-31 17:16:47
Got it! The thing is that for example, gas stations, which I think are key, at least here in Puerto Rico to adoption since every other day almost all human beings visits one. Savings in transaction costs for the station and savings in gas for the customers are a very attractive scenario.
The thing is that usually they have a minimum for gas purchase with credit/debit cards. Usually $7/10.
Since the initial volume will be low for bitcoin transactions, the gas station owner may want to have a minimum transaction for bitcoin purchases of $20 (even if they are having 0% transaction fee). That sign at the door will not look good for bitcoin adoption.
We're trying to figure out a way to convince them to give some kind of incentive for bitcoin customers. If you guys have some case study on a gas station (or any other), we'll love to see it.

If you ever go to Puerto Rico ,  ~~All of them~~ keep them in BTC. Except the bike store.
@_date: 2014-01-10 21:23:06
If your PC crashes and you hadn't performed a manual backup (or you had a brainwallet) BTCs are gone. No auto-sync or auto cloud backup.
@_date: 2014-02-06 01:08:39
Please, first update Android version with a rock solid app. Don't waste much time in HTML5 for Safari, if you're using some code from coinpunk, QR scanning is cumbersome and not even 60% accurate. 
@_date: 2014-07-30 17:10:54
Do you have a referral/partner program? We are actively promoting bitcoin adoption in Puerto Rico since last year. We need some help with resources to push merchant adoption. Like sales support material, pilot support. We can help translating material to Spanish if needed.
@_date: 2014-09-21 11:29:16


no thanks.
@_date: 2014-02-01 16:02:17

Sadly, they must comply with KYC rules if paying Andy. So I'm assuming they'll use Coinbase or some sort of web wallet. I hope I'm wrong.

lol... (clogged GIMP airbrush)
@_date: 2015-03-22 10:59:48
That was our approach since the beginning. But it takes lots of educational resources and time (money) to make merchants confident to make the decision. We did it in Puerto Rico to some extent. Monetizing the effort was not our main goal. 
@_date: 2015-10-22 01:35:05

Bitpay assumes the "risk" for the merchant and it's instant as soon as it hits the blockchain. Had some issues with coinbase as client, as they sometimes don't release them instantly. In that case you'll receive a late payment notice from Bitpay. No issues with native clients. Yes, smartphone or tablet with a browser and Internet access.
@_date: 2013-11-01 13:49:23
Yeah, but he/she assured me that he/she would place the order again... still waiting. The fact is, since the surge, all Bitmit sales practically halted. Even when I told the customer that he/she was getting goods for less BTC that a month ago since prices were set using USD.
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:19:07
Yes. We had some merchants who downloaded Coinbase iOS app. The app is handy but has a nasty bug that when you request payment it prompts for a QR in BTC denomination even when you input USD. So if you are no cautious, you can ask for an 1.50 BTC cup of coffee.
@_date: 2013-12-22 20:10:45
the package doesn't seem to work on Mac OS X and yesterday they were changing registrars. Some of these may be the culprit.
@_date: 2013-09-24 18:32:14
¡Excelente! Acá a sus órdenes.
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:24:20
Say that a merchant signs up with coinkite and now have a "bitcoin POS terminal". How is possible to make native bitcoin payments without the "cumbersome" QR codes. Because as I see, you offer debit cards that link to a coinkite hosted wallet and clients need them to pay with them. Isn't this complicating things more?
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:48:59
You may be be surprised how awesome it is!

I don't know for sure, but this is the program's web page : 
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:14:00
The easiest and fastest way for them right now, given iOS restrictions, is Coinbase via Safari. But we've setup some with Blockchain.info paired with Gliph (they sell between each other) and bitcoin-qt on Android devices.

Most of them are keeping it in BTC and using it to buy stuff between each other. Some are thinking having their websites hosted on btc accepting merchants so they don't need to use credit cards, for example.

To be fair. The withdrawal transaction was waiting for confirmation even when I'm pretty sure I did confirmed via the email link. Today I entered the dashboard and saw the withdrawal transaction with status : N in the "confirmed" column. I resent the request, login to the dashboard again from my phone and clicked the link. Now, it was confirmed. Five minutes later, I now have my mBTC minus their comission for actually doing nothing with my money.

Bitpay solved this from the beginning by using a simple link to invoice. No need to login to the dashboard. So, you only need a browser and there's no possibility of employees accesing your money or your account.

Estancia Verde Luz is the first farmer/merchant to accept bitcoin at San Juan's natural farmers market.

I must agree that everything, from the website, to the ability to accept also litecoin it looks extremely professional and state-of-the art. But, I must agree that the price each is obcenely high. I'm not sure how a merchant or someone who may do a business of renting the devices to them will achieve ROI. I can hear the merchants : "but, wait a minute! wasn't this supposed to be cheaper?" The only application and possible ROI I see is in the remmitance business.

My research indicate that, for now, Bitpay is more economical for SMBs over Coinbase. In a coffee shop at rush hour you need speed. Also, it's kind of a risk that you need to log into your full wallet with Coinbase, just to access POS tool. With Bitpay you only need a link on your device and that's it. You could also configure Bitpay to cash out to an address, not a bank.
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:04:35
We've intensively promoting bitcoin usage among local organic farmers in Puerto Rico and once they understand the benefits, they're loving it! The latest to adopt the digital currency is "El Departamento de la Comida" (The Food Department), they promote and support local agriculture without pesticides and of the highest quality, making it available at their place and also preparing vegetarian dishes with them.
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:46:41
Best bet is using Bitpay. No need for apps. Not subject to Apple wrath. As soon as they approve, you're ready. Configure 2FA and setup your withdrawal options. You only need a browser.

“I’m sure you’ve heard about bitcoin, the most popular virtual currency in the world and also have attracted large businesses. It’s almost anywhere! In China, for example, it currently has 50% of global transactions and it’s price has increased significantly. In United States it has become a topic of debate, including Senate hearings. 
For example, in Silicon Valley there’s people investing millions of dollars in it. Additionally, Ben Bernake, president of the Federal Reserve commented recently that the unregulated virtual currencies could become a long-term promise.”
To give context to what you should know about this currency we welcome Jose Crespo, bitcoin promoter and user.
Mr. Crespo, welcome and good morning!”
**Jose Crespo:**
“Good morning Alejandra”
“Not so long ago people labeled bitcoin, simply as a fad or a hobby among Internet geeks. But, what is it exactly? Can you explain us? In simple words!”
**Jose Crespo:**
“In simple words, we’re talking about a digital currency based on the Internet that allows any person to send and receive money from one place of the world to the other, in a secure, efficient and extremely inexpensive way.”
**Alejandra:** 
It’s regrettable use as a speculative instrument has cannibalized it’s immense potential as a currency. Is this the reason why it’s so unstable in it’s price?
 **Jose Crespo:**
“The volatility it’s mostly caused by strong adoption in markets like China, United States and Europe. In many cases, like in Cyprus, there was an intense adoption a couple of months ago because of the banking crisis where people recurred to bitcoin to rescue their money.”
**Alejandra:** 
“And, what exacly can we purchase with bitcoin?”
**Jose Crespo:**
“Well, we’re seeing that we can buy almost anything. We have organic farmers selling their products for bitcoin in Argentina, in Puerto Rico there are local merchants accepting it. Places like pizzerias, bars among others. In United States, for example, there’s charity down in Florida receiving direct bitcoin donations and providing help to unemployed and homeless people. They’re doing a great job there!”
**Alejandra:** 
“In that example you gave us, we’re seeing that there are places all over Asia, Europe Latin America. But, then where can we purchase this currency online? Obviously, we can’t go buy it at a bank as I understand. It’s simply on the Internet and it’s really a virtual currency. Isn’t it?”
**Jose Crespo:**
“In that situation you can, for example, sell services or products and get bitcoins in return over the Internet. Also, there are services, an ecosystem is flourishing around this bitcoin platform that allows you to link your personal bank account and exchange your local currency for bitcoins. Then you can perform all the transactions online with it.”
**Alejandra:** 
“Well, seeing our graphic showing daily transaction volume, bitcoin is beating Western Union and it’s second place next to Paypal but, the question is, Jose, what assures us that this is not a fad and that is here to stay?”
**Jose Crespo:**
“The platform has been in operation for 5 years, it has been monitored and audited by expert mathematicians and cryptographers. Our opinion is that it has completed that phase and tested itself. We’re seeing confidence in it, for example,  transactions like the one made by a flight attendant from Hawaii, who purchased a ticket to space from Virgin Galactic using bitcoin. The confidence is there, we’re seeing both ends of usage. From huge transactions, like that one, a ticket to space, to small transactions and microtransactions from small merchants, farmers and ordinary people. Also, for worldwide transfer of funds, from one country to the other, you can make them in seconds, and that maybe why bitcoin is gaining popularity over Western Union by the fact that, it’s much more efficient, faster and way cheaper. The cost of that transaction could be comparable to the price of a package of chewing gum.”
**Alejandra:** 
“Thanks for explaining us, Jose, a bit better, what is bitcoin, how to use it and if it’s here to stay. Jose Crespo, user and promoter of  bitcoin in Puerto Rico, the enchanted island. Thank you!”
**Jose Crespo:**
“Have a nice day!”

The story goes like this: the owner refused to pay the carrier $300 (AT&amp;T) to fix their phone and attempted to fix it herself. Something went wrong (maybe a teared ribbon cable) when putting it back together and they found out that applying pressure fixed the problem, so what they had at hand was a clamp. That's the restaurant phone, so there's no big issue there to have a clamp.

They may not go that deep (they may go in the line with today's CNN article about Bitcoin Black Friday), but you're definetely right. Thanks!

So, this was surreal. Because of the written article on CNN about Bitcoin Black Friday that week, I was asked the day before, without much preparation, to do this interview. I was unable to sleep that night (unable to get a good shave, sorry!). Tried my best. With a bit more time, I think I could cover more and do better.

Congrats! We also removed MacOS from our laptops and installed Ubuntu. Not missing a thing.
