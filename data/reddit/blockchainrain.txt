As long as it's not the only crypto you accept it's probably not as risky.  If you are putting all your eggs in BCash though I would not do that based on that post and some of the other stuff being posted.

$100 in Bitcoin or $5000 in Nano a worthless turd?  What's it like to shill something worth nothing and be serious about it?  I weep for you.

DropBit by far - for all the sort of reasons you are saying Green lacks.
@_date: 2019-04-23 13:24:05

should we take your word for it or read the data in the post that shows charts of their buying behavior?  
@_date: 2018-12-27 23:43:51
just sent $5 in bitcoin for the simple fact that he now takes it.  Wonder why everyone doesn't market that they take BTC and take the free money from the shills like myself.
