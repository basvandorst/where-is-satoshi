Starbucks already has a well established gift card system integrated with their apps, etc... Not sure why they wouldn't just accept multiple crypto currencies in exchange for gift cards. That way you can specify a minimum, such as $20 worth.

Actually it's pretty simple. Just use a segwit wallet address.

I want to agree with you, but I prefer to err on the side of caution. In any case it's only $100 so probably not worth it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:35:08
if you remember back to the time of the Bcash fork, Coinbase initially said they will not support it, but there was a big backlash which I think included legal issues with "holding" on to customers Bcash, since if they were in possession of the private keys, not end users, that would be kind of like taking free coins from customers. 
So having that requirement to give the forked coins back to users probably just led them to fully support it anyway.

Someone else in this thread has estimated roughly 25% of that BTC... so maybe 15? Not too shabby.

Mark has already said even if he could get any he wouldn't want it. He's accepted how much of a fuck up the whole thing was; he only wants to maximize what the original mtgox users can get back.
@_date: 2018-08-24 16:56:16
This is definitely a big problem since it was already a few years ago. I would say, make a list of possible addresses, then start with the most likely one. If it's rejected, try the next. As a last resort, use the offline method (you have until October 2018).

And the amazing thing is, after flipping the coin 160 times, you'll have generated a number that has never ever been generated before, and probably will never be generated again!!! (Probably meaning 1 out of 1 quintillion chance... Yada yada yada)

No, it literally knew that I can buy bitcoins with the coinbase app!
@_date: 2014-05-04 14:34:47
This is the correct answer. I talked to an Indiegogo employee directly recently and he alluded to the fact that in a lot of campaigns, users get refunded if the goal isn't met.. Which means indiegogo would have to store the original bitcoins in a separate wallet for this feature to work, which adds significant complexity and security risk. 
Also it would be challenging for a campaign manager to hit a goal they set... They would have to set it in BTC only because setting the goal in USD could mean one day the goal is met, and another day it's missed.
All that said, it could work in pure donation mode without goals and no refunds... But then you lose the momentum and group mentality aspects of the platform. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 11:52:35
You're definitely overreacting.  The email clearly states that they don't get it right 100% of the time. Anyway, move on if you're looking for a service with 100% reliability.  I don't think you'll find it though.

@_date: 2014-04-23 21:44:44
My point is that even though the protocol itself is sound and decentralized, humans aren't. Bitcoin is tied to the social nature of humans (the developers team, the exchanges, the mining pools).

Couldn't you just claim you donated it anonymously to, I dunno, the EFF or wikileaks? But instead transfer it to a secret address you created

@_date: 2017-08-10 17:16:37
Yeah this is the main one. Don't think about it from the angle of "reducing number of men in Bitcoin" think of it as Getting 50% increase in # of users. Or I guess 40% increase based on this poll.

@_date: 2017-08-06 15:29:06
I tried to do it before but what stopped me is the various interfaces online that couldn't switch from BTC. Sure I could always just do the math myself but I don't want to take the risk of missing a zero.
Example: I have my wallet set up to show and use mBTC. I make a purchase online and it says send 0.005678 BTC to xyz address. Now I have to be careful and make sure I enter 5.678 mBTC.

This is the Biggest most naive argument I hear about this. It's sad you don't understand how hard it is to have multiple competitors in one area. Oh I guess unless you consider 2.0 mbps DSL over a phone wire competition.

Let's take a step back here though. Is this a potential threat to Bitcoin? Suppose bitcoin got really popular and was accepted at many places. Could/Would Visa threaten companies to NOT accept Bitcoin or else they would prevent them from using Visa?
@_date: 2012-08-18 15:38:36
Well actually, Bitcoin only does one of the 2 things that credit cards do: make online transactions (fairly) painless and possible. Credit also lets you buy things before you have the money (which is not a good idea anyway but people do it). So it's not a full competition

True but also technically anything purchased with Fiat is Bitcoin not obtained. In other words if I choose to spend my fiat now and hold BTC, it's practically the same as spending BTC and then rebuying BTC to replace what was spent.

There's really no proof of this, and in any case the fault would be of purse.io not the item receiver. Authorities would not show up to your door for buying things off an accredited business. They'd go straight to purse or shut them down.

There's a service out there to "resend" a Bitcoin transaction that is taking too long due to low fee... Some require you to submit a small payment (also in Bitcoin) to do it, some are free. Sorry don't have the link at the moment.
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:59:45
I doubt it would ever drop back to $1000 at this rate. Too many are too interested and invested in it at this point (unless a critical vulnerability was found). A ton of people would instabuy tons of it went near 1k USD or GBP

I had the same thoughts even though I was downvoted to hell. And when a service is under super high load and overloaded with angry user support requests, is the best time to launch a digital attack against a company. People say stop comparing this to the mtgox massacre but it draws many parallels. I do feel bad for coinbase though, when it was running well it was good. 
My account had all active sessions killed and I had to log in again on all devices ... That usually signifies something happened and data could have been leaked. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:42:41
They each serve different purposes and have slightly different features. ETH supports smart contracts which can be used for custom business logic. Litecoin has CPU intensive hashing which won't be much accelerated by GPU s or parallel processing (I think?). Bitcoin was the original but suffers from transaction bandwidth chokes.
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:56:34
Haha wow that's pretty funny, but makes sense
@_date: 2017-05-26 04:30:33
Ok now explain why without warning or notice, ALL my sessions were cancelled and logged out, and I had to log back in with 2FA on each device. This is either data loss or a safeguard if intrusion is detected.

Just spent 1100 USD equivalent on Newegg using Bitcoin a month ago. Worked great!
@_date: 2017-06-06 23:03:16
Ok I understand now, thanks. So a bank could theoretically continue to be the middleman between a home buyer and a home seller (for example). Let's say I have 20 BTC but want to buy a 100 BTC house. A bank could say ok, give me 20 BTC and pay the rest back over 30 years (80 BTC, not usd).  If they have 80 already they can give the seller 80 + 20 = 100, the full amount. 
However if that bank does NOT have the 80 extra they need to get it from somewhere... In the current fractional reserve system, they can get it from the US government via a similar "loan" b/c the Fed can "print" more funds , in a controlled manner, but nonetheless out of thin air. With BTC this step is impossible, only if the US government had 80 BTC in reserve would it be. they cannot provide that full 100 BTC to the house seller, period unless it existed in their control.
(I'm using "US government" as an example but could be any Nation that doesn't back funds with a finite resource). 
@_date: 2019-05-23 22:03:15
I think this is why I'll probably never convert back to fiat (except maybe privately), there's just too many problems and risks involved, too much fine print and bull shit. Not saying everyone can or should but it's my plan.

Yes it does, good point I usually never try higher than he recommended amount
@_date: 2017-06-27 22:17:47
Yes it's volatile but the reason why I don't agree that it's not a sound investment is because unlike a company, Bitcoin cannot "go bankrupt" or suffer from lack of profits. In the long term, Bitcoin will either maintain or grow its value. History has proven that if you wait long enough (granted, could even be a year) you will regain your invested value and likely with be worth more as it becomes more embedded in the businesses and financial systems of the world.
As for the algorithms, if a flaw is found, I think we would all be in a huge amount of trouble; not just Bitcoin. Banks, credit cards, and Https all depend on similar encryption technology on which Bitcoin is based.

my guess is that you were hacked. Normally you'd just be another needle in the haystack of bitcoin users, but due to your somewhat public activities with camewhore stuff my guess is that some hacker targeted you specifically (got your IP/information somehow?) and then waited for the right moment to strike.
Definitely delete/reset the API key, that is as good as having your username and password without actually having it.

Haha history repeats itself. I was here when mtgox was new with bitcoins and were hacked via elementary means. Passwords were stolen.

End well

People didn't switch a year+ ago when they were hacked with a full database dump, what makes you think people will switch now?

Just explain to people what Bitcoin is so they understand, but leave it at that. Let them decide if they should use or support it or not.

This kind of thing won't work in business tx since the coins could already be spent by the time you input the paper to your computer ( if the giver changes his mind). So in that way I agree with you. But this way is fine for giving to friends

This is also how I respond to any shady craigslist requests to sell &amp; ship my items far away. You don't want to purchase my stuff in person with cash? OK no problem, you have to use bitcoins though!

Whenever I think this I just remind myself that I truly just want bitcoin to succeed as a commonplace currency. If that happens, everyone wins

And ironically you can pay captcha breakers in bitcoins so they can be any country around the world :)
