Yeah this is one I usually go with, but then I get "Well, who created the mathematical problems and where are they kept?" At this point I told them that it is not centralized by a third party, but people still think they come from somewhere, so that's a third party... And saying that no one really knows who created it doesn't help them to think it's legit.

This exchange is terrible. They wouldn't verify me and it took 2 months to finally receive an email back saying that I didn't provide them with enough info. I went with vaultofsatoshi and got verified with the same info I provided to virtex and was trading within 48 hours.

Bought at a few at $1100 because I honestly thought it was going to keep on going up and didn't want to have to buy in at like $5000 or something. Silly me... I have come to terms with my loss and still holding and going to hold forever. I'm going down with the ship if it comes to it.

Great read. I think I made my mind up

Well, not entirely. But what about the guy that found his hard drive he lost in the junk yard that had 7 million dollars worth of BTC?

I was thinking the same thing.

I just went this same process. I was about to give up. Then I found out about vaultofsatoshi. You'll thank me later.

That statement is 100% accurate.
