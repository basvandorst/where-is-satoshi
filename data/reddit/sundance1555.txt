Thanks for the reply.  Do you think that the burden from the capacity increase achieved by segwit is similar to the burden achieved by a 2x (non-segwit) blocksize increase?
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:44:58


Since Segwit was a soft fork, and therefore backwards compatible, it can't have "changed the limit" outright.  (Non upgraded clients wouldn't understand the new limit, and it would therefore be a hard fork.)  I think the more accurate way to describe it was that it allowed a tx format where the signature was not included in the block but rather in an additional data structure outside the block, with a calculation that would limit the size of signature data.


Aren't signatures already (i.e. w/o segwit) allowed to be pruned?  How is your definition of segwit different than the pre-segwit pruning of signatures?

The Hong Kong agreement  specified a hard fork to increase capacity.  Why would you say that SWSF would fulfill the agreement?


I'm not sure I understand this -- segwit increased capacity by putting signatures outside the block, while maintaining the same block size.  How would it have been possible to move the signatures outside the block without increasing capacity?  (unless the blocksize were actually reduced?)
I'm still not entirely clear on your answer to the question:
Is the burden from the capacity increase achieved by segwit similar to the burden achieved by a 2x (non-segwit) blocksize increase?

Fine with me-- where would be better?
@_date: 2017-02-03 03:12:09
I guess I meant it doesn't matter in that it doesn't have an impact on how the network (as it currently exists) performs.
It does matter insofar as it can be used as argument that there are users out there that want to use bitcoin but are unable to due to the backlog, and therefore the block size should be increased.
I think we're on the same page here-- let me know if I got that right.

How was the 85% threshold arrived at?  How do you determine whether this requirement is met?  Are you looking at bandwidth, RAM costs, storage costs?  The reason I ask is because I wouldn't have the foggiest idea of how to evaluate the network and determine that 85% of the economy is able to run a full node.
I'm sure you realize that that the ability to run a full node is not something that everyone involved in Bitcoin prioritizes to the same extent that you do.  Do you know what factors BU miners are considering when they set Maximum Block Size Accepted ("EB" setting)?  Do other larger block proposals explain their rational for why they have the right blocksize?

Yes, but doesn't spam usually have lower fees than non-spam transactions, implying that the spam is not having a meaningful impact on the fees required for legitimate transactions?  In cases where the fees paid by spam are in line with legitimate transactions, how is the spam causing more harm to the network than legitimate activity would?
Do you think very much spam is actually being written to the blockchain?  After all, there already seem to be more legitimate users than the network can support, and legitimate transactions will usually rise above the spam due to fees, right? 
How often does the mempool get cleared?  Does spam represent a significant burden on memory for nodes?
@_date: 2017-02-03 03:06:58
Yep, that makes sense to me.  It seems that your answer implies that spam isn't a problem that anyone should get upset about, right?  
I guess I'm confused because whenever the tx pool gets backlogged, I see arguments about whether a "spam attack" is going on.  But I can't understand why anyone would even care that spam is occurring UNLESS the network is extremely vulnerable to this kind of disruption.
Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the arguments I'm seeing.  Is the r/bitcoin rebuttal actually: 
"This tx backlog isn't actually a problem that anyone should care about because it's spam so it isn't actually impacting any legitimate users"

I understand that it's fine to not be in total alignment with the project's community, leadership, or roadmap.  But those differences can only get so big before you have decide that a project isn't for you, and you've said a lot here that runs counter to central goals of the BTC roadmap.  There already is, and has been for quite some time, a serious movement to block whole classes of transactions, simply because those classes violate the sensibilities of BTC designers.
I think SatoshiDice is a perfect litmus test on this.  Check with BTC supporters to see whether they find SatoshiDice spam for the network, or a valuable early use case that allowed the network to spread and grow.  I think it will be a very one-sided survey, in large part because the BTC roadmap has stark differences from the philosophy of permissionless uncensorable interaction with the network that you have eloquently advanced here.

Given that this sub's moderators' opinion on this has a big influence on this sub's moderation policy, I believe this topic to be very much on-topic for this subreddit, in spite of the automod notice that I received on posting this.
I'd be interested in hearing their thoughts.

I already have a node up and running, so I'm not going to purchase anything.  I would just like to see how to configure Tor so I can have all node traffic us the Tor network to access the internet.
@_date: 2016-11-09 01:19:43
That's seems to be the biggest issue that I've uncovered-- that someone with a proof of stake in a chain also has equal proofs of stake in forks of that chain, so there's no mechanism to force convergence on one chain.
@_date: 2016-11-29 17:19:53
What makes a block a "poisonous block?"  Simply its size, or would there be other characteristics that would disrupt the network?
Does the disruption come from burden of validating a poisonous block?
@_date: 2018-06-05 05:13:10
Do you realize that this not the majority opinion in the BTC community?  Many prominent BTC supporters, including many core developers, have made many public statements about wanting to exclude large classes of transactions from the blockchain because they are spam.
In response to a previous statement you made:
\&gt; It's just smoke and mirrors to try and back the narrative that Bitcoin has high fees and long confirmations.
Are you aware that high fees and long confirmations is a stated objective of the BTC core developers?  It's not exactly slander by BTC detractors when Greg Maxwell himself says that this is his vision for BTC.

Will what mmgen-py posted work?  Do I need to download the expert bundle first?
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:18:50
I'm surprised you didn't have anything to say about his 2.2/4.4 blocksize points.  You advanced what appears to be a very different claim-- that we should view SW as having a blocksize of 4MB.  Is that what you were saying?
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:41:50
Ok, thanks.
Two other questions:
1. If it turns out that SW blocks wind up at 2MB, would you support a 2x increase if it came from core?
2. How long after most wallets implement SW do you expect it to take before we've seen how it plays out as far as average SW blocksize?  In other words, supposing that we see average block sizes of 2MB, how long would you want to see that average maintained before being comfortable with a 2X increase?
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:35:15
Where could I get some information on the SW transaction format, e.g. how UTXOs are encumbered, layout of the unlocking script, how multisig on a SW address works, etc?
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:06:41
Not a lot of numbers in that post to do math on, unfortunately.  Of what's there, though, I'm curious your basis for claiming the following:


I'd also be curious about your calculations on how long you expect that to continue to be true.  I would expect this to include some good data on how you expect users to grow, e.g. factoring in the crazy rate of coinbase signups. 
Another question: How did you calculate this safe percentage?


@_date: 2017-11-06 21:15:14


For someone without background on why these things are clear/apparent, can you explain why?
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:02:14
Wow, it's almost like node count isn't a very good measure of protocol support or something.
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:04:45
It takes a special kind of mind to observe that node count fakery is a problem while simultaneously asserting that "node count IS protocol support"
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:41:28
Just to make sure I understand-- you're saying that the wallets are prioritizing supporting the forks over SW, thereby delaying SW support?
I remember reading that pretty much all the major players had SW support ready to go prior to activation?  Why was that story so widespread if it was untrue?
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:35:08
"Real nodes?"  Who decides this?  You?  Naw... it should probably be baked into the protocol somehow...  You understand that this is the entire reason Satoshi Nakamoto included mining in Bitcoin, right?  It's in section 4 of the whitepaper:
The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making.  If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able   to   allocate   many   IPs.


I thought the supporters of B2X are the ones accusing the 1xers of having a sybil network, and the opponents of B2X were the ones making the case that mining majority isn't relevant?  How is the mining majority on the same side as the sybil network?  Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the situation here-- do you support B2x?  Because the fork left with a small amount of hashpower post-split would be the one more properly described as the "sybil network," no? 
@_date: 2016-09-11 14:39:45
Bummer.  Is there a way to participate in the network that isn't mining and doesn't require downloading the entire blockchain?
@_date: 2016-09-22 02:52:32
Can you explain in more detail how to do this?  Or perhaps link to a source with more instructions?  I'm fairly new to this stuff.
@_date: 2017-09-20 13:36:36
The appeal to Satoshi's use of the term "peer-to-peer" in order to make the argument that all users should be able to run nodes falls flat when you realize that Satoshi addressed this issue directly and that no tea-leaf-reading is necessary to divine his intentions.
Satoshi proposed scaling Bitcoin by increasing block sizes and stated that nodes would grow so large that they would need to be run in data centers.
You can make the argument that Satoshi's words imply that users should all be able to run nodes, but you'll wind up arguing with Satoshi himself in short order.

I'm not sure what you mean by "calculate their next block template."  Did my post responding to blackmarble above describe it correctly?
@_date: 2016-10-28 18:58:54
Yeah true.  You know I don't even know why bitcoin went through all the trouble to stop double spends since what good is it to own bitcoin if you end up double spending and undermining faith in the whole system?  Double spending is therefore illogical and won't happen even if it were possible.
@_date: 2016-10-28 18:54:16
Ah, thank you.  I'm going to rephrase what I think you said to make sure I understand the bigger picture-- please lmk if I got it right:
Headers are broadcast before an entire block.  When a miner receives a header for block n, he immediately begins mining block n+1 on top of n, but he includes no transactions in his attempts to mine n+1 because he can't be sure which transactions available to him for n+1 may have already been included in block n.  (Including a transaction in block n+1 that was in block n would make block n+1 invalid.) Once he receives the entirety of block n and validates it, (which is done by validating all transactions, the merkle tree/root, and the header hash), he then begins including transactions in his attempts to mine block n+1 so he can get all the fees in those transactions.
@_date: 2016-10-28 19:00:15
Thank you-- very clear explanation.  Not sure why your response was sitting at the bottom... I wish I'd seen your post before puzzling this out in my response to blackmarble.
