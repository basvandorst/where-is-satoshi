Bitcoin will lose its value quickly if this happens. You will be affected too don't worry.
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:30:18
Interesting what price bitcoin would have if you didn't have big central exchanges.. Like i said they are not going away, we need to address these issues. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:26:20
Thanks, i'v added 10 EURO and won 11.5 euro, withdrew without any issues. but i'm wondering if i'll put 1000 usd and use the small stake strategy to win 1$ easy time.. by increasing my bet by x2 until i win and repeat, how do you make money? (except the 2% on withdrawal)
and is there a maximum deposit?
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:43:38
Is it instant? Provides instant liquidity? Can support large trading volume quickly? I think not.

Nice math bro, for him to gain 20000$ one bitcoin needs to be 100,000$+
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:23:23
How you want people to buy\sell quickly if there isn't any exchange with liquidity? How do you want to top up your debit card with $$ if you aint got no liquid market to do it? It becomes useless.

@_date: 2016-04-27 08:09:22

@_date: 2015-06-08 22:35:48
Now this looks like a job for BTC
So everybody just follow Bitcoinity
Cause we need a little transactions fees
Cuz it feels so empty without Satoshi

As someone who knows, if you are going to do this, make sure to do it on 2-3 different sim cards. They can stop working easy. Never mind what kind of cold storage you use, make 2-3 of them. Never trust single method.

Because they are anonymouse, they can manipulate their own market to make some extra $$, as i said they have many people using their leverage on meta trader, so a quick flash crash will close their accounts and thoes people will lose all their btcs. Thats what happened to my friend.

They know centralized blockchains can't really compete with a decentralized one, so to make it on the same level, you concentrate your marketing on all the "bad" things decentralized blockchains offer, ask for heavy regulations and when its on the same level as centralized one, you claim that you can give better service with the centralized one. No thanks.

My desired result is not having cold storage bitcoin address (i know what it is), but to have a "dummy wallet" which if found/hacked will show the hacker balance of 0 btc and wont affect me, but if used with extra "information" like password or something, will able to show the real storage

@_date: 2016-02-22 13:37:59
when you "naked short sell" something you don't have, you create new stock from thin air and drop the real stock price down. did you even watch the video?
the only rigging can be done with bitcoin is by the exchanges.
you know why? because i have my own copy of the bitcoin blockchain. so i know exactly how many bitcoins there is.

I think because it will do 2 things, 1. Bitcoin Devs will be more "relaxed" and it will take more time to push the update, meanwhile 2. bitcoin will become more centralized as less nodes participate as the cost of maintaining the blockchain ledger becomes larger.

What do you think about NSA using QC to break 12-24 word key phrases used currently by almost every big wallet (Mycelium, Ledger)?
they only use normal words. how hard for QC to break that?
@_date: 2016-02-21 18:07:27
anyone tried this service?
@_date: 2016-02-08 20:36:10
The issue is not NSA breaking SHA 256 and ECDSA ATM, but using QC to break all current 12-24 regular word phrases that almost all big bitcoin wallet storage companies using (Ledger, Mycelium, Trezor). correct me if i'm wrong?

Nice math bruh, he bought 0.17xx btc with his 100 dollars, so it means he has approximately 1/5 of 1 bitcoin, which means if he wants to profit 20$k on his 100$ investment one bitcoin needs to be worth 100$k

I am looking for a "no brainer" solution, so you dont need to think of anything, you just know that it exists and only your "data" can access it.

So 43x140√3 cm?
@_date: 2015-10-19 22:07:06
Im sure with the technological advancement of today it is possible to create one. You are puting all your bitcoins into one device which can get seized\stolen or break, im talking about encrypting your private key so you can access it from any device but only with your data (dna, finger print, eye scan) Its a big difference.

weird that this "notcraigwright" guy registered 8 days ago (how did he know to do this before all this press release?) it seems like perfect "chaos", but if you look closely you can see what is going on. maybe all this is a perfectly executed plan to hurt gavin &amp; more respected names in the industry?

Again, its not a solution. I am not interested on trusting my bitcoin on that one/two or three devices.. Im not interested on giving them my private key. I am interested on encrypting my wallet with data that only i have (no brainer) and don't have to remember it or even think about it. Just access it with any device (that can read my data). A "no brainer" for the avg. Joe.
