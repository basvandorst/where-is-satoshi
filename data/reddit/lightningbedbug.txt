Oh he's right.  Bitcoin can't save Greece right now.  Bitcoin prevents fraud through competition over time.  EVERYONE needs to start using bitcoin in some way. 
Our process of money creation is BEYOND fucked up.  Don't you wish you had the power to create currency on your whim?  We don't TRULY KNOW when new currency is created and who it goes to.  Anyone that claims otherwise is lying his ass off.  
Currency creation is how you maintain oligarchies and prevent working people from enriching themselves FAR more often.

EVERYONE SHOULD GET BITCOIN IMMEDIATELY.  You don't learn by not doing.  Get your hands on 2 loaves of bread worth of bitcoin.  Send some to your family.  Have them send it back.  Let them get 2 loaves of bread worth.  Play.  Learn.  Don't stagnate in theory while you're trying to learn how it works.  Play with small amounts.  That's the advantage of bitcoin.  It works EXACTLY the same with 2 loaves worth as it does with 2 yachts worth.

She JUST NEEDS TO START USING VERY SMALL AMOUNTS.  Everyone does.  Familiarity is the number one thing to help with security.

He's just being overly cautious after saying bitcoin will never drop below 500.  He's learned some lessons on the power of authority.
