I respectfully disagree.
From what I have read and seen, hard fork, soft fork, whatever, it doesn't matter, welcomes ANY plan that works and increases Bitcoin to scale with more demand.
Maybe I am delusional and I'm surrounded by lunatics who want nothing more than to "Destroy Bitcoin" and "Pump Altcoins" all day, however I haven't see it and find it laughable when others refer to with these descriptions.
In one simple sentence, my opinion on is:  A group of people who want Bitcoin to grow, gathering in this subreddit to circumnavigate other Bitcoin subreddits that do not allow discussion on Bitcoin scaling options other than what Core decrees.
Maybe I am delusional, however when I read posts from those outside of trying to describe I can't help but think they are completely wrong and simply spreading false information.
I am not a programmer, developer nor do I submit code. However, from my point of view, on the outside looking in, the matter of hard forking Bitcoin appears to have long passed beyond the scope of "handle with extreme care" and appears now to be simply a matter of "do nothing".  
I apologize if my opinions are wrong, that's simply how I see it.

I was not able to open that wallet and reach the GUI to attempt a -reindex.

I copied the wallet.dat  file into the new wallet and BOOOOM!! I got my Bitcoins back =]

"priority of  is still baffling to me."
How is this baffling to you&gt;?
Core's developers work for Blockstream. Blockstream's agenda is to produce the Lightning Network as the answer to Bitcoin's scaling issues. 
Core is doing exactly what they are paid to do, thwart Bitcoin's on-chain scaling and create the Blockstream Lightning Network as the answer.
@_date: 2016-09-30 17:23:57
Good rationale. Let all the large companies go to Ethereum while Bitcoin is ran into the ground.
Just keep your head buried in the sand, nothing to see here, move along.
@_date: 2016-09-19 19:58:59
LightningCoin, due to the fact everyone will be forced to use Blockstreams Lighting Network.
It's a completely legitimate question.
@_date: 2016-09-30 12:58:55
Because Bitcoin can only process 3 transactions a second.
And another company leaves Bitcoin due to the scaling issues created by Blockstream/Core.
Well done.
@_date: 2016-09-20 02:09:16
I'm an everyday normal person invested in Bitcoin asking a perfectly normal question.
Do you think Bitcoin should be called LightningCoin when everyone in the World is forced to use the Lightning Network?

True scaling? Yea, sure, let's implement a 3rd party (Blockstream) solution to the original Bitcoin network since the Core dev's can't seem to figure out how to scale Bitcoin, oh wait, that's right, their being paid not too because they work for Blockstream.

"If ETH had anywhere near the true value and attention of btc the same issues would arise.
