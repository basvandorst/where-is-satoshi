Yeah it just doesn't make sense.  Pure marketing

Why not follow any standards and call it a microbitcoin.

Annd I'm done with coinbase. Easy peasy

Lol basically Americans run everything good because so many try to take advantage of the system?

It's because they didn't have the credit card infrastructure like the US does.   Retailers will accept whatever is most common.   The credit card companies have invested heavily to get consumers hooked with rewards and interest rate offers.  Privacy is absolutely the same comparing mobile pay to CC.  
Keep in mind though the US has turned to digital payments substantially.  Do you go to the bank with wads of cash or deposit a check every week at the bank? Many don't.

This is still a small portion of their revenue model.

Uhm dotcom bubble. Housing bubble.  Maybe it wasn't accessible to you, or you are too young but yes this type of value inflation has repeated many many times.  Crypto is an asset just like the dollar or oil or a share of Google and valuation is just it's estimated value compared to other assets.   If people see other things that are more valuable it's price in relation to those will drop.

I could see a fedcoin backed by the federal reserve keep in mind the US monetary system and the dollar isn't managed by the government, its managed by the federal reserve.

It's not though. It's not easy to use or accessible or versatile.  Most people don't know what it really is or why the value is high, it's just catchy, it's digital gold.  Until it gets government support it's all going to be priced on speculation.

Yes this time because it became known.  Small takes shifting BTC or LTC by not so much wouldn't be as obvious
@_date: 2017-06-24 18:22:36
That's what makes this type of manipulation feasible.  Who is holding them accountable to not do this.

I spent time mining in 2009.  Got bored after awhile and played tf2 instead, forgot about the wallet and have no idea what I even mined anymore.  Hard drive is long gone too.

Avoiding legal consequences.  Shocked there isn't a class action for that kind of error.   I had a BS stop loss on gdax on litecoin too where they sold $10 under the market price when there were a ton of bids above what I paid.    I have a feeling this has been an ongoing manipulation for awhile and this one just was big enough to stand out.

There should be short circuit to prevent this type of issue.  I also wonder how much is being done by or with consent of GDAX.  The payback may have been a fraction of the money already generated by such a scheme.
