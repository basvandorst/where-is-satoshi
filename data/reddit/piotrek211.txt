bro, brand name &gt;&gt;&gt; technology. You think someone will use any of that "technology" provided by alts? it's all about making money, if now btc moves 20% up, expect -30% on alts
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:31:57
it surely is 30k+ colombian pesos
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:34:43
because it was almost 3 weeks that btc did nothing and now with all new noobs in crypto with the weakest hands, they gonna get into the bull run
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:49:57
you know you don't need to buy a whole coin right?
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:35:54
every altcoin guy
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:51:45
people thinking btc is over are just fcking stupid. It's so logical that now dumb money is coming into the crypto and they are buying what is cheap, that's why i think we gonna see trx at .5$ because they don't look at the market cap but once the money stops  coming in, btc will go not to 20k but 40k taking in consideration the total marketcap.
@_date: 2018-01-03 14:42:06
people do only care about making money and not the decentralisation
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:29:21
i don't know why people are worried. Btc will hit 100k$ this year no matter what
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:47:11
guys can we wait with this rocket until i accumulate please?
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:43:32
my technical analysis says it can go either up or down or stay at the same price
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:55:30
yeah but it's gonna be fixed soon so it shouldn't be a problem in a long run
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:50:21
memes could be a new method of payement
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:14:58
wtf? you must be the only one doing that
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:17:36
20k$ at the end of the year is really possible guys
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:50:51
see you at 18k
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:59:38
it 's already dipped now it'll go up
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:28:18
the funny thing is, people are afraid of the bubble and by panic selling they cause it by themselves
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:56:48
maybe he's talking about 0.1$ per micro btc
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:52:11
100k by the end of 2018 is so fcking obvious
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:04:11
better swings of +- 20% than losing 90% in case of bank's bankruptcy
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:47:47
and how do they check your gain with coin to coin trade?
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:03:59
everyone who is scared right now, are the people who are in crypto for one week tops
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:29:11
you buy bitcoin and wait (at least at binance)
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:51:50
we are going down because of lack of memes
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:24:51
90% of people in crypto just want to make money and they don't really care about the technology
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:21:45
for fuck sake ,where is the bear market?
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:40:15
nobody cares about the technology
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:12:40
it's still gonna be over 20k$ someday
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:28:13
in a week it's gonna be 20k$ for sure
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:57:23
it's already a 5 digit value
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:28:31
wait til you die
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:12:45
are you saying you report taxes while trading crypto to crypto?
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:30:51
it's so obvious that nobody has to explain it
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:42:23
i meant the 12 o'clock
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:12:37
btc is for storing a value 
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:26:44
why wait until 12?
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:05:18
why you don't look at ledger's site ?
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:40:24
on binance it's not even at 18k
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:26:38
i don't know how people are still afraid of these dips. There is no way that btc won't be 20k$ at the beginning of 2018
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:33:30
eveything in crypto is a guess
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:01:39
yeah the bubble was at 1k,2k,5k,10k ..... but in reality there is nothing that could stop btc any time soon. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:45:32
how to be a whale:
dump bitcoin ----&gt; pump bcash----&gt; btc margin trading --&gt;
pump bitcoin to the moon ---&gt; MONEY
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:29:02
don't look at price in $
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:25:07
bear market for alts i mean
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:06:14
i sold at 12700, went up to 14500 this is nothing different
@_date: 2018-05-13 21:15:40
vegeta memes incoming
@_date: 2018-06-27 12:49:39
Trx went from 300 to 1100 sats = gains
@_date: 2018-06-27 12:47:45
$100k at the end of the year still holds
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:57:09
nobody cares about the technology xd it's all about us dollars and if btc falls ,all alts will just disappear
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:03:47
btc rush hasn't even started yet
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:05:15
not soon but in 2018 surely it will
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:26:59
it will go down until the 3rd of February and exactly at 6:54 PM, i repeat, 6:54 PM it will bounce back
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:26:37
years xd and within a month bitcoin hits another ath
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:01:18
who da fook is this guy? bcash is just another shitty alt with bitcoin in his name that's all

@_date: 2018-02-02 05:28:32

@_date: 2018-02-05 13:54:29
it's cheap because now there is much more people in crypto than it was when btc was 1k
