Check to see if any shops offer LibertyX in your area. They take debit and cash in person for transactions. Shops set their own rate but the lowest fee in my area is 4%

See if there’s a LibertyX location around you. You can purchase up to $250/day without verifying your ID

Check out upstream data. They are doing some cool mining projects by utilizing stranded natural gas from oil wells that otherwise would be vented or flared off!

Bitcoin is disinflationary until all the coins are mined. At that point btc becomes deflationary from the fact that no new coins can be mined but they can still be lost.

Tip of the day..
Starbucks doesn’t accept hundreds either. If you try to pay with one they just give you the coffee for free. They don’t have enough small bills on hand to break it.

Works best in long lines inside or in the drive through

That’s how it was around the Seattle area to. Then I opened up my shop and undercut everyone at 3.5%. I only get half the fee but if you move volume it adds up

CMC takes an average of all the markets that they cover. In a lot of countries they pay a premium over what blockchain/coinbase list it at. Especially in developing countries where the local currency isn’t as strong.

Don’t be scared to give that dh out there charging 8% some competition..

Solid article. I forgot about seeking alpha but I like how the gather articles about stocks/crypto you’re tracking.

It’s a sign you better get yourself a real bitcoin

If you’re in the US check if LibertyX has a storefront offering their services around you. You’re able to buy with cash and debit. Each store charges a different fee but the one I use is 3.5%. Easy and fast service. You do need to sign up and go through kyc and once passed daily limits of 3k cash/5k debit

Know your customer. Basically uploading your ID and filling out your basic contact info. Any exchange that deals with fiat will ask you nowadays

I mainly check CMC but the spread has been crazy lately. I wouldn’t put it pass CMC to try and manipulate the price after that whole Korea fiasco a few months ago

A bitcoin brokerage in the US. Their business model is basically a human Bitcoin ATM. Stores can sign up to broker bitcoin. Customer come with order numbers and the store collect the cash and puts through the order, then LibertyX sends the BTC. I’ve been working with them as a broker in WA state. It’s nice to earn btc instead of always have to buy them
@_date: 2018-07-03 15:42:02
Im just throwing it out there for anyone who wants to get on their grind. A smart phone and data is all you need to do cash transactions. If you want to take debit you’d need a computer and modem as well.

1.) Buy bitcoin off coinbase, LibertyX, kraken, etc
2.) Transfer Btc to an exchange with tether
3.) buy a stable coin that won’t appreciate and watch the market move
@_date: 2018-07-08 14:16:12
Check for a LibertyX location around you.  You can pass kyc same day you send in docs to have a limit of 3k cash/5k debit per day. Each store sets their own fee. If you’re in WA state let me know. I work with them and we charge 3.5% plus the mining fee
