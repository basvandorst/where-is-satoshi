All subreddits with 100k+ subs have to deal with this kind of spam.
If you're not seeing it as a user it's because the mods of those subreddits are doing a good job.

Check out and  for a good option.
I chose to buy bitcoin directly instead of investing in mining hardware.

Look up pooled mining.
Also, Mining with your CPU is nearly worthless at this point. I wouldn't bother unless you can use a decent GPU.

I'm not sure there's any case that can move enough air to cool 5x 5850 at 100% load indefinitely.

IT'S... exactly 244139.

Fair enough.

[Market Depth]( is what you're looking for.
As of this writing, the lowest Ask is 18.83.  
The resistance to 19.84 is 2100BTC or nearly $41000USD  
The resistance to 30.00 is 18785BTC or nearly $427000USD
The highest bid is 18.73.  
The resistance to 17.71 is 2375BTC or about $43000USD  
The resistance to 14.00 is 9720BTC or about $160000USD
Edit: keep in mind there are plenty of bots that will respond to market-moving orders with orders of their own, so even if someone buys through the entire queue of ask orders, more will pop up to fight the price being set arbitrarily high.

There can only ever be 21 000 000 . 000 000 00 bitcoins with the current system.
It's not implausible that this could become 2 100 000 000 . 000 000 without any real changes to the protocol.

If you had purchased 1000 dollars worth of bitcoins, you would have one million dollars worth of bitcoins.
If you had purchased 1000 bitcoins, you would have 10,000 dollars worth of bitcoins.

To be fair, anyone who picks up an 'el cheapo' power supply to run expensive hardware is asking for trouble. 
If you don't run mud-water through your car engine, why make your electronics use the equivalent?
