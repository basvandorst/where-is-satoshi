There are hundreds of "altcoins" on the market denominated in Bitcoin, and although Bitcoin is volatile, altcoins are even more-so. We profit off this volatility by buying and selling (with Bitcoin) the right altcoins, at the right time. It is extremely risky, and not for the feint of heart, but we have gotten pretty good at it. Does this answer your question?

We have found a lot of people simply do not have the time to monitor the Exchanges/BTT forums/Reddit/Twitter/IRC, etcetera, but want to participate in the crypto-currency markets and have fun while doing it. We created a service for those people. If we create a system where we can trade for you, provide real time record of our trades pulled from exchange APIs, have a chat system where users and others can discuss the trades as they happen, AND we make you some money while doing it, I think 25% off the profits we make for you is reasonable. If we make nothing, we take nothing; its a risk we're willing to take to provide something new and exciting for cryptos.

We are trading altcoins, particularly off the Bittrex exchange, because of its reliability, support and ability to create read-only keys, which allow us to safely display our trades. In laymen's terms, we pool BTC from our users for one month (happening now), and after that month ends, we close deposits and trade the BTC we accumulated for a period of four months (November 1 - February 28). At the end of the four months, we distribute the ending fund balance proportionately to our users.
