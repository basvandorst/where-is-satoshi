Look at the mempool yourself instead of taking a wallet's prediction at face value.  If anyone's being an armchair redditor here, it's yourself.
You can pull about 2000-4000 TX per block, which on average is discovered every 10 minutes.  If you see the current mempool load at like 2000 transactions, you can throw 1 sat/byte at it and likely be confirmed in the next block or two.  Sure, if the chain gets randomly out of nowhere dust attacked, you could be sitting a while or eventually be rejected out of the mempool (no loss aside from time), but you also have the option (with most wallets) to RBF it and bump it up, pay the little extra, and get your confirmation quickly.
Most wallets will currently tell you to pay around 50 sat/byte right now when you can **LITERALLY** pay 1/50 of that and confirm in the next block. That **is** an issue.  Ever thought about the open source projects possibly being funded by miners to pay higher fees?  Not saying that's happening, but it surely is a possibility.  I just think that the prediction could go on the lower side most of the time.
I also advocate for users to know their tech, understand how it works, and to actively play with it.  Fees *do* change, I was simply commenting on my past few days experience VS my wallet's suggestions.

I think that he was talking about telling people that bitcoin was a pyramid scheme which further damages its reputation.  Telling people it's a pyramid scheme is stupid.

No, you can deposit, trade, and withdraw pretty much anything through RUDex or OpenLedger gateways.

Try the subreddit but ONLY TRADE WITH REPUTABLE TRADERS! Also beware of people using similar names of reputable traders. There are some real scammers there but there are some good traders as well.

You can download a lite wallet (means you don't have to download the chain) and import the wallet file into it. Good luck!

This is real crypto.  If you have any questions feel free to ask them and I can elaborate and even give you a free account. You can literally make posts and trade what you're paid out in for Bitcoin.

That's a good one, too.

For mobile, Mycelium is great. For PC try an old version of Multi-Bit, it's very easy to import.
You could also dissect the wallet file (open it in a text editor) and import its private key to pretty much any wallet.

To be honest, I'd really advise against this.  Try Mycelium for mobile, it's really good and simple.  Just make sure to write your seed down and store it in a safe place.
@_date: 2018-10-15 19:41:28
I'd go with something well vetted with a reputable team behind it. I don't know anything about Samurai wallet, myself.

Yes, this. 
ALWAYS trade face to face in safe spots that are very public.  Even in the parking lot of a police station is ideal.

Electrum is solid, yes.  Also consider making and burying some paper wallets :-).
@_date: 2018-10-05 04:16:04
Sounds like you don't really understand how this all works.  To eliminate bitcoin would mean the elimination of all full nodes and no one ever picking it back up, well, or the elimination of the internet itself.
Sure, it isn't fast and cheap.  But I'll be damned if it isn't in the pockets of millions with very vested interests.
@_date: 2018-10-05 04:45:07
Find a reputable local buyer on localbitcoins, most of the time you will find someone that will run you through the motions of how it's all done.  Albeit they're probably going to charge you a cash premium, but probably better than your BTMs.
Also look on [meetup.com]( for local exchange groups, those are sometimes amazing with great communities.
@_date: 2018-10-05 04:49:06
Get off of facebook and onto decentralized social media platforms that cater to people like use that are interested in the space.  I prefer the Steem blockchain for that.  [ is an awesome front-end for that chain.  Of course you have your dummies there, but there are so many intelligent folks on there it's insane.  Be cautious, just like everywhere else on the internet.  But the Steem social media platform is pretty awesome.

Their fee estimate wasn't accurate, I checked the current mempool load and fee structure, used it, and it worked.  Which differed massively from Mycelium's.  Please pull your boner out of your mouth for a moment, we're in public here.  You're a fool.  Please argue with the mempool elsewhere.
@_date: 2019-06-20 01:30:46
You're welcome.  I heard that in Canada there are "anonymous," BTMs, but the fees are 25% (robbery).  I'd suggest going to  and trying to find a crypto or Bitcoin meetup (very common), going there, and asking people if they're selling. I've encountered many old school crypto people will sell to you at market value. True P2P :-).
@_date: 2019-06-20 01:24:08
Yes, and they usually require you to submit your ID and phone number to a random party (that owns the BTM) that you don't know.  I don't like BTMs.  Who knows what they could do with your identity and if they even store the information safely.
@_date: 2019-06-20 03:18:25
You're welcome, just be sure to spread the word so people can more appropriately transact in accordance with the current environment.
You should be golden if you're sending small amounts via lightning!
@_date: 2019-06-20 04:36:34
Because the moment I post on reddit is when I make my transaction?  No.  At this point you just seem like a person that just wants to be right.  I am telling you I sent a bit over 2 hours ago.  Sure, I posted on reddit later (post-transfer) but that isn't my transaction timestamp.
What do I have to gain bullshitting timestamps?  I'm trying to share a resource that actively analyzes the mempool so people can more intelligently see where their transfer may be at any given time.  I have no agenda aside from sharing a helpful tool.
@_date: 2019-06-20 04:21:12
Not really.  At the time, it was 7 sat/byte for a sub 1 hour TX based on the current mempool load, check the history.  What I sent at the moment has confirmed.  Took about 1 hour and 10 minutes.   11.3 x the fees for a few minutes spared?  Lol, no thanks.
@_date: 2019-06-11 21:59:28
You're going to pay fees pretty much anywhere you go.  If you buy from a BTC ATM, you're going to pay like 8%-12% and have to submit your ID and phone number to an unknown third party.  LBC typically has somewhat similar fees.  There's also Mycelium marketplace, but that is sparsely populated.  People trade on too, but be careful on there, lots of scammers.
@_date: 2019-06-11 22:01:14
@_date: 2019-06-20 16:44:46
Sure, but I like bitcoinfees.net since it breaks down the state of the current mempool more precisely.  If you haven't checked it out, I highly recommend it.
@_date: 2019-06-20 01:36:15
Yeah they're everywhere these days.  That's a very good thing, but still the fees are outrageous and insulting.
@_date: 2019-06-20 04:25:33
Sent about 2 hours ago.  Mempool was confirming in sub-hour times at 6 sat/byte (I did 7).  My TX has 1 confirmation.
@_date: 2019-06-20 16:41:08
You have to check the chart at the time and it will show you a better estimation of the time it takes (if you send the TX at that time) for the respective sat/byte fee on the chart.
I sent when the chart was showing 6 sat/byte getting a confirmation in less than 1 hour, but I sent with 7 sat/byte and it took around 1 hour and 10 minutes while my wallet was suggesting around a 79 sat/byte fee labeled as "normal priority," for a 30+ minute confirmation time, that's 11.3x higher than what I could've paid for a similar, but longer, transaction time.

SHA-256 is secure for the time being. But what is nice is the fact that SHA-512 and so on can be implemented as Moore's law progresses.

You can get the pi 3b+ with a case for less than $70 on amazon last i checked.

I think you mean 500GB lol. If you get a 500TB drive, hook me up!
@_date: 2018-12-12 00:56:24
You can get a pi3 b+ in that range. I'd suggest grabbing a cannakit with the case though.
@_date: 2018-12-12 18:46:52
Maybe you need to understand what Moore's law is? It implies that computational power exponentially increases over time, which is what would need to happen in order to break SHA-256. That is all I was saying, as computational power grows, rendering certain algorithms obsolete, those algorithms can be scaled to the point to where the current day's capabilities wouldn't be a threat.
