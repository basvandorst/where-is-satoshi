Okay than you, I'll look into it when I've time 
@_date: 2015-03-25 20:27:17
Ok this seems great and all but I literally know nothing about this field, how can invest? I mean literally, where do I have to go to invest? Paysafe's or something?
 what app/website should I use to check the market economy? 
Where can I learn about index funds? 
Is there a book(s) I must/should read to start understanding economy, and/or investments? 
@_date: 2015-03-25 23:24:20
you seem to know a lot about economics though
@_date: 2015-03-25 19:15:09
I'll follow your tip and make a portfolio, it will be easier for me to find patterns and make better decisions.
How can I understand better Bitcoin? I've only read bitcoins history.. I'll read the side bar's links on how to get started an such.. Is it enough? If not, what else should I read?

Wait wait, if they're inflating to pay the debt they're pretending to pay the debt? Where does the debt come from?
@_date: 2015-03-25 19:22:42
I was the one asking for it :^
Want to make something useful instead of playing video games, glad I completely cut them out last month, feels good
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:34:06
It has happened before, and I doubt Bitcoin will die like this lol; now its value is low I can buy more for less, and it's more probable it will go up than down right? I've little to nothing to lose, if I do. I'm also not going to use all of my money at once (weird english sorry), I'll be reasonable
@_date: 2015-03-25 20:53:52
What is the difficulty in doing so?
@_date: 2015-03-25 22:05:49
Well it can't go lower than zero right? Right guys??
I don't rely on hope...
Whenever Bitcoin was hacked throughout its history it would go very low but then it would come back up... But I don't know the cause of its low value now, why is it getting so low?
@_date: 2015-03-25 18:04:18
I'll read about it thanks
@_date: 2015-03-25 23:09:02
Well Ive spent my last 4 years reading science stuff, now I've no idea what we're talking about, I know absolutely nothing about politics because I hate everything related to it; now I'm trying to learn though 
@_date: 2015-03-25 18:05:54
He trusts me, he knows I won't disappoint him, and I'll do my best to prove him right. 
Bitcoin is a no way to go then?
@_date: 2015-03-25 19:20:30
Just putting the money I have in a bank account and wait is a really bad idea here, some are corrupt and others are going to bankrupt. 
Sad country I live in.. Could be worse though.
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:31:15
Oh ofc Ahahah 
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:13:45
Yeah but I'm not your average 16.. I'm the one telling my parents and not to waste money, usually it's the opposite...
Edit: but I agree with 1000€ is nothing, if I lose it I'll still be able to sleep at night
So should I go for risk investments?
@_date: 2015-03-25 19:28:02
No idea what those sites are, but I'll check them when I've the time, thanks! 
@_date: 2015-03-25 22:33:45
When I've the time I'll check it for sure!
This world is weird.. I had no idea all of this  worked likes this, this definitely has caught my interest...
Also it that why I keep hearing capitalism and democracies are the worse?
@_date: 2015-03-25 22:40:28
I like the first.. The second not sure how it works.. And the third I've heard about it, what's are the pros and cons of the third?
@_date: 2015-03-26 01:32:57
True true :)
@_date: 2015-03-25 19:18:00


Where can I find this kind of info and how do I know the source is trustworthy? 
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:37:10
Huum I had no idea, wow.
If the bubble bursts will actions from companies like McDonalds and Coca-Cola go down a lot? 
And I'm definitely going to talk with my parents and buy some gold and silver, they been wanting to do it but they knew no reason to, now they have
@_date: 2015-03-25 20:52:23
@_date: 2015-03-25 20:20:42
Damn I wanted to tell you stuff but then Id give away obvious information about who I am and lots of friends use reddit, sorry!
But yeah, I realized I didn't win anything at all with games.. I've been exercising and cycling instead and I feel way better with myself, and I'm bout to get a gf! Damn fuck yeah Ahahah
@_date: 2015-03-25 19:11:32
I think I'll buy some bitcoins and index funds; should I use my 1000€ or just half and then use the other half if it goes well?
@_date: 2015-03-25 19:21:10
Why I that so? Does it have to do with mentality?
@_date: 2015-03-25 19:26:35
How can I track the ups and downs the economy, and companies and whatever has? There must be a good mobile app/website for that right?
Also thanks for your response, I'll definitely look into Silver, the preferences here seem like Index funds and Bitcoins, I'll look into other subreddits and see what they have to say, thanks you again.
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:30:46
Don't worry, I'm not going to rush anything
