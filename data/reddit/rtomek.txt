Is it a better idea to pay cash for bitcoin? Of course he is going to use a cc.

That's part of the point of even having exchanges, isn't it? Exchanges should let you short, but you need some kind of collateral. It's just like getting any other type of loan.

HD wallet, so not 6 years old. Probably an “old” wallet but OP would have to check the time stamp of the wallet instead of the screen. Until everything is downloaded and processed, the window shows the most recent transaction processed. No way to know hold old or new this wallet is from the screenshot.

I doubt it will change much. Halving of the BTC reward has less of an effect than a doubling of the difficulty as far as BTC revenue for hashing power. It will just have to be factored in when you do you ROI estimates.

If you follow the trail, there's a bunch of transactions just as large and the mined blocks are all tagged with ghash.io. It's not surprising that someone put a transaction with zero fees in their own block.

There's only an upper limit on block size, not a lower limit.

The law was written to protect low-income people. More than 90% of startups fail, and what you think are big amounts are actually puny amounts for a startup. Even before that law came to pass, it was recommended that startups only search for 'accredited' angel investors with a definition similar to what was incorporated. A startup isn't a traditional investment like the stock market where you can cash out whenever you want, if you're lucky you might be able to cash out in 10-20 years. Besides the large number of investors and the headache that would cause during a Series A, you would have the stress of dealing with investors where you affected their financial stability.
What you're talking about in the edit are angel investment groups. They do exist. I don't think there's any investors (angel or not) that like going in on an investment solo.

Sometimes it is. :/ Better to be down than down and out.

oh god, I completely blocked out the pre-AOL 3.0 days. Back when the big rivals were Prodigy and Compuserve... But that's kind of how most/all consumer dial-up was back then, before http became mainstream.
Edit: Also, as far as being a "late innovation" - I'm pretty sure that AOL became dominant because they were the first of the major online service providers to actually provide a direct connection to the Internet.

It wasn’t a walled garden, you could access any website by typing in the address. It had the most reliable high-speed (48k+) dial-up numbers in my area. Once you were connected, you could minimize the AOL window and open up internet explorer or Netscape. Broadband access is what really did them in, along with every other dial-up service provider, which would mean every digital coin is going to be rapidly made obsolete by something that is only now being researched - if aol is a shitcoin.
