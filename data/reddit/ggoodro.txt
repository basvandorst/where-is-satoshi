I just, LAST NIGHT, decided I would try and see what the feasibility of mining would be, since I have a 1080 GPU. I researched a bit, checked here on Reddit and some other places and determined that NiceHash was legit enough to give it a whirl for a day or two and see what kind of throughput I could get. I started the mining at about 1:30 AM, saw maybe 10 cents of mining activity kick in and thought, hey cool, I'll see how this goes. Went to bed, wake up 6 hours later...no GPU whirring...try to log in...CAN'T LOG IN! I started to freak out thinking they hacked me the moment I locked my screen or something...had to go to work, so just shut the system down and tried not to think about it all day. Fast forward to this evening...turn on my PC, log in without any issue...must have been me mistyping in the dark too many times for the trouble in the morning. My system comes up, my browser windows restore to their last pages and I see the NiceHash workers status page up with the news of their breach. WOW!!!! What a wild situation. I'm not 100% comfy with what the status of my own system might be after an event like this. For the moment I've changed passwords and monitored for any strange activity, and so far seem to be clean. Over the next couple of days I'm going to rebuild my PC just to make sure. I try to do it once a year just to keep things cleaned up and high performance, so this kind of forces me to do it. I know that getting into Bitcoin is like being on a rollercoaster, but didn't know that my very first attempt at some kind of mining was going to be even more intense. Again, just WOW!
