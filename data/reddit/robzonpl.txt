Right, the original 133MB estimate assumes 2 channels per year per person. Might be too low, might be too high. Hopefully we'll find out soon enough! :-)

AND uses SHA256.
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:37:13
Just to add more detail...
The 133MB block estimate is for the case when 7 billion people use BTC every day. We're very far from that demand. With what's available today (we could easily get to ~2MB average block capacity), we can hook up 7*10^9 / (133/2) ~= 100 million people. That can be further optimized with signature aggregation, payment channel factories, etc.
Pretty exciting stuff. 2018 is gonna be awesome!

In terms of KYC/AML, running a LN node is no different than running a Bitcoin node. In LN you never have custody of other user's funds, you're simply relaying transaction data. Also, nodes don't even know whose funds they're relaying and to whom, they only know the previous and the next hop.

Depends on how you measure success.
If you're feeling adventurous you can already use LN, but there are still many bugs to address and if you run into issues you're on your own.
Being close to LN development, my best guess is it'll be safe to use for most users by the end of Q2.

I'm assuming for the block to be valid and accepted by network, the minimum fee value must be real (ie. going through all transactions in the block looking for smallest fee would have to give the same result). The only thing that would change is that SPVs would have a reliable way to determine what the minimum fee within the block really is. This change would be redundant for all other players.

Yes, where/when you're born has a huge impact on your life. My parents are one of those who worked crappy minimum wage jobs and on top of that lost a lot of money due to bad luck. Things were very difficult for most of my life yet I never felt I was in any way entitled to help from other people. I had less than my peers. A damn bottle of coke used to be a big deal for me. The cheapest bike from the store was all I could dream of. Later I had to work to afford my tuition. Again, never used my unlucky background as an excuse for anything. Never complained others had it easier.
World sucks, there's a lot of entropy and a random event can change your life forever. That doesn't mean you can blame those more fortunate or expect them to help you out. I'd rather have Dan Bilzerian's lavish life than mine, but that doesn't mean I feel like he should be obliged to help me or anybody else.
We're not entitled to anything just because we were born. I absolutely love when people help other people, but it has to be out of their own will and never mandated from the top. Guys like Pineapple Fund have much, much more respect than fraudulent taxes governments impose on society.

What gives anyone the right to expect something from other people?


No, they get the wealth because their parents worked hard and made good decisions, not just because they were born.
Look at it from a parent's perspective. You want only the best for your kids. You've sacrificed your whole life by working extremely hard so that your kids can get a good start in their lives and not have to go through the hell you've been through. Other parents around you have made poor choices, were slacking off, etc.
Now your kids are grown up and society wants to rob them of your gift to them and distribute it to others. How is that fair?

Some good points there!
How about the scenario where a malicious actor (likely state sponsored) gains exclusive access to QC months before honest miners do?
They'd effectively be able to destabilize the whole network for months, which would in turn effectively kill Bitcoin altogether. How can we make this scenario completely impossible?
@_date: 2018-05-26 21:12:40
Agreed. Except PoS :)
I'm open to changing my mind, but as of now I think PoW works great *because* it incurs an actual cost in the physical world. An attacker would have to suffer the same physical costs, whereas with PoS there might be no such cost at all.
The ideal situation would be if all energy on Earth was completely green and Bitcoin took a large enough share of it to make it unfeasible to perform 51% attack by doubling network's hashrate.
That obviously doesn't address other attack vectors like capturing most of the existing hashrate.

Well, if there was a ban on crypto in a country you wouldn't pay with it in a grocery store. You would either trade it for cash on the black market (like what's going on now in Venezuela) or use it as your flight capital to move to a different country.

I'd say that the guy just wants to promote Bitcoin and knows that still very few clients will pay in btc, so it won't affect his gross profit margins.
I'm sure once more people start using btc for payments he won't be *that* generous anymore.

To be honest that's the most important threat I see that definitely won't solve itself. There's a good chance that other issues will sort themselves out free-market style (mining hw competition seems to be growing), but quantum computers are something we need to be proactive about.
I'm not familiar enough with quantum tech to definitely say how badly they affect SHA-256, so I'd defer that to others. As far as I know we should be concerned.
There's an argument that quantum tech is still a long time away, my counterarguments are:
* We need to be ready long BEFORE that happens to avoid the disruption of the global financial system
* The change will require a hard fork, and hard forks should be planned YEARS ahead to minimize risks
* Bitcoin is designed to last centuries or even millennia, QC's timelines are MUCH shorter, so the issue is inevitable anyways
Again, I'm not 100% sold on PoW change myself, but I would LOVE to have an honest, open discussion about future threats. We have plenty of time to have these discussions now, without rushing, without being dismissive and without time pressure that could lead to making commitments too early. If we wait until the threat becomes reality it might be too late.

Yep, it's exciting, but as far as I know, we still don't have quantum-ready range proofs, so that might delay things significantly.
@_date: 2018-05-26 20:37:57
PoW change might be a good idea, but I still think we don't understand the issue deeply enough. I'd wait until we have a very high level of confidence that such change is needed and, more importantly, what's the best PoW (why?) and deployment path.
@_date: 2018-05-21 14:31:27
I'm on the same page. After many years in the space I'm more convinced than ever that only Bitcoin matters in the long-term.
We might see some other blockchain-based networks that are better than Bitcoin in very specific contexts (and those would most likely benefit from being a sidechain to Bitcoin), but nothing will take Bitcoin's place as the global open financial network.

I don't think I'm an exception, I think short-term traders are just much more visible on social media, because a) that's what they do all day b) they react/talk much more about short-term news.
You're right, it is a very vague prediction (I wouldn't call it a prediction though since there's no measurable target or time frame). Overall I think your cautiousness (even if excessive) is much better than blind optimism, but I wouldn't ignore these opinions either. The sentiment behind these opinions (along with person's background) can be very telling and over time you'll be able to tell who's worth listening to and who's not.

They *could* be complementary if only they'd solve any issue significantly better than bitcoin. And no, shorter block time and different hashing algorithm is not a significant improvement.
Personally I'm all for more cryptocurrencies as long as they bring in additional, unique value.

It's not really about what miners want, it's about what's the best for network as a whole. I'm not convinced and not advocating for a change, but it's worth exploring on a deeper level. I believe once it's obvious (if ever) that such a change is needed, miners won't oppose either.

To be fair, "bcash" was just a push back to Roger's scammy behavior. If it wasn't for him, nobody would use that name. Nobody is using "bgold", "bdiamond" or "bprivate".

If you employ 1000+ people at average $3000 per month, you get $3m * 0.17% = $5100 per month of additional revenue.
Not sure if it's considerable money for a 1000+ person company.
@_date: 2018-05-13 22:13:22
Yes, as supply of USD grows over time due to inflation while supply of BTC stays the same, there are more dollars per bitcoin in circulation and bitcoin appreciates against the dollar.
(Since we're talking about inflation I assumed constant ratio of purchasing power of all supply)

So I've used Google Wallet to do exactly that - it's compatible with any Paypass/Paywave terminal. The only problem is Google Wallet works only in the US, where contactless payments are a rarity. Here, in Poland, where pretty much every merchant has a contactless terminal, we can't use Google Wallet, which sucks.
Also Wallet hides your actual CC number behind their virtual CC numbers to give you additional data protection. Too bad Google is too US-centric to notice that it would be a huge hit in countries like Poland.

Because the price is not important to the technology itself. Sure, lots of users can get discouraged, but it's not like all those Bitcoin startups which got hundereds of millions of dollars pumped into them are gonna disappear. The technology and infrastructure are there, marketing budgets are there, it's not gonna disappear, becuase of something everyone was well aware of - extreme volatility.

Slowly getting there, I've already moved most of my finances to crypto, but not 100% yet.
Plan for this year is to go 100% crypto for all my personal spendings and if it works well for a full year, get rid of bank accounts altogether in 2019.
Spending is quite easy (especially with OneBit card), but there are some exceptions like Uber - I just cannot get it to work with Bitcoin. Also getting paid regularly with Bitcoin might be tricky, but totally doable.

@_date: 2015-01-15 19:49:21


How can you tell? I'm not saying it's not true, but I think that it's entirely possible that what we have now is a makeshift infrastructure and once we come up with proper solutions we'll look back at the current state with a smirk and nothing more.
EDIT: Also I'm not sure Bitcoin will survive as a consumer-fronting product. It's also very possible that we'll see great services and products that rely on Bitcoin under the hood, but users never really see it. Kinda like web, it relies on TCP, but your average Joe has no idea what TCP is.

On the bright side - it's still a regular bitcoin qr code, so best case scenario I get to pay with bitcoin, worst case scenario I go through the refund process again, which is a cost *they* need to take (in form of customer support cost AND damaging relationship with Bic Camera) while not making any money on commission.

Not really, with paper wallets the private key is in plain sight, not so much with Trezor. Unless you use BIP38, but then again if you use passphrase on Trezor you get the same increase in security. So even if this was left unpatched it would still be more secure than paper wallets.

Of course it does. It might not be a single person, but a small group of people that effectively act as a CEO. You cannot create more gold or bitcoin out of thin air, you can only mine what's left of the unmined supply. Fiat has limitless supply over which 99.999% of the world has absolutely no control nor influence.

Ok, let's think about this for a second. Currently you need to pay about 200 SAT/b to feel confident your tx will be confirmed. Simple tx is about 250 bytes. So a tx costs 500 bits, which is worth about $2.10.
Since BTC is only a speculative asset (meaning not actually used as a currency at all) you only use it to:
1. Transfer USD to an exchange
2. Exchange USD to BTC
3. Transfer BTC out of an exchange
Step 1 costs you whatever your bank charges you. Step 3 costs you $2.10. Now step 2...
Typically an exchange will charge you something like 0.25% per order (ie. Bitstamp, Poloniex, Kraken). If you invest even a small amount, say, $5000 that's a $12.5 fee. Now does the $2 in BTC fees really make any difference from an investor's standpoint?
In context of speculative assets, BTC tx fee is negligible.
@_date: 2018-10-09 17:29:53
Why would you do this manually? It's easy enough to integrate with bitcoind to automate the whole process.

On-chain tx fees will never be low enough to use it as a currency, it's just impossible to fit tens of thousands of txs per second in a highly-redundant distributed network at a cost comparable to VISA tx...
@_date: 2018-10-20 03:42:02
A non-listening node will connect to several listening nodes and still rely blocks between them. It will also still verify the blocks for its owner.
The only downside is they need to be the active party in establishing a connection, which is fine as long as we have enough listening nodes in the network overall.
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:20:44
Very true, this is quite technical and needs to be hidden from the regular user.
Unfortunately I can't help you with any recommendations. This problem surfaced just recently since value of Bitcoin went up. Previously fees were low enough most people just ignored this. I'm sure wallets will implement some user-friendly strategies to deal with this issue, but I'm not aware of any that already have.
On the plus side, this is not a very common occurrence. This only happens if you do a lot of small transactions to an address, never spend anything from that address, and then do a big transaction from that address that covers many of the incoming UTXOs.
The easiest thing to do right now, would be to transfer all your funds to a new address with a low fee (probably as low as 10 SAT/b would work) and wait a few hours/days. This will force your wallet to consolidate all UTXOs to a new address. This can be done with any wallet that lets you control transaction fees.

Lightning Network is not a sidechain
@_date: 2017-08-07 20:03:52


My best guess - to not make it painfully obvious they're conducting an attack (if it's even an attack).


Just thought the same thing, this seems to be the most efficient way to introduce a lot of noise to fee estimation. It's also not as obvious - to detect this someone would have to monitor for txs that are included in blocks but were never broadcasted to the network. Detectable, but stealthy.
@_date: 2018-10-08 10:54:09


This cannot be overstated. On the plus side this experience motivates me to work harder on solving these issues!
@_date: 2017-01-16 16:09:14
This is probably the best way to start. Most people would just assume their Bitcoin got stolen if all funds were moved to a different place and not even bother to look for posts like these. Moving a tiny amount might alert the owner that something is wrong and prompt them to take action.
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:48:47


Yes, and that's how it should be.
With 25bil transactions per day, at 250 bytes per transaction, you get 72MB of raw tx data per second. That's one way. If you receive that data and forward it to 3 peers, that makes 288MB of data per second, so about 2.3Gbps.
I just don't see that a regular home would ever need a connection that can easily handle steady 2.3Gbps (up to 10Gbps during peak hours?) of data without impairing regular usage and still not kill all possible monthly data caps. Not because technology cannot keep up, but why would there be a demand for 10Gbps home internet with no data caps if a 4K stream is 1/400 of that?

No, it would not be different. People and the economy define the currency, not PoW algorithm. The 51% attack is a big deal, because it can disrupt the network on a tech level, not because whoever owns &gt;50% owns the economy.

Never heard of LN taking power from miners, maybe UASF?
All LN does is gives bitcoin secure, instant and cheap transactions. This can be done by not including every tx in a block, but by keeping score off-chain in a cryptographically secure way and only periodically settling balances on the blockchain. All that at tens of thousands of transactions per second.

SegWit is backward-compatible and did not cause any disruption to the stability of the network. All network participants finally agreed to activate it (though it took about a year). It did not even cause a hard fork. 
BCH is another good example - they changed the rules and implemented safety measures. They performed a hard fork without disrupting the existing network.
2X seems to be openly hostile.

@_date: 2017-08-25 14:19:35
Well, we already know on-chain is never gonna work for many thousands of transactions per second, so the real world adoption cannot happen without 2nd layer solutions anyways.
For now, most merchants will convert BTC to fiat instantly, since volatility is too high to risk keeping BTC, especially for low-margin businesses.
Some businesses might end up having to consolidate UTXOs every now and then, but this again, happens only if a business accumulates a lot of incoming transactions (as in number of txs not their total value) and then spends them all at once, which again isn't that common.
And finally, such consolidation is not THAT big of a deal, for now it's mostly a minor annoyance. Speaking as someone who owns a business accepting BTC :-)
EDIT: Oh, and I forgot to mention, thanks to SegWit, such transactions with many inputs will get significantly smaller and cheaper. So things should get much better over the coming months once more wallets support this tech.
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:31:04
Hmm I'd imagine LN nodes would form a rather dense graph, meaning there would be many routes between any two nodes. Only end users (analogous to SPV wallets) would open only a single channel with an "exit" node, but they are not strategic and could easily switch nodes in case of any issues. Dense network would  allow channel balancing algorithms, which would greatly reduce the frequency of opening/closing channels. That's an incentive for node operators to have multiple channels with smaller capacity rather than just a few channels with large capacity.
This is one of those things you just need to try to see if it works. I really hope LN will do the trick, it's the only known solution that could scale to tens of thousands tps at a minimal cost.

If you look at BTC as purely speculative asset, then denominating fees is USD makes sense. Otherwise it's like saying block reward is $52000.

Well I'm not saying small businesses should implement the integration themselves, that's like asking them to build their own credit card terminal. As the market grows we'll see more boxed products that a small shop can buy and set up with just a few clicks while never giving up the control of their private keys. Just because you're using 3rd party software doesn't mean you have to have 3rd party custody of your money.
A good analogy would be cash registers. You buy a product (cash register) that helps you handle the cash yourself. Once it's set up you don't rely on 3rd party to accept payments.
BTCPay is kinda headed that way. It's a huge step forward, but it's not the end of the road.

It's not a monopoly market.
LN nodes are permissionless, anyone can set up a LN node at very little cost and they don't have to ask for permission. You can set up one of your own and let everyone use it and nobody can stop you from doing so. This contradicts the very definition of monopoly.
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:19:25
LN doesn't solve that problem, the thread was about a single miner owning vast majority of BCH hash power, effectively making it easy for him to perform 51% attack and censor transactions.
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:16:36
I think the seed is based on a BIP39 wordlist, which is limited to basic 2048 words, so you only get 11 bits of entropy per word. I think you could squeeze an extra 4 bits if you include uncommon words, so 4 words would have up to 60 bits of entropy combined. This sounds like enough to at least buy you enough time to comfortably move funds.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:56:18
Don't worry, there are solutions to everything, we just need time to implement them. You'd be surprised how much weird, legacy stuff is included in every CPU, or how messed up and convoluted credit/debit card system is, yet it works for vast majority of people.

I think off-chain is the only way to go. On-chain tx will never be fast enough (no way to get to ~1s conf time) and storing even 250 bytes of data for "eternity" with very high redundancy is never going to be cheap enough for bitcoin to be used as an everyday currency.
LN is a first attempt at it (I'll be running a node myself soon to test it), but I expect we will see more interesting solutions in L2.

Confirmation times would double until next readjustment. I'd say this isn't nearly enough to get people to leave. 10 min block time is way too long to pay for "coffee" anyways, any other transactions are not that time sensitive.

@_date: 2017-08-25 12:52:53
This is how Bitcoin works under the hood. Every transaction creates a UTXO (unspent transaction output) for an address. If you want to spend money from that address, you need to use UTXOs from that address. So if you have a lot of small UTXOs at an address, say $1 each, and then you want to spend $1000, then you need to include 1000 UTXOs from that address in the transaction, which makes a transaction really big (in terms of bytes). Since fees are per byte, such transaction will be very costly.
The best thing to do here is consolidate all UTXOs with a low-fee transaction. Sure, it might take many hours, days even for the consolidation to be confirmed, but once you do that, you're back to normal fees.

Interpretation of the points:
1. **Protocol is the core product.** Bitcoin is not an app, it's a protocol. There's a "reference implementation", but it's just a byproduct of what's being done. It's the idea that matters, not the app. Somewhat similar to Torrent in this regard.
2. **No single point of failure.** Many implementations help prevent single point of failure. If we had just one implementation and a 0-day vulnerability got exploited in the wild it would get very, very ugly. Multiple implementations benefit the community by reducing the risk of everything being brought down by a single bug.
3. **Variety of ideas.** Having many teams working independently will help drive development in many directions at a time and come up with a variety of solutions for emerging issues. Kinda like crowdsourcing problem solving.
4. **Democracy (sort of).** There's no single team/person that has the final say in what goes. Whole community gets to decide by their contribution to the network.
Now what would happen if we skipped any of the points:
1. Without this point we'd end up with majority of population incorrectly associating Bitcoin with this one particular app from this one particular website. Putting an "official" tag on the app would artificially boost its credibility even if much better implementations existed. We don't want to bias users' choices.
2. Without this point we'd have a single implementation and bet the security/integrity of the whole network on a single implementation. Looking at history this could be disastrous.
3. Without this one everybody would be following the same path, every implementation would be headed in the same direction, etc. We would not have alternative, competing solutions to emerging issues. And where there's no competition there's hardly any innovation.
4. Without this one we would end up with a centralized authority, a single dev or team which would dictate the direction of the whole network. Sooner or later this approach would cause only a very narrow group of "leaders" to benefit from the development of Bitcoin, instead of the whole community.
I do feel like there's only a thin line between these points and differences are quite subtle. They all address the same issue (centralization and the trust associated with it), but from different perspectives.

Yes, you get both BTC and S2X. As for the second question...
Normally, the party that's initiating the fork (by changing consensus rules) would also implement something called "replay protection", which makes a transaction valid on one chain but not valid on the other. In those cases you can safely spend both coins independently of each other.
Unfortunately Bitcoin2X guys refuse to implement such protection in an attempt to hijack Bitcoin brand. That means if you spend your coins on one chain, someone could easily copy that transaction to the other chain without your consent. Because of this, wallet software needs to implement workarounds to prevent replays from happening. This is a bit tricky and how it's done will depend on the particular wallet. It's best to just wait for a couple of days after the fork and let wallet developers sort out all the issues. Your coins will be safe that way.

Yes toxicity is prevalent, and it's bad, but it will blow over. In the meantime consider this...
You don't see people here shit over, say, XMR. That's because XMR brings something new to the table and doesn't attack Bitcoin while pretending to *be* Bitcoin. We have a lot of respect for people like who, by the way, is [actively helping Bitcoin]( while still leading the development for a different coin!
If only BCH creators had that much integrity and pure intentions there would be no toxicity at all.
And all this toxicity is built upon a bogus claim that adjusting a single constant (that's changing **one number**) in Bitcoin's code will solve extremely difficult scalability issues that's been a hot topic among highly-skilled developers for years. Let that sink in.

Depends on the loan, but generally I don't think it's a good idea. It's still a high risk asset and while things look pretty good, there's still some chance it will crash further and stay down for quite a while.
If you really feel comfortable/want to take the risk, get **at most** a loan for 12 months with $100/month installments. This way you can place a bet at the current price while staying at the $100/month schedule.

It's a great time to start accumulating bitcoin, but:
* Do not expect the price to go up in January. It might take many months before we see a new bullish trend. Do not overbuy if you think you might need to use that money in the near future.
* Cost average. Buy smaller amounts at weekly/monthly intervals, over a period of several months. This will give you the average buying price for that period and a peace of mind.
* If you  haven't already - take your time to read up on Bitcoin and Austrian economics. The Bitcoin Standard is also a great read. Do a lot of research and learn as much as you can.

It's fast enough, privacy has been improving greatly (and continues to be improved) and price is an awkward thing to point out. What's the "right" price of any asset? It is what it is because the free market has decided so.

It's gonna work for them just fine, why wouldn't it? The only people it's not gonna work for is the short-term gains crowd.
Remember Bitcoin is not a product, so it cannot go bankrupt. It's an open protocol that products can freely use. Bitcoin doesn't have marketing budgets, just like TCP/IP doesn't. TCP/IP was there long, long before Google, Amazon or Facebook.
Whether 1 bitcoin is priced at $1 or at $100000 doesn't change absolutely anything product-wise. It's the product that delivers value to the market, not Bitcoin itself. It's Google that solves real-life issues, not TCP/IP. Of course we need TCP/IP for Google to work, just like we need LN/BTC protocol stack for the upcoming products.
By buying and holding bitcoin, you only express a belief that the Bitcoin protocol is going to facilitate next-gen financial products, that are gonna reshape the world of finance just like the Internet has reshaped the world of information.

Of course they can. Many companies went bankrupt during the dotcom bubble. But that's not relevant to Bitcoin at all. Bankrupt companies didn't make TCP/IP suddenly stop working.
Also, serious companies tend to have many years of runway and I doubt there are many companies that store 100% of their funding in bitcoin. Even if you're very idealistic about money you need to manage the volatility risk somehow, otherwise it's just irresponsible.
My team is funded in our local fiat currency. We're building software that will help bring bitcoin closer to the mainstream, but we really don't care what the exchange rates will be at launch, it's absolutely irrelevant. Our software will be just as usable and will work just as well regardless of the exchange rate. It will be ready when it's ready, and frankly I don't care that the dip might last another year. There are much more important things at stake than getting rich quick.

I don't think this solves the problem, since:
1. Using a different chain introduces a new token, which inflates money supply, which kills the benefit of fixed, predictable money supply.
2. It introduces conversion rate risk, since there's no way to peg the value of 2 independent tokens.

That's a really good high-level explanation of the concept, thanks!
I need to get into the implementation details though. One potential downside I see is that it might get unreasonably expensive to join the inner network, unless you can find enough participants to share the cost of creating the intermediate cryptosystem (channel factories). For sure it sounds like this could reduce the number of on-chain state updates, but I don't yet see how this would be a whole order of magnitude.

Oh I agree that there's a ton of work to be done before Bitcoin can be used as a currency. It's gonna take years to get there on a very bumpy road. There's gonna be a lot more price swings, rallies, crashes, bad news, good news, trolls and scammers.
I don't know if you know/remember that in 90's most of the time you had to fiddle with modem's AT commands to get online. Back then we were setting up multi-link dial ups (as in using 2 phone lines at the same time) just to get over the 56kbps limit. Downloading an mp3 file usually took longer than the duration of the sound.
I remember when RealPlayer first came out and there was some video content for streaming in extremely crappy quality (like crappy codecs that had to work on a 56kbps link). I was telling everyone that some day we're all gonna be watching movies via the Internet. People laughed at me and ridiculed the idea. 20 years later Netflix surpasses cable subscribers.
Back then Internet's usability was an absolute nightmare. Have you ever used IRC? Today it's mostly used by FOSS projects, back then it was used by everybody.
Bitcoin is extremely young. UX is crap, it's volatile and doesn't scale well. You could say the same thing about the Internet in the 90's. Fortunately that didn't stop people from solving these issues despite Internet being called a fad and, famously, having no more impact that a fax machine.

Sure! It comes down to buying small amounts on a regular basis as opposed to buying a larger amount in one shot. So as the price fluctuates your buying price averages over time. For example instead of buying btc for $10k in one shot you could buy $1k worth of btc every week over a period of 10 weeks. During bear markets like this one, your average buying price goes down with every time. The downside is that your average buy price might go up if the market trend reverses, but we have yet to see any signs of trend reversal.
IMHO it's an optimal strategy especially when spread out over many months,

Exactly! The problem is government is a monopoly and lacks competition. The incentive here is to steal from tax payers and abuse power and such centralization cannot avoid this fate. The only way to prevent such fraud is to have accountability and competition, which means moving all government services to free market.
Personally I'd rather be "robbed" by a company on the free market than the government.

True, but also I do not believe less than 1% of users, who happen to control the vast majority of hashrate, represent all Bitcoin users. NYA is bullshit, because Bitcoin is NOT a democracy. Nobody represents my views, I represent them myself by running a full node that follows the rules I agreed to.
I've had to jump through a lot of hoops to make my life fiat-free and opposing unwanted change in consensus rules will be just another one on the long list.
This is the beauty of Bitcoin though, conflicts are solved by actual use, not by some actors claiming to speak for the rest of the community. Also that's what makes Bitcoin decentralized - every peer has the exact same rights and speaks for itself. Make any changes to the protocol you want, I'll stand my ground and follow what **I believe is right**.

Software Engineer here. It's a bad analogy because a hard fork is a very different animal than horizontal scaling in the cloud. The main argument against block size increase is not the increase itself, but a risky hard fork. It's just better to wait until we have more pending changes that require a hard fork and bundle them together. In other words we want to minimize risk by minimizing the frequency of HFs. In the meantime there is plenty of room for improvement without hard forks.
@_date: 2017-09-07 20:51:15
I think people who go out of their way just to pay with Bitcoin over fiat would not mind somewhat higher fees, or at least would be more patient. Especially the long-term hodlers, who made multiple-hundred or -thousand percent returns would not mind paying even 2-3% tx fees for a while if it's good for Bitcoin long-term.
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:18:53
It should matter to you at least a little. Bitcoin's success heavily depends on decentralization (ie. making it feasible/affordable to run a full node by as many people as possible) and stability (well engineered, secure and tested code) of the network. If we fail to defend these properties, we might just as well go back to fiat.
@_date: 2017-09-22 19:17:53


There's no room for "think" when you handle multi-billion dollar market. Only hard data matters. And proving such change is safe is the responsibility of the entity which wants to introduce the change. This should be done via extensive testing and simulations, not a rushed unjustified hard fork. Besides we just had a substantial block capacity increase via SegWit.
I'm all for another block size increase whenever these conditions are met:
- other, safer scaling options are exhausted
- block size increase code has been extensively tested, reviewed and has been running on testnet for a while
- there are no opposing voices in the community, especially from experienced developers
Realistically these could be met some time in 2018. For now I don't see the point since:
- my 10 SAT/b txs go through without any issues
- doubling the block size is way too little to have any significant impact on scaling (we need 1000x more capacity to match VISA)
- knowing that this hard fork is contentious, not implementing a replay protection is a malicious act and I will not support it

That's very broad and generic. Not sure if the guy who paid 10k BTC for two pizzas did it because he saw a way to make money. Yet it was a huge milestone for the community.
I pulled the trigger relatively late, but still got in sub-$100. I promoted the shit out of BTC and got a few businesses in my city to accept BTC. Never thought/said anything about the price, it was all about freedom and sovereignty at the time. These business owners were shocked when BTC went up by 50%.

@_date: 2017-09-25 02:03:16
I think both sides have a valid point.
On one hand Bitcoin wouldn't be able to handle the amount of transactions Amazon processes daily. It wouldn't be able to handle even 1% of that.
On the other hand it doesn't have to. There aren't that many Bitcoin *users* (traders don't count, most of them are here to "cash out") and even if Amazon starts taking Bitcoin, which I very much doubt, there would be only a small bump in Bitcoin transactions. Traffic would definitely increase over time, legitimize the currency, etc but we'd still have plenty of time to work on LN or whatever solution gives us a 1000x capacity increase.
And Bitcoin debit card doesn't count, you still depend on legacy banking system, still have to do KYC/AML, you can still be denied service by MC/VISA, and the merchant has no clue Bitcoin is involved. The upside is you only top up your card with what you need to spend, so you're still in control of your money.

As far as I know Bitcoin Gold is doing it right - they're not hostile and won't cause any disruption to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:00:35
Ah, I see. Totally agreed.
By business transactions I meant B2B, where you'd typically rely on 1-3 day bank wires, so waiting a couple of hours with BTC is already an upgrade.
For coffee yeah, no way in hell to wait a couple of hours, but to be honest even 10 min is too long. Especially that it's not stable 10 min, sometimes there's a 40-min gap between blocks. So even if you'd have guarantee that your transaction will get confirmed in the next block, that's still way too long of a wait for daily stuff. We need Layer 2 anyways.

Don't want to be mean, but I miss those times when speculation was only a small part of the Bitcoin community. It was mostly people who actually believed in the cause and understood the values behind it. Our definition of "cashing out" was to convert all USD to BTC. Sometimes I think Bitcoin would be much better off if it wasn't for people who treat it as a purely speculative asset.

What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:55:25


Yes, but VISA is not a good benchmark. It's just one provider for cards and Bitcoin covers many more use cases (bank wires, VISA, MC, etc) and a whole new market (microtransactions). Arbitrarily setting upper tps cap by what VISA does today makes no sense. I'd argue that for Bitcoin to fulfill its potential 10000x increase is the absolute minimum, probably much more over time.
Being able to easily run a full node by network participants is what gives Bitcoin strength. Without it, we're back to centralized model, which is the exact opposite of why we're here.

The biggest issue would be interplanetary mining. If Mars had no miners, the only difference would be that a) Martian txs would be hitting miners with a delay; b) blocks would arrive on Mars with a delay.
It would take longer to open/close LN channels, but local LN network (or other future L2 solutions) would still be blazing fast.
For large transactions an additional hour of delay for on-chain transactions wouldn't really matter.
@_date: 2017-09-20 02:17:34
I share your optimism, but... For now it's only a theoretical solution. It's very promising, but definitely not proven yet.
@_date: 2017-10-09 17:00:23
Why not? At 100k USD/BTC with 1 SAT/B fees a simple transaction (250 bytes) would translate to just 0.25 USD/tx. Of course that's just an optimal case, but it's possible even with current tech. With upcoming changes txs will get smaller, block capacity is already growing and payment channels could drastically improve things, but that's to be seen.
EDIT: There's also a possibility my math is off.
@_date: 2018-02-19 18:44:45
Well that's for them to decide.
@_date: 2018-02-18 19:09:30
It's already implemented and already being used on mainnet at a small scale. Now all we need is time to thoroughly test it and develop more wallets and infrastructure. I'd be surprised if we don't see an easily installable LN wallet by the end of Q2.
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:46:54
Yeah, let me clarify. Single implementation is tied to the platform it's built for. As technology advances, new operating systems, platforms and languages are developed. It's very limiting for such network to not be able to take advantage of these advances.
It's fine to have a single implementation in the early years, but I doubt Bitcoin Core will be sufficient in 30-50 years.
@_date: 2017-09-25 02:31:47
Ah, I thought you were referring specifically to Venezuela, not to hyperinflation countries in general. My bad.
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:56:24
Ah, but stock is a very different animal. Stocks are not censorship-resistant. They're not programmable. They're tied to their issuer's performance. They will disappear along with its issuer. They're not decentralized. Supply is not capped. You have to sell stock at some point. Nobody will accept stock as payment.
Bitcoin is much more like gold, except it has a perfectly capped supply and is digital. It's the first scarce digital resource.
Holding in the context of Bitcoin is a totally different term than in the context of stocks.

@_date: 2017-10-24 19:26:01
I can't believe so many people here don't get this. Bitcoin was designed to be decentralized, unregulated (and even unregulatable!) and almost a definition of free market. This is where its value and strength come from.
I blame the new wave of traders, who don't know/care about anything else but making easy money.

So tell me again, how many people signed the agreement?
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:19:40
It's a bit tricky, because Segwit transactions are weighed differently than legacy transactions. In best case scenario Segwit can theoretically have 3.8MB blocks, but that's not gonna happen in practice. What we can realistically expect though is average block size in 2-3MB range.
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:05:14
Let's not forget about that. Bitcoin holds its value, because your sovereignty is guaranteed by the software you run.
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:29:06
Sorry to hear that. Extent of what you can do in such situations will heavily depend on the country and value of the transaction.

@_date: 2017-10-16 17:27:49
Do you think this scenario is even realistic? Would an average person be able to adapt? Is access to smartphones/internet easy and widespread enough for this to happen? What would need to happen to speed up Bitcoin adoption?
@_date: 2017-10-20 11:48:00
Short version is because we need to scale by a factor of at least 10000x to handle 'coffee transactions' around the world. If we wanted to scale on-chain only, it would mean:
* 10 GB blocks every 10 min, 1.4TB of new data daily
* about 800 mbps internet connection required _just for a node_
* powerful CPU just to verify blocks required
* mempool could grow to tens of GBs
* UTXO set would grow to tens of GBs
That would exclude everyone but the richest from running a node. [Moore's Law]( doesn't work anymore, so it's not gonna save us.
Also, SegWit **is** a block-size increase to about 4MB. Most mined blocks are over 1MB now and steadily increasing. SW adoption is at [16% now]( so there's plenty of room to grow, too.
With 4MB blocks and LN we will be able to scale big without making Bitcoin cost a fortune to use.

I'd argue here. There were times when people talked mostly about technology, legal risks and adoption. Even a small cafe accepting bitcoin was a big deal. We were still too shy to even dream of chain stores (like Bic camera) dipping their toes in Bitcoin. People did talk about the price, but not nearly as much as they do today and with a very different motivation. You can clearly sense that today it's all about pumping value to cash out, while in the old days it was more like "price went up, this will help the adoption and I'll be able to spend my coins at more places". Not that many people were looking for peaks to go back to usd.

Look, I don't give a damn what a bunch of corporate folks agreed to between themselves. They might run whatever software they want to, but they have absolutely no authority to dictate what software I should use. I never agreed to any change in consensus rules, never will and my money, nodes and businesses will reflect that.
These rules apply to everyone. If you want to run B2X software, go for it, but don't expect my nodes to accept your blocks. I'll leave you alone and will not bother you with my blocks again. Deal?

Welcome aboard!
Next step - try using Bitcoin on a daily basis. Favor merchants that accept it (and preferably don't convert to fiat instantly). If someone is willing to pay you in BTC - take it.
It's fun when your BTC increases in value, but it's way more fun if you don't have to touch fiat at all :-)

I think it's very viable for business transactions. First, you don't need to have every tx confirmed in 10 minutes. I know some people like to live from payday to payday, but come on, most of the time you can wait a few hours. On rare occasions when you need to get confirmation fast, paying $2-3 isn't exactly terrible.
I order food daily and pay exclusively with Bitcoin, never had any issues and never had to pay more than $0.20 for a transaction.
Next year, once LN wallets are actually usable, we'll also get instant, super cheap transactions for "coffee" transactions. This will also relieve on-chain capacity.
Bitcoin is doing great, but things, especially $100bn financial networks just take time to fully develop.

They cannot control it, but they can try to track it. When you use a KYC/AML exchange they can tie your withdrawal addresses to your identity. They can then try to track how the money moves (with a varying degree of success). They can also try to retain some metadata from the network, like IP origin of transactions to improve the analysis.
If you exchange your coins for cash only and hide your IP, you're making it extremely difficult to track, though.

Owning Bitcoin is not a problem, you don't owe any tax as long as you hodl. The issue here was that a couple of weeks ago an interpretation from IRS surfaced saying that ALL bitcoin transactions (including on exchanges), regardless of your cost base will have a 1% tax on them (this is specific to polish law I guess). So if you're a day trader, doing tens or hundreds of txs per day, even if you don't turn any profit you still end up owing a huge amount in tax.
Fortunately it seems they're backing out of this interpretation.

It was a comparison not an analogy.
Also, if you do the math...
Let's assume 2000 kcal daily calorie expenditure. It's tough to give 2000 kcal a price, but let's use bananas for scale. [Bananas also have close to 1kcal/1g]( so it's easy math. [1kg of bananas is roughly $1.50 in the US]( So 2000 kcal costs $3. Assuming someone spends 2 minutes reading the comments here, they'd use (2/(60*24)) = 0.139% of their daily calories, which is roughly $0.004  worth of bananas. 1 SAT is $0.000067, but OP got 1/1000th of it, so they got $0.000000067, which is ~60000 times less than the cost of bananas needed to cover the calorie loss.
So not only was this NOT an analogy, it was a very correct remark.

Yes, paywalls as we know them are a terrible UX, but they don't have to be.
With LN the paywall could look like a little number of satoshis you'll pay just under the play button with no extra steps required. Maybe since it's a payment just one additional click to confirm the payment? Anyways, with LN there are no limits to how well the UX could be designed.

You're forgetting that difficulty adjusts down the same way. If we lose a significant share of hash rate, we'll see scarcer blocks and network capacity will go down. This leads to mempool growing and increased transaction fees, which, in turn drive mining profitability up until difficulty readjusts. There are many more factors to profitability than just hash rate.

How is it 519996? Halving takes place every 210k blocks and we started with 50 btc reward, so:

Others have already pointed out why HW wallets are far superior to Coinbase and other custodial services.
Losing a hw wallet is not really a big deal, as the backup seed follows [BIP0039]( and you can use the seed on any compatible wallet to recover your keys.
I personally know several people who lost money due to sudden reputable (at the time) exchange shutdown and I've read hundreds of horror stories over the last 5 years. I have yet to meet a person who lost money from a hardware wallet. As long as you do a proper seed backup you're very safe.
Lastly, Bitcoin was created to avoid censorship and eliminate reliance on 3rd parties. Using centralized custodial services contradicts Bitcoin's sole reason to exist.

Not saying there isn't some risk in using LN today, but it's relatively small.
Keep in mind VEF has an inflation rate of 450%, so it's become useless as a currency. Bitcoins aren't stable either, but with VEF your money is *guaranteed* to lose almost all of its value in a year. Foreign currencies are not available in digital form. Physical assets are very dangerous to posses, people get killed and robbed of them on a daily basis.
I'd say it's a smart move to use LN if it's within your capabilities, because:
* Not many people use LN yet anyways, so near-term LN revenue is gonna be a small percentage of your overall revenue, so the overall risk is really small.
* On-chain txs are cheap today, but they will go up sooner or later, so it's smart to be ready for when that happens.
* By using LN you actually help speed up the maturing process. As with any other cutting-edge technology, without early users we cannot get enough feedback to perfect the technology.

Yes, you're right, Bitcoins are locked in an open channel. There are 2 things worth noting:
1. LN is great for daily transactions that require instant "confirmation", not so much for large purchases. If you wanna buy a house or a car you're better off doing a regular layer 1 transaction. There's so much buzz around LN, but let's keep in mind that good ol' on-chain transactions are not going away.
2. If LN picks up, supply of Bitcoin will shrink (due to lots of btc being locked in open channels between "hubs") and this will put an upwards pressure on the price. Good news for hodlers ;)

@_date: 2017-07-05 13:37:53
Because this should be accessible to anyone. Bitcoin must be inclusive to succeed. To quote &gt; we'd have at least(!) 30 GB blocks each 10min or 1600 TByte per year. At least!
At 1.6 PB per year it's only possible for corporate players/rich people. Exactly something we want to avoid. As we know Moore's law [is]( [not]( [gonna]( [help]( us. Even if technology could somehow keep up, why, even in 10 years would there be a demand for 2PB consumer drives? 2PB is roughly 180000 hours of ultra HD (4K) video. How do you justify that for mass market? Even if we go VR, Super Ultra HD and increase storage demand tenfold, who needs to store 18000 hours of content? And that's at 2PB/year which is still nothing if we wanted to have all transactions on-chain.

You must be thinking about something else because Bisq is designed in a way that there's no central authority that could possibly reject anything. It's completely peer-to-peer and the only entity you need to agree with is the counterparty to the transaction.

It's not exactly the same thing. Postal service used to deliver both messages (information) and parcels (physical objects). Nobody uses postal services for transferring information anymore (except dinosa... uh, governments), but because of the growth of ecommerce, parcel delivery services are doing just fine.
Financial industry is pretty much all information-based. It's also organized extremely inefficiently. There's no standard for digital invoices, no common API for financial services, etc, which leads to huge amount of manual paper work. Bitcoin can potentially change that.
While there will still be many areas where financial specialists will still be necessary (you're not gonna automate the job of a CFO anytime soon), a huge part of low-level jobs could be wiped out.

I don't think mining will ever be free, since the total cost of mining operations is more than just the cost of pure energy. And cheap is not a problem since cheap is a very relative term. A coin can be considered insecure when an attack is possible and the potential benefits of the attack outweigh the cost of the attack corrected by the risk of failure. The absolute cost is not that important.
Even with free energy the mining ops will compete on other operational costs and an attacker would still need to match those costs (roughly speaking since there's an unlikely, but possible case where the attacker is significantly more efficient than the market).
There's another interesting perspective - even in a world where energy is completely green and free and you only need to pay for its delivery, Bitcoin will be perfectly secure as long as it uses &gt;50% of total global energy supply. Even much lower share would make it secure for all practical considerations, since it's extremely unlikely any attacker would be able to capture, say, 20% of global energy supply.

But, again, this is a limitation with banks, not Bitcoin. I could spend and earn Bitcoin without even having a bank account (my friend does that actually). Bitcoin does not depend on banks, exchanges do.

Yeah, it's not necessarily stupid, it's risky. Some people ignore the risk with no upside, some understand it and can benefit from it. Stupidity is just the former.

In general - yes, small transactions could work with zero conf. In practice it would make fraud possible, which then in turn would definitely happen. Even if fraud was very small, any fraud forces payment processors to have fraud-related policies and processes, which in turn increases per-transaction costs.
Also, if we're looking at scaling, we're talking about thousands of transactions per second in a matter of a couple of years. You don't want to have that on the blockchain. Businesses like Burger King really need to wait for L2 solutions.

Panels are not free, but the energy they collect is.

They're not directly related, but... a lot of fraud and red flags are a result of reversible nature of credit cards, paypal, etc. Also, it's easy to imagine an open payment channel where I get billed instantly for every 1kW, pretty much eliminating risk on both ends. We're still very far from that happening, but it's definitely a possible scenario.

Now only if ETH could get an immutable blockchain... :P

If we're aiming to build a global payment system we need to be ready for tens of thousands of transactions per second. Currently average transaction is somewhere around 400 bytes. Even if we cut that in half to 200 bytes, 10k transactions is still 2MB. That gives 1.2 GB blocks every 10 minutes with 10k tps, which isn't even close to what can actually happen if we succeed.
So on-chain scaling for payment purposes is unrealistic. Not to mention speed as said. SegWit in its pure form will give a roughly 2x increase in block size, which should be enough for the near future and should give us enough time to offload a large chunk of transactions to L2. Once we're there we can then start to evaluate if blocksize increase is actually needed and on what terms, AND for what purpose exactly. Like I said "coffee" payments is a really bad trigger for scaling since it leads nowhere.
Just as scarcity and limited supply works great for Bitcoin as a currency, limited supply of block data forces the market to self-regulate tx fees and prevents blockchain from bloat. Imagine what would happen if we went BU way and 2 years down the line we get to 200 tps. Layer 2 would not get developed, because there's no need (since L1 scales so well!), average block size would get to about 50 MB, which would make running a full node much more difficult/costly, mining would get much more difficult for smaller players centralizing it even more than it is now, etc.
I'm not entirely against SegWit2x though, I just think that the 2x increase from just the pure SegWit should be enough for a while and HF is always a big downside.
In short - I'd scale on-chain only when we have a really good reason to, and "coffee" payments aren't one.

Then place your bets and let's talk again in 10-20 years. Cheers.
