No, that's really the hacker in the video.

BTC deposits always took ages because Big Vermin was trading with your coins.

I like how the captions fit with the style and era of the video. Pro. Haha. I also like the *"jack me and i'll jack ya back"* mentality... Hi paypal haha^haha

No I don't but if your information regarding the address changes is accurate then this is a plausible theory.

Blockchain has a mobile app called zeroblock with a collated news feed including current stories from the main sources (coindesk, reddit etc) Its main purpose is a price ticker, it also has a calculator/converter.

On the teamspeak Potter seemed woefully disconnected from the reality of the damage this will do to bitfinex's reputation. He seemed to think finex would just go back to normal and make enough money to pay everyone back. :/ ?

It's super easy to find out who you are twisted. Be careful. Is it you who moved the coins or have you already been pwned for them?

It was apparently edited after the winner was announced and Twisted got all their accounts hacked. I thought that the original address (1NYT) was there in the first place and the reddit account hacker put in 16LQ after the fact. I dunno why they would do that though.
Unless... the hacker pwned Twisted's reddit, changed the BTC address to his own and sent himself the coins.

I like this theory. Could of course be totally wrong but it's clever.

The whole debate can be viewed as a stress test on bitcoin core. Injecting views into the debate and observing the node/miner response. The larger block size code has already been written which means it can be merged into bitcoin core when necessity dictates, a lot of the hyperbole surrounding it is just that. All in all it's good for bitcoin. It has passed one of the most fundamental stress tests in a decentralized system, the unpredictability and ease of persuasion of popular opinion.

If it was a bank who was getting their apps cloned they wouldn't get anywhere near the app store. Typical apple biased cronieism.
