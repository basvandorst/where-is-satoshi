You're right.  I am a avid Hodler of ETH and LTC.  It's just the bots caused me to revisit the hodl strategy.  I'm seeing up and down all the time that seems systemic.  I will keep holding but I may need to employ this other method as well to keep me from being the only hodler I know.

1. I never stated bots were new
2. bots are increasing in number (proliferation)
3. It's important to separate the aspect of buy for profit because this issue of one of losing money invested. not in gaining profit.  If the bots gain profits from my or any other persons investment is the issue.  Because even if I were not looking to gain profits, that doesn't mean i want to lose my investment either.  
You made a good point about the market losing volatility over time but the only market people seem to compare crypto to is the stock market.  So there is no true patter for the theory of losing volatility over time although I would ad it would be great if this is the case.  
It wouldn't say that any one group or one people holds the true value of BTC, it's more of a combination of entities that determines that, and bots are one that see you be able to bring the value down as been sited by many notable and credible parties.  
Bot manipulation has been a hot topic but the truth is no one is claiming to know the exact one thing that is plaguing the market or claim that there is 'one' thing.  Again there are multiple things.  I believe we need and info graphic on this.

yes, but the stock market is not as volatile as cryptocurrencies.  A volatile market is a bot's playground.

that was the next step, after coming to these conclusion and then trying to formulate and individual investor response all I can think is to use a bot.  lol
