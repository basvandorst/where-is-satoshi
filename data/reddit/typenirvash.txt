He was off by 65-70% for 2017 depending on how you look at it. 
He also said governments cannot enforce taxation on BTC... And therefore the governments dissolved within a matter of 10 years from 2015, give or take. 
So basically, with our timeline as it is... The world as we know it would be absolutely shattered in 5 years because "governments can't tax BTC". 
However, we're already seeing tax on BTC gains and trades in the US... So there goes that.
He has long been invalidated.

After all, when scarcity hits... Being in the top 10, 20, 30% of anything will treat you quite nicely.

Anyone have an opinion on the Ledger?
@_date: 2019-08-09 12:35:20
Really depends, because some cards consider it a cash advance which comes with it's own tricky rules as well. But I have seen a handful of exchanges that accept credit cards through Simplex.

I check every day specifically for days like this when we dip to 10.9K so I can dink a little more funds into it.
@_date: 2019-08-08 14:04:51
I mean, honestly, if you did that, and you scooped up a huge return, good stuff brah. You're braver than I am. 
I don't have enough capital to take risks like that. For me, BTC is an investment that will pay off over time. 
I am in zero position to take a risk like that without putting a lot of my financial future in jeopardy. 
Not something I'd recommend even if it worked out for you though... That's a TON of leverage.
@_date: 2019-08-13 13:12:12
I think there is more hype now, just less unrealistic expectations. We're entering the enlightenment slope.

Time travel isn't real, and if somebody really could travel back in time... Why would he not travel back in time to when Satoshi conceptualized BTC instead?
@_date: 2019-08-08 15:39:26
Admittedly, I did the same. I would have liked to have buy a higher stake lower. But I was not in a position to do so financially until around 8K.
@_date: 2019-08-07 12:50:43
BTC has the temperament of a rebellious 16 year old. It does what it wants to do. While it does agree to some market principles, we always have to acknowledge that speculation is just that... Speculation.
@_date: 2019-08-13 16:03:24
I think that you're going to be very upset in the next couple of years.
You should substantiate your claims, tbh
@_date: 2019-08-09 12:44:10
The sooner it comes, the less we can accumulate! I don't mind if it hangs on... Just a bit longer ;)
@_date: 2019-08-14 17:40:52
When it gets to that point, I'd like to think I'll no longer have to be concerned with what the USD conversion is
@_date: 2019-08-09 13:02:27
Yeah, I want more people to on board. :) 
But I feel like ATH climbs scare newbies because what tends to happen is a correction almost immediately after and then all of a sudden everyone's a bear :(
@_date: 2019-08-07 16:15:17
I agree that it is better to be safe than sorry in most cases. The thing is, they can't be exactly certain that any transactions coming from anywhere are you, unless you reveal that they are you. So if we're functioning under the impression that he had sent BTC from a wallet not linked to an exchange, the only way the IRS would know is if his wallet had already been revealed as his. 
But yeah, I'm certain that if you're buying on an exchange and transferring that cryptocurrency into a single wallet, if said exchange provides information to the IRS, you're likely compromising the identity of said wallet to the IRS. 
But that's just sort of my basic understanding of this.
@_date: 2019-08-07 13:38:11
The question is, though; if you're not sending funds to an exchange or from an exchange, how could the IRS confirm that the transfer of BTC from wallet to wallet was not a single user transferring his coins to his own wallets?
@_date: 2019-08-16 00:23:30
:( McAfee dun make mistake
@_date: 2019-08-08 14:55:58
Rolling my eyes at you while I sit at my desk plunking barely any additional time into any of this. 
You sound like you just want to be upset at something.
Between us, I have two jobs already. I would never get an additional job SPECIFICALLY to speculate on a market.
With that in mind it's strange to counter that you should get a second job, decrease your free time, risk additional capital and increase your stress specifically to speculate on a market that is this volatile.
EDIT: that being said, if you can't do it at work or find ways to do this without expending additional time or obtaining enjoyment from it in your down time, I wouldn't recommend it and I should have specified this on the outset of my first post.
@_date: 2019-08-14 12:52:22
Friendly reminder .01/$100 is nice, clean, and a great price.
@_date: 2019-08-09 14:45:16
And because the payment systems in place are already pretty solid, there is definitely that obstacle. Many people who do not currently see a value in the currency may not see the value until BTC reaches a similar point. But I believe offering a discount could possibly create a clause of usefulness :)
I'd definitely like to see what can be done to make the "on-boarding" process much easier, and less complicated. We still have people who are in the space asking where they can purchase X/Y/Z with X/Y/Z method of purchase. 
And we can't forget about how certain exchanges that allow certain payment methods don't serve certain locations :( 
But yeah, I am very hopeful that the future of BTC is ease of access! :) I believe we will solve this in the coming years as the mainstream audience finds more use.
@_date: 2019-08-08 12:31:59
You know, it's funny. Yesterday I saw a lot of people upset about $-500 drops. But we shouldn't be looking at hourly charts unless you're day trading BTC, or searching for new positions to get into at lows. 
If you're DCA'ing, you should be looking at the bigger picture. BTC is going to grow, and we know that. We can't focus on 12K resistance so hard and be so concerned with when we rise above it. It will rise above it. 
BTC has been kind enough to give you the opportunity to get in at 10-12K for a long time. Just like it gave the opportunity to get in at 3K. I'm not sure how long we will see these numbers for or if we may ever see them again. (We might though).  
And even if we re-test 8-9K we're getting a deal on something that will inevitably become prominent in the future. 8-12K might seem steep for most people, but I think it's generally still the ground floor, and it's a great position to get into.
@_date: 2019-08-07 14:47:45
I see BTC as the ultimate playing field leveling opportunity for human beings right now. With current price forecasts, there is a big possibility that even at 10K-12K BTC you're still going to see large return on a small investment in the coming decades. 
This is one of those things people will kick themselves for not trying to understand in the next 10 years.
@_date: 2019-08-13 22:58:17
@_date: 2019-08-09 13:27:30
This is where I have been with it lately. 
My stance is that it will eventually become widely used, and when it does I'd like to have some. 
And it's a nice addition to my retirement portfolio. 
People have wildly outlandish expectations as a result of the 2017 market.
@_date: 2019-08-09 12:46:34
Coinbase reports to the IRS, sorry, I just generalized here. Used Fed as a catch-all, but considering both are three letters, I shouldn't have. Let me edit.
@_date: 2019-08-19 17:37:34
I put all my BTC into cold storage as soon as I have the ability to.
@_date: 2019-08-08 14:19:01
Don't look for the moon. 
DON'T LOOK FOR THE MOON. 
The moon ALREADY happened. BTC went from nothing to 10K. Right now, we're looking for an appreciating asset in addition to your savings plan. 
BTC will, in my opinion, appreciate over time. I do not know how high, and I will not make any price predictions. But BTC is not going to become astronomical or "life changing" in the next year or two... Depending on how much of it you own. 
If you're looking down the road you should be looking in 10 years.
@_date: 2019-08-08 16:12:17
You can't withdraw or send it to somebody immediately. You can, however, sell it for USD. But you also can't withdraw that immediately either.
@_date: 2019-08-09 12:29:15
Can we talk about something for a moment; 
When BTC was first presented, it was created as a decentralized currency and payment system. I really always loved this idea, and generally want to see that vision come to life. I admit, my first experience with BTC was in 2016, when I'd purchased BTC to exchange for a good. I ended up not buying said item because the whole thing confused me, and I forgot about ever having made the purchase. I admittedly missed out on the run in 2017, much to my chagrin. But that is neither here nor there. I point this out to admit that I haven't been "on-board" since the beginning, but have always sort of agreed quietly with the supposed end result.
But there are some things in the crypto space that concern me, the first of which being Coinbase reporting to the IRS, and Libra coming in hot (I'm 99% certain that it's on the way). None of these represent what crypto currency was supposed to be at inception, but Coinbase (along with many others) is in support of Libra. This is troubling in many ways, because Coinbase is the on ramp for a lot of people. Coinbase also does many other things that are against the original vision of crypto as well.
That and, many of the people who buy BTC do it to speculate. I don't know what the over/under is on the amount of people who buy BTC to actually spend it and people who are HODLing it. But I think that the continued success of BTC relies on both enthusiasts and the general public using BTC as a payment system in addition to a store of value. 
I work a second job as a personal trainer, and because I make the rules, I was considering charging BTC for services instead of USD. At least to my younger clients. I feel like that could start some conversations about the space, and also open up a new use clause for some people who haven't tried it before. I would probably need to incentivize this so I am thinking offering a discount for paying in BTC.
@_date: 2019-08-13 13:03:42
Very pleased to see BTC still lingering at .008X/$100, but really miss BTC at .01/$100. 
Just a little perspective.

Nobody searches up just "Bitcoin". 
Coinbase saw a spike in activity/searches in 2019.
Coinmama holding steady in terms of searches in 2019. 
"Buy Bitcoin" saw a spike in 2019
The search query "BTC" also saw a spike in 2019. 
What you're seeing is that more people have learned about Bitcoin and nobody is just searching "Bitcoin" anymore. 
So yeah, you're fear mongering, cherry-picking, and making some pretty silly claims. Actually, you've proven that BTC is becoming more and more mainstream. The queries that trend higher are showing that more people have slightly more general knowledge of Bitcoin.
Are you also alleging that Goldman Sachs is not advising clients to purchase BTC?
@_date: 2019-08-09 12:59:52
I agree, decentralized "on-ramps" are going to be required for BTC to become the global norm. 
If, in the next few years, something like that emerges, I would be to the moon with joy :)
@_date: 2019-08-13 23:00:10
Just an aside: Blanket statements are almost always erroneously false. 
With that in mind, it's near impossible to make a statement like that and be considered intellectually serious.
@_date: 2019-08-08 13:09:36
Yikes, no I wouldn't recommend taking a loan for a year's worth of salary. 
There is always the possibility that BTC finds a level well under what is commonly forecasted. I mean, it WILL eventually reach a point where it is no longer volatile. When that happens, there is a possibility it does not hit the numbers we project. And you'll have to pay down your loan before that happens. 
... There is a possibility you could get absolutely REKT doing something like this and it's WAY less safe.
I'm a bull, but I don't recommend going 40+K into debt for BTC
@_date: 2019-08-09 14:41:07
Thanks, I think I will experiment with finding a way to make this a reality without giving anybody a headache. I know my first experience with it was confusing and ultimately left me not sure of how to proceed. 
So it's sort of a matter of figuring out how to get BTC into a client's hands in the easiest, hassle free way possible.
@_date: 2019-08-14 18:51:43
:) .01/$100 Gather round friends. It is time. I've been waiting on this one.
@_date: 2019-08-09 14:47:48
Great points! :) 
The replies I've received are exactly the type of conversation I was hoping to have about the future of BTC. 
I agree that the store of value case is especially strong in this economy. And if it brings in new users, I can hope that it will also create more impetus to transact down the line. 
I really do believe that we are on the verge of a bright future for BTC
@_date: 2019-08-10 17:40:14
One thing that's always stuck with me is this: you should always see the money you're investing into BTC as something that could potentially decrease.
You shouldn't focus on the daily charts if your goal is long term investment, because historically BTC has performed well. But we can't always assume that past performance is indicative of future gains because it is always possible that BTC could level out well below what most people anticipate.
I think that a lot of people see it as a sort of lottery ticket or a form of escape, but BTC isn't that anymore. If you didn't get in during the early days, you probably won't become "rich". But at least you have the opportunity to increase your initial investment over the next decade.
Don't get me wrong, I would love for it to go through the roof because it'd mean I'd make a lot of money. But if you get really bent out of shape about losing the money you invested in it, it's because your expectations are way too high. And I don't blame people for expecting the market to be like 2017 again.
I want us all to succeed.

Also, if you're a DCA'er and you REALLY want to put more money into BTC but can't afford it... 
There are plenty of ways to make additional Sats online at, mostly, zero cost to you. There are plenty of faucets that run hourly, and most of them give 6-8 Sats/visit. There are also sites that offer Sats as a reward for tasks, or surveys and some of those offer pretty decent Sat rewards (5-12k). 
It's not a lot RIGHT NOW. In fact, if they were paying you in USD, I'd tell you not to even bother. But 10K Satoshi right now is about 1 USD. That's 1 USD that you didn't have to spend. 
Yes, it's not a lot, right now. But eventually, it will become more. So there's still good opportunities to get into an appreciating asset at little to no additional cost to your DCA'ing. Betting on the fact that the price will rise, and that these opportunities will begin to dry up when that is the case (or at least shrink in size greatly)
Most people don't see it as worth it, but with a good stack of faucets you visit hourly--plus a handful of offer walls on a regular basis... I've clocked as much as $30 additional worth of Satoshi in the last two weeks.
@_date: 2019-08-07 14:37:38
I don't know about you but I'm perfectly happy with the whole "faceless anonymous rich immaterial" depiction of Satoshi given that it represents what Bitcoin is and is supposed to do so very well.
@_date: 2019-08-09 14:38:17
I really appreciate the kind words! 
You elaborate on some very interesting ideas, that definitely serve as food for thought here. Generally speaking, I agree that bringing more attention to BTC through projects like Libra is always good for BTC. Especially when the project is centralized. 
However, I just don't see a purpose for a centralized digital currency that fills the position Libra is trying to fill beyond adding additional speed/ease of global payment without having to first exchange currency. I also think that there are some alts that sort of fill this role, but throwing Facebook's weight behind a new alt could possibly be the reason why it would "succeed" at filling this purpose. 
I am confused, though, by how we can legitimize BTC without centralizing it. I definitely understand taxing income, but I do not know how taxing capital gains, and income received through the currency can be done in a way that does not possibly jeopardize the nature of BTC. Short of revealing data about your wallet address, how can we report without "giving it all away"? I'm still mostly new to the space, and really want to learn more about it, as well as hear people's opinions/thoughts. 
I wholeheartedly agree that the long term view of BTC is where we should set out eyes. I believe, however the incarnation appears, it is still the future. And I really want to see where that future takes us. 
Thanks for being down to chat about this, I think the thoughts you posited were very important!
@_date: 2019-08-12 17:23:01
Because BTC is the currency of the people, would it not technically be considered organic when a person influences it?
@_date: 2019-08-11 19:01:15
I feel like if you're trading BTC (or just trading in general) you should always try to refrain from feeding into an extreme mental state.
@_date: 2019-08-09 13:03:12
BTC is having a nice vacation rn :)
@_date: 2019-08-13 12:52:46
How can you allege that there are no new investors when Goldman Sachs is advising their clients to invest in Bitcoin, Bitcoin futures are out, and we see people adjusting their views on Bitcoin regularly? 
The fact that the majority of people are, indeed, changing their tone about BTC is enough to let you know there are plenty of new investors.
@_date: 2019-08-07 12:23:11
Honestly, I am okay with it lingering here. I think there is great value in a 10-12K BTC considering future price forecasts.
@_date: 2019-09-18 00:09:06
If I get bamboozled, that's my own fault :)

BTC having a great time @ 10K. 
Have said it before and will say it again: .01BTC/$100 is aesthetic

It's not much, but it's honest work.

BTC has a great use-case for money. 
But the problem that it's current store of value is too great for it's own good right now
I mean, would you rather spend $100 or .01 BTC knowing that BTC has the potential to continue growing?
