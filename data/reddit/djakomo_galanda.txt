One of Bitfinex big questions: Will its token reach 1 USD?
After the August 2 hack, Bitfinex resumed its trading and withdrawals yesterday, so now most of the talk regarding this exchange market is about their previously issued Bitfinex tokens (BFX). These tokens are debt-based blockchain convertible to USD equity at Bitfinex exchange.
So, after every Bitfinex depositor took a 36% loss, he was credited with an equivalent number of BFX tokens representing the dollar value of the loss. Thus, $1 loss grants 1 BFX in return. Long term idea is that Bitfinex attempts to buy back those tokens as close to face value as possible. 
Will 1 BFX reach 1 USD? Predict at Fairlay:
And after BFX opened at at $0.10 it rose to as much as $0.40. Currently it is traded around $0.30 and there is already a lot of talk is it the right time to sell as no one knows what will happen with BFX. Some are still scared that Bifinex could face bankruptcy, while others think it is smarter to wait.
Those deciding to wait think that Bitfinex will buy a lot of tokens through time and then redeem those left on the market. But what about the price? Will it go up to $1 in the future, or could even Bitfinex redeem remaining tokens after recovery (or regaining back lost funds) at price of $1? 
Well, predict at Fairlay.
