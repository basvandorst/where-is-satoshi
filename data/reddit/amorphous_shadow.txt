I would say they are innocent, except I signed up yesterday and then today I get hacked. Or it's a coincidence, it's hard to know for sure.
The email and password are both different between Mt Gox and BtcPrizes.

Same position as me. I tried getting money into my dwolla account when btc was at $9 per, and then it took 6 days to get the money into dwolla and then into mt gox. Next thing I know the price has already more than doubled. &amp;

Very cool and very generous of them. Easy to sign up too.
@_date: 2011-06-15 16:01:09
Ah, then I misunderstood. I was under the impression that higher difficulty would result in less BTC being mined per person, resulting in a lower supply. My mistake.
@_date: 2011-06-08 20:49:53
And back down it goes.

I would agree if I was the only person having problems. I believe once plenty of people start having problems, maybe it means there needs to be a little more security.
@_date: 2011-06-17 20:52:15
I for one, think that is a great idea.
@_date: 2011-06-10 02:06:57
That's a good point. However, there are still plenty of people that would like to invest in google or apple I'm sure, but can't due to the price.

And not like it matters anymore, but the funds moved to this address: 	1DpBBPGBy8N3yDiPRW11EhkEiTMQs2aCp3. Jesus I'm so pissed right now.

Except most people aren't going to feel like buying in when the price is anywhere close to $100 per coin. IMO.
@_date: 2011-06-17 19:55:12
Damnit. I even made sure to use an email and password that were unique for that lotto. Sigh. Just my luck.
@_date: 2011-06-09 21:19:06
I can not lie, if it manages to hit $1000/BTC every early adopter would jump for joy. I'm not that optimistic quite yet however.
@_date: 2011-06-14 15:04:46
I'm not sure, but I get the same message. Probably just stopping people from logging in for some reason.
@_date: 2011-06-16 21:15:05
I got in right before it went down. It was only giving out .04 BTC. So you didn't really miss much.

combination of alpha and numeric characters.
@_date: 2011-06-17 19:38:58
Yeah. I'm a bit upset because I was about to move them back to a personal wallet and encrypt it while I wait for the price to stabilize. Bah.
@_date: 2011-06-15 14:26:01
Supply and demand. Less supply will create more demand.
@_date: 2011-06-17 22:17:19
It was 12 characters long and yes I did.
