I have a offline (wireless adapter went out a year ago) lap top that I will be storing everything, so I can take my external hard drive, transfer from my desktop to my laptop. That will technically be cold storage correct? Now I understand that I should also have paper wallets in case the harddrive takes a shitty.

Got it, I'm a dumbass. I don't know how I read around every article that stated that.

Now based off of all of the information I have researched on cold storage, coinbase does not give you complete control over your wallet. I am set up for 3 forms of cold storage so how would I go about doing that? (sorry for the infancy, I can sell the hell out anything, just want to be prepared for every question.)

As of right now my account is setup for demoing, which is why I only went in on .5. My colleague is currently holding 24 BTC and is much more comfortable with the system.

I see where you are coming from, but I also am in because I want to see a cypto become mainstream. Investing in Bitcoin and then spending, advertising, and promoting it, will result in benefits. International fees will not be a factor for one. Right now I see it as investing, because I want to see Bitcoin grow and become mainstream.

Willing to listen, please explain?

Got it, which is why I do not have access to my private keys. Coinbase is acting as a bank in that regard (handling security), does that sound correct? Based off this article

So how does have everyone have their wallets split up. Based off everything I have taken in today, I will be two paper wallets per .5 BTC. Is that excessive, or more personal preferance? I will be treating this as savings for now.
