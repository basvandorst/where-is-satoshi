Real exchanges within a week or so.  Right now it's just on etherdelta..
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:35:30
It would probably be easier at this point to sign up over at Kucoin exchange and buy there.  I recently decided to never use etherdelta again due to losing too much eth in failed transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:03:51
I guess but it could have something to do with that.  Seems kinda dumb to sell off that news.  People have been complaining about miner centralization in China for years lol.

I choose not to use usdt because I'm not going to be bagholding if they get shut down.  Id rather hold real crypto that would go back up in value eventually.  Perhaps lots of dumb people will crash the market endless times in the future doing dumb things like using usdt, I will not be one of them.

I'm not the best with explaining the technical side but one important point to keep in mind is that this re programming won't just be forced on everyone.  Plenty of people have forked bitcoins code to make changes to the system that ended up going nowhere and people just kept using the original version.
For example looking at bitcoin cash, this was created as a fork of bitcoin that a lot of people did want due to the debate over block size and scaling.  
Applying this to the far future when bitcoins "run out" there may be different camps with different ideas about what should be done, different versions of bitcoin trying out different solutions to the problems.

What about paypal they used to have a way to transfer the balance of a gift card to your account.

You could open a new account with a cellphone provider that lets you use an unlocked phone and no contract with that phone number.  Once you get your Coinbase funds back you could just cancel the phone plan.

I'm not sure what purity trolling is..  I understand what you are looking for more now though, you are trying to get a read on the overall perception of bitcoin.  Definitely a smart thing to try and do right now!

Yeah price went up immediately after launch so I'm not real worried at the moment.  I saw someone saying a lot of the fud going around was being fueled by bch maximalists, not sure if thats true but could be a factor.

The crazy run up to basically 20k did make a lot of people nervous.  I can understand being less nervous watching this correction compared to that epic run.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:39:14
probably not the answer you want to hear but you could sell it to someone for cash, maybe give them a small profit since nobody likes to spend the change on those things, deposit that then wire to coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:04:17
The bitcoin being bought from Coinbase isn't necessarily owned by them, the price goes by what the current market price is on GDAX their back end exchange.  There is no centralized system that determines price.  It is possible to determine the current average price by averaging the price on all the exchanges and weighting by volume.
Are you just looking for place to check price?  In that case coinmarketcap.com usually does a pretty decent job.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:52:50
Is it a separate option to send within coinbase user to user?  Anyone know?

I guess just try to find solace in the fact that most people willing to risk buying on credit will probably just loose all their gains at some point in the future.  I don't like the idea of owing money to anyone so I haven't tried to buy on credit.

Okay that make sense I had a feeling I was giving off a little attitude on that first comment but I didn't stop to edit for some reason.  I'm interested in the same issues.  One thing I have noticed more recently in the past few days is a lot of newcomers trying to rush in and buy some bitcoin litecoin or ethereum *as quickly as possible* without putting in time to figure out the best/cheapest/safest way to do so which is a little scary to see.  I think a lot of first time buyers are just fomoing in before they really comprehend the whole thing.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:42:14

Consider creating a diverse crypto portfolio if you aren't looking to do a lot of trading or constantly keep an eye on everything this is the way to go.
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:09:36
You could go with ETH which would be convenient because lots of exchanges have ETH trading pairs.  LTC usually has the lowest fees of the big 3.
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:36:48
I liked the article until the part where some totally unrelated video began blasting.

@_date: 2017-12-10 02:43:43
Bitcoin was used as a way to buy things anonymously for awhile but was never designed for this purpose and kind of sucks at it.  If privacy currency is what you are looking for there are some pretty good crypto projects that specialize in that.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:29:33
Yeah you can also use it as a store of value.  The price will bounce around until people stop speculating about it so much, who knows how long that will take.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:02:34
It could go that way yeah, or perhaps once lightning network is done it will be the opposite of how you describe.  With lightning network transactions will be near instant and very cheap.
I expect regulations when it comes to the exchanges for example possibly the gov could mandate built in tax payment systems or something like that but exchanges have no power over your bitcoin once you transfer it out.

@_date: 2017-12-10 03:13:22
Look into lightning network, there are plans like this to solve the fee and delay problems with transactions.  Otherwise if its not for you thats fine.
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:32:34
The key points are bitcoin is managed by a decentralized group of developers.  The system is a distributed ledger and is highly secure when used properly.
I think a lot of people are probably not ready to trust technology, or at least don't trust themselves to use it properly.  And rightly so, with all the scams out there.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:24:04
What it actually is and what governments say it is are different matters.  Currently it seems bitcoin is more of a savings account store of value function but I would like to see fees go down as the tech scales in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:46:07
Depends on what you are trying to do, amount is how much you want to spend and price is the price per Bitcoin you are wanting to pay.  If you out $7500 in the price box the market would need to crash pretty hard before your order would be filled.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:50:27
Awesome question.  Bitcoins price will vary market to market depending on what people are currently paying for it there.

@_date: 2017-12-10 01:03:43
To be fair this is a community of people here to talk about bitcoin.  In general people don't seek out communities devoted to subjects they dislike.
As far as your question I feel there is still a long way to go before the general non owning portion of the public looks at bitcoin favorably.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:26:21
This is what a lot of people are saying.  I think its quite possible something similar will play out but I just don't see a flash crash going that low.  I'll start buying if it drops below 10k myself.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:29:40
She probably watches the news and this stuff has been all over the news lately.  Smart granny thats an easy stash of bitcoins she wont have to worry about the tech side!
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:52:28
To change this it would require a hard fork of the code, which the users would never agree to therefore the original chain with the 21 million Bitcoins would win out.  Devils advocate will say hardforks are a form of inflation such as how Bitcoin Cash sort of doubled the total number of bitcoins out there over the summer.  Hardforks are a different beast, users get to keep their original coins and the new hardforked coins, assuming both chains retain relevancy.

I'm curious about this too.  Is it more of a question of when will lightning network be deployed than when will they start accepting it?
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:17:30
The majority of people don't have to start using btc for it to continue to do well.
@_date: 2018-09-25 01:00:20
As long as you're buying from a reputable exchange it shouldn't matter if your coin is freshly mined.  If you really need "fresh" coin the easiest way is to mine it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:01:58
Go all in now or you will regret it after you lost everything because you already went all in and lost it all.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:21:37
Ok, I guess if they give us all our own addresses then they are still stuck with the current network fees until we get lightning.
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:06:57
Well paced, bravo!
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:30:55
Yeah thats fine its a different thing then, still would work for the guy who wants to send $5 to his friend.  Admittedly a lot more complicated than just handing him the fiat money.
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:38:44
Yeah you are right actually that would be a major headache beyond just the taxes.  Imagine the stress if the two guys start buying or selling only their portion of the bitcoin and the percentages start to skew.
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:47:54
You should post your business sometime I bet you could get some more customers.  Nobody likes having to sit through a haircut by someone who they can't relate to at all I can only imagine getting a haircut by a fellow crypto enthusiast!

the problem with using coinbase is you will be paying a premium and coinbase fees.  Transfer money from your bank to Coinbase then send to GDax (the back end exchange run by Coinbase).  Guide here &gt;   not sure if its the best guide but it has the needed info.

In your case I'd say just wait for lower fees.  Yeah nobody wants to get Gox'd but if its just $25 worth there is no point in losing half on fees.
If you really want to get something in a wallet now maybe LTC?

Uh pretty sure anyone brwosing this Reddit knows Warren's opinions on Bitcoin by now?  Lots of things aren't investing but they can still pay off.  Also investing can lead to losses too..
@_date: 2018-05-05 20:05:50
I feel like this has been discussed plenty but hey why not.  I feel that it's ok for Warren to dislike Bitcoin and crypto.  Usually someone points out Warren is quite old and therefore doesn't put the same trust in tech that many of us have.  Warren is all about not losing money so why would he invest in something as volatile as crypto?  I mean even if he believed in the tech he probably wouldn't invest in it due to his investment strategy.
His firm also sold all their shares in IBM and bought a ton more of apple recently probably because IBM is long on blockchain and involved in crypto.

If all Fiat went hyper inflation and somehow our electric power and internet remained functional I think it wouldn't take long for people to get a sense for what one Satoshi is worth.
If all Fiat went hyper inflation after a major catastrophe that knocks out the grid then btc probably wouldn't be the go to currency.
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:06:27
Things are worth what people are willing to pay.  If you're willing to pay attention to the altcoins you buy on a daily basis it could work out pretty good.  Or just buy Bitcoin and check the price now and then.

That is true people forget and don't think much about what they take for granted as  "normal".  Its kinda funny seeing all these death spiral articles and how none of them seem to recognize if it costs too much to mine a bitcoin eventually enough people stop mining and it becomes economical to mine again.  Lightning network will continue to function without miners regardless lol.

It means they are giving you an equal amount of BSV coin to what you held in BCH.  Coinbase will let you withdraw the BSV if you want to hold it in a wallet or sell on a supported exchange.

Further advice; come up with a plan or strategy and stick to it.  Some people are good at predicting price and others are good at buying the dips others just hodl etc.

It lived up to my expectations, except that I thought I'd have a whole bitcoin at least by this point.
@_date: 2019-02-15 19:12:42
Someday, yes however any time in the next few years I very much doubt that high of a price.

tradingview, patience, stop loss
I dont really trade because I suck at all three of those

Hopefully he buys the bottom and sells the top it would be sad if he let the price swings stress him out again.

About 5 bank accounts, 3 ounces, and 2 vehicles.

I wasn't meaning to say you're wrong it was a joke about some fud we have had recently.  I think we had 3 different "china's banning crypto" events in the past half year.  EDIT I'm long on BTC

Store of value doesn't seem to be holding true.  Can our genius devs figure out a way to reduce transaction fees and bring back the currency use case?  Or will I continue to see people insist it's a store of value only as price drops.

Looks like a good article for somewhere like I think most of us here understand these points already

Naah duu

Sorry friend China just banned crypto again.  Oh yeah and another big company is banning crypto adds.  LOL JK 
@_date: 2018-02-26 01:55:30
You could try and steal some although I would say don't do that.  Usually these posts get removed/posters banned
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:39:31
Bitcoin is worldwide so just because you and your friends are down on it doesn't mean it won't get exciting somewhere else in the world.  For example the run up we had this winter was fueled bigly by South Korea.  I think 50k at some point in 2018 is very possible.
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:29:20
Wait a minute that's not a fud article what's going on here?? /s

Real pros work in the hodl too
@_date: 2018-03-21 07:58:11
Yeah I get that side of things.  I just dislike the concept of a blanket ban on crypto related adds seeing how there are plenty of legitimate/useful crypto projects out there.  Also the idea of protecting people from their own stupidity grinds my gears.  
That said there is no denying there has been and will continue to be a lot of scammery in cryptocurrency.

What's halal
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:20:04
I would craft an elaborate scheme whereby you trick a bilingual person into handling it for you.  Then again theres probably a reason I don't hold any valuable domains or much of anything valuable at all so take it with a grain of salt.
@_date: 2018-03-06 01:55:56
There are probably some factors to consider here that might not be obvious.  For example the network fees went up a lot so people are less likely to want to spread their holdings among various addresses. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 09:44:18
Now that you've posted this even less secure.  I don't know though
@_date: 2018-03-14 11:45:40
Google and Facebook are trying to protect their profit models, can't really blame them.  They can disguise it as protecting people due to the large amount of scams and bad projects in crypto but I see these add bans as a last ditch effort to stem the tide.
@_date: 2018-07-05 18:40:10
Fair enough, there are alternative cryptos that don't "waste electricity" if that's how you or op want to look at it.
This topic gets posted so much that I figured anyone subbed here would probably be aware of both sides of the argument by now, I'll try to be less curmudgeonly in the future. 
@_date: 2018-07-10 04:31:23
Also great news we are giving away 1000 ETH!  You are lucky to have seen this!

Ok gotcha yes with bread wallet you control your keys and it is pretty easy to use.

Oh I see so I have a disease ok thanks smart economic people for pointing that out

It seems a lot of sites use these crypto subs to try to generate traffic and ad revenue.  Generally the links are not interesting or helpful whatsoever.
@_date: 2018-04-25 01:51:43
Have you checked out coinbase or the bread wallet?  I think you should look in to �� but if you decide on coinbase I may have a refer link just itching to be used haha

A lot of chart watchers were more concerned with 6400 which was a technical level crossing that had more significance to many than the round 6000.  I believe you meant "Psychological barriers" in that case then you are correct every major round number has an element of being a psychological barrier.  In BTC $10,000 and $20,000 will be the biggest ones to watch for everything after that is would be all time high of course.  It is smart to think about these barriers and not just technical price levels.
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:21:14
Yeah people set sell orders just below the barriers so if the price breaks above them sometimes there is a bit more of a pop up in price, other people see the barrier broken and want to get in.  No guarantees in these types of things but there are definitely patterns like rejections and breakouts around them.
