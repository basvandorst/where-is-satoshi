I kinda think bitcoin is the past of digital currency. It's not really even a currency...
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:39:48
Do you honestly think 20 minutes is fast for a currency transaction? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:54:41


lol. You are talking about two assets with zero intrinsic value and complaining about price movements because you 'like' the one that is going down...
BCH is on coinbase now. A lot of people buy through there. Of course the price is going to go up. Not to mention BTC is basically useless as a currency
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:57:25


This logic is incredibly stupid. What we are seeing today, and have been for the past week, is what happens at the top of every bubble, ever. The people who held the asset through the big gains don't care about a 15% loss. But when you reach the top the big gainers start selling off (as they said they were on this forum) and those sales go to people with weaker hands and less sentimental value. They didn't ride through the gains, so when they lose 20%, they drop it, no problem. 
Think it is bad now, wait until the West Coast wakes up. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:53:05
Yeah it's just a brand, which means it is just hype, which means it is unsustainable. First mover advantage is all it has going. That's wack
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:52:00
You've just listed stopgap measures. The idea that the 'future' includes waiting more than 2 seconds for a transaction to confirm is complete nonsense. Does digital currency have a future? Yeah. Is decentralized blockchain sustainable? No. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:44:36
Then why does this sub literally say, 'the currency of the Internet?'
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:00:32
Oh I'm sorry, can you only get money out of your own ATM's? Can you get instant transfers in your own bank? I'm seriously all for digital currency. It has great cultural benefits. However, it is extremely lacking in convenience compared to the US banking system. 
Not to mention the gigantic and wasteful use of electricity. (which since most mining takes place in developing country, coal burning). And the implicit support of anonymous markets that harm real people. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:37:31
I mean blockchain clearly has major scaling issues and those scaling issues then lead to centralization issues. Blockchain for currency transactions is not the best form-factor in the market. It's old tech now. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:55:23
Yeah no it does not lol. And in the US transfers are literally instantaneous. How is 20 minutes ever going to complete with that? It's a huge red flag that no one seems interested in answering. 
A currency must be a medium of exchange. Bitcoin is barely a currency.

@_date: 2017-02-23 05:16:53


Dude what the fuck are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-02-23 05:19:05
Volatility is a measure of risk. There are many other risks in investing, but volatility is just one. It's the most important one when talking about nominal moves in price. I seriously love how you go from, what do you mean risk?! To, you don't even know what real risk is!
'Investing' in bitcoin is stupid.  


**Even when speculating you weight the risk against the returns you receive for taking that additional risk. Speculation for the purpose of speculation is retarded. **
@_date: 2017-02-21 21:27:08
No. Blockchain technology, distributed ledgers, is going to proliferation through entire industry and become a multi-trillion dollar technology across the globe. Bitcoin, is pretty much the most volatile and stupid way to 'invest' money ever. You might make money, but you're doing it at such a great risk, the returns are never worth it. The structure has deflationary bias, so it should rise over time. But that doesn't justify putting your money into something that swings 20% up and down along the way. If you're putting money into bitcoin you're losing even if you make more than 0. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 05:39:21


Buying extremely volitile 'investments' with risk weighted returns lower than index funds isn't investing, it's throwing away money. Currencies, are not investments. Even established ones. 


Exact opposite. You're the one talking about crazy high volitility for returns that don't make the risk, and rejecting evidence of this by said 'that's not real risk'. 






You haven't explained anything man... you just said that risk isn't real when I posted real measures of risk that show you need to get 5x the market in returns to account for volatility risk alone. Keep 'investing' man!
@_date: 2017-02-22 21:10:21
This person calculated the beta of BTC over a 5 year period to be around 5 in comparison to the S&amp;P 500. That means you roughly need to get 5 times the return on bitcoin to justify the additional risk. If you've put any money in bitcoin the past 5 years you not only got less nominal returns, **but you got murdered when accounting for risk. The S&amp;P 500 returned ~74% over the past 5 year period. You would need to get ~375% return on bitcoin over that same period to justify the investment. So yeah, you're a moron if you 'invest' in bitcoin.** Not to say it isn't worth a gamble, but if you think you're investing you're actually stupid.  
@_date: 2017-02-22 21:04:35


This is the logic that sucks from you people. You make the obviously bias assumption that the price just goes up. You view a currency as an investment, and that 'investment' has a higher beta (volatility) than any reputable financial instrument. Returns are not measured in absolutes, they are measured in weighted risk returns (alpha). Anything that moves 20% in weeks is not, in anyway, giving you a better alpha than just buying an index of the S&amp;P 500. 
If you just said you were gambling with your money that would be fine, but so many of you, really dumb-asses, think because something rises quickly sometimes that means you're winning. Such simple logic from people that think they know something everyone else doesn't.  
@_date: 2017-02-23 05:26:02
So the only risk that is realz is the risk you can't measure? hahahaha holy shit man. You bitcoin people are awesome. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:58:47
Yeah man, you going to actually make a point? 
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:20:34
Umm PPF is like the first thing you learn in economics and it has nothing to do with currency, it has to do with trade. Currencies just solve the barter problem. Money doesn’t allow for the creation of anything... (in the ‘long’ run).
Deflationary spiral can happen without ‘expansive credit collapsing’. In fact, Keynes, and super basic economics, shows the deflationary spiral happens because of purchasing incentives and sticky wages. Credit can actually adjust to inflation just fine with negative interest rates. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:39:49


And this is because they are businesses. You are purchasing a right to a portion of their income. It doesn't work because holding for long is smart, it works because over time they generate cash flow. Bitcoin, gold, dollars, and euros will never, ever, generate cash flow. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:39:16
Yo what happened man? Should have invested everything right?
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:07:35
Np. Strategy over hubris. I'm all for alternative investments, but be objective about your money. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:43:07

Yo wtf happened? BTC down like 25%? Awesome investment bro
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:38:03


No buying stocks and bonds is investing as you're purchasing a stream of income or the promise of a stream of income in the future. You're trading money today for a larger stream of income in the future. That's investing. 
Buying gold or silver or bitcoin or rubles and hoping the price goes up is not investing, its speculation. The problem is you think people buy stocks or bonds because they hope they go up in value. That's not why the stock market exists. 


This completely misses the point by the way...
@_date: 2017-09-23 02:25:26


Dude uber is cheaper like 85% of the time. My company prefers we take uber. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:54:08
It does... It still sounds stupid. Currencies, money, cannot generate income. It is pure speculation. Gold has swung wildly up and down too, while at no point generating cash flow. Speculation is not investing. Going, well it cost $x at time t! Look how great it is! Is not investing.
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:40:22
You're posting click-bait as evidence. I don't get why you associate person pride with investments...

Dude if you have your entire life savinging in anything you're being comically stupid. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:07:18
Dude you think people are losers because they don't buy the things you buy? Man you guys are a cult. Also, if that's the case you haven't bought anything in years sooo why are you going around telling people they're losers for not buying something you don't buy...
@_date: 2017-09-03 16:02:37
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:14:39
Yo stop calling buying a currency an 'investment'. Currencies are not investments.
@_date: 2017-09-23 02:28:14
What this analogy points out is the hypocrisy of the people who treat bitcoin as a cult. Everyone at Big Banks are somehow all-powerful evil geniuses who care only about profit and simultaneously too stupid to pass on what is the 'greatest investment ever'... It's honestly funny. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:10:35
You lost money, that's what's going on. Go buy some stocks or bonds with a dividend. Buying currencies is not investing...
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:57:36
Look man I don't care what you do. I don' take pride in investments. Do you
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:21:41
Buying a currency is not investing... speculation is not investing. If you're just betting something will go up in price you're not investing. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:24:17
Uhhh how the fuck does gold generation cash flow?
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:24:07
Think how stupid someone would sound if they came up to you and said, I turned all my savings into Rubles! Its the next big thing! I'm heavily invested... Currencies are a unit of exchange, not a generator of income. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:24:37
Look man you seem to be missing the point... I'm not sure what to say...
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:29:46
Who has used bitcoin to buy stuff not on the internet? What did you guy? What % of users have?
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:03:02

Investment strategy is not about fear of missing out or looking backwards. You guys seem triggered. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:07:19
What I've written is not a strategy at all. I haven't told anyone what to do with their money, only what not to do. Basic stuff. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:57:19
Yeah no income stream... does BTC pay a dividend I don't know about?
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:23:57
No that's the definition of speculation.

Stop thinking buying a currency is investing and this won't happen to you. Buy stream of income generation not units of exchange. Also maybe take an econ class. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 02:24:05


**Yo this is 100% not true...** 


**Yo wrong again son...** 
11/13 developed countries have seen bond yield rise over the past 52 weeks. Yields rise as prices fall - as in you're wrong.


I mean yield on student loans account for this fact...

So as someone with a degree in finance you know what alpha is and you should be running from bitcoin as you know that investing in paying for risk in all forms...
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:12:55
You can say the same thing about a lot of penny stocks. The general structure isn't new. You shouldn't shy away, but you should be a skeptic. Be wise, not lucky. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:11:31
That's interesting to know. Are you saying margin on your purchase or interest on your held wallet? 
The latter is interesting but brings in risk beyond the value of BTC. Firm risk, systemic risk, liquidity. Your deposits aren't exactly backed up by the FDIC.
I actually think this is the biggest risk with crypto at the moment, not the value, but the logistics. Wallets, secondary market, etc. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:58:25


Dude please with the hubris. Investing isn't about what your returns are as a single person in a single time-frame. It isn't about opinions about anything. If your investment strategy is I pick the best assets, no matter the asset, you're just gambling. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:18:29
Yeah I mean maybe bitcoin was undervalued then or its overvalued now. I don't use opinions to build a strategy for investing though so I don't care so much... I don't know your point.

@_date: 2017-09-01 15:37:36
Unless you're very wealthy or very young, you shouldn't have more than ~5% of your total invested assets in something as volatile as crypto. If the guy is 27 and already has 50k in savings, yeah put a thousand or two in it, whatever. 
But in general a currency should not be thought of as an investment for a lot of reasons I'll get pummeled for on this sub.  That's another discussion.

No one is salty. You took extreme risk and made money. That doesn't make keeping you life saving in a single asset smart, it makes you incredibly stupid.

@_date: 2017-09-01 14:58:02
His stock broker was right... If it was 10k he actually cared about from an investing standpoint he shouldn't be buying an extremely volatile asset with no income stream. It doesn't matter if the volatility as of late has been up. That's still terrible investing.
Edit: btw I love the vitriol that gets thrown at you from hard-liners on this sub if you simply suggest you shouldn't put a huge amount of your money in a volatile asset. They're more intelligent than you, you don't know the technology, invest in shit, etc. If you view your investments as a brand, you're behind the curve, not ahead. I would gladly tell someone to buy some crypto on a pullback, but learn the difference between diversity and stupidity.
