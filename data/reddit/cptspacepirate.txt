Still amazes me (well not really) that so-called financial "journalists" often criticize Bitcoin and other cryptos by bringing up the greater fool theory. 
"you are probably buying a bitcoin because you believe that you will be able to sell it to someone else for more than you paid for it. The Economist calls this The Greater Fool Theory."
Using that mindset/argument, how is owning Bitcoin/crypto any different than owning any stock that does not pay dividends, trading forex, investing in gold or other commodities etc etc?

I didn't make it.

It's a visualisation of the Bitcoin's code development from 2009 to 2018.

Yeah the nominal values are gonna look huge to those who have been in since below $10k even though % wise the swings are similar than when it was below 10k. % volatility should decrease slowly over time and at the higher nominal values eventually. Interesting times...

So what happened to the GDAX chart for BCH/USD not showing yesterday's price action with the drop from $4000 area after the reopening of trade? I only see price action from the last 3 hours?
Most interesting...

Added a couple of screenshots. Difficult to find the balance between giving people a heads up for the sake of a heads up and adding to the FUD campaign.
Bluffing/double bluffing/collusion/greed/conspiracy etc. going around it seems. Was wondering at the time if the 'failed' November fork was in fact 'failed' and not perhaps a deliberate stall. None of it really matters methinks, best laid plans of mice and men and all that. Keep the tests coming for BTC, all good for immunization...
The truth lies somewhere in between greed and coordinated conspiracy I suppose.

HODL half of BTC stash long term, HODL half with the medium/longterm trend. BTC is still in a very clear uptrend from last year.
If/when this trend reverses at some stage and maintains a downtrend over several weeks/months, only then start to Dollar Cost Average swop out half of BTC position and adding to something like Stellar XLM while it has a long term uptrend against BTC. Once the BTC long term trend reverses upwards again then DCA back into BTC with this half from Stellar/preferred altcoin.
Don't fight the trend or try to pick tops or bottoms. My 2 satoshis anyway.
Edit: grammar and spelling

Ditto. WTF?! Looks like the parabolic is soon going to reverse time itself by bending left of straight up.

Bitcoin is messing with the time-space continuum... I'm scared, hold me...

Yip, and will likely encourage more anonymity being built into BTC code. The only short term vector (besides misinformation/spreading fud to slow adoption) they have right now that I can see is something along the lines of doing away with net neutrality and then targeting blockchain connections although this would likely not work for long anyway as the tech will adapt very quickly to move via a path of lesser resistance.
The knowledge of blockchain tech and its benefits are out there now, the ship has sailed and where they take one down 10 will replace it.

Bread wallet has worked well for me for over a year, make sure to write down and keep the passphrase safe so that the wallet can be recovered if anything happens to the phone.
At the moment it seems even riskier than normal to keep funds on an exchange for any length of time with the Tether issue not fully put to bed one way or the other yet.

Been thinking along similar lines for a while, although not sure if trouble is the right word, maybe just a readjustment of the way the economy works overall (shifting to a saver economy vs a spending one) and trouble for those businesses/economies that don't adapt to the change/shift. Printing more fiat and encouraging useless spending is just kicking the can down the road methinks.
Edit: autocorrect correction :)

Same thing hit me not long ago, light bulb moment. If nothing else cryptos are pushing back against the consumer mentality, will be interesting to see long term if this is a shift (seeing more and more people mentioning similar realizations) and if it might actually accelerate future fiat recessions as crypto adoption rises and people spend less and hodl more...
