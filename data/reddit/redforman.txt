@_date: 2014-10-10 05:50:43

then i guess we better get rid of the federal reserve and centralized banking if we want to keep the world safe from terror and financial crime.
@_date: 2015-01-19 23:52:25
lol even though centralized banking has been the cause of every war and funded every terrorist......

I thought don king died ?
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:31:21
Lol because ltc was not created by them. How are you going to profit if someone else created it. By creating your own with the bitcoin flag waving behind youre for sure going to win.

Yup. Tax is theft. Always has been. If you dont pay your taxes and they show up to your house with a armed law enforcment to seize your stuff..... its like putting lipstick on a pig. Dont make it any different. Still the same pig. Its theft.
@_date: 2018-04-08 12:43:40
Same reason why youre here commenting.
@_date: 2015-10-20 21:11:27

@_date: 2017-07-12 17:44:37

@_date: 2016-07-27 14:07:50
so let me get this straight. you find a problem but youre willing to exploit it for the sake of your own greed? so youre basically doing what centralized bankign is currently doing to us and were tryign to get away from.......idiot.
