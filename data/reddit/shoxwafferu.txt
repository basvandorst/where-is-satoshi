Before you posted your panic post, did you actually raise tickets with the appropriate exchanges? 
Posts with titles like this severely undermine your actual question. 


Relax dude.

Ah I see, I use an Australian OTC and they supply my coins within the hour lol. You Americans are mad lads waiting on five days for coins regardless of price hikes or not.

I constantly just put 200 a week into it regardless of the price. Been doing with Buyabitcoin for 2+ years now and it has never hurt me. It's more like my own personal savings account :D 
Edit: Just reread your question, only once I carried the max 8k and that was before the halving last year I think price was at $700 AUD and spike to 1,100 in a few weeks or so.

Just a normal bank deposit. So to the bank teller I just give them the account number and bsb. You get all the details after completing the order details on your email. Yeah it is slightly awkward carry 8k in cash and I wish they would allow efts as cash transactions may be difficult for some. But I guess it's more to not loose their bank accounts with large number of eft deposits.

Buy a Bitcoin. They do ask for id for large orders but it's a one off process I provided months back. And it's a 4.9% fee. But I always have been getting my coins within the hour. Their rate is slightly higher than btc markets. But when trying to buy alt coins and such in terms of speed I went with buyabitcoin.

Current Australian market is over 3200+ :) Hence I treating it as a small investment over a period of time def has helped me quite a bit.
