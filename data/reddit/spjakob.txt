Well... you seem to assume that there is something left when this is over... I think that would be the _good_ scenario.
From what I have read it looks like 125k BTC is gone, that could very well be everything that they had...

Posts like this makes me incredibly sad for two reasons;
First and most importantly it's an example of the heavy censorship going on, both on this forum and other places. It makes it VERY hard to find a good platform to discuss and come to the now famous "consensus". XT lovers have their forum and the XT haters have their...... and the community just keeps get further divided.
Other reason is when reading ppl:s comment on github etc. Many of the "leading" developers (nowdays) has a very strong (bad) attitude towards people who doesn't share their ideas. It seems like the personal relations between some developers has turned so bad that no matter what the other party says, any thoughts will be rejected just based on who said it... 
I think bigger block would be good, but I'm right now FAR more worried about the discussion climate. 
I have read the "roadmap statement" from many of the developers. I would LOVE to see a statement from the same developers about their view on censorship. If they send out a clear message that they are promote a free and open discussion (including implementations of BIP101 as an example), they would all gain A LOT of respect from me at least!!!!

Agreed...normally would I write that this can not go through and it will be revoked in a near future... but based on what has been going on for many months, nothing surprises me now.... 
Unfortunally, this is just the same thing that has been going on in this forum for many months now...... 
I just hope that the so called "core team" has little higher moral standards the the moderators of this reddit.
@_date: 2015-12-21 23:11:26
Oh... they are really doing a good work here then, since you don't even seems to be  aware of what is going on.... 
I could direct you to some other forums or reddits where you could read more about the now famous cencorship by theymos, however, this would probably get me banned.... and I'm afraid this post will be deleted soon and that I will be banned just for writing this....

But see this quote from original post (comments) regarding if they are "thinking about it" or "working":

Well, read the orignal post and comments by the poster. The news is that it's NOT an "engineer saying that they consider adding it to future plans".
The news is that the VP confirms that they have people working on it.
Sure, it could be a photoshopped screenshoot, but that's where I thought mainstream media would call someone on google to verify that the post was real. 
If it's real, I think it's HUGE news.

First: There is no "Nobel prize" in economics. Nobel was wise enough to only give prices for SCIENCE. 
This price was later "invented" by swedens national bank (if I recall correctly).
I do not know about this guy, but this price has really been handed out to people who have done extremly trivial resarch and findings. Things that would not even qualify for an article in a regular science paper.
For the first time in a veeeery long time we do actually have a good candidate for a "nobel price in economics". You all know who I'm talking about.... problem is just to find him.

I considerede donating money, but there is a few thing that made me decide not to and I will post the reasons here.
First, would I like to say that; YES I think this is a good cause and not any type of scam or anything like that. I'm NOT advicing against donating, I just explaining why it didn't make me send any btc.
The request should be better prepared! 
 - At least with a quote from a laywer. 
Do not ask as a private person! 
  - Make it clear that this is a defence fund and you will publicly publish statements.
Team up! 
   - This should be of interest of many others. Both companies and organizations! Both national and international.
Let someone else handle this! 
   - If this should be sponsored by the community. Ask a organization that you trust to handle the fundrasining and defence! Then will you just be one of the sponsors.

Isn't the headline COMPLETLY wrong? 
I found no proof that "10.000 online merchants accepts bitcoin", just that a payment service that has that many customers now has a working solution for bitcoin...... and I guess it's still up to each merchant to decide if they want to use that option! 
...or did I miss something?
In case headline is wrong; please try to post TRUE stories and statemetns, everything else will just hurt bitcoin! 
@_date: 2016-01-16 09:20:07
What we need to do is to move ahead and implement this! The problem is not the solutions proposed, the problem is that a few investors fear that this will divided/split bitcoin into two separate fractions and this causes them to sell... 
This is caused by lack of understanding on how such a hard fork would work and fired by the ppl calling efforts to increase blocksize is the same as creating an altcoin.
Sure; a hard fork is not undramatic, but I coinsider the alternative (to do nothing or just do minor things like SW) much, much worse in the long run...that's a dead end. From a pure investment perspective this is a worse scenario (in the long run!).
 
@_date: 2016-01-16 09:24:13
......one more thing;
As an investor; I would actually be more possitive now than ever, because it FINALLY seems like we are about to reach consensus/strong majority  (at least from miners and users, but also strong developer support) for a plan (bitcoin_classic) to solve the block size debate that has been the focus for a looooong time! 
I would be happier than ever as an investor! 
@_date: 2016-03-14 10:32:22
You claim about censorship in is just wrong. Yes, a lot of topics and posts get downvoted there, that many, including me think is legitimate. However, calling that censorship is not right.
What's going on here is much much worse, it's written in the policy to censor anything that promotes clients like classic. Custom CSS code is used to hide the censorship. 
The problem now is that there is so much hate that core supporters and classic (or other) supporters have stopped talk to each other in a civilized way. If I only read (which I think most core supporters do) I get the idea "...that classic is an altcoin developed by some inmature script kiddies who wants to destroy bitcoin". And if I only read (which I think most classic/other supporters do)  I get the idea "...that blockstream fully controls core and want to destroy bitcoin.". 
Neither is true.
However, if we can not find a platform to talk to each other things will most likely not get better. is not that platform and even this message could be deleted and I may be banned. This is why I hardly write here anymore.

So in short (regarding xt topic): 
I'm allowed to speak of xt (saying that I think the greatest solution in the world as example), links to news and information about xt as long as I or the links doesn't encourage anyone to actually start using it? 
Sorry for being a nitpick about this, but the rules you have could need some clarification since the result for breaking them is (potentially) a long ban.

Can you please explain if I'm allowed all mention the current patch that caused a heated debate recently by it's name in a comment in this thread?
If yes; am I allowed to say anything that I think is good about that patch or would it be consider "promoting" and be a cause for ban.

2. I can not trust this reddit for information anymore.

@_date: 2015-07-26 10:26:15
Great page, but I must say the page is a bit confusing. 
I don't think most users care about the number of tranactions in mempool etc. Most users would just like to know the following:
How much should fee should I use to get a confirmation in XX minutes?
Such a table would be _really_ useful(!!).
An option to switch between mBTC/satochi/BTC would be very good to match that of what MY client/wallet uses! 
.....and I apart from the suggestions below I will say that it would be nice with an additional really "superdumb" page like currentfee.cointape.com that displays ONLY (in a huge font) the suggested fee to get "instant" confirmation. :) 
This could be the de facto reference page that a lot of FAQ:s would point too.... ;) 
@_date: 2015-08-26 12:48:54

I have tried the option "sweep paper wallet" and it tells me that it will move ALL my bitcoins to my phone(?!?). This isn't really what I want, I just want to make a transaction (for SOME of the coins) using my private (paper) key.
@_date: 2016-02-24 12:17:34
I really doesn't see the logic in "that a fee market is needed to pay for the security of the network". Do ppl supporting this view think that there isn't a big enough drive/interest in mining bitcoins? 
Fee:s already generate a big additional income in addition to the reward. Why increase the miners income even more??? 
Oh wait, could it be that the ppl who agreed to keep blocksize at current level are miners and a bunch of ppl working for a company who has an alternative solution to move money around?

@_date: 2015-07-11 12:10:26
I understand your arguments and although I agree with them I must say that I rather reuse an address than having all my savings in a (quite unprotected) phone that I carry with me.
But there must be SOME easier way of doing  this when I want to "fill up" my spendings wallet that I have in my phone (together with private key). Seems odd that I MUST transfer everything just to transfer 95% of funds back.... :(

As I tried to explain, it's not about sweeping and importing ALL your BTC in a paper wallet. It's about sending a transaction from a watch only address that needs the private key (from your paper wallet) where the remaining BTC stays in the "watch only" wallet.
Issue has been confirmed by blockchain! The have just not fixed although a year has passed....
@_date: 2015-07-02 20:18:17

Why use mtgox when there are so many other sites around?
My experience is that is close to imposible to get money out wire, sepa (yes) and on some occations even transfering bitcoins out has been problematic.
I could actually live with that if just mtgox would tell the truth about there problems, instead of lying and making up various stories... 
However, that is just MY experience, but from what I found out on reddit and other places,  many share the same experience.
Just use another exchange!
@_date: 2013-11-06 13:40:35
Oh, had a friend who removed all his BTC from the yesterday and it worked ok.
However, I'm not supprised by this news and I would not be supprised to learn that mtgox filed for bancrupcy tomorrow either...

Do not trust ANYTHING that comes out of mtgox.
@_date: 2013-11-08 10:16:38
I honestly believe that mtgox does NOT have as much traffic as they claim and that much of their transactions is generated internally.
NOONE with a sane mind would use them if they have done a little research. They are lying, withholding critical information and there seems to be very few ways to get money of of mtgox. I have been waiting for months now (first wire, then I have changed to SEPA), but no money in my acount... :-(
The MAIN problem is NOT banks, it's MTGOX. If they just where OPEN about what the problem with was I would feel much more confident. Last time I checked (a few days ago), you could still make a "wire withdrawal" although the word from support is that this is not working.

I think main problem is not the long withdrawal times, it's the LIES and LACK OF INFORMATION coming from mtgox.

It will NEVER EVER use them again!
