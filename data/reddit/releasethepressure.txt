@_date: 2017-02-04 22:24:18


That's because you're using a debit/credit card. You can bank transfer transfer funds into your account via SEPA/SWIFT and purchase at a lower fee.
If you're in the UK open a [Fidor]( bank account. Transfer funds to them and then to an exchange like Kraken. Fidor only charge around £3 for SEPA transfers compared to £10+ with most other UK banks.

On iOS the best is Breadwallet and Android it's Mycelium. If you're spending 3k I'd recommend a hardware wallet such as the Ledger Nano S.

Well technically 'Beautiful UI' shouldn't be there as that choice cannot be objective. What you may consider a beautiful UI isn't going to be what others think. I'd weight it as 0 for scoring or remove it.

Bitcoins 'Killer App' will be reducing the barrier of entry. Right now it's relatively complicated for the average user to even acquire the currency never mind understanding how it works.

I would suggest the obvious that you don't buy 20k in one go. Perhaps 5k monthly. Plus if BTC takes a dip you are able to lower your overall cost per BTC.
Step 1: Register for Kraken and get verified to Tier 2
Step 2: Open an account with [Fidor Bank]( They let you do SEPA payments for around £2.50 (Cheapest in the UK by a mile) Transfer some money into Fidor.
Step 3: Do a transfer  of around 5k to your Kraken account and purchase from the exchange directly.
Unless you're actually money laundering there shouldn't be a problem.

Coinbase is another option

Where? This topic is related to MU2 and Bitcache. He hasn't delivered shit yet.

It's dropping because people are selling. 


your guess is as good as anyones. Maybe BTC will go to the moon or maybe it will crash and burn.
Is it likely to crash and burn? Probably not. Is it likely to continue on an upward trend in terms of value? Probably.
It's all speculative. No one knows.

The site is [painfully slow]( might want to sort that as I would normally have closed the tab after about 3secs waiting.
@_date: 2017-01-07 21:56:47
Nope, it can be used in many wallets :-)

They could just say they gave it away to someone and no one would be able to prove they did or didn't. Plus they have 40k followers to go before the draw...

Register for Kraken, verify to Tier 3 then deposit funds to the account via bank transfer. (Transfer cost depends on your bank)
But be prepared to wait a few days for verification.

Good call!

What price did you buy at?
@_date: 2017-01-17 17:54:15
was watching most, didn't see any cross 900 as of that post. Bitstamp has now.
@_date: 2017-01-17 23:00:25
Yeah same here, my name is on lots of bills but not my gas or electric. So no way to verify. Come on Gemini...
@_date: 2017-01-08 17:16:01
Nice, didn't know this! 
@_date: 2017-01-17 17:51:25
Premature... Nearly 900...
@_date: 2017-01-31 18:02:59
It's looking good! Nice prediction!

Fiverr doesn't tell HMRC anything. It's up to you to declare your earnings or not.

For a minute I thought you were OP, rage was rising lol

Typo on the 100... ;-)
@_date: 2017-01-20 08:50:24
Because he's full of shit
@_date: 2017-01-04 16:14:42
It clearly says PayPal sells...

Nobody knows, if they did they'd be either buying as much as they can get their hands on or not touching it with a barge pole.

Even if it can't be banned, a country can still make it illegal. So if you were in possession or trading in BTC you could face fines / prison. This creates uncertainty.

Buy in smaller chunks over the day
