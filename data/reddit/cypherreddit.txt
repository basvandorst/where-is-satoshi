The post from the guy in Nepal praising BTC, he was making a sound argument, as he specified circumstances.
A quick look at OPs history shows that he lives in Brazil. You can get prepaid credit cards in Brazil. Brazil does have modern banking infrastructure or financial instruments, such as credit cards. Maybe not as robust as some other countries, but nonetheless.

Btc has lots of legal uses. Btc has lots of illegal uses. Just like fiat. Typically businesses do not want their legal business put at liability for transacting with an illegal business.

There is no point in a DMCA form and a TOS entry. It wouldn't save them from legal liability since its the operators knowingly are violating copyright as part of their primary operation.

All Bitcoin transactions are public record. Every knows his wallets and a lot of people are watching, probably with automatic alerts set. It doesn't matter how you mix them, they can be followed. If you take them to a mixing service and they accept them, it would make them a target of a murder investigation, along with everyone else that used that service, also would be damn near impossible to take care of that amount all at once and each time you use a mixing service that chances of getting caught get increased. Switching to an altcoin wont help either, same issues, public record and too much to move.
The theft of Satoshi Nakamoto's bitcoin after his murder would be dreadfully hard to capitalize on, since the public nature of bitcoin transactions, the amount needed to move and being the target of bitcoin developers, intelligence services, financial investigators and regular police.
The amount you could reasonably make off the murder without getting caught makes it not worthwhile as there are easier crimes, with less jail-time and less risk.

Nothing, but currently all the donations are going directly to Coinbase ~~with CB taking a generous fee.~~ 
They should have put a private wallet between them and their fiat convertor to avoid liability issues. Now CB now has to close the account or risk liability and the website operator has ~~lost unneedfully lost a portion of donation funds and~~ had his name exposed as the website owner exposed publicly.
The point is, if you aren't conducting legitimate business, don't deal directly with legitimate companies. 
~~But even in this case, using coinbase for donation collections is stupid~~

I don't understand why they didn't just create an address and post that either. It would have saved them the Coinbase transaction fees and kept the owner anonymous.
I don't know about CB but PP is certainly overzealous when it comes to freezing and closing accounts. Companies like this have to be. Any kind of serious investigation by investigators would cost them more money than they would lose for simply by refusing to do business with them. All merchant processors are this way, unless they are in jurisdictions with liberal laws or are willing to take the increased risk with even higher fees.

Only a small advantage. Since the business is accepting bitcoin, it can directly give its employees some of those coins without conversion to fiat and back. So the business saves a fee as does the employee. Also for practical purposes it can be a pain to convert fiat to coin and back due to limitations in amounts or time of fiat transfers.
more significantly, if the business or employee are in an area where inflation is rampant or the currency is not widely accepted internationally, maybe even locally, bitcoin may be a good alternative

I totally agree, other than for money transfers, currency exchanges and remittances, Bitcoin has little use for people that normally deal with widely accepted currencies.
It is the most advantageous for those in countries that are largely restricted to an unstable currency, non-widely accepted currency and/or have poor/little/strict banking infrastructure.
Getting the majority of South America, Africa, and South Asia to use Bitcoin would give Bitcoin real strength however the technological aspect is limiting market reach. Either smart phones need to become ubiquitous nearly everywhere in the world with reliable internet service or a simpler secure alternative needs to be found (SMS-based services are not secure).
I believe until we have that technological saturation, those with stable currencies will continue to use them due to ease, acceptance and stability; and those with less fungible currencies or strict banking access with limited technological support will still use local fiat due to access and ease with the hope of occasionally converting to and from BTC to bank or exchange.
Bitcoin would be transformative for places [like Somaliland where 100USD requires a wheelbarrow to transport]( but the technological infrastructure isn't there

The transactions are anonymous until they hit known wallets. In our case the starting wallets are very well know. Anyone can follow the blockchain of transactions, even you by visiting  for example. Investigators just need to follow the transactions until they start hitting known wallets, that means almost all of the major exchanges and practically all retail businesses. Most likely the first person they investigate wouldn't be the thief but that person can lead the investigators to the previous unknown wallet in the transaction log, which might be a person, a service or whatever. If its an anonymous service, they might hit a dead-end if there are no logs and the thief only used it once, but the investigators can watch for future transactions through that service or seize it all together. 
The big thing is that Nakamoto is so high profile that murdered, his coins would likely be automatically tracked with publicly available means, any sensible person would avoid transacting (probably automatically) with those tainted wallets if at all possible just to avoid being part of a high profile murder investigation.

There have been reasonably close examples of ANCAP societies. You can look at the ANCAP article on wikipedia for examples, I would include the Kowloon walled city as a modern example.
I really can't give you any examples of accessible power checks that would work on the scale of today's societies. Governments have their own obvious issues and assassination markets are worthless if you don't have a target. It was a very common practice to grab a target in the night, take them out somewhere remote and kill them if they were an issue in a society without a central authority. But those societies capped out at 10k populations with good reason. But even if we take a small scale society, where centralized authority has no real power we can still see the issue. For example, Pitcairn Island.
The island has a population of 47 (in 2004), and an even smaller coverage in square kilometers. In 2004 nearly a quarter of the population was charged with raping a quarter of the population (girls pregnant at 12 years old was common) for several decades. Nothing could be done locally, the British basically formally annexed the island and had New Zealanders oversee an investigation and trial.

really easy too, just buy a domain and have the catch-all picked by your favorite email service.

as a consumer, I will choose whatever payment option saves me money
if BTC is the cheapest, I'll use that. Otherwise I'll pay with CC to get a percentage of cash back, unless you have a cash discount.
If you aren't interested in BTC but want to give customers the option, no reason to incentive it, so yes do whatever you feel comfortable with, including charging a bit more.

or maybe its a promotion to rekindle the interest of customers they lost in the past and to spark the interest of the chinese customers they can gain

Blackmarket websites


not if you have a japanese bank account, you know, the country they are based in




see my previous response, they are the biggest for a reason


all of the services have issues, especially when they have to deal with foreign banks. you have the international banking system to thank for that


you can say that about any service that holds your cash and doesn't give you reasonable interest


it will effectively kill bitcoin and the operators will have to flee for their lives as some people will have lost millions

overstock isnt going to rebuild their payment system around an opensource one, they are going in-house so they can add a payment option to their current system
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:26:37
the cost of doing that is astronomical

people that have received the mail should start naming which services they use so we can figure out the responsible party

You cousin may not understand the technology of bitcoin, but you don't seem to understand that bitcoin can be effectively regulated by governments to near pointlessness for 99% of the people

as a consumer, I would want to to price them in USD based on current rate. while market volatility is calming down, its still too great to price things any differently and its fair to everyone involved and your non-bitcoin customers.

also a number of people can't get bank accounts

no it isn't. its not an essential service to provide all potential customers merchant payment processing accounts.

doesn't matter. most of the time its out of the county anyway
I think 60 minutes tried to follow the trail on this scam, they found the rube, got the forwarding address in a west african country, had the rube mail the package with a tracking device. They flew there to arrive as the same time as the package. They staked out the airport waiting for the fraudster to show, never happened. When they went to inspect the package at the airport, it was an empty box with a tracking device in it.
If shipping in the same country, you just have the packages delivered to an empty house. Stakeouts are easy to spot in many neighborhoods.

fraudsters just to rubes as a go-between.
fraudster finds a rube on the internet, says he has a no risk business venture for him. Tells rube that he needs to accept packages, re box them and ship them overseas. That's all and he will get a lot of money. Rube does this for fraudster. Fraudster buys stuff with stolen card shipped to rube, rube ships to fraudster.

if you are concerned someone is going to hack your gmail, that has double authentication, then trading and buying bitcoin might not be for you, especially since the major exchanges have been hacked and people have lost money

the seller pays the taxes in her local currency, unless its property tax, then the buyer pays the taxes in their local currency. Its a non-issue really, you just have to convert to local currencies, just like you do with any other foreign currency

Coinbase is accessible and easy to use for late US bitcoin adopters


Mint is great for people that have many accounts and as aggregate data it doesn't give much more information than your credit report. If someone is looking into individually, then it doesn't really matter anyway.


privacy concerns is a silly reason to be into bitcoins
@_date: 2013-12-22 19:29:15
yep, basically China just helped make so wealth can only enter china from bitcoin and not exit. 
in otherwords; 'we will be happy to take your non-chinese wealth, but you cannot take our chinese wealth'

how about merchants just do whatever they feel comfortable with
@_date: 2013-12-23 19:41:07


wasn't this due to undeniably illegal activity?


~~wouldn't he be considered an unlicensed money transmitter~~


isn't this good news (if true) as that means bitcoin is a recognized currency


this seems to be a broad statement. but it seems like they are just making people operate with proper licenses

make an SMS based system that can run on just about any cellphone and you are pretty much good to go. except that sms has no security and can be easily intercepted...

lol, are you delusional, they are paying a 13 billion dollar fine to the US Gov, the paltry bitcoin market is barely a blip to them
