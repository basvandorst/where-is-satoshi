So 0.0017271157 BTC fee per transaction? That's $18.69 per transaction.
@_date: 2019-07-03 03:12:29
If some paid .05, some would have to pay over $18
@_date: 2019-08-11 00:11:34
Shut up and take my sats

You can buy from an exchange like coinbase, or buy locally with wallet marketplaces or local bitcoins. To make sure you aren't getting scammed, meet IN PERSON, pay for your coins, and stay until the transaction is confirmed. 
A well known exchange won't scam you.

Buy bch off me? I'm not an exchange. What is your deal? I was literally just suggesting accepting bch alongside btc so if people chose to, they could use it.

What obscene content? It's a pic of buffet with a quote. The post has over 100 upvotes, you community has spoken. They want this content. Let it stay! Pretty please! I'll give you 1,000 satoshis!
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:07:53
Setup on another exchange and buy with a card.
@_date: 2019-06-29 19:50:56
Have you considering accepting BCH as well? Less fees for your customers.
@_date: 2019-06-27 04:55:44

I'm not trying to get into a coin war, both have next to no transaction fee, I just suggested bcash because it came to mind.
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:22:30
It’s literally called crypto*currency*.

Just buy dips. Bitcoin is a long term game.
@_date: 2019-06-27 04:33:46
I sold at 20 something... 30 fucking coins. I don't live one day without severe regret.
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:40:11
Bitcoin is money. Assuming you mean traditional currency?
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:22:00
Sold this morning, not out of panic but because I thought the price would keep falling. Regardless... how bad did I fuck up? And is there a way to trade with credit on coinbase so I can buy without waiting 4 days for my money?
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:47:30
Don't assume stuff! I love the idea of decentralized currency! I'm just talking about the investment side of it!
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:58:03
Even if I re enter at 4400 I'll be ahead. I bought right before the dip. I just hope I'll have my money by then
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:47:57
I've only invested what I can lose, so yeah. I hope it becomes primary currency. 
What do you think this dip will go down to? Is china really the only thing causing this dip right now?
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:02:01
There are plenty of easy to use applications that will keep track of average cost for you.
No, not sooner than I expect, never. I'm smart with my money and keep track of it.
Until dollars actually don't matter, you should count them. I bet your attitude towards this would change if someone offered to buy a Bitcoin from you for $10,000 and only gave you $1. You would probably strangle them if they said "Bitcoin is about the transition to the future when Dollar doesn't matter anymore. Cheers." 
Please don't dish out financial advice unless you are in a position to do so. I assume your main investment is Bitcoin? Your investment is doing well right now, shut up.
@_date: 2017-09-08 23:01:01
You guys keep saying that... and I hope you are all right. This is definitely my most daring hold ever.
@_date: 2017-09-07 02:36:37
He said he was kicking himself...
@_date: 2017-09-08 23:03:51
Thank you. People saying "just HODL" aren't the same people that just bought for the first time right before the drop. I bough all my coins in the 4500-4700 range. I'm cutting my losses at 3500.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:23:03
Glad I cashed out at $3900. That's all I'm gunna say.
@_date: 2017-09-07 04:33:56
....He said he was kicking himself...
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:29:11
Doesn't mean I want to lose my money... cutting my losses isn't something I want to do either. BUT I'd rather lose some than all. I don't want to be holding Bitcoin if it hits $0. Just because I believe in it doesn't mean the rest of the world will accept it. 
I'd rather sell, wait for good news, and buy at an improved position.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:32:23
You don't have to keep track of every purchase. It's (your total purchase amount)/( number of shares purchased). That figure just says how good your investment is, that's all. 
Edit: in this case it's btc not shares
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:05:24
Zooming out to when I purchased doesn't make me feel any better.
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:45:27
I've only noticed the two dollar buy fee on coin exchange. But all good advise, thank you!
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:06:44
So how do I transfer my coins and to where?
@_date: 2017-09-06 20:39:17
Was talking about this last dip.
@_date: 2017-09-06 23:30:34
When was this? I hope not recently?
@_date: 2017-09-26 21:16:09
The prices had me tripped up until I read comments to find out it's old.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:27:23
Went great. Price fell more today. Now I can improve my position if I see Bitcoin going back up.
Never sell is bad advice in an unregulated market.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:24:42
You're giving financial advise and you don't even know what your average cost is?

Finally, someone that realizes this.

What? Like which ones?
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:46:31
Yeah, it tells you how well your investment is doing. If you don't know it, you don't know if you are upside down.
And I'm not saying I'm a financial adviser, I'm simply saying that you don't seem to be in a position to give advice either. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:44:24
If it's till going down, wouldn't it be better to sell and buy lower?
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:05:46
Thank you.
@_date: 2017-09-09 18:03:05
Where does 10k come from? I keep hearing that.
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:04:15
That's what I'm hoping!
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:26:09
I did, it has dropped $30 so far. AAAAGGHHH
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:16:17
I sold this morning. Hoping price falls until I get my $$ to buy said cheaper coins.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:29:11

I knew buying the dip was too good to be true... now the question is how low will it go?
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:34:57
So much for me finally making a good investment.

What is your opinion on all of this craziness? HODL?
Edit: I purchased at 4560, 4600, and 4650 after the dip.
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:13:39
I ended up selling, using that money for another investment, made a quick buck, and bought Bitcoin after JP Morgan dissed it. So no i didn't HODL. And I learned to not listen to a bunch of people i don't know on the internet.
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:49:18
I can't afford much either. I buy in $50 increments, and I can afford another up on bitcoin so I want to buy deep in this dip, I'm just horrible at timing these kinds of purchases.
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:46:36
Transparent lambo? I can dig it.

Oh course I have no fucking money to buy right now.
@_date: 2017-09-13 23:10:48
In the summer of 2012 (almost 100% sure on year) I worked on my grandfathers fishing boat. He had Bloomberg and I took up reading it. There was an article about how Bitcoin was a pyramid scheme, and how you should avoid it. 
I. Fucking. Loved it.
I wanted to sink my entire $1300 paycheck into Bitcoin but my grandfather refuses to pay me until I swore I wouldn't.
Biggest regret of my life.
Edit: I was 15. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 03:29:27
I'm not trying to! I thought he accidentally bought some over priced shit on the dark web... or something...
