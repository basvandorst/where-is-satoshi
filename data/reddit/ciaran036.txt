That is a feature of the culture here but that was accidental ��.

Does it have to be on a credit card? For my own credit cards, cryptocurrency purchases are blocked. If they weren't blocked, I'm sure it would trigger the cash advance fees. 
Why can't you use a bank account or debit card (checking account)?

Can you break this down further? I used Samourai app recently to hold some Bitcoin. Is the developer looking at someone else's wallet app?

Why should it? Haven't we all been completely disregarding his tweets as senile old man racist, childish nonsense? 
This tweet is hardly any different.

I'm new to this, but I don't think it *will* drop below £8k / $10k.

In the UK, Lloyds have barred credit card payments for cryptocurrencies but it is allowed for debit cards. Which makes sense to be honest, people probably shouldn't be using credit to invest in Bitcoin.

Other big bosses in Citigroup have been saying the same thing for ages. James Cowles, CEO of EMEA said more or less the same thing in a similar forum a few months back.

Well my initial thoughts are that surely the exchanges would prevent this but then I remembered that it would actually benefit the exchanges if this was happening... 
Then I wonder if there is regulation in place for it, but I guess maybe not, I'm not aware of any such regulation in the UK.
I've only used one exchange so far and it didnt appear to have anything in place to prevent automated trades happening once logged in..

I got that part, but why is it spelt wrong? Cheers

Although in the UK that appears to be changing as the banks have cut funding for ATM's leading to charges at many ATM's. Seems to me that they are looking to push people towards cashless transactions.

Many of the ATM's in my city that were previously free now have £2 fees.
