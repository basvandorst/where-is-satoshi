Weird, this sounds like free money, yet my internal scam alarm won't stop ringing.....
Also, when did Ponzi find bitcoins?

isn't the key difference that if he robs the bank, the deposits are guaranteed to the depositors still?
As opposed to a wallet?

what the fuck? ZIGGAP looks like the most obvious pyramid scheme I've ever seen.
"Want to make 20% of our profits? Join our affiliate program! We're accepting a limited number of affiliates at this time. 
If you are interested please create an account and submit a support ticket. Did I mention that you get 20%?
BUT WAIT. THERE'S MORE! You also get 20% of the 20% of profit from sales for any affiliate under you. And this stacks. Forever. "

I'm talking specifically about the affiliate program they have.
**"You also get 20% of the 20% of profit from sales for any affiliate under you. And this stacks. Forever."**
It may just be Multi level marketing, but a fine line.
edit: also there are many types of pyramid schemes. And just because it provides a service in some regard does not mean its *primary* concern is enrolling more people in its affiliate program.
