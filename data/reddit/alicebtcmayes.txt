Obviously a dump scam. But it failed because the community isn't stupid, just look at the price!
I would like the big exchanges with him as a customer to come out and confirm or deny that he actually sold. I'll bet you he sold nothing.

I **personally** experienced a double-spend loss that would have been prevented by this patch. It might not help Bitzillions directly yet, but don't let perfect be the enemy of good.
Also to those reading this, remember this is Greenaddress, the guys who hired Peter Todd who is busy attacking zeroconf. Just a coincidence that double-spends make their centralized wallet business profitable!

Yes I have. It's a whole bunch of bickering rather than Actually Fixing Shit.
See [this comment]( in opposition to the removal:


Fact is the people behind all that bickering write almost no code and spend all their time arguing with the people who do. It's a very sick culture.

Don't play dumb.

Confirmations can take over an hour. That is unacceptably long for a in-person trade. Stick your head in the sand if you want to, but if Bitcoin doesn't fix this issue in a decentralized way an alt with a faster block interval will eat it's lunch. (*cough* doggycoin) I'm just trying to raise awareness and help Bitcoin and all I seem to get is hate.
@_date: 2014-06-19 13:24:09
So why not let your efforts compete in the marketplace rather than paying people to fight the decentralized competition?
@_date: 2014-09-22 16:54:27
That debate isn't a "silly political battle", blockchain bloat is a very real issue for the decentralized future of Bitcoin you claim to care about.
Why don't you go and post the IRC log of the [core developers]( EDIT: [censored and reposted]( discussing stealth addresses and coming to consensus that your design is harmful to Bitcoin **and** finding a better way to do it and offering to merge that way into Bitcoin?
Or do you just want to play politics on behalf of your blockchain bloating clients?
@_date: 2014-07-21 08:13:11
I saw that. Obvious back peddling now that his conflicts of interest have been exposed.
The double-spend was with Android Wallet, so giving you the txid is a privacy issue. With the hate coming from you people I'm not going to take that risk.

Gavin showed the the resource attacks required unrealistic amounts of txouts:






















He also showed how miners have big incentives to follow the same rules:


Miners also have the incentive to make their coins valuable. Junk altcoins like doggycoin look a lot more attractive if Bitcoin can't do fast confirms so rational miners will keep up to date. During an update merchants can take additional temporary precautions, or better yet the core dev team can co-ordinate rule changes via the majority upgrade mechanism.
@_date: 2014-07-21 08:18:44
Bitcoin depends on a majority of miners being honest after a confirm. But before your first conf your risk is the % of dishonest miners. So if you have a 8% dishonest pool who isn't following the Bitcoin Core rules like Eligius you have at worst a 8% chance of double-spend.
Other than Eligius there aren't any dishonest miners known so its just down to people broadcasting two transactions at once. A transaction gets around the network in seconds, so if nodes forward double-spends and the merchant just waits 10-30 seconds they can be very sure that the transaction will go through.
Double-spend notifications aren't 100% of the solution, but they are a **huge** improvement. Also, if you are a miner on Eligius, STOP MINING THERE. It is a fact that they've been a big part of the problem by accepting transactions that other pools do not rather than following the latest Bitcoin Core rules.
@_date: 2014-06-19 13:29:28
It's not about them stealing, it's about central control of your money. You won't be able to transaction without paying fees to them and Coinbase if they're transaction confirmation catches on.
@_date: 2014-07-21 08:56:05
Don't let perfect be the enemy of good.
Gregory Maxwell outlined an attack, but forgot to mention it is only possible due to dishonest and/or lazy miners who aren't keeping up to date with Bitcoin Core and are accepting a different set of transactions than other miners. A tx just takes seconds to get to near 100% of the network even right now, and with improvements like mempool synchronization that time will be reduced even further.
@_date: 2014-06-19 13:18:07
Why? I thought it was a very clever idea to help the honest majority keep Bitcoin safe.
@_date: 2014-07-21 08:08:01
Peter demonstrated double-spends by exploiting non-standard transactions. Community pressure on mining pools to mine honestly and keep their Bitcoin version up to date will get rid of that vulnerability. Right now Eligius is the main attacker BTW if you are a miner. So leave Eligius!
There isn't going to be one solution all at once. So stop pretending there is just to push your centralized crap.
@_date: 2014-06-19 13:32:05
That's giving up on decentralized Bitcoin for retail! Micropayment channels require big centralized micropayment channel providers you know that run the show.
@_date: 2014-06-19 13:28:36
Yes you did. I heard you quite clearly hiring the guy at Amsterdam. Of course you're going to deny it now that it's all so obvious.
@_date: 2014-06-19 13:13:46
Do you think he actually needs to get things through directly? The example with getutxos seems to be just using obstructionism to get a good idea delayed as long as possible.
Also I understand that his 0 confirmation double-spends were using tricks like taking advantage of the fact that Eligius is trying to attack gambling sites. That isn't a trick that will last for long as defenses like coinbase reallocation are added and miners self-regulate more. Also look at him bribing miners to double-spend and sybil attacking the network with his replace-by-fee nodes to bypass the Core Devs rejection of his replace-by-fee.
edit: Also like what I'm saying is that while GreenAddress's guaranteeing proposal might seem reasonable it isn't going to make them money unless they make zeroconf insecure. So it's pretty obvious to me that he's getting paid to break it by sybil attacking the network and bribing miners. Obviously something GreenAddress and Coinbase would much rather have him to on their behalf.
@_date: 2014-11-20 07:47:00
Peter's incentives here are anything but honest. He's been railling against Gavin Andresen's scaling efforts since forever, and even more recently Wladimir's competent and drama-free core maintainership. Pretty obvious why though given his off-chain clients benefit directly from transaction fees going up.
Just another sad attempt of his to gum up Bitcoin Core development any way possible.
@_date: 2014-07-21 08:20:22
Not only tools! Mr. Todd runs a whole bunch of nodes that are sybil attacking the network to help people get double-spends to unsuspecting miners. His tools only work because of miners who aren't keeping up to date, or worse are ignoring the Bitcoin Core rules entirely.
@_date: 2014-06-20 11:03:06
How you of all people get accused of "hidden biases" and other B.S. is amazing to me. Thank you for being such a moderate voice in a sea of immature fanboys! Any other leader would have kicked Peter out of the project long ago for his obvious money-driven biases and that you haven't simply blocked him already is a remarkable display of openness. I was reading the posts from last year on the blocksize thing as well and it's so clear his goal is to obstruct anything to push his otherwise uncompetitive ideas and clients.
Again, thank you for your work!

Yes I do. I was ripped off not long ago by someone who I think used Peter Todd's double-spend tool buying some Bitcoins in a person to person exchange. Not a lot of money fortunately, about 250mBTC I remember. With double-spend notifications that just would not have happened.
With BitPay that is exactly the issue. Coinbase has turned double-spends into a way of forcing you to use their big centralized wallet if you want to send money fast. BitPay is planning on offering the same thing with the micropayment channels Jeff Garzik is working on. Pretty obvious the incentives are dirty here. I personally witnessed Coinbase hire Peter Todd, whose been attacking zeroconf since forever.

Getting downvoted by those with their heads in the sand is my guess.
Basically I met a guy right at the the end of my local Bitcoin meetup who wanted to sell some Bitcoins. I hadn't seen the guy before and he said he had to catch a train so I accepted without a confirmation. Twenty minutes later I saw that it had been double-spent in my wallet.
Not a huge amount of money for me, but boy is that turn-off! I don't want to be using localbitcoins or an exchange for the obvious privacy reasons.
