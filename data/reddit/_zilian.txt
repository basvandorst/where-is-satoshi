Another idea : donate money to researchers who fight autoimmune diseases in a transversal way. All autoimmunes disorders seem to find a link in the digestive system. However they are tackled individually, mostly. I was recently diagnosed with spondyloarthritis, an AI disorder which attacks your articulations and induce severe pain to young people of 20 to 30 yo. It's incurable (for now) and lasts all your life...
Anyway, autoimmune disorders affects hundreds millions of people worldwide, an estimated 20% of the US population and are the next big fight in health after cancer. They are disease who do not get a lot of press coverage but can wreck your life in many ways. They are, quite literally a PITA.
I give money in my limited means but your contribution would mean a lot. I will try to help you find the most qualified research centers that accept BTC (I know a few but unfortunately they don't seem to accept BTC).

It would be good to donate to an organization dealing with domestic violences. Keep up the good work

You're mixing Spanish and French

Mostly it's one of those words that will get pronounced as in English

Sure, but as stated by ButterflySammy, some stores are pretty strict (apple for instance). With jailbreak, maybe.

I don't get your point. What about developers who feed their families with their apps?
@_date: 2013-02-25 11:02:34
What exactly can your add-on access? It says it can access the tabs I'm browsing. And all the data from reddit, and Mtgox.

I like this counter-proposal. It benefits from the "new product" effect. Counter-counter-proposal : how about a market for most "open" OS such as Firefox OS / Android / etc.. ? 
@_date: 2013-12-04 09:05:12
Wow, thank you very much! :)
@_date: 2013-02-25 11:42:39
I think anyone on the Internet for more than a year knows that a message with ten prices and 20 stars is a scam :)
@_date: 2013-02-25 11:40:52
I don't think Google, owner of Google wallet, would approve that?
@_date: 2013-02-25 12:15:50
This is no secret to me that the  Apple world is closed as hell! That's why I choosed Android, mainly. But I still think Google would dislike strongly as they wouldn't take their share
@_date: 2013-02-25 13:51:59
Didn't know that, thank you!
@_date: 2013-03-01 20:05:34
Why everybody believe in a $1000 price at some point? do you have any link? 
@_date: 2013-12-05 01:39:26
Next time!

Hey actually you still can, just click the little arrow on the left to extend the charity section! If you meant why EFF is not available, well I guess it just happens sometimes but they'll be back soon for sure.

And how are people going to enter into BTC where early users are rich/powerful? This is the weakness. This seems to be no better that fiat currencies : humans are just humans. How many bought BTC as a speculation tool and how many will exit BTC if they gain let's say, 200%?
@_date: 2013-03-01 20:29:14
You think banks would collaborate with BTC. I say it's thinking too fast, bank have no interest in this
@_date: 2013-03-01 20:06:26
Excellent point. I've read something similar on an obscure blog called "fate of bitcoin" or something. Are you the blogger? hehe
@_date: 2013-02-26 13:31:50
Yeah, yeah. "lots of businesses are lies". Next one is "money is a lie" and after that, "the system is a lie". 
We all know that. But still, in a lot of domains paid software is better than free/open-source software
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:02:48
Maybe I'll realize that too in two years but who cares? Money is defined by what it's worth at time t = now ;)
@_date: 2013-02-25 08:51:15
Never heard about it! Seems kinda limited though?
@_date: 2013-02-25 12:05:33
Based on this, I like this API idea.
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:55:52
I figured ! + 5 bitcoin
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:01:14
But they're still there on the Humble Store
@_date: 2013-02-25 12:46:23
Yeah, that's actually very surprising. 
@_date: 2013-02-25 12:36:29
Thanks for the answer. Here is what it says now : 
Still, gonna trust you on that. 
Is the code on github or something? :)
@_date: 2013-12-04 12:23:02
It worked! I checked the documentation and you have to write BTC instead of the symbol you used. Thank you so much! I'll give a bit more to charities.
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:19:11
I'm kind of a broke student but I always save a couple euros for the Humble Bundles. I just love the mix of indie games + charity support : 
I've bought a really tiny amount of BTC recently to try it out, and I must say the most surprising moment is when you actually use it :  *wow, I actually just bought something, it was easy - and it didn't require a bank.*
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:53:22
I never had a BTC tip :(
@_date: 2013-02-25 13:46:16
I'm not good enough with Android programming for the API, I think. 
I also agree on the complexity of the tasks - a few motivated developers/marketers would be great!
@_date: 2013-02-26 06:25:04
Well it's up to you I guess : because BTC users are concerned with privacy, you may create an account that stores what you bought, but if you don't want, it's your job to back it up?
Interesting question, I'll think about it
@_date: 2013-03-01 19:59:45
Easy... for Americans :/
