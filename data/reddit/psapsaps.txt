I still have the quote page open. All I can see in the "Amount you will receive" column is the already publicly-listed amount of dollars that will be exchanged for bitcoins after publicly-listed fees; let's call this amount `dollars_exchanged`.
I'm fine with that, but it's not quite the same as an estimation of how many BTC will be received; let's call the actual amount of bitcoins received `bitcoins_received`.
Thus, the average exchange rate that I ultimately receive is: `average_rate = dollars_exchanged / bitcoins_received`.


This is good to know.
That means I should be able to compare `average_rate` to all of the instantaneous exchange rates of the historical MtGox trading data ([accessible as per the instructions here]( from some time before the time on my receipt of payment (printed at the payment location) to the time the bitcoin transaction was first received by the network (as shown by, say, blockchain.info); if `average_rate` is greater than every instantaneous exchange rate in that data set, then the `average_rate` must be too large.
Is that correct?
If I can show this is true, would you even bother crediting me the difference, or would you just foist the blame onto MtGox?

Charlie Shrem (ultimately compensated me more than what I thought I was still owed, and for that I thank him; I feel that my personal matter has been satisfied amicably.
I still believe that there are strange discrepancies in the data I've seen, which have not yet been accounted for, and I hope Charlie looks into it for the sake of his otherwise valuable company; I wouldn't want BitInstant to be blamed for the errors (or *malice*) of another party in the pipeline.
In any case, I would currently still feel comfortable using BitInstant.

[I'M LOOKING AT THE FUCKING DATA.](


This is not what I'm saying.

Allow me to repeat myself:


So... nope.

I'll send you the BTC amount I think I'm still owed and the relevant address in a private message right after I finish writing this comment.
To figure out what I'm still owed, I tried to be as reasonable for all parties involved as possible. I averaged all 52 instantaneous MtGox exchange rates in a 139-second window that
* starts 10 seconds before the second in which my receipt was printed at the payment location
* and ends 9 seconds after the second in which the transaction to my bitcoin address was received by the bitcoin network.
Let's call that average `proper_rate`. I then found `rate_difference = average_rate - proper_rate`. Thus, `dollars_overpaid = rate_difference * bitcoins_received`, so that I'm still owed `bitcoins_owed = dollars_overpaid / proper_rate`.

I'm speaking specifically about the cash-to-bitcoin-address service. Have you had problems with that service?

You will never be satisfied short of scanning receipts, etc.
However, your skepticism isn't worth anything, while my PSA is.

I don't think you understand this submission, or what has been said in comments.

Nope. [There is hard data to look at]( and in my case, there was a clear discrepancy.
(As an aside, my calculations don't account for MtGox's trading fee or miner transaction fee, but factoring in the maximum possibilities for those makes little difference).

I think you are the one who is missing [what is plainly obvious]( Try again?

Where is anyone complaining about it being 'too complicated'? What are you going on about? Go back into your cave.
