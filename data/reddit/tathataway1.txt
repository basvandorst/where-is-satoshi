The billionaires do have vested interest in keeping sheep, sheep if you know what I mean. Honestly I hate calling people sheep, but kinda applying some constructive criticism. Some may very well be content and just say baaaa too. Let life live, I think John McAfee says that. Say your piece and also entertain thoughts... If the billionaires value goes to 0 some say they will be in fallout bunkers setting off nukes.

Another pump and dump I call them.

Any bank story will be suppressed naturally. Just another reason we know "we" are the Bank. Also shows you who don't want you see "we" want to be free.

Good advice for newer people if you see someone bashing something buy what they are bashing it may be a manipulation technique. Term of the day DYOR.

Boy thats some fancy debt.
@_date: 2019-08-12 03:27:54
Never did it yet but [bitcoin.com]( has buy with credit/debit card from the main page, working with simplex.
@_date: 2019-08-24 23:25:49
So the Ravoli 120,000 satoshi, fresh long cut/sauces would be roughly 80,000 satoshi atm.
@_date: 2019-08-22 03:08:58
Bet thats one reason satoshi/s don't reveal. BTC was made for US not IT.
@_date: 2019-10-25 19:17:14
that was a profitable dip no?
@_date: 2019-10-23 23:41:28
That edit tho made my day man thanks...

As peer to peer gets better and better it will do less and less damage my guess.
@_date: 2019-10-26 00:55:45
6k more is nothing right?

I like his analogy its like a bow and arrow the farther you pull back the stronger it is. Honestly people this price is inevitable and just the beginning.

Put prices in satoshi true vision for the coin.
@_date: 2019-10-27 01:47:53
Some nodes may even be in protective cases now to fight against such damage.

Yes a man that is wealthy likes to give rather than just be a whale. Rare breed and the world needs more of. He actually gets satisfaction HELPING others. He gives "HANDS UP" "OPPORTUNITIES" rather than just hand outs. Love seems to be a form of currency to him indeed. In a way you can see it as that no?
@_date: 2019-12-02 23:19:46
I didnt want to.... kinda last resort we all know where btc is headed.
@_date: 2019-12-03 13:29:45
It's the legal age of btc to drink.

@_date: 2019-09-20 18:37:01
If it collapses you know the people that have the power to print the paper shit most worship? They will TRY to substitute that shit with some kind of crypto shit they control. Main reasons some say BTC is not mainstream yet is all hail the paper overlords the masses understand and operate and are PROGRAMMED with. Be Alive Never Knowing Shit. Mark me many will follow...

Nothing wrong with one day a loaf of bread will cost 1 satoshi instead of saying 1 dollar...satoshi is still fractal bitcoin.

Sooo Argentinians are millionairs? Or do they know the ARP is inflated shit too?
@_date: 2019-09-20 01:59:14
I dream the word satoshi used in place of dollar, we can dream. Tech can be programmed to send sats by touch of each others devices p2p | person to person. 1 buck 1 sat just imagine. Same goes for any alt if it dominates im by no means a maximalist... just want to end corruption IMHO.
