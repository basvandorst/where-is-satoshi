Agreed, I guess I was speaking in terms of projecting past trends forward (sketchy business to begin with).

In other words: The prices of BTC has increased this year.
Anything that averages an upward trend will have dips followed by larger gains.
Also, the scale on that chart *really* obscures how varied the sizes of those moves have been.

Sure, but a log chart over that short a span of time with that amount of price movement is really iffy, since it really hides the fact that a 30% move at the beginning of 2017 was not even close to the same scope of event as the recent moves.

That's pretty common before crashes, though. You get a correction, then you get a wave of sales from those looking to get out at the local maximum, then buying, etc. It's why every crash wiggles on the way down, especially early on.
Definitely not saying this is going to happen, just saying that an initial correction back up absolutely does not rule out a major downward move.

I think you're missing his point here.
He's not saying it is headed to $10, he's saying that the wild fluctuations in the recent price are unlikely to be a result of honest investment in the future of the currency, but rather the result of speculation. Given that, your personal position on the future of BTC probably shouldn't be relevant for your decision making w.r.t. whether or not to sell your positions in the short term, since you could see a huge downturn (and consequently a big hit your personal wealth) as a consequence of factors that are truly unrelated to the long term success of the currency.
What he meant about being disconnected from reality and common sense was that treating the recent moves of the price as a function of the long term viability of the currency is probably not a good idea. Nothing to do with the "common sense" of the underlying technology.

Not what I mean. My point is that a 30% move at the beginning of the year when it's still quite niche, no one is talking about it except tech people and blockchain advocates, and the price is still within a range that could be considered to be based on some realistic projection of value is one thing. A 30% move now, when the price is based on nothing except speculation, is totally different. The log chart sort of obscures that to make it look as if everything that is happening right now is sort of "business as usual," but that couldn't be further from the truth.

Fair enough, agree to disagree. My argument would be that not that long ago the bulk of ownership was btc enthusiasts and blockchain believers. I think that balance has totally shifted to now be majority pure speculators whose investment is divorced from their long term views on crypto. If I'm right, then a shock to the system now could be devastating in a way that wasn't really true before.
