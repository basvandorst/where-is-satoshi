Actually large swathes of the developing world are now well served by mobile phones.

That's simply not true. I work for an online media company and the number of users we see watching videos in the developing world grows every year. This is particularly true in India and South East Asia.

Yes. Since the two chains would share a common history, any bitcoin you had on the main chain will be available on the SW2X chain as well. 
All you need is the private key which will be the same for both chains.

I would also caution you to stay away from mining unless you have a couple thousand dollars to invest in Asic miners. 
Go buy some Bitcoin on coinbase, move it to a secure wallet where you control the private keys, and enjoy the ride.

a Trezor was literally the first thing I purchased with Bitcoin. At first I was hesitant to drop the money but it provides me with huge peace of mind knowing my crypto is protected. I would recommend getting one or a ledger, particularly if you plan to add to your portfolio. Also keep in mind that what you already have might appreciate in value

If you're just planning to hold BTC, either Trezor is a good option I think. I have the original and it works perfectly. With that said, if you're holding other coins as well, you might consider the Ledger as it currently supports more coins.

Not really, I was just practicing.

I guess you've never used another cryptocurrency before?

If I ever have doubts, I tell myself, "It's better to regret something you did, than something you didn't do."

Electrum and Mycelium are popular choices but the most secure options would be a hardware wallet, like the Trezor or Ledger, or cold storage. Make sure to read up on wallet security.

This is sound advice. Dollar cost average is the way to go. Just pick a day and time and buy a weekly amount you can afford
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:05:42
Right, and the other advantage is you'll find you won't care so much about the daily ebb and flow of prices.

9 Trillion dollars missing from federal reserve and inspector general of the Fed has no idea why, or where it went after 8 months. Is super sketchy during questioning.

Mmmm yes, quite.
Tis most assuredly the finest display of gallantry and nuance these fair eyes hath seen on this fine day.

Leaving your crypto on an exchange or online wallet is not recommended. The most secure way to store your bitcoin is to either create a paper wallet, or get a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor.
There are also desktop wallets like electrum or exodus which are highly regarded. With that said, if it's on a computer, connected to the internet, it is hackable.
If you want to monitor your investment you need only Google "Bitcoin Block Explorer" and enter your public key to view the contents. You can also get an app called blockfolio on your smart phone which can track your investment.

This is patently untrue. Any exchange of crypto for any reason other than to fiat is considered a barter transaction and capital gains are taxed.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:01:41
My personal recommendation would be one of the hardware wallets provided you can afford it. If you're holding large sums, it's really the way to go.
