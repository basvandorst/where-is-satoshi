Just means it's a good time to buy!

Pardon my ignorance, but how does it equate "1 jacuzzi with a view" to $2.50?

This whole thing smells like a ponzi scheme to me.

Same here.  She didn't let me buy when it was $.50.  Now she just let's me buy as I please as long as bills are paid and necessities are met.

What does the 50% reinvestment go towards once this loan is paid off?  Do they then just buy the amount of hardware with the 50%?

Is there any service out there that you can have a miner connect to, that does this analysis for them, and redirects their connection to the best/safest pool?

Good question.  What would you prefer it to do?  Email each person that amount, split it across the recipients, or email back saying only email one person?

I used this a month ago.  Super simple and quick. Was about $30/btc over coinbase price.

I bought 3 at $800.  Still holding.  Now I buy $50-$200 worth a week to hold, or use immediately on gyft when groceries or amazon purchases are needed.

I bought the domain coinywhere.com  I plan on creating a square cash equivalent + hosted wallet for bitcoin, enabling anyone with a bitcoin address or a coinywhere account to email, text, tweet, etc.. someone bitcoin.

I see this is a month old now, but check out coinsetter. I believe you can short there.

Why not get on Amazon's cloud (AWS) using a load balancer (Elastic Load Balancer) and their CDN (cloud front)?  They have pricing calculators you can use to see how it will compare to your hosting you user now.

Paper wallet on thermal paper seems very dangerous to me.

Isn't saving it in the cloud a bad idea?  The PDFs will have the private keys on them and if the clouds gets hacked the hackers have access to them.  Isn't it better to print off, laminate, and store in safe deposit box or some sort of safe?

Some people are saying he threw away the pk's. Some say hackers stole it.  Any official word on which it was?

This is really, really cool!  I live around the Toledo area and have always wanted my pilot's license.   Unfortunately, I dont have any bitcoin or extra money, but I will remember this for when I do!  
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:30:51
Send some this way while you're at it! Please and thank you!
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:09:42
Makes sense.  Didn't think of it that way.  Thanks.
