It is worse than that, whales will often dump up to 100k bitcoins to force longs to liquidate at a loss. Then the whales will just buy them all back after bitcoin prices have sharply dropped due to all the forced sales.

Each time you make a payment on the LN, the earliest time for the transaction is decremented by one block. As long as the recepient turns in this transaction before you turn in one without the latest transaction history, he will receive his bitcoins.
This confused me at first, because I normally think of an address as being time locked, but it is actually a time locked (potential) transaction.
I do wonder about possible attacks based upon various ways delaying transactions though.

To be honest, I think it does, although kind of tricky to sign. However, whenever I try to push the transaction, the network claims that the date hasn't arrived yet. I think the problem with redeeming Bitcoin Gold HODL addresses is actually in the mining code. They are rejecting valid transactions.
You can grab your BTG at normal pre-fork addresses, but send them directly to an exchange address. Transactions from addresses after the fork date seem to go into the mem pool okay, but never get mined.

The Bitcoin Gold code is the same (except a line added to allow HODL txs from BTG).

I disagree. Most people think of Bitcoin as money or a store of value, but it is more. When you own a bitcoin, you are basically owning a piece of the network. When developers improve the network, where do you think all the value flows? It has to go somewhere. The network becomes more valuable.
Bitcoin is more than just a commodity or form of money. It is a combination of money, stock, and commodity.

There are people that choose to meet their needs in ways that are extremely harmful to others. I am not even referring to those people that just don't know about alternatives.
I am referring to people that know exactly how to meet their needs in a productive manner, but don't want to expend the labor. They are lazy.
Look at those videos made by Elliot Rodgers. He knew exactly what he needed to do to get a girlfriend, but he was unwilling to do the work. 
Look at Stephen Paddock. He had everything. Enough money saved to live like a king for the rest of his life. Owned a plane, traveled overseas and had all the hot Asian girls he wanted (I have been there, they love Americans and flock to you even when I was dirt poor). Yet he choose to kill all those people for fun rather than do the work to find some other way to enlighten his life. 
Even Charles Manson can be forgiven when you understand his childhood (go check out Stefan Molyneux's video on the guy), but Elliot and Stephen just preferred evil over doing any work on themselves.
And I realize that science does not include concepts like evil or bad. They (scientists) also don't believe in consciousness since it can't be measured, even though we each experience it. They just say it is an illusion or self-deception. For that matter, we can't even prove the universe exist, we might just be a Boltzmann brain in a vast chaos.

**Sweeping** actually moves the coins via a transaction to your wallet. **Importing** moves the private key/public address pair to your wallet. 
If you actually *swept*, then you just need your 12 seed words, if you *imported*, you will still need your old private key if you have coins remaining in it.

I wouldn't trust a Trezor to stop the government. They could peel away the plastic on the chips, tap the lines, and figure your 4/5 digit numeric passkey, then transfer your coins.
You could use Electrum and memorize your 12/24 word seed. Just make sure the password is really strong when you create the wallet or that there is absolutely no image of it left on your hard drive.
To be honest, I would use a [brainwallet]( for a situation like this.
A third option, would be to create a fake account on your Trezor with a small amount of Bitcoin.
If there is a possibility of torture/coercion, you need to use multi-signature wallets.

At one point if you imported a private key into Electrum wallet, then spent from that address, it would send the change to a change address. Of course, somebody at one point wanted to spend some money from a paper wallet, set up a temporary Electrum wallet, then deleted it and tossed the seed words after redeeming some coins. Later when they checked their paper wallet, they discovered all their coins were sitting at another address and they didn't have the private key to it.
Later Electrum fixed it so that change from an imported key would be sent back to that address (which I prefer). Of course, that just means that as some point somebody imported a private key (not swept it), kept the seed words, threw away their old paper wallet, deleted Electrum, got rid of the computer, then years later installed Electrum using the seed words....and no bitcoins.
Which just goes to show that no matter what you do as a programmer, somebody will always figure out how to mess it up.
Be safe, check your transactions, know where your coins reside, always have a private key recovery plan.

I believe the time you wait to retry after a password error double each time. There was a big article about that written by a guy that lost both his seed and key code number. Luckily he was able to recover it due to a bug in the code.
However, this has nothing to do with recovering your key code number.
Integrated circuits are encased in a plastic, but that plastic can be carefully removed with various chemicals. Then probes can be placed against the exposed circuits. You can record the impulses using a logic analyzer. You will be able to see the code being executed. At some point, the stored values will be loaded into the CPU for a comparison revealing them to you.

I would not consider that to be a blatant lie. It cost me $7 to send my wife $100 via Western Union. They also have a terrible exchange rate which adds another 1-3%, which adds up to 8-10%. If my wife has an emergency and needs an extra $10 for food, it still cost $5 to send via W.U., so now we are talking about a 50% fee.
With the Bitcoin-&gt;Bitpesa-&gt;Mpesa route, we are talking about pennies for the transaction and a much more favorable exchange rate. I have calculated the costs be less than 1% even for small sums of $10. It may not be free, but it is damn close to free.
Also not mentioned is the hassle of using Western Union on her end. There are very few W.U. offices and she often has to wait in line for 4-8 hours to get her money. With the Bitcoin-&gt;Bitpesa-&gt;Mpesa route, she can go to any of the thousands of Mpesa shops to get money in just a few minutes.

It appears to me that the address created is a hash of the public key and the time lock. Until an attempt is made to send the coins there is no way to know that it is a time locked address. Once you send from that address though, it will be obvious that it was time locked.

Absolutely, I could see the price actually dropping if to many people bought with the idea of selling after the next halving.
Supposedly, the market anticipates everything and puts it into its price. Only unknown factors should alter the price in the future. If a known factor does change the price suddenly when it happens, then we may have proof of lack of market logic. Either way, the results of BTC price should be interesting.
Altcoins, like Dogecoin, don't respond favorable to halving.

I always felt small local purchases was the worst case use for bitcoin anyway.
In Kenya, where Mpesa is wildly successful, people still use cash for small local purchases.
Bitcoin is best used as a store of value and sending value over the internet. Just think how much money a company like Walmart could save if they made all purchases using bitcoins. Imagine how much money, countries could save by selling oil for bitcoins. Imagine how much money, resources, and paperwork could be saved if offshore accounts were replaced with bitcoins.

My experience has been otherwise, especially when sending money to a foreign bank and/or using currency exchange. They take a percentage and even 1% of a million dollars is $10k.

Besides, watching the government try to ban math is so much fun. They should start by banning large prime numbers, since they can be used to create large composite numbers that allow you to create a public/private key pair.
We should probably outlaw the Fermat Primality Test too. People should not have easy ways to find prime numbers. It might be to tempting. 
We should also outlaw the teaching of Euler's Theorem since any smart kid can guess/derive the Fermat Primality Test from it. I did when I was about 15.

If you don't have a backup of the private key, then you will need to send the hard drive to a recovery specialist. They can remove the platter and insert it into another hard drive case.
BTW, losing the OS doesn't mean the HD is necessarily fried. It is quite possible that you can still access it as a secondary drive.

Excessive number of members (like 70%) seem to be kids. I suspect mom's take their kids in for testing multiple times till they pass. These kids weren't dumb, but they weren't geniuses either. They were just "clever".
Uneducated geniuses. People who have an ability to do logic or solve complex puzzles, but are uneducated in the basics of science or philosophy. Nothing worse than arguing with someone who seriously thinks that we used hologram emitters to hide missiles in a conspiracy to destroy the twin towers or that the moon landings were fake.
Lack of street smarts. Most have never traveled outside of the United States. Most seemed to be from the sequestered middle class and incredibly naive about the world outside of their social group.

I could make an algorithm that would take data and turn it into an illegal jpeg. For instance, in the "M=2 to power Y modular R" operation, M can step through every number that is less than R (as long as R is a prime number) as you increment Y. Since every file is represented by a number, then eventually M will represent an illegal picture. In fact, M will represent every illegal picture in existance that is smaller than R. Admittedly, finding Y for any particular picture would be a daunting challenge. Perception is truly in the eye of the beholder.

I worked as a field engineer for over 10 years installing &amp; repairing industrial equipment. This is a total failure for your company. Getting the shipment out on time may have been out of  your control, but when something like that happens, you go the extra mile to make it up to your customer. When the unit turned out to be defective, you should have replaced it immediately or if customs would create a problem with that, you send out your best field person, who can figure out how to get the parts needed to the location for the necessary repairs.
One last thing. If a customer buys something and then next week you put it on sale. If the customer notices the new sale price and complains about it, you retroactively give them the sale price.

I believe the ability to store, hide and move wealth across borders is going to be the ultimate app for Bitcoin.

Get on a matatu heading to downtown Nairobi between 5 and 6 AM in the morning. EVERYBODY has a smart phone or tablet out (except for me the poor mzungu). My wife is a sales rep there and has several phones (one gets calls for free, while the other makes calls for free). In the corner of her apartment is a small device that meters out her electricity. She can refill it using MPesa. We went out for a walk once and she wanted a coke. Neither of us had brought any money. She said "no problem", went into an MPesa exchange shop, did something with her phone, and they handed her a 500 shilling note. Unfortunately, there are no money changers that accept bitcoin in Nairobi (the one listed on coinmap.org is a scammer). If I need money, I have to sell some through Circle or Coinbase, then withdraw the funds from my bank account at a local ATM. Kipochi is broken for me (probably because I am an U.S. citizen).

Of course, nothing breaks the laws of physics. That still leaves a huge potential playing field though. For instance, if the multiple universe inpretation of physics is correct, we may at some future date create a computer that has an infinite virtual copies of itself. Each computer (eigenstate copy) tries a random number to perform a HSH256 or ECDSA operation. The virtual computer that wins this lottery, then drops itself out of it's eigenstate and becomes the original computer with the correct answer.
That being said, I am not very worried. Grover's algorithm is next to worthless for breaking encryption. It big claim to fame is factoring a four bit number. Wake me up when it starts factoring 256 bit composite numbers made up of a pair of 128 bit primes.

Your recourse is the merchants reputation. A good reputation takes time to develop. As a merchant, I don't want unhappy customers and will give up my profit if necessary to keep it. The only time I will ignore my reputation is to avoid being ripped off. Like if a customer bought something, then later a different person came in and claimed the money was stolen. And yes, that has happened before with a $500 computer purchase. If I had given the money back, I would have immediately gone out of business. The first six months when I opened my computer store, I was eating top ramen to survive.
It is much easier for a customer to choose their merchant than it is for a merchant to choose customers. For instance, when I tried to limit Ebay sales to those who had an account for at least one year, I got a lot of flack from Ebay. Ebay also as a general policy prevents merchants from posting negative reviews about customers. The only way is to vote a positive rating and write "scammer" in the comment field.
As a customer, you have a lot of information about a merchant. But as a merchant, you have very little information about a customer.

I have been in your situation before and it is the main reason I use a brainwallet to store most of my wealth. Memories are fallible, especially for that length of time, so I would suggest getting a tattoo with some type mneumonic reminder. If you don't trust brainwallets, use a deterministic wallet, memorize the words and also tattoo reminders of the words (not actual words) on your body. 
When you are in prison, keep your mouth shut about owning bitcoins, never tell anyone. Nobody should know what the tattoos on your body represent. Prepare a story, in case anyone asks about them.
The nlockedtime variable does not work. Forget it. Besides, that might just give someone a reason to keep you locked up till the time runs out. 
If you think you might be pressured into revealing the key, then prepare a story about where you hid your paper wallet up in the mountains. For instance, at the top of Rainbow Falls at the far end of lake chelan. They would have to fly you up there, go on a 3.5 mile hike uphill. If they ever go that far (which I would doubt), just say that the topography looks different.
If you want a more verifiable story, take a trip down to Mexico. Go to the beach and bury some pennies. Now if you are forced, you can tell them that you buried a piece of metal with the private key etched on it and that you put some pennies near the spot you buried it, to help you find it again with a metal detector. Now your story will check out with both customs and the fact that the pennies will be discovered. You could even bury a rusty piece of metal (preferably one you found on the beach) further under the pennies. Now you can just claim that the rust is obscuring the private key. 
If you feel that you still might be forced to divulge your wallet, make two of them. One for eventual discovery, the other for your release &amp; possible retirement.

I had my bank account illegally garnished once just after payday &amp; sending out checks. I got the money back after going to court, but the collateral damage was actually worse. The bank charged me over a thousand dollars for the resulting overdrafts. The people that had received the checks wanted bounced check fees. I was just barely making ends meet at that time, so I had to declare bankruptcy to get out of this mess.
I store the majority of my wealth in a brainwallet. Even if I went to prison for a dozen years, I will still have my money. A vault would be long gone by then.
Before Bitcoin, I stored most of my wealth in precious metals. Even though they were well hidden, I never felt safe about it. Now I sleep much better not worrying about my wealth. And yes, my passphrase is long &amp; unique. It has a lot of entropy. I even wrote my own brainwallet program to make sure there were no trojans in the code.
The only disadvantage to storing wealth as bitcoins is the price volatility. This can be mitigated by using cost averaging and buying over time. I have been buying bitcoins for about 18 months now and their value is about 3 times the money I have spent on them.

For me it serves as a super safe place to store wealth. I can travel across borders and take it with me. I could go to prison and lose everything, but I have memorized my private key to my main stash, so I would still have my BTC when I got out.

The value fluctuates a lot, but I have been buying steady for about 18 months using cost averaging and I am still ahead.

I sometime wonder if Bitcoin may just settle somewhere between $400 and $800. I am thinking that only a small percentage of the population have really good uses for it. For me, due to huge old debts and lawsuits (thanks to the USA government), I have a special love for brainwallets for storing my wealth. I guess for most people they don't mind inflation and keeping money in the bank. They don't travel internationally and have pensions and social security for their old age. I have always been an outlier from the general population, so it is hard for me to predict what the average person will do.

Apparently there is a list of common R values, so spending even once from a wallet could compromise it in this case.

Americans that have never traveled overseas do not have any idea how bad the USA has gotten. They still think of the USA as the land of the free.

If you are in the minority and still want freedom, your only choice is to flee the USA or basically hide within it.

There will always be wealth inequality, because some people will always spend everything they have. The  rule to getting rich is to save more than you spend. They violate this rule. 
I had a friend that inherited a $100,000 about a decade ago. He was unemployed at the time. I recommended starting a used car business, something that I am familiar with. Instead he spent it on partying, drugs, and girls. It was all gone in less than 3 years and he became homeless again.
My sister-in-law received $5000 once, she spent it so fast on junk that she was having trouble finding money to pay her rent the NEXT MONTH.
Due to my autism and a messed up arm, I am usually unemployed. When I do work, it is often at minimum wage. I earned less than $12k last year. Yet I have always tried to save at least 10-25% of my income when working. I am not working now, but my financial situation is still much better than most people I know.

Olaf, I would strongly suggest one of the following:
1) Have the algorithm decline the transaction at time of purchase. Don't wait 5-7 days to cancel. When bitcoin prices go up during this time, it makes people feel ripped off. It may be legal on your part, but it isn't moral.
2) Lower buy limits if you don't trust them. 
3) Hold the bitcoins in escrow until you feel that the transaction is not fraudulent. Even a 90 day hold would not piss people off as much as canceling a transaction.

I actually consider the tx limit to be a valid concern and I believe that at some point it will start changing the evolution of the Bitcoin ecosphere. I expect four major things to happen. First, a lot of transactions will take place off the blockchain. Changetip and Circle to Circle txs for example. This will result in the second thing, which is centralized Visa/Mastercard type places that run their own network using Bitcoin as the fundamental unit of value. The third thing is a bidding war for getting your transaction completed on the blockchain. I expect at some point, paying a $1 or more to complete a transaction. Eventually, moving bitcoins directly on the blockchain will be for governments, big business, rich people, and us hard-core bitcoiners with our own personal wallets. This will eventually result in the last and fourth stage. Altcoins with smaller tx fees. I can even see some fairly centralized altcoins with large businesses linking them to Bitcoins. For instance, Apple could start AppleCoins and run their own exchange. They could set a price target, buying when price drops to low or selling if the price starts to rise. 
In essence, I see Bitcoin becoming a major world reserve currency.

Which means my second batch of customers never got their bitcoins. Strange thing is none of those customers did a chargeback, which makes me wonder if paypal fights/denies chargebacks when there is no money in your paypal account.

I am American and have a Kenyan wife:  &amp;  I use Bitcoin (as you can see in the first picture) and she uses Mpesa.
 
Watching the advantages to her in using Mpesa is one of the reasons why I have high hope for Bitcoin. In the corner of her apartment is a meter for her electricity. She can refill it using her cell phone. She gets paid via Mpesa, she supports her parents via Mpesa so she doesn't have to see them.
We were out one night and she wanted a coke, discovered that neither of us had brought money, she said "wait a minute", ran into a small store, did something with her phone, the gal handed her a 500 shilling note, and we were good to go.
Mpesa isn't perfect though. It is often taxed, it is pegged to shillings which she complains rapidly lose value in Kenya.
To convert Bitcoin to shillings, I have to sell BTC through Circle or Coinbase, then use a local ATM machine to withdraw. There is a listed exchange in Nairobi on coinmap, but the owner there is a scammer (he tried to trick my wife into turning over her private keys).
It is my hope that Kipochi will eventually allow me to directly convert from BTC to Mpesa. Better yet, an honest money changer in Nairobi. I often use  to put airtime on my wife's phone though.

Before the Nov 2013 bubble, there was a lot of stable support just around the $120 point, so I would extrapolate $360 now, which is obviously wrong. My next extrapolation which is basically based on the Dec 2012 (I look for low volatility spots on the price chart) is just above $120. Taking the logarithmic average between those two ((120 * 360)^0.5) and we get around **$208**.

Yes, but unless Liberland has sufficient power to defend itself, then this is probably the end of it.
[Bir Tawil]( is unclaimed, but I am sure that if a bunch of libertarians/anarchists tried to settle it, we would see the Egyptian army appear shortly.
[Marie Byrd Land]( is unclaimed, but an international 1959 treaty allows America or Soviet Union to make a claim. Once again, it comes down to having sufficient firepower to defend oneself.
This pretty much leaves seasteading as the only way to start a country without potential conflict with another country.
One possibility for starting a new country might be select a small isolated strip of land in a small country with a limited military and simply take it over. Say a part of Somalia. I think this could succeed with sufficient planning and financial support.
I have been giving a lot of thought recently to the idea of creating a government that is not based on ownership of land. The main problem is that as soon as it tried to defend one of it's citizens, it would be declared a terrorist group.

I actually feel that all the arguing and contention is more damaging than raising the block size by 1 MB.
If I had my way, I would just double the block size every time we have a halving of the mining reward. So right now we would be at 2 MB and would go to 4 MB when when the mining reward drops to 12.5 BTC. 
Miners could still set a minimum fee to keep the blocks down to a reasonable size if they were having hardware issues.
Don't worry though, I am not a large miner, so my opinion has no weight in the marketplace of ideas.

Part of the problem is we are mixing the "private key" term up with the "secret exponent" term. The 0x01 is actually the secret exponent. You use the secret exponent to form the private and public key. You double hash the public key and add some formatting info to get the address. So we have an irreversible flow as follows:
Secret Exponent -&gt; Private Key and Public Key -&gt; Address
In the case of using 0x01, we get the following:
0x01 -&gt; 5_HpHagT65TZzG1PH3CSu63k8DbpvD8s5ip4nEB3kEsreAnchuDf -&gt; 1_EHNa6Q4Jz2uvNExL497mE43ikXhwF6kZm
Remove the underline after the 5 and the 1 (used to prevent censoring by autobot) of course. You can then check the address on the blockchain and see it has received over 4 bitcoins.

I have no particular concern about bitaddress and the random number generator is based on mouse movements, so that is relatively safe.
The biggest thing I look for is some variation of x=(x%q)+p; where x is the secret exponent, p is a very large number and q is a large number in a searchable space. This would allow someone to run a program that scans all bitcoin addresses generated from the secret exponent where p&lt;x&lt;q+p.
Bitaddress may put their code up on github, but are you sure that it is the same as used on their website? How about tomorrow? For instance, I made a copy of the Brainwallet.org website and carefully went over the code before using it. Also, I only use the version/copy that I downloaded.

Listening to it right now, he is mistaken about remittances. He quotes 5 pounds to send a hundred pounds (5%) and 17 pounds to send 500 pounds (3.4%) when he asked about sending money. What he is missing is the poor exchange rates of using something like Western Union. They grab a couple more % on that.
When I used Western Union to send money to my wife in Kenya, it cost $7 to send $100, plus about 2% margin on currency exchange, so about 9% total. With the bitcoin-&gt;bitpesa-&gt;mpesa route, the costs are about 1%. This remains true even if my wife needs an extra $10 or $20 in the middle of the month. Try sending $10 using Western Union, it still costs $5.
There is another area where Bitcoin really shines compared to Western Union and that is convenience. Going to a Western Union outlet in Nairobi at the beginning of the month can be an all day process. There is a shortage of them and even in the city you may have to take a matutu trip to find one. Going to an Mpesa outlet takes just a few minutes. They are everywhere.
There are a lot of people in the Bitcoin forums that believe Bitcoin will replace fiat currency. I don't believe that. Mpesa is everywhere and super simple to use in Kenya, yet people still prefer to use cash for small and quick transactions. If I am walking by a fruit vendor, it only takes a moment to pull out a 20 shilling coin, grab a slice of pineapple, hand over the 20 shilling coin, and continue walking.
It is in international commerce and remittances that Bitcoin really shines. Imagine how much money oil companies and large stores with world wide suppliers could save once they start using bitcoins for their payments.

With depreciating fiat currency, making loans for depreciating assets can still make sense (car loans), but with a currency that appreciates over time, you would only want to make loans for something that is expected to appreciate in value (businesses).
I suspect that in a Bitcoin economy, only people with the absolute highest credit worthiness would be able to get loans. Those people would also probably be less likely to want loans. People will have strong incentives to just earn and store bitcoins, not spend or loan them out.

I never claimed that a gun hasn't taken an innocent life. Also that graph is misleading because it includes states where criminals use guns (they go to a nearby state to buy them), but law abiding citizens aren't allowed to own or carry them for defense.
Also a lot of the "death by gun" graphs put out by liberals in the USA include suicides, which makes them meaningless.
In Oregon with it's lenient gun laws, you are still more likely to be killed by a cop than by a criminal using a gun.

How much consolidation would occur with say a doubling of the block sizes? How does SegWit prevent consolidation with their bigger blocks?
@_date: 2017-03-14 05:45:32
I think we are way past compromise. The discussion has devolved to Ad hominem and Straw Man attacks. Egos are involved at this point, preventing compromise. The only hope at this point is that Bitcoin will fork when BU (with Classic) reaches 51%. The BU/Classic fork will probably go to 2 MB blocks and the Core/SegWit side will be free to start doing their thing too.
After witnessing the progress of ETH/ETC fork, I think a Bitcoin fork is best for everyone.

Yes, there are land lines in Kenya, but they are rare. Even most businesses don't have a land line. As for internet lines, they are fairly common, but still only in areas that already have cell phone coverage. It doesn't cost much to throw up a cell tower compared to wiring a city for internet. In the outermost areas of Kenya, you will find internet cafes that basically run a USB cable to the top of a tall tree and plug in a G3/G4 modem. BTW, I have seen the same thing when traveling in the Philippines.
So basically your internet coverage footprint is the same as your cell phone coverage footprint. Why build land lines when you can just throw up a cell tower?

What? I was one of the first people to argue that the late 2013 bubble was caused by Gox continuously buying bitcoins without any real money. Whether M.K. did it himself or someone hacked his machine is irrelevant. 
Or are you claiming that BTC didn't drop by over 50% in the last year? It was over 800 two years ago.
And even if bitcoin goes up by 10x in the next two years, that is still somewhat imaginative. Obviously, the common market doesn't expect BTC to hit $4000, or more people would be buying now.

It is incredibly hard to find the "next big thing". I scour the internet all the time looking for new things and never heard of Bitcoin till late 2013. Luckily, I did realize it's true value immediately though and managed to find and buy a few at $100 before they jumped up to over $1000. I bought a few more at $1000 at the end of the year.
Over 3 years later and it hasn't made any difference in my life. Yea, I could buy a decent used car now, but a few years down the road and nothing in my life would really be any different. The fact is that Bitcoin would have to reach at least $25k each to make any long term changes to my life.
It has really made me realize something though. Getting rich is almost pure luck. Here I am, a programmer, a libertarian, strong background in cryptography, scour the internet a lot, and yet I still never even heard of Bitcoin till late 2013. 
That being said, I will start putting more money into alt coins this year. We will need at least one other cryptocurrency to handle the number of transactions required in the future. Maybe several. Unfortunately, I can't tell you which ones will succeed.
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:59:39
I am convinced the forks are a result of attacks, the more attacks on bitcoin, the more forks. It is a form of evolution. Different forks have different characteristics and increase diversity. This increase in diversity increases the odds of bitcoin (or a fork if you prefer) surviving. 
When the attacks end, the forking will stop. BTW, it makes no difference if the attacks come from within the community or outside of it. Forking is a survival mechanism. 
You can also see forking as a form of decentralization. Each fork can survive independently and makes it harder for TPTB to kill cryptocurrency.

I doubt it and heres why. I spend a lot of time in Kenya and they have something called Mpesa. It is incredibly easy to use. You can send it from phone to phone easily. There are little kiosks everywhere (like 3 per block) that you can convert to/from your phone to/from cash. It just takes a couple minutes, much better than using a bank in the USA. People can use it in stores too, kind of like a credit card in the USA. My youngest wife pays her electric bill with it (and makes fun of the old people that go to downtown Nairobi to pay in person). If her mom or sister needs some money, she just sends it to their number. It is incredibly ubiquitous. 10 times better than PayPal.
Despite all that, it is still easier to just pull out a few coins to buy a eighth of pineapple ($0.10) or a kilo of tomatoes ($0.50). Five seconds to hand over coins vs. a minute or two to get the vendors phone  send the shillings, then have her make sure she received them. Even for something very expensive like a watermelon ($2), I still prefer to just hand over a couple 100 shilling notes.
BTW, Bitcoin works very well with Mpesa. There are places you can send Bitcoin and have some Mpesa on your phone within an hour. Go to a kiosk and have actual cash in another few minutes. In the USA, it takes almost a week to sell Bitcoins on Coinbase before money arrives in your account. And that is if you are lucky enough to live in a state that Coinbase serves.

58 year old guy here. Just be happy you invested in alts instead of of margin trading. I managed to lose 3 bitcoins going long when the price was only $400. A single momentary dip wiped them out. I did make a slight profit on alt-coins later, much safer since a momentary dip won't wipe you out.
Now that being said, take a look at the history of Litecoin. In late 2013, it went up to about $50, then later dropped all the way back to a $1. I actually bought a bunch there, sold them at $5 (ok...you can laugh now...since they went back up to $50 or so... but at least I didn't lose any money on them either!). So while alt-coins are a lot easier than margin trading, you can still lose a lot, as you already know.
Oh, btw, to all you people who own Ethereum, expect it to drop below $10 at some point. So sell them now, start buying back as it slides below $10. Enough digression.
Now back to your alts, **just sell them all** (*btw, that is just my opinion, you should never take my advice, and all the other legal mumble jumble, blah blah blah*). The exception might be one that you truly believe in, as in you would hold it for 10 years even if you never got ahead on it. You believe in it that much. Even there though, limit your exposure to about 10%. Consider it your hobby coin. I have a hobby alt-coin and I know that particular market inside and out. If you have a hobby coin, you should be doing the same. So 90% Bitcoin and 10% hobby coin.
Another thing, anyone who is going to do a lot of trading in the crypto sphere needs to understand Chaos Theory. You can start with "Chaos" by James Gleick. After reading that, keep staring at the charts till you start to see the fractal patterns underneath the effects of the whales.
Whatever you do, good luck.

So after 10 years of fixed mining rate, there will have about 150 billion dogecoins, resulting in an inflation rate of around 3.3%. In order for inflation to drop to 1%, there will need to be a total of 520 billion dogecoins and that will take about 80 years.

^ I was just making fun of this guy ^
While matter may just be trapped energy, most people perceive them differently. If I combine one gram of matter with one gram of anti-matter to get 2 grams of energy, then most people would say that I converted a total mass of 2 grams of matter into 2 grams of energy. Just like most people consider ice, water, steam to be 3 different things despite all being made of H2O.
As for proving that energy can be trapped as information (just like energy can be trapped as matter), just build a Maxwell's Demon Box and weigh it before and after it reduces the amount of entropy inside of it :)
Once you understand that energy can be used to create information and that information can be used to create energy (or at least reduce entropy), then you should be able to understand that Bitcoin Mining turns energy into heat AND INFORMATION, not just heat. So a microscopic amount of energy is trapped as information. Personally, I believe that amount of energy trapped as information would be equivalent to more energy than is found in the TOTAL MASS OF A NEUTRINO.
Now I realize that there are some inefficiencies in all of this. A lot of energy is converted to heat. But remember, OP never mentioned all the energy that is saved by not having to print fiat currency, have employees drive to banks, move paper around, heat bank buildings, run the AHC system, run a military complex to support our petrodollar system, build off shore industries to protect against taxes, ect. He just directly jumped to 


So if OP can simplify the mining process to (Bitcoin Mining-&gt;Heat-&gt;Global Warming), then I can certainly simplify to (Bitcoin Mining-&gt;Traps Information-&gt;Reduces Global Warming). Basically, I was making fun of OP's flawed logic by proposing a preposterous counter claim.
Unfortunately, you were to ignorant to perceive any of this.

Dogecoin has two major problems:
* Built in inflation of around 5% per year to keep it's value perpetually low and the coin from being used as an increasing store of value. Dogecoin was started as a joke coin and the developers mean to keep it that way.
* No support for the Electrum wallet. They did have it for a short time, but abandoned it. Do you know how some people (in the USA) don't consider a town to be a city until it gets a McDonalds restaurant? I am one of those people.

It has nothing to do with research. It has to do with directed browsing and failing to hear about Bitcoin. Once I hear about something, I am very good about researching it.
Bitcoin was mentioned in the Wired in 2011:  and while the site was on my general reading list, I considered Wired articles to be mainly for entertainment purposes and never made any effort to catch up on missed issues or articles.
Anyway, I guess if you heard about Bitcoin years before I did and researched it, then you must be a millionaire. So go ahead and gloat.

Google has some kind of 2FA too, but I think it requires some special type of Google phone. It says to download an app, but apps don't seem to run on my computer. I can't afford a Google phone, so maybe I need a phone app emulator, not sure. The whole 2FA google app thing is confusing which is a recipe for disaster.

Back in 2013, A co-worker of mine died suddenly at age 60 of a heart attack (he looked healthy, but smoked and drank a 6 pack every night). He had around 100 bitcoins using blockchain dot info as his wallet. Anyway, at his funeral, I mentioned that they needed to save his computer because he had a bunch of bitcoins stored on it. The next time I saw them, about six months, I asked them if they were able to recover those bitcoins. They just stared at me as in "what are those?". I asked what they did with his computer and they had sent it to a recycle center that I knew destroyed hard drives. So I just let it go.
Fast forward to 2017...and I ran across a family member downtown. He starts asking "Didn't my brother have a bunch of bitcoins?". I told him "yep, about 100". He looked really upset when I explained there was no way to recover them.

While I understand your point of view and consider it valid, I was part of that history. We didn't really have hard drives or bandwidth to deal with, just memory space. And since it is impossible to have a 1000 address space, only a 1024 address space (2^10), EVERBODY just referred to it as 1K. We used tape drives for hard storage of data, hard drives (for consumers) came years later.
Hard drives use up space for formatting and skipping bad sectors, so looking at the actual size after formatting is more accurate anyway.
Back in those days, only techies played with home computers, so the jargon stuck. We were already misfits in society and if you started saying that you had upgraded your Elf II to a whole 1024 bytes of RAM, instead of saying that you upgraded to a whole kilobyte, you would have been laughed at by fellow your computer users.
Besides, 64k is forever burned as actually 65536 in my head.
Even today, I would ask for a 4 GB RAM chip, not a 4,294,967,296 byte RAM chip.
It does bug me that there only 12 ounces in a pound when weighing gold (as opposed to 16 for everything else) or that a sea (nautical) mile is different than a surface mile, so I guess I can understand that a lot of people dislike the old 1k = 1024 convention when talking about RAM chips.

I apologize for using UNICODE characters, however there was no intent to mislead anyone on that point. First, the wikipedia article is misleading. The symbols I used are part of the ASCII set that most people learn as programmers, see this link:  . It is also shown in an ASCII chart in my C programmers guide. If you google "ASCII character set", then click on images, you will see those characters listed in a lot of ASCII charts.
The following test program will even print those symbols on a PC:

    int main()
    {
        printf("ASCII test: %c %c %c
",3,11,12);return 0;

The confusion occurred because I was unaware that the { ♥ ♂ ♀ } symbols were converted to UNICODE in a web browser.

Your answer makes the most sense to me. Looking at slide 19, it talks about the level of computation needed to secure the network. I don't see this as a social cost, since the miners are the ones dealing with the cost/benefits of running their machines. 
I guess he might be referring to power needed to run the Bitcoin network, but I doubt the power requirements will ever exceed banking costs or gold mining costs. So that doesn't make sense either.
I see the social costs of Bitcoin as being much less than fiat currency, but I guess if he thinks loss of central control is a bad thing, that would explain his thinking.

I am curious about the logic in skipping 3G for 4G. The reason I ask is that when I am in Kenya, I use 3G. I noticed that 3G goes from 4MBytes/sec down to about 20Kbytes/sec if I download more than about 50GB of data during the month. I see places that advertise 4G, but 4G cost twice as much ($20/week vs. $10 week). 
According to Safaricom, 4G runs at 100 Mbps (12.5 MB/sec), yet bloggers at  claimed to get 21.75 Mbps and 17.78 Mbps (2.72 MB/sec &amp; 2.22 MB/sec). This doesn't seem any faster than 3G to me, although I realize that geography can really change individual results.

I am not sure we really disagree.  UK lacks the plethora of religious zealots. Without them to back up a government ban on gambling, you get legalization and a different strategy (like taxing it).
Ever wonder why prostitution is legal in Nevada, but not Reno or Las Vegas? The casinos don't want the competition, so they actively support a city ban on it.
If you want to know why most people in power do what they do, look at money. Where does it come from, where does it go, who supports it, ect. Money explains everything in the corridors of power.

I live in an area with about 50,000 people that has a single road to the main city. The road is about 10 miles long and can take 1-2 hours to drive each way. It would actually be faster to walk some days. The road is so congested, that I refuse to work a regular job. Instead I gave up my car and hitchhike into town when traffic isn't so bad. I panhandle till the evening after traffic starts to die down, then take the 7 pm bus home. It still takes an hour. The bus stops 2.5 miles from my home, so I still have to walk part way. There is also a 5 am bus that heads into town, but it doesn't show up half the time.
Imagine trying to use the bus to get to do a regular job: Get up at 3 am, get dressed, fixed breakfast, leave at 3:30 am, walk 2.5 miles, catch bus at 5 am, get to work at 7:30, start at 8 am, get off at 5 pm, catch bus home at 7 pm, get off bus at 8 pm, walk home 2.5 miles, get home at 9 pm, if you are lucky be in bed at 10 pm, sleep 5.5 hours and start over. 
That is not living, that is slavery. So when people scream at me "get a job!", I just laugh. If they want me to work a regular job, then they need to expand the roads, not try to force everyone to use public transportation.

I love how redditers will call anybody who makes an error a liar, rather than just correcting him.
It is obvious that henweight is talking about the $1200 price that occurred in Nov 2013.
Some people (for instance INTPs) tend to think in concepts while brushing over the facts. So in their mind "price went all the way up to 1200 and has been slowly dropping ever since". To them whether the slide happened over 22 months, two years, or even 30 months is really irrelevant.
Does the divergence between 22 months vs. 30 months (which I agree is a big error even for an INTP) make any difference in plans for dealing with Bitcoin?

I can't even imagine what society will look like a 100 years from now.
One last thought, why aren't there any ancient alien civilizations? Maybe at some point every intelligent species develops cryptocurrency, which fragments the social structure so badly that it never recovers. Or maybe crypto causes society to get caught in an endless loop like the Moties in "The Mote in God's Eye". As in crypto fragments society, which fragments the internet, which allows society to grow again, which allows crypto to flourish again, which starts the cycle all over.
I hope I survive long enough to see the result of a crypto society. It should be interesting.

This is where I can actually empathize with M.K. a bit. As a programmer, I am probably in the top 1% skill. For example, I wrote this program in just a few days to learn MFC (I already knew Assembly &amp; C):  
The problem I have is that I got in trouble several decades ago for a religious crime. I have never gotten a programming job since, even though I never committed a financial crime before prison. I won't talk about how I survive, but it would certainly cost society a LOT less if they just sent me a check for $1k every month.
And this is where the cost of being disenfranchised comes into play. M.K. basically has to survive in a foreign country using his wits. Imagine how much better the world would be if he could have just gotten some low-level programming job back in France.

I was walking down the street near Portland, OR when I realized that a huge amount of houses were empty with sale signs. So I started counting...final result in several hours of walking...over 20% of the homes are unoccupied and for sale.
The banks repo the house, but don't want to sell at a loss. If they do, they take a hit on the bottom line. So they just hold on to the asset and get it's value. This is holding prices up too.
I was talking about changes in society with a group of fairly smart people. One subject that came up was the amount of young people that don't want to ever own a home. Rent, stay with friends or parents, but don't tie yourself down with an illiquid asset. People who made tons of money in housing were early homeowners that raised families, then moved on. Eventually, real estate started to being viewed as an investment rather than a place to live. This has pushed prices way up and now a lot of people are starting to look at alternatives.
I know a few young people that buy/store Bitcoin at Coinbase. They have no interest in owning a house and being stuck to one geographic location.

Yes, I have spent time in seedy districts around the world. I read the article, question their methodology and found the conclusion (section 7) on page 25 to be tentative. They even said themselves that it needed more research.
But for sake of argument, let's assume they are correct and also that every trafficked victim has a pimp. The % of prostitutes with pimps could still drop. For instance if a country had a 1000 illegal prostitutes (100% needing pimps), then legalized prostitution. Those original 1000 now don't need pimps. Even if traffickers imported another 1000 (and have pimps), we would see a drop from 100% of prostitutes with pimps to only 50% of prostitutes with pimps. So it is still possible for trafficking to increase, while the % with pimps would still drop.

A safer way is to sweep funds from a brainwallet is to recreate the private key using an OFFLINE brainwallet, then import that key into Electrum. [This BRAINWALLET is written in javascript and will work OFFLINE](
Once imported into Electrum, you can send the funds to another address within Electrum if you want to empty your brainwallet. Just make sure you memorized your 12 word seed first.
Another nice thing about using Electrum (version 1.9.8 at least, I haven't checked other versions and I would not trust them without checking first) is that you can spend from an imported key and it will send the change back to the same address.

Yes, I use to sell around $5000 worth of bitcoins per month on Ebay at spot + 20% (leaving a 7% - $350 profit margin, more than enough for me to survive on). Used a 5-7 day waiting period, plus had a trick to identify people using stolen CC/Paypal accounts. 
I have been selling stuff on Ebay since 2003 with less than 1% negative feedback. A few months ago, they suspended my account. When I asked why, they claimed below average performance. They also wrote not to contact them again, they would not reconsider. I only had one negative feedback and I immediately refunded their money after refusing to send their btc. Turned out it was a stolen CC card (then attached to PayPal) from some really old lady too.
You have to understand that Bitcoin is a threat to both Paypal (alternative payment method) and Ebay (think OpenBazaar). Censoring anyone who has ANYTHING to do with Bitcoin is part of their strategy. The idea is reduce our income as much as possible to keep Bitcoin from growing.

I apologize for using UNICODE characters, however there was no intent to mislead anyone on that point. First, the wikipedia article is misleading.

I just spent half a year in Kenya and I have to say that M-pesa is everywhere. There are a dozen exchanges per block in the downtown area. 
M-pesa is widely used to send money, pay bills, ect. You go into a store and they have a vendor  there is an option on your phone to send shillings, you use your phone to send shillings to that vendor  You can also send it to another phone if you know their phone number. My wife doesn't like to visit her mom, but she does honor her obligation to support her. She just sends her mother money using M-pesa and so can avoid her that way. I realize that we can do that in the USA using Paypal, but you need a bank account to do that. Most people in Kenya cannot afford a bank account due to high monthly fees there.
I stayed at a small hotel near Mombasa for a couple nights that I had prepayed using a CC. When I went to check out, they told me that they had lost their CC account. I checked my account, saw that they didn't get paid. I didn't have enough cash with me. I asked for the phone # associated with their M-pesa account, then sent equivalent BTC to Bitpesa, which was then converted and sent to their M-pesa account. Problem solved..thank you Bitcoin/Bitpesa/M-pesa for working together so well.
If you have spent your whole life living in the USA, you probably think of Africa as some completely backward country. And in rural areas without power, they still are. But go to the city and they are actually leapfrogging us. Even their internet is faster. My 3G network in Nairobi was running at around 3MB/sec.

Because a private key uses a trap door function to make a public key, then a hash function (also one-way) is used to get the addresss. 
You can just create an address out of thin air, as long as it meets the proper format. For instance, starting digit and the last 6 digits for the checksum. Now you have an address that is treated as valid, even though there is no possible way (in our universe) to find the private key (or even public key for that matter).

You are right, I put zero in as the secret exponent, but it returned the address for the Hash256(""); instead. Private key of 1 is okay though. I guess zero is really the same as infinity on elliptic curves.

I sometimes need funds from a brainwallet, so I import the private key into electrum. When you spend from an imported key using electrum, it sends the change back to the same address. The same would work for your paper wallet. 
If you occasionally need to use funds in your paper wallet, then split it up into several. A large one for retirement and smaller ones for emergencies.

My first bitcoin was obtained selling a computer (customer wanted to pay with bitcoin and I had been reading about it for last couple days and wanted some). He called his wife, she created a private key, sent funds to that address, then sent me a .jpg of the private key (not safe to send text of private key). Eventually, I created a wallet, then swept the funds to it.
Point being that I was sent btc before I even had a wallet or knew how to make one. Can you do the same with the attachment?
I can already take a wallet.dat file, encrypt it, attach it to an email and send it. The final recepient can then load that file, then send the BTC to any address. Obviously, the password should be sent separately.
There is a way to send bitcoins over the phone. Create a new wallet, send btc to that wallet, now tell the person on the other end of the phone, the 12 word seed to the wallet. You could even send 4 words each through 3 separate channels, 4 by phone, 4 by email, 4 via skype. Obviously, the recepient should forward the funds, since this is only temporarily secure.
Edit: I guess you could just send an encrypted private key. The advantage of an encrypted wallet.dat file is that it shows that you probably have control of the original keys.

One of my co-workers died back in 2013 about 6 months after I left. We had talked about bitcoin previously and he was buying up to $1000 every month.
Anyway, I saw his family at the funeral and told them about the BTC and to be sure to check his computer and save them. I told them that they were worth several thousand at least, if not more.
I saw the family again about a year later and asked about his bitcoins. They didn't even understand the question. I asked about his computer. They told me that it was old and had been sent to a local recycle center. I know they destroyed all of the older hard drives there. Even the new ones that are kept get a full wipe.
I didn't ask any further questions and decided the best thing was to leave them clueless. They have no idea that they threw away several hundred BTC.

Seriously, these people should move to the Big Island of Hawaii. There is already a huge population of Libertarians and Anarchists down in the Puna area. While Hawaii may score as a socialist state, we (smaller government people) seem to be left alone out here. In my neighborhood, over half the homes are on temporary power poles, mostly for over a decade. Most people get a temp pole and just build a home following common sense. Yes, it isn't code, but nobody cares. People openly smoke pot, a local neighbor runs a weekly rooster-fighting tournament, cops told my brother to keep his gun collection hidden (they are illegal) rather than arresting him. This island is incredibly relaxed. It may not be perfect from a "laws on the books" standpoint, but the attitude of the people is what makes it such a free place to live.

There was an experiment done several decades ago by a multi-millionaire where he gave 100 people $100,000 each, equivalent to about a $1M today. 84 Spent all the money within a couple years, 12 of them put most of the money in the bank where it slowly lost value to inflation, only 4 actually started a business with it. 2 of the 84 did buy a house at least before they spent it all.
I have a friend that inherited $120,000. I suggested to him that we start a used car business together (we lived in a good location for that) Instead he quit his day job,  spent all the money on drugs and girls, then went homeless. He is now doing 5 years in prison for punching a cop while drunk. That money did him more harm than good.

Either way has advantages in knowledge gained.
For instance, if we stick to a 1 MB block limit, then we will see how much price pressure on fees will reduce smaller transactions.
If we do expand to a 2 MB block limit, then we will learn how increasing the block limit affects decentralization and creates mining difficulties. In the future if we will have real data to examine if we start discussing an even larger block limit.

I guess science is nutty then:
From 
The natural abundance hydrogen-isotope composition of leaf water (  δH2ODδDH2O ) and leaf organic matter (δ D org ) was measured in leaves of C3 and C4 dicotyledons and monocotyledons. The   δH2ODδDH2O  value of leaf water showed a marked diurnal variation, greatest enrichment being observed about midday. However, this variation was greater in the more slowly transpiring C4 plants than in C3 plants under comparable environmental conditions. A model based on analogies with a constant feed pan of evaporating water was developed and the difference between C3 and C4 plants expressed in terms of either differences in kinetic enrichment or different leaf morphology. Microclimatic and morphological features of the leaves which may be associated with this factor are discussed. There was no daily excursion in the δ D org value in leaves of either C3 or C4 plants. When δ D org values were referenced to the mean   δH2ODδDH2O  values during the period of active photosynthesis, the discrimination against deuterium during photosynthetic metabolism (ΔD) was greater in C3 plants (-117 to -121‰) than in C4 plants (-86 to -109‰).

I was in a bad situation once. Bought a one way plane ticket to the Big Island of Hawaii. Go to the west side of the island to Kona. You can easily find jobs around there. This is a rich retirement community without enough workers due to high rents (about $1500/month). You can also get about $360 per month in food stamps while looking for work.
At night sleep on the beach behind the old airport. It rarely rains around Kona. I bought a small tent and kept it in a black bag. You can easily hide it during the day. Make sure you clean up your area or the other people that live on that beach will beat you up at night. Oh, and be up as soon as the sun rises (around 6 am). There are other beaches that homeless drug addicts live on, you can tell from all the garbage. The people that live on that particular beach are generally drug free (except hemp, which is basically free in Hawaii) and try to keep that area that way, which is why they will beat you up in the middle of the night while you are sleeping if you leave a mess or they think you are a drug addict.

Bitcoin (and cryptocurrency) has plentiful uses: Tax havens (a multi-trillion dollar industry), protection from hyperinflation (check out Venezuela), banking for the politically incorrect (Snowden), easy way to pass wealth without inheritance tax, ease of world wide travel (brainwallets) and emigration. And while the underworld has moved to Zcash/Monero/Dash, Bitcoin is still used as an off/on ramp to it.
I use Bitcoin to send money to my youngest wife in Kenya via the Bitcoin-&gt;Bitpesa-&gt;Mpesa route. She gets about 13% more than if I sent money to her through the Western Union route.
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:46:20
According to Google, there is  $21 trillion to $32 trillion hidden in tax havens worldwide. This is why I wouldn't be too surprised to see a million dollar bitcoin within a couple decades.

And besides, they can print a trillion dollars a year. They could even start their own blockchain and back it with trillions or even quadrillions of dollars. Sure it would cause major inflation, but as an exit scheme, they would retain power for a few more generations.

There isn't really any need for replay protection. Just send some free dust to an address on one chain, then mix it in the transaction that moves those coins. That tx won't be valid on the other chain.
The real problem with replay protection is that it basically disables coins stored P2SH addresses. While you can export/import private keys to an alternative wallet, you can't do that with scripts.
For instance, a prefork script that is already signed to redeem bitcoins will not work to redeem bitcoin c a s h due to replay protection.

Their instincts will be to try and make a controllable cryptocurrency. Sending limits, KYA, AML, expandable supply, stuff like that. Even withholding private keys. Even Do ge co in will be better. As soon as they go more like a real crypto, they make it super easy to send your fi at co in s to an exchange for bitcoins.
The more they try to adapt, the more they will start to lose.
The most obvious solution would be for them to heavily invest in Bitcoin.
There is one other solution, but they won't have the political will to do it. Start an honest altcoin with backing by every government in the world. No premine, no  AML, no KYA. Even if one person high in government was smart enough to suggest this, it would make the BTC/B C C civil war look like a kids playground squabble.

He says the value of all bitcoins is about $3 billion. The real value is closer to $100 billion. **He is obviously mathematically illiterate**.
Power is measured in energy/time, but he describes the usage in energy used without reference to time, making his figures meaningless. **He obviously never took a physics class**.


He says hashing has only one nefarious purpose, to confuse and hide the true benefits of the hashing solutions. He is wrong so many times here, I don't even think I can count them all, but let's try:
* Hashing is actually done to secure the network
* The math is not a mystery, it is an open algorithm and can even be hard coded into chips.
* The true benefit (securing the network) is fully understood
* The hashing solutions have value (currently 12.5 bitcoins)
He then goes on to suggest using a centralized server to create tokens backed by actual money. This has actually been tried on multiple occasions in the past. The result is being closed down by the U.S. government and all tokens becoming worthless. **He obviously never studied Economic History**.
@_date: 2017-10-28 18:56:32
You are correct in that terawatt-hours is energy, but he writes it up in such a way that most people would confuse this with power being consumed. I can guess that he means 17 TWHR per year, but it should be written as the network uses 1.94 gigawatts of power (which is probably wrong too).
I say my computer uses 150 watts of power, not that it uses 1314 Kilowatt hours of energy(and let you guesstimate that I mean per year). I could also say that my computer uses .15 Kilowatt hours of power per hour, but that would just be silly.

They have a bad habit of cancelling transactions in a rising market, while basically claiming that "algorithms made us do it..".  I  believe this behavior is their  profit source.
If you make enough online noise, they will eventually honor the original deal and even white list you. But that still leaves a lot of unhappy customers.
They could fix the problem of questionable buys by offering to hold the purchased bitcoins in escrow for 90 days or however long they need to verify an honest transaction, but they refuse to implement this option.

Imagine if Bitcoin has reached it's final peak and volatility has dropped to almost nothing. We will still have economic growth though. So if production goes up 5% per year, then your bitcoins should buy 5% more stuff every year. 
We will still get investments in new stuff (for instance you have an idea that you think will get you 10% return per year), but you won't feel you have to invest just to stay ahead of inflation or keep up with rising productivity. 
This (a store of wealth that keeps up with world productivity gains) alone will be an incredible bitcoin application.

As much as I love Bitcoin and have personal uses for it, I think we are in a tiny minority. Most people love fiat currency and inflation.

Imagine if only 10% of bitcoins were for sale and the rest being HODLed no matter what. Then it would take less than $2.1 trillion to move it to a $21 trillion market cap ($1 million bitcoin).

Picking an arbitrary window like 1.5 years is a dumb way to measure wealth. For wealth management I consider a five year window to be more reasonable. Besides, I started buying about 2 years ago and have continued since then. I have lost a bit, about the same as if I was still holding gold.


In a SHTF scenario that results in no power, then fiat will be worthless too. I will still be okay. Even if the whole island was cut off from civilization, there is enough food grown locally to survive. And that doesn't include the strawberry guavas and wild avacados that grow like weeds around here. It would be impossible to starve.
Besides we occasionally get hurricanes and often lose power. Usually only for a week or two, but sometimes for months. We always do okay. We keep several months worth of non-perishable food around. I think there is still a hundred kilos of vacuum sealed rice around. And I could probably still find a few silver coins if I cleaned out my office. Besides, end of the world scenarios are overrated. My biggest worry would be figuring out how to get to the other side of the planet to see my wife.

In Kenya, they have this thing called Mpesa, it is super easy to use, works on even cheap cell phones. Much more advance than Visa/MC, paper checks, or PayPal. Free transfer cost for a lot of things. People use it at supermarkets, taxis, pay rent, pay electricity, ect. But if I buy a slice of pineapple for 10 shillings ($0.10) it is easier to hand over a coin, then stop for 45 seconds to type in an address, then type in an amount, then type in the password. 
Another example: When I take a matatu (bus), you can pay with Mpesa, but with a hundred people paying at once and all the confusion, it is easier to just hand over a couple coins.
I have a bunch of wooden tokens that are good for a free ice cream at a local restaurant.  They aren't issued anymore, probably havent been issued in over ten years. Yet people are still using them for barter. If you take one to that restaurant, they will still give you an ice cream for it.
There is no reason a government could not issue a responsible fiat currency. Say a batch of a million dollars in coins. Even go back to using silver to give them some intrinsic value. I certainly wouldn't have any problem using them for small purchases.
TL;DR Basically, I think fiat will have an utility use for small stuff. Just don't store your wealth in them.

To do for every citizen at $1000 per month * 12 months * 320 million people would be 3.84 trillion dollars. Same amount for everyone (just have to be U.S. citizen) since the idea is to eliminate all means testing.
This may seem a bit high, but we would be doing away with all pensions, S.S., disability, food stamps, welfare, ect. plus most of the administrative costs.
We could also do away with the minimum wage, since everyone is guaranteed enough money. This would help the economy and increase tax revenue.

* I find using Bitrefill to be an easy and quick way to buy airtime anywhere in the world.
* I sold all my gold &amp; silver, moved that wealth to Bitcoin. Now that wealth is intangible, nobody can take it from me (at least not without serious torture and then I am probably going to die anyway) and it is with me wherever I go. I just sleep better knowing that.

You know that is a definite possibility. About a year ago, there was a bad dogecoin website (I deleted the URL and forget it). Anyway, I did a small test transaction and it mixed up the outputs.

Judge Judy goes by emotion/feelings, body language, and surface evidence. She doesn't use logic or reasoning in her decisions. She never even let the plaintiff present his side of the case (except for a response to a question). I noticed he had some paperwork in front of him that she never looked at.
There were two important questions that were never asked or answered: Was there anything from Ebay showing that he sold some bitcoins &amp; if so what was the btc address that the bitcoins were sold too? After that, is there a transaction showing that he sent the bitcoins to a buyer?
I use to sell bitcoins online and I always kept proof of those two things in case I was ever accused of fraud.

You can contest it after the fact. This happened to me back in 1986 and the courts ordered my money returned, which it was. However, I still ended up with close to a thousand in overdrafts. I had to declare bankruptcy shortly thereafter. 
Most of my friends and family have had their bank account garnished at least once. Since minimum wage per hour * 30 is exempt in most states, I can file paperwork for them and help them get their money back. I had to follow up with a Writ of Mandamus once though to get an actual check.
This is one reason that I feel that more people should be using Bitcoin to store wealth. Most people can't afford to hire an attorney to get their money back after it is garnished from a bank. As for volatility, price averaging over a long period will fix that.

It didn't start out that way, and anybody could have bought \(or even mined\) bitcoins in the early days. It is only the increase in savings that has created an uneven distribution of wealth. The point everybody has had a fairly even chance to accumulate bitcoins over the years. There were even faucets that gave out a whole bitcoin for those who couldn't afford to buy any or figure out how to mine them.
Compare this to fiat currency that is only given out to those in power or with connections. Cryptocurrency is much more fair.

Sounds like the inputs you have for that address may not match those on the blockchain.

First mistake is paying rent/mortgage, for instance this very nice  home only cost $380,000 and comes with pool: 
So even if you pay taxes when you cash out, that still leaves you $470k ($850k-$380k) to retire on. Using your math of 8% interest and 20% taxes on it, that still leaves you with over $2500 per month to live on.

For guys that treat these encounters as one night stands, it probably doesn't. However, I tend to be a bit of a romantic, so I usually stayed with the same girl for the whole trip. I was practicing mini-relationships. I may love sex, but I was always hoping to get married.
I also believe that everyone, regardless of race or background, has the "divine light" within them. If you are familiar with christianity, think of it as everyone is made in the image of God. Because of this, I really try to make sure that when I leave, the girl is always in better condition than when I first met her. This doesn't just mean giving her a bunch of money, but really examining her life and seeing where something can really make a useful impact.
These are things that guys like me (computer nerd) never get to learn in the USA. We may get ignored in college, but eventually, our skills &amp; talents make us rich. But money isn't everything, we still need to learn relationship skills. That is where traveling overseas helps out. And I don't mean hiding out in some 5 star hotel, but living in the slums with the natives.
I know there are some bad people that engage in sex tourism (there is a particular website where guys even brag about taking advantage of foreigners, their callousness is nauseating). My Kenyan wife lived with two of them before meeting me. She said they always complained and treated her badly. She expected the same behavior from me, so was pleasantly surprised to find I was the opposite.

I agree that it would be terrible for people currently holding long term bonds since their value would sharply decline, although they would still get the final maturity price if they continued to hold them.

Yes, using loops of chain. 2 out 3 is pretty simple, you would need 3 padlocks loops on one side, and 3 fixed loops on the other side. This would allow a fixed loop to go through each possible combination of 2 loops. 
For 3 of 5, you would need 5 padlocked loops and 20 fixed loops though.
I think as a general solution this will be x padlocked loops and Y!/X! of fixed loops. Someone please correct me if I am wrong.

That violates 3 major tenets of TRP philosophy (her age, having a kid, quadruple digit # of sex partners). Worst yet, since my wife has trouble waking up, I make her breakfast and tea...which means....omg...I am so beta. 
There is nothing wrong with knowledge (including TRP knowledge), it is what you do with that knowledge that counts. Do you use it to take advantage of someone or do you use it to create a better relationship. I choose to use it to improve my marriage.
You obviously do not fully understand TRP philosophy.

The *degeneracy* is mainly the result of certain laws in many states that encourage the parents to live separately. I haven't lived in California for a while, but back in the eighties, a woman with a child could lose all her welfare for letting a man live with her. Welfare included free rent, free medical, food stamps, and over $200 allowance. A man would have to make at least two times minimum wage to improve her standard of living if he moved in with her.

Most of the output values are the same and the ones that aren't are multiples of each other. This seems like one step in a form of obsolete coin mixing that I read about back in 2013:
We each have a bunch of large denomination bills, we convert them all into quarters and add them to a big pot, split the pots up, move them around, then eventually take a series of pots of money that add up to what we put in (minus fees of course).
Better to mix/obfuscate Bitcoins by converting to darkcoins (Dash/Monero) or using foreign exchanges for deposit/withdrawals.

Actually I have had my Paypal TX fail to confirm many times. There is up to a week to do a tx from Paypal to a bank account. During that time Paypal has often frozen my account and stopped the transfer.
I know this because I use to sell Bitcoins on Ebay in batches. I had a seven day waiting period for delivery. When I made my sales, I would then transfer the money to my bank account. Once it was safe in my bank account, only then would I send the bitcoins. Often people would reverse their transaction (claiming their CC was stolen) and then Paypal would cancel the tx to my bank account.
It should be noted that even with proof of deliver (sending a paper wallet via registered mail) neither Paypal nor Ebay will honor sales of bitcoins. They will completely violate their own policies.

It costs me $7 to send $100 via western union, so that is around 7%. If there is an emergency and I need to send an extra $20 via western union that is $5, so they keep 20% of what I pay to them. There is a month last year that I sent $200 for $10 charge (about 5%), so I guess if I am sending large amounts of money, WU is okay.
Like most females, my wife is terrible with money, so being able to send a small amount ($25) every week is much better than just sending her a large sum ($100) at the beginning of the month. Western Union is terrible for sending small sums.
I noticed that you are using an exchange rate of about 91 shillings to the dollar. Western Union is currently giving 88.1 shillings to the dollar, so figure around another 3% hidden cost there.

There are a lot of people trying to buy bitcoin in the USA, but they are still waiting for approval on Coinbase. Coinbase is several months behind on approving new buyers. I am guessing about a million people behind. Even if each of those million want to spend just $1000 each, that is a $billion that is waiting to buy bitcoins. 
We actually need more exchanges to distribute the buying load for bitcoin, but laws in the USA prevent them. For instance, you can't buy Bitcoins in the USA through Coinbase or Gemini if you live in Hawaii or many other states due to hostile laws. We have to go overseas to buy Bitcoins.

Actually, I do agree. Malicious malware could change the contents of my clipboard, so I always double check the address that appears in my "pay to" field before sending anything.

Sounds like you are the one that failed economics. If you raise interest rates, the value of bonds decline. For instance, a ten year bond paying $1000 at maturity when interest rates are at 1% is worth $905 ($1000/1.01^10 ), but raise interest rates to 20% and the value of that bond will drop to $161 ($1000/1.2^10 ).

I use to send money to Kenya via Western Union. It was a pain, especially on my wife's end. She would have to spend 3-4 hours in line at the W.U. outlet. Also, if I wanted to just send a couple dollars, then xfer fees were totally excessive.
Sending her money using bitcoins only takes me a minute and shillings show up on my wife's phone within 15 minutes, thanx to bitpesa. Xfer fees are negligible too.
I would like to hear your alternative suggestion to sending money to my wife in Kenya. The method should cost less 3%, work as well for small sums as big sums, not require a bank account, and should not require travel or waiting in lines.

C.W. has done so many scammy things now, I would be reluctant even if he moved a large quantity of early coins.
There is one underlying personality aspect of con artists. They are always in charge of the evidence. This allows them to use convoluted explanations and misdirection.
C.W. is not even a good scam artist. I have met much better in prison. For instance Craig's amateur mistake of not noticing that S.N. always used double spaces at the end of his sentences. 
This is on top of mistakes like allowing people to see his verification script and catch him replacing the "signature" variable with the "signiture" variable. If he had capitalized the words, then he could have replace "SIGNATURE" with "SlGNATURE" instead, making this element of his scam much harder to detect. Like I said, definitely an amateur.

With Bitpesa, she is getting around 87 shillings per $ I send.
I am using Bitpesa now it is not only more efficient, but more convenient. Now she doesn't have to wait in line for half an hour or more at a W.U. office. There are Mpesa shops everywhere.
It is still cheaper than Bitpesa or W.U. to use an ATM. I am currently in Nairobi and just withdrew 11k shillings. My bank charged me a total of $121.42 for that withdrawal, so I am getting just over 90 shillings per dollar.

A chain split may double the number of coins, but is also doubles the amount of coins everyone has. So effectively, everyone still has the same % as before. This is unlike printing more fiat money which only goes to the rich and politically connected.

I think the government should have to pay all lawyer fees whenever a defendant wins. This would also encourage some good criminal lawyers to take on indigent cases where there is a reasonable doubt, since they would still be fully compensated in the end. I realize there would have to be a maximum amount like $1M  ($5M for capital crimes, the approximate cost of O.J. Simpson's defense) per felony charged.

Ok, interesting read. I know people that decided to never file an income tax return and of course they never get audited. When you are young and don't make much, you usually can get a minor refund, but when you get older and you start making a decent salary, that is when most people start paying a lot in taxes. So by sacrificing your small refund checks when you are young, you can avoid paying the big taxes when you get older.
It is a pretty safe strategy since millions of undocumented workers never file a tax return either. You are just a mote of dust in wind storm. As for withholding, they put down married with a bunch of kids to keep that to a minimum.
After reading some of your stuff, I see that it may not even be illegal. Hard to say though since the courts are so corrupt.

When Electrum sends from an imported key, it sends the change back to address. This is a safety feature, because people will sometimes import a key from a paper wallet, spend some of the funds, then delete the wallet. The change will still be their paper wallet (although you should always check of course!).
I am not sure how Electrum prioritizes which addresses to use first. I do know that you can freeze an address if you don't want Electrum to use it.
@_date: 2017-06-11 20:30:29
You sign the transaction offline, they even suggest that on their website. Since you are offline, they can't steal your private key. If you are worried that they will change the sending address during the signing process, you could check the tx before pushing it.
You could also check out the code, it is written in javascript, so fairly easy to follow.

You are where I was about 35 years ago. I was a computer nerd in college, hustled chess to make money, and never had a girlfriend. Other main problem was that I am 5'8" (still am) and only weighed about 115 lbs. in college. I just couldn't put on any muscle, although I was very athletic otherwise. I also lacked self-confidence due to an endless cycle of failures in finding a girlfriend.
This ended just after college when I went to the Philippines to visit my uncle who worked as a missionary there. It was like going to heaven, the girls were chasing me. I have two kids with a Filipina lady now (and 5 grand-kids). She divorced me years ago, but that was as much my fault as hers and I have moved on since then.
I have been back to the Philippines and to a few other countries, including Thailand and Kenya. In any of these countries, I am often approached by ladies if I go walking alone. Being white in any of these countries (Philippines/Thailand/Kenya) is like being a rock star in the USA. You can even start talking to someone before going over. For Asia, just set up an account at blossoms dot com. If you want to try Africa (btw, stick to Kenya or Southern Ghana), then use Afrointroductions dot com.
You also should learn some game. You can get a girl without game in those countries, but they will take advantage of you if you don't learn it and you will have a much better relationship if you learn the evolutionary psychology behind it. Check out some of the PUA stuff, learn to Neg (fancy word for flirting), how to deal with shit tests (and how to know the difference from a comfort test), AF/BB dichotomy, hypergamy, and why being a nice guy generally sucks (girls see it as weakness).
One last thing. The older you get, the easier it gets. Just take care of yourself and stay in shape. I am about 60 now and I have more girls chasing me than ever before.

Segwit2x with 4MB hard limit would allow 2 MB of non-segwit tx plus 2 MB of Segwit tx. With just Segwit, your non-segwit txs are still limited to 1 MB. You could do 1 MB of non-segwit txs and 3 MB of segwit txs with segwit, but that is not what is wanted by those over at r/btc.
You have to understand that there is a large group of people that want to increase non-segwit txs. Many of them don't trust Segwit and won't use it till they see how well it works for a while.

Government is ran by individuals and many of those individuals are investing in bitcoins. They will start undermining government attempts to destroy Bitcoin.
I saw some random video recently with a speaker talking about cryptocurrency to a bunch of bankers. He asked how many owned bitcoins and a lot of hands went up. These people are already getting ready for the big change. Remember, they could easily spend huge amounts of money and gain over 50% of all the bitcoins in circulation even if the price hit a $million each. So fiat dies, ultimately they still win, at least in their lifetimes.
It is like those cities where the drug lords have all gone legitimate. They start out young, make a few $million and start buying up businesses. Sure, most get caught and go to prison. But the survivors end up owning all the hotels, restaurants, gas stations, and car lots. They hire all the people and set the tone for elections. They end up running the local government. Making something in high demand illegal eventually gives more power to those who work with it.
I guess I am rambling here with some disjointed thoughts. Trying to outlaw Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will just give it more power in the long run. It has only been 8 years for this amazing technology, we have seen nothing yet, just wait another decade.

Not sure where we disagree on this. Most people I know work for themselves or a private company. They don't earn any **federal** income. If you do work the federal (or state since they usually get federal grants and stuff) government, then it would probably be best to file tax returns, since you would be under much more scrutiny.
According to Google there are about 2 million federal workers and a total of about 23 million public employees. I don't know any and suspect that most are concentrated in certain capital cities. I would imagine they are mostly conformists and would avoid doing anything legally questionable anyway.
I am referring to people like the local computer store operator. He fixes about 3 computers a day at a $100 each, only accepts cash and checks. He is open 7 days a week, so pulls in about $9000/month on repairs alone. He also sells a lot of refurbished computers. His expenses are about a $1000/month. His income comes from individuals and not the feds. He never files taxes.
Basically, no one is going to allege that he made over \~$11,500 in federal income. If they did, then I imagine he could file a rebuttal just like you mentioned earlier.
One of the great things about cryptocurrency is that it allows people to safely secure and hide their wealth. Otherwise, they would have to worry about the IRS grabbing it and putting them in a defensive position where they have to prove their innocence to get their property back.

In this case though, it isn't that the new cars are slower, it is that the speed limit is set to 50 mph for them, while the speed limit for new cars is set at 100 mph.
It would be like our government said they were raising the speed limit, but then the sign on the freeway says "Electric Cars 100 MPH, Gas Cars 50 MPH" and my gas car can easily do 100 MPH.
SegWit should just give all transactions the same 75% discount on weight, then everyone would be happy.

Don't P2SH addresses (start with a 3) include both multisig addresses and time locked addresses? If so, how do you separate them?

Oh shit, thanks to new government regulation, Gemini &amp; Coinbase won't sell bitcoins in your state. You check out Localbitcoins, but the closest seller would require you to buy a plane ticket. So now you have to register with some shady foreign exchange and wire your money overseas just to buy bitcoins.

Electrum can add the private key to the list of private keys used by the wallet. When you save the wallet, it also saves the private key that was imported.
You do need to keep the original private key as the 12 word seed will not recover private keys that are imported.

So lets assume I say yes? What do they ask next? I don't even know my bitcoin address by heart. What if I say the private keys are split on 2 computers, one in the USA and the other in Kenya?

How do you know he truly believed that? Maybe he was just trying to signal a false intention. He may have known the whole payout was a scam, but if other people believed that he was willing to commit murder to protect himself, then they would be less willing to extort him. Nobody really knows what was going on in his head.

In the ancient world before monotheism, after family, your loyalty in cities was usually to a religion, not the state. Kind of a religious tribalism. Monotheism ended that by combining the state and religion (we still have that in some areas, for instance Sharia Law). Would be interesting if cryptocoins returned us to that era. Doubt it would happen in our lifetime though.
Might make an interesting Scifi story. Set up a life based around different cryptos and their followers, a new mysterious crypto starts growing like crazy sucking up value from all other coins. The story then focuses on finding the mystery behind it's growth. After many clues and close death calls, our hero(ine) discovers that Satoshi Nakamoto has been resurrected as an AI system on a huge exaflop computer. Maybe he has gone insane and is trying to take over the world...or maybe he is being held hostage by nefarious forces...

Isn't Justin Bieber the guy that dies at the beginning of Zoolander 2? I can't even find the name of the actor that plays Justin Bieber. Just says Justin Bieber in the credits, like they got the character name mixed up with the actor name ;)

Plus "locked in a trust" would have required that the bitcoins actually be moved to a safe address. Imagine if you were in charge of a trust, would you just trust that the private key had no backup? Better yet, a trust should be using 2 of 3 keys or something like that. I just can't believe that those bitcoins are in a trust somewhere. 
Now maybe in S.N. personal safe deposit, that I might believe.

I feel good about Myriad for the following reasons:
* It had one of the fairest distributions according to this [source]( 
* It has both a web wallet and an Electrum type wallet. It even has a brain wallet if you know how to use those safely.
* There still seems to be a few developers keeping an eye on the code base.
* The five different POW algorithms seems to attract a diverse miner base.
* It is still in the early accumulation stage with a lot of growth possibility left.
With all that being said it is only number [ on the market cap]( This is so far down that it may never get anywhere. On the the other hand I feel that there is a 50/50 chance that it could go up a hundred fold in the next couple years. I have about 8% of my crypto-wealth there (other 92% in Bitcoin).
Occasionally it gets these huge spikes that last for less than a day. Just long enough to send some to Bittrex and sell it. I buy it back later once it drops. The great wallets (I use the Electrum clone) make me feel secure in moving it back and forth from the exchange. I don't need to leave it there.

Damn, even in the slums of Africa they don't have that problem any more. One day I was on a matatu (bus) at 6 am filled with young professionals. EVERY single one of them whipped out their Android. Well, except me, the poor American.

If true, that could have some major unexpected consequences on future politics. Imagine thousands of virtual nations each united around their own unique cryptocurrency.

The Billion Coin. While it is a true cryptocurrency (barely), it uses a centralized location to set the price. The price goes up by 3-5% per day. Each TBC coin is currently worth $41,439 each. There was a 500 million TBC premine, so that gives a market cap of over $20 trillion dollars right now ;)
TL;DR Decentralized Scam Coin

Switch to Electrum, you can even set the fee manually. You can also directly import your private keys and save on the tx cost of sweeping your funds in.

My dad was a professional magician and I can promise you that even the smartest people can be tricked.
We even tricked a bunch of other professional magicians once at a magician convention. We did this old trick that was commonly understood to use a pair of trick boxes, the old magicians just yawned and were to polite to say anything. My job (I was 9 at the time) was to start screaming that the boxes were tricks. My dad would look embarrassed, look around, then hand the boxes over to audience. At that point, everyone realized that the boxes were just normal. Sudden huge applause when the professional magicians realized they had been completely fooled.

Back in summer of 2013, an old Jewish gal I know, in her sixties, sold her house, bought about 2500 bitcoins and moved to Israel to be with her family.
Yes, it is only one old person, but she had more bitcoins than everyone else I knew put together.

To late, I already used the Sha256("my passphrase") result to create a time locked address. Those bitcoins aren't moving for a long time.
I have thought of adding a PBKDF option to my brainwallet [site]( Writing the PBKDF hash code is over my head, but I found some javascript versions of it using google and I could probably paste it in as an option.

Maybe it will be different this time, but so far history has shown that chain splits (Ethereum) result in higher prices.
