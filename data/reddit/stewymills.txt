So when I tip in Bitcoin does the streamer gets fiat? Or does he get BTC?

Please correct me if im wrong: So if you agree to sell bitcoins for cash you send the bitcoins to localbitcoins. Then you meet up and get the cash from the other person. Then once you received you tell local bitcoins to release the cash to the other party. Is this how it works?

Bitcoin doesnt have the overall utility to increase that rapidly. It will grow slowly as it slowly shows that it is a secure way to hold wealth.
