Woah man I have no advice. But sorry to hear  about this bro. Just think, it could have been worse and one of you could have been hurt. File a police report!

I agree that the cryptographic aspect of this currency should be apparent in the title. I believe they teach you such things in marketing courses.

As a fairly new crypto trader at the time, watching the bull market break barriers daily, and watching alt coins outperform bitcoin while my bitcoin quantity stayed the same, it felt like the only way was to get into alts.
At first I chased green candles on the hourly. I was successful because you couldn't lose in that bull market. By the time I developed the confidence to buy alts for mid term holding, the bulls ran out of gas. 
I went into the negative, both in bitcoin value and usd value at the same time. It hurt twice as much. The dead cat bounce to 17k had me thinking I'd be back to my original value in no time.  
Since then I've learned a great deal and I will be well prepared for the next downtrend. Until then I will have to continue to be a good slave in my day job.

It could be. But If it hits 6.6k I'll be much more comfortable.

Once everyone is convinced that the price is sure to drop, it is then that the price rises.

Agreed. I too welcome bank suppression.
