Bitcoin is, or at least was supposed to be, neither an investment or speculation. It was supposed to be currency. A tool for economic activity and nothing more. Partly born, or so at least some people claim, out of disgust how financial institutions used their position to gain enough power to unhinge any private or government institution that is supposed to keep them in check. But for now it is nearly pure speculation with many people here caring little but how much "real money" a coin is worth.

Looks like a digital central bank controlled fiat currency to me.

@_date: 2018-01-14 17:02:02
You can't. LN is designed to work with smaller and larger interconnected hubs similar to the banking system. The difference to banks is that these hubs don't control or can use your money so this service providers are more comparable to ISP's then banks. While a rather large amount of currency reserves are needed to build such an hub, I think it will be less centralized than mining already is.

This is how it really works:
* China blacklists address. Lets call it AddrA.
* Chinese mines will simply never accept a transaction as valid that has an AddrA Source.
* Let's say an US miner mines block 50, lets call it US50, with an AddrA transaction.
* Chinese miners will reject block US50 as invalid and just keep mining on block 50 (lets call it C50). At this point a network fork happens. The US50 block using miners have a heads start but the chinese miners have far more hashpower.
* Shortly after US50, C50 will be found.
* Every chinese miner will build on C50, but let's say everyone else will use US50.
* Because the chinese have more hash power the time difference between the US50 and the C50 fork will shrink down fast. Remember that unlike the US50 fork, the C50 fork is valid for everyone.
* Once the C50 based chain has overtaken the US50 based one, the shorter US50 fork will be automatically orphaned by everyone. The fork has healed. This isn't even extraordinarily, but something that happens randomly all the time because of miners finding a block in a similar timeframe. 
Even when discovered, there is nothing the network can do except somehow build up more hash-power or, more likely, jump ship.

No. The number describes percentage of total hashpower needed. 100% would mean ALL miners would have to be censoring. A maintained 51% attack is just an maintained 51% attack. It is true that in order to maintain control, they do have to keep mining. Something that would not be a problem for an entity like the chinese government.


How? Even if a hardfork is on the table, how would you distinguish a censoring miner form an honest one that can't be circumvented even with the power of the chinese government?

Making it illegal would probably be enough. Bitcoin crashes every time someone with an official sounding title farts at its general direction. 
If that is not enough, addresses can be blacklisted by regulating 51% of hashpower. Even completely freezing the system would be possible but more likely is that governments will create legislation that commercial miners operating in their country can not accept blocks that contain transactions with known addresses belonging to terrorist organization. If the same address shows up on enough lists to reach a 51% consensus, it is practically frozen.

You are forgetting the split in hash-power. True, the US50 fork would have a headstart, but the C50 has a much higher hashpower. To make the numbers simple, let's say the chinese have 60% hash-power, when in reality they have way more. When before the split 1 block was found on average every 10 minutes, after it will be 21 minutes for the US and 19 minutes for the C side.
The C side WILL overtake the US side eventually and when that happens, US50 WILL be orphaned.


Mathematically impossible. Not that they have a choice anyway.
EDIT: After the US fork is orphaned, the split will heal like any other and blocktime is back at 10 minutes.

No need to any of this. Short-time forks with blocks getting orphaned happens all the time and someone would need to do a really intense analyses to find out why a particular block was orphaned. Even if someone finds out, if they are invested into bitcoin, they have a strong incentive to keep this info on the down-low.


How would they do that? Even if they have the programming know-how, how would they even distinguish a filtering miner from a non-filtering one in a way that can not be circumvented by the chines government?


You mean Bitcoin Gold? Why would that alt-coin be preferable to Ethereum?


Maybe. But if the Chinese government sees bitcoin as a threat to their control over the nation, they are probably fine with either outcome.

It's called the 51% attack and simply a consequence of the bitcoin rule that says that the longest valid chain is the correct one. When Satoshi put this rule into place he thought that many private people would mine on their computers and that  it would be impossible for one person or group to accumulate this power.


By simply ordering all commercial mining operations within their borders to not accept certain transactions or blocks that contain them. Like donation addressees from known dissidents. Even if an outside miner would mine a block with that address, it would be orphaned quickly.

You can not compare bitcoin to fiat currency or bank accounts. If anything compare it to gold. One consequence is that bitcoin transfers is irreversible like you gave, or someone took your goldcoin.

Also, the mining period is rather limited to generate the wanted scarce.

I guess if facts aren't on your side, you have to resort to personal attacks. Deposits up to the insured amount(100k) where honored in full. Maybe YOU should read the article.

Yes. His property and no law that state he can't do with it as he sees fit.
Both cases where physical assaults. I doubt you would have seen an conviction without
a real crime attached to it.

The problem is not that it is founded on nothing, but that it is backed by nothing. Thats why it simply is not an currency like the US$ but would be an investment like gold. 
Unfortunately, while it may has the necessary scarce characteristic, it seriously lacks in the physical stability department. In fact, it is basically nothing else than a common dream in a worldwide P2P network. And while it is certainly hard to breach a thing like this, when it happens all bitcoin on the whole world would suddenly just vanish.
While the technology maybe used someday to sidestep the banking system for small Internet transactions with e-coins bound to a regional currency, I think Bitcoin itself is just another investment bubble. It would need no less but being adopted by an unified world government,society and economy to fulfill its promise of an real Internet currency.

What authority? To all governments its no more real then WOW gold. Thats the whole point of bitcoins. No government control, no government protection.

If you are serous about bitcoins use a dedicated machine (the cheapest linux netbook you can find) plus encrypted cloud backup for you savings wallet. Use E-Mail or QR to transmit the addresses from your normal use PC when necessary. If BC goes anywhere you will soon find mature Clients for Android (already there but experimental). When this happens an old sub 100$ phone/pad will be the perfect safe for BC. At least until the Blockchain becomes to unwieldy .

As much as i would like to see bc to succeed, this obvious crazy and scam-like suggestion to park larger amounts of wealth in an highly volatile and unproven virtual commodity keeps pushing me away.
@_date: 2011-08-06 15:01:59
As far as is understand it, the blockchain is the bitcoin system. It is basically a log file that contain all bitcoin transactions ever made and is distributed via P2P to all computers that run the bc client. When most peers agree the transaction is confirmed. This is what prevents the spending of the same coin multiple times.
Again. This is just the way i understand it. Someone with better understanding may correct it.

And what law was broken? When he goes on TV today and say he got bored with this nonsense and just deleted it all, what paragraph did he violated? He didn't hacked anyones computers or accounts. He didn't broke into a house, he didn't take an object. I can't sue reddit when they delete this post, just because I and my buddy's say it is a million dollar worth.

What it is, is a minority hardfork. Like Bitcoin Gold or Bitcoin Diamond. Trying to confuse people into believing it's the original blockchain makes it a scam.

You do know that Bitcoin as a self-issued FIAT currency?
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:56:31


That's not how it works. To be a commodity currency, it has to represent something else. Otherwise, it is fiat.


All bitcoin base rules, including how it is created, was decreed by the person or group hiding behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.
I readily agree that there are fundamental differences between programmed fiat and state controlled fiat. But it is still fiat.

Have you checked caps lock? Num lock on a laptop can also cause a lot of trouble. Either now or when the wallet was created
