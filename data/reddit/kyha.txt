Reporting who you paid for the BTC you buy is where you have to file the 1099-MISC, so IRS can keep track of where the cash has gone (i.e., who gets to pay taxes on it as income), the same way that anyone who gives more than $600 to any particular recipient in a given tax year must.  (My understanding is that it's not just "any purchase or transaction under $600", it's "any series of purchases under $600 aggregate in a given tax year".  If you buy more than $600 worth from a single vendor, you do have to report on 1099-MISC.)
But, as for your point...  I honestly don't know how US tax code handles it.  If I had to guess, I would suggest that it's like any other investment.  Track your basis (the amount that you put into your BTC wallet), and then if you get anything more out of your investment from your pool of BTC, you owe taxes on the gain.  (Under capital gains rules, unless I am mistaken.)
It doesn't have to be as insane as you make it out to be (140 lines) -- just track the money you've spent on BTC (your "basis"), then when you pay with BTC subtract the fair market value of what you buy (aka "US dollar price") from that amount.  When it's less than zero, it's a capital gain realized at the moment of the transaction.
(What's interesting is that from year to year, the prior years' capital gains are essentially reset to zero once you pay the taxes on them.  This means that if you buy $1000 of BTC and end up getting $2500 of goods out of it, you pay capital gains on $1500... then the next year buy $1000 of BTC and get only $750 worth of goods out of it, your basis of $250 carries forward for the third year.  Your basis itself doesn't adjust with inflation, nor does it earn interest other than what the investment itself nets.)
I am not an accountant, I was just customer service at a life insurance company where we had to send out 1099s for the "dividends exceed cost basis" situation on whole-life policies.
Also,  is important to show just how incredibly odd the situation truly is across every nation on Earth.  Again, I don't know how it actually works in US.  But this speculatory concept appears to make the most logical sense.
*Edited to explain that I really don't know for certain, and I'm just trying to apply the confusing rules that I see in IRS publications.  TALK TO A LAWYER OR CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT ABOUT YOUR QUESTIONS.

This is a concept called "escheatment".  5 years is 2 years more than most states give.
