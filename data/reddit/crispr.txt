it was a gamble. Somebody asked me if they should invest in bitcoin. I told them, it's a gamble. And I would tell the same thing again.

Inasmuch as I admire your bravery to stand up to draconian law, the laws could be made for different reasons including noble, but they are used for quite practical reasons, selectively.
This is a universal law of law  for all countries ruled by mercantile ideology.
This means that in your case you will be persecuted only if your case gets enough resonance. 
Example, somebody who does not like you enough will  bring it to DA.
Or it gets somehow to the front pages of major news media.
The bravery here  is nothing compared to the bravery of a person donating to any Islamic organization linked by US government to "terrorism".

I am already exhausted of holding back the laughter from reading this in the company of others. I have to continue in private. Thanks!

I found an interesting quote:
This is what was incriminated to Backpage:


If they completely eliminate any keywords, including code (euphemistic) keywords, how would consumers of such illegal ads know that the ad is about illegal service?
From the other hand, if they eliminate only straight language words from the ads, but leave the code words, how would that not _tip off law enforcement officials _ ? Surely, FBI should have known by now all the code words.
And if they remove the ad, that would prohibit law enforcement officials entirely from catching those individuals!
I guess the only compliance is when you clandestinely report every ad to law enforcement and do not publish it and it will be only a matter of a courtesy to inform the submitter: "Hey, your ad is suspected of selling child sex to people, we have reported you to FBI. Have a nice day!" 
Now _that_ business model will fly far, won't it?

Thanks for clarification. Hope it will be more visible
