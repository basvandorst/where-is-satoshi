You don't seem too bright.

Shirt seems like a double XL. Maybe start thinking about your health if you want to enjoy any wealth. 
Eat less. No one wants to love a planet.

I can't believe no ones ever thought of this before. Buy low!?

You're right when you say "if that's how you define bubble."
With the potential of a lot of volatility I don't really like to use the term bubble. Mostly because I am optimistic of Bitcoin's future.

If a "bubble" grows after it pops it isn't ever a bubble.

As long as you're investing an amount of $$$$ that you're okay with hodling it shouldn't be much of a worry

Yeah I bury her and make her gain 10lbs then marry.

You can’t beat yourself up with the “what if scenarios” because they are illogical. You did what you did and now that you know the volatility of bitcoin you can do what you do. 
Coulda been like that guy from r/relationships who bought at 17k and lost like $350k

He bought his first house at 23 and used it as a rental property. Then went from there searching for investments with at least 20% roi

That's all the information I could gather from spending 10 mins on his YouTube account lol

Wikipedia doesn't need your money. When that pineapple dude was donating his bitcoins someone shared an article saying why you shouldn't donate to them. 
I have no source because I'm lazy

Your dick is probably so awoke dude.

So you invest $300 in Bitcoin and now you are a warrior against government banking?

I'm on iOS 10.3.3 and bread works for me. Good luck though 
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:54:50

@_date: 2017-10-17 19:55:44

I'm slow and new ty
@_date: 2019-09-18 02:36:55
Drop some knowledge on how you got into rental properties. I want to pursue this path
@_date: 2019-09-18 02:40:43
Thanks, I’ll check this out. I’m finally in a situation where I am making decent money to make some moves. I’d like to be smart from the beginning
