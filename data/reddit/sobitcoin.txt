Will for sure. Going to do one with Dogecoin, and have submitted this on Bitcointalk as well. I really want to get a few details to help businesses considering adoption know who they are dealing with and demographics of who they can potentially reach. Thanks so much for partaking.

Right??? It's so easy to see a Mastercard commercial or promotion, because they profit from it. It's amazing to FINALLY see some mass marketing by a bitcoin company.  The community does a great job but it is hard to compete with big business profiting from their commercials. SO AMPED to see a Bitcoin oriented organization stepping up to the plate to reach the mainstream. The only regret I have is not being able to attending this event. Have fun everyone!

That will be a great conclusion to look at after the event.  I mean, you can look at the situation as a business potentially reaching millions with the message of bitcoin, or whine that people aren't going to keep it in Bitcoin. To each their own.

Apparently r/bitcoin downvotes legit suggestions these days.  There is 100's of options at the moment, many of which charge substantially less fees than any Bitcoin ATM operator.  I mean, the person above is referring to traveling 100's of miles to a Bitcoin ATM to pay user fees, and exchange rates, when the obvious, more simple answer is to log in, or not log in, to 1 of hundreds of places to purchase Bitcoins, in seconds,with very low fees.  Regardless, someone didn't do their research and down-voted a legitimate suggestion. Typical i guess.

This is not correct. You are comparing 1 service in the financial district to a currency, or a technology that facilitates transactions. Why wouldn't you compare a service that facilitates bitcoin transactions, to a service that facilitates monetary transfers.  This is a comparison of USD and BMO. Apples and oranges. Compare currency to currency, or financial institution to financial institution.  
\  
The correct comparison here would be a Bitcoin wallet maybe? WU compares to coinbase, bitpay etc... Not bitcoin.

I am just trying to clarify the rules here you really don't have to "attempt" to threaten me.

Question, and by the way, thank you so much for sharing. Would this soley include the word "Bitcoin" or would it refer to the logo or anything else as well?

This!  None of my friends use Bitcoin but they are warming up. The main issue for them is purchasing bitcoin with faith that it won't drop to nothing. And as a consumer, or currency holder, that's an understandable issue. All we can do is educate them to look at the history and see that there is some sort of value worth examining here. They will join us, I have faith.

Here is at least 20 places you can get Bitcoin for cheaper than any ATM, in seconds, from the comfort of the same chair you were sitting in when you typed that message.  . Yes, .001 would be easier to acquire than 1.0 because it's substantially smaller,pretty straight forward.  Did you do any research? Bitcoin is used as alternative currency, I find it amazing that people are frustrated that they are hard to come by". How did you pay for dinner today? By money you simply FOUND on the street? Probably not. Money is earned, i am not sure if tipping is devaluing it, but typically, money isn't just found or acquired. It is earned or traded for

K, does this mean say a debit card that would host the base funds, then a mobile wallet (phone or desktop etc) that would let you quick load or something with NFC, so you could manage the funds and spend quick with mobile wallet, but the base account is on the debit card, and safe.. Sorry for the paragraph. Had this shower thought last night. Whoever does this and issues kits that come with like a keytag, mobile download and debit card thing, that easily interact but keep the main security to the cold wallet (debit card), will be the one to bring BTC mainsteam.

I would imagine Bitcoin businesses are probably  concentrated in certain areas to appeal to bitcoin shoppers.  Perhaps the businesses are around, just haven't expanded to your neighborhood.  Hopefully they do, I think this is going to be a huge event for Bitcoin, you guys are lucky to have it in your town. Smile it will all be okay.

Hey just curious which services you used, maybe there's a few methods that are easier... Never had an issue with Circle.com or Trucoin as third party services to buy bitcoin... in seconds...  
Same with selling, there is nearing 00's of alternatives, could you specifiy which exchanges were annoying to sell on?  The low fees are alright, but the average consumer won't notice too much of a difference, i think the real savings comes from merchants willing to discount BTC  purchases, because they save huge on Credit/debit transactions. It is a fantastic way to send currency to a buddy across the world in minutes without relying on a bank for any part of the process.

Bitcoin puts the bank in your hands so to speak. It has to be viewed different then cash, but in comparison, would you leave a $20 on a table at a party? That's how i view hot/cloud storage.  If you have a cold wallet and manage it correctly it significantly reduces any risk, and puts the $20 in your pocket at the party.

Personally its more about being able to do the transfer from home without an intermediary service.

Or at least give people a reason to contribute. It's the whole "hey we accept bitcoin, now use it" deal. Not how it works. Give people a reason to be interested, and they will. It sucks, because I actually feel like people would have been down to contribute to this, if it was approached a little bit differently.
@_date: 2014-11-05 21:48:28
Yeah man you're right. The thing is, it's still quite unregulated.  Lots of the financial services are transparent and have faces to them.  Its just at the end of the day, you're putting money in a service, so the security is up to their standards, and at the moment, some of them aren't reporting to regulatory services in the same fashion as traditional services, so in alot of instances, you have to take the word of the organization for security.  
  
If you keep the coins in your wallet, you have the control.  It's just good for people to be aware, that some on here are very tech savy,and have the capabilities to do negative things. As long as everyone's aware! The way i look at it - Never leave a $20 bill out in public and it expect it to be safe. Keep it in yooo pocket =)

The thing is for services to get theirs, they need to have the service either go thru sign up, or host on their site. Dogecoin used to have a bunch, but never seen simple donate buttons for BTC.  Coinpayments has a simple checkout button and donate button, but it's hosted on their checkout i believe. Best oif luck with the search, if you find a resolution, let me know! The payment button from coinpayments I use is on this page under the feed if you want to look, can send you the code if you need!  6902 bits

Hey man. Basically, cold storage is the way to go with any savings or coins you don't need access to.. Removing the network keeps your savings safe....  When you keep funds in services, your putting security in their hands, that being said a number of them do a good job, but some have dropped the ball in the past,so just be aware... Physical storage is great though.... Use cloud wallets and services when ya need to spend/exchange etc, but try to keep your fund close to you as much as possible  
  
 If you're from the states try circle.com to purchase quick. Canada I use CAVirtex.  There's a bunch of options though. If you have any other questions let me know!  
  
-Quick places to buy, sell exchange crypto currencies   
-Directory of listings for places to spend

I have 0 love for businesses that put the transaction fee on the customer, and REFUSE to support their business. I don't care what you're selling, if your margins are that small, you really need to rethink your strategy and look in other areas to save capital.

I always thought Western Union was crazy for the confrontation.  As a financial exchange service, widening their offerings and integrating Bitcoin exchanges into their current structure seems like a move that would have generated endless publicity, perhaps earned them a few new customers, and widened offerings, for relatively low cost (from an outsider perspective).    
Guess that's out the window for now.

Hey! Bitcon is a value exchange system.  It allows you to send, receive currency over long distances without reliance on third party services.  It provides a public ledger of transactions and enables multiple users to have access &amp; control single accounts. very cool broad technology.  You should wait till you are 18 to gamble BTW, however on the bright side, when you are 18, you will have the freedom of quick deposits and withdraws between poker/gaming/casinos without signing up for financial services and avoid paying expensive withdraw fees.

Awesome contest.  I would love to join one of these conferences one day, it seems as though this would be a great place to learn from the innovators and entreprenuers guiding the Bitcoin ecosystem.  The level of interaction and involvement at these conferences would be a great entry point, learning space and networking environment.  Unfortunately (but not really unfortunately) many of us are from international space and it's challenging to come up with the capital to attend these events including plane tickets and accommodations! One day =)   
   
  
I cannot attend this event due to being all Canadian, but I hope you guys find the perfect candidate who deserves to be present but can't financially find the means to participate. Best of luck, will be waiting to stream the hell out of every speaker the following week, should be to say the least, a very interesting time for a conference!

1. - Bitpay, I believe coinkite and coinbase offer automatic lock/deposit, meaning after sale the rate you sell your products at are locked in at time of sale, and automatically deposited into your bank account.... Volatility, gone.
2.  Share the benefits with them, why would THEY personally benefit from Bitcoin?  Could they use it for tipping, buying products? Perhaps they frequently send money internationally, Bitcoin is a great way to save $ and time, opening the door to sending money anywhere, anytime, no services necessary. 
3. Bitcoin accepted badge on website, some in store signage, and I really think every business accepting Btcoin should print off some paper wallets or invest in self branded physical storage for customers and clients wanting to try.  Perhaps preload some with 5$ 10$ 2$ increments, hand them out with purchases over 50$, or 100$.  Startup 1 night a week to educate clients.  You haven't stated what business your inbut if it was retail, you could offer special bitcoin discounts on educational nights in which customers trying bitcoin would save on regular purchases.   
  
3.  I believe it is acounted for as a medium of trade or commodity at fair market value.  The actual hardships in the books seems to come from holding coins and accounting for the volatility, which step  would avoid, i also think these guys provide invoices for easy book keeping. Here's a free service that helps out -

I am not defending any point here, I can see both sides of the cake,  but in this world of decentralized currency, why are we centralizing a bitcoin conference to the North American Bitcoin Conference? What is wrong with a number of people hosting their own, is this not the way this community functions?  It seems quite hypocritical... I hope this guy isn't allowed to talk, but the impact might be greater if people in here show up to provide real life thoughts, in person.  Nothing speaks more truth than an up close and personal with the asshat who is personally responsible for thieving all your finances.... Just my opinion.

I agree, and my knowledge is lacking about the whole scenario.  I do feel there is a rather large outcry which should be addressed, and the last minute movement of a Q&amp;A to a custom venue is a little odd especially following what in my eyes is a rather decent sized public story. It will be interesting to see how everything plays out. I would imagine sponsor contracts are binding to some degree of this on both parties.  Just a little unsure why a last minute venue change would be in the best interests of a Q&amp;A that has been scheduled for a while, and if sponsors of these events typically request this sort of thing last minute. I was rather looking forward to the scheduled Q&amp;A provided in the atmosphere every participant at the event is subject to.

Hey! Here's a few (12) options  You have one way and two way. After speaking with a few owners, everyone seems to agree two way is the way to go.  Lamassu is definitely a popular option. I have used Bit Access, and it went super smooth, great software.  
Generate a strategy around it.  How much you guys are going to make, and how it can be used to up sales and generate foot traffic in the bar so everyone is benefits... Run some promotions get a buzz in your community so it draws some media attention. A lot of the companies have a lead time, to get shopping!  Here's a thread with a little ATM discussion as well  Best of luck, super cool to hear.

Hey there!  Yup!  I believe they are a Vancouver Based company that accepts the largest amount of ALT currencies as well as Bitcoin.  I haven't had any troubles with them... I know they received a few hundred k in funding a few months back. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 14:01:50
The thing is, his should be an easy answer for anyone going public with these decisions. What an idiot.
@_date: 2015-01-11 16:51:56
Plenty of reasons. Word of mouth is arguably the most influential medium of marketing.  For example two interesting statsistics -  ***"Consumers are 71% More Likely to Purchase Based on Social Media Referrals"*** (Great opportunity for tipping promotions to create a buzz around your brand) ***"word of mouth is the primary factor behind 20 to 50 percent of all purchasing decisions"*** (The opportunities exist)... Educate, excite and involve your customer, and there is a good change they discuss you with their social circle.  I am firm on the belief that someone who wants to spend Bitcoin will, and if you are the single available industry option, you will experience visitors such as the story above.  I see an opportunity to build loyalty. In short - 
1. Low cost opportunity for effective marketing... Bitcoin is just another innovative ***reason*** to involve, educate, excite and connect with your customer. That lies in the promotions and value added incentives, there are plenty of businesses running great Bitcoin promotions, it depends how creative you get.   
2.  Save $ in the LR. Merchants save capital on merchant fees,which are quite expensive.  In the long run, encouraging a % of your sales in bitcoin will be noticed in the books.  Bitcoin is a learning curve, why not use this to your advantage.  Run weekly educational tutorials in your stores off hours, open the store at a discounted rate... Use bitcoin to push more sales, give discounts for large quantities, why not have unique Bitcoin upsale.. sales during educational seminars... You are free to manipulate your promotions as needed to reach the goals guiding your Bitcoin integration. 
  
I think lots of businesses view it as a promotion, and become bitcoin "acceptors".  Want to be a bitcoin "seller", prep for supporting retail promotions. I would also argue it depends how you look at it for the work load.  In the grand scheme of things, it might be a day of work to achieve a good increase in margins... at least by transaction fee value, according to Coinify, a steady 3% increase (Definately an area for market researc for the future, but including the learning curve and speaking with the community, I believe that people who take the time to learn and get involved with bitcoin are more likely to spend bitcoin and show loyalty to the brand that introduced and educated them, this is 100% speculation and definatly something I want to research in the future)
  


  
Doesn't seem like an answer coming from a motivated business owner.  Create strategy, learn regulation, locate merchant tools you will use, educate staff, ensure there is a place to get Bitcoin in/close to your retail atmosphere, brand paper wallets, create educational material, set up signage, and a few supporting promotions that will create excitement and give your target value.. GOgogo.. What worked after a few weeks, what didn't.   A day of work... a few hours of work to show that you are behind your promotions and believe in what you are selling will go a long way. Never forget ***1,000 customers can potentially generate 500,000 conversations about a brand.*** In this case, Bitcoin and your brand.

@_date: 2015-01-06 15:38:10
I think yes as well. That i guess would be up to the business to implement, but as any retailer, they could be accepting bitcoin in literally 5 minutes retail and ecommerce.  Open the doors to new customers, generate a loyal fan base by educating them about bitcoin, extend to already integrated consumers.. all with no volatility. Sounds like a win win to me.
@_date: 2015-01-17 22:16:30
"Bitcoin eliminates the need to have a Western Union-like remittance service."
  
  
Your last sentence about Bit Pesa does exactly what WU would do, they take a currency, facilitate the transaction with an output of the currency that is needed.  No different.  
  
Exchanges that are based in your country EX CAVirtex - Canada, allows you to avoid the 3% of Bit Pesa and do the conversion yourself, in to your own bank account.  There is pretty much an exchange that tailers to the bank currency of each nation now, I really think Bit Pesa does nothing but what WU does for traditional FIAT, send through a service that takes a % to facilitate the transaction, defeating the purpose of a wallet to wallet transaction, an defeating the purpose of low bitcoin exchange rates.

What deems a reputable exchange these days... being jacked 5 million? Defiantly a whole bunch that haven't been, in which case i would consider them more reputable not less. I think the reputable standards have changed over the last 2 days lol  
If you are going to downvote me justify your opinion, feel free to leave a reason why bitstamp will still be considered a reputable exchange after being vulnerable to one of the largest hacks in bitcoin history? Just curious... My apologies if I am out of line assuming a company dealing with 100's of millions of dollars on regular basis might be proactively protecting against this shit.    
You think anyone is going to take Bitcoin seriously when this is happening monthly/weekly. These hacks need to stop or people simply aren't going to hold bitcoin, pretty simple.  Reimbursement or not, people don't want their money in  spot it's going to get stolen, and at the moment, there is not a whole bunch of trusted services, Bitstamp was one of the final straws for myself. If they are losing this much, who is next. Exchanges are insanely important to the ecosystem, if they can't be used without any trust, there is a bit issue.  Yes, coins should be stored in multi sig, 2fa, cold storage.... But at some point an exchange will be used, and dam wouldn't it suck if it goes down in that 1 hour you take your savings out for actual use.  
On a daily basis i talk to people completely unfamiliar with bitcoin, and there is 1 common response from EVERY person who has heard of it, it is a scam, and that GOX crashed it.   
This isn't a downvotable problem. It's real and real important to fix.

This would be used as a complete organizational strategy, not just promotion sake, however on the marketing end, it would definitely generate publicity and help change customers perception of the current service.    
   
I hear a whole bunch about the lack of marketing value around here. As a current reference, what was invested into the ALS video promotion?  What was spent on commercials and mass marketing mediums...?  The value of generating publicity through low cost, non traditional mediums (guerrilla marketing) is realistically endless and bound by creativity. The supporting promotions of Bitcoin integration would be up to them.    
  
For a financial institution to integrate a new currency would show a whole bunch of similarities.   IT would be another physical location aside from ATM's where people can purchase and send Bitcoin. Why do "thousands of geeks" currently already use Bitcoin ATM's and physical locations for exchanging Bitcoin.... The same reason they would use WU as a Bitcoin exchange, not to mention the thousands that would consider Bitcoin from daily exposure...or WU's potentially increased margins dealing with Bitcoin.   
I am not aware of their accounting practices, and I understand there would be capital involved in training staff and accounting + other admin.  The initial launch program would endure the majority of capital, but once the education is in place at each location, future staff education would be quite cheap,  and additional accounting costs would be understood, which to me seems as though it is focused around adjusting market values while the business holds coins.  As a financial institution that  already has steady access to all the financial &amp; administrative functions necessary to complete financial transactions from start to finish, I would imagine the integration could be completed relatively cost effectively, that's just my assumption.     
   
As I noted before this is not a promotion, it's a complete strategy.        
To move in to a new, innovative market as an early adopter in my eyes would be a good move and relatively low cost.  I am not going to write up the financials, but I would imagine the administrative Blockbuster staff had a similar discussion when considering the integration of digitally based media services.

I honestly see nothing wrong with regulation. It's everywhere. The thing is, this is insane. Where does bitcoin need regulation? With the people starting exchanges, financial services and managing millions. GOX and moolah are great examples of businesses that should have been hindered by regulation due to complete 100% incompetence. Didn't happen.  Why punish the consumer..... Not the end consumer. What the fuck.

There are definitely a few benefits to spending Bitcoin in certain environments. Just have to locate the services offering Bitcoin discounts, but have come accross good discounts on Hosting services, games and more using bitcoin.  Just google what you want to purchase with "save with bitcoin" or similar, sometimes a 10 or 15% discount will pop up.   
Edit: Found this site with a few:   
Save 15% on hosting -

Absolutely.  I also think it's a little easier to educate your staff than you make it seem. I guess this would be dependent on turnover rates and industry, but telling someone the basics of Bitcoin really isn't that hard.  A bitcoin transaction is just as easy as traditional payment, if you understand how to load a web browser and let the customer scan the screen, it really isn't much more then that.  Additional education, why not bring staff in 20 minutes early one day, print off a few guides for the back room, give each of them $10 in Bitcoin to go home and learn with...

I think it would only impact indirectly.  The value form buy and sell orders would mean that the stolen coins would either have to go on sale, or perhaps a large exchange like bitstamp would close down, but i still don't think that would effect price unless they had to liquidate btc to cover costs, which in the past with DPR seized assets was controlled and seemed to be decently set up so it didn't effect market. Good Q, curious what others will say.

I have bought a few things, coffee for one.  The internet connection was bad, it took a long time to receive, and they looked surprised that I used bitcoin. Can't stress enough that if retailers are going to accept Bitcoin they will find more success with an educated staff, using Bitcoin as a payment strategy and not just another promotion!  Involve your customers, get excited about bitcoin, run promotions that help encourage education and adoption and use it as a marketing tool to build clientele and generate word of mouth, don't just slap up a bitcoin accepted sign and hope for the best.  
Thanks for sharing your experiences! Must find a way to encourage effective adoption.

I think merchants definatly help the volume of sell orders by instant exchanging through the popular wallets, with that being said, the theory would be more merchants accepting would encourage consumer adoption, so if a merchant is accepting it, perhaps their customer base would also, followed by buy orders... So, i think they do help volume, the current direction of that could be argued.

There is noooo way it works like this. Credit card companies hav margins to operate with... They have debts to collect, and employees to pay. There is some other avenue from the same consumers making up for the changes, money doesn't come out of thin air.   
As for Visa and Mastercard, I don't see them trying to compete. They are too large and on top of things.  I can imagine right now they have a team looking at the technology, seeing how it can integrate and where they can make their money, safely.

Bang on man.  I swear we are all the outsiders in our groups, this seems to be a common thing here.  My buddies are 100% the same. No matter how much education /  ideas I pass them, they don't seem to currently see a NEED to change their perfectly good money into another currency that they don't know about.  The more I put into them, they get interested, but are still very far off from actual adopting.  I think the common denominator is that none of them have had a bad experience with / see a reason to switch.  They all voice that the transaction fees from their bank don't effect them because it's something that has always been there, so it wouldn't force them to a new currency.  That being said, I always run into this problem - buddy coming over, want him to grab something that is on the way and close to his house, usually a coffee.  He is broke, no money to get it.  With bitcoin i can send him 4 bucks for two coffees in 10 seconds. Or, go get it myself and backtrack, or interac which takes 30-40 minutes + fees.  There is real world use for everyone who don't seem interested yet, they just have yet to realize, make use or consider the potential, and I think with popularity, more people consider these little things.

That chart looks a whole lot more complicated then, numbers, as everyone has been taught since day 1.  So now the goal is to redefine the number system as well as financial. Nice, big piece of pie, can assume where this goes from here. Is Bill Gates the niche market bitcoin applies to now?
@_date: 2015-03-08 17:39:03
Sometimes I wonder why someone would join a conversation with accusations of a scenario, they really know nothing about.  But then I realized we are on reddit, the place where RegulatedByMath can temporarily eary his stripes, act smart as a rocket scientist.... You sir/madam are a dumbass, your ability to draw that I shove bitcoin down my friends throat justifies your idiocy and willingness to jump to conclusions with 0 evidence.  But, hey some people part tie reddit, full time genius, i get it.   
So my friend lets take a walk down your list of inaccuracies...  
1. Used google yet? It's a "search engine".  One of those things you can find internet things on. Yeah, do a quick google search for Bitcoin discounts, perhaps add a term if your feeling a little crazy today.  What  you will find is plenty of retailers offering 10% + discounts for bitcoin payments, which would insinuate that bitcoin is 10% cheaper or more, if you do you homework. I am broke, but I shop alot online, Bitcoin has saved me LOTS of money, especially purchasing eVape products.  Your buy sell costs included, none of these fees come to over 10%, or close for trading fiat for BTC over an exchange. All fees included, plenty of savings if you look.   Some people have disposable money, and do not care about savings. Others do, and have more time to look for savings. Realize, not everyone thinks, spends and works like you do.   
     
2. What volatility?  I have relatively little money, but when I wish to purchase / use bitcoin, I goto one of many exchanges, swap for BTC and in 2 minutes, I have what I need to do what I was doing.   The subjection to volatility is again, a personal fundamental.  I have never stored bitcoin for long timeframes, and have never lost or gained lots on volatility.  Not all people are storing bitcoin, please consider people's personal uses for bitocin and not your picture of what EVERYONE does with it.    
  
3.  You can look at it as limiting yourself to businesses accepting bitcoin or capitalize on the benefits provided by busnesses accepting bitcoin.  There is a half full and half empty cup, which one did you choose? Pretty obvious.
  
  
It's unfortunate that you take such a radical stance on bitcoin.  There can be a payoff, it depends who you are and how you view the situation, what is iportant to you in purchases etc.  It's going to be different for every income, class, and you clearly cannot impose your judgements on a bitcoin holder as a whole.    
  
Likewise, your view seems to come from the point of someone who has decided to throw fiat away and only use bitcoin.. Which is not recommended, the case, ever discussed, or any part of any conversation.   Nobody has ever suggested solely carrying bitcoin...   it is an alternative.   
   
Now, to me continuing to shove Bitcoin down my friends throats...Are you a party of my circle? You understand how i approach my associates?  You've heard our conversations? I will ignore your naive idiocy. You have no idea how i communicate with my social circle, will never understand it, and my frined you think you know a whole lot more then you do.  Take the stick out of your ass, shut the fuck up before you talkand consider looking at the world in a more positive light, more homework, less idiots, please.

Haha that's the spirit.  I feel your pain.  In Canada, we have a pretty small volume too, so it can def be hard to locate an easy spot, but once you've found one it's game on.  As many have said, local bitcoins is a pretty good place.  Also, if you get the mycelium wallet on your phone, you can goto "Buy &amp; Sell" bitcoin in the main wallet and it will show you everyone selling Bitcoin's around you.   I guess it depends how easy / the rate you prefer.  Some of the services I call "Quick Buy" exchanges let you buy fast at a premium, but can be worth it for these situations.  Best of luck friend!

"payments" are a nice market. I exit. Best of luck. I understand what you are saying and think you are manipulating data to support your claims.  Anyone who states/ defends that payments are a niche market needs to get their head out of their ass... In addition, the term payments blankets ***anyone*** who transacts value, which is everyone in the world.   Your reference to trading markets definitely refers a NICHE group of individuals with disposable income, who trade currencies. Not everyone trades currencies. Everyone, spends, money.  Have a good one fellow bitcoiner. (Also see it as an asset to bitcoin when we can both debate for the same end point, in a different light of achieving it... pretty cool thing Bitcoin has here)

@_date: 2015-03-08 18:20:19
Okay here goes! Not sure if this will work but what is my biggest problem with bitcoin -   
Accountability for those breaching security - I would like to see a little more effort on the businesses side to guarantee funds.  Things happen, but there needs to be preventative measures for the end users.     
Consumer Volatility - Had this discussion with many and it is the sole reasons keeping my friends away from bitcoin,... There is going to be no way to protect, but if there was some sort of smart wallet that one could set with simple margins and ensure that in the event of an extreme down or up swing, the wallet would automatically ensure your funds are converted and stored in that currency (fiat or btc). I know this would be hard to achieve and is acting as an exchange, but I think if someone could set a price floor on their wallet and know, that if i have $300 today, if the price dives down to $225, my wallet will have swapped my btc for fiat at $350.  Not sure if this is possible, or if it could spark an idea, but some sort of consumer protection.
@_date: 2015-03-04 17:28:33
Look at my very first sentence form our exchange. I said, no shit, bitcoin holds vale in many areas, CLEARLY.  The fact is, nobody understands bitcoin, and your emphasis on getting more technical with it, before the average joe understands its basic function is dumb.  Likewise, you use your motivation to advertise fora wallet, which your article is regarding, yet you don't reference it at all  anywhere here, or in your title.   Yes, no shit, trading markets have high volume....    You can spell it out in any language, or in any terms, it doesn't change the basis of the numbers.   What I am trying to say is that in trading markets a few individuals can be responsible for a large volume, your large numbers don't represent large  of users or population, they represent movement of finances, which can and will still be attributed to a small group.  You are trying to explain that more people daily trade commodities and currency, then use for payments, which doesn't really make sense.

Man all I want to see if proof. New to the story. Read all the above articles.  I have seen a bunch get talked out, but am yet to see 1 actual sheet of paper, bill, dime spent on something unlawful or realistically any instance of a fraud.  Can you please specify? I am not saying you are wrong, but I think if anyone is going to focus on calling out a guy who has fed well over 100k homeless people meals in what seems to be pretty good faith, surely there should be some sort of concrete evidence, financial statistic, or some sort of evident basis for the negativity.  What exactly has been done here?

Circle has done a great job bringing bitcoin to the average consumer.  They are the first company I got my bitcoins with and the easiest to date.  They get bashed for asking the same questions that coinbase and other companies that are working follow regulations ask.   This place likes to turn against companies that have turned a profit or been successful, probably won't change.   Bitcoin is a great utility. The ones focusing on bringing this int the real world instead of getting involved with the r/bitcoin bs are the ones doing everyone a favor. Thanks guys

I don't know if you are arguing for the ske of it, on discussing your opinion, because you keep referring to these numbers that you have interpreted in one light and fail to acknowledge... anything I have pointed out. Can't have a conversation with a brick wall, or someone who is set in stone. Have a great afternoon, no sorry's here, not sure what statistics you derived those from.

All you really care about is embedding your point of view, which I do not agree with.  Every message is trying to educate me with your specific interpretation. Each comment refers to two numbers, one being larger, in which you have someone decided in your mind, that you have won some kind of argument....   So simple, and to be honest, I have no idea what your point is, so I could never agree with it.  You have interpreted two numbers, in which you believe you have the perfect recipe for people understanding Bitcoin, which blows me away... Probably, should start marketing your efforts and bring the to the public as you are the Bitcoin messiah and have all the answers. Unfortunately, I don't buy into your bullshit, nor do I agree with your un-open-minded approach to looking at two numbers that separately have multiple unique implications internally influencing each one that you have somehow avoided acknowledging.   Have a good one. You are arguing an unproven opinion, that in your mind is correct, yet has 0 track record of success.  Good luck with that.

@_date: 2015-03-18 02:27:27
And to be fair a whole bunch of them approach bitcoin as a get rich quick, the same as lots of it's holders.  Businesses considering integrating should seriously consider developing a marketing plan around it and know exactly who they are trying to target.  It's happened to both businesses in my town that used to accept it. Put up "accepting bitcoin" sign and wait for a copious amount of Bitcoin consumers to roll in.   Doesn't work like that, I think success comes with a complete strategy.  Bitcoin is a great reason to interact with any visitor/customer, whether they use it or not.

You realize this is a business, with a business plan, financial statements, and a real marketing strategy, with real professionals at work?  What about guerrilla marketing? or vertical integration, pricing, partnerships, offerings as a whole?  Remember the other day when Coinbase decided to stop their tip button... Do you think this was a decision that popped out of the sky, or potentially there was marketing theory behind it?

In the last 30 days the number of wallets generated has grown 5.26%, pretty amazing, more fun stats here  .  I am not sure about their numbers or the revenue they are generating, it would be cool to know, mind if I ask where your information is from?   I am not saying dropping ChangeTip is a marketing move that is going to bring them succes, I am saying it was a calculated measure by a team that you stated was not doing enough.   
  
Sure they need to get out to the masses, and that is probably what they are currently working to achieve with their strategy.  I am stating in response that you are overlooking a number of decisions and avenues that would qualify and be overlooked by the marketing team.  30 second commercial slots and billboards aren't the only way to grow a brand.    
I am honestly not disagreeing with you, just pointing out there is more to the picture than the top 3 mediums of mass marketing, and from the stats I can find, they are doing fine. Without knowing their growth plan, target and strategy exactly it's hard to say what they are and are not doing, but they seem comfortable with their success up until this point and it seems to be moving in the right direction.  You also don't need to brag about your success, but if you are going to call out a successful organizations' marketing team in a public discussion board, at least come up with something creative other than "make a commercial", or, if you insist, make sure to provide defense as to why it's a good idea, who it's going to reach, how many people, your estimated growth and revenue generated from your superior ideas.

From an unbiased approach (don't use their services, learned about history in this thread)....   Considering the owners involvement in a multimillion dollar scam, can you please elaborate on what the decision indicators for your wallet/exchange services are?  Innovation triumphs security in your books? You would prefer to use a service that innovates, knowing your coins might be gone in the morning?  Secondly, you judge their security based on an expert who spoke at a conference... Could you perhaps elaborate on their qualifications?
  
Just trying to understand your approach to storage of hard earned assets/finances.  I think this is a mentality that really feeds the negative motivations in this space... Not enough research, too much trust in people you don't know holding your money.   
Trying to understand, with all the lost coins across exchanges and platforms, why, anyone, would consider trusting a business with a back log of quite plausible scenarios, regardless, lots of coins that went missing under a platform that is ran by the same person.  Perhaps this person wasn't directly responsible for lost coins, but their operations would have been. What has changed, why have the previous negative entities that threatened the previous exchange suddenly disapear? Nobody is worried about potentially negative networks from previous business trickling into the new VC startup?    
   
Just do your research and due diligence please, before putting your money, into a service that has a checkered past, has an unclear future, is a financial services started by entrepreneurs without financial history, is a brand new company without a successful track record. Demand security checks and transparency of everything.
  
The trust level in here is fucking insane... Scam, scam thread. Scam, scam thread, repeat?

Considering that he had the USA name/business accounts in his name, has he escaped, or is he going to be held accountable as the chat logs would suggest he understood the instability and consequences of the situation but decided to proceed anyhow.  Is TheDownVot involved with the information/insider knowledge process?Wat was his involvement knowledge of the situation.... I believe he was in the dark the whole time... but the whole team couldn't of been, is boffin going to be held liable for providing the avenue for 000's of americans to lose their money, knowingly?  How/when are the funds going to be recovered?  Are any of the charitable donation for Funds for Carlito going to be recovered? Are there criminal charges being pressed for the creation of a donation based initiative with militias intent from day 1???? Why is Alex Green indicted?  Theft, fraud, both, falsifying documents?  What is it, there is 100,000 laws broken, which ones are being followed up?  What about the American PIE investments?  Has Alex Green broken any laws across boarders that will require legal proceedings?..... What is he being charged with and what is being over looked?  Who else is being questioned? Any r/dogecoin mods involved with the information process, as they did a whole bunch of work with moolah to bring NASCAR to life, are they involved with the legal proceedings or providing any information to the authorities?  Who else?  There is thousands of people who interacted with the Moolah team on a daily basis, who was selected to provide case information and why? How has there not been an investigator in here leaving a phone number for information?  What is being overlooked with the lack on communication here? What about any other community members that interacted with moolah on a daily basis over the last year?  Are these charges UK based only, or a blanket for everyone who lost funds globally?  Are the funds going to be recovered? If so how does one go about the process? 
@_date: 2015-02-24 18:07:15
Hey sorry, didn't mean that to come off rude, just wanted to point out the questions that have been floating in my mind.. This is true, very large difference between the two, just curious at what point the people who lost their coins are involved, as they are the ones effected by the criminal and theft aspect of Moolahs operations(everything).  Personally I didn't lose anything, but i was in the dogecoin group speaking with moolah employees everyday, (calling them out everyday).  I would imagine the dogecoin groups chat logs would be quite an asset to any proceedings as a number of the financial expenditures of moolah regarding dogecoin fundraising was discussed in there.  So, if any, I see that there is a federal case, and a civil case regarding the lost funds of sys/mynt.... Who is representing the people who's funds were stolen? The guy who lost $10.00 and doesn't want to spend 10,000 on a lawyer to get it back?  Who is representing the carlito funds, created in the name of someone who is no longer with us, with the front as a donation initiative, purely for profit?  Who is looking at the funds invested into Dogecar? The remaining 5000$ worth that Moolah contributed, which Moolah.io account were those funds from? Is anyone getting them back? Are any of these cases even looking at these?  I see two blanket cases in which none of the end users are looked after, and a number of criminal charges are un-prosecuted or overlooked. Oh well i guess

@_date: 2015-02-05 06:24:58
I think for these situations the best instance would be to approach them with a few tangibles they can sit on after you give them your presentation.    
    
Definitely point out the fact that bitcoin integration is a strategy, not just a promotion.  It will require their own knowledge and marketing materials, as in my town, a number of merchants have put up "Bitcoin Accepted" signs, with 0 promotion, after a year, none of them had conducted any transactions except for myself, and today, no longer do any of the 3 accept it.   
  
So i guess an information pack that includes: the bare basics of what bitcoin technology is, how it is used with wallets and exchanges (recommend services), it's core utilities in a consumer, merchant and general setting, the estimated demographics that comprise the community, and all the potential monetary, technical/utility and marketing potential that comes with Bitcoin.  I think a well designed package of 5 or so pages will really help with insight into why they should be interested and give them information to ponder after the fact perhaps a list of essential resources and graphics.  
  
Also, since your a BitPay person, it would be cool to be packing a tablet, mobile device, laptop and physical storage so you can show them exactly how transactions between the bunch flow and let them try the process with your guidance for the first few times.  Definitely try showing them on their own devices so you can get the necessary software installed and BitPay accounts set up, they might just tinker around next time they come across the icon =)  
    
If you do happen to encourage a business successfully, maybe focus attention to that immediate area, surrounding businesses and promoting to the general public and encouraging participation and generating interest, perhaps partnering with the businesses to get compensation for co-promotions (oh hey this is bitcoin, and guess what these guys accept it), giving you a reason to be out there, and driving them interest.      
Perhaps consider contacting your local news station after a little success to see if they will do an interview in which you can give a Bitcoin speal and help educate the public on who accepts it locally.... I think people really underestimate the fact that lots of smaller news stations are always looking for new content and will cover anything if you make it sound appealing in the telephone calls &amp; emails. 
  
Once you get a few merchants on board, opening the network for all of them to get involved together as somewhat of a bitcoin accepting community will help boost the general bitcoin image in your area and perhaps generate cash flow for some multi-vendor bitcoin marketing.    
Wish you the best of luck, something I would love to do as a job! Keep me updated!

Marketing is about building a business and creating an effective brand.  Could you elaborate.  This is about the most vague definition of something so broad, and actually, these would be properties or goals, but I believe marketing is to inform, persuade or remind... at least it used to be.   What are your credentials?  What about social marketing? Guerrilla marketing? Neither are directly about "building an effective brand" or building a business, instead they typically have direct goals which contribute to these basic, broad points.  You take a marketing class bro? Two?  Oh tangible results.... Well, surely any marketing philanthropist surely would understand the importance of providing statistical evidence as defense for your claims and assumptions... "tangible results" "positive"... Less words, more evidence of your exceptional, superior marketing skills please.

I have to take the benefit of the doubt of Purse.io here.  They are a business.. with a whole bunch more to lose than 224 mbtc.  It sounds like the most obvious reason for the movement of your coins. I don't understand why purse would selectively chose your account to take a few bucks, and why they wouldn't take a larger amount or just go under if they were in trouble.    
I just think something is fishy and you are throwing the business under the bus with what proof other then a "i doubt that". Coins are gone, someone took them, probably not to the business who will gain a lot more by not stealing 50$ from select customers. Move on, unless you can confirm that purse.io robbed your remaining balance, you should try to get proof before throwing yet another brand that supports bitcoin under the bus with no proof.  What is the most plausible situation here, most likely your wallet comprimised, not 100%, but probably... Now if purse was in the middle of a scam, why would they focus on your 50 bucks, nobody/no amount anywhere else.... Are you 100% sure Purse.io stole your money from your wallet, or did your money go missing and you have a hunch, but are not sure where it is?   These threads can wreck a brand, people need to think twice before trying to go front page with a "maybe" acquisition about a brand who from what i have sees is doing a good job supporting the bitcoin shopping movement.

I decided to split between multiple pages because I thought it became a little redundant and over welming with one long page of listings, perhaps it would be better if I increased the number per page?  Would love your feedback. Thanks
@_date: 2015-02-09 06:23:56
Hey thanks a lot for the feedback....
Might be the dumb Q of the day, what is a remittance service?  
Mycelium, adding right now.   
I agree about the bank account will ponder and come up with a better more descriptive title.  
And will def work on the padding, thanks for that, it's always good to hear how other browsers render!

Hey thanks so much for submitting this.  Are you getting this all the time, or is it showing up after staying around for a bit?  This is a bug that I have been having a hard time with, it seems to appear once in a while, not all the time.  Thanks again for letting me know, will be working on fixing this.  We have you guys listed by the way, love the exchange, very clean =) 300 bits

Has anyone confirmed this through a news source or booking documents?  Are they arrested on criminal charges, or were they taken in for questioning?  If they have been charged, are they civil proceedings that led to other charges, are they fraud for falsifying names/documents, or are they federal charges brought by the UK?  Has anyone from any of the communities been questioned? Anyone in any of the chats or who interacted with them daily? Lots unanswered can't seem to find any public sources to confirm anything, surely there is some verified record?

To be completely honest, the number of scams in this community, anyone, who is an owner, operator, or involved with an exchnage that has lost a significant amount of coins, cannot be trusted. Yes I said it. Put your money in places that haven't seen scandals or scams.  Consider using businesses that are not operated by people with a shady past, or shady involvements, regardless of the level of their involvement, why the hell would you risk it? Convenience? Really?  Trust your hard earned money in a complete strangers pocket, who has a potential shady BG in this neighborhood.  The risk is up to you, so is your financial security.

Hey and for the record, make sure to get them off the exchange after you purchase them and store them on physical storage with multi sig that is password protected. Can never be too safe with large amounts.

Customer support is great he says. The same guy who will be starting a bitcointalk "support" thread for getting scammed in a few weeks.  With all he theft and fraud in here, why would anyone trust a business under the same management which previously a) lost millions b) judging by the btctalk thread, wrapped up with some less then positive influences who apparently stole everything (if the story checks out)     
Why are they trustworthy after losing so many funds previously regardless of who stole them?  So, you would prefer an untrustworthy, innovative company, for storing minimal amounts of coins, in which you are going to stay with Coin Jar. Ever considered a law abiding company that hasnt lost millions managed by a successful entreprenuer in which you can trust keeping lots of currency? Probably not, people like you are the reasons scam thrive in here and i really hope you get cleaned out completely soon enough to stop leaving your dumbass input in here and encouraging people to stick with SHADY business run by people with 0 applicable knowledge to facilitating financial transactions.  People like you need  to learn to GOOGLE, stop trusting strangers with your currency and stop being the pimple of Bitcoin.  
More research, more due diligence, less dumb asses feeding scams and complaining about it.

You can't describe the first aspect of their marketing plan, just wondering where your merrets for doing a better job come from?  Where is your business? What bitcoin companies' strategy have you influenced for comparative sales or expansion?   You take a brand that is killing it in the bitcoin space, and rip their marketing plan for not forking out dollars on mainstream media?.... Doesn't make too much sense..  But alright.

Hey you!  Please don't give up! It can be tough your first time, but once you find the perfect place it's a breeze afterwords.  Here's a list of exchanges that let you use NZD -

As a core function, of value exchange (yes I understand the technology exceeds beyond),  I think this is why Bitcoin is described and approached in this method.    Yes, you do hear negative things, but you also used to hear alot more.  If you open your eyes, the negative news recently has been quite saturated with positive movements and motivations behind Bitcoin.     
My opinion is that yes, the value of bitcoin far exceeds value exchange into other avenues.  As for the realization of these technologies, I think people will warm up to the further potential of bitcoin when it has been further adopted in to th mainstream, meaning the general public has a better grasp of how to use it for value exchange.    
   
Yes, bitcoin is capable of many things, many things that you cannot walk up to just anyone, and explain in 5 minutes.  Bitcoin can only mature as fast as it's adoption rates and the general understanding..... skipping the step of it's core functions to focus on other, more niche and advanced avenues... I am not sure, personally in my opinion, it is skipping a step.    
      
   
I did notice your reply to my first comment leaves out any mentions of "The UltraCoin Wallet", ad you did in your title, yet the article is pretty much an advertisement for it...
@_date: 2015-02-25 03:46:19
Watch it for the next few hours and see if you can't get get a little discount.  On the large purchase make sure you goto a service that charges minimal fees as some of the quick purchase alternatives charge a premium for the quick sale, or might hold your funds for questioning as seen in a few posts today.  Here's a whole bunch of alternatives  I believe Coin Spot is the company that I remember is focusing on AUD!  Best of luck with the purchase, recommend sticking with bitcoin and not investing so much in to an alt until there is a little more stability behind them.  Bitcoin has the global utility backing it and that is hard to pass up.  Have fun friend, enjoy the world of bitcoin mate!

I am the last person to ask anything technical, sorry friend... The best thing I can recommend for the future is that you take your coins off services before you hit the sack for the night.  I know it's greasy and kind of an inconvenience sometimes, but it's really the only way to avoid this... My comment soley comes from putting myself in the shoes of whoever owns Purse.io and the negative lashback from random 50$ going missing, can't see it. That being said, can't confirm it didn't happen either, just my opinion.   Really sorry this happened to you, it always sucks when you know your personal account has been compromised, lost a wallet last month in same way to a different service.  Keep your head up and good luck with your investigation 500 bits.

"PURCHASE WITH CONFIDENCE"     
+ bitcoin
@_date: 2015-02-07 20:58:47
I love this idea!
@_date: 2015-02-06 17:30:12
No longer? I have been with them (Canadian) since day 1 when they gave out 10$ free.  Always been able to deposit with Debit/Credit, never been able to withdraw, whch I don't mind use another service for this.  Still have instant access to Bitcoin anytime of the day from outside the US.
@_date: 2015-02-16 00:36:32
Awesome!  
edit: this is actually really inspiring to do in my home town.  It's cool to see the process. If anyone else is doing these definitely share them!   
@_date: 2015-02-26 15:15:34
Launching an exchange was pretty good marketing for the other services, considering it reaches all the consumer Bitpay does not.  Sure they could, who is going to pay for it?  I would imagine the advertising they are investing in is probably targeted ad's aimed at people who are not in here already, so maybe they are running. you just dont see them.  They have earned your loyalty without television ads thus far =)
@_date: 2015-02-28 18:59:31
Because they can, what is your point? They have lower manufacturing costs than us, less overhead, decreased labor rates, it happens in every industry because it is a profitable opportunity.  If you are suggesting this as evidence to support your racist mentality, it's not.  Go dig a hole, and jump in it.
@_date: 2015-02-24 00:45:16
I would snap at the opportunity to have a baked conversation with the head of the bank and coinbase.
@_date: 2015-02-09 16:24:48
We offer lots of services that are quite unique, and a wide variety of listings in a number of areas...  thanks for the positive point of view, feel free to suggest some services we are missing, although approaching 80, i think pretty happy with our turn out thus far.
@_date: 2015-02-28 01:49:22
Common sense would tell me something is fishy.    
Does anyone actually believe  this statement would represent the current consumer population... Consider your social circle. If US consumers felt bitcoin was more secure than mobile payments, why are more US consumers not using bitcoin over traditional mobile payments?  
@_date: 2015-02-09 16:25:07
300 thanks a bunch for the suggestion will get it up!
@_date: 2015-02-16 23:22:35
That would be very expensive =)
@_date: 2015-02-28 01:43:48
I think it'd be a big group of us haha
@_date: 2015-02-25 03:55:20
Haha sorry, there is definitely a whole bunch of choices.  I think the best for fees in your case would either be Local Bitcoins if there are active sellers in your area or Coin Spot as they deal directly in AUD and have some GST savings... Can't recall any other AUD off hand but i am sure there are some, will take a peak and let you know if i find any

Nothing?  You would argue, when Facebook accepts Bitcoin, that none of their customers will consider adopting it?  I would state the complete opposite.  Merchants accepting Bitcoin does ***something*** to the supply and demand of Bitcoin.   Your view suggests when a merchant starts accepting Bitcoin, this has 0 influence on their customers consideration. ***Nahhhht the case***. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 16:50:09
Ah yes. They're, their, and there, a true puzzle.

Hey! Before you do anything make sure you line up solid cold storage.  Super important that you don't keep coins in exchange wallets for long periods of time. When you have coins in a services wallet, you are putting security in their hands, better off keeping it in your pocket =)  Just use exchanges for temp purposes and do a few googles before depositing anywhere to see if there is any discussion from previous users.  
  
These are very vague &amp; basic because I haven't had time to update them but they might be kind of useful 
   
How to buy bitcoin  -   
Basic wallets 101 -    
What is bitcoin -    
Why use bitcoin -      
   
Key terms - Multi sig &amp; password protected... Physical storage with private keys generated offline is definitely a plus, and personal wallets (not a service or web wallet)
Edit: Just toss me a message if you ever have questions and I'll do my best to give you an answer.  Your best friend in this place is news &amp; research, just let me know!
