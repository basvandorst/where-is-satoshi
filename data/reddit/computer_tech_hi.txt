Welcome to reddit.
@_date: 2014-09-17 22:28:43
i got my invite yesterday they gave me 10 dollars when i opened the account. i added 10 more dollars using my debit card and took like 2 mins to get my coins. 
@_date: 2014-11-02 16:31:23
I think I'm the one who sent you that.

 130 BTC that's about 16,000USD right ? 
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:41:36
alright it must be blockchain. I guess it's  time for me to get a new wallet elsewhere. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:42:43
this is why i love Reddit. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:17:02
Since you set the payout to 0.05 you need 0.05. You gotta long way to go. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:21:16
i will pay it forward once I'm rich again... 
@_date: 2013-11-07 02:18:33
I was about to make an account with them. Glad I did not.
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:10:24
wow today is my lucky day! thanks @_date: 2013-11-21 19:23:08
0.01 btc fee or $?
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:40:57
there are tons of btc gambling sites out there. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 03:21:41
Well it not like i have much BTC anyway. i have like 0.005 BTC 
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:29:55
that's just the fee not your whole transaction right? 
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:41:27
i figured it out. wow i knew spending 24/7 on this site would pay off kinda. This is better than Reddit gold. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:28:30
what just happened? 
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:11:59
Because you don't have enough for the payout.
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:30:31
Better order your CPU too.. That will be burnt up just for mining fractions of pennies.
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:13:03
it's crazy! I'm excited!! Thanks random redditors !
@_date: 2013-11-07 08:02:45

@_date: 2013-11-21 19:37:50

@_date: 2013-11-10 00:32:19
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:04:16
well i moved 90% of my coins to litecoin. i bought them when they were about 12 bucks a piece about two days ago. now they are shy of 50 bucks. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 07:06:42
wal*mart does not have drive-thru and does not stop people from not wearing pants.. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:58:04
For mining ? Can't really make coin mining with your CPU.
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:00:33
now my $1.75 in coins worth $2.02 yay! 
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:24:23
yes, I just even did a custom transaction to put higher fee in it. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:40:02
wow thanks ! made my ~~day~~ week. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:33:45
