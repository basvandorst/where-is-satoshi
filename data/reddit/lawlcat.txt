I always hated this. Sure, he spent 10,000 bitcoins then for pizzas, but... lets say he didn't spend his 10k bitcoins and just gave $41 USD.
He could have easily just used his $41 to buy 10,000 bitcoins and you could say the same thing.
I bought a pizza in 2009, probably spent about $10 on it. Had I spent that $10 on bitcoin instead I would have had 2400 coins or 36 million today.

I dont use the app so I couldn't help you with that, but on the website when you go to sell, you can [select the place to deposit]( and just change from your bank account to USD Wallet.
EDIT: Just checked the app, there is a drop down arrow next to Deposit To and you can change it to USD Wallet

Tried some super small day trading and every time I would just lose little bits of money here and there. When this crash was going on I decided "No. Do the opposite of what you feel this time."
So I bought in some btc at $11,998 and some IOTA at $3.03.  Pretty happy with how it's gone now :D

I probably would have covered that over better than a few little reversible scribbles..

Sales on GDAX and Coinbase go into your GDAX/Coinbase USD wallet. You can then withdraw to your bank account after the fact, or leave it in and use the USD to buy more

When I was in school years ago, I had a classmate who was just getting into bitcoin. It was priced like $250ish or so? And I laughed at him, telling him what a stupid idea bitcoin is and the whole cryptocurrency was just some bullshit ponzi scheme.
Then it went up to like $1200 and he kept on and I laughed at him, sayin it was gonna pop and he would lose a ton of money. 
It eventually did, I think and dropped down to what, like 600? I ended up buying like $300 in ships in Star Citizen instead of buying half a bitcoin.
Boy don't I have egg on my face now
