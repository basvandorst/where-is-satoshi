The thing is, services are pulling back from accepting Bitcoin, not moving towards it. Just this week, for example, Steam no longer accepts Bitcoin. Transaction costs, slow transactions, and a stupid amount of volatility means that actually selling anything in Bitcoin just doesn't make sense. There are fundamental problems with Bitcoin that make accepting it a bad business decision, and nothings going to change that in the near future. There might be a cryptocurrency that solves Bitcoin's problems and gets widespread acceptance some time in the future, but that cryptocurrency isn't going to be Bitcoin.

For someone who's well versed in economics, they have enough knowledge bouncing around their brain to throw it out reasonably coherently without an outline. I'm by no means a historian, just someone who's interested in German history, but I knew enough to write an answer in on German unification basically off the top of my head. There was some double checking with some books that I've got lying around, and a couple specific quotes that I wanted to dig up, but I had a general direction in mind from the moment I saw the prompt. It take time, no doubt, but it's not hard if the topic is already a significant part of your life.

The fact that it hasn't crashed in 8 years doesn't mean that it won't in the 9th. Bitcoin sucks as a currency, and right now the only reason that people want it is because it keeps going up in value. Literally no one buys Bitcoin right now without the intent to turn it back into fiat at some point down the line. It's like gold, but at least if gold were to crash you could use it in computers.

The world ran on mercantilism for a long time, too. Doesn't make it a good economic system.

It really sucks if you're the one who owes the debt, because your debt just keeps getting harder and harder to pay off.
