Doubling or quadrupling doesn't solve anything but adds more moving parts. A hardfork, takes away development resources &amp; time, risks centralization, and we're still pissing in the ocean. SegWit still hasn't been implemented in most wallets, miners still mine empty blocks using covert ASICBoost, and those complaining about fees are spamming the network with junk tx's. If people were serious about scaling vs centralizing SegWit would have been adopted as fast as the big blockers pushed thru a failed SegWit2x H.F

When you sell your country out to global enelected government, it's very enticing to do so. See TPP, NAFTA, GAT, Paris Accord. These are meant to de-industrialize the US and send the jobs to sweatshops.

Jamie feeling the heat. No doubt he'll be at Bilderberg scheming to subvert BTC by hook or crook. Bribing more government officials to come down on exchanges or something to that effect. It'll be a self fulfilling prophecy and then he'll say but I believe in this shitcoin my China friends made, and here are their good friends John McCuckFee and Roger Judas Ver to tell you all about it.

 Next he'll say he made fun of a handicapped reporter
 Trump removed the MLK bust from the oval office
 Trump called a slain soldier's widow and shat on her life and hung up
 All  claims that all had to be retracted. These people are so intellectually dishonest or just liars. The same ones that lied about Iraq WMD's, 9/11, Hands Up Don't Shoot, RussiaHoax, Trump had 2.33% chance to win.
