I'm a Chinese bitcoin investor myself and I would hate to see bitcoin turned into Chinacoin after this fork. Decentralization is the core value of bitcoin and without it , the data means nothing. I can tell you even the Chinese will start dumping their stash because there's no point to have another currency regulated by the Central bank. Only time will tell if Jihan Wu really try to end the blocksize debate or he just want to further his own agendas.

I wish someone can give you a definite answer. I'm not an advisor so don't take my words too serious.
I don't know your financial situation. I hold 40 bitcoins myself and I don't plan on selling ever because the maximum lost for me is a bit over $20000 since i bough them at 500$ a piece. If you got them for 300$ each there's no real reason to panic sell like other people unless you need cash to support your daily needs. Bitcoin isn't going to die as long as people are using for barter goods otherwise they cannot get with fiat. The bigger question is can you afford to lose all the money you invested into bitcoin.

If your blockchain.info wallet was created with the 12 words seed then you are fine... even if they suspend withdraw on their website. You can derive the public/private key with BIP39 mnemonic and use those on two different clients.
However if your wallet isn't backed up by the seed phrase then you will need to get the individual public/private keys and sweep them in offline wallet...

Are you talking about ACH credit, ACH debit or Wire?... in the US they are all bank transfers.  Ach credit if you intitial before the bank cut off will be posted in the receiver account the next business day between 12am to 7am. Wire usually within minutes to hours .. so wire usually faster because Ach payment goes through a federal clearance house first in batches.

If you are not buying or selling I'm not sure why you want to use coinbase as a wallet. It's an exchange not a wallet service . Just download electrum on your computer and save the seeds then call it a day. If you prefer an online wallet blockchain.info is good enough.

If you stop payment on a ACH debit that you authorized, coinbase will stuck with a ACH return fee from their payment processor and they will block your account.

I'm not sure what you mean. If you want to accept bitcoin on your website you can easily set it up to accept bitcoins with some integration...

Top message:
After a little while, when they think through it, this agreement will be just like similar documents we signed with other exchanges, they will discard sooner or later. The smart exchanges did not sign their names. The way these idiots set things up, will confuse the fuck out of them when the fork occurs. Bottom message: Obviously, only the second tier exchanges signed the document, They thought they are smart, in fact they don't even know how to deal with basic details and logics, there are more complication will arise in the event of a hard fork, but the concepts are simple. The big blocks will take over the small ones.

If your bitcoins are staying in a hardware wallet you will be fine... just wait until the storm is over.
You shouldn't leave anything in an exchange because you will most likely wont have access to the duplicate BTU coins for awhile ( possibly forever)
@_date: 2017-03-13 11:15:09
If you are going to buy bitcoins with ACH, they will ask for name, dob , address and bank account login ( only like 12 major banks to select from ). 500 daily limit ( same as Gemini ) . the only different is you don't get the exchange rate until ur payment ARRIVES, and not when you place the order. which can be good or bad depends on price fluctuation. perhaps they will update their system but who knows.
ACH debit processed by Synapsepay ( there was a message saying documentation maybe required )
Placed a small order yesterday. no SSN or ID request yet, but we know well enough anything involve the ACH network gets regulated at one point or another... 
coinbase is overwhelmed atm. support tickets takes a whole week to answer and ID verification system is bugged. Abra seems like a good alternative since Snapcard is shutting down.

You are right I didn't take R&amp;D cost into count. If an employer can choose between hiring a bunch of h-1b visa/naïve workers in Silicon Valley, or simply hire people in China that are competent, the latter can reduce the cost to 1/3 or less.

No. As long as you extract the private and public keys from electrum, they will be the same on both chains. Then you just need to sweep them into the respective supporting clients to sign transactions

You should not have , especially before a possible chain split.
For coinbase, you do not control your private keys and hence you don't control the bitcoin on either chains. Exchanges will suspend deposit/withdraw until they figure out wtf is going. If you move them to an offline wallet lets say electrum you can obtain the public/private keys for your bitcoin. As long as you know the public/private key for your coins they will be the same for both chains and you can retrieve them later. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:16:46
Electrum may not support both chains right away, and it's risky to do anything right after the split. After the storm is over you can always download the individual supporting clients to spend the coins.

They get ur money the next business day using Ach debit, if you initial the purchase before 5pm pst. They use longer hold time to lower their exposure to Ach returns ( r10 and r7 ). If the purchase is made by a high jacked account ach transfers can be easily disputed by account owner and that's now snapcard out of business. Moreover there are people who are willing verify themselves then buy a large amount and give coinbase the middle finger. Ach system is good for bill payments  but it's not ideal for Bitcoin exchanges because buyers have 60 days to dispute the charges.
@_date: 2017-03-16 18:08:40
 I'm a little skeptical about this site because they claim to have $5000 daily Ach limits. Perhaps you can do some research. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 07:16:01
If you entered the transaction just now. ACH debit will not be processed after Friday 5PM PST, they will process the next business day which is monday. so the money won't leave your account until Tus morning. 
1: You have Tus morning to add enough money to your bank to cover the purchase
2: ACH debit from coinbase will result NSF and you will get charge of NSF fee and coinbase will either block your account or cancel the trade.
If you have any other payments schedule to be taken out from your account on tus morning. Most banks will process the largest ticket items first, so if your rent amount is bigger, then the ACH debit from coinbase and your other small payments will be returned. A better question is did you pay your rent/bills with checks or electronic debit?

I used CEX.io a long time ago and they gave me $1000 daily cc limit after verification.  I'm not sure where you're from so you may end up with a different limit.
Alternative with the ACH system, if you live in US i would recommend Abra since it takes 1 business day to deposit money into ur USD wallet from bank account then you can exchange the amount for only 1% conversion fee. Coinbase takes a whole fucking week for bank transfers ( 1.49% fees ) when they are using next day ACH settlement system. Gemini let's you trade right away with the deposit funds for 0.25% fees but you cannot withdraw until 3-4 business days later.
PS: RIP snapcard
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:46:48
coinbase already said move ur stuffs off their website. Before the split, if you move them to an offline wallet, you can retrieve the privatekey/public key for the addresses with bitcoins. After the split , and wait until the networks becomes stable, with the private and public key,  then you just signal the bitcoin transaction with different supporting bitcoin clients then transfer/sell it off to different interest party. 
Your bitcoins in one of the chain may become worthless and possibly the combined value will be lowered as well.

fuck coinbase. On buy orders they charge 5$ more than listing price + 1.49% fees on top. A purchase of 800 ended up with with a total of 817.92 ( close to 2% fee ).
not to mention they now make you wait 8-9 days if you paid with a bank account.
Gemini gives you whatever price you paid for with 0.25% fee and you can resell your bitcoin without wait time.
Abra charge flat 1% for withdraw and ach deposit is next day for me ( not sure about your bank )
both are better options than coinbase
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:56:18
I think you have to pray the fork doesn't occur before your transaction clears ( 99% chance won't within a week ) because coinbase will suspend withdraw for awhile until they figure out wtf is going on.
As soon as they release your order you should transfer to a wallet and extract the private and public keys, since they will be the same in both chains and you can later sweep them to a supporting client.
@_date: 2017-03-15 11:11:31
I have to assume for normal users it's no different than trading with people in localbitcoins unless Abra actually runs background check for the tellers.
Also according to fincen there's a $1000 daily requirement for someone qualify as a money service business and it's sort of a grey area if people stay below dealing $10000 a day total, and less than $1000 per person.
Since I do run a donutshop with my wife so I'm actually interested about this idea as well.
our main cash inflow is from the shop itself so it's actually better to handle less cash if people want to withdraw cash in exchange of bitcoins. I don't really like the weird look from some of the boa employee when I bring in lots of 1s/5s 
I do understand Abra wants be the Uber for remittance, but Uber also currently has over 100 lawsuits for circumventing the regulations. I'm just curious will you guys have similar program to protect tellers like this one 
@_date: 2017-03-18 05:14:19

Use Gemini, they let you buy/sell bitcoins right away before your bank deposits clears. Although you won't be able to withdraw your bitcoins until funds are clear.
Also fees are 0.25% incomparison to 1.49% with coinbase.

I wish someone can give you a definite answer...
At the beginning the split (t=0) Same price as BTC 
And no exchanges on earth will let you sell or convert BTU to anything right away.
If you know for certain BTC will be one taking over You can always try dump the BTU to the BTU supporters for cash payment or any electronic payments as soon as possible before it crashes.
PS: Don't take any payment that's reversible or they will feel like an idiot soon enough and chargeback on you.

Moreover sellers in China don't have strict regulations unlike fincen in US where you are required to register as a MSB for trading.

eh I'm not sure how indepth you want to go. Before the split, if you move them to an offline wallet lets say Electrum, you can retrieve the privatekey/public key for the addresses with bitcoins, alternatively just remember the 12 words backup phrase for the wallet. After the split , with the private and public key, ( note you may not be able to use electrum client unless they make it competitible with BTU you may need derive the public/private key with BIP39 mnemonic  then you just signal the bitcoin transaction with different supporting bitcoin clients then transfer it off to different interest party. you won't be able to sell or trade BTU duplicate it through an exchange for a while ( possibly forever ), perhaps in a cash trade for whatever price people willing to pay for BTU, for BTC you can expect to trade it through an exchange some point down the road, but if you want to sell it in a hurry you can do cash trade or sell it through other electronic payments methods. just make sure there's no buyers remorse and ur seller chargeback on you for buying some useless BTU coins.

@_date: 2017-03-18 13:28:06
Keep in mind this is purely my own opinions.
1: You get 1 Bitcoin on both chains - you should not leave it in an exchange or online wallet since you do not control your private keys and hence you don't control the bitcoin on either chains. Exchanges will suspend deposit/withdraw until they figure out wtf is going.  As long as you know the public/private key for your coins they will be the same for both chains and you can retrieve them later.
2: If you plan to sell at a big dip , most exchanges will give you the middle finger message when you submit your sell order until it stablize to prevent losses on their end. I'd recommend set a price threshold instead of waiting for a catastrophic moment. Why not use bitstamp over kraken? kraken based in US and their compliance team are not very euro friendly.
@_date: 2017-03-22 09:10:10
Who doesn't hate the IRS? Most people chose to underreport their income because the audit rate is less than 1%. We are taking about 850 filers each year vs over 1 million US users from coinbase, and that's what caught Uncle sams attention since he's not getting his cut. John Doe summons usually work out really well for IRS and it's difficult to contest because the laws always side with tax regulators. This incident should teach people not to use centralize exchanges.
@_date: 2017-03-22 03:21:43

From what I understands snapcard closed due to excessive chargebacks and low sales volume. They are now focus on their remittance service and will only accept wire transfers from old buyers. the sad true is any random person can get fully verified and don't give a fuck and dispute all the payments. most exchanges nowaday have really low daily Ach limits to prevent losses.  So wire transfer or cash trades will be your your only options if you plan to buy large amounts without coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 04:28:19

I second that.  If you want to run a successful business in China, particularly Beijin, you may end up sucking the corrupted officials. ( why you think Xi Jinping focused on anti corruption ).

Good timing to try out Abra since Snapcard is shutting down next week , and Celery is jacking their rate to 10%. also I don't want to use coinbase.
500$ daily deposit limit is good because they can prevent fraud and money laundering with their service, which is important for the platform.
I registered an account earlier and added some money and so far all they asked was my name , address and bank account login to start buying bitcoins. The bitcoin wallet can be backed up with a seed phrase. 
I notice they are using Abra tellers to exclude themselves as MSB. I think if this business grows it will draw a lot scrutiny from local law enforcement and we can bet the regulator will start jumping in. 
My concern is that sooner or later, after all the regulations kick in, they will become the next coinbase/gemini that  require users to submit personal info in the future like picture holding selfies and SSN, then people will prefer alternative like localbitcoins instead.
( perhaps someone from abra can clarify more on this )

It's possible bfx doing it just to show they have "liqudity" before an exit scam since we don't have that many traders in TW... 
Especially with the banking reforms right now in TW, the money flow makes it look suspicous on personal bank accounts with all the foreign and domestic wires. 
Perhaps a higher premium will encourage people to take the risk, but until then 10% isn't worth it for large amounts imo.

This arb opportunity is only for very selective people. 1: Taiwan resident. 2. Enough disposable cash. 3. Enough balls to risk their funds and bank account. And even though I dumped 20k on my most recent cycle I don't see myself going beyond that since greed is a bitch. Bfx can suspend domestic xfer anytime they want and disappear with my deposits.  Also if you do more than 100k at a time as an individual you will gain scrutiny from your bank without a doubt. You also have to think about the amount in 新台币 and not usd. I don't think the gap will be close unless institutional investors jump in . since we have a small bitcoin population in Taiwan.

Most startups tend to lose money until they recover their capital investments until some point down the line ( or lose all together) . If investors expect immediate returns they shouldn't be looking at funding rounds.
