Disagree. People aren't that rational. They just see the large price and that psychologically puts them off. Exactly the same phenomenon happens on the stock market, which is why companies perform stock splits:

OP, just google Dan Evans Bitcoin. Look at the first hit. LinkedIn profile. Mentions twins and Bitcoin. This is how they got the info. 
As others have recommended, try not to use your real name on sites associated with Bitcoin or as the value increases, you will become more of a target.

"When the people of the world have a common monetary language, completely freed from every government, it will so facilitate and stabilize exchange that peace and prosperity will ensue even without world government. With the state denied its money diluting power, the ills that lead to strife and war will be removed. A union of peoples rather than a union of political governments is what this world needs"

Oh nice...I thought N26 charge you a fee for transfers? Do you know if they mark up the exchange rate at all?

"You tried to short Bitcoin or call the top of the market? Don't any of you do that again. I will shut that shit down, no exceptions."

Reuters also covering this story: 
"Users will now be able to hold, exchange, spend and transfer bitcoin the same way they use other currencies"

I think now that Revolut have added personal IBANs for the EUR pocket that would work but I've not tried it yet. Probably best try with a small amount first. 
@_date: 2017-07-11 16:34:58
Yes that's right. On Revolut, go to More &gt; Profile &gt; Account Details &gt; Euro . As of the latest update you will have a personal Revolut EUR account with a unique BIC / IBAN. So you should add those details to Fire for withdrawal

It sounds like you will be able to from the article:
"Users will now be able to hold, exchange, spend and transfer bitcoin the same way they use other currencies" - currently you can trade between pocket currencies in Revolut - so it sounds like you will be able to use it for crypto trading also once they add Bitcoin as a pocket currency.

Fire charge you a big fee to convert from GBP to EUR and you get a bad exchange rate. With Revolut you get interbank rate and no fees. Saves you about 3% or more

As some others have mentioned the best quick UK option right now is bank transfer through localbitcoins.com. Bittylicious works in a similar fashion but is usually more pricey. 
When you initiate a trade on localbitcoins.com your coins are automatically put into escrow by the site, and released when the seller receives your payment. It's never taken me longer than 10 mins to get coins

Another option is to sign up to virwox.com. You don't need to upload registration documents. You then buy Linden dollars using PayPal and then use these to buy BTC. 
There is a 2.5% transaction fee for each conversion and you'll be paying over the odds, but it is quick and painless.
You can then withdraw your BTC to your wallet. For your first withdrawal your coins will be held for 48 hours but after that it's instant.

By comparing bitcoin to the Zimbabwean dollar the author of this article clearly demonstrates his complete lack of understanding of bitcoin. 
Zimbabwean hyperinflation was caused by the government printing excessive amounts of money - this can't happen with bitcoin

Just a theory, but I think that when Virgin Money release their current account products, they will be BTC friendly. 
Branson has already announced that Virgin Galactic now accept BTC payments, and I believe the Virgin brand would be tainted by supporting BTC payments in 'Galactic' but not being BTC friendly in 'Money'. 
If his bank are the first bank to really be pro BTC, he will not only gain massive press coverage, but he will gain lots of customers who are experiencing lots of problems with their own bank's attitudes towards BTC currently, and are looking for another solution. Win-win.
And once one bank embraces BTC, the rest will have to follow suit if they wish to remain competitive. In this scenario, as public awareness and demand for BTC increases, so will the pressure on banks to be BTC friendly, whether they like it or not.
Also, Branson is a Libertarian, and I believe BTC is very appealing to this philosophy.
