You'll probably need to contact the wallet or exchange and get them to reset your security on your account. I've done this in the past and they'll need to see proof of ID and will probably call you too before they reset it

I'm unsure how simple it is to do but you can use those passwords on another wallet in most situations. I think you need a tool to assist with it. search BIP39 protocol, something to do with that.
Use Loaf wallet for Litecoin, not sure about Eth. It is better to not put all your eggs in one basket so multiple wallets is a good option. Then look at paper wallets and hardware wallets

What’s to say he/she/they didn’t cash out when they dropped off the grid?

They are dodgy and their support is shite. They will issue warning saying do not use the Mac app but at the same time they do not remove the download feature to it from their site. Recovering your wallet is simply but it is simply for every wallet, you use the recover passwords they provide you.
For iOS, unless you are trading stay away from Jaxx. You'll have constant issues with your values not displaying and support teams telling you to clear the cache on your app. (What other app support on the most advance phone in the world has the user clear cache?) Them and Kraken are a disgrace when it comes to iOS and frankly Apple should pull them as they do not meet a minimum user experience standard. If you only have bitcoin and want to use a wallet, use Bread.

Very US centric point of view.

You need to be careful with your privacy. Don’t show your balance and your carrier and have a user name which is probably your real name. Someone could make some easy social engineering and get into your accounts with that as a minimum.

If we have to rely on one man to fight for Bitcoin then it is time to cash out. Andreas should not be idolised, no one should be put on a pedestal to speak for bitcoin.

If you've only just got in because of that shite show you would still be getting your account approved by the exchanges.

Make a police report. It is stolen property.
Does your phone have tracking on it? 
What phone doesn't have a password these days? I thought it was mandatory on all smart phones?

You will end-up being out of pocket a few hundred dollars for some imaginary fees which you will need to send via a western union money order (anyone with the details can cash them).
Look up 419 scam. It is always the same process just different reason why you need to pay real $$.
Stop talking to them and leave it alone, don't share any more of you personal details to the person and don't provoke them. Report it to the police, it is a crime.

You don't have to buy a whole coin. Invest what ever you can reasonable afford to loose. 
@_date: 2019-06-23 03:51:00
Use CoinCap to track performance based on a specific unit but you can’t move someone else’s wallet to yours, that would be stealing.
@_date: 2019-06-23 03:28:28
If it was stolen, how could you possibly known it was used for bitcoin and then also know it was put in a wallet with her name? Why even go to the trouble of using her name?
If it’s stolen from her bank account tell your bank about it. 
Make a police report
However I think you are jumping to conclusions about Bitcoin and the wallet based on what you’ve explained.

i'm willing to bet everyone loses all their $$ in this ep, not that I would ever watch it anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:08:32
So you meant to say "buy it, hodl it, secure it"
Take it off the market has a different connotation to me and would infer removing the coins from circulation completely, i.e. making them worthless. 
@_date: 2019-12-22 05:19:03
There is no single price in fiat for BTC, each exchange has different prices and it can vary hugely in different countries too.

Depends if they stated that they support it or not. Keep in mind that some of these forks aren’t exactly stable or secure and need a fair amount of dev work to support them, that takes time. No it’s not legally binding that they must payout in most cases.

If you are not spending the coins then you only need a paper wallet (and a secure place to keep it). You only need a hardware wallet if you are making purchases

I'm pretty sure that running a site that enables kiddy porn and drug sales plus putting hits out on people all have something to do with it.

A) stop talking like a little school girl
B) put your BTC coins in a wallet you hold the keys too
C) no one knows yet so wait until the HF happens and then wait a week before there is a solution. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 01:21:40
and 8 days later we discover that Bitfinex is closing all US customer accounts...hence this is why you never leave coins on an exchange if you are not trading them.

This reinforces my belief he is Satoshi, but more so, why do we even give a toss if he is or isn't? The whole point of inventing it was about privacy and anonymity which is entirely in character with Craig Wright and everyone is trying to take that way from him. Sure he is a hot head who loves dropping an f bomb but he has a good reason to, he is constantly hounded about this wherever he goes. People that fascinate over who Satoshi was/is are not getting what Bitcoin is about and are distracted by the myth.
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:27:10
So why do they have exchanges that allow day trading? There is literally nothing where I live that I can buy with bitcoin

On linked Apple devices you can simply copy on your phone then immediately paste on your Mac. 
There are so many google options (use 2fa and use encryption on your phone and pc), just copy into a google sheet, doc, draft email, and open it on you pc,

It is recommended that you put coins into a wallet that you hold the keys to, that normally means do not keep them on an exchange, in fact you should practice that as standard anyway.
As the fork nears stop doing any transactions and sit tight. 
After the fork happens you very well might not be able to do anything, with regards to seeing and using these new coins for at least a week as the wallet guys need to build a way to export your coins. I think it took Bread 2-3 weeks last time? During this time you can buy more Bitcoin but probably no exchange will yet be supporting B2X or what ever it is (it needs to be built and tested).  
During this period keep an eye on reddit and twitter for trusted people to advise the process to get to your coins safely. 
You are going to see lots of messages from people threatening class action suits to the exchanges because they can't access their new coins, ignore them and wait.

Gavin Andresen still trusts that Craig is Satoshi even after the controversy surrounding the signing of the key in front of him ...Do we not trust Gavin?

Does this assume that the US/AUD exchange doesn't change until then? 
Also, what is a "bit"?
@_date: 2017-10-11 01:17:59
it's going to dip because of fears about the Russian report about banning exchanges (the reports might be true or not, doesn't matter this market is so scared that people sell when someone sneezes) .
@_date: 2017-10-16 05:51:13
Don't understand your reasoning? 
If you just hold you'll be rewarded with coins in the new fork. You can then sell that or keep it but either way you literally got money for doing nothing. I wouldn't recommend anyone to sell BTC before a HF
@_date: 2017-10-11 02:01:08
i hope so.
I really just wanted to add a counter to the other post because it really is a sill question to be asking in this sub reddit
@_date: 2017-10-19 02:09:42
Yes you are freaking out, No you do not need one before a fork. 
If you're not buying things with coins I would argue you do not even need one at all. Just use a paperwallet and a trusted app wallet (Bread) with proper security precautions.  
@_date: 2017-10-10 05:54:27
Before, you'll get free coins when the fork happens and going from the last fork the price continue to rise after it happened.
