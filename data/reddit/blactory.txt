On a positive note, kids being out means you shouldn’t be pay check to pay check anymore.  If you are, you need to seriously analyze your spending habits.  Having more money won’t help anything if you are going to spend it frivolously.

Although people say yes, that notion is absurd.  If it were true, an individual or malevolent group could fork BTC repeatedly on December 31, incurring a huge tax liability on all holders that may even outweigh their holdings value.

I know exactly what you mean and agree.  "Cold storage" implies that there is something removed and stored away... people tend to think it is the actual coin... which it is not.  It's like you say, the access key.  It's confusing for people who are new or trying to wrap their mind around it because they associate the words with their true meaning and think of money as being physical.  I don't think it matters what makes sense at this point though.  It's all a magic show and the end result is all that matters.  Most of the terms may not be true representations of the process, but they do a decent job of conveying what the expected result should be.

I think a great place to start is with Coinbase.  It's attractive because it is simple.  It could be improved upon by adding popular wallet features like QR creation, which will allow for easy transfers when shopping.  For some reason people have issues trading fiat-&gt;BTC and back.  Coinbase is FDIC insured, so why not turn the "USD wallet" into a checking account and issue a debit card for it? You could even have auto transfer funds from a designated BTC wallet as an option so you are indirectly spending your BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:20:55

I would be happy with myself if I had 100.  I'd think I had a lot  (Currently)
@_date: 2017-08-07 17:27:43
Presently, I only own BTC, Bitcoin cash (by default), and ether.  I have capitalized on opportunities in the past, which are typically announcements of some sort, such as litecoin adding segwit or antshares being rebranded.  I sold litecoin at about 49 so I kinda lucked out, and although I could have made more money on ANS if I held longer (NEO is doing great right now), it wasn't part of the plan, so I cashed it out and put the earnings right back into BTC. 
Side note, ANS is positioned to do well, I just don't believe in their mission statement and the fact that they have so few developers is really unattractive.  My plan was to make a quick buck and I did! The point is, stick to your plan.
@_date: 2017-08-29 23:03:30
Classic!! Years ago I never imagined that the world would be evolving to accept crypto to quickly.  
@_date: 2017-08-14 05:56:39
Additionally, a point that has been popping up lately is the infrastructure that Bitcoin has.  Infrastructure=value.  The amount spent to create the coin alone makes people value it more than 25 cents.  Bitcoin has an advantage over some comparable altcoins because of the infrastructure and branding.  Branding is POWERFUL... look at coca colas value and how overpriced their stock is, simply because of the brand they have created.  Although I think you are grossly undervaluing the utility, utility isn't the only thing that gives value.

Yes.  GDAX has an option to move Coinbase funds for free.  Once there, you can sell at a lower rate.
It's important to note that your limits may be different on GDAX than on Coinbase.  This makes no sense, but it's how they do business.

Personally, I don't need to have someone assigned to my account, I just need a response when I have an issue.  This is particularly critical when we are talking about a financial institution (they are FDIC insured!) that doesn't have branches for me to go in and have my issues resolved.  My experiences with Fidelity for example have been wonderful... any time I call I get a response right away.  They are friendly and not only resolved issues, but help me accomplish minor things and account changes over the phone (address changes and authorization to trade penny stocks for example).  Something I can compare this to would be getting your account limits changed on GDAX, which ends up being a much more difficult task than it should be.
@_date: 2017-08-30 23:09:18
Good point 
@_date: 2017-08-07 03:51:25
I have retirement accounts as my diversification.  For crypto, I take my hard gains stock approach: minimal diversification but I DO MY HOMEWORK.  I am very confident when I put my money into something and have only not seen returns once... and it was because I didn't do my homework.
Invest in a few at most that you are dedicating your money and time to, but have an amount that you are willing to give up if something juicy comes up in order to make a quick buck, with the intention of getting out in a month or less.  
That is more or less my strategy and I have done relatively spectacular. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:52:07
That is great, so we are on the same page, I just haven't purchased any yet .  Your story doesn't really connect with OP though.

Wash sale.  Since Bitcoin acts as the reserve currency for much of crypto, I think this exemption would apply to a significant number of transactions.
@_date: 2017-08-30 22:32:09
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:13:05
I don't think this answers your question, but customer support.  I have sent in multiple tickets over months and haven't received a response.  It is absolutely absurd, particularly considering how much money I had on the account.  Banks have kissed my ass with 1/10 as much in their accounts.
The only reason to use it is simplicity IMO.  The Coinbase app is extremely user friendly so I typically recommend it for beginners, and it's easy to transition from Coinbase to GDAX when they want to step up their game. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 21:11:41

I used to just hold through it all.  You can increase your holdings significantly using the strategy you mention.  My suggestion is to do an analysis and buy back in slightly early... don’t try to time it perfect.  Also, don’t sell unless you are confident that a big dip is happening (sometimes it’s obvious).  Trying to snatch 5% here and there can be great, but it’s dangerous.

I don’t think bitcoin being risky is the point that makes his opinion shitty.  3750 isn’t a college fund.  It’s enough that it could pay off big without being a substantial loss.  That amount wouldn’t have prevented the child from going to school, which the OP stated.

I think you are too used inflationary currencies.  Bitcoin can increase in value AND be used regularly.  The “problem” currently is the wild swings.  BTC will always continue to have a smaller supply, which means that when stable, it will increase its value (Because people will always lose BTC in one way or another).

I doubt anyone could have predicted the technological advances we've made 100 years ago.  
I have no idea.
Your reasoning is way off.  You don't seem to have an understanding of how currency came to be... why people moved from barter to metals to fiat.  Competition had nothing to do with any of the transitions.  I don't think you've made a clear case why a government sponsored crypto would have any effect on something like Bitcoin.  A government sponsored "crypto" would be fiat by another name.

Accept * stuck* additionally*
Many of the exchanges that deal with fiat start with lower limits that you build up.  Why not just start building up your limits?  Open accounts on multiple exchanges (if there are multiple in Canada) which increases your buying and selling power.
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:57:15
Why don't they accept cow shit?  That also has value.  Again, you are missing the point.  
If you think the Fortune 500 businesses in the US aren't paying taxes on things they have sold for Bitcoin, or that they are accepting it because of "good feelings", you might need to dwell on this topic a little longer, or at least read statements by the execs stating why they do lol ;) 
You ARE talking about the history of currency, because you are referencing the gold standard, fiat, and comparing them to Bitcoin.  Gold standard is history.  It isn't accepted because the government made a law saying that noted based on generated debt is legal tender.  In a system where money is debt and there is more debt than money because of how the money is created, who wins?  The ones creating the money.
