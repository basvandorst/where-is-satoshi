I don't know anything about purse, but, to me, bitcoin to discounted Apple products=scam or fraud.     
I know people use fraudulent credit card info to send online purchases to unsuspecting "customers" who send bitcoin because they think they are getting a discount.    
Just unsure where the hammer swings on this Purse.

hmmmm, mining OR Ponzi scheme?

You can use your public key, and signed messages to prove it is you on the profile section.  (I assume)  
Just don't mention Open anywhere on Ebay.

sounds like you talked your friend in to using bitcoin to pay someone to use fraudulent credit card info to buy her an apple watch.

go to  enter the address you sent to, see if it's transfering, it's not instant.

Nothing being done today will be relevant after quantum computers activate.

Any coins today stored locally, for example, would be considered extremely un-secure.  People would need to transfer to the next generation "q-bitcoit" and the price of BTC would drop very low.

depends on the bank of your credit card.  Most likely you will be charged a cash advance fee, but there are some cards that don't charge the fee.

I watched the video, and that is by definition a Ponzi Scheme    
A Ponzi scheme (/ˈpɒn.zi/; also a Ponzi game)[1] is a fraudulent investment operation where the operator, an individual or organization, pays returns to its investors from new capital paid to the operators by new investors, rather than from profit earned through legitimate sources -Wiki

So, you click on Details, and then continue to unsafe site.

Wait for it to increase in value.  
Or take a big chance loosing it.

I do like the concept, I just don't think you understand what it would really take to be able to sell the first "coin" without having the government come down like a ton of bricks.

First, intending to form an "Independent Nation" is meaningless without a [constitution]( (or draft of).

Sounds to me like you are getting in to the area of commodity markets,  financial derivatives and exchange-traded funds, which are all heavily regulated industries.   
The massive red tape, and legal guidance would be overwhelming.   
Chances are the major industry players are currently analyzing the concept.
 
@_date: 2016-07-26 07:34:25
Bitcoin is just code.  The value is what ever the market demands.  
When you say "Hold the gold, create the certificate..." you have just entered regulated territory.    
One would be at the mercy of the government of the country the gold is being held in.
