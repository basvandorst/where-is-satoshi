I didn't really look into the algoritm of other trading bots, but I just started creating my own. Basically the script works a following:
When you start the app, a 'mainpoint' is being set (the current value) and a margin is being calculated (1% of the current value). Every 3 seconds the app checks if it is smart to perform an action. When de value of 1 bitcoin drops below the mainpoint - marge, it buys. When the value then reaches the mainpoint + marge, it sells. The idea of the app is to concentrate on the little value changes in bitcoin (and there are a lot).
This is the basic idea behind the app but there are a few tricks like; when the value is mainpoint - marge, is doesn't buy untill the value starts rising again (so when the value drops, you buy at its lowest point).
If I publish the script, I will publish it free for everyone to use and edit.

I always make sure the margin to buy/sell is big enough to make a profit by setting the margin based on the current value of 1 bitcoin. The mainpoint (the point on what I base my buys/sells) changes as the value of bitcoin changes. When this goes up, the mainpoint gets higher, when it goes down, the mainpoint get lower. This way you always have the latest changes included in the calculation weather to buy or sell. I always trade with 0.1 bitcoin now at a time because I don't want to invest to much money on it.
Is this an answer to your question?

I'd like to share the code with you, but I'm not feeling to confident to share it already. There are still some issues I want to fix before sharing it with anyone.
For example, I do not know how it will peform when buying/selling more then 0.1 bitcoin at a time.
