ah ok thanks for the heads up.

In the case you outlined, its not your bitcoin yet and they have no obligation to sell it to you.
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:10:39
he bought it.

Even that one was taken down.

I definitely do see newsweek as unreliable at the very least.

You youre just stating opinion as fact.

I own less than a bitcoin and can't wait for bitcoin to be commonly accepted. It is a revolutionary way to think of money and many people just can't grasp the idea.

You must be just skimming the posts if you think only jokes are posted. Every single technical flaw that is brought up is discussed seriously and if a consensus is reached the dev tries to come up with a solution. The 3 way fork over Christmas, the dust issue, the cap vs uncap. All these things were talked about and a lot of people learned a great deal about cryptos.

I wish more people would see it this way. Arguing about which community is better or which coin will succeed is pointless and diverts attention away from the real goal. Which is to provide an alternative to the current banking system.
But it is these human flaws which drives a divide between groups. It's been happening since forever and its hard to fight against it. Ultimately, I hope that the smarter and wiser redditors of both groups realize this and will just continue to do what they feel is best and ignore the idiots.

Wow, you dont even know your bitcoin history.

Thats what their slogan may very well be, but not everyone on their payroll will be following that ideal. Personal agenda's, corruption, etc will play a part on how this power get used. I'd rather not have one organization have this much power without public oversight.

I like the other posts you've made here, and I'd like to see your arguments against why you think his comment does not make sense.

You have a point but he is referring to the value of 10 pounds. In terms of what it can purchase or 10 pounds worth of goods.

Ideally, there would only be 2 parties in a trade, the buyer and seller. There is a verifiable transaction record so the seller or buyer cannot claim ignorance.

Some people are worried how all this volatility impacts BTC as a currency.

Astroturfing and small blockers doesn't make sense. By definition astroturfing is large organizations pretending to be a grass roots initiative.

This has never been the case.

If its patented, we should be able to get the patent files to confirm it.

Lmao, you could say that about any country.
