There is value in scarcity, even if it's only perceived scarcity. 
It's easy to understand the scarcity of 21m BTC, not so much when you're talking about many trillions of 'Bits'

Here's the famous clip from the Today Show in 1995 with Katie Couric, Bryant Gumbel, and Elizabeth Vargas trying to explain the 'internet' to each other.

It's up $1500 in just a week, a small drop is nothing, hell, a $1500 drop at this point is really nothing.

I've got a lovely paper wallet in a safe.

With the Westminster Dog Show happening tonight, it makes me think of my favorite animal charity, PAWS. It's where my dog, Rudiger, came from. They do great work with domestic and wild animals in the Seattle area. paws.org

I would ensure that your business is listed on sites such as spendbitcoins.com and coinmap.org that attempt to index all of the businesses that accept crypto as a form of payment.

If it wouldn't screw up the store too much, have a Bitcoin ATM put in. There are any number of providers ( and it would likely drive some traffic into your store.

I read an article on slate.com about BTC when it was about $3, searched around for how to acquire some and couldn't really figure it out. Ended up buying some stock in Sirius (essentially flat since I bought), Whole Foods (essentially flat since I bought) and Jones Soda (down 90%!). The $750 I put into those three could be north of $500k if I had just followed through.
Oh well, that's life. Anyone that got rich I tip my hat to them and I'm just happy that the $100 in DOGE I bought a few years ago appreciated enough that I was able to turn it into 0.7 BTC.
