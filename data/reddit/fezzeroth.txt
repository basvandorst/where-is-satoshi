The saying is "Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered."  Therefore it might have been prudent that he took some gains.  If he believes in Bitcoin as a longterm investment, as long as he doesn't cash out at a lower price than $1100 you may be eating your words one day.

Go to  and create an account and they will provide you with a web wallet. Once you are logged into your web wallet click on the import/export tab. You will see a feild for paper wallet import. Put your private key in there and if done corrctely it will import the address into your blockchain.info web wallet. 
The balance should now reflect the amount of bitcoins that were given to you in the paper wallet. You can now spend and move your bitcoins around safetly.
 Just make sure you back up the seed generated by blockchain.info when you created the account just in case you loose your password. I also suggest you store the paper wallet somewhere safe as a backup to any bitcoins that remain at that address. Lastly set up 2 factor athentification on you blockchain.info account for enhanced security. 
Hope this helps.

I wasn't looking at this from a consumer perspective rather a commercial one.  So companies that are partially controlling the IOT device network.  So them recalling machines on the field if their central key database that holds 1 of 2 keys is compromised.

Well im trusting the toaster to hold 1 of 2 keys.  If the toaster is compromised the rest of my toaster network is not.  If my central server holding my 1 of 2 keys for all the toasters is compromised then my toasters are not.  I recall all toasters and load new keys?

Not sure why your getting downvoted for your honesty. If someone could please point to a company thats making money that's not a liquidity provider that would be great.

Well the biggest issue with the credit card example is that you would be relying/trusting on the the payment processor/ credit card company to be honest and keep your keys safe.  We all know how that goes.  In my example thats replaced by a trustless system, Bitcoins Blockchain.  Therefore you have no one to censor your command to the machine.  Just you, the device, and the blockchain.

This statement is filled with so much hubirus. I must have missed the memo where people need to have a "damn good reason" to include transactions in the blockchain. Who determines what's good or not. You? How does high transaction fees affect the ability for people to experiment and try new things. Oh that's right sidechines something that seems very promising but is still in development needs some sort forks to work and is just in alpha. I don't think Satoshi envisioned anyone needing a damn good reason according to anyone to include transactions in the blockchain. Bitcoin is permissionless nobody needs a "damn good reason"

I'll give it a stab. 
I think the idea is that machines loaded with bitcoin and a bitcoin wallet can "check in" when they are plugged in and authenticate themselves by signing a transaction with the private keys they control. Maybe the machine is loaded with 1 of 2 priv keys needed to sign multisig transaction and the controller of the machine has the other. When machine comes online it creates transaction that it relays to a central server to be signed by the person or organisation that put it out into the world and wants to control/trust it. This means that you would have to hack the machine and central server to control the device. This means the machine is independent and is only at risk of being hacked itself. Compromising that machines priv keys would only mean losing that machine. This is contrary to holding auth keys for devices all in one place making it easier to hack and control all machines part of that network. It puts the device on its own little self authenticating island. 
You can take it a but further and theorize that it may be possible to also issue orders to the machine via the blockchain every 10 min like cpu cycles. So the machine says hey I want to do this relays the transaction to home base which then signs off with their key and broadcast to the blockcgain. Take my theorys with a grain of salt. Im not am expert on IOT. I may be totally wrong but that's how I interpreted all the buzz.

And their coin will be stuck in their shitty silo or trade out to bitcoin :) to get to other silos/markets.

Thanks for the tip! Going in her college fund.
