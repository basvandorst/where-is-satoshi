Yes he does.  I'm living on cryptos today because of advice I heeded from Andreas in 2013 (keep btc off exchanges).  Funny because about the same time Ver was telling me MtGox was safe.   Had I listened to Ver, the 150 btc I bought at Gox would be toast and I'd be a broke ass depressed fulltime code monkey today that I was back then.

I own 24 ghs at CEX.io, purchased @ .039 ghs/btc.  It's been very profitable, especially if I was to sell those ghs right now at .044 ghs/btc.
I also own a BFL 30 ghs miner, which I recently directed to CEX.io.  The main reason I did this was to collect the merge mined IXcoin, Devcoin, and Namecoins, at 0% pool fee, a service not offered by BFL's pool, or Bitminter.
I know and understand the 51% problem, so I need to move, but I can't find another pool that offers all the same perks as CEX.io.  Someone point me in the right direction.  Thanks!

I agree completely.  BTC-e, CEX.io, even Stamp still give me the willies.  I feel a little better using Coinbase, but they're horrible for day trading and offer no altcoins.  Come on Ben Lawsky, hurry the hell up and allow someone to open a real exchange here in US.

Waco resident here...time for me to get to work.  I know three or four businesses that should be taking coins but don't.

I have the same complaint about Coinbase, they seem to take their sweet random time charging my bank account, which gets very confusing and has cost me one $28 NSF charge already.  It is my mistake, granted, but if they would simply deduct the USD from the account at time of purchase, it wouldn't have happened.  argh.

Wish I could get back the 2 BTC I bought at an average of 950.  I didn't hit their fraud trigger because I did the buy-in over two weeks at .1 BTC a day.  Paid as high as 1158 at one time.  Some of it still coming in.
Regardless, buying from Coinbase was 1000 times easier than my initial MtGox buy in July 2011.  I highly recommended their service, so far.
