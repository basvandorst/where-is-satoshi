I use my wells Fargo bank account and debit card to buy bitcoin all the time they approved me for purchases when I called them tho
@_date: 2019-03-02 23:13:35
Lol duh but I can buy using my checking account through coinbase

You can buy bitcoin at coinstar at least where I live, I've done it with just a few dollars of cash, even the homeless and unbanked can buy bitcoin at least someplaces

I bought some from a coinstar a few weeks was smooth and easy! Well easy for turning cash into bitcoin, obviously easier ways to do it with visa or a bank

It's worth nothing so... just use any paper it's the same idea
@_date: 2019-02-23 18:09:27
You could use a paper wallet

Yeah well the prediction is that after 2021 it's not measured in dollars anymore.. so if this is real, what you say makes no sense is irrelevant

Yah I meant with nothing to take its place, but we do Amazon can make it's own crypto and people will understand it is money because of bitcoin
Yah I see too many big global businesses based out of the states to see it collapse horribly just a little transition of power and change in way of life, but things will go on but I honestly think it's already happening

Fly down and buy stuff :)

Of course no one is going to use them all lol, but doesn't mean everyone needs to use one..

2008 is dubbed bad because of what would have happened had bailouts and money printing not happened, but now debts are just higher, inflation higher, and the bubble is gunna pop once the Petro dollar loses relevance. The us will collapse horribly imo if the banking system collapses with nothing to step in and take its place, luckily I think a crypto currency  from corporations will step in to take the place of a failing goverment and the banks, whatever currency's Amazon, Walmart and groceries stores take will be prolly be thier own crypto, and they will use that control to in a sense become the new goverments or at least work without them

While I am a big believer of history repeating itself, honestly I think we are in a situation we have never experienced in history or is recorded, and imo I think we are on a cusp of major historical changes like corporations just becoming more powerful and relevant than the goverment, or at least pull goverment strings like the banks do, but personally I see banks already being phased out of the equation by corporations using some shitty centralized crypto, or quasi decentralized. And an app that interchanges any money to any crypto you need instantly, so every corporation is in charge of thier currency like goverments are now, and most will fail at it, but bitcoin will be the new usd backing everything, and bitcoin will enable an entire new economy like gold did in the past, so you can just keep your money in bitcoin but shop anywhere that takes any currency anywhere in the world, but I feel sadly most won't be able to afford to hold sats and just live paycheck to paycheck like they do now off some shitty currency

That's why you buy some everyday!
@_date: 2019-04-14 20:03:45
Yah cause ya gotta flash cash and act like a baller to buy stuff.. you can be humble ya know... but I never asked how to help or really want to so I'll pass on going down, but if people ask how they can help that's a way to, helping others isn't always safe ya know lol
@_date: 2019-04-03 04:02:58
Confusing but intresting
@_date: 2019-04-03 00:20:31
Coinstar works out and just takes cash so no need for banks
@_date: 2019-04-13 22:01:47
1. Litterally the title lol
@_date: 2019-09-19 16:00:20
Yah which is what they do all the time like the last 2 days.. but cant make imaginary money forever, also didnt know you could OWNLY buy things from corporations, not like the internet is global and I could use it to buy stuff from individuals over the entire planet without restrictions
@_date: 2019-09-19 17:36:12
Perhaps companies could buy product from individual producers and cut out the middle men and pay them p2p and those individuals could use the BTC to buy things from the company in return, and consumers could buy stuff using local currency or BTC, and the company could use local currency to pay tax and buy more BTC to pay producers
@_date: 2019-09-19 15:13:09
How they gunna invade an internet protocol? Easy for old people to shoot each other not so easy to have to think, think about how the bittorent protocol it is just fine tho piracy has been under attack from the goverment for like decades lol libra is easy to attack facebook is a company not a protocol like bitcoin
@_date: 2019-09-19 15:45:59
Companies not accepting it doesnt defeat a p2p currency.. and the us government will go broke trying to control bitcoin imo cause they already broke, if I can buy some shoes from a friend for any amount of BTC then it works
@_date: 2019-09-19 18:04:07
Yah I agree but do you think if you sold something a day before the feds decided to print 100b plus in 48 hours you might not getting jipped as that has to affect the dollars value at somepoint
@_date: 2019-05-05 01:24:34
I think he was talking about the banking empire and its evils being outed by bitcoin.. and making history think he was the bad guy..
@_date: 2018-12-16 12:34:01
