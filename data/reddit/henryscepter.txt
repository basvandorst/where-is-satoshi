You mean proof of stake (PoS). Yeah, it is good because it consumes less electricity.
Think of Ethereum as a global computer on which you can run programs in a tamperproof way. Today's society is kept together with trust and agreements between organizations and individuals. With Ethereum that kind of trust is no longer needed. Instead society can trust the blockchain and the code that runs on the blockchain. Society can be made a lot more effective and automated that way. For this reason it is possible for many jobs to be overtaken by the blockchain.

The fees should, of course, be minimized as much as possible. For every cent fees goes down the intrinsic value of bitcoin goes up. However, it's important to maintain censorship resistance.

what does the price of one coin has to do with whether to use it as a currency? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:42:19
I don't agree. I don't think of bitcoin cash as a replica. I see it more like someone cutting out a piece of the original mona lisa painting. What you are left with are two original paintings representing a whole if they were merged together again. Before fork 100% of the community was bitcoin. After fork x% of the community is bitcoin and y% of the community is bitcoin cash. I think you are biased because you belong to x% of community and not the y%. I think most people see it like this, but if you are heavily invested in either bitcoin or bitcoin cash you might be prone to bias and subjective reasoning in either direction.

Are you advocating for censorship or certain transactions that are considered "spam"?
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:38:41
some wise words right there. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:01:18
hi person from 2040!!! waving to you!!
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:50:44
the question is, if the economy went south, would people sell bitcoins or buy more?
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:00:16
BTC are working on off-chain solutions for scaling, while BCH is on-chain (making the blocks bigger). BTC says that big blocks make bitcoin more prone to censorship and miner centralization. BCH says small blocks make bitcoin more prone to censorship and payment-channel centralization. BTC strong points are name recognition and integration into lots of systems. BCH strong point is that they **currently** handle scaling better supposedly. BCH also has some kind of algorithm called EDA which protects against network congestion. However, from my understanding, BTC thinks that it is wrong to change the mining difficulty.
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:01:48
It's hard to say whether it has any value since it's so expensive to make bitcoins and environmentally unfriendly. But there is value in censorship resistance and mathematically predefined low inflation rate.
So I think that bitcoin always will be valuable, even if it fails to become a shopping currency. However, other projects such as Ethereum brings more utility to the world. Ethereum can be the catalyst that will drive automation of our society, which will bring the employment rate down to single digits, so we can live more fulfilling lives.
So I think that people are buying bitcoin because currently, it is the most well-known crypto. Also, if bitcoin is able to scale in an environmentally friendly way, then it could also be used as a global currency. I think there are a lot of people out there hoping for that to happen. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:53:11
I think it's more than supply which will determine which cryptocurrency will be the dominant one for the masses.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:27:28
One side takes something that works and just make it bigger, the other side invents new systems on top of the original system. Are we sure these new systems will be as decentralized as the original system? It is hard to tell if you don't know the details of these implementations (which I do not). From an outside perspective all you can do is to take the word of people as there seems to be no way to prove one is better than the other when it comes to the decentralizing aspect.

oh nice, so you won't ban me :) well, then that is great. I got a few BCH now. I hope it doesn't tank and while I go to sleep :/ I haven't slept all night. Just watching the charts :P I need to set some stop loss I presume
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:59:17
No, it doesn't. Because bitcoin is a cryptocurrency developed by an anonymous person. This anonymous person/organization has not said that forks are invalid. Satoshi has never endorsed BTC over BCH. So it is different.
I think that forks are great for cryptomarkets as a whole. Because competing forks will compete and that drives innovation. If it takes 2 days to send a transaction with BTC right now, then that means BCH is king because BCH does it faster. If BTC innovates in a few months and is able to create an extremely fast network with LN, then many will move back. Don't ever be too attached to a coin. It will just cost you a lot of money.
I watched my favorite coin bleed 70% of my savings not too long ago. Not making the same mistake again.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:53:40
it will go to 2000-500$ I think. But i own a few BCH so I might be biased (sorry if I FUD). But it is my honest opinion. I don't care about which coin is best. I just look at how congested bitcoin chain is right now compared to BCH. (please don't ban me)
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:57:35
I don't agree. BCH is as much bitcoin as BTC is.
Why do you think one of them is more the "true" coin and the other one is an "alt"?
They are two mighty twins. The mightest twins in crypto right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:19:09
BCH has some kind of mining upgrade on the 13th, which is supposed to stabilize profits for miners. So I think that date is important for this particular pump. I would say the trend will continue until that date.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:38:27
It all depends on what miners choose to do in the next hours.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:50:49
you have to learn this lesson some time in your life.
whales will do whatever they can to take your money.
the best victims are those that are attached to their coins.
so if you like BTC and love the community, sure (Y), that is a good thing.
but don't feel obligated to lose your money just because you don't want to betray your coin.
As I said, I watched my favorite coin drop from 0.52 dollar to 0.15 and I didn't sell. Because I was naive.
Good luck man!
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:03:11
I'm definitely buying a few BTC if it goes that low. But I don't think it ever will. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:17:56
I am also in that camp but I am diversified. Are you?
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:10:36
They have the exact same history up until a few months ago. Bitcoin is a community effort. It does not belong to a special set of people. It belongs to the community. Bitcoin is divisible into a few variations. To assume those variations are not valid is like hating your brother just because you compete with each other sometimes.
Let's say you have a company grown by 10 people. If 5 people branch in one direction and 5 people branch in the other direction. If 5 of those people got the keep the company name... do you suddenly assume that those people who didn't get to keep the name are totally invalid? It will be two twin organizations that specialize in different things. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:29:43
Look man, I don't give a fuck whichever coin wins. I am a poor student basically. It is what the big players want, not what I want. And the big players are heavily invested in BTC and as a consequence of that, also BCH.
BCH and BTC are linked by the spine. That is something you should realize.
LTC might do well as well, but it is not as good of a bet as BCH at this very moment.
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:07:32
My plan is to sell at 0.3 BTC. I think that is about how far it will go, before it comes back down again.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:18:48
Everyone knows cryptocurrencies are volatile right now in 2017. It will be another story in 5 years. BTC can't fail completely and if it goes down now it might go up again when LN gets implemented. It is all about which coins have the best tech and the fastest transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:42:10
I'm sorry but you are deluded
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:31:16
If a coin is in a downtrend holding is bad. I think it is better to move one's assets to FIAT in such times. But if you hold for ideological reasons I understand the sentiment.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:07:00
Why would it be the failure of all crypto coins? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:28:33
Very true. I think both are valid currencies. Guess what? Bitcoin is meant to be forked so different versions of bitcoin can flourish so people who like each other and have the same ideas can work together.
This is the beauty of open source folks. This is why Satoshi never revealed his identity. Because he didn't want to be the one who decides what happens to bitcoin.
