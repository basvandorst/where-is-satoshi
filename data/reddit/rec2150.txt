After February might go ATH after Chinese new year, and all income tax money invested to bitcoins...!!!!!! (ding! ding! ding! ding!)

I think someone just sold a big chunk of bitcoins at low price thats why it dropped, but is just a guess.

Yes true same here, why would they post that... maybe someone bought a bunch or they are preparing for a price dip, so no one can buy during a price dip...

Just saying for those who were not aware, and also to get some feed back on Decembers end.

Ok I wasn't understanding also , so that means that they are skipping the middle man (in bank fees, tax, etc) which is good, right??

Ha same here , hesitated but got in.

What !!!!!! What happened??? You so guuud!!!!
@_date: 2013-11-22 12:23:06
I had the same question, what if after you bought at MtGox you send it back to coinbase and sell there, would that work?

No cash , but have been following the whole story , so when I get my hands on some cash it's going straight to btc...
