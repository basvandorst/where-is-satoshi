Yeah, banking problem is big. I also know of the Silicon Valley bank that our previous UK company was using. I read that they are quite crypto friendly. It's probably quite lucrative just building a regular bank that's friendly to crypto. 
Firstly, I need to prove that there is the necessary demand to get the idea of ground. I'm still not sure how much people care about bitcoin. For us, the benefits are obvious. The public still has so much to learn! 
Thanks for EU's 5th AML directive tip. I'm in London once in a while. If that's where you live, I'd love to invite you for coffee. 
@_date: 2018-10-07 22:01:43
I'm gonna get back to you in 4 weeks with some preliminary results
@_date: 2018-10-19 12:35:23


I love the interface. It's simple, clean! Man, we need organizations auditing private key creation engines on the web. I can't read any code. 
@_date: 2018-10-18 15:22:50
They can check the BTC amount on the public address and transfer the BTC to their own wallet.

Hey, I’m from Darmstadt, Hessen. I’m currently working on a Bitcoin Cold Wallet prepaid card, that I’ll start selling at local cornershops. If interested, reach back and let’s jump on a call. 
@_date: 2018-10-18 20:33:34
Two my knowledge, there are two bitcoin friendly banks in germany called fidor bank and solaris bank. Their service Bitwala from Berlin and bitcoins.de for btc on and off ramp. 
ideally i sell vouchers that can be redeemed on a complimentary website. It'd verify manually if the code submitted is one that I have send out to a retail outlet, i send the 10euro bitcoin to any address that they provide. ideally typing the voucher code on my website would onboard them with instructions on have public/private cryptography works. 
but i need a technical co-founder if I throw away the cold wallet business idea
I have 10k in BTC colleteral. 
@_date: 2018-10-07 00:39:05
yeah, that's too complicated. 
@_date: 2018-10-08 13:26:29
I know. I've been in this space for a few years. It's just a new wallet that contains enough bitcoin to have a small amount after paying transaction fees. Maybe 1 or 2 dollars. Not trying to lose money. Setup a QR code that directs to a google drive where I'll update the private key daily for a new wallet. 
@_date: 2018-10-13 14:53:22
thanks, really cool.
@_date: 2018-10-06 20:31:13
Common mate, you're in on r/bitcoin. Our dicks are pointing at only one direction, the decentralised financial future. 
@_date: 2018-10-08 13:29:09
I'm using  to ask people scanning if they want to share their location with me. So it's kinda optional geocaching. Somebody needs to build wallets that provide smart ways to market ERC tokens in a unique fashion...
@_date: 2018-10-18 16:32:09
Awesome, I’ll check it out
@_date: 2018-10-07 17:04:36
They also require you to redeem your BTC on their website. That's not anonymous. 
@_date: 2018-10-07 00:42:23
or just send bitcoin to the billboard address daily or a few hours after somebody moved them from the billboard away. 
@_date: 2018-10-07 16:38:10
Let me explain my thinking. I live in a town in Germany where 1 of every 5 people is a student. The hypothesis is that there is demand for cold bitcoin wallets that I can sell at local corner-shops. 19€ for every 20€ sold of BTC. I want to measure location depended the demand for Bitcoin. The first idea is to hang out bitcoin wallets with the private key public on posters. Regardless of having BTC on stored on the cold wallet or not, it should be possible to count the number of people scanning the QR code to view balance on blockchain or enter wallet through private key. Maybe the train station attracts more people than the university cafeteria...it's worth finding out. 
@_date: 2018-10-07 16:39:39
thanks elon. I'll probably just use the mnemonic phrase riddled like in the price is right. 
@_date: 2018-10-18 19:06:15
Yes, I know. Obviously the usability will improve over time. But the opportunity is to build an end to end experience with a well designed wallet. I have added my phone number on the card. 
@_date: 2018-10-18 19:02:35
Thanks. If you want to pm me your address I’d be willing to send you a sample product for free. I’d appreciate your feedback. I’ll put some BTC on top for testing purposes. No joke! 
@_date: 2018-10-18 16:52:38
I’ll take the risk. 
@_date: 2018-10-07 16:46:01
thats a smart idea!
@_date: 2018-10-18 18:58:50
No, you are a business since BTC is legally accepted a medium of exchange. But I’m probably wrong. Can you provide some evidence of that. I’d appreciate if you do.
@_date: 2018-10-18 16:20:33
I’m planning on selling paper wallets at local corner-shops. On the back of the card, I have instructions to download the mycelium wallet and scan the private key to control the BTC. 
Thinking about costumer experience for the masses in Germany (rather low trust in digital systems) in a easy, scalable way, paper wallets seems the best solution. Additionally, after the purchase of the Bitcoin card, I assume that people will have incentive to follow some instructions.
Ideally, in a distant feature, you’d have a terminal at local cornershops (a modified smart phone that’s connected to a debit/credit card machine) that transfers securely Bitcoin to costume addresses.
Demand is not proven yet, so paper wallets seem like the strategic best solution on testing easy access to BTC in general public. 
@_date: 2018-10-07 16:59:02
Thanks, there are a number of startups doing this. It's a race for market dominance. I just think they have a horrible name, bad website. Have not proven if they are sales savy enough to reach my market in the next 1-2 years. I doubt that...
@_date: 2018-10-07 17:06:37
Yeah, thanks Satoshi. I'll just put the public or private key in a google drive. That way I can at least count the views
@_date: 2018-10-07 00:41:09
yeah, it's too complex. I think the best idea is to just send some crypto to that BTC billboard wallet daily or as soon as crypto moves
@_date: 2018-10-07 16:46:24
yes. Not giving up like that...
@_date: 2018-10-19 12:28:23
Thanks, I've made this offer before. But if you want to PM me your address or post box, I can send you a copy of our product. I'd be sending from Germany. I'd appreciate your feedback! 
@_date: 2018-10-07 00:44:24
I like that. Using a riddle around the mnemonic phrase is actually fun enough to unlock a cold wallet with BTC 
@_date: 2018-10-07 07:17:55
just a paper board
@_date: 2018-10-18 16:09:36
Thanks. I appreciate your comment. It gave me some reasons to think about. This is practically a pilot program. I want to extend this to the public market in my hometown in Germany. Basically offer anybody the opportunity to buy plastic cards that act as Bitcoin cold Storage. I’m planning on selling this at major traffic point such as city centre, train stations etc. I have 0 intention of scamming my costumers by taking away the BTC after their purchase. I’ll explicitly recommend instruct costumers to transfer the coins to their own wallet. 
If anybody is aware of how I can improve the cold wallet security by implanting easy mechanism that increase security on the wallets that i created, that be great. 
I’m concerned over some of the Bitcoin wallet creation tools since I have difficulty ensuring myself that the seed generators are truly random and not deterministic to any degree. The wallets will only contain small amounts of crypto between 10-20 euros. 
@_date: 2018-10-18 16:32:24
Awesome, I’ll check it out. 
@_date: 2018-10-06 20:28:03
Thanks, but the main idea is that it's printed, sprayed on a brick wall (or any flat surface). Can't afford 100 screens, but 100 paper sheets with some printing. Don't want to build any costume website, just a some configurable wallet, that executes time based code on how the wallet is supposed to act. 
@_date: 2018-10-18 18:34:09
I’m charging the same fee structure as Coinbase, only allow jumping the process of KYC/AML, linking credit cards, waiting time for wire transfers and security.
@_date: 2018-10-06 20:05:29
suck elon dick
@_date: 2018-10-06 20:25:03
Wow..no ability to punch back. Typical virgin complaining about tits
@_date: 2018-10-07 16:45:14
Thanks mate! Good to hear some encouragement. I want to build a startup around giving super simple access to BTC. What's better than cold wallets at your local cornern-shop storing BTC. Simple, fast and anonymous. No bank transfer, no KYC/AML. I want to do some inexpensive, but bold marketing. Why not use the strengths of crypto? Provide access to a BTC wallet (could be empty) and make people scan the QR code with their wallet app. I want to know, are there any people out there that at least know how BTC works? Is there surprisingly high demand? What's better than actual money as incentive. If I distribute wallets across town, is there any easy way to figure out how many people scan the code? This is what I'm looking to solve. Plus, it's election day in my county. Lots of ugly politicians that need their face covered with the decentralised financial future...


@_date: 2018-10-07 00:42:55
good idea but takes away the magic from using Bitcoin with a cold wallet. 
@_date: 2018-10-07 05:41:08
Thanks. I'm trying to launch a cold wallet prepaid card business for Bitcoin here in my hometown. Idea is to sell 10 and 20 euro cold wallets of BTC at local corner shops. I just think that there are some very exciting ways to do marketing, something never possible before. If I hang out cold wallet private keys on billboards, posters that are spread around strategically important locations for my business, I could get some sells going. Idea is how I can get people engaged in a wallet poster like that. They could also send some BTC to a public key and be selected randomly for a 10$ BTC price. 
@_date: 2018-10-07 05:37:09
Thanks, I'm just figuring out how to do some unique marketing. Obviously the wallets are for the public to play with. Just discovering the best ways to engage people with a wallet thats printed on a  billboard
@_date: 2018-10-18 16:28:17
ATMs are cool but the unit cost of deploying a single one just kills my budget. Plus, I think current Bitcoin ATM design is a legacy solution since unlike credit cards, message interception is not critical. 
It’d be way cheaper to provide a multi sig wallet on the corner shop owner smartphone that transfers BTC to costumer wallets after they provably pay for the amount to be transferred. I think the process needs some thinking but it can be solved. They way, cash security is shifted from ATM box to store owner, unit cost of deploying decreases and building fiat on and off ramp should also be easier. Also, store owner can start accepting BTC as payment. It’s all about building a backend solution for the corner shop operator and the amateur BTC user.
@_date: 2018-10-07 00:39:43
good, by mainstream adoption needs paper wallets
@_date: 2018-10-07 00:38:40
hmm, that's actually a good point. I'm doing this project in 200k resident city in Germany. I'd positively be surprised if somebody would use that level of sophistication. 
@_date: 2018-10-18 18:43:34
Mate, I’m going to build this business. I want to sell easy access to bitcoin and if you can come up against a more frictionless process to sell bitcoin let me know. Also, I don’t have a VC or ICO money. Just a few grant to scale a business. If I’m planning on defrauding people for 10 or 20 euro of BTC, then I’d probably not try to sell something retail in some sort of environment of contractual agreement covered by law...
@_date: 2018-10-06 20:00:08
The main idea is to scan the private key. First to scan, can send the first tranche of free BTC to any address they please. Second to scan, must wait 24h before second tranche can be unlocked. Is there any way, wallet or easy code I can execute within the blockchain to achieve this goal? I'd be disappointed if it's really complicated after 800BILLION$$$ bullrun... 
@_date: 2018-10-08 13:24:25
Yeah, that's a cool idea but I don't have the budget to set up displays in public. QR code pointing to a service provider where I can change the redirect link. That way I can upload randomly for each billboard the private key for a new wallet. 
@_date: 2018-10-07 17:03:41
I'd argue that organising a bitcoin meetup is far more complicated that hanging out a few posters. I'm able to reach far more people and the chance that everybody that shows interest will show up is really small. With a poster, conversion rate is high because there is the promise of free money. I'm not branding the posters, just a plain orange poster with massive QR code and the words free bitcoin. I'm not putting my reputation up, but at least I know if there are people going far enough to scan.
@_date: 2018-10-18 16:12:27
If that means that I have to type some code into the client and communicate directly with the network,
I’m not savy enough. Plus i don’t have enough space to sync the complete blockchain. 
@_date: 2018-10-18 20:17:04
Yeah, that I definitely need to do. Thanks, stranger. 
@_date: 2018-10-06 20:33:26
Has some crypto visionary figured out how a 5 year old can setup a smart contract on top of a wallet?
@_date: 2018-10-18 20:27:18
That's cool but has an interface problem with mobile phones. I think that the UX design around hardware wallets is harder than paper wallets. The information is easier to extract and arguably safer. Unless you have NFC communication on secure hardware enclave. But paper wallets are still cheaper. 
My margins are 9.9% for 10€ BTC. That needs to cover plastic card, QR code stickers, cover sticker for private key and instruction manual that also holds card. Profit margins are low at low volume sales, so I need to figure out cheap way to put btc on the cards with low transaction fees. Lightning might be useful but too experiemtal.
