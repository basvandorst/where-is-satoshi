You'll probably get downvoted for this but there are all fantastic reasons.  Growing up my parents got a rescue dog.  It was loving, sweet, and cuddly.  Unless you were a little kid running.  It damn near took my right ear off one day playing in the yard.

It was a mix from the pound.  No clue.  Found a reputable breeder and got an English Springer Spaniel after that and she was amazing.  I still miss her.

Right?  I feel like this must have been how my parents felt with Microsoft and what not.

Damn it.  Well I guess it's a good thing I never bought anything three years ago.

So apparently I made a coinbase account three years ago but never pulled the trigger (whoops.)  Today I finally decided to jump in and logged in for the first time since.  Then I saw my activity log and something screwy happened a year ago because I promise I was never in Brazil!

At $7,500 an insane pump hasn't already taken place?!  Jesus.

It's definitely late compared to when I first was aware of it.

I have (2) 980ti in my gaming rig.  NiceHash is getting me about $4 a day according to its estimate (I just started today.)

Best of luck Amagi.  Heaven forbid you accept a currency the government can't manipulate.
