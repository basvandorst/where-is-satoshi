Seriously doubt that a cryptocurrency that a lot of people aren’t involved with is responsible for anything outside of itself

Beginning of the year, before the earlier predictions came true (April/July). We’ll see if it’ll hold through this month. Will be pretty impressive if true

I don’t know, but the top of that sign is written in some demon language and I don’t like it!

Don’t have this though. It would be awesome, but it simply is not possible. This is a cool little run, but it’ll readjust and then continue up. Only invest what you can afford to lose. 
I repeat, only invest what you can afford to lose.

Better get on that

Yes, I know about the post... however I doubt it is a joke. Every time someone talks about their bitcoin accumulation, there’s always that guy that says “$5 wrench attack!!!” Or some variant of that.
@_date: 2019-06-23 06:59:29
I think the real solution is to never buy anything again... we all need to live in a commune where we share everything to avoid people knowing we may have something. Bye bye, bitcoin, it was nice knowing you. Can’t wait to live in my nomadic society and share everything while hunting and gathering with the tribe. I would hate for someone to see that I drive a car that isn’t a Mitsubishi Mirage and attack me for my less than average bank account with a $5 wrench.

Yea, I’m sure these people in their Jags and Porsche’s are really afraid of advertising their wealth. They better take off those plates....

This is just a rumor, if you actually look at him he’s pretty short at 5’7 and about 150-160lbs. Not a very big man at all.

I lol’d because literally 90% of the posts were actually from him
Lol “here’s my evidence.” *proceeds to direct to a conversation of him talking to himself on why he doesn’t like something*
I don’t necessarily even disagree with the guy... just thought the situation was funny
@_date: 2019-06-17 15:27:45
So you want more regulation on these posts?
@_date: 2019-06-04 00:37:47
You’re the reason it’s going down. All investments will fluctuation. You don’t buy low and sell low, or even buy high and sell low... that’s just retarded

I don’t post memes, but as long as it’s bitcoin related material and not explicitly harmful, it don’t necessarily mind it. But if I do mind it, I just keep scrolling.

It’ll be ok. The sellers will sell and the buyers will buy, just like any other market in the world. Those of us who see further value will continue to accumulate, and those that see no value past X will sell. The world will keep turning and bitcoin will Moon

Robinhood is in the works of letting you transfer your crypto. They’re more for stocks and ETFs but they also have no transaction fee. There’s pros and cons of every exchange
@_date: 2019-06-24 19:18:02
This is just anecdotal evidence and fear mongering, similar to the “$5 wrench attack” story people like to bring up. It’s like the recent surge of reports of deaths in the Dominican, when in reality there are no more tourist deaths than usual. Yes, there are criminals in the world, yes they rob people. If I tell you I have 12,000,000 in the bank, you’re probably not going to drive to my house and rob me, and chances are no one else would either.

I got lucky, saw the price decrease and watched it like a hawk, sold all and rebought right when i went back up and made $400 that i used to reinvest into it
