Views on this might differ but a merchant selling coffee would not have to wait for a blockchain confirmation since he is already dealing with the risk of people running away with the coffee wihtout having paid. This is not an actual problem and this kind of theft is already priced in. I'd say that a bitcoin double spent on coffe is even more cumbersome than simply ordering the coffee and running away with it. Still people don't do it.

Where did I say that bitcoin needs him Mr. Strawman? I was pointing out the good stuff he did to help bitcoin go mainstream.


While I don't argue that promoting bitcoin helps everyone who is invested, I don't agree that this was his main motivation. Neither of us can prove whether he did or not - I prefer to stick to my personal opinion I have of him.


So you are proving my point, thanks. You just explained that the only solution for poor people right now are centralised services. You may be new here, but bitcoin was actually quite cheap to use in the first 7 years of its existence. And if you look around almost everybody is interested in bringing the fees down again. It's simply the appraoches to that that differ.
I am aware of the technologies that have been rolled out or are in the pipeline. This doesn't change the fact that mempool is super full and users are paying artificially high fees before the positive effects of these technologies had a chance to unfold.
@_date: 2019-10-15 07:55:39
His node actually did NOTHING - as in 'it did not relay the block'. If his node receives an invalid block and rejects it it's good for the node operator. From the network's perspective there was no difference compared to a case where he didn't even run a node in the first place.

Thanks for having a civilised discussion.
Sorry I cannot comment on each of the four links you posted but I clicked them and think I get your point.
So your problem is obviously that he is "selling" bitcoin cash as the "real bitcoin".
To better understand if that's a deliberate scam or not it's important to define what "the real" bitcoin is. Don't get me wrong, to me it's BTC but I have been trying to get a definition of what bitcoin is from many people including people who contribute to core. Feel free to share your very personal definition but I can tell you that there is no universal definition.
To few it's simply the longest chain attached to satoshis genesis block, to some it's the chain with most economic activity, to some it's the chain with most current PoW backing it, tonaome it's the chain which is the most valuable according to the market, to some it's the chain produced by the software to which  specific developers have contributed,.... 
Most agree it has to include the 21M cap, but some.dont care about who's developing it, to some the price doesn't matter, to some hashpower or PoW doesn't matter.... Etc etc.
As I said, feel free to share your personal definition, but be clear: it will be your own very personal definition. And trust me , if you promote this definition I will not call you a scammer.

Not every fork doubles your coins so that you can cash them out. Most forks are only temporary and die off. If some miners start producing 2x blocks, they will have to cope with the current BTC difficulty. This would mean that new blocks are being found very slowly, almost no node will accept them thus not letting the miners spend the block reward. 
This means spending hashpower on that minority fork is very costly with no profit for them in sight. It will die soon.
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:58:39
I agree with you to some extend. But mostly I'm simply not convinced he is actually trying to scam people.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:57:08
I know many people seem to hate Roger because it's so easy. Please check what he has done for bitcoin and how he contributed his whole life to spread the word and educate. The fact that he is supporting a fork of bitcoin  now doesn't make him evil at all in my eyes. It simply shows that he still follows the same vision he always had. Bitcoin is currently not usable for many people on this planet and I still hope that it will be that again soon and I'm sure you would want that too.
The mining is not that centralised. Therese currently 9 different pools mining blocks on that chain as you can see here: 
I'm not worried about mining centralisation, because we can see that the system works. Miners have a huge stake in the game. Cheating would render their investment useless. And we saw what happens if a pool gains too much percentage. Users leave and that pool does not exist anymore. 
All I'm saying is that your post doesn't help anybody. If he wants to promote cash for being the better alternative, why shouldn't he?

This painting is worth so much because art is a great way to launder money. Scarcity alone is worth nothing. There are other scarce things out there that are worth close to nothing.
If you are looking for a store of value then why not put gold in your safe instead of a hardware or paper wallet of a fantastic digital system that allows for instantaneous, global peer-to-peer transactions. What we need is a truly decentralised system of money (this doesn't exclude being a good store of value or a good investment). And this is what Satoshi provides the world with in 2008. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:50:29


What does the author think his "store of value" would be worth if high fees were the norm? Has he thought about that everybody who wants to store 5 USD in this "store of value" cannot spend them anymore because the fee could easily be higher than the actual amount?
You can have low fees and "not incentivize frivolous spending". This guy should look at something like freicoin, but not try to tell people that bitcoin is a store of value and NOT a medium of exchange like "It may have been advertised as in the past" and that not using it is the solution to global climate change.
Replacing the banking infrastructure with bitcoin is the solution - not not using bitcoin.

It makes no sense calling it centralized without a definition of what centralization you mean.
Hardware, nodes, mining, software, user base, development, ...
I'm not arguing that it is more decentralized than bitcoin (maybe apart from the four implementations that exist for it) but it is certainly still a pretty decentralised system that follows a different approach to scaling.

Is see. I'm spreading Fear. I'm spreading uncertainty. I'm spreading doubt. Hmm, ok. I don't think I did, but I assume it's ok nowadays to use "FUD" on everything that one might disagree with.


I Agree, and I never said they are something else.


Again, I did not say non-mining full nodes do not count. All I said is that you cannot measure them in a reliable manner. Also don't forget that mining-nodes are also full nodes (+x). 


They can only sell their coins to "no one" if 100% of the full nodes you are describing, do not comply with the new forked consesus rules. Why would you think that 90% of miners have 0% of node owners behind them? If think it's pretty unlikely it's going to be like that.
And that's exactly my point - you don't kow, because you cannot reliably measure this.


How? Please don't tell me by "counting" them or their "activity". Have you looked at node-count charts in the past years? Do it and then come back and tell everyone how this is a reliable measure. It's not. Nodes are being spun-up and shut down easily for very low cost.


And that's the beauty of the system. You can do this. And I love the fact that everybody who feels like this is a good thing to do can do this!


As with most things it's obviously not 100% about one thing. There's many people with many opinions involved. While I can clearly see that its about poilitcs for a huge part, for some it might also be about their personal vision or technical matters.
If you think the whole 2x thing is a threat to bitcoin then why are you even bothering? Who would be interested in a system as "weak" as this?
If you think full-nodes have the power to stop this "threat" then you can relax and watch it play out.

By the only measure we have, hashpower support, it looks like the market sees this differently. Don't get me wrong, I'd love to have a system in place were average users also have a vote on changes, but we don't have that. All we have is signaling by hashpower, everything else is Twitter polls, Reddit posts, non-mining node signals and all the other stuff that you cannot reliably measure.

Force a protocol change? Hu? How can they force a protocol change? Last time I checked protocol changes are not pushed with force but pulled by consensus. Devs can offer changes, and mining nodes can vote. And as the past has shown, non mining nodes do also have some power when it comes to accepting protocol changes.

Well bitcoin itself is already "a system with a different set of properties" compared to what it was in the beginning.

There's no fixed fee. Miners include transcations with the highest fee first, then work down the list of pending transactions. Once there's more room for transactions in each block, by either increasing the size of a block itself or by adding more and better second layer functionality that reduced pressure on the firt layer fees will come down.
@_date: 2017-09-21 18:36:26
May be you are right. And this is the good thing. We might not like the 2x approach but the system will work it out, simply because it's designed to do so. If you have money in it, then you should trust it. (Not saying I know whether you own some btc or not, but you get the point)

But how do you know that its price is beyond its value?
Sure, there's bubbles and they pop but if you look at what bitcoin is, what kind of alternative it provides and how people around the globe just start to discover it, with most people not using it or even having heard of it today, you could easily argue that its current price is way below its actual value.
On the other hand, I would not focus on price too much. The are many different indicators that you could look at. Look at the ecosystem build on bitcoin, the amount of hashpower backing the network, the amount of nodes decentralisiung the network, the amount of wallets created, the amount of trades, the amount of VC money flowing into the space, the sheer amount of innovation with many industries not even having started to look at it in more detail....
All this might give you a better feeling for bitcoin's actual utility and value than the price alone. (Athough I think the price htting ATH after ATH only mirrors what I wrote in the latter paragraph)

If you think that's all a miner does you are missing a big piece. What you described is only the PoW part of a miner's tasks. The other task, which is equally important is to validate transactions, **put them in a block**, include the previous block's hash and by propagating this block effectively building the blockchain the whole system is build around. 
If you don't accept other people then those you feel loyal to (and this is not necessarily a bad thing) to work on this OS project and proceed with a backing of 90+% of miner support, bitcoin is not for you. Sorry.

Old news. And I still do not get how this qualifies as sending bitcoin anywhere. A copy of the private key and public address was traveling. The Tx they did (read as moving electrons on the network) didn't leave earth. 
Send a node to space and I'm excited.

Impressive. Could someone tell me how MAST relates to SegWit? The article implies that MAST is "enabled" by SegWit.

Am genuinely interested when he said/wrote that. All I know is this tweet where he thought 2MB first then SW.

Again you're making stuff up. Why would this be the opposite of what he wants for bitcoin?
(I'm not questioning your opinion on the agreement itself.)

Was also wondering that. Looks like small amount trades but for above average price. Volume to low to move the average price. I hope it's not someone paying a premium for untainted coinbase coins.

From what I understand MAST allows us to get rid of the history of a certain address and instead only agree on its current state. This increases the fungibility of bitcoin because you do not know the history of a coin as you might do currently.

I'm still waiting for certain major websites to offer TOTP 2FA. I assume they would have to actively support the Fido approach?

Also, "megatrends" usually tend to be trends that already lasted 10 to 20 years in foresight research.

Off-chain in the case of changetip is probably not the centralized solution people in both subs are looking for.
@_date: 2016-05-06 20:49:09
@_date: 2017-05-24 10:39:57
I'd say it does. The volume is simply too small to impact the average price.
@_date: 2017-05-15 12:31:38
While I agree, I also agree with OP that there seems to be not website that offers this kind of analytics.
- filter by Tx timestamp and output size
- calculate the aproximate fiat amount for that specific date and time
I imaginge this to be quite powerful in a case where you know the fiat amount and time someone spent his coins.

In cryptography you would call what you just described a collision. In bitcoin the chance of generating two key pairs that share the same private key is unfathomable small.
A good representation of this is if you imagine all the sand grains on planet earth ... really all of them. Then imagine each of these is a planet earth on its own with again this amount of sand. The possibility of two people chosing the same grain of sand on all of these earths is so low, it's save to say it won't happen.
But: This depends on the randomnes that's involved in the process of generating the keys. Keys based on low or almost no randomness can actually result in a collision and it has been shown in the past that this is possible.

The hodler's and user's bitcoins only have value because of the miners' work

Usually the bitpay process that steam uses does not wait for any blockchain confirmations. When you pay, the transaction is immediately broadcasted to the network and bitpay recognises your payment almost instantly. You should be able to download your item directly after the payment. For me it's faster than PayPal.

Didn't you write, that SegWit is about the independence of bitcoin from miners?
Now you want to become one?

@_date: 2017-06-08 06:26:20
I'd say yes but it would be more secure to simply sign a transaction with your private key and transfer the funds to the public address associated with the recipient's private key. But that's not what you were asking for.

How can this make the news, when even yesterdays estimated hashrate doesn't show a dip?

I don't know. But because you don't doesn't mean there are no people or businesses that want or need to.
