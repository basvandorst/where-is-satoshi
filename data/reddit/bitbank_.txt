I don't think the problem that Greece is encountering is the same as the the change of bitcoin price in China, the price of bitcoin increases or drops from time to time, it's like stock investment in a way, but it's more than that, there are certain ways to invest and increase the amount of your assets, and that's what we-Bitbank do.

Not all of the bitcoin companies are focusing only on mining, there are  various companies like jua.com and bitbank, are doing bitcoin financial projects and they don't focus only on mining.

We are using wasted hydroenergy for mining, which means it generates electricity by hydroenergy instead of thermal power generation.
@_date: 2015-07-01 03:32:46
maybe there is some misunderstanding,we are just trying to point out that we are recycling the hydroenergy, that's it, we are not saying that mining is not green.

Bitbank is Jua in the future, we bought the domain name and we are gonna launch bitbank.com in the coming future, 11 sec means the time our users invest our financial project, cuz each time we only release a certain number of digital currencies for the users to invest.
