When you sign-in to your Mt. Gox account, click on "Funding Options" on the left-hand side of the screen. From the drop-down menu, select "Redeem Mt. Gox Code" and enter the code in the "Redeemable Code" field. 
I found the code in the confirmation e-mail from BitInstant (originated from "support
My e-mail contained the following information (I removed the actual character stings as to not provide sensitive information):
* OrderID: 
* EventID:
* DestAccount: 
* QuoteID: 
* User: 
* DestExchange: 
* eventtype: 
* EventSentAt: 
* APIResponse: 
* FundsSent: 
I'm pretty confident that it was the string under "APIResponse" that worked in the field to add the funds to Mt. Gox. All I did was copy/paste each string until Mt. Gox accepted and deposited the funds. Hope that helps!

Interesting read but searching "Bitcoin" on Godlike Productions produces [31 results.](

I had a similar problem yesterday; redeeming the deposit code from my confirmation e-mail from BitInstant to Mt. Gox made the funds appear (even though BitInstant states it's unnecessary to do so).

Hi, Chris! Thank you for taking the time to address this post. OANDA currency converter is fantastic and I, and obviously many people in this thread, was excited to see BitCoin added to the list of currencies able to be converted. 
If you wouldn't mind answering: of which BitCoin exchange were you basing the conversion of BitCoin to USD? Thanks again for your time; I hope to see a permanent addition of Bitcoin to OANDA's currency converter in the near future!

No problem! 
I'm really not surprised that mainstream media is taking a critical, borderline fear-mongering approach as the ideology behind BTC seems to go against most of the news outlets' owners; however, I am quite surprised that a forum that labels itself as the "Lunatic Fringe" is so anti-BTC that it censors submissions containing any reference to bitcoin as well as banning IP addresses of said posters. 
I can understand the conspiratorial concern of one currency completing dominating all markets and creating a homogeneous currency, but shouldn't the decentralized nature of Bitcoin be an appealing characteristic to this group? The conspiracies that fly around that Jews control the world banks and have a hidden agenda don't accept a form of currency that would take this control out of these supposed "puppet-masters"? Or is it an instance of just twisting *everything* into a conspiracy, going as far as saying," The Illuminati created bitcoin as a way to control the general populace!"?

~~That may be true. I'm going to give it a shot; I'll report back with the result.~~ 
So I just tried to submit a post titled, "Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency" to their forum. Typed out a decent discussion topic being sure to include some conspiratory buzzwords - NWO, "Powers-that-be", you know, the usual - and had my IP banned instantly when I hit [submit](  
Apologies, OP!
