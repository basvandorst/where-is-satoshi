All of the private keys can be derived from a single set of seed words, unless you have a “25th word” in use, then you could have totally different keys. What wallet are you going to/from? How many words in the recovery phrase?

Any money (fiat) you have in it is. If your money is in coins on there, I don’t know how a real bank would insure such an asset. Yes, you owned 2.1 bitcoin, but at what price? What was the price when the coins got stolen or what is the price now? Much argument over such an intangible. So I’m not sure about that.

What language(s) will you be coding in?

Yeah once I tried to send $5 of BTC to someone and the fee was going to be $14. That doesn’t even make sense.

Yes, I promise you’re not the first person to discover arbitrage, lol... if there’s a way to make money, you can be assured someone is already doing it. :)

Sure. This will be of great help to you. Especially chapters 4 and 5.

Sad in this world that one can’t just be charitable, isn’t it? We have to always be on the lookout for scammers and cons. I know that personally, a lot of needy people have probably been denied help because I am wary and suspicious that everyone is a scammer these days. It really only hurts the truly poor and needy, and that’s a real shame. Good, kind hearted people have been taken advantage of for way too long.
So congrats, asshole scammers. You’ve made the world a shittier place, and your selfishness and greed is helping to create the suffering of those truly in need. You should be very proud, right? You’re so smart, you think.
But all you’ve accomplished to do is to trick other people into giving you something that you’re too weak and lazy to earn yourself. You leech off of those who are productive and successful, doing all the things that you could never do.
Easy to call it for what it is. They’re worthless. So, scammers: I hope you get the hell that you deserve.

Hey if we’re all just a simulation in a cosmic computer, then this might not be so absurd. A universe being born within a universe within a...
Fractals. Self reference. Reiteration. Infinity above and below. Gods creating gods creating gods.
Sorry, I gotta go now, I’m getting hard.

GDAX eats the fees for you. So you can send from GDAX to your wallet for free.

Hmm well they do say that verification takes at least 6-8 weeks. Don’t know that they give a specific time frame. I agree, that’s an absurd wait time but not totally out of the norm.

Look up KYC laws and you’ll get it. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 20:11:49
Yes. You can use those words to restore all of your keys to an BIP 39 compatible wallet. What about just creating a new wallet then send from the old address to the new?

I completely believe this. Look how everything functions as a part of a greater or lesser working system all the way up and down. Electrons orbit the nucleus of an atom, just like planets orbit stars. Different solar systems... different atoms.
Atoms form together to create elements, which form more complex chemicals, which form a functional system, such as a cell... and a group of cells function as a tissue, which function as an organ system, which has to work together in such a perfect way or else the organism dies. How do cells know that they are part of a living tissue? How do these tissues work as a more complex organ - without being conscious that they are a single part in a larger machine... how do these organs function as a synchronized, working body without even knowing that they are even carrying out a critical role in the support of that system? Humans, plants and animals are part of a planetary ecosystem - which compliment each other in such a way that they mutually support each other’s ability to live and function as a part of the greater system that they are a part of.
Gravity keeps planets and systems in check, while everything further up the ladder we just simply don’t understand- because we’re floating on a massive atom that orbits the sun, our nucleus... that interacts with other galaxies to form systems of matter an energy.
We fundamentally have the same objectives as a microscopic virus or simple cell- are created, we consume, we reproduce, we contribute to our system, and then we die. The next generation carries forth the traits and instincts that we have learned in our lives which we have built upon from the instincts and traits that we inherited and so forth, back and back and forward and forward.
These generic memories are written in DNA- code.
Do you realize the core of the universe is binary? Like a fucking computer?
DNA is made up of 4 nucleotides. A, U, G, T. Each of those 4 only will pair with one other. So you have a single nucleotide (1) that pairs with another (1) - which creates two pairs of two nucleotides (4).
Or cell division. It’s binary division. 
1 cell becomes 2, which becomes 4, then 8 and 16, 32, 64, 128...
If you’re a programmer or computer nerd you know that’s how the binary system works. Each bit is positional, each digit being 2^x power...
2^0 = 1
2^1 = 2
2^2 = 4
2^3 = 8
And so on.
Binary code shifts in powers of 2 and every value can be represented by a power of 2 combined with other powers of 2.
That’s how computers work. Why do dividing cells reproduce in the exact same exponential sequence as a binary number? Almost like the cell divisions are a clock tick. One value is a power of 2 greater than the previous number.  X(n), X(n+1), X(n+2)
And similarly, Fibonacci works in much the same way in that the next number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.
I could extrapolate this out and keep going... and bring it all together, correlate it all. And it actually makes sense if you understand the underlying math/science/existential truths. The things I’ve come to realize in my time would blow your fucking minds.
And no, I’m not even on acid, lol... I don’t need to be to see the rules and patterns that govern the universe. Neither do you all. Just pay attention and stop refreshing your coin portfolios for a second...  LOL

Good guess. Typically you’d be right, but I quit two weeks ago. The above was just good old fashioned grass.
The good news is I’m back to normal again. As normal as I get.

Oh shit! This guy know, dood! What we do now?!
-Stall. They can never find out the truth.
Truth?! What, that we make up tether? 
-We made nothing up. Tether is backed by our word. And also a few dollars worth of Siacoin. Also 3,720 Verge that I don’t have the private keys to. Or the public ones, for that matter.
Verge?? Huh? 
-Verge. XVG! Man... I really got fucked on that one....... IOTA bent me over and fucked me while it was watching itself fuck me in the mirror because then it could both see and feel it as well. Unforgiving coin. REQ was, let’s say... “downwardly aggressive” towards my portfolio..... Waltonchain. I knew that shit was fake all along– that’s why I only bought $250 worth, duh. Power Ledger. I felt this was probably gonna be huge until it failed to be huge...... Wow. How the fuck am I not homeless? Anyway- “Tether. It’s real because we say it is. And you have our word on that.” (insert the TM symbol here, I don’t know how to make one that looks like the ones on TV)
...TL;DR (I’m very high, sorry). If you’re reading this part it means you’re either very lazy or very not lazy... for the latter: you not only read my post, but you’re now also reading the summary of the post above. I appreciate your literary fervor. Whatever that means. I have no idea, I just thought it sounded good. I think I heard somebody on TV say it one time.
If you made it this far you’re the type of person that sits through the end credits at the theatre to see if there’s any extra content at the end. You are sorely disappointed 90% of the time. But the 10% of the time that you get it right, you’re stoked because you get to go home and tell all your friends about it and other things that they couldn’t possibly give a fuck about.
Just kidding. I love Easter eggs.
