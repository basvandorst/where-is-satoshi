The only way I would be able to get a 'transfer' through is if it like a transaction, a purchase. I could, if I wanted to, go and buy, on my debt/credit card, a €10,000 TV. I just can't transfer funds.  
  
So not knowing how bitcoin works, was wondering if this is possible with bitcoin?  
  
i.e. *buy* bitcoins, via debit/credit card transaction?

Yeah . . .   
Currently, not possible to transfer money abroad, not possible to draw cash locally either (aside from €60 a day - assuming ATM has cash).

No no, internet bank is working. You can transfer locally, just not abroad.

They are blocked from excessive withdrawals . . . not transactions.
