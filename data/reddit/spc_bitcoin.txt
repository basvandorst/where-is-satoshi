Users need to take the 5 minutes and learn how to make paper wallets or 20 minutes to learn how to do cold storage on external media. We don't need banks but education. I've seen many stories where gox customers either couldn't withdraw or were too lazy to withdraw their bitcoin. you can't regulate stupid.

it won't make a difference. 
for example, if a million bitcoin are being held or lost, nobody would know the difference. it would have no affect on price. Now, let's suppose several of the owners of the lost bitcoins suddenly decided to list them for sale at a really low price, to sell fast, that would affect the price. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 06:43:57
the blockchain.info app always adds transaction fee .005 and is not optional. the www site should be fee-optional. in the account preferences, you can set the default on fees, if you want custom, click on custom in the send page. not exactly intuitive.

The strange thing is, there are no memos on the block chain for the fake transactions. I see on my address the deposit, but the notification email contains a transaction id that is no good.

Before talking to him in the world Mark Karpeles grew up in Dijon. His mother tells the journey of this computer genius .
Send to a friend
The man who is now the most hated Internet has boiled teenager . A chubby face "geek" who scares anyone. And yet , this young 28 year old man born in Chenôve is now the target of all fantasies on the internet. Friday , after disappearing for three days , Mark Karpeles admitted to losing the $ 480 million that were stored in virtual currency on its site, MtGox . More than one million users have lost small fortunes in history.
A higher IQ than the average
If apologized , Mark Karpeles still remains in the sights of Japanese and U.S. authorities. The disappearance of that could be fraudulent . Nothing to worry his mother, contacted Friday and an impressive calm on the phone. "I know that Mark will do what it takes . If it is hidden for three days , it's just to gain strength and confront what awaits "says the Dijon now based in Switzerland . "And if he was really worried he would have called me . "
If Anne Karpeles talks about his son as if nothing had happened " for two minutes " that have lasted 15 , the scandal generated by Mark resounding . However , the course of Mark Karpeles is nothing that a highwayman able to disappear in a few days , as he did Monday. Born in Chenôve in 1985, Mark Karpeles lived his early years in Côte- d'Or, with his mother, a geologist . He attended school Chevreul , lives in the city center of Dijon and already passionate about IT. "I think we did our first program together, Dijon, when he was 10 years old. "
Because the boy is early . An IQ test diagnostic her intelligence above average. "But there was no effort at school ," laughs his mother, not stressed by the ordeals by his son. "I made ​​him do the cooking, sewing, sport, but he mostly hung with computers. " At the point of becoming a genius, even if Anne Karpeles not pronounce the word . " Admittedly, it is not bad in the kitchen either. By cons , it can barely sew on a button (laughs). " A computer genius who, baccalaureate - got to Paris , where his mother had moved - begins in an IT company in Paris . He left the capital a little faster, accused, according to our information , computer fraud. He moved to Japan , where he bought in 2011 MtGox . It is the platform number 1 of Bitcoin . Until February 7 , when the first bug , the site managed 80% of global Bitcoin transactions . Suffice to say it was worth a fortune. Today , Mark Karpeles , is accused by the Internet community to be incompetent - at best - or a crook. Nothing to worry his mother who , unlike his son, a young dad, kept ties in Côte -d'Or. "The last time I went to visit him in Japan, its website had been attacked . He solved the problem overnight , "says Anne Karpeles . "I 'm sure it will still succeed this time . " Before starting , a knowing smile , a lapidary : " And $ 480 million is what we see when playing with what states and financiers. "
For the background, see the little guy Chenôve now married to a Japanese attacked on all sides, Anne Karpeles expected. "The computer world is hard. And when we know how the Bitcoin angry central banks , governments , one can understand that my son disturbed. " At the point of today find themselves propelled to the front of the stage. Not bad for the former shy child the Rue Neuve- Bergère de Dijon.

Ponzis that sell return on investment, wild profits, etc. that does not disclose that it is a ponzi, is illegitimate and illegal. The thing with simpleponzi.com is it is disclosed as a ponzi, explains how and when a depositor gets paid, how much, and you can track deposits and payouts. Bernie Madoff's ponzi was illegitimate, and he went to jail for it. So far, I've gotten a payout for doge and bitcoin. Never send more than you can afford to lose.

if everyone who owned bitcoin (include alt coins) told the guv'ment to f-off we're not playing your game anymore we could truly have revolution. bitcoin is being co-opted by the regulation bootlickers, all the exchanges and walet-type services that use KYA and AML verification are sooner or later going to pimp the user info and transactions. you will be taxed, flagged, your accounts frozen. they will have control over your cryptocurrency. think bigger picture, not how wonderful it is to push a button and buy coin from your bank account.
