I wish that was true, but bitcoin is different than downloading music because it threatens the dollar. The Empire depends on a strong dollar which is why the Primary Dealer banks have recently made a concerted effort to drive the price of gold and silver down. If bitcoin stays at the level of acceptance that it has achieved, the state may let it be. However, if it continues to increase in value as measured against the dollar, it will also grow in popularity and it will signal the weakness of the greenback. If and when that happens, the Fed, the Treasury, the FBI and the Primary Dealer Banks will kill bitcoin. 
I imagine that you don't believe me. Just remember this conversation when bitcoin is declared a criminal enterprise and is closed down.

Bitcoin might survive if it stayed out in the fringes like Piratebay. If it continues to interest mainstream investors, it will be killed.

Your comments are the perfect endorsement for bit coin. As always you are at the vanguard of state-defense, armed with the slogans of servitude.

They have yet to invent the pretext under which they will destroy bit coin. As I said in another comment that have to uncover criminal activity involved with bit coin or they have to create that activity in order to produce a narrative about the danger of bitcoin for the herd. When you start hearing a narrative about the dangers of bitcoin on Fox and MSNBC, then you will know that the operation to quash bitcoin is underway.

Bitcoin will be useless if it has to hide like Pirate Bay

As I have said from the beginning..... If Bitcoin becomes a popular alternative to fiat money, the Empire will kill it. The Empire cannot survive without being able to control the world's money and the Empire is not going to play fair. Since the Empire can control the Internet, especially sites that facilitate trading, it will. And the Empire will kill bitcoin. The only real alternatives to the dollar are gold and silver.

Just wait and see.

They do not see it as threatening yet. As I said, if bitcoin continues to be a wonky thing among computer geeks, it will only face smaller hurdles from the government. It is only if bitcoin is accepted generally that the gloves will taken off and the Empire will reveal its talons

Anyone who is interested to know the state's opinion of bitcoin, please note the comments of the paid government troll jcm267. 
Bitcoin will soon come under the same kind of attacks that wikileaks has suffered. It will not survive. In the end, the only currencies that the state cannot destroy or control are precious metals

So far so good. When bitcoin's acceptance grows and its exchange value begins to reflect the weakness of the US dollar, bitcoin will be declared illegal. 
@_date: 2013-06-05 21:53:11
Sir, I believe that I understand the process and the problem. I'm not overly concerned about the audience.
A currency with no intrinsic value, has perceived value as long as certain conditions are met. Those conditions collapse rapidly if the currency is outlawed by the most influential government in the world. That government may not be able to stop all transactions and may not be able to erase your bit coins, but by making convertability illegal the government would kill bitcoins exchange value. Immediately

I open a gold bank account with ten ounces of unallocated gold. I am issued a debit card. I can buy anything anywhere with my gold account and the transactions will be paid to the merchant in whatever they choose - dollars, euros, Rupees, Renminbi, etc.

Do you understand that a successful, universally accepted bitcoin would reflect the inherent weakness of the severely inflated dollar? I am referring to monetary inflation more than price inflation although severe price inflation is inevitable after increasing the money supply faster than the economy. 
A successful and ubiquitous bitcoin would further weaken the dollar by offering investors an alternative to today's reality of zero interest on savings or very low return on highly risky investments. If the masses begin to accept bitcoin, the hyperinflation of the dollar will come sooner than otherwise. 
In other words, the people that run the US government, the Primary Dealer banks, the arms manufacturers and Big Pharma (among others) will not sit by idly and allow bitcoin to succeed. Bitcoin has the power elite as its enemies. Perhaps it doesn't seem that way yet, and if bitcoin is only really accepted amongst relatively poor computer geeks, they may leave it alone. But if investors start trading dollars for bitcoin, bitcoin will be destroyed. Period.

The Feds would just need to make convertibility illegal and shut down any exchange sites. Then they would make bitcoin itself illegal, meaning that no mainstream businesses could accept bitcoin as payment. Once the Feds do those two things, bitcoins utility is destroyed.

They are going a step at a time and they are still working on finding criminal activity that can be blamed on bitcoin, or if they can't find such criminal activity they will have to create it. 
One thing is certain, as bitcoin becomes more successful, the Empire's resolve to kill it will become unstoppable. Since bitcoin relies on Internet transactions among established companies and normal investors, the Empire will have enough access to shut down exchanges, jail some people and otherwise drive ordinary investors away. That will make bitcoin's exchange value plummet and then the lemmings will all sell out. 
It cannot survive a determined attack by the US Empire and it will be attacked.

Bitcoin is terrific and the dream is noble. A digital money that cannot be counterfeited or controlled by governments. It is a promise of personal empowerment and freedom and therefore it will be crushed by the Empire. In the long run the US government and the EU will not let it be successful. It is clear by the way that they manipulate the stock market, the bond and credit markets and the futures markets (especially gold and silver) that the big governments are not going to allow people to have an alternative to their monopoly on money.
You can say whatever you want about bitcoin’s security, you can hide its hosting or whatever, but when the US Empire decides to kill bitcoin, bitcoin will die. After all, killing is what they Empire does best

Yes it is still out in the open. 
I think bitcoin is a beautiful idea. It gives us an alternative currency that is not created and controlled by the government and massive banks. 
I study the government and massive banks. They will not allow bitcoin to be successful. They can't, because it would threaten dollar hegemony. Without dollar hegemony, the Empire comes crashing down. The Empire is not going to play fair.

You have to come out into the light to convert bitcoin into dollars or to take delivery of a product purchased with bitcoin. 
The Feds would just need to make convertibility illegal and shut down any exchange sites. Then they would make bitcoin itself illegal, meaning that no mainstream businesses could accept bitcoin as payment. Once the Feds do those two things, bitcoins utility is destroyed.
