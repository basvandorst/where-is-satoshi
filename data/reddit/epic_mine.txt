Careless increase in block size without first maximizing tx density is discouraged here.

.25% I believe and you can use your coinbase account to login as coinbase owns GDAX. The only time you should ever use coinbase is if you want to use a credit card or like paying those fees

And lucky timing

Can a lightning channel be imported from one wallet to another? Like if I have two wallet apps that both use LND, will a channel opened on one show up in the other if they both use the same seed?

Ya but I love crypto and mining! So going back in time and mining from the beginning would be more natural. Never played Powerball

  If you go back in time to replicate every crypto vulnerability, you put yourself in a paradox where you have always been the hacker hacker of every crypto hack. You can no longer tell yourself, "I am not doing anything wrong, since it was going to happen anyway." You would become one of the biggest assholes from your time. 
  Mining to my ledger silently along side satoshi and the other pioneers with cpus would be a cooler, more legal and moral way to get lots of BTC.

But you are paid more...

If you had a time machine could you mine to your current non segwit address on say a ledger nano, before you technically created the address? Or would you have to create a og legacy address?

My AI overlord can't be some 1 rack server, Reddit using smart fridge. If skynet on the other hand asked me to build it a body (mechanical engineer not computer science) I would.

Maybe "**with BTC equivalent included, assuming mass adoption**" would have been a more descriptive title.

But with minimum payouts and pool mining it still only matters when you sell
