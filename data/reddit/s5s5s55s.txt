@_date: 2017-05-26 21:53:22
I mine now so I don't have to put any actual money in.
@_date: 2017-05-02 11:08:30
I sold at that low under 200 mark lol. Lucky I rebought a day later at a loss. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:52:50
I kept them I'm just saying it was hard to watch that fall. I was scared it was going to $0. I'll know better next time.
@_date: 2017-05-14 06:30:33
Who fucking cares. Jesus people care way too much about stupid shit like this. Go outside. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 10:02:02
The elite don't have to hide it so no. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:58:10
I don't think so but will see. My money is on back to around 1k for a year or 2.
@_date: 2017-05-10 23:47:57
Women love to spend money not make it. 
Joke. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 06:29:32
Thank you Oh nastrodamous of bitcoin. What would we do without you?
@_date: 2017-05-21 19:41:33
Yes 2000 is closer to 2500 than prices lower than 2000. Math, how does it work? 
@_date: 2017-05-13 10:05:57
Was a joke. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 10:01:10
I'll hold your tears for you when it's back to 800 and you wish you sold high. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:53:51
Lol no I'm someone that road from $100 to $1200 and then back to $160.. I did not buy any at 160 I almost sold them all. The despair and fear is real.
@_date: 2017-05-11 05:11:46
Nobody has a sense of humor anymore. Go back to your Berkeley protests.
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:52:16
Problem is you won't want to buy when it feels like it's over.
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:48:11
I've picked the lowest point 3 times. I was the guy that sold at 160 during the last crash. Also sold at 970 after the etf news thinking I could Rebuy cheaper. It's hard man!
@_date: 2017-05-30 07:18:57
Ethereum has no hard cap of coins therfore it's a fucking scam.
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:30:23
Well I've broken even on the hardware already and except for summer months it's heating my house :)
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:39:40
It did 2 days ago and I bet you bought 0.
@_date: 2017-05-02 12:25:01
Man I would not go over 5%... 
@_date: 2017-05-11 07:28:24
Cry me a river Jesus christ. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 06:53:42
Excuse me but what makes your opinions so educated? Brexit is the best possible think to happen in the UK in the last decade. What about Russia as well? If you have fallen for Hillary Clintons damage control lies you are the uneducated one. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 09:59:00
This is wrong and has never been the case. As soon as it crashes nobody wants to touch it from a mile away. It will stay low for a long time and when it finally surges again everyone wishes they had bought low. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 01:36:58
It was a fun ride boys. See you at $500!
@_date: 2017-07-17 06:39:08
Lolol I'm gonna pee my pants. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 11:32:41
I don't agree. I think Bitfinix has caused all of this and it's going to pop hard soon. Of course I'm not selling cuz it would hurt to be wrong lol.
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:11:07
You and me are clones lol
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:34:32
Ya go to quad
@_date: 2017-07-29 05:00:18
You have no idea what you are talking about.
@_date: 2017-07-11 22:31:05
Fake news gonna fake news. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 06:51:27
This is a bit different when it was between him and Hillary. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 08:09:02
Wtf dude, leave politics out of here. Don't be a fucking history stalker. Fuck I hate assholes like you that think you are smarter than everyone else. Go suck on Bill Clintons rapist dick and watch CNN. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 01:38:39
Of course they won't say Hackers use leaked NSA tools to take down hospitals. It's bitcoin hackers take down hospitals. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 22:33:40
Sorry just 3 comments copy and paste but 3 different accounts it's hard to tell if bots Or a joke. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 02:32:10
Omg he supports the president how insane!
@_date: 2017-07-16 02:10:23
Drain your credit card to fund it. If it goes wrong default on the card. Can't lose. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 08:06:24
Yup then oil crashed.
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:53:41
This post adds nothing of value. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 22:00:52
