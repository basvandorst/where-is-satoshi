Kraken itself wouldn't be a channel, but would likely be party to many channels...
Let's say Coinbase, Kraken, and Local Bitcoins were connected via a channel, then transactions between the 3 of them would be instant and fee free... but it doesn't stop there... a meshed network of channels could enable routing across different channels.
For example, say you want to buy something from a vendor but aren't channeled... instead of opening a channel to one another, your transaction could go over a channel you both currently use (say Krakens for example).

Nicehash is a great resource.
There's nothing inherently unsafe from a security perspective letting your otherwise idle system work... but there are other considerations.
1) Electricity costs - do some calculations to make sure it'll even be profitable, assuming you pay the electric bill.
2) Component wear - this will shorten the lifespan of your GPU and possibly your power supply. Make sure you have a good, UL listed power supply, as a shitty one popping can quickly burn your house down.

If you can't eat it, use it for shelter, or burn it for heat- there's a chance of it crashing. All money is subject to what others value it at.
That being the case, yes, there's always chance of it crashing. On the other hand, it's guaranteed that *insertgovernmentcurrencyofyourchosinghere* will crash eventually. 
Don't mortgage your house, don't live paycheck to paycheck... Hense, the invest what you can afford to risk. Beyond that, there's no better bet for idle wealth.

To sweep is to basically put your private key into another wallet to bring the coins into it.
Where did you backup your phrase etc?

Is there anything you wish you knew or acted on, say, just 2 years ago? 
Now magnify that regret times a million... that's how you'll feel in 10 years if you keep that shit in fiat.

So instead of transactions between wallets occurring on the blockchain itself (and thus needing to fit into a block with a fee and waiting for said block), they occur on a "channel" which can later update the blockchain in a condensed way.
Think of it like carpooling to reduce traffic.

It would defeat the purpose of bitcoin if someone else could modify your transaction.
If your wallet supports it, you can add a fee.. or double spend with an appropriate fee so this transaction gets dropped.

Most importantly, it's not a scaleable solution and we're at a point where solutions must be scaleable.
It could alleviate some pain in the short term re: fees and slowness, but can also have a deleterious effect on node decentralization by requiring additional resources. 
2x would have been a fair compromise, had it been arrived at by the community and not a dictum by some companies.

Terrible, nonsensical analogy.

Bitcoin will replace fiat, therefore this has a long way to go.
Imagine that it's 1993, and you just learned about this cool thing called the internet. That's about where Bitcoin is right now, it's 1993 in Bitcoin years.

If you don't believe that crypto will replace fiat, stay out of it. 
If you do believe in it, then the "price" is of absolutely no importance right now.

This question has been answered countless times, do some reading.

Best time to buy is as soon as you can, the best amount is the most capital you can afford to put at risk.
Bitcoin is the future of money, dollars will be non-existant in the future. You're looking at exponential capital appreciation over the long term.

Did you happen to sweep or otherwise move forked coins recently?
