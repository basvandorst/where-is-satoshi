You're asking for something the crypto community doesn't want. Regulation.

Isn't it technically still legal for gold to be confiscated in the US over a certain amount?
I thought I remembered reading that in a different post a while back. It either is still a law or was repealed within the last 25 years

They weren't incorrect, just unethical as fuck. They don't NEED to give a date. People will just beleive what ever they see and buy on because someone famous did (in this case, ever in there life)

You say that like 
1)there's a direct correlation...which there isn't. 
2) like this hasn't happened before...in the last 5 years....
3) like the threat of government shutdown doesn't happen literally every year, they just sign an extension at the last second until they have a new budget to sign.
4)crypto isn't international

What is good will in this situation? People who didn't adopt crypto earlier automatically are doing it out of greed? Anyone who invests money and immediately loses 30% like they probobly did in the last day is going to be fucking pissed, check whether or not it's worth it to stay in, and probobly leave.
Just because they're not shills doesn't mean they aren't good willed (which is vague as fuck,  because you're implying they did something bad here)

I'm not concerned with the vocab. But, I attribute what u/rygerts did to being that 50 year old dad that walked into the living room where his sons are playing COD and trying to use "newer vernacular" to make him look cool, but achieving the complete opposite affect. IE. Dawg, Lit, Dope, etc...

The vast majority may be uniformed, but the entire community is full of greed, including myself. If crypto "hodlers" weren't greedy, they would be working more hours instead of obssessing over charts all day, or making stupid, *totally* original memes on a subreddit about their lambos 24/7.

I may recommend a veterans program in your country (where ever you are from) 
For the US, my recommendation would be wounded warriors project. I have known many guys who went through their programs, and I'm sure it would benefit them.
Even if you're against wars, there's no reason to let the men and women subjected to them suffer from their injuries.

From my understanding of tech, and you may correct me if I'm wrong, is the keys can be written and passed on paper possibly multiple times, and only be fully transferred during the "right time" the transfers over the blockchain isn't a very sneaky way of doing it. 
Same could be said if you took a wallet on a harddrive around I assume?
Edit: just thought of this too, yeah the exchange would be recorded on the blockchain, but what links that to any particular individual?

Thats IF they find them. The government isn't an all knowing entity, and due to their position, cannot legally operate outside of the law without risking the entire sting or case or what ever they're working on. so if they can't prove to a judge there was bitcoin used, the judge won't grant them a warrant to search and seize any property used.

Traders outnumber hodler holdings most likely by a decent margin in terms of btc owned/used

Xrp...really? That's one you chose to do better than every other alt? The one where a company made a coin to profit off of and pay employees. Yeah...that's the one that will succeed. You know, cause decentralized currency isnt literally the only goal of crypto lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:26:38
This game is literally based off of what people think it will be worth later on down the road. Implementation as a legit currency is a side thought to the vast majority...Everyone wants to be rich, and either the hodler or the adept day trader with billions of spending money is going to see that dream come true/er...anything in between at this point is chump change or a wash
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:22:30
That's what generally happens with any news station though. The only difference is they usually don't care if it's correct, and don't make and effort to substantiate any evidence
I dont know what country your from, but if it's wrong in American news outlets, but furthers their point, they do a massive correction sequence with an apology at 2 am when no one sees it,

Just because a someone's a doctor doesn't mean there a good doctor, just as someone may be a software developer, doesn't mean they're worth in the field. Assuming you're not bullshitting, what you may have in knowledge in software, you clearly lack in every other aspect of any economy.

True ripple followers who know the product (I say product because they basically sold xrp to the public to boost the prices and use the public as a test dummy for banks to observe) take it as a point of pride. 
They're not after decentralized currency, they want to hop on board the ripple companies product that's created for, and attempting to out the SWIFT transfers between banks.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:45:40
Well some random guy told people bch would be on coinbase a week before it did. I wouldn't doubt ripple/coin base employees couldn't keep their mouths shut, seeing as bch almost basically proved insider trading laws don't apply to crypto

I mean from my rather uneducated view of it, there seems to be loopholes. Using the blockchain for transfers, yeah ofcourse it's traceable, but passing keys on hardrives or paper wallets, although extremely risky for either party wouldn't be able to be traced through multiple transactions by hand.
Besides, the coins can be traced, but unless any info on the person could be observed through the wallet, or through the devices making the transactions, there is no way to link  anyone in particular to that transaction.
They don't call this shit the wild west for nothing.
Correct me if I'm wrong. Would greatly appreciate it

The only thing anyone has on Charlie is that he ditched his litecoin and didn't buy back. 
Your anger is misplaced my friend. 
Everyone has used coinbase at 1 time or another.
 Roger ver will be in prison more likely than anything. Your founder of bitcoin cash publicly said insider trading of crypto shouldn't be a crime. And will like be the sole reason crypto gets regulated. You piss off the wrong people who have actual power by manipulating 150billion dollars in assets, youre going to have a bad fucking time. If that doesn't tick some shit off in your head to get the fuck out of bitcash then you're wrong. 
You can't promote bitcoin cash and dislike coinbase at the same time. They go hand in hand.
Edit: gonna be honest, I really think I'm just being trolled

I fully understand their extent and determination, but it doesn't mean its not avoidable. 
Cash without a physical marker is hard to trace, why wouldn't a paper wallet or word of mouth threw multiple people be harder. the keys can disappear off of any network for long periods of time.
Hypothetically, person A is a drug dealer, person B is a buyer. 
Person A buys a hard drive from an outside party with no relation to person a, with keys on it threw a physical trade of cash, the last time those keys were in recognized on the block chain were with the outside party. Person B exchanges cash with person A in a physical trade, then person B sells it to another outside party, where the final outside party with no relation to A or B, trades them on gdax or some other exchange.
From my understanding of the tech, person A and B have zero connection to those keys besides eye witness reports, which unless there is a stakeout, the authorities have zero awareness of.
If crime was that hard to commit without being traced as you explain, then there wouldn't be crime, because the shit happens on a daily basis in the United States, and we like to think were good at cracking down on it. What about a country like Afghanistan with almost zero oversite.

Compared to other crypto subreddit I watch for news and updates, this one usually has the most vicious reactions to things they don't like (usually new people) and has the least amount of actual news about the currency, and usually sticks to memes in the top comments.
Xrb' s has the best actual relevant info that gets updated from my perspective

There would probably need to be a bill of sale type document for each transaction, essentially I guess you would just need to document everything.
Every time I talk to my brother about btc he says it's used as a currency you can't track for drug deals and crime, so maybe it's trying to limit this?

I can get a speeding ticket from a cop who had me on radar, but the ticket be thrown away due to a technicality. Does it mean I didn't do it? No it just means I was ruled not guilty.
Being found not guilty is different than being found innocent, and it's the first thing you learn in a highschool law class.
Just because the logs weren't used in court didn't mean he didn't do it.

Banks will see a huge influx of cash and report it to the irs. I believe any movement of 10k+ is what triggers some internal alarms in banks.
