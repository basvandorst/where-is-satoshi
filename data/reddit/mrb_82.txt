Hitbtc is a shitty exchange, better find an other one. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 10:22:59
They locked my icx now for more then a month. Each week telling soon you should be able to acces your icx. 
Worst exchange i ever used, if possible get your fund out ot theor!

Lol. No western media are reliable. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 13:49:05
So whats the diffrence between our western media? 
RT touches lots of interesting topics the western media dont report. 
And they are a lot quicker with news then our media. 
I like reading both, but find the news on rt more interesting most of the time.

Get a life.

Hitbtc is really bad exchange. They are keeping my icx coins hostage for months now. 
They never communicated this and each time i ask how long before i can pull my icx from exchange the always say soon. But nothing happens. 
If you still have funds on hitbtc i would advice transfer your coins ASAP!

This. They where just asking clients about it. 
They dont have an app and for now theres no plans to build one.

Hitbtc is the worst exchange i ever used. They locked my Icon for about 6 weeks now. 
So they are worthless now, support sucks 2. 
Avoid this exchange!
