If Bitcoin's price continues to increase, then the price equivalent of Bitcoin for those goods and services will likely decrease (subject to supply and demand). It wont have any effects so long as the price offshoot matches what people are earning.
For example, lets say this year I earned 5 BTC and the cost of goods and services account for 4 BTC of my yearly spend. In 10 years time, if the underlying value of BTC increases by 10x, my earnings will also reflect this. Instead of earning 5 BTC, I will earn 0.5 BTC but the prices of goods and services will also be less (0.4 BTC).
By the time we reach mainstream adoption the price offshoot will be minimal and stable enough that it wont have any psychological bearing on consumer buying behaviour.

I'm a good judge of character, based on three posts I know exactly the type of person you are.

Looks like you are an emotional trader, you will have your own set of problems to deal with.
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:28:22
You came here to get "advice" about what to do if people hurt your feelings.
I think that speaks for itself.
@_date: 2019-11-24 23:43:11
Why does it matter what they think?
If you go about life caring with the haters think, you are never going to go ahead.
Keep educating yourself and helping grow the industry and ignore/block those that hate.
That's what I do for most tribal communities also into this space.

The fact that the title emphasizes "Estonia" shows the click-bait nature of the author, who is probably of Estonian nationality.
Also, No he isn't.

MimbleWimble is just a mechanism used to solve the issue of fungibility. At the moment, Bitcoin transactions are not fully fungible, meaning you can discriminate between different BTC coins and we've see this happen many times in the industry. For example, recently U.S. OFAC had sanctioned three Chinese nationals and their cryptocurrency addresses (Bitcoin/Litecoin addresses) due to concerns of money laundering. MimbleWimble allows fully private transactions so that every coin is essentially the same so you cannot discriminate between coins.
The proposal of implemeting MimbleWimble via extension blocks just means that you can opt-in for fully private transactions, without changing the main-chain at all. So if you don't really care for private transactions, you can still use the main-chain as it is with fully public transactions. It's a win-win situation.

This isn't fake news. There is actual CP within the BSV blockchain. 
@_date: 2019-02-06 19:51:08
Does the article blame CSW? You said it was fake news it isn't. Just here to clarify your post.

Coming from a customer support background, as much as I agree that waiting times are annoying, you need to take into consideration that Binance has tens of millions of users and it was only launched in 2017. Even the biggest companies struggle today with many years experience. Binance has always had expectional support compared to other exchanges though but it is constantly growing and it is self improving.
Give them time to look into it, especially as its regarding your withdraw. I am sure it should get sorted out ASAP. That or you can submit a ticket and it will get looked into that way.
Keep me informed over how it goes.

What do you think?

That is different as Charlie Sold due to conflict of interest. He didnt have as much coins as Satoshi.
@_date: 2019-12-11 09:31:30
Why do we care so much about price? Do we ever talk about when the dollar or pound will reach it's all time highs? No.
If we want Bitcoin to be global money, we need to start treating it like one and use it. Otherwise, it will just ever be a speculative asset.
Go out and spend Bitcoin. My 2 satoshis.

Although I'm a big advocate of Litecoin, this post isn't really useful or adding any new insights.
We shouldn't be shilling our coin on the Sub.

Thanks for making me laugh.
I needed that actually 
@_date: 2018-12-08 04:10:26
I would do it myself but I don't have a wiki account.

Thats not what he said. He mentioned that they would like to fit crypto in their already established framework but are willing to expand beyond and create new rules for them.
@_date: 2019-05-04 10:31:45
Have you ever heard of first mover advantage?
All these newer coins will have to go through the same thick and thin that BTC has done, to get accepted on exchanges, merchants and get enough security. It's not easy, if that were the case then all these alt coins would have replaced Bitcoin by now :)
Bitcoin is and will always be the most dominant coin in this market.

I would save the money considering you're only 16 or at least spend far less as a % into Bitcoin. The general rule of thumb is about 10% of your earnings, but the market is still continuing to pull back and we've got Christmas and New year's coming so it's likely going to still keep falling. 
You've got university (which I'm assuming you are going) so you're going to be in a lot of debt as a student. You can always get a part time job to fund your investments into Bitcoin so that you can be self dependent.
We're still very early and if you've been keeping up with the recent developments the regulatory framework is still uncertain - so I would take this time to keep researching into the tech advancements and invest accordingly.
@_date: 2018-12-01 20:35:04
Agreed. We can all do our own part in "advertising" Bitcoin by spreading good word of mouth or helping fund marketing initiatives. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 20:29:52
Who knows.
@_date: 2018-12-01 20:27:28
Bitcoin unlike other asset classes are extremely volatile. To invest in Bitcoin solely because you would think you would get a nice return often leads to bad decision making. It's clear to me that you still need to research more into the overall aspects such as the legal ramifications and the tech aspects and work from the bottom up.

Can someone remove any references to 'Satoshi Nakamoto' on this fraud's wikipedia?
@_date: 2018-12-08 04:17:33
Anyone can edit Wikipedia

Roger Ver also thinks BCH is Bitcoin.
We must not trust everything we read on the internet, especially when it comes to Roger Ver.
There's only one Bitcoin and that's BTC.

We shouldn't be promoting irrelevant people.
Just my two cents.
