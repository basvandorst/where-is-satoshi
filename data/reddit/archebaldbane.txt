The issue is this is a block that is in the main chain.  So only my node dropped off while the rest of the network has continued on.
In addition, my node has the correct date and time and has not yet rejoined the main chain.
This makes me a little nervous (if attacking time servers would allow the network to segment or something.  I havent really thought this through) - do you think this is worth reporting as a bug?

It is now, yes. But at the time of receiving the block I'm not sure. It's possible it was wrong then.

That it is... Time for another reset
@_date: 2016-08-02 16:10:07
The correct time/date.  I checked.

Love it. The pipe full of holes would be a neat object to have too. The air of mystery.

Ok, I'll probably report it when I get home.  Its actually been stuck here since 2016-07-25 03:31:18. I'll grab all the logs and then try reconsiderblock.

Kind of light on detail or interpretation, especially in regards to routing and what the paper truly crystallized..

On the 21 business model, something I have been curious about for some time:
"...the software is very easy to get installed in places and then we think of that as something which over time builds a demand for large-scale hardware installations... ...so that's the thesis right now and we'll see what happens"
He kind of talks around it for a while. Not sure if he was trying to be subtly vague. Considering how clearly he normally speaks I'm curious if there is more to this answer.

Has there been indication that people are caching unmined transactions?
Miners might save fee paying transactions on the chance that there is spare block space.  Otherwise setting up a "nuisance node" which rebroadcasts old transactions when it sees the outputs again sounds entertaining at least. Conversely a service which reports whether it has seen the outputs spent before would also be interesting.

I have been cautious about linking my UTXOs throughout the past several years.  Unfortunately a significant amount of information is leaked when UTXOs lie dormant for long periods and then move around the same time. 
This has discouraged me from implementing better security practices, like switching to a BIP38 cold storage wallet.  To accomplish such a switch I would have to move all of my UTXOs to new addresses.  
Doing this would require crafting and storing signed transactions until broadcasting sporadically over the course of several months to a year.  The problem with this is canonical bitcoind transactions contain an indication of the block near which they were crafted. 
The alternative is to sign a new transaction every month or so, which requires many events in which the private key is exposed.
Can canonical transactions be made such that they are time invariant?  I would love to be able to sign a bunch of transactions and queue them for broadcast over months to a year.

FIBRE (and Falcon): ways to transmit blocks found by miners between nodes. FIBRE, UDP and forward error correction (minimizes round trips). Falcon, cut through routing (minimizes time between receiving and sending a block).
Lightning: A protocol allowing people to transact trustlessly many times before committing the aggregate movement of funds to the blockchain.
Flare: An approach for routing within the Lightning network. (Discovering the "six degrees of separation" between you and your payee.)
