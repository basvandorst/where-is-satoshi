Indeed. Why is


considered newsworthy?

It means lowering the risk of a loss and minimizing losses (they are inevitable, no one wins 100% of the time). That would be, for instance, setting stop limits on exchanges and updating them frequently if the price keeps going up.

Yeah sure. When you have nothing to say, it's now a joke.
Excellent combined use of backpedaling and ad hominem. If your goal was to embarass yourself, that is.

But if anti-bitcoiners don't have any bitcoin at the moment and believe it will only go down from here, they can't really profit out of it, can they?

Curious about this - did it help you spot some patterns? Were there any distinctions between the trades that went well on paper and those that did not?

While I agree that BTC is in a quite bad place at the moment, I am quite at the brand hijacking by  twitter and r/BTC. It's absolute cuntery

I gave you a completely different use case for stop limits - one that solves the issue you're presenting. I didn't say anything about day trading.
If "Tomorrow -493548%." is a serious concern then stop limits are the smart thing to do.
You're not setting stop limits because you believe BTC will go back up after a crash. That's fine. But when someone does the same with some alt coins, it's not? You're acting like BTC is the only reliable coin that will always recover.

If you're worried about that, stop limits are a thing.
You're like the nocoiners who still consider it foolish to get bitcoin because "it's a bubble". You're doing the exact same thing.

Wtf is this argument

For BTC to reach that price, dollar will have to be fairly worthless. So I'm not sure if it will be a big deal when it happens.

That's some good denial thinking for when you're at a loss but don't want to admit it to yourself.
No, they did lose for the moment. The cumulative value of all assets they own is lower than it was few days ago.

Not upvoting, I just want my lambos ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

No? Does that happen with any other currencies? The USD:EUR ratio changes frequently, but Europeans don't change their prices constantly in order to get the exact dollar value. Because EUR itself has stable value. Obviously Bitcoin isn't there yet and I don't know what it would take to bring it to that point, but I think that's the end game anyway.

"It will go up" -*(some guys)*
Stop jerking off your comfirmation bias.
