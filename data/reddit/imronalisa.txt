I checked for the archived addresses and the weird thing is that its not there. Im so confused and I thought I got phished but I for sure logged into the original site.
@_date: 2018-08-26 19:41:40
Yes I was certain. I logged in directly through the site.

I made a wallet on blockchain.info a very long time ago. I've made countless transactions, but I made a transaction yesterday and the funds have yet to be found. I have the link that shows the funds have been sent to the address I provided. Only problem is, when I look at the past addresses in my blockchain account, the address I provided is not there. I thought maybe my account was compromised or phished but I don't think thats the case.

All I did was go to [blockchain.com]( hit request, copied that address and had the sender send the bitcoin to that address. What is tx? Sorry for being such a noob.

Here it is. I know man, I feel so dumb. I need this money too and it just really sucks. Thank you I appreciate it

When I logged in again, a different address showed up. I tried doing the wallet backup, but the address I had the btc sent to was not there. Im screwed huh :(

EDIT: Deminero30 helped me out. I am truly a moron who should not be playing with cryptos. Sorry for wasting everyones time. GOD BLESS

basically contact support and ask here lol. Im pretty sure im screwed. The address I requested the btc to be sent to isnt even showing up in my archived addresses which is so strange because I for sure copied the address from the website last night
@_date: 2018-08-26 17:15:01
Yeah I know :(. Okay, I just thought I would ask. I think I just lost everything
@_date: 2018-08-26 21:28:38
nope. no coins to be found :(
@_date: 2018-08-26 21:27:16
I dont see anything in my wallet. I gave the sender the address to send the btc to
@_date: 2018-08-26 21:31:13
