This entropy stuff is not accurate. It is also not true that Bitcoin is finite for the same reason.
Virtually Infinite divisibility.
We can just find another decimal as unit of account.
@_date: 2018-05-29 09:44:13
And, while Bitcoin is infinite, it is not inflationary.
Those are not counter arguments.
What matters in Bitcoin is your stake of the network not the number of units. It matters that you never get diluted. They could airdrop 21 million more to BTC holders and nothing would change. It works the same as decimals.
@_date: 2018-05-29 15:24:26
Why would you assume I meant price would drop "that much". Might be as slight as 5% for example.
This is a protocol. It's usual for businesses to leverage infrastructure and standardization protocols at direct operational loss but overall profit.
Who is to say security won't be that valuable? Like negative interest rates for example.
It's shortsighted I'll say again. 
By big I mean usage, that allows for actual business cases.
Just imagine Lightning HUBs. If they are getting big business and Miners decide to drop security there could be indirect incentive to secure the chain at an operational loss. Even through mining subsidizing. It depends on a lot of factors. 
@_date: 2018-05-29 08:52:24
It's not apples.
It's bits. Information.
Adding decimals makes it infinite. It's more bits

@_date: 2018-05-29 09:52:49
Imagine that we decide to do an airdrop where every holder gets 2x his BTCs. Making it 42 Million total.
Would you think supply was not the same?
Unless there is "preferential" distribution, or minting, supply never changes. You can easily visualize this by considering supply = 100% of the Network. Regardless of # of units.
You can double, multiply, divide. As long as it is evenly distributed, which it is, supply is always the same anyway.
So albeit for apparently different reasons, I agree.
@_date: 2018-05-29 09:39:33
Units of account are conventions. 
What I mean is, 1 single Bitcoin in circulation can serve the same purpose as 21 million.
0.5 Bitcoin, same.
0.1 Bitcoin, same.
The value in any one unit of account is unlimited, and since it is infinitely divisible, any unit in circulation can represent the entirety of those 21 Million.
Bitcoin does not tend to "no circulation at all", because of this. Thus rebating the conclusion in the article posted. 
What you described above is not what happens though.
20 Billion USD value - 20 Billion Units in Circulation.
1 unit = 1 usd in value
Reduce circulation with everything else constant:
20 billion USD - 2 Billion Units in Circulation
1 unit = 10 usd value or 0.1 unit = 1 usd value.
This is the concept of burning. It doesn't result or tend to any stalemate like the author says. All the purpose and utility can be achieved by any single unit or decimal.

Mining power will not necessarily drop. Profit can be made by leveraging the infrastructure. Stakeholders and service providers might have incentive to mine at a loss to maintain security if we get big enough.
This view is shortsighted.
@_date: 2017-08-01 02:58:50
It was thoroughly expected, at least by myself. Nothing surprising really.
The only way to acquire BCC to dump is to buy BTC. With a lot of people wanting to keep their BTC safe, liquidity is less, thus price rises.
After the initial dump on BCC, most likely people will buy more BTC with it, somewhat keeping price stable. 
But some of the value will go back where it came from, to alts.
The real question is where those waiting out in FIAT will put their money. I think they expected cheaper BTC, I don't think that is likely though at this point.
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:24:39
It is not free. What is certain is, it will be more expensive for everyone who doesn't claim it.

I only buy with Credit Card.
I like to have them immediately in my wallet and no exchange is convenient enough in my country to tie up bank account or send any cash there.
For that, I accept a premium of upwards of 5% on top of the usual spread.
It has always paid off till now, I don't have to wait for bank transfers and I can buy on demand when I feel there is opportunity in the market.
Convenience and flexibility have costs.
If there were Localbitcoins sellers in my country though, I would probably use that.
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:42:22
Maybe not, but it doesn't matter. As much as the value of 1 coin rises, your respective part of a coin will rise accordingly. That is one of the reasons for so many decimal places. ��
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:31:49
Long term channels mean you can actually transact without ever owning a real Bitcoin. Right? If it's not on the main chain...
Miners will be dependent on Hub fees that open and close channels. Users will be relegated to LN Hubs. 
I don't know how to put it. Sounds like Bitcoin certificates to me. And much more open to centralization and collusion since users have little access to the main chain because of high fees... the barrier to entrance is higher, for users, not businesses.
@_date: 2017-08-01 06:22:36
If you were looking for the time to sell, it pays little to wait for after the fork given the uncertainty. You could win, you could lose.
Right now only one thing is certain, BTC is at ATH.
If I were wanting to realize gains anytime soon, now would be the perfect timing given imperfect information.
Myself, I am just holding until fiat is no longer useful. Unless I wanted to buy some tangible asset that is expected to hold some value (NOT A LAMBO).
@_date: 2017-08-11 10:57:01
There is a lot of manipulation and a lot of shitcoins to manipulate.
Unless you are inside this whale crowds, there is little gain in trying to time anything.
The way I play it:
Right now, pretty much all coins that have a decent use case are cheap. We haven't reached wide adoption in Crypto and for most coins, to be able to succeed in what they intend to do, they will need much much higher Market Caps to achieve it.
So basically, I just look at future utility and speculate on how big a market cap would be needed to ensure the utility of a given coin considering wide adoption.
If this value, compared to current market cap is high enough, I just buy and hold it and ocasionally rebalance the portfolio.
I.E. Bitcoin:
If you estimate 100 Million people would at some point hold a balance of 1000 dollars worth of BITCOIN it means Bitcoin's Market Cap would need to be 100B to accomodate this demand. So you can expect it to rise x2 in the future.
You can play with the numbers for different coins and use cases. 
This is how I try to do it. Little success in timing pumps and dumps.

Inflation occurs because of tiered distribution. Not because of Elastic Supply.
Only the last recipients, the commons, experience the real effects of inflation.
Inflation hinges on inequality and gatekeepers. 
If you increase the money supply by adding a 0 to everyone's bank account, it would do little for what they are defending and would also be an Elastic Money Supply.
So please tell it like it is Mr. Central Banker.
It is all about purchasing power really. Inflation creates artificial demand and gives the wrong incentives to the market making it more inefficient. The more inefficient the more value there is to be had.
In theory, Bitcoin is just as Elastic. It uses decimal places rather than 0s to the right. 
The only thing correct in there, is that inflation incentivizes spending. With Bitcoin, it can be done with deflation (as in general decrease of price of goods for exchange of store of value).
Price volatility is solved with adoption when in relation to the price of goods. 10x surge in Bitcoin will imply a /10 price in Bitcoin. I'd say that is pretty stable.
There is no chance volatility will be solved vs any fiat currency because fiat themselves are ELASTIC when it comes to money supply.
So if your endgame is fiat Mr. Central Banker, prepare for the volatility. We in the know are preparing for something different.
@_date: 2017-08-01 06:41:17
What you need is adoption. The fuel is never there with current users. And considering BCC is also priced in at this moment, it will probably take some time. 
SegWit itself does little for that. Maybe when LN comes we can see a serious rise with increased utility.
Until than, all you can hope for is probably coming from Alts.

High Fees / Low Volume = Tradeoff for security in small blocks Chain
Low Feees / High Volume = Tradeoff for security in Big Blocks Chain.

It's interesting that there is so much concern about November. 
In all honesty, I think that 2X will only be stopped on technical grounds. That means, if enough FUD can be spread about the team and software that is in charge of 2X. 
Because in theory, considering all the software would be top notch and equal quality, there is exactly 0 reasons why 2X wouldn't go through.
When there are cries about centralization of miners, it is ridiculous to then defend a 1X chain with exactly 1 "expected" Mining Pool, Bitfury. This will only be raised if enough FUD is spread over the software.
On another note, I agree with you this is mostly about East vs West. I have serious doubts that so much of this FUD would be there if the main Miners were western and not Chinese. Chinese are expected to act maliciously, while Westerners are expected to act incentive based. I think this served a good line to promote some Governance shifts that SW + LN + small blocks bring about.
Also, do not underestimate the Chinese capacity to pump something. I am buying all the BCH I can counting on that really. I am a Westerner living in Asia, my experience tells me we are in for a surprise. Let's see if it plays out. :) 
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:20:08
But You can have Big Blocks with LN and SW. Or big blocks with LN.
There is no need for an artificial limit on blocksize. You can argue this centralizes Miners. But I am much more worried to be barred interaction with the main chain because of high fees from small blocks and be forced to go through an LN Hub.
Miners will then be dependent on a smaller number of LN Hubs then there are users. LN Hubs will have the power and are another intermediary between me and the main chain.

The best thing is you only need one payment channel to a HUB that will act as your bank and direct your payments though their channels because they have more costumers thus more connections to make sure your payment reaches the destination.

Anyone can run an LN channel is not necessarily true if you have high fees on main chain because of artificially scarce blockspace. 
It will not be a choice for the masses to avoid dominant channels.
I would agree with you if you have all this + Big Blocks. Otherwise it's just bullshit you are being sold to promote a governance shift from Miners to LN Hubs. Which will be harder to control cause forking Bitcoin with side chains won't be that clean.
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:48:48
I was expecting that too. But this recent surge to me is an indicator that people want to dump BCC/H and get more BTC.
I reason this because if you want to dump BCH, your only option would be to buy BTC. I find no other reason for the price to surge like this under uncertainty.
The real question is: will BCH be dumped for BTC or Alts?
@_date: 2017-08-11 11:46:29
I think Bitcoin is made in such a way that you have the liberty to code anything. And everyone has it too. And the chain will follow the code that is ran. 
I think a lot of people don't know how to code, so they defer their trust to developers. It is expected and it is ok. What is not okay in my view, is that developers, rather than executing on Users and Miners "wants and needs", have themselves a "want".
And I think it is worst for developers to centralize around a single implementation, than it is for miners to centralize around a single pool. For the sole reason there are no incentives to keep developers in place. And if there aren't other implementations to keep the main implementation HONEST, than we are just deferring to TRUST which is exactly what Bitcoin incentive system is meant to overcome.
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:37:33
I believe that too. But while LN fees will be low, main chain fees with small blocks will have to be high to maintain hashrate.
What I mean is, you will only be able to use LN. Mainchain will be left to big settlement.
What this means is that it is theoretically possible to transact bitcoin without ever owning one. :).
You buy your BTC for fiat from an LN Hub. You have a permanent channel. And you sell back to them when you are finished. Effectively, not ever having to settle the channel on the main chain. Thus, not ever owning a Bitcoin.
The problem with this for me, is because main chain will have high fees, regular people will be relegated to using this bank like process, which effectively shifts power to big LN Hubs. Seems to me like a new breed of banking and a little attack to what makes Bitcoin so powerful, Ownership.
That is the sole reason I am against an artificial cap. It just hands over the market to LN Hubs rather than letting them compete with Miners for transaction processing. Competition is good for users. And I seriously think it is much easier for Banks to centralize or collude than Miners who are working against each other in a Winner takes all.
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:44:43
Without Miners there is no Hard Fork. Considering this is a Hard Fork proposed by Miners, I expect the hashrate to move first, otherwise there is no Fork. ��

You are underestimating the cost of LN.

Considering 1X supporters have been crying for Miner decentralization, it will be interesting to see how they will support a chain with one expected mining pool behind it, Bitfury.

This is what I have been claiming in my 2 week history as a redditor.
Bitcoin as Gold or Cash is a false choice and a losing one. Because without the cash utility, there is no value to be had to store.

For big size buys, it's actually easier to ensure that who you are dealing with isn't a scammer.
For small size, it pays little for either party to do due diligence and increase costs of transaction. For bigger size, I suppose you can just call them and ask for assurances since the size of the buy can justify the bureaucracy of protecting your investment. 
Maybe they even fly out to meet you given sufficient volume.

Not literal.
Like a bank account. IOU but backed 1:1.
What happens when LN Hubs collude or get compromised and we decide to fork the chain to defend ourselves? 
From my point of view, please correct me if I have some flawed understanding of this, With FULL BLOCKS (high fees) Bitcoins Will naturally flow to LN Hubs who will be those with capital to settle on chain.
You will then be "forced" by high fees, to transact through LN Hubs who provide liquidity off chain. This slowly makes Bitcoins Gravitate towards LN Hubs, while we are left to transacting balances.
Since the balances are kept off chain until you settle channels, but settling is expectably expensive, you are incentivized to not settle and just use LN like a banking account.
If you don't settle on chain and there comes the need for a contentious fork, whose Bitcoins are those? Does this not affect Ownership?
Furthermore, settled Bitcoins will be more expensive than unsettled ones (cost to settle). Does this not affect fungibility too?
Do instant transactions justify such power shift as I understand it? Not to mention Miners will be fundamentally held at ransom by a lesser number of costumers (LN Hubs) than otherwise would be.
And when users and Miners are separated by an intermediary that controls both, I don't think it's good news.
I would be glad if someone could provide a different set of consequences for articially High Fees on the main chain.
For now, I will keep all my Bitcoins exactly where they are for I foresee they will be worth a lot more than the balances used to transact.
I would absolutely love all these solutions if we were not barred by high fees (artificial scarcity of blockspace).
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:17:31

Kraken will award BCC. It's expectable that their liquidity is untouched.

@_date: 2017-08-01 16:26:31
Sorry, you are missing some economic incentives.
Miners will not Mine the chain where they took the transaction processing business from them in exchange for nothing. High Fees is the tradeoff for Security. While difficulty in accessing the main chain is the tradeoff for your so called decentralization.
You are free to make that choice. Such is the nature of Bitcoin. I just disagree with it because I dislike Banking and even more so Lack of Ownership. At least with Miners you can more or less easily fork the chain if they misbehave (which I dispute there is incentive to do so, I even dispute there is incentive to centralize), whereas with LN Hubs, you can fork, but who really owns the Bitcoins?
There is a major major governance shift here IMHO. And it's not to users.
Who really owns the gold?

I agree sat/byte is what is important.
But transacting in Lightning is not the same as Transacting on Main Chain. You have to know that. With Lightning you are getting Bitcoin certificates, not Real Bitcoin.
When comparing both main chains - Big Blocks will offer lower fees. Guaranteed.
Relegating yourself, not by choice, but by necessity off high fees, off chain, will promote a Major Governance shift and Lack of Ownership.

The mempool is near empty. Fees are low. Those are the benefits of NON FULL BLOCKS.
The whole concept of small blocks + LN + SW hinges on the fee market. You are supposed to get full blocks and high fees on main chain if those are the solutions you want. 
Even though your post is written like 3 hours before a major fork. So, it is hardly indicative of how the mempool will be under normal conditions.
And why are you so happy for LN if the mempool is empty and fees are low? Isn't it supposed to solve exactly that?

History is a pretty negligible statistic in this realm. 
Furthermore, the chain that hardforked in that example was the Majority chain making it much easier to sustain both chains. 
I think it is dangerous to use it as a testament to what will happen here. 
Nonetheless, considering that to dump BCH you need BTC, and that is shown by a surge in BTC price. To get BCH you need fiat, as you would be much better off getting it directly from futures or buy after a massive expected dump, the 7B USD out of the market also can give some indication as to this.
So although I think both chains will be sustainable mid term, it's hard to reason that convincingly.
If they should be, I think BCH will overcome BTC (considering the current roadmap) in the long term. It is just sounder money really.
Myself, I will be holding both from start, and buy BCH after the dump.

No. I would argue they had undue influence as "developers".
I think Bitcoin is the ultimate freedom. And I think it empowers Users who know how to code. That said, the incentives are there for whoever has skin in the game. So I think defining developers as a separate group from users was never meant to be the case.
There are no inbuilt incentives for "just developers". This makes it the easiest group to compromise and least costly to do so. 
And also, they are the only group that you have to trust not to act maliciously. There are also no inbuilt punishments.
You should not view developers as a power group. It is contrary to the Game Theory IMHO.
Developers are just there to put in practice the ideas of users, miners, and economical actors. They should have no seat in the parliament because they have no skin in the game.
@_date: 2018-06-14 05:43:23
No. It wouldn't.
It would be around 2016 blocks which at the same difficulty and a lower hashrate would take considerably longer than the two week average.
This would eat into miners and create a death spiral. Possibly stopping the chain for all intents and purposes.
The fact that difficulty is predicted to rise in 5 days and that hashrate is not adjusting to price tells me someone knows something I don't.

We are talking about profitability. Not absolute hash power.
What his ensures is that both chains will be equally profitable to mine thus no chain will be orphaned. And both will tend for 10 minute blocks.
Miners will return because BCH will get too difficult too fast, reaching profitability parity. Hashrate however will be distributed according to price ratio. It is not a 50-50 split I am talking about.

Yes. 
And further divisibility Will probably be a must due to other reasons.
We have been saying for ages that people need not worry of not enough Bitcoins existing because we can add decimal places. I suppose by 2140 either we failed or we will surely already have extra decimal places.
Even so, it would by itself work as solution to halving rewards. So one way or another I think it's too early to make such a huge bet on how reward dynamics will work and therefore to commit ourselves to an artificial fee market so soon.
Oversold arguments are only good to push agendas.

It is not a problem that has to be solved. It is a problem that will already be solved off chain. In what regards to the main chain, it is working exactly as intended, therefore, not a problem. After all, this is a store of value, not a payment network.
If it was such an urgent problem, raising the blocksize would solve it immediately.
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:01:08

I think you have to think in percentage of wealth and not number of people. 
If the 1% richest on the planet get in first, the curve will be much closer to the top than if adoption starts with lower capital.
So we can say only 1% of people have Bitcoin right now, but how much money does that 1% have in comparison to the remainder 99%? What is important for growth is capital. 
That said, I think we are still in innovator stage considering the Market Size that Bitcoin could overtake from current alternatives to its use cases.
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:18:19
Actually no one knows. Anyone that is saying what will surely happen has a crystal ball IMHO.
The incentive dynamics are too variable to make a real argument. But several things might happen.
1. Miner rewards will never end, they will just get halved every 4 years. If Bitcoin price keeps rising and cost of mining falling it is possible even such low Block rewards are enough to maintain profitability for Miners.
2. Bitcoin price stagnates, miner reward keeps halving, the off balance will have to be covered by either:
                 A) fees
                 B) transaction volume
                 C) cost of mining falling dramatically
It's a moving target dependent on several variables. That is why sticking to a decision to solve that right now reduces our possibilities to adapt in the future.
You cannot mess with:
Transaction volume (the higher the better to keep options open)
Fees (they should only rise when Block rewards prove insufficient)
The present roadmap might well be the solution needed in the future, right now it's just cutting options from the table.
Either way, I will not argue because as is layed out right now, the fee dynamics and the need for full blocks pretty much ensure a self fulfilling prophecy that you need fees to incentivize Miners. So for those who cannot think in abstract, empirical evidence will make them think there was no other way and they were right all along.
Let's see where this takes us.
 
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:55:28
Thank you for your reply:
1. Yes, the current scaling solutions arguably create a need to bribe Miners. A point could be made that sufficient volume can cater for fees all around. However, if you do not limit accessibility to the main chain there would literally be no use for off chain solutions. I expect that before we arrive at a problem 100 years in the future, maybe we will have better solutions. Exponentially raising blocksize might even be feasible with exponential technology advancement. It is not feasible now, but really, this is a problem 100 years in the future.
2. I expect the fee dollar value to rise insanely big as the dollar becomes insanely worthless and Bitcoin insanely valuable. The reality is, given desirable (end game) exponential rise in price, Miners will get exponentially rewarded, even if fee satoshi/byte stays the same forever. I actually argue it should decrease over time as energy gets cheaper, technology gets spread, storage space cheaper and Bitcoins value rises (satoshi/byte). 
3. Yes it will. And will guarantee decentralization, lesser fees, higher rewards, 
It is a very complex discussion that involves a lot of future variables that literally no one can predict. So instead of trying to predict the future and most likely getting it wrong, I think we should focus on present problems.
And this is the reason I think the system is being gamed. Deciding this now is either a stupid leap of faith or an ingenious roadmap for takeover. I lean on the latter.

As long as distribution is tiered, there would be no difference.
Your salary would be lower because your money doesn't inflate. Goods would be priced lower because money doesn't inflate. The ratio would pretty much be the same as now, only instead of 100 notes we would be using 10 notes. 
What we have to combat is tiered distribution. Wherein a central bank can print new coins and sell them at old coins value before anyone notices that there is too much in circulation. Debts should be collateralized accordingly. And fractional banking has to die.
Right now when you buy new money (debt) you are paying being priced as if it was valued like old money, and still being charged interest.
Deflation will not solve this, only a complete review of the financial system will. 
The simple printing of coins is also not a problem. This is actually what Bitcoin does. But it is distributed equally. Imagine when Bitcoin is worth too much, or needs more units, you simply add a decimal place, TO EVERYONE. Instead of distributing by tiers and losing future value down the chain where those closest to the source control more of it.

Been saying a long time. For people to be incentivized to spend Bitcoin, as a good store of value, an asset has to be priced at a discount if you are willing to pay in Bitcoin. 
Otherwise you might as well utilize other worthless currencies.
Like in business you also get bulk discounts, ready payment discounts, everything that circumvents loss of future value gets you a discount. It's just amazing how this doesn't happen when paying in BTC. Every time you spend it you are paying advanced interest.

No. That is not. And it's a major misconception IMHO.
Gold holds value because it is extremely useful for a lot of endeavors and scarce.
Art holds value because of it's place in history. As many collectible items. 
Both are scarce and presumably durable, so you expect them to be there in a hundred years and still be useful or historical.
A good stores value because it is expected to be equally useful in the future and it is not infinite in supply. So you can be confident that the supply tomorrow will be less than today and demand is the same or higher, and thus, your good appreciates. The other reason is the good you are measuring it against (USD) depreciates (increases in supply), and thus, more of that good Ian needed to buy it (this is the case of Real Estate).
So no. There is literally no good in the entire universe whose sole property is "Store of Value". If it's not useful it has NO VALUE.

I always buy with credit card. I have 2 month interest free. By the time I paY them my dollars are worth less.
Depends on your credit cards conditions though. To me, it allows me to antecipate my investment by 2 months.
Also, I always buy appreciating assets with fake money while keeping the real one to maintain liquidity for eventual opportunities. Just make sure you can pay it off whenever it starts being unprofitable (i.e. interest rates &gt; capital gains).
Although I am most sure that any financial advisor would advise you to the contrary, so don't take my word for it. It depends on each persons risk profile.
What you should never do is buy any depreciating asset with credit. I.e. Cars, Holidays and stupid shit.

If you make the charge big enough. The opening and closing might not really be a choice for some people.
And if you are talking about incentives and free market, the first step is to take down barriers. If you are artificially limiting blockspace, your point is moot. Because you can artificially restrict most choices then. Just make Fees high enough and people will have to go through some service to open and close and not by choice. They will also have to abide by the "laws" of that service because they have no choice.

It's an interesting idea, but how would you guarantee fungibility.
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:34:08
Because difficulty adjustments in BCH would quickly adjust higher as well.
Yes, this algorithm protects BCH, but if situations were reversed it also protects BTC. It takes 144 to correctly pair the difficulty between chains, and it is gradually adjusted each block, so really, in less than 20 hours BCH would be on equal profitability with BTC however high the price might rise (not counting fees which rise with backlog). 
BTC's difficulty adjustment is pretty irrelevant for this war as BCH just indexed themselves to equal profitability with BTC. So yes, both chains will always have Miners unless there is a market sell off and hashrate will mostly be allocated by price ratio (adjusted for fees).
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:58:08
There is actually a much simpler explanation:
BCH's recently introduced difficulty adjustment algorithm prevents a death spiral as profitability of mining both chains will always and faster than before tend to parity. Virtually guaranteeing hashrate for both chains.
The only death spiral that can happen is if everyone decides to sell, which I don't figure will happen anytime soon.
BCH put in place the mechanism to prevent an attack on BTC while protecting itself from the Miners jumping back and forth. It would do well to acknowledge how good a solution it actually was.

Oh, make no mistake. I am keeping all my banker coin (BTC). For sure it will be the most valuable given the path it is taking is pretty similar to the mess we made of gold already.
I am however talking about future development too. Solutions like Lightning as is, and Sidechains, and whatnot, really create the infrastructure for banking takeover. Furthermore, the high fees or block space scarcity virtually guarantee inaccessibility to the main chain for common folk. Low value payments will get better, you will pay with some shitcoin backed by BTC and issued by Lightning Banks who will provide the service of opening and closing Chanels for you since you won't have money for the fees. The world will be their oyster. They can pretty much target off chain off side chain clients too with their services o. Their behalf. Fractional banking is possible again albeit those in the know are guaranteed their coins. So much for everyone else.
Now, if they manage to get a lot of clients, they might not even need to open and close so many channels because they can settle accounts between themselves rather than with each individual user. 
One thing is for sure. Bitcoin development will really push the Clearing House technology years ahead. It is a fantastic use case albeit not the one I was really hoping for.

I'd say it would be much healthier to compensate them with transaction volume with lower fees rather than lower volume and higher fees. 
Also, if you start this market today while there are still Miner rewards, you will arguably create a Miner expectation that the fees+rewards will have to balance themselves from this point on, thus starting out much higher than needed and creating a fee market much earlier than necessary.
But then again, when you are trying to create new fee charging services it makes sense that fees have to start high otherwise the need for those services wouldn't be there.
This is not healthy in any economic angle you chose to look at it from, and no, we should not get used to it. But sheep will be sheep and will get preyed upon every time. Just glad we streamlined revolution with BCH for the next time we have to revolt against this kind of nonsense.

That sounds perfectly in line with the non written spirit of bitcore. It just doesn't fit with the vision I was sold. 
Good luck with adoption. Instead of targeting the individuals who would benefit the most and would ensure user decentralization you are targeting the smaller number of use cases the can afford your fees. So much for decentralization. Isn't that the tradeoff you were trying to sell?

Over the weekend we did not have this DAA in BCH.
I already conceded in another post there might be a threshold when this is theoretically possible. 
But since I believe this threshold would imply difficulty and Miner allocation to START more than 90% in favor of BTC and suddenly switch for no reason to a less profitable chain, I am deeming it practically impossible albeit theoretically feasible.
Also, difficulty in BCH adjusts every block thus, as soon as Miners move it would quickly start rising. This switch and spiral would have a limited timeframe to work. About 20-30 hours. The difficulty period of BTC is hardly a variable when you are looking at these timeframes. 
This would have to be an enormously concerted attack and the execution would need to be quick and flawless with no one fighting back. 
I firmly believe this threat scenario is highly highly unlikely if not at all impossible.
Since I have no mathematical proof either way, I would be very interested if someone more knowledgeable could come up with some numbers and prove either possibility.
As I see it right now, unsubstantiated FUD.
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:20:40
BCH's recently introduced difficulty adjustment algorithm prevents a death spiral as profitability of mining both chains will always and faster than before tend to parity. Virtually guaranteeing hashrate for both chains.
The only death spiral that can happen is if everyone decides to sell, which I don't figure will happen anytime soon.
BCH put in place the mechanism to prevent an attack on BTC while protecting itself from the Miners jumping back and forth. It would do well to acknowledge how good a solution it actually was.

Depends on who you want to cater to. If fees are sufficiently high for low remittances, you will need western union type of services for average people.
This high value remittance is a use case that will cater to the same old people that are already catered too by our current financial system.
Yes, it's faster. Yes, it's cheaper. Yes, it's more secure. To those who can afford it.
You are creating a paradox by keeping blocksize low in order that Joe Schmoe can run his Alaskan raspberry pi while at the same time telling Joe Schmoe he can't afford to make any transactions and thus thank him from propagating those from people who can at a loss for him because even power has a cost in Alaska.
Sounds like the rich will get a better financial system ran by a few idiot fanatics at a loss to them while adding value up the chain.
So yes, Bitcoin is still a good technology and a good competing service for high value remittances. One that can make the rich richer. 
And they will not be ceased by the IRS. I wonder who will pay taxes when some have unceizable assets while you have to go through a KYC Lightning Hub to make your puny transaction.

I found this argument quite reasonable with both the benefits and shortcomings. I do not know the author, just did a quick search. 
Both deadalnix and Peter Rizun spoke about it in the future of Bitcoin conference and I found their arguments quite compelling as well.
Myself personally, I have no quarrel with SegWit technology because I don't even understand it fully. 
What I have against it is it's intent in facilitating a roadmap I most definitely do not agree and for which I have yet to see any kind of economic or mathematical proof of the underlying assumptions that are conducent to it. The way I foresee it, I oppose it. I do not trust engineers in Bitcoin to do Engineering at face value, let alone Economics.
Also, not being an engineer, and not trusting the engineers by default, I also think barring an upgrade to somehow "confiscate" my non SegWit address by rendering it obsolete or unspendable, I prefer to keep it "Legacy" until SegWit is proven safe on a decent scale and I certainly feel a lot of other actors are exactly doing that. 
And so I believe that it should be opt in.

Buying on credit according to your income is often a good decision. 
You antecipate your spending which gives you a higher value for capital than what you then payoff with less worthy value (as inflation eats away at dollar value) and as BTC price rises (usually).
So I buy now what a dollar can buy me, and pay later at the same rate with dollars that are worth less. It is important to also say that I don't take long term debt for this and I don't take credit that accrues interest.
My credit card allows me almost 2 months without interest for example. I use it often to buy BTC.

Please explain why fees alone won't be sufficient reward?
It really depends on:
1. Volume of transactions
2. Price of Bitcoin
3. Cost of mining
I think it is safe to assume the following:
1. Volume of transactions will rise exponentially
2. Price of Bitcoin will rise exponentially
3. Cost of h/s Will decrease
All of these concur to increasing transaction fees.
The real problem arises when you increase fees while Mining Rewards are still distributed. Because Miners will expect this balance to maintain itself eternally and thus expect fees to rise as much as rewards fall which will make you pay more than sufficient reward.
There is an optimal number for this equation which I do not have the means to arrive to, but I am pretty sure a versed mathematician could come up with an accurate formula and simply prove what is the optimal balance between fees and rewards.
I am pretty sure it's not the one we are at. And I am pretty sure there will be no problem whatsoever with Mining rewards in an age of renewable and essentially free electricity which will also concur to decentralization.
This is hypochondria at its best and only serves a limited number of interests in the present day.
The current high fees are essentially a bribe for miners to keep securing a system about to be gamed for good.

If you had the unconfirmed transaction in your wallet I can't guess why they would go to another wallet later. Do you have an address? Did you check blockchain.info for the sender's address to check where they went or if they ever left?

Replay protection doesn't matter if the majority doesn't Fork. Think about it, when I use my BCH I don't give a shit if my Bitcoin Clashic is replaying that transaction.
Unless I have interest on both chains, which I don't.
And my Clashic will never be replayed on BCH because I simply don't use Clashic. So while it's funny and a good laugh, there is really no risk from Clashic or any other on this front.
Chain reorg is different. Although I find it highly unlikely that a minority chain can ever be that with more work without serious Miner support.

I could be wrong and stand corrected if proven wrong, but you are clearly misunderstanding my point.
It is true that given the same difficulty, the highest priced coin is going to be more profitable.
However, since BCH quickly adjusts, its difficulty would increase enormously if it ever got 99% of the hashrate. So very soon after, starting at the same difficulty, BCH's difficulty would adjust much higher, thus bringing profitability back to BTC, regardless of BTC's adjustment.
This is how I understand it. They are pretty much tied up now. Only the Market itself can decide to crash BTC to 0 now.
There is probably some threshold where your case would be correct, but intuitively I would say that threshold, given fast BCH difficulty adjustment is pretty hard to reach at this point. BTC's difficulty would have tô already be very high, meaning that majority hashrate would have to switch in less than 24 hours for no reason whatsoever. And BCH difficulty would have to be very low to begin with to accommodate this switch in time for a death spiral.
Honestly, I think there is a theoretical threshold but I think it is pretty extreme. I am will to go out and say we need over a 90% sudden switch for now reason from the most profitable chain to the least profitable. But I did not run he numbers.

@_date: 2017-11-14 11:10:37
I could be wrong as well, but in that case what I think will happen is that BCH difficulty just gets insanely high if everyone mines it, rendering it unprofitable and making some Miners, albeit few, return to mining BTC.
The tendency with this algorithm is distribute hashrate according to price ratio.
So if BTC is 1% of the price, it will get 1% of he Miners. It will only stop if the market values it at 0.

It's called competition. If a western miner could mine in China, due to a better profitability ratio, he would, and he wouldn't be demonized for it. The problem people have is not geography, it's Chinese people unfortunately.
I bet the same shit would be thrown around if some Chinese guy bought a warehouse in Venezuela and started mining there.

Impairing the profitability of Chinese miners is the same as subsidizing the inefficiency of western miners.

Certainly you know that artificially preventing efficiency is the same as applying a broad tax on all holders to subisidize Joey's Basement Mining Operation?
Everyone will be able to mine but everyone's Bitcoins will be worth less than they could be under the same conditions and better efficiency.
Specialized mining provides value to holders, while non-efficient mining just taxes it. Everyone would be better off mining than holding. And those poor guys in third world countries who can't afford the GPU, they would be fucked on both sides.

I was actually wondering how do you gauge community consensus (not just miners).
Is it through applause? 
I would say it would be through a hard fork and let the economic majority vote. But that seems to go against the spirit of that poll.

This is starting to seriously turn into racism...
"I wouldn't trust a Chinese ... whatever"
Would you trust an European under same conditions? Would you trust an American?
This is a system designed for distrust. You should distrust everyone. Stop singling out the Chinese already.
Please be logical people. Distrust is the default. You do not have to provide reasons to distrust, let alone racist reasons. 
It is for trust that you have to provide them.

Wow. "Refusal to do so is obstruction of justice." - said the congress majority. 
Soft Forks or Hard Forks or any forks are always a choice for Hashrate. Developers propose, miners vote on it and the users attribute more or less value than other options. 
I think in your head you already changed consensus rules.
Running a UASF node is like signalling intention. Participating in a sit in. It's ok as a demonstration. But the real vote is where you put your money at as a user. Misrepresenting this reality is not empowering anyone.

Miners and users keep each other honest. Not Miners and nodes. 
Miners and users have a symbiotic relationship.
As a node you increase connectivity, which is great. But Blocks are rejected according to Miners consensus. Not user nodes.
User nodes, at the maximum, Signal intention. They don't enforce rules to Miners. 
Sorry. 
You as a user, running a node or not, vote with your money. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 18:51:07
Validators. Lol. Too much UASF kool aid.
Miners enforce, validate and keep each other honest. If you want to have a say you can stop demanding coins from the dishonest Miners and that is the only reason Miners will ever listen to you and it's how you exercise your vote. 
Or do you think UASF would be anything without hashrate? Or BCC for that matter. 
Like another user said, dictatorship of majority is not what we have here. 
Too much populism leads to this...

I will assume you are not telling me that 1 single voice could overwhelm consensus. So I will skip that extreme argument and ask you, how many voices would be necessary to declare there is no overwhelming majority?
How many Users does Bitcoin actually have? 1 million?
What you propose is either a screaming contest or you attribute more value to some voices than others. But in the end, all Bitcoins are equal.

It should be somewhat priced in. But there are still 15Billion sitting on the sidelines from the previous crash in crypto. Bitcoin is already at 38B Market Cap. It could possibly go to new heights if it gets the corresponding 46.8% of the value waiting to get back in. 
Since some part of the other 53% will probably come in through Bitcoin, I expect a steep rise than a pullback.

It is probably priced in, given the pump Bitcoin has gotten these past days.
It will be consequently priced out as soon as it takes place. People are buying 2 coins atm.

A hard fork doesn't imply that 2 chains survive it. There is a case to be made that Hard Forks actually allow choice, and the money will go to where it is most efficiently employed. Therefore, the resulting chain would probably be more sound than its parent.
No hard fork is an attack on Bitcoin. All hard forks are proposed paths that are either accepted or rejected. Soft Forks actually give you much lesser say as a user when your voting rights are actually associated with where you choose to put your money at.
There is so much disinformation. For a trustless system, I see a lot of trusting souls. 
Furthermore, it is egregious to stand for decentralization and at the same time defend that because 1% seem to have good technical arguments, their vote should be equivalent to the other 99% without actually swaying the vote due to their technical arguments.
You can't have both ways.

The double standards are incredible. Noone actually calls this out?
How is this bypassing consensus? This is the epitome of Consensus. 
You can say and criticize is that it is a stupid Consensus around a stupid and dangerous implementation. That is your prerogative. 
What you cannot say with a straight face is that this is not Consensus and then go around defending other SegWit activations that didn't achieve the necessary threshold. Or worst, activation proposals that game the system in order to achieve 100% fake Consensus by effectively: BYPASSING IT.
I agree with Luke Dashjr there, for better or worse, it will be decided. Or not. Let there be Consensus.
In the end you will probably get SegWit and you don't even need to follow the subsequent HF. Unless you feel Miners are actually important and you need their hashrate.
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:42:14
Please enlighten me how do you accurately and transparently gauge consensus "from the entire community (not just miners)"? 
I would be very curious to understand the brilliance behind this trustless voting mechanism.
Or is the entire community whoever screams loudest on Reddit?

You can have your opinions. But you are not doing anyone any favors by counseling them like this on the value of their coins.

Store of value in something without intrinsic value, i.e. Gold, derives from utility. 
Store of value in Bitcoin derives from its utility as a medium of exchange. How this is so farfetched to some baffles me...
You don't get to choose. You need it to work like Cash, or the store of value is gone.
The main quarrel here is governance and power shift. By limiting on chain capacity you create a new market off chain that doesn't have to compete with on chain. They are basically relieving miners of their "power" which is governed by incentives, and creating a whole new dynamic to Bitcoin. 
LN Hubs will get the power by being normal folks intermediates to operate in the main chain once the fees are high enough.
Limiting on chain capacity virtually guarantees a new market for big players outside mining. This is worth a lot of money. I am betting that someone recognized this because the probability that this idea just so happens to be perfect to guarantee a new market no one envisioned is virtually 0.

I have no idea. Not playing that game. :)
So far my modest predictions came true. Big rise in BTC, big dump in Alts, and 7 Billion FIAT out of the market.
I will just play the other side now. Wait for BCC dump, stock up on those cheap. A big rise in BTC like this can only indicate a massive dump of BCC. I am not sure any shorters will get so lucky. If a dump on BCC is to happen, it there will be a lot of BTC bought.
Don't really know. I am all over the place right now. But this is general lines how I think will come out.

Your code allows for doublespending. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 15:28:06
You don't know. The market cap of each chain will depend on:
1. 2nd Chain Being listed. (someone actually giving it value)
2. Supply and Demand for coins of each chain.
A 50-50 split would probably mean at the exact moment of the big bang, you would have the same value split on 2 chains. 
After that first moment, Market will define everything. Both chains might prosper. Both chains might lose value. One chain might bring all the market with it. Or the market may be split in some different percentage.
A lot of scenarios are possible. You have to make out what probabilities you attribute for each scenario.
My take, which is no investment advice, I think the market will keep dropping as long as there is indecision. This drop will probably accomodate 2 chains if we end up with them or will massively pump the single chain if we manage to activate SegWit before that because everyone that is selling is probably dying to get back in. FIAT is trash as store of value and other Cryptos aren't that stable and actually correlate a lot to Bitcoin, so there aren't real hedging opportunities there.
Since I don't know when that will happen, and I reckon Miners are pretty much playing this drop in price, I am buying as much as I can as soon as possible. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 06:39:54
My 2 cents:
Fundamental value:
- Utility
- Store of Value
What contributes to this value: Real World cost to produce (Energy), and How much and how often people use it (Velocity), the latter is not priced in and that is why we have a scaling debate.
Regarding it's attachment to Energy, it is really in my opinion the key to understanding it's value right now. Miners will only sell for so little because there is an inherent cost of production which could otherwise be redeployed if it were not profitable, rendering Bitcoin useless. The demand for Bitcoin though, comes from its utility and its properties as sound money, which I will not go through and expect you to know already. I will say though, that Sound Money, comprises both CASH utility and Store of Value utility which are not mutually exclusive in the very specific case of Bitcoin. 
As for the moment, we are priced in on store of value because utility has been lacking. With any of the solutions to the scaling debate, this should be priced in soon enough.
However, to increase utility, you need 2 things considering Network capacity will be adequate at all times:
- Adoption by users
- Acceptance by merchants
This is a chicken and egg problem which would be pretty much solved if Bitcoin was less volatile (more used rather than traded). 
But I speculate that for it to be adopted, merchants need to recognize it's properties as a store of value, and actually start to sell goods at a discount rather than conversion prices. Right now there is no incentive to spend Bitcoin when the same amount of USD is available to you. So you would need a discount to do so.
Value is thus, IMO, a complex mixture of all the properties, potential utility, and energy cost.
@_date: 2017-07-15 10:13:58
I partially agree. I would like to add the following:
As long as there is no easier and cleaner way to get BTC, instead of paying premiums everywhere as well as selling fees, Bitcoin will just be too valuable to pay for coffee.
The reason for that is that the Merchant wants to hedge against volatility of BTC vs FIAT, so while he should be offering you a discount for paying in BTC, you are paying a premium everywhere. The Merchant also pays a fee to exchange his BTC which he will charge you.
Meanwhile, every time you spend a Bitcoin today, at no discount, you are losing money tomorrow.
So basically, we need to facilitate exchange for FIAT. Acquiring and Selling BTC has to be less costly. 
Also, merchants who don't understand the value of Bitcoin, should always get paid in FIAT unless hey offer you a discount for paying them with real Money.
Until this date comes, while I support mass adoption, I will never buy any perishable with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-10 15:42:16
I am not sure about that. There is a legitimate possibility that miners could be buying into this drop only to activate SegWit before August 1. Myself, I am not wasting any opportunity. I am buying what my budget permits, every day until August 1.
@_date: 2017-07-24 10:09:26
The way you put it, it sure sounds like a SegWit shortcoming regardless of which fork is implemented. 
Nonetheless, I agree that if it can be solved, it should be solved.
I didn't however hear much outcries when UASF employed a similar strategy, applying pressure by the fact that there was no replay or reorg protection and actually welcoming that fact as an obvious game theoretical pressure point.
Nothing against correcting these issues, ideas should stand alone on their merits. It would do us well though to utilize the same standards for all sides of the coin (pun intended).
@_date: 2017-07-15 05:28:01
I understand it is unpopular. But it is the inevitable conclusion of my rationale. A monopolistic implementation is the perfect pressure point for the dangers I refer to.

Even if that footprint was bigger at he moment, which I doubt, the future will probably arrive faster to a system like Bitcoin than to an age old system reliant on printing presses.

I am waiting for the whole of the Market Cap to come back through Bitcoin. I am banking BTC will rise a while, than pump alts and pullback a little closer to August 1.
I will do it then.
Right now BTC is rising higher than most alts, so if I trade now, I will get less BTC from the same Alts.
Hope it makes sense. It is not investment advice either way. Just how I will play it. And my goal is just more BTC, not USD.
@_date: 2017-07-25 02:59:52
You think the sample in Bitcoin.com is also accurate then? 
@_date: 2017-07-15 08:20:16
I agree completely. 
With only one reference implementation there is just an illusion of choice. This is why I believe one shouldn't rush to shoot down alternative implementations. 
Furthermore, every time a monopolistic implementation chooses a soft fork route, especially one as controversial, it effectively cuts the users from that choice.
And this propaganda about running your own node doesn't help or empower users in any way. Because the truth is, users vote with their money, attributing value to the chain of their choice. For this to happen you need hard Fork, replay and reorg protection and exchange listing.
Until that happens, saying users have a vote is just populist and somewhat irresponsible. 
I don't mind a consensual dictatorship or whatever. I don't care as long as consensus rules are enforced. It is what it is with enough agreement... and you can always Fork it. I have also been saying the result of this experiment will tell us a lot of whether we are really just sheep or not.
What I mind is soft Fork constructions that leave you little choice and little options.

So, better yet than this publicity for the purposes you enumerate, would be for Roger Ver to buy 10.000 BCC for this same price directly on ViaBTC. Showing his support, getting more BCC for this same value the OP proposes that he put on the line, and showing good faith towards ViaBTC. 
However you put it, this offer is still ridiculous. 
The exactly same objectives can be accomplished more efficiently.
Although I am sure the OP will get a standing ovation when he gets to say: "I offered Roger Ver 2000 1:1 and he declined" such is the anxiousness to beat the other party on PRIDE that people decline to use their heads.
You can ping Roger to this idea, I am sure it would bring more publicity than the idiocy proposed by the OP. This is money, not emotion. You want to challenge someone, challenge them for some Ice Bucket Challenge or Eat his own dick on National Televison if BCC crashes or something, that would be a reasonable challenge.
@_date: 2017-07-20 10:43:28
Also correct. If SW represents a 2x increase. I read a lot about 1.7.
However higher fees would also decrease demand, so it's kinda like a chicken egg problem.

@_date: 2017-07-11 15:57:11
Yes. And when push comes to shove...
The bubble in the alt market was eating most of Bitcoin. But my analysis of that is that these were Bitcoin holders who wanted a higher return on investment for a few of their funds. As soon as it crashes, back to Bitcoin it is.
Bitcoin is the end all be all in my view. There is a fight to hold on to the most of 21M coins. If your alt performs better you can then trade it for more Bitcoin.
This Crash makes me believe that even more. And yes, I am a maximalist.

It is a soft fork but the chain will split if this proposal doesn't get outright majority support.
Because it is a soft fork, the other chain will run the risk of reorg if this proposal gets majority hashrate in the meantime.
It is true there will be a split because of the Miners. Only Miners can split the chain. The original chain will split if any Miners back this proposal and not correspond to 100%.
Better get your facts straight and prepare your setup adequately to face a split. 
I am impressed at how uninformed people can be in a system that is built for distrust. Don't take what anyone says for truth. Look for the facts.
@_date: 2017-07-10 03:25:10
Actually, I think their best play would be to raise the difficulty as much as they can prior to August 1. This would make it very difficult for a Minority Split to mine until difficulty adjusts.
If the split is a Majority one, difficulty is irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-07-22 05:34:05
Blockspace does not need to be limited. 
What matters is volume. Miners or anyone else with a business does better to depend on a lot of small customers than a few big ones.
This is why this issue is a fallacy and this problem was used to push off chain solutions.
At best, it is borderline idiotic to depend on high fees... And that is why Lightning Network will do well. Because the business model of High Fees is doomed.
This is a game that Miners have played very badly... and lost.

Why are you rambling about value? Gosh. Read it like this then:
Option 1: I consider something has enough value to be priced on par with Bitcoin at some point in the future. I guess I will just buy it at Bitcoin's price.
Option 2: I consider something has enough value to be priced on par with Bitcoin at some point in the future. I guess I will buy it at today's Market price. 
Now tell me. 
Considering both Options imply that the guys attribute the same Value, and not price, as you claim: Who is the idiot in these options?

Embrace chain splits. Now it might be a corporate one In your view, in the future it might be some rebel in the basement. The power of the people is here. It can only be stopped by preventing all splits and creating enough fear so that noone ever dares to flee the norm.
You are all too worried about Bitcoin's value vs FIAT. Look at the endgame. FIAT is doomed. In a future without FIAT forks are advisable and welcome. Spreading fear on that is not empowering the people in any way.
I am much more worried if Core retains it's monopolistic status.
@_date: 2017-07-08 09:52:35
Is it not more correct to say:
"There's no [PERMANENT] chain split on August 1st unless miners intentionally do it as retaliation.
BIP148 itself does not [PERMANENTLY] split the chain."
If I am not understanding it wrong, this is the correct phrasing of what will happen.
The chain will always split if there is even a single Miner that doesn't support BIP 148 or only a single Miner supports it. 
And in fact, a chain split without replay and reorg protection on the legacy chain, game theory wise, is actually the pressure point of this if BIP 148 doesn't outright get a Majority.
So you could argue that Miners who disagree, have very little choice other than to actually permanently split if faced with a reorg.
Please clarify if I am making some mistake in interpretation or if you are.
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:07:11
In my country Legal Tender means that your official note has to be accepted anywhere to pay for services of registered merchants. 
If I enter a shop and I have money to pay for some item on sale there, they are obligated to accept FIAT. Because it is Legal Tender.
“that the designated money is valid payment for all debts unless there is a specific agreement to the contrary.”
According to wikipedia, Legal Tender means it is valid to extinguish any debt. In some jurisdictions, a merchant may refuse and Legal Tender doesn't apply because there is no prior debt at the act of purchase.
So you are correct. Not in my jurisdiction though. I guess we are both correct.

We are discussing semantics. While all that you say i agree with, you can't seriously argue that an UASF with minority hashing power had a reasonable expectation to not create a chain split. Not only did it expect to, but it had these specific pressure points that made it not really need an agreeing majority.
But this has been discussed to the bone. All there was to say has been said. I am just arguing against double standards here.
I agree always with strong replay and reorg protection. I like free markets without artificial incentives or punishments.

Dear Mam,
You will keep your entire BTC balance.
You will be awarded BCC 1:1. So you will have:
0.532 BTC
0.532 BCC
If you keep them in an exchange like Coinbase, who already publicly stated will not be supporting BCC, it is dubious if you will be awarded those coins as per your right.
If you are sure that they will be worthless, by all means keep them in Coinbase. If you have some doubts, bring them out and decide later what to do with those.
Please ask your son/daughter for help if at some point you decide to interact with your BCC, because you will need different software for each coin which might or might not be complicated if you are not a regular user.
Aside from that, I would just add that by default, it is not a good practice to keep your coins in exchange wallets regardless of any forks.
Best regards,

I am not endorsing Bixin, as I have never used it. But in an ideal world where people actually use Bitcoin this is in line what a responsible service provider should be doing. 
Taking care of the technical shenanigans for their users in difficult times. Service like this prevents a lot of Market madness and helps with stability which is good for new users.

No. I mean 6 B returned to the Crypto market. Still waiting on the other 10 B that left during the crash.
Considering Bitcoin will get its 46% share of this money, I expect to rise a while still. Than it will pull back from people who returned from FIAT into alts through Bitcoin.
This is my expectation.
@_date: 2017-07-18 02:56:58
It will grow as hell because noone will be trading their Bitcoins into a crashing currency.
What might happen, is that you will have to revise how you value Bitcoin. Because it will be pretty worthless to value it VS Dollar.
It will also be very difficult to acquire Bitcoin when noone will want FIAT. 
Miners will start keeping their Bitcoin because there is nothing to sell them against. Electricity Companies will start accepting Bitcoin as payment immediately. Miners will pay workers salary in Bitcoin.
Exchanges will stop accepting FIAT. 
Mining and Exchange employees will then distribute Bitcoin through the Market by using it to pay for goods.
All companies will start receiving payment in Bitcoin and pay their workers in Bitcoin.
The purchasing power of Bitcoin will grow as prices plummet, because everyone wants and needs Bitcoin to conduct trade.
Hello worldwide adoption. 
And this is why Bitcoin cannot be limited to being a settlement layer. Because it will be an answer to nothing.

@_date: 2017-07-20 16:43:25
At the time of the Big Bang, the value of your coins is theoretically split in the percentage of the original hashpower that splits between the 2 chains.
This split is not likely to be perceived in reality, unless both chains split pretty evenly. Even in that case it is doubtful. But theoretically this is what is supposed to happen.
Immediately after the Big Bang, and considering the new chain is also listed on exchanges, users will start attributing it value by buying or selling these coins.
In practical terms, it really depends on the hashrate that splits and if it is a mini minority split you most likely should not even notice a price change on the main chain based on fundamentals.
I suppose it would be something like what I described.
 
Now regarding speculation, it is a monster I dare not predict.

We have different views. While you think altcoins have use, I think hey only have the use that Bitcoin leaves lying about.
I see no use for most altcoins, including Litecoin, when I could have my Bitcoin serving all those purposes. And with utility comes value... you are limiting Bitcoin simply by choice. Not by need.
While you think Bitcoin STILL has 50% MC, I think Bitcoin ONLY has 50% MC because it refuses to fulfill its full potential.
And I am not talking about smart contracts or any other shenanigans. I am talking about being a Monetary System. Because in that sense, Bitcoin is not only the best, but can be all of it.
And we should not lose the first mover advantage we have that granted us the gateway for other currencies to be traded.
This is just my opinion. It is as valuable as my choice is possible to exerciSe. If we have a split where I can economically vote on the path forward, I will be happy. Until then, me and every user are at the mercy of DEVs and Miners while happily clapping for each camp thinking we have a say in this.
And at last, we might come to see that hardforks are just like biting your tongue. We will be attacked many times, the only way anyone will stop us is by fearmongering hard forks and make us follow some status quo out of fear.

If you give Bitcoin all the shortcomings of Gold, than I'd rather hold Gold.
Bitcoin is already better than Gold in every monetary aspect. Given sufficient adoption it might even release Gold from its monetary attributions to its other relevant uses.

I don't know if SegWit is to blame. I am not technically versed on that. Sounded like it from OPs post. Because it doesn't seem from his explanation that something malicious was introduced to fuck with SegWit but rather, steps weren't taken specifically to protect it. So it seems this problem is brought up by a SegWit characteristic rather than an ABC spec.

I think BTC has a major failure point. As soon as it gets widely adopted by people who have to defer to trust to use it, it is easily controllable through propaganda as the remaining of our systems. 
This is why the establishment has no worries. For Bitcoin to be a threat, their users and ecosystem players have to become literate in a lot of topics in order to not be influenced by a few shot calling gurus.

How do you fork off something that doesn't even exist yet? 
That is like saying the new tree branch is now the trunk. Good luck with that.
It's a nice construction to be able to claim the "Real Bitcoin" status, but that will only happen if Miners hardfork or just follow UASF. 
Otherwise, Legacy Chain continues as always and UASF forks itself into an altcoin.

That's the thing about startups. It's a make or break business. 
I always attribute a probability to those returns and then calculate expected value. 
The crypto market is highly volatile but has given consistent returns way above that. It is also not a
Make or break business. And with that capital you play a bigger role than you would in VC Market.
You can also calculate your expected value base on the probability you attribute that Bitcoin will be worth approx 15k in 2 years.
I wouldn't invest entirely on your either/or proposition though. 
This is my opinion, not investment advice.

Bitcoin will be what the economic majority decides it will be. These being exchanges for all intents and purposes. Users vote with their money through those.
The bonus of a softfork is that if you achieve Majority, you are Bitcoin. If you are Minority, you don't run the risk of altcoining yourself.
This was the design for this proposal. It will be a game of chicken for the name of Bitcoin. Miners have little chance but to play along or to hard fork unless they are 90% certain that no Miners will mine on this proposal's chain.
In fact, I imagine if it weren't for the Bitcoin brand, both sides would have hardforked long ago.
One thing I know it isn't. Consensus. 
I will not judge the merits of the proposal. I will however judge the way in which it is being pushed forth.

@_date: 2017-07-15 07:58:10
It is forceful because it doesn't even require he majority of Miners.
For the incentive to move or the punishment of not moving to UASF chain, you just need 51% minus X, where X is the mining share of the biggest pool.
If you get to that point, little choice remains for the miners other than moving to UASF or Hardfork and altcoin themselves.
Meaning there is incentive to move to UASF chain unless your are sure other miners do not move. 51% + biggest miner share sure.
I have said many times it is a brilliant construction from a strategy point of view. It is not consensus though.
If the idea was to put a choice up for consensus, than a hardfork up front would do it more transparently and accurately identify what the economic majority actually stands for. All this circle jerk in my opinion has to do with Bitcoin naming. Everyone is avoiding the last move, because last move loses. As long as this continues we will be in a stalemate.

We do not follow Roger Ver. It just so happens that he agrees with us on how to scale Bitcoin. 
If he were to make his own coin, very few would follow him out of some misguided loyalty.
I would like to believe that the same happens to the people who have different scaling visions, that they happen to align with Core's vision and not be guided by it.
So we could stop with this Roger Ver nonsense or CSW nonsense or Core nonsense, because no one should be following people, but ideas.
Everyone of those will have their own interests at heart, if they happen to align with others, so be it, but do not mistake a common interest for blinded loyalty.

People are pricing the 2 coins together at this moment though. So 52% is the market cap for 2 coins that already exist in people's minds.
I am sure that's what the buy pressure is about.
And for anyone interested in dumping BCC, stocking up on BTC to get as many BCC to dump is the way to go.
This is the final preparation for August 1.
I expect it to correct as soon as the fork becomes clear.

I don't care either. But the fact of the matter is whoever gains this right also gains a lot of visibility from new users. It enormously reduces any acquisition cost to your camp. 
Furthermore, this has turn into a shark tank where one side's capitulation is required for the other side's satisfaction. And the sure proof way is to be able to claim "I am Bitcoin".

But you would certainly learn not to have your family savings in Crypto. It's irresponsible to keep your family's future tied with this volatility. Where I stand it's called gambling.
Just as if you kept all your money in FIAT and the USD tanks, it is not fair, but it's life.
Also, scams are crimes, Crypto or not Crypto. These are already protected by law. 
What we should have is a responsible community that instead of trying to be early investors in every ponzu schemes would denounce them. What we should have is better quality assurance ICOs, not because of law, but because of responsibility.
What we should have is hold ourselves to higher standards. When you have regulation, you have what are called minimum standards... this is always worst than high standards to which a community lives up to. And legitimizes Holding to the lowest possible standard... 
Also, regulation often comes under the guise of protecting the vulnerable but serves little purpose other than barring access.

Allow me to correct your following statement:
"the currency currency of any country is based on what people think it is worth and is actually just one big game of 'I think its worth something so ill use it"
The currency of any country is based on LEGAL TENDER, which mandates that merchants cannot reject it as a form of payment and thus its value is big banged into existence.
People do not attribute any value to FIAT and if someone is hoarding FIAT I will definitely question their intelligence. 
People use it though, because it is the worthless shit you can give someone in order to actually get something of value.
If merchants could reject FIAT I bet they would prefer to get your mortgage, or a bar of gold. 
This is why I think for Bitcoin to actually have utility value, Merchants have to incentivize holders to spend Bitcoin, because no one will spend Bitcoin when they can just get the same for useless FIAT.
To incentivize spending Merchants have to recognize Bitcoin is a better store of value and thus, sell goods at a discounted price in exchange for Bitcoin.
This will only happen when volatility decreases though.
But as far as virtual value goes, Bitcoin is much more REAL than FIAT.

For the record, I am not a Barrycoiner. I am a Big blocker for sure. 
I do not claim my big block coins will be better or worse economically. That is for users to decide with their money. 
What I don't like is soft forks like the UASF which can at best be described as blackmail. Utilizing subtle game theoretical incentives, punishments and risks to force a choice rather than present a choice.
I would be perfectly okay with this through a Hard Fork. And I still think the only reason for trying so hard to accomplish SegWit activation through a soft fork has a lot to do with the lack of consensus and the risk of forking themselves into an alt coin.
This to me says a lot about how little the consensus is around SegWit. If it was overwhelming, you could Hard Fork it anytime without much peril.

I made no effort to hide my technical illiteracy. 
But 99% of the experts? Who decides who is an expert? Is there a central authority? Furthermore, who decides that the consensus that matters is that of the experts?
I make no irrational demands. I have even said that if there was consensus for a dictatorship in Bitcoin, by choice, I would not oppose, I would simply defect.
My sole demand is that this be done through a hard Fork so I, along with all other users, could vote with our money.
The so called financial experts also fed us out beloved FIAT system. I don't trust experts to decide for me and I am glad Bitcoin allows me hat choice. Until some brilliant expert decides it doesn't. Or that I shouldn't be given a choice because I am too illiterate.
I am baffled at those arguments of technical or race superiority when all I request is a choice. And let the market decide.
@_date: 2017-07-18 02:08:39
In my opinion there are 2 main reasons for this:
1. Transaction Fees (which we are trying to solve through several solutions).
2. Incentive to spend Bitcoin (which only the Merchants can solve at current state)
Right now we have to understand that for most of us, the goal is to hold more Bitcoin. Bitcoin has proven itself not only as a Store of Value, but also an Increase of Value (a good investment).
The problem is most merchants cannot risk the volatility, which basically means they trade Bitcoin for FIAT as soon as possible.
Trading Bitcoin for FIAT does not come free also. So there is a cost to that.
So basically, when you want to pay for stuff, you are paying a premium one way or another for using Bitcoin. Even if the Merchant doesn't pass their costs to you.
There is not enough incentive to spend. In FIAT, artificial inflation actually does this job very well. It encourages spending. Getting immediate value out of your Currency.
What should be happening, is that because it is much sounder money, you should be getting a discount everytime you pay in Bitcoin. But until volatility decreases and the sell/buy spread narrows, I don't suppose Merchants will be able to take this risk. 
The simplest step would be to reduce fees to a minimum.

That should be somewhat easy to assess.
If they are serious in protecting the main chain, the same strategy applies as to the UASF:
They should push difficult as much as possible (no miners idle).
If they are preparing to mine UAHF:
They should try and keep difficulty to a minimum, and have miners idle and ready.
I have seen Hashrate upwards of 7.5 ^8 GH/S. Right now it is at 6.6.
I suspect the ongoing hashrate should tell us alot about the strategy of each player.
