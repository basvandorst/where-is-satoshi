What makes bitcoin safety critical when it's using an outdated SHA hash compared to KECCAK256?
Bitcoin is becoming less safe by the day currently, it's only a matter of time.

The miners.  If a user with old software determines a block and new chain is invalid, that user just no longer gets to participate in the network.  I thought this should be common sense.  Users are not producing blocks, miners are.  Miners could all switch overnight, and if you protested by not upgrading your software, you are shit out of luck and the world will continue on with you (the miners and other users.)

There are a dozen different bitcoin versions, but only one is allowed to be discussed strangely.   They all share the origin code and genesis block but this sub doesn't seem to care much about all bitcoins.

That's how bitcoin has always worked.  Miners run the coin, users use the resulting coins.

As someone in blockchain development, none of what you said makes sense to me.  If all bitcoin miners change their consensus, all users will have to upgrade if they want to participate in the network.  Miners control this.  Fully validating nodes do not run the coin, they merely want to stay compatible with the longest chain with the most hashrate (because without it, the current bitcoin code is insanely slow to adjust difficulty and blocks would barely be coming out.)

Don't you think this is a double standard, you're not "supposed to discuss altcoins" unless it's shitting on bitcoin cash.  Why?

I'm not sure why you would ask a question that's easily google-able within seconds?  Have you looked it up yourself yet?

They are all variations of the same code and chain, technically they are variants of bitcoin and even bitcoin itself has diverged from its original form.

Have you ever heard of the Nakamoto Consensus?  It's the foundation of bitcoin and goes over this concept.

I just want to know, the person trying to call me out, if they would even understand my proof of anything -- and it is very clear you wouldn't be able to verify correctness to begin with so this is entirely pointless.  Enjoy your week, I've got you tagged and know to avoid you as a waste of keystrokes so cheers.  You really should research bitcoin tech someday though.

I'm not trying to defraud anybody, I'm mainly an ethereum smart contract developer and have enjoyed the engineering aspect of blockchain for somewhere like eight years now -- so I'm speaking from an engineering perspective that they are bitcoin variants, not their hashrate/pricing.  I used to mine BTC back when CPUs/GPUs were still capable.

Discussing past experiences that I miss is now appeal to authority and not nostalgia of the pre-ASIC era, I see your logic now.  How about you challenge me to any smart contract with any logic you want?  You could even verify the results online in remix.  Deal?  Are you even capable of running remix to test contracts and gas usage?  Would you like to learn anything or are you here to shitpost, ad hominem, and consume memes?  If it's the last three there's no point in us exploring actual blockchains and the scripts within them (of which, bitcoin has them too, would you like to discuss those as well?)  Do you know anything about them at all? Do you know the developer who introduced the opcodes into bitcoin to begin with all those years ago?  Have you read the BIP about it?
I really do wonder who people like you are sometimes.

As you disregarded all of my previous questions, here's a simple one for you: what are the implications of using bytes32 in ethereum contracts compared to other data types?  Since you've got some contracts live and deployed this should be an easy one for you.

Discussing blockchain development is an appeal to authority?  Good god this community has gone to complete shit.  I miss 2013 bitcoin days, these new bro-investors have ruined the space and missed the entire point of the tech.  I guess I'll stay on the dev gitters where real people discuss the real challenges we face, not shitpost price memes all day.
