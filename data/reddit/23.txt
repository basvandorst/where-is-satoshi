[Transaction fees](
*It is envisioned that over time the cumulative effect of collecting transaction fees will allow somebody creating new blocks to "earn" more bitcoins than will be mined from new bitcoins created by the new block itself. This is also an incentive to keep trying to create new blocks even if the value of the newly created block from the mining activity is zero in the far future.*

Buy it when it's recovered at least $100.

Rain man
@_date: 2014-09-30 05:46:34
No. Never.
@_date: 2014-09-30 05:27:30
Because their entire allowance is riding in it. 
@_date: 2014-09-28 17:25:05
$389 today. Cheaper than when you originally posted 4 days ago. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 02:27:53
I hope you're joking. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 00:13:52
It's worth whatever someone's willing to pay for it. 
@_date: 2014-09-22 19:07:43
But then it will go to the moon, right?
@_date: 2014-09-22 15:36:01
It's currently crashing but will go to the moon in just a few weeks.
@_date: 2014-10-31 05:56:56
Good luck with that.
@_date: 2014-09-23 22:45:39
Give it a few days and you'll be able to buy that cheap again.

still waiting
@_date: 2014-10-09 19:42:24
I've been waiting almost 3 hours now as well.

Ahh ok. I actually didn't zoom in to read the words, which have indeed been updated for Bitcoin. I first saw this same chart a few years ago during Silver's rally to $50.
So no judgement on the OC value of this updated pic. 
@_date: 2014-10-10 05:28:53
Well, the original creator is.  This is not OC. 
@_date: 2014-10-07 02:29:49
Are you a wizard?
@_date: 2014-09-25 20:28:04
The kid's probably already hacked.

[Falling Knife](
@_date: 2014-10-05 15:29:39
Still looks REALLY expensive to me. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 02:01:37
You don't lose money until you sell. Hodl and it will go to the moon.
j/k you're fuct.
@_date: 2014-10-08 23:50:20
Well that settles that. 
@_date: 2014-10-19 16:14:54
Kibbles n bits?
@_date: 2014-10-06 20:43:28
Settle down everybody. Known troll.
@_date: 2015-04-28 06:45:09
The Limbo?
@_date: 2015-02-07 15:17:23
None. The lightbulbs keep getting stolen.
