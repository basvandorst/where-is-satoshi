1) Ability for more people to *use* bitcoin, making it more attractive to the regular consumer. 
2) Shows everyone who lives outside our crypto bubble that crypto is legitimate. Partnering with Visa for this is a means to an end. 
Two great examples of how it’s helping bitcoin. I dare you to go create a payment processor. It’s not as simple as you’d think, otherwise everyone would be doing it. 
The only legitimate criticism is that most people won’t want to *spend* their crypto (myself included). The best argument I’ve heard on the topic is that until the markets stabilize and demand for speculation subsides, this will remain true.

Have fun in your little maximalist bubble. Since when did Bitcoin go from a free flow of ideas to “everything has to be exactly as I imagine it to be.”
We can’t just go from the world as it is to the decentralized world we’re all working toward. There are steps in the middle to get us to that place. This isn’t a 0-to-100 situation. 
In the end, the success or failure of this technology will rely on the products/services/models that the majority of consumers adopt. You can disagree with the way this tech works but it isn’t going to be the thing that kills Bitcoin.

I think the tweet says "starting at 4.5% interest" and "up to 50% LTV"?

I don't think it does anything to your credit. Found this on the site:
