Coinbase has an option to set up a bank account or paypal as a means to sell and transfer your funds out. You could also sell to a person who wishes to buy the bitcoin.

He wants cash. Those are usd capable exchanges. I never said there weren’t more. I started with the ones I’ve personally used/trust. Binance has an option, but its not available in all states. I didn’t miss any point. He wants cash, I gave him an option. You don’t have to like said option, but I wasn’t wrong in my suggestion. I’ve been trading for several years now so I’m not new to any of this. Make a suggestion to the OP if you don’t like mine.

They are what they are, but there are very few ways to go from fiat to btc and back to fiat again. Kraken, gemini, and coinbase can that I am aware of for United States folks. Beyond that peer to peer works just as well.

That will depend on where you live as quite a few exchanges do not allow US customers for instance. Coinbase while US friendly, does not allow purchases with credit cards any longer unless the card was already saved before their decision to remove support for that purchase type.

I agree. If its too much trouble to validate your claims then you are probably full of crap.

Well there are quite a number of reasons why, but I love your fundamental approach! Its always good to view and understand all the pieces to the puzzle.
