Thanks for the answers! You immediately assume a lot of things ;) I was just asking because I have a business idea that I will present to a jury. It will be essential to transfer small amounts of money around the world, so I just needed a rough estimate of what it costs. And yes to make it work I certainly will need someone who is an absolut expert in the field...

@_date: 2016-04-11 17:54:53
haha you got me, sorry
@_date: 2016-04-07 13:36:17
Still thanks for the hint!!
@_date: 2016-04-11 19:46:44
Well the usability still sucks from the perspective of a non technical vendor. However I have some ideas what I could start selling and I'm excited that OB is finally out!
@_date: 2016-04-07 13:32:43
Oh ok, still I'm interested in the topic, do you understand how the weights are calculated? is it just a decreasing linear ofunction of time or what?
@_date: 2016-04-03 17:15:18
Hahah nice!!
I think I can try that, unfortunately I don't know the jury members yet but I could write into the description of the idea that I have to hand in tomorrow that they shoukd install a wallet. If they don't do it, which wallet (or maybe changetip?) is the easiest to just receive some coins? Where you don't need to fill in all sort of crap?
@_date: 2016-04-07 21:44:51
lets say I should not need to. When I'm using ebay I don't have to do shit.
Anyway I'm totally ready to spend hours trying to figure it out ;)
I followed this quide: 
Up to point 5 where I'm stuck since I cannot download the rootCA.crt. The quide given at step 5 is much less precise in what their doing for someone who barely used the terminal in his life.
(I did an introduction course to java where we used it a little. I'm not that un technical either...)
@_date: 2016-04-11 17:54:40

Thanks I hoped someone would link a site like since since I couldn't remember the name
@_date: 2016-04-07 13:38:04
hahah ok I won't send anything but I hope they'll get their shit together at some point. 
But can still someone explain this to me
And whats the price to buy the site ? ;)
@_date: 2016-04-07 19:25:24
@_date: 2016-04-16 12:47:43
Cool, yeah please do this! I think it looks like an awesome service. It will certainly have some difficulties getting some traction. They will have to find a way to not having people to buy bitcoin before they can use the service. But maybe just hand out some fractions of a cent to people so they can try it. 
@_date: 2016-04-08 00:23:14
fucking stupid this what you're saying doesn't have anything to do with "priced in" which is basic market efficiency hypothisis.
The point is that everyone knows that the supply will drop, thats why we are already buying. or we already bought! When I bought my first coins it was certainly imoortant to knwo how the supply will look so it's in that sense already priced in. 
Think: when everyone knows prices will go  up tomorrow, they wil buy today, thats why prices will go up today.
@_date: 2016-04-07 19:23:50
@_date: 2016-04-08 00:27:47
Do i understand it correctly that when I'm writing this scp [username] address of server]:[file path to rootCA.crt] [destination folder] into the terminal I need to be in the destination folder? When i do this it ask me my password.This should be the password of the server itself and not open bazaar right? it denies permission. Do you have an idea why? In the process I needed to create 3 different password, I tested them all of course so I really don't know how I cannot have the right password.
@_date: 2016-04-11 14:41:36
Well I followed the quide up to point 5 where I tried to set up SSL (I have no idea what that is) with the help of the second quide. There at Step 2: "Install the Certificate for the Client it" I tried to type in this (with my data of course):
 scp [username] address of server]:[file path to rootCA.crt] [destination folder] and it asks me a password. However even thought I tried all passwords I needed so far it always denies them. So I'm lost there. i have no idea whether I did somewhere a mistake or not.
Any ideas?
I'm not really technical so please explain it simple.
And I'm currently not at home so I don't have the password with me. You can pm me if you think you know where the problem lies so we can write when I'm back at home
@_date: 2016-04-11 19:47:37

yeah I know of course but it's money that I worked for and invested wisely why the fuck can't I be my bank and spend whatever the fuck I want for free. That's what I'm saying, I do understand their intentions
@_date: 2016-04-12 00:05:42
small qunatities (small amounts of money) and digital. Just wait the open source nature of this will be the source of a lot of innovation. Just first of all think about awesome search engines, that automatically can compare prices due to a decentralised network of people who decide (besides an algortihm) which goods are comparable and which aren't. They would live in india and get paid very small amounts of Bitcoin. 
Think about all the digital goods that will be sold here. 
Think about the moderators who could function as much more than what they currently do but act as sort of third parties to decide which human is right about something.
Think maybe about machines who might be able to automatically transact with each other through this platform. 
I know it's not easy to come up with ideas about this but just think about when you heard of bitcoin the first time. I just thought it's some strange payment ponzi scheme. Turns out that transactions are very efficient (like with OB) and that transactions are programmable. These simple facts make it pretty great. 
Just try to come up with one use case yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:06:28

@_date: 2017-12-03 18:18:34
This is precisely what I find so stupid, are you trolling. They were of course, a bubble just doesn't imply that the underlying thing is worth 0. george soros argues that there is a given trend and that the market starts to invest in that. this further accelerates the trend which causes more investment. this goes on for a while until the share of price increase is decoupled from the trend. at some point it goes into the other direction. 
doesn't mean the trend is not strong enough to create the next bubble. But this one is about to go down
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:34:31

My current thesis is that the longer it doesn't go up the more will the excitement fade. A crash is extremely likely anyway. the question ist just from here to 8k or from 40k to 20k

I study economics, I get that with the unit of account, of course it doesn't matter uf it's usd or PI or whatever, but the central banks arround the world are exactly trying to preserve that value in a more or less predictable band, so adjusting the supply to fluctuations in demand.
(ok in reality we've had different kinds of system during history and today most of the money/credit is created by banks).
Partly since I'm a huge nerd was just technically. Can we use the exchange rate of a trustless exchange between two currencies (that don't have a middleman) as an input for the protocol of a new one (respectively for one of them)?
Just as a thought experiment, I think it will most certainly be Bitcoin that will win in a huge way. 
(I'm actually going to put kind of a lot of money into it at the end of the year)
@_date: 2015-12-30 18:13:28
ahh nice that makes sense

I'd just like to give some bears space to give their opinion. Btc had 5 bubbles that crashed for some month. Who ever says this is cannot happen at all is clearly a moron.
I'm not saying it happens now and I'm highly optimistic long term (1 m per coin) but it's a mania right now obviously.

@_date: 2017-02-25 02:04:39
don't think it's true, mining blocks is a market. opposite to the fix amount of coins miners get for finding a block, the transaction fees are market base (as far as I understand). That means if making a tramsaction on the network becomes more diserable (adoption) and blocksizes stay the same, then yes the fees probably will go up. But the fees won't just rise because the price rises because miner don't get a fixed btc amount, they get a variable dollar amount in bitcoin.
but basically yes we need scalling solutions, otherwise fees will rise a lot 
@_date: 2016-01-03 11:04:24
Hahahah „wealth building company“

Wow that means some economist could sit together and create their own value token and control the supply of it, nice!
@_date: 2017-03-20 10:12:19
Ok thank you. So since I don't really use Bitcoin day to day I could simply withdraw everything to the hardware wallet and be safe, right?
@_date: 2016-03-01 16:35:12
Thanks for the answer.
Is a nano ledger as safe as a trezor, do you know how it works more or less?
I guess you connect it to a device to see the balance etc and to do a transaction it just signes the message offline instead of on the device directly, is that right?
@_date: 2017-02-22 13:41:15
Well nothing is happening is not true at all. People here are always ... when more people will use it...
But it's clearly growing exponentially. In the last 3 year the user base probably exploded by factor 8 or something like that. When you look at coinbases user or blockchain.info number of wallets it's pretty obvious
@_date: 2017-02-08 12:03:56
hahahah I had to google what that means
@_date: 2016-01-23 03:04:19


ok thanks, yes visa. I'll ask my friend what he has...
@_date: 2017-03-30 22:23:25
well if they'd have all their mining equipment in 1 area in china. why not blowing that up causing the BU hashrate to drop.
A strategically placed bomb has always solved the big problems
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:19:24
thanks a lot for the fats answer.
This thread just got me interested in the storage of messages in the blockchain:
Do you think the blockchain will help bypassing restrictions of governments?
@_date: 2016-03-22 23:34:00
of course I'm not trying to do this all. My business idea is very specific, but it's based on the assumption that bitcoin will succeed and will change the world. So that someone gives me money I have to convince that person that this will indeed be the case.
@_date: 2017-03-22 12:29:17
yes I know thanks. I hate it to store the money of my friends.
Which wallets are safe to use? where do you have your money?
@_date: 2017-03-30 22:21:18
yes I absolutely know. But if you hurt the hashrate of BU miners enough, the value of the chain could collapse, causing people to stay with the original chain.
@_date: 2016-01-23 16:50:39
So actually no eonomist can criticize the fixed supply of Bitcoin, so we can win any argument against every economist ;)
@_date: 2017-03-03 13:06:49

They beautifully build their network. 
@_date: 2017-01-16 23:49:47
I already gave him that, thank you. What else could you recommend?
He's a bit of a nerd and I think more interested in how trust algorithms work instead of real world applications. 
@_date: 2018-10-09 14:11:25
That's true. However, I think there are many people believing very strongly in the support line at 5900-6000. And on the upside it's more random. So for a whale to trigger the market to go in one direction it would be easier on the downside. Much easier probably.
On the assumption that he manages to break the line of course. But I could imagine that in low volume markets it's a cheaper calculated risk that whales could strategically take.
I'm scared
@_date: 2017-01-16 23:50:20

@_date: 2017-01-04 21:55:24
hahaha epic. I live in switzerland I hope the cliche is right, we'll see when BTC = 7'000-10'000 USD
@_date: 2017-01-22 21:10:12
Sorry but i don't think many people have 500 Bitcoin around so this doesn't make much sense. Bet him for 1 Btc
@_date: 2017-01-22 13:31:34
That's one reason why it's such a good investment. When the internet got adopted you might could have invested in some specific companies, or buy domain names but it was never possible to bet directly on the value of the protocol. With Bitcoin this is exactly possible and because of that you have a nice little diversification.
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:40:11

@_date: 2016-11-11 13:02:26
I don't think that's soooo much. My guess is that we have over 10mio Bitcoin users at this point (based on numbers that the big exchanges publish from time to time). Over a year this would be 300'000 new user, or just an increase of 3%. So meh...

Thanks for answering!
I already startet coding and I'm getting better at it. But I find it hard to really dig into something when I don't have any deadline for it. I'm one of these guys who is lazy but can work his ass of if he has to.
How important do you think is coding if I don't want to end up as a programmer but rather would like to build entire products/companies in the long run. I'm learning it because I thought I need some knowledge about it anyway (and because deep down I'm a nerd).
Do you agree on that?
@_date: 2016-11-26 22:14:55
you're right but on the other side we will see much of that open source...
@_date: 2017-01-24 18:50:26

You're cool! I have a big psychological hurdle when I feel I'm studying or working on something that doesn't interests me. That's why I think I will definitely not be able to work in a very big organization. I want to build my own ideas. But I still have a certain lack of leadership experience to really motivate other people to work with me. But I try to develop that. I'm looking for a master program where I need to work on projects (less academic more project oriented). I think with your attitude you'll get very successfull

mmh ok thank you very much. Coinbase doesn't let me withdraw fiat? that sucks, what about gemini? But I still had some problem if the exchange I'm registered at is getting hacked. That's what I fear. 
What about Kraken and Bitfinex can't I withdraw fiat there? I'm willing to send  ID and everything.
@_date: 2016-11-12 01:15:52
We have whatever 21.inc is building and stated it will be a first real use case and megaupload coming very very soon! I think you're very right. Bitcoin is now just slightly above the prices from when mt. Gox collapsed when I got into Bitcoin. During this time we had one major fucking exchange and tons of newspaper writing about the Bitcoin ponzi sceem. Now we have government who want to use similar tech and rooms full of guys in suits listening to someone talking about the blockchain. For me the progress Bitcoin made during the last 3 years is simply incredible. The number of Bitcoin user is hard to guess but of the numbers the big exchanges provide from time to time it is in my opinion very likely that we now have over 10 million users and that the system is clearly growing exponentially. 
In my view we will see prices slowly trending up during the beginning of 2017 and then explode into a next big bubble where we will have prices above 5'000 per coin.
(but maybe just for a short period of time)

Would be awesome!
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:00:13
no there is a log that the trezor does automatically. When you logged in etc etc.

@_date: 2017-11-29 20:11:07
hahahah same here. it's not easy I have enough money that I'd be ready to pay for a reliable service but there are only these shit exchanges and OTC stuff that requires huge trade sizes
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:22:40
this is so ridiculous

Such a bullshit

Now it went through but I'm not sure yet if twice. Such crap I'm getting very scared to have my money there

From any block? could you explain a bit what he is doing? My transaction was on the 2nd of september
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:23:39


ahhh awesome thanks! What do you think about privacy? this service would know quite a lot about you then right?
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:45:23
Of course it existed. it forked on 1 of august
Maybe you're thinking of btc gold.
It gets confusing after all these forks ;)
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:43:10
Why the fuck am I downvoted I lost a lot of money. this sub should be here for such cases

@_date: 2017-04-07 05:26:05
hahahahah he actually said that, wtf?!
@_date: 2019-04-04 09:38:38
Yeah but I would not see a reason by people keep on opening them up in a significant way over time. so the exponential component of the trend comes most likely from user growth. 
There probably have also been people using the internet daily in the early days and others who had something installed and never used it. I don't find that a really good argument when thinking about adoption. For me the number of people having a wallet just gives the potential for someone who creates a new service that only works with bitcoin payments to make money. For example if Twitter would start using bitcoin payments as incentive or tips mechanism I'm sure many some people who don't trade it regularly but have a wallet might start using it. 
@_date: 2017-04-17 20:59:35
mmh bö this is a way more general question, why Bitcoin attracts user. I want to assume that this is the case because it's a fact that that happened over the last 8 years. I'm interested in how this could change the scaling debate.
Will it become more or less likely that we can achieve a consensus
@_date: 2016-02-29 23:20:42
well I have a bitstamp account but with my phone the two factor auth doesn't seem to work (just contacted the support team). Well I could transfer it to a coinsbase or circle wallet where I can do the two factor with my phone.
Best idea is probably to buy a tresor....
@_date: 2016-09-05 22:11:22
I know. But I want to reach people in poor countries cheaply, what's the problem?
@_date: 2016-09-28 20:26:54
Wait until your smartphone pays someone to give you internet access. You will use it!
@_date: 2016-09-28 22:22:54
he meant the second one, but what do I know. And I guess projects take always longer than expected. But anyways when you think that some banks say they will have their own blockchain in 2020. In 2017 the world might have a new payment system that is hugely efficient and can scale to levels visa can dream of. 
Bitcoin is clearly growing exponentially, I couldn't be more excited!!
@_date: 2017-09-14 08:51:13
No no business based. We need to analyze the business itself and ask him/her questions about it
Do you know someone?

Thank you!
@_date: 2017-09-10 16:29:06
I think this is rather problematic. If everyone freaks out you're smart buying into it. If no one does it means the top would be near (not necessarily what I think currently though)
@_date: 2017-10-17 13:05:39
This is actually  sign that the top might be near, what do you think? I talk about a short term top not the 1M per coin long-term goal
@_date: 2017-10-18 10:05:07
thanks for that reply. It's surprising though since I guess he has some bitcoins and probably is wealthy enough to not give a shit about a paycheck. 
@_date: 2016-09-29 08:56:20
most employees don't follow it?! Please correct me but aren't they pretty much all developers who probably are hugely interested in the development of lightning?
Anyway he was a Ph.D in computer science. I don't know exactly on what he's working on but I'm sure he's following it closely
@_date: 2017-10-30 20:34:58
thanks! just as many statistics as possible about the how many people were using btc. even just guesses from back then or how many people were in this subreddit (I could do some % calculations)
@_date: 2016-10-21 19:02:36
I give that e certain probability aswell. I think because of 21.co, Megaupload, several unexpected developments and general growth of adoption in the wordl we will see another bubble that pushes prices between 5000-10'000. Thhis would bring the market cap to above 100 billion. Then we will have stagnation for 3 years probably again during which a broad worldwide infrastructure will emerge. This infrastructure (think 21.co chips in million of devices or private blockchains that make the process of buying btc much faster and cost efficient) will set the ground for huge networks to be built. a global meshnetwork, zero remittance transfers cost, truly global freelance platforms, distributed file sharing incentivized by micropayments, your car paying the tollgate, and much much cooler stuff that I can't think of.
But maybe we have to wait a little linger for that, we'll see. But I mean where was the internet in 1995?

Are you guys kidding me?! I got excited and it's just a fucking ponzi sceme. Fucking bastards these scamers...
@_date: 2015-11-11 22:53:50
ok yeah that's right, i just meant that this doesn't really lead to something. I don't think that many people will become Bitcoin user because they understand that it could be huge in 5-10 years, only if you are really addicted you're trying to pay your bills with bitcoin etc.
of course infomration is important, but there still needs to be a killer app (or lots of different use cases)
@_date: 2015-11-11 21:16:01
They don't really give a shit, one friend bought at 450 and it went straight down to 170. I told him just to fucking wait and tried to point out again some aspects of the tech again
@_date: 2015-11-11 21:22:48
I also tell them about the risks involved. And it's not really a lot of money they invested either
@_date: 2015-11-27 14:39:52
Wow thanks guys, could get interesting next year in this industry. 
@_date: 2016-10-01 12:38:23
the number of transactions is doubling every year, I don't get how you can say there is no such growth?
Stuff like indian adoption is the reason for this. I mean wtf is the problem, exponential growth means a truck of lambos, just wait a bit
@_date: 2016-10-25 11:16:35
Sorry but I strongly disagree with you. Why do you want to pay your rent with bitcoin? to save 2 bucks in fees?
We can built global meshnetworks, make file sharing a real business (megaupload), save hundreds of billions in remittance fee (the infrastructure is being built), have a commercial free internet, include very poor people into the global economy, have absolute free trade, buy drugs online (if you're into that), machines directly pay each other. And much much more. I think that you will be able to pay for a coffee or your rent will be the last thing bitcoin will be used for. 
These are the things that will make bitcoin a global payment system. I got into it 2.5 years ago. You just need to agree that the number of people who got into this since then is remarkable.
This is the reason why ultimately the price will be much much higher of this asset, and why I invested way way to much money into it
@_date: 2015-11-11 21:21:56
yeah but no one really cares, it's just not in their interest, not a lot of people will really talk about it with you. It's like when you say something like it's very likely that there will be a big war in (somewhere not near you). it will affect many people, but just no one gives a shit.
so at least my friends should get rhich so i will not have to pay for everey shit when Bitcoin adopts
@_date: 2015-11-03 10:52:54
Who else fucking hates this? I wanted to work during my semester break and put everything into Bitcoin, now I'm fucked, got so few of them!!
@_date: 2015-11-11 21:23:59

@_date: 2017-05-31 23:59:53
thanks it's very intresting
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:00:08
otherwise I'll call the Btc CEO, I'd be really pissed
@_date: 2015-11-14 01:17:23
holy shit THANKS man!!! the first tip I've ever received!!!
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:22:50
ok thanks. people always say this makes the UASF more liekly but isn't this exactly why no one would switch to that chain? Why would I switch to the chain that is not really supported by significant mining power? I mean of course if every exchange would switch sure, but does it look that way? coinbase/Kraken/gemini/bitstamp etc have they stated anything like that?
@_date: 2017-05-23 09:59:32
Bitcoin has a self driving component build in price wise. because the probability of adoption depends on the opinion about it from the market participants. if prices rise it's like a consensus shift of investors. so a rising price causes more investement to flow into it (startups etc), because it's like a signal that everyone agrees to invest in this. Therefore a rising price makes it more valuable. combined with the huge media attention setting it causes a self reinforcing cycle. I assume we're at the beginning since otherwise it would be by far the smallest bubble. but also, and that's essential, we had FUCKING expoinential user growth now for 3 years after the last bubble. People sometimes don't even realize how fast btc is growing.
@_date: 2017-05-03 21:54:19
brought my parents and my brother to each buy one at exactly that price
@_date: 2016-05-13 15:55:27
Thanks but it's not really that. Think of a freelancer website where all transactions are in Bitcoin. It's not exactly that but it comes close.
@_date: 2015-11-11 21:18:58
Well my brothers ALWAYS said yeah yeah I'll once buy one, so I increased my rate of convincing ;)

why? doesn't segwit kill asicboost anyway? 
So if and only if 80% is met, segwit and block size increase will be triggered (block 6 month later)?
sorry I don't have a technical background, however, completely addicted to btc
@_date: 2015-11-11 00:20:38
hahahah this is why I love reddit!!
@_date: 2017-05-31 12:22:05
ok thanks. I think it would be very nice to have that proposal ready before UASF. The UASF would act as pressure to implement the segwit+2mb proposal and we might finally come to an agreement without running into bigger troubles. 
UASF before the other proposal could lead to bigger problems, since it we'd have 3 options then which would make it harder to reach a consensus
@_date: 2016-07-09 12:38:57
yeah never underestimate the meteorite risk ;). Sounds good! This might sounds stupid but I just don't know really how to set up a paper wallet...
@_date: 2016-07-28 20:48:14
we will come back to you
@_date: 2016-07-09 12:10:38
It pisses me off because I just used it 2 times. This stuff should just work...
@_date: 2017-05-24 08:59:41
yeeeeeah right! at whatever fucking price when I introduced someone to btc they say, yeah but not just now. Because everyone who has just heard about an investment can of course time the market perfectly. A friend of mine told me that at 240.
@_date: 2016-07-09 12:43:23
Thanks but what is a usb 2.0? I have a fairly new MacBookPro and tried both ports...
The trezor does turn on, it's just that it only shows the trezor logo and  on my pc it still asks me to connect...
@_date: 2016-07-01 01:27:21
Fuck yeah! google trends shows clearly that the next bubble will probably be driven by people in poor countries where Bitcoin will start to adopt in a huge way.
(Or western investors anticipate that and jump on bord, doesn't really matter)
@_date: 2016-07-09 12:07:57
hahah wtf
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:09:24
I'm hoping for a miracle
@_date: 2016-07-01 09:15:48
that's actually a point! Still for example in argentina the minimum wage is not that low but they have currency issues constantly. Because of the fees it will probably start adopting as something to get out of the local currency.
Later we will have lightning network which will probably solve all these issues. Until then centralized solution which still uses Bitcoin to work international could come into plce
@_date: 2016-07-09 12:09:50
you want me to pay 500 bucks? People always say you should keep your coins offline. But it might be way more secure compared to its cost to just spread the coins to 5 different wallets and exchanges...
@_date: 2017-06-09 16:37:42
@_date: 2016-07-27 13:44:34
Yes we could try to negotiate a certain price per submitted post. We don't know yet how much work it is to find funny content. But it's not really in our interest to find someone just so that he quits after an hour. So it is in our interest to pay a reasonable price.
 We'll look for content ourselves over the next few days and then we can decide how much we are exactly willing to pay exactly. Are you interested?
@_date: 2016-07-09 12:24:40
Yeah but still I don't want to spend 1000 bucks for that. How did you do the paper wallets? In 2013 I just found complicated explanations if you're not a e very very technical person. Since then I just kept my coins on a exchange since I didn't have that many. However now I seriously need to think about protecting them...
@_date: 2016-07-28 20:48:01
we will come back to you
@_date: 2016-07-09 12:20:18
Yeah I just did that. 
How do you store your coins?
@_date: 2017-06-01 08:59:27
my point is that at some point the debate will be solved by UASF. or lets say the incentives over time will change in a good way. miners can't block progress forever
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:24:33
is it then possible to vote on it already right?
@_date: 2017-06-24 13:09:27
Thanks but let me ask more precisely: I send 1 Btc to kraken. I opened a 2:1 leveraged (better?) position. What has exactly happened. 
Did they implicitly sold my coin, took that amount in USD as a collateral for a loan in order to buy 2 Btc?
Or is also my margin in Btc? 
these might be dumb questions. but I'm confused.
My case: I oppened a position at 1850 (more or less) with only btc in my account. I closed the position at 2563. Now I have still that coin in my balance and also 1454 usd in my account. which would equal the profit on 2 Btc. so far so good. but what about the coin I used as margin. Do I still have that now? that would mean I've made profit on 3 btc right?
@_date: 2017-06-26 12:34:00
@_date: 2016-07-27 23:23:07
Did you know that an indian assistant professor works for 4 usd per hour with a phd? 
I'm actually working on a other more longterm project to build something using Bitcoin to create opportunities for people like that (no ponzi-&gt; sounds so dubious when I say opportunities ;)).
But 5 usd per hour is really not nothing if you're living in a country with low prices.

We do link to other peoples content (with source and everything). So no you don't need to create content. you just need to find content that is funny and not already used everywhere. Like blogs from other countries, small newspapers, online communities...
