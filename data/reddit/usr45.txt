A way to prove that they didn't identify the real Satoshi would be to observe him not using the internet, publicly release a nonce for the real Satoshi to sign, and then to observe a signature for the nonce gets released without the observed Satoshi using the internet.

Yeah, idk if coinapult is a trusted service or what, ie no raw transactions, just commands to a bitcoin "bank".  The only hitch I can see is that transactions would take up a lot of data (esp base 64 encoded) so if you don't have unlimited texts the twenty or so text messages you'd have to sent (Fermi estimated) could be costly.

It'll pay for itself eventually.  Whether or not it's worth it depends on your time preference.  Since mining is very competitive, I imagine that if solar miners were worth must people's time preferences, it'd be reflected in the hash rate, and made just barely/not for most people worth it.
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but if you're doing it as a hobby - go for it!  Unlike hashrate, the pride of owning bitcoins you "made" is non-rivalrous.

While there are a few people in this thread who are discouraged by Africa's desktop computer literacy, I think that won't be a problem if non-desktop devices, such as feature phones, become bitcoin capable.  I don't know about current sms bitcoin services, but it would be trivial to write an sms to bitcoin adapter service.  That would only work if the cell phone could be hacked to do ECDSA, but it could be hard to deploy.  Maybe it could work by word of mouth (ie get a friend to install a wallet).
I don't know about how easy or hard bootstrapping trust in bitcoin the currency would be.  Arguably it hasn't happened in the west either.  You'd need a kernel of true believers willing to pay fiat for bitcoin, if not an exchange.  The former world be limited and couldn't just be conjured up and banking regulation may make the latter difficult.
Maybe a "Yolo, ignore regulations, deal only in money orders" approach could work for exchanges.
Edit: one killer app for bitcoin in Africa could be a weather and crop futures market.  Anyone could implement it, though I don't know if non-tenant, non-subsistence farmers would already have access to those markets anyway.

You're a fucking hero, man.
In all seriousness, if you can drive the price up while it's too low and push it down when it's too high you're reducing volatility.  This means that you're helping increase the usability of bitcoin as a currency which means you're helping bitcoin fulfill its purpose AND at financial risk to yourself.

NashX is a special escrow site that facilitates transactions by holding money for both parties.  Then, unless both are satisfied, it releases the funds, otherwise it destroys them.
For example, say there's a XBT/cash transaction (Say, someone wants to sell 1 XBT for $100).  Both parties would give NashX, say, 2 XBT.  NashX would keep that until both parties say they are satisfied with the transaction, otherwise the surety bonds are destroyed.
That way, the Nash equillibrium of the contract is for people to not cheat each other, lest they lose out on even more money.  My criticism of it is that it just changes the game to [chicken](  That's only a weak criticism since the majority of scammers are people looking for a quick, low-risk buck rather than wanting to drive tractors at each other.

In neo-medieval times, transactions and blocks will be sent to villages in the form of letters on horseback.  The target will be changed to add a new block every month.

Maybe "because the next problem depends on information found in the solution of the previous one, so no one can place arbitrary problems for other to solve.  If someone solves a different problem or a problem that someone else chose, no one will care since if just any problem were recognized then there'd be no real limit to mining because people would just choose easy problems, or ones that they had secretly solved previously."

We're in the fourth bubble right now.  It'll go up to around 28 or so, then fall slightly so that the price fits the broad exponential growth you can trace when you ignore those four bubbles.
In the long run it'll expand to 21M/(Worldwide M0) with a logistic curve, assuming no political crisis happens to delay it (such as shutting down of exchanges, intentional FUD campaigns, or criminal penalties over substandard evidence for using exchanges or owning BTC).
EDIT: one other long-term challenge for BTC is its scalibility problems, but I imagine that when transaction volume gets large enough such that that's a problem the market cap will be high enough for banks (existing or to be founded) to start caring and brokering transactions.

No, the aggregate revenue (in bitcoin) per block is determined completely by net transaction fees and the prize to miners.  That's because by the definition of bitcoin every time a block is discovered, that's what goes to that lucky miner.
Certeris paribus, a decrease in electricity price will mean that the bitcoin network will use more electricity.  According to this model, as the price of electricity goes toward zero, the energy consumption will increase without bound.

Think about it this way. After you pay the interest, which is a must, you have a choice between reinvesting your funds in expanding operations, getting a guaranteed return by amortizing the loan, or speculating the bitcoin/dollar exchange rate.
Your decision should be based on whether you'd prefer a guaranteed return equal to the interest percentage you're paying on your loan, or some uncertain, but possibly larger, payout due to exchange rate fluctuations.
Since you have a mortgage and therefore a lot to lose, I'd recommend having a low tolerance for risk. I would at least keep an emergency fund in dollars, in case your mortgage payment is due during a dip so you don't have to liquidate your bitcoins at an unfortunate time.

In the context of this problem, enforcement costs make up the part of the transaction costs that matters.  I think it's safe to assume that the cost of bargaining with a landfill owner is negligible.  You had previously stated that dumpers dumped to avoid transaction costs, but the dumping ground has to bear the costs of enforcement, so I thought you were confused.


Public choice theory must still be considered because state action can only be efficient when it correctly assesses social costs.  You need public choice theory to model how the state decides to deal with an externality.  The MMS let BP drill where it later spilled oil was because it wasn't an all-knowing selfless entity.  To ignore public choice theory is to ignore the possibility of regulatory capture.


You can't use the inefficacy of a state run court system as an argument against a private court system.  Trying to equivocate the two is preposterous.  The rest of the paragraph criticizes the status quo of tort law, so I won't take it seriously because it ignores the differences between public and private law, which I cover later when talking about the question of fairness in private law three paragraphs down.


That's a non-unique argument, the public sector can't squeeze blood from a stone either.  Class action addresses the coordination problem - I did not claim that it would solve insolvency problems.


If you claim that a potential polluter will make an offer in exchange for being held harmless for pollution, then you just admitted that bargaining works.  Arbitration clauses and class action waivers only exist in the context of pre-existing agreements, while being polluted can never be voluntary.  They are two disjoint scenarios.


There's no reason to believe that a single person would choose to negotiate directly with a corporation, since the risk of having legal standing in a dispute is insurable.  I'm using the 7 criteria on wikipedia for the definition of insurable, and title insurance is a real world example of insurance against legal risks.  When two private DROs coexist, then it is in both firm's best interest to agree to liability rules that maximize the total utility between their two clients (even though it means taking utility from the plaintiff and awarding it to the defendant), since in the long run each DRO expects to represent many plaintiffs and defendants.  One organization will represent the combined interests of many consumers and its behavior is influenced by all potential customers.  It's the mechanism that makes negotiation at the societal level possible and is in no way comparable to the current public legal system.


The state has existed since before externalities have.  In the case of the [Aral Sea]( or [Four Pests Campaign]( it can be the worst destroyer of the environment.  The reduction in pollution in modern days is because the government switched approaches to the problem.  Regulations weren't effected until the environment came into the public consciousness and you admit that its feckless administration of tort law prevents people from settling externalities efficiently.  My proposed solution to externalities is better because it results in a competitive market for reducing transaction costs in the form of legal and monitoring costs (while regulation and public law tort can only reduce one of the two, respectively) and is immune to regulatory capture.

No, transaction costs are the costs associated with enforcement of property rights.  Dumping avoids having to pay the price of disposal.


That's not what public choice theory has to say about that.  If benefits are concentrated and there's a fixed cost to voting then laws will tend to favor special interests.  Thankfully, many externalities are visible enough so that it's difficult to trick voters into not caring about them, but if democracy were sufficient for preventing inefficient decisions with concentrated benefits and diffuse costs then there would be no pork barrel spending, protectionism, or subsidies.


The fact that the means of dispute resolution you gave as an example is a state court plays into my previous point that externalities can't be efficiently resolved when the means of resolution are government monopolies.  It's an example of swapping one form of state failure for another.
If a government agency is put in charge of resolving externalities, then it is still subject monitoring costs.  If those costs were too high for private individuals to keep track of these externalities, then having government agencies to undergo them would also be a waste of resources.  Worse yet, if no one can make a profit off of helping to resolve externalities, then monitoring technology will not be effectively developed.  We're just going to have to trust the agency to be innovative and go the extra mile when fulfilling its mandate.
For coordination, class action and clearinghouses are well known methods of coordination  Even if the situation is a hundred factories emitting pollution a hundred thousand people's homes and doing a penny's worth of damage each, it's not going to result in ten million lawsuits and a ten million checks.  Markets develop institutions to deal with their environments, and people will choose DROs that negotiate efficiently and pass the savings on to their customers.
I'm not saying that transaction costs don't exist, I'm saying that the state still can't overcome them.

Why not just use the blockchain to store a cryptographically secure hash of the ledger state?  Since you can't think of anything else that hashes to that hash and since that hash has to be valid since it's last in a chain of a proof of work, that means you could trust any old ledger state you download.
Double spend could be solved by having miners keep a trailing history of n blocks and then everyone would just set their transactions to expire n blocks in the future.
This would solve the evil data problem of the blockchain since it's impossible to predict what'll go into that blockchain.  If someone tried putting evil data into the ledger state by using vanity addresses, there's no reason other people couldn't corrupt that data by making their own vanity addresses.
This would also dramatically reduce the space overhead, since it'd be constant instead of linear with respect to the number of transactions completed.  It could open up new types of transactions and help the network scale, too.
There's got to be some reason why it's unfeasible, but I don't know what it is!  This is bugging me!

Bitcoin is a ledger that everyone has a copy of and to which changes may only be made by submitting proof by the person losing the money that they want the transaction.  Credits from nowhere come onto the ledger by awarding those who have solved hard math problems, so that the rate at which new coins are distributed is fair and not all at once.  Finally, the accounts are numbers, and there's a special cryptography trick you can use to prove that a message came from that number.
That's as best an explanation I can give in three sentences that covers BTC's fundamental nature and how it's produced.
