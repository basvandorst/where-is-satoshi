If you're a fuckin' millionaire, then yeah you can invest a higher percentage.
But if you're an ordinary person with an ordinary salary? Why the fuck would you ever invest a large amount of everything you have? Even if it's a good investment, it's just flat out stupid, because if Crypto fails, which it could, that means your house, car, and food is gone. For a millionaire, they don't give a fuck because they'll still have all those things and extra.
But yeah, age is a big factor as well. If you're a 19 year old kid with $5k, fuck it, just go all out. You're only 19, you have a nice, long, dead-end middle class working life ahead of you

Yeah, I guess in America healthcare costs are the only reason you'd wanna be a rich, old person. Luckily, the US is only one of many countries in the world, and in most other (western) countries, they'll get proper treatment for little or no money at all.

What does an old person need a lot of money for, anyways? Even as a young person, being rich only means a few nice cars and expensive alcohol, that's pretty much it lol. I'm pretty sure whether I made $40k/yr or $400k/yr my happiness level would be just about the same, at any age. There's diminishing returns on income, when it comes to happiness. Once you can afford normal life, all the extra income doesn't do much for you. Maybe gets you laid every once a while, but that's about it.

I'm sure most people on Reddit will tell you your $5k at 19 becoming $85k at 65 is a good thing, but that's just kinda silly in my opinion. 40-60 years from now on, we don't even know what world will look like. We don't even know if USD will still even be a currency. Hell, we don't even know if the USA will still even be a country. Long term investments are just kinda.. dumb. I'd rather be young with money, than old with lots of money

So you're saying the first people who came up with idea, invented, thought of, and mined cryptocurrency like Bitcoin were some rich multi-billionaires? Some rich people *did* invest into Bitcoin, effectively raising its price, but I don't think that's how it became what it is
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:29:08


That would be 100x better than what OP is doing. Actually, what if the price of BTC is super high when OP gets paid, and then stabilizes later on when he needs to cash it out to USD? He would lose money that way for no reason.
I can understand doing this if BTC was = to USD, but it's not. You can't fucking pay for 99% of things in BTC. Plus there's fees and exchange taxes associated with constantly switching BTC to USD then BTC then USD again, even if that fee was as low as 0.1% it would add up to a lot over time. Plus, for various tax reasons it's not smart for ALL of your money/salary to be in BTC
As much faith as you have in BTC or want to have in it, this is just dumb. Fuck, even if BTC was a stable currency it would be dumb to do it. I bet you can somehow negotiate with your employer to pay you in Euros too, instead of USD, but why the fuck would you do that?

Just being realistic. How can I be sure I won't win the lottery? You think Bitcoin is gonna go up to $10 million or something?
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:44:23
How many bitcoins do you have to have to be considered an investor, for flaunting purposes? 1? 2? 30?
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:21:55
I guess technically I can't, just like you can't say you won't win the lottery or you won't get struck by lightning in the next 34 seconds. At some decimal point, when something has an extremely unlikely chance of happening (or not happening), we just say it won't happen in the English language.. [see this](

Even people who invested at like $1k or $2k are not going to be suddenly rich unless they were already rich in the first place. You would've still had to invest well over $100k at $1k to have made $900k in profit. Very few people, actually almost none, can invest $100k; and the ones who could, most of them chose not to. Average people aren't really getting rich off of bitcoin; people who were already rich are getting richer for the most part. This is what sucks about capitalism.
But yeah, the more money you have the more you're going to spend. But it's not like the money *just* disappears, I bet all those people you mentioned have pretty nice cars and houses, even though they spent all of their fortunes.
And you know, there's other ways of becoming a millionaire besides being a business owner or just inheriting it. Every athlete you see on TV, every B or higher tier actor, almost every musician signed to a decently sized record label, hell even thousands of youtubers and streamers.. many of them make way more than $1m/yr. Average low tier doctors make a million every couple of years, high tier surgeons make millions in less than a year. Same with lawyers. Same with certain scientists. There's millions of ways to become a millionaire, and honestly you "only" need to make like $350k/yr to do whatever you damn want, including buying the nicest houses, the best cars, and traveling wherever, whenever you want.
So I say, don't put *that* much faith into Bitcoin, **at best** you'll make 5x or 10x more than you invested, which is an awesome financial cushion to have, but it won't make or break you. Figure out another way to chase money that you so much desire to have

But their risks are not the same as ours. If we lost even 10% of our networth or income, some of us could have trouble just affording food.
Some millionaires and billionaires can afford to lose 99% of their net worth and still have enough money to live in complete luxury, with cars/houses/food/servants/employees of their choice.
So investing is not exactly a "risk." A risk is having $5l2000 in your bank account, and investing $2000 into Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:19:23
This is soooo stupid. Even if Bitcoin continues going up, what if every time your boss pays your is during dips, effectively losing you 20%~ of your total income? Why would you just not get paid in $USD and then CHOOSE when/how to buy BTC?
I think you have autism man
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:57:25
Can you go into detail how this works? If I haven't cashed out any of my BTC into USD, there's no reason to pay taxes yet, or is there? It's not like I can/have used that money.
Also, how would you ever pay taxes on this? What forms would you have to use? And at point are taxes absolutely necessary to pay? at $1000 of profit? at $10,000 of profit? 
edit: hypothetically, what if I cashed out the BTC in another country that has lower tax rates and a different currency, is that legal/doable?
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:08:17
That's the thing that bothers me about capitalism, Bitcoin is essentially made, built, started and supported by the younger generation. 18 to 26 year olds. We made it, but we don't get all the profit from it. The rich fucks who had wealthy families for centuries are the ones who were able to invest $10m+ without blinking an eye, and literally became billionaires from it, while we're investing $500, $1000, $2000 and happy about it
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:12:16
This is the funnest thing I've done for a while. I don't even give a fuck if I lose it all. This shit beats casino gambling by far. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:25:00
So far so true, but it can still crash at anytime and you could lose all your money
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:02:16
I'm hyped about bitcoin as anybody else, but are people actually putting money in there they can't afford to lose? I just put a portion of my savings in it and see what happens; if I lose it, oh well too bad, if it skyrockets up, awesome, coke and lambos for me
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:29:57
I don't know, I'm getting a bad feeling that Bitcoin is just going to stay at around $9-10k for the next few weeks, and then eventually start dropping in value exponentially. It's never 'not' grown like this before, has it?
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:49:47
That's dumb logic, cuz neither of us know what it's value will be in Jan 2018. Hell, we don't even know what it's value will be 90 seconds from now.
I just don't think it will grow like it grew the past year, that would be nearly impossible. It's *possible* sure, but we're talking about some winning the lottery odds here. There is a higher possibility that it will just lose most of it's value quickly. Again, since both are possibilities I wouldn't bet on either one. 
I'd just do what I've been doing. Spend 70%~ of my leftover salary that I don't care if I lose on Bitcoin, and see where it goes. If it triples or more, awesome, I can buy a Nissan GTR. If not, oh well, who gives a fuck I can still afford a normal life
