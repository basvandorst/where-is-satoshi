They probably are... but like Hurd, it's gonna remain a joke for our kids to point at and laugh...

Expected better from GNU?
The day GNU releases modern software I'll eat my shoe.

Get a Trezor.

Reading through the API and Documentation I am reminded of the works of Lovecraft...
I especially like how they use git as part of the financial interface...

The Ethereum Code runs in a small VM called the EVM.
It's a 256bit Computer with a stack based byte code, compared to current register based 64bit Computers.
The Java VM has proven to be fairly resistant too and the only attack that can break out relies on [random memory corruption]( afaik.

probably min fee is set to 0

Thing is, the additional fees in paypal actually come with some nice things too, like ensuring both sides of a trade are satisfied (which the blockchain does not allow at all, no takebacks-payments).
It's uncompetive in the sense that for the price to pay for the right to use the blockchain, there are few benefits over PayPal or other similar big players.

Shame really, I like classic...

What if you want to sent 5$?
Or 50 cents?
If you want to do microtransactions, at 50 cents you pay almost 10% fee, that is uncompetitive.
The world is not made up of 500$ bills nor do many people earn that much money in a month.

The Halting Problem in Ethereum is solved by paying per execution step and having to provide some part of your accounts balance as gas for the execution seperately to the value of a transaction.
Atm it is possible to have a contract that runs infinitely long, but all blocks have a limit that is the moving average of consumed gas plus 25%.
Memory is limited too and even more expensive.
It is entirely possible to write a script that uses up all 2^256 bytes available to the EVM, but that costs more ether than will most likely ever exist.
The problem of infinite loops is not relevant on the ethereum blockchain.

Currently the light client protocol is under development but it exists.
There is no light client per se, but we have offline wallets that can serve the same purpose couple with a blockchain explorer.
PoS and sharding will make light clients easier actually, since it introduces transaction receipts, a light client would barely have to check the blockchain even compared to bitcoin clients.

Welche Uni?
@_date: 2016-05-21 18:38:37
I didn't say PayPal.

Simple; these are old transactions.
Nodes without 0 fees keep repeating transactions until they are invalidated by other transactions (such as my node)
Probably some part of it is spam, but a good part could be someone trying bitcoin and giving up in July 2015, or something similar, such things build up.

Got that too, ran it in a VM.
Sadly, the little bastard seems to be aware of some tricks and bluescreened the VM after blasting the harddrive.
Interestingly enough, even with a Bitcoin Wallet in AppData and running Electrum, it didn't do anything besides crashing the VM after a couple seconds. (Process Monitor just showed it looping)
