Lol... keep telling yourself that.

Thank you for linking me the Lehman Brothers wikipedia page. I see the benefit and rapid growth of crypto. I've been involved in the space over the last two years and think a lot of great work is going on. I was just stating that your reason for why banks are not allowing crypto purchases is incorrect. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 02:01:26
The reason behind banks not allowing their customers to withdrawal their money is not because the banks do not have enough cash. It is simply because of the risk associated with the crypto space. Banks  have regulations and laws they have to follow in order to ensure that the money they give out or hold isn't being used to finance terrorism or other unlawful activities. If you think it is because they don't have enough cash you simply haven't done any research on the banking industry...

Is that the fee for each bitcoin transaction
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:32:18
Poor graph choice. While there is strong growth the graph is somewhat misleading because of the vertical axis 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:58:26
I find it hard to believe you had 5 BTC at the time of the fork and weren't aware of how a fork works. If that is true and you believe in BTC I feel even better about owning BCH 
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:54:01
Shame on Coinbase for offering more coins to their customers. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:45:52
This sub is clueless. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:24:12
This is great and I completely agree with what you have mentioned. There is a lot of institutional money on the side waiting to get in or at least testing the waters. I'm hoping Square Cash will boost usage and adoption. Allowing their users to buy and sell BTC will be a big boost in adoption. I haven't done enough research yet but it would be awesome to see small merchants that accept credit card payments via Square also have the ability to accept BTC. It would be up to the merchant to decide if they would like to accept cryptocurrency. This wouldn't only help bring in new people to BTC by having an exchange platform but also for them to see the use of BTC
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:49:19
Pretty sure Bitcoin Cash needs to be more valuable than Bitcoin in order for it to succeed. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:35:20
I know this is supposed to be humorous and it is. I am a big believer in the original bitcoin but I think these hard forks and the divide in the community is not a good thing. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:28:02
Too bad it will take 30 minutes for his transaction to confirm 
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:55:58
Ok, this is helping me get a better understanding. What bitcoin will you support after the hard fork in November? Bitcoin Core I'm assuming. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:08:55
Yes, it is. Have you read Bitcoins original white paper? If you invested in BTC wanting this BCH is actually what you want. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:04:09
What makes you say this? Have you done any research to back your claim of two years?
This is the type of stuff that drives me mad about the crypto community which I am a part of. So many claims with no analysis or work to back it. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:27:05
did you deposit BTC to them prior to verifying?
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:43:01
Agreed the 10k marker is either happening in the next three weeks or not for a long time after that. Long being after the fork disruption... might not be BTC that gets there
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:38:23
Ok, I completely agree. I guess I was just questioning it because of your use of two years in your statement. What your saying is definitely a possibility but there is also a possibility that in two years BTC will be irrelevant. I'm not saying one is more likely than the other but I guess it is good to understand that your statement was really just a thought. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:13:15
My concern is that BTC isn't what people think it is anymore. Bitcoin was supposed to be a reliable p2p decentralized network. In order for a p2p network to be successful it needs to be fast and cheap. BTC is no longer fast and cheap due to increased volume. I am somewhat new to the crypto world but bought some litecoin/bch and transferred it to my nano ledger. It was way faster and cheaper. Again I am new and still own/support my BTC investment but am a little worried about the forks and the aftermath of them 
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:43:57
Ok, I completely agree with it is currently not a currency rather just a store of value. A very volatile one.Overtime it may become a currency.
What i mean by the p2p network being reliable is that it is quick and fast. I do disagree with you there. I think it is vital for a crypto to be able to do micro transactions. something which doesn't make much sense to do with BTC right now because of the high fees as a percentage of money transacted upon. Would you agree? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:07:07
Thats what I figured 2x does seem like a corporate coin. Bitcoin gold i down even know(would never invest in) and Bitcoin cash still interests me 
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:53:04
I am thinking about gambling a chunk of change if it gets to the $2,500. Can't really consider it an investment at this point...
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:10:35
Good thing there is only one cryptocurrency that can store value. Right???
@_date: 2017-09-26 02:41:59
Ok, those are reasons that I like to hear and I agree with. No need to get so sensitive... like i said in my first post I hope it continues to go up. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 00:50:42
This is the logic that scares me. People that think bitcoin will just go up because it has in the past. Bitcoins price in the long run will be highly correlated with its transaction volume. If people aren't using Bitcoin(p2p) I think its potential is being left on the table. Regulations pose a major risk for Bitcoin even though they are decentralized. You need the masses to understand and adapt them before the government makes it impossible for them to use. And no, I would not be shocked if China allows exchanges but they are regulated. I own bitcoin and am bullish on the future but sometimes I'd rather see steady growth than all this volatility. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:49:52
Yes, I understand this but the key assumption is that adding Coinbase won't increase demand. Coinbase is very easy to use and could have an effect on the demand. I'm not saying it will, I was just confused as to why access was being seen as a bad thing 
@_date: 2017-09-26 01:56:36
Yeah, speculation definitely plays a major role in the current value of BTC but speculation can only last for so long. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 21:20:28
I often see people claim a bull run is coming but with no evidence. What makes you believe this... I hope you are right. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:19:24
Makes sense, right now the demand is not there but same seems to be said for a lot of alts. At this next fork anyone holding BTC will also get the same quality of Bitcoin2x and Bitcoin Gold
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:20:46
The access of coinbase and usability of it is big. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:10:44
There is a barrier to entry in the fact that bitfinex isn't as friendly to use as coinbase. I have wanted to buy BCH but haven't because it isn't offered on coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:15:28
Ok makes sense, under the assumption that people want to sell. More people will have access to buy as well.
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:05:28
I was under the impression that Bitcoin Cash would be available to buy and sell on Coinbase on January 1st. I was wrong about that. 
My first argument was that everyone was assuming that when people get access to their BCH that they will sell right away. I thought when they got access they'd also be able to purchase BCH on coinbase
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:37:45
All about managing your risk
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:36:52
ah ok, i was under the impression that they would support trading. This makes sense then that cash will probably fall when all coinbase users get access to theirs
@_date: 2017-10-03 00:51:29
What is the benefit of a bitcoin ATM? Why not just buy on an exchange... Are the fees lower?
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:47:28
Why would more access = price falling. I don't think that makes much sense
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:40:52
Does this mean that Coinbase I will be able to buy and sell B2X on their exchange? I know I'll get the tokens but will I have the ability to trade them on it. 
Also what is their plan for bitcoin gold...
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:14:16
Ok makes sense, under the assumption that people want to sell. More people will have access to buy as well.
@_date: 2018-12-24 03:54:10
Why is this getting upvoted? It doesn't make any sense
