What exactly are you asking for? market research for 2btc? Or some simple answer? What is your app even? How about some details...

I'm about to make my first purchase with bitcoins. Here comes a year of reddit gold. Now to find out what it does. 
@_date: 2013-02-17 03:14:11
Just bought 10btc! They just restocked now I guess (10:15 p.m. EST)

Total Paid: 15500 µBTC
Total Pending: 500 µBTC

Happy cake day Internet stranger and distributer of bitcoins.

In my Q&amp;A someone is sure to ask about the security of bitcoin and how they can be sure their money is secured and possibly insured like it would be in a bank. How would you respond to this? 
@_date: 2013-02-15 13:43:15
Oh? I appreciate the advice. I haven't actually bought it yet, so I guess no harm done. I suppose you're *probably* right, assuming that bitcoin most likely goes up in the long term. Cheers.

That will definitely be a major point in the presentation. I am pretty well read up on bitcoin but I wanted to get a feel for what criteria specifically make people want to choose bitcoin over other currencies. This post is mostly to help give me an idea of what people find most beneficial about bitcoin so I can prioritize those points in my short presentation.

Very kind of you! Reddit is such a wonderful place. I'll return the favor when my coinbase transaction clears ;)
Cheers!

Just tweeted ya! Nice idea.

Could someone ELI5 this to me? If I wanted to gamble on this game, how would I go about doing it and is it worth it? Sounds like the player has the edge and should theoretically win in the long run? 
@_date: 2013-02-09 11:26:59
Same here :(
Seems like a neat idea. Hope the videos are available soon. I'm not buying this "few minutes things".

Man I hate bitcoins so much. Why are they worth like $27 right now? So stupid. 
@_date: 2013-02-20 17:41:27
I know you've written a thesis on the topic, but how confident are you? Would you be willing to predict a price for the end of 2013? How about the end of February? Also, are you personally invested in bitcoins? Mind disclosing how much if so?
@_date: 2013-02-16 18:03:07
How would we even conduct a transaction like that? How would I be protected? And how much of a premium?
@_date: 2013-02-09 11:31:58
Woot! Compulsiveness pays off! Just got 250 µBTC and it was easy as typing in a code, didn't even have to finish watching the video! 
This website should be fun :)
@_date: 2013-02-18 13:04:33
Thanks for taking the time to make this! Learned something and the day has just begun :) 
@_date: 2013-02-19 05:20:22
You could try  if you have a bank account that you can transfer funds from. There's a waiting period before you receive yours coins though to prevent fraud. 
Or if you want to use cash you can try  and send cash via moneygram to a bitcoin address. I think the website is down atm though. 
I know there's more ways but this is what I use and it works well for me :)
@_date: 2013-02-09 14:59:00
I can confirm that the bitcoins just got transferred to my coinbase account. A whopping .00275btc ($0.06USD) so far. I don't know if this is worth doing, maybe if bitcoins are worth a crazy amount someday I'll regret not continuing this but right now I'm over it. Goodnight people.

Very interesting read. Helps give you an idea about some powerful figures which could heavily manipulate bitcoin. Makes me skeptical to invest a large amount. I know everyone says don't afford to invest more than you can lose but that's really just a cop out for "We have no idea what is going to happen to bitcoin" and these Power users of bitcoins are one of the main reasons why.
@_date: 2013-02-16 18:22:44
Thanks for the honest answer. I went to a website like the one you mentioned, it advertises on this subreddit currently - bitcoinary. I'm pretty sure I encountered a scammer immediately, but it sounds contrary to what you are saying.
The person claimed to be selling bitcoins for $11USD which is a fucking steal if I might say so myself, and he said I could pay him via paypal and he does minimum transactions of 20BTC. I read paypal's Buyer Protection policy and it says it does not cover digital goods, so I'm not sure if I buy the chargeback thing. If that was the case, I could have potentially bought bitcoins at the incredible price of $11/btc AND charged it back? 
Sounds unlikely.
@_date: 2013-02-16 15:29:49
Does anyone know if there's a schedule for when they release more bitcoins? I really need to get some for a purchase I need to make and they're always sold out :(
@_date: 2013-02-18 13:14:56
What purpose does a site this this serve? How does the owner benefit? 
@_date: 2013-02-09 16:25:33
Best of luck working everything out. Wish I was knowledgeable on that stuff enough to help you.
@_date: 2013-02-09 11:53:06
Okay people, watch the videos. Lol. Just lost 250 µBTC for pulling the trigger early. Also, for people having payout issues, I'm using google chrome and everything is working fine. 
@_date: 2013-02-09 12:19:52
Can the owner of the site answer some questions? How long does it take to pay out on average? Is there a limit to how much can be earned per day? How long do new videos take to become available usually? Does that timer increase depending on how many you've already done? How long has this service been around? 
The site seems to be lacking a lot of info.
