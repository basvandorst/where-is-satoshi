It makes a lot of sense to store your coins in a way that you own the keys to them. With coinbase they own the keys, you only own a claim against them.
But for the love of god -- write down your wallet seed and store it in a secure location. Better yet: Store it in at least two physically separated locations (in case your house burns down).

Make sure they have no idea what the definition of *"all your bitcoins"* is and give them the key to *"some of your bitcoins"*.

I would not recommend using a website service as a bitcoin wallet because there's always the risk of them getting compromised and you losing your bitcoins in the process.
Get the Copay app for Android or iOS (or as an extension for Google Chrome). It's pretty much the best app out there.
Additional benefits: It's an HD wallet - so *you* are the only one with access to the keys of your bitcoin addresses. Also you can install the wallet on multiple devices.
If you *absolutely must* use a website: I've used  in the past.

If you would like to give bitcoin to friends or relatives I would strongly recommend using an hd wallet. Make a paper backup of their wallet seed and store it in a secure location. Otherwise it is more than likely they will forget or lose their keys.
There have propably been thousands -- if not millions -- of bitcoins irretrievably lost by uncaring (or unaware) owners.

ROFL. Yeah. Been there, done that. Welcome to tax hell. Good luck.
If you've been daytrading you should hire an accountant. No joke.
And no. Exchanges usually just give you a list of all your transactions so you'll have to do the Math yourself... If you're lucky and they're not gone when you're doing your taxes (see "Mt.Gox"). Make backups of their logs now.

A soft fork means the new rules are *stricter* than the old rules. In consequence, blocks adhering to the new rules will be valid blocks for nodes running the old *and* the new version of the software.
The problem for legacy nodes in this scenario would be that they might accept a block that would be invalid according to the new rules.

Great question: A bitcoin supply increase from 21 to 121 millions would be a hard fork because it *widens* the rules - old nodes would not accept those blocks/transactions. 
A soft fork would be "there are no more block rewards". Old nodes would accept blocks following those rules (because by the old rules the block reward is not fixed but capped at -- currently -- 12.5 BTC). But they would also accept blocks with a block reward of 12.5 BTC (because that's acceptable by the old rules) -- but those blocks would not be valid according to the new rules (so updated nodes would reject them). This can -- in the worst case -- result in a chain split.
