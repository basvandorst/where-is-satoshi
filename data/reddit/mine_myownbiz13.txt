I don’t think the way it looks is very important. It’s the thought that counts and this is a beautiful one. ��

The people who were able to retire didn’t get lucky, they knew what they were doing. You should be doing your research (homework) on bitcoin instead of wishing you would’ve gotten “lucky.”

But aren’t you mixing btc and personal banking if you use cashapp? They need to link to your debit/credit or bank account, don’t they?
Maybe I’m wrong, but I don’t think that’s the main purpose of Bisq and other decentralized exchanges. Isn’t the point to be able to trade crypto to crypto anonymously?
I’m assuming that once you go back into fiat, or into crypto with fiat for the first time, that you are going to have to “mix btc w/personal banking,” no matter what. 
Even if you transfer fiat from a decentralized exchange to an offshore bank account, you’d still be mixing the two, wouldn’t you.
I am I missing something here?

Bitcoin is an asset class. Its also a Trojan Horse. Bakkt and others will be bitcoin-settled, which means they will have to buy and hold BTC to establish their positions. This activity should take BTC’s market cap into the trillions while sparking the next phase of development and adoption. Eventually, in my opinion, BTC  goes from fringe asset to world reserve currency—at which point the slow process of eroding the power and reshaping the nature of the nation-state and financial system will have been well under way. Bitcoin is a Trojan Horse gifted by Satoshi to the nation states of the world. Long live the Revolution! ✊

“Enjoy being manipulated by unregulated bitcoin exchanges.”
�� are you serious? You do understand the “regulated,” centralized, fiat system manipulates general price discovery worse than any type of crypto exchange(s) ever could. A central point of Bitcoin’s value proposition is providing safe harbor from attacks on our money from centralized, manipulative institutions like banks and corporations. It does this by hosting as many independent actors as possible on its network. Here is some more info on the matter:

I’m fucking excited about it! We should all be fucking excited about it! If you’re not fucking excited about it, then you probably don’t fully understand what bitcoin is.

It is not an invalid argument to inform others that professional traders (people who work  at NYSE, CBOE, CME, etc) all use TA and, for the most part, no FA to make a living. This has been done since the turn of the 20th century (manually at first, and with the assistance of computers since the  1970s). These are facts. A person need only spend a day or two of investigation on the internet to confirm it for themselves. Again, people who argue what you are saying don’t know much about the subject.

Article doesn’t say. I also want to know how much?
@_date: 2019-09-08 14:35:52
If you are saying TA is the equivalent of flipping coins, you don’t know what you’re talking about...maybe I misunderstood...
@_date: 2019-09-08 13:38:10
I was going to write something long, but you basically nailed it. I’ll add, for all you TA-haters out there, that you can decide for yourself if TA is BS simply by watching Krown Crypto on YT. Go and see an NYSE professional (worked over 10 years on Wall Street as a market maker) use TA day in and day out to extract profit from the market. He’s been doing it since March 2018 with BTC,  and it hasn’t  mattered wether BTC goes up or down—it’s all the same to Krown!
Anyone who says TA is BS doesn’t know what they are talking about, and are probably just salty about not being able to understand it for themselves.

They are not financially literate if they think BTC is the ponzi. They’re actually financially illiterate, and the way you counter is by asking them how our money works—where does it come from, what gives it value? They will then spew misinformation and you will be able to enlighten them.

It’s clear you  don’t understand the economics of hodling and its effect on the underlying price of Bitcoin. Here are a couple articles you should read and try to understand:

This is what Trace Mayer says. I agree with both of you. It is, however, an anarchist/libertarian idea, IMO.
