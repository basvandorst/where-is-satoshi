I find Blockchain convenient, because I can access the same funds on any computer (  Not just my iPhone.
Its been fun looking at all the new wallets coming out recently.  Looking forward to Hive for iOS

Funny, but free wallets are what all wallet providers appear to be doing.  What else should a company compete on if not price?  Quality for one.

+1, still waiting on an update here.
also, glad to see Mycelium iOS
@_date: 2014-12-22 17:50:20
Good call.   I'm sure it is not by popular demand that them and others are implementing Paycoin.   I did not demand it lol

I don't think coinbase is the ethical money transmission police.  But we will see I guess
@_date: 2014-12-21 22:50:02
Shapeshift.io implemented the Paycoin into its trading mechanism pretty quickly.
I find this scary.  
Shapeshift, why?
@_date: 2014-08-24 00:14:25
Lol, there are plenty of people still waiting to try it ourselves.  
@_date: 2014-12-18 12:50:24
Thanks for the update

Who is Mr. Gox?

Hahahaha. What a joke.  To call any political leader something like this...  Wow.
@_date: 2014-09-10 21:59:11
Wow Hotshot,
What have you done for Bitcoin recently?
@_date: 2014-12-26 18:12:02
Thank you

Interesting thought.  But when you go to send funds, and type in the address or amount, it uses a new keyboard.  Idk
@_date: 2014-07-29 20:26:04
Wow, good one.
Have used the app?  Notice how it is actually (like I implied) not that great?
It is also not at all self-evident that tapping the transaction time will provide more information.
@_date: 2014-07-29 20:46:57
Well Blockchain.info does provide a good service.  Hopefully they will push another update, and we will all be fully satisfied
@_date: 2014-07-30 15:48:55
Yes, and how you can not view the full address once you have typed it in.  I find I have to click on their address to edit it, then I can view the end of the public key, but not the beginning.  I have to stop editing the address to view the beginning.

Looks like you can get an NXT or darkcoin one instead lolol
Paintings look very nice though, I agree.  (For abstract art) :)
@_date: 2014-07-29 14:51:54
Thanks.  Not sure how you figured that out lol
@_date: 2014-07-29 15:48:11
That would be a pain.  iOS version actually shows a converter on the Keyboard.  However, it is a guessing game.  Is it 0.012 BTC for $7.00?... no, maybe it is 0.0119 BTC... nope, maybe it is 0.0118 BTC... etc.

Hey, do you have a link to these points against nuclear?  I would be very interested to read about it.  Thanks!

If he pumps that scam again... seriously, fuck him.
