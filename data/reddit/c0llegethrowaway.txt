Good way to legitimize Bitcoin, no real argument but lots of ad hominem - so that even if you are right, you'll just make the people you're trying to convince more set in their beliefs. Nice man, let me try my hand at it:
You're a greasy neckbeard who has brainwashed themselves that Bitcoin is the future and can be used as a viable currency, and you use the thought that you will one day be rich as a coping mechanism to deal with your shitty life and mediocre career. You know that if you become rich, Bitcoin is the only way it'll happen, so you staunchly support it. You're not interested in crypto as a technology or a movement.

Well... Good job, congratulations on happening to live in an area where you don't need a car? 
How the fuck are you supposed to save up early when you're not making any money cause you can't get to work? And biking 20+ miles every day isn't realistic for most people. 
Also you're not helping yourself by not owning a credit card... Any responsible adult can use the card to only spend what they can afford and take advantage of the credit card rewards. 
Your views are very one sided and doesn't take into account people that can be responsible, that live in a country where things are spaced apart, or that are fine with the idea of paying interest.

I don't see what's wrong with getting an auto loan. What is the other option if you don't have any savings money because you're young? 
In my case, I'd have to walk 2-3 miles to the nearest bus stop (which I'm not sure even operates that early), take the bus to the metro, and take the metro to work. The whole ordeal would take like 2 hours, and ultimately cost like $14 a day. I could also take an Uber which would end up being $60 after accounting for rush hour traffic. And I live in a pretty average American suburb - if you're rural you **need** a car just to get anywhere. 
It's a no brainer to get a car loan in this case, which applies to almost all Americans not living in cities... The cost of the loan + interest + gas + maintenance might be slightly over $14 a day but you can do so much more if you have a car and you can get places in 1/4 of the time. The two hour commute in my example would be a half hour by car. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:59:20
Read over what I said again. I said it isn't unreasonable that they're taking out loans. The entire point of my argument is that to own a car you need to take out a loan if you don't have money. As for making money, having a car significantly facilitates that process in many places, so in these places you need to take out a loan. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:15:09
The people who'd get outraged by this post are the same people who circlejerk that they use a debit card because they're *so* financially responsible when they're denying themselves I) purchase protection, II) rewards, and most importantly III) the opportunity to build credit. 
I just don't understand why it's so hard for people to have a credit card but treat it like a debit card and only spend money that you have. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:01:33
Yep. And when you account for your time lost, the various Uber rides because of these holidays, and the risk of losing your job cause you don't have reliable transportation, an auto loan is more than worth it.

And it never will be a currency... Insanely high fees and slow TX confirm times make it infeasible. LN, segwit and future updates/proposals might change this but it's gonna be centuries before anything is implemented. Look at when LN/segwit were promised, and how far they are now from being implemented... We have segwit and nobody is using it, and there's still no sign of LN

I recommend *you* learn a little. The payment processor (electrum) had a nifty little button (child pays for parent) that allowed me to dispute the transaction and have the funds sent to a different address. It cost quite a bit in fees which was irritating, as USD processors like PayPal doesn't charge a fee on reversals.

Just like most other exchanges, it's still useless if you want to just buy and use bitcoin as a currency because back deposits take 5 days to clear
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:55:12
And why cant it be regulated? The government regulates what you can do with paper money, and its easier to hide your activity with paper money than with bitcoin, where all your transactions are visible online. To make it worse, your wallets and addresses are tied to your identity via exchanges. 
If the government doesnt want you buying drugs with bitcoin, for example, there is no reason they cannot enforce that. They already do. The technology allows you to do whatever you want, as with paper fiat. They can still make certain activities illegal.

No, I understand they are two very different companies. I am trying to have the bank reverse the transfers to coinbase and kraken. 
I am considering contacting Electrum and having them reverse the transaction, but I am having trouble finding their contact info. This is quite frustrating because I invested most of my college fund in Bitcoin, and frankly if I put my money in stocks and bonds there would be no worry of hacking.  
Methinks you are very financially illiterate and cannot help me if you think that a bank could reverse a Bitcoin transaction, so kindly stop replying.

If they wanted to catch everyone who torrents, they could do it pretty easily. They just don't care. A lot of ISPs catch torrenters.

Post the science, please. Current bio major and from my impression, we still don't know wtf goes on in sleep. There's a hypothesis that dreams result from the brain interpreting random electrical noise, which I think you might be referring to. But that doesn't mean the interpretation is also random -- it could be that your brain is using your memories and other associations to interpret random electrical noise. 
I think this is one of those things we just don't understand, and dreams may very well not always be random. I know people don't like anecdotal evidence, but I think it's a reasonable way to point us toward a hypothesis that we should actually scientifically test: When I'm stressed about finals I have dreams about missing my alarm. Sleep talking is just when your body doesn't properly paralyze itself while you're dreaming so you act out your dreams, so if dreams aren't random, neither is sleep talking.

Yeah but what's the point if you can't withdraw it until (at least) 5 days later. I don't want to wait 5 days to be able to buy something.
That wait is fine if you're looking to use Bitcoin as an investment or store of value, but really bad if you want to use it as a currency. I guess the technology has just evolved over time and now it's more of a digital gold type thing.

Saying not to trust investment advice is still technically investment advice
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:08:49
I never said it's the same, just that it falls into the same category. As you said yourself, is still *advising* you to do something that relates to *investing* hence it, by definition, being investment advice. I don't know why so many people are having trouble with the basic logic behind the concept. 
Rape and consensual sex are still both sex, but that doesn't mean they're the same thing.

Because when the first person pointed out it's investment advice, and the second person said he was wrong, I came in to show that he was, in fact, not wrong. To do this I had to be literal. 
Person 1: You know, OP, that's technically investment advice  
Person 2: no it's no.  
Me: by definition it is, though 
And fyi I'm a biology undergrad looking to go to med school, which is pretty far from engineering
And P.S. I get what you're trying to say, that OP's investment advice is better than most other advice because it encourages you to think critically and come to your own investment decisions. That doesn't mean it's not still investment advice. It's just good advice.

The banking system is definitely corrupt and stealing our money but overdraft/balance fees are not how. and in the time it takes for someone to complain on the internet about fees they could switch banks online.

Even if you plan to hold, buying at the top still hurts you since you could have gotten more BTC after the dip which would be worth a shit ton if BTC hits 10k+. 
Every time there's media hype around bitcoin is the worst time possible to buy if you're in it for the long game IMO. I feel like people don't understand that the bubbles are a cyclical trend with bitcoin. It's neither good nor bad. It's just how this shit works. The important part is that the long term trend is upward, and that bitcoin has a strong inherent value to it. 
If you're buying to hold, wait until things are quiet. Wait until you don't see bitcoin on the news and your friends aren't talking about it. That's when it's going to be the cheapest.
