Mainstream is barely catching on, this is just the beginning.

I know right? Ive never heard of a woman looking to ‘date’ a wealthy man before.

You can use the funds instantly.. literally moments after selling.

How long have you been waiting for the ‘dip’?

Decide to mine Bitcoin 7 years ago

Bitcoin laptop treasure hunt

Laptop empty, Sheldon moved them to a USB stick on one of the dude’s keychain unbeknownst to him
Guy lost keychain years ago
Comic store guy finds USB stick and wipes it and sells it for $10 cause Batman USB sticks are worth $10 apparently

Dec 18th? Might be paying double by then.

This is only good advice if you don’t plan to invest any more. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:35:08
Hopefully this encourages you to look into some safer investments like 401k and Roth. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:02:12
Curious, if you bought three back then with such strong belief and watched it grow, why didn’t you invest more at any point?
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:25:49
My god that man might have to regurgitate his testicle and tape it back on!
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:47:45
Maybe he trusts a team of professionals dealing with millions of customers to keep his BTC safe as opposed to his accident-prone and forgetful self.

How much did you buy in for prior to dumping at 9.8? That determines a lot here. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:33:05
Panic is setting in for our newfound investors.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:34:53
~990,000 now 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:40:18
So bitcoin market cap of 20 Trillion USD. Seems legit. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:57:57
That’s awesome, congrats. 
HOWEVER, I highly recommend deleting this post and never speaking of how much skin you have in the game. Especially if it’s that much.. The internet is scary man. Good luck to you.

BTC has been overrun with novice “investors”. They hype up the man who says BTC $40k next year without hesitation and ignore/downplay the sensible/weary analysts. Not to say which side is right or wrong, but it speaks volumes on how you should approach the BTC userbase. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:50:36
Well they better enjoy it while they can if that’s the case, because people will flock to the exchange that boasts better uptimes and makes good of it. They’d be idiots to lose out on the credibility they have going.

I too have always been a fan of ketchup on my cookies.

Til 1am PT is what it said for me. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:36:59
Got some sell orders you need to get through? ;)
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:03:10
Congrats. What exchange did you sell on if you don’t mind me asking?
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:24:18
If that’s all the savings you’ve got and having double that would put you over the moon, then no this is not at all a wise choice.

@_date: 2017-11-30 00:11:10
Hey no worries, I didn’t think you were being hostile at all. I agree, it’s all very exciting in general. Best wishes. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:20:16
Still the same orange yellow on my app (iOS).  
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:52:54
Think about you are asking... If that were the case we could all invest everything we have and be guaranteed ridiculous profits. Guaranteed free money, and lots of it? Not exactly. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:23:14
OK, that was pretty good.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:43:54
If this were real we’d be on the precipice of 100k BTC.

And when people tell you to BUY! BUY! BUY! it generally means they want to SELL! SELL! SELL!
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:24:01
We are on the precipice of mainstream audience awareness/interest. With the influx to be expected in the coming months, I only see it going up in the end (I wouldn’t be surprised if we saw a few more 8/9k dips in the next few days though). 
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:16:03
Wondering the same..
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:18:55
Yeah that is unfortunate. Although it is only buying/selling that is down so really you guys can cover basically everything else. The actual buying part is the easiest haha
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:48:04
My entire point is that it’s exposure to many people who probably wouldn’t know of Bitcoin (or at least have a basic understanding of it) prior to seeing the episode. So yeah, that’s where the optimism comes into play here. 
My initial post was meant to be a stretch, but it certainly can’t hurt to give it this sort of exposure. That’s all I’m saying really. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:20:06
People are gonna say ‘wow, it’s worth $5k‽’ and then after the episode they’ll see it at $10.5k+ and think ‘my god it doubled in 20 minutes since the show’ and FOMO sets in.
