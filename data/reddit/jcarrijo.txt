Thank you for your quick analysis. Sorry I got scared and the title reflects that. I can't change the title anymore though.
I should note that it isn't only a display bug. The wallet user is actually prevented from not only seeing, bug also from controlling the funds, having to use a third-party software (as I did) if he wishes to move them, until the fix is provided.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:35:42
I did similar to that using:
The address does not appear!
If you use Samourai, I recommend, as a precaution, that you recover that seed somewhere else, and empty your wallet.
If you could leave just a small amount and make a test transaction (make sure you have the last Samourai wallet version) to check if this problem occurs, it would be great.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:53:38
Thank you for trying to help.
See the edit.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:41:52
The address is controlled under the same seed / pin combination, so, yes, it is mine, but I had to use third party software to see and access the funds.
Scary, but temporary setback. Once the devs provide an update, users will see and control the funds normally.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:13:33
No, it's not. It's a Motorola Moto Z, updated to the last Android version.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:31:11
Thank you for all your work, I'll continue using and supporting Samourai. Sorry for the panic.
You know what's funny? The address generated was:
Its first letters were Sbug, like in Samourai Bug. lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:35:42
I wish I could change the title.
It really felt like my funds were stolen until I figured out what happened, and I thought the right thing to do for users was to be clear to them about the possibility of theft.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:28:49
I tried to recover the seed into a non-segwit BIP39/44 tool to check if the non-segwit address appears, using this:
I tried different paths
But none of them seem to control the address to which the funds went.
So probably this was not a bug, the funds seems to have indeed been STOLEN!
@_date: 2017-03-13 18:28:39
Really not how it works. The average block time won't be much affected if there is a brief peak in hash rate at the end of a cycle.
@_date: 2017-03-13 13:54:55


Hashrate isn't the only variable. If the price of BTC is sufficiently higher than the price of BTU, miners will have the incentive to mine on the BTC chain, even if it is momentarily slow.
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:34:12
I'm with you, just a little bit more concerned that a fork won't yield a winner and a loser, but two losers.
@_date: 2017-03-22 02:38:00
How much are they paying you?
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:32:45
Also remember BU will itself have 13,3 minutes avg block time. It is 3x faster, not 4x.
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:29:53
It doesn't have to be 4x higher. Miners know the slowdown is temporary, and after next difficulty adjustment it will become just as fast as BU. I think if the price is like 50% more (it's up to the subjectivity of miners), this would be a strong signaling by users about what token they chose, and they might switch back to Core chain, alleviating and abbreviating the slowdown in a virtuous circle.

I think nobody can promise the end of backlog, and if they do promise that, I agree that it is shortsighted.
You realize, though, that arguing against a particular team of implementation of on-chain scaling is different than arguing against general on-chain scaling, right?
@_date: 2016-12-07 21:15:18
Because right now there's thousands of times more money to harvest from financial institutions in denial, than from actual bitcoin users.
It's simple. Banks have enormous piles of money. They depend on the current system to exist, because they are the system.
Banks have the same incentive to invest in its own disruption as Kodak had to invest in digital cameras, or Blockbuster had to invest in Netflix (they had the chance to buy it but turned away).
And they have all the incentive to show their stockholders that they are investing in innovation, and to signal there's no threat by ridiculing the threat, and by claiming they are building a much better version of "distributed ledger technology" than this libertarian experiment called bitcoin.

cause if you didn't, the above statement will look pretty bad on you.
@_date: 2016-12-07 21:02:09
It's a huge risk, actually. Especially here in Brazil. Everyone here who sells at LocalBitcoins is familiar with the risks, because they all have been burnt at least once.
The risk isn't the person claiming a chargeback. The risk is that it wasn't actually the account owner making the transfer, but a hacker who managed to steal the bank access information.
The bank hackers used to buy physical stuff P2P such as cellphones on ebay like sites, but since bitcoin, there's nothing better for this thieves to turn their phishing into money in their hands.
I have been scammed five times this way, and had three bank accounts shut down for being involved in a "fraudulent transaction".
In my opinion, unless Bitsquare provides some sort of reputation system or even KYC, it will never take off or be useful, for there are so many scammers out there.

@_date: 2016-11-24 01:44:10
If you're buying, say 20 pounds, the difference from one exchange to another will be some pennies, which is neglegible to most people, then price wouldn't be the main deciding factor, it could be convenience, for example.
But the larger the purchase, the more the price becomes a relevant criteria.
@_date: 2016-11-22 13:31:19
Your best argument was guessing I'm a BU supporter and see if the bait goes.
Actually not an argument, but a cheap tactic.

The way the network is now and the way the scaling debate is going, adopting bitcoin is like gambling, specially if you are a business evaluating accepting it, even more if you are an enterpreneurer seeking to build something over bitcoin.
It's an extremely complex, multi-faceted game with thousands of variables at play.
Whoever argues smaller blocks are better, should be able to argue that even smaller blocks would be even better (which can be done via soft fork), or otherwise prove the equilibrium point considering all variables at play is 1MB (or any other specific number). Otherwise, we should all be humble enough to acknowledge there is too much complexity to forecast with certainty what is the best block size.
And given a future probable uncertain risk, and given a current visible pain that is hurting users now, it's kind of a no brainer.
Also, arguing that in the future we won't have a constant backlog at first looks absurd to me. The more transactions we have, the greater the sample, the more we can predict patterns. Wallets distribution will be known, the average number of transactions, sazonality, fees distribution, total hashing power, difficulty, hashing power distribution and delta tendency. All these becomes easier to forecast the greater the sample is, because outlier behavior (attacks, spams, etc) will get dilluted among the huge mass of ordinary transactions.
It seems to me competent miners, as it is today, will have plenty of information, deductible directly from the blockchain itself, to plan.
Add to that the expectation that miner hardware will hit Moore's law, thus the predictability in the hashpower change will increase.
I'm in favor of segwit as I'm inclined to be in favor of any proposal which provides an immediate relief to this awful experience of uncertainty we are subjecting bitcoin users to, especially newcomers. I saw today someone here on who seems to have lost coins sent by helix grams light mixer with a 0.0001 fee, which never confirmed, just as an example.
Still reading the paper, though.
@_date: 2016-11-23 12:07:53
Anyways, it is much more "yours" than money on a bank or from a credit card.
@_date: 2016-11-23 13:58:19
I think what he should have said is Core's practical action has being of not increasing from 1MB since forever.
@_date: 2016-11-22 17:29:55
Also, the paper's focus is to argue against the elimination of the block reward. It advocates that a transaction fee only system is bad. It's not a paper in favor or against limiting block size.
"the model of Bitcoin that we analyze is after the block reward has dropped to zero. That is, transaction fees are the only source of revenue for miners, and we model available transaction fees as arriving to the Bitcoin system at a constant rate."
Have you read it? (honest question)
@_date: 2016-12-02 17:23:49
If you're usind an HD wallet (most wallets are), for this to work you'll have to send all your bitcoins back to yourself.
And this introduces a privacy issue, since it gathers all your previous unspent outputs in a single transaction, producing stronger evidence that those addresses all belong to the same person than would otherwise be possible with chain analysis.
Just have this in mind.
@_date: 2016-11-22 12:58:19
Ordinary users can always stop using bitcoin if it doesn't suit their needs.
It is not legal tender. And if ordinary users don't use it, what good would it be to a business to accept bitcoin?
It's analog to the internet. The protocol is in the hands of big corporations, hardware manufacturers, telecoms. And though not an utopia, the Internet is an astounding success.
This is because all of those big businesses are slave to customers. If customers, ordinary people stop being served, they stop using it in favor of something better to them.
We are looking at 20 yrs+ of corporations and govts trying to hijack the internet. Yes, they tried a lot. It's just that it is an unstoppable force.
@_date: 2016-12-08 16:54:02
I'm also very thankful to them.
If I were them, I would not carry on my shoulders the burden of a choice so prone to be wrong as a block size limit.
If I were them, I would deliver open-source free-market spirit software which delivers CHOICE. And let someone else take the bullets.
If I were them, I would be humble to just recognize I cannot forecast the future without it being just a guess. Nor hardware and bandwith improvements, nor the brilliant solutions to the full node incentive problem that people all around the world can come up with. Neither I nor anyone can state anything for sure when it comes to forecasts.
If I were them, as we use to say here in Brazil, I would push the "screw it" button.

It is about a protocol, wich is a particular type of business logic. Are we arguing about the meaning of the term business logic? Cause we could use any other u want.
@_date: 2016-11-21 20:34:26
People who runs full nodes are free to stop running them. If they do because, say, the chain is too big to store, the absolute number of nodes will diminish (and this is what matters, not the percentage).
What everybody seems to ignore too is that when this happens (# of nodes diminishes) it raises the incentive for the same "piggybacking financial services" to run their own full nodes, since the lesser the # of nodes, the less you can trust the network with a pruned/SPV node. And the cost to run a node is irrelevant to those businesses, let's face it.
I think this is a concern that only exists if you look at one side of it (impact on voluntary charitable people who run nodes to help bitcoin because they want a better world) and completely ignore the other side (businesses who have enough sums of money at stake not to trust a network if it is composed only of a bunch of centralized nodes, and thus will run a full node themselves).

They could indeed do some sort of KYC, just like even being just a protocol, they provide arbitrage services. There would be the need for a new actor, a ID validator, who would himself have a reputation (just like the arbitrator model is today in bitsquare).
Not that this would be a good idea, but it is not impossible.
But unless this is resolved somehow, a centralized service such as LocalBitcoins will continue to be the best option for someone who wants to buy bitcoins peer to peer.
@_date: 2016-12-08 03:26:57
I'm a fan of bitsquare, and I'm pointing out this issue because it is in my opinion a huge barrier to adoption.
I never like using LocalBitcoins, because they could all the sudden hand over information under a subpoena.
But this hacker cash out concern is a major one amongst fellow LocalBitcoiners in Brazil. And unfortunately, bank transfers are by far the most convenient and used way to buy bitcoins.
Try and visit LocalBitcoins selecting to buy in Brazil. You will see that every single reputable bitcoin seller requires ID verification. And there is a reason for this. At the moment you place an ad without this requirement, the scammers will place a bid.

The point would be to send a message, and to undermine confidence in cryptocurrencies as a whole.
People allocate their investments in bitcoin only because they trust its resilience.
After such an event, people, investment funds, companies, would be more hesitant to get involved with anything "blockchain", and would probably go to alternatives, such as gold, centralized services and central bank "backed" currencies.

@_date: 2016-10-13 03:02:44


LN activated != LN mainstream adopted.


Nobody cared back then. They seem to be waking up to Bitcoin's potential.


This government wouldn't be destroying the value of their own capital. They would be protecting its monopoly on currency creation, destroying competition, under some costs which would be borrowed from future taxpayers.
Also, destruction of capital is what governments do all the time, especially in wars.


Why do you think gold was confiscated during the 29 crisis? Why do you think they ended the gold standard worldwide? Gold was a menace to the endless money creation of a fractional reserve system.
Every currency is a threat to every other currency. It's called currency wars for a reason. If a significant part of an economy shifts from fiat to bitcoin, there would be less fiat users for the same amount of currency, which would lead to a devaluation of the currency (hyperinflation). It the dollar stops being used as a reserve currency in favor of, say, the yuan, what do you think will happen to the dollar? It's the same if ppl start using bitcoin for real.


It is a threat to the state as much as cash is a threat to the state.
@_date: 2016-10-13 02:48:48


But what could they really do about it? They do not have unlimited money available to counter-purchase, otherwise they'd be already doing it now, since it's currently profitable to mine with S9's.


I would always buy the most efficient hw available, wether it's a new bitmain hw, or a competitor's.
If my intense purchasing moves the price up, it would make it more expensive to me and also to the other miners.
If it creates competition and moves the price down (flooding the market) I would be benefited as well, being able to buy much more with the same money.
Also, I'm the one with the money printer, and I can always borrow from future generations and print an extra billion dollars.


There are many power plants that operate under their full capacity. On the given premise of an "energy plentiful country", it would be just a matter of activating the idle capacity.


If they actually anticipate this, wouldn't it increase risk perception? I mean, would really every miner go all in with their life savings and bank credit when they clearly see a plot like that taking place?
@_date: 2016-10-13 02:14:38

The idea is that your client in, say, the US buys bitcoin with his dollars, sends you those bitcoins, and then you would sell them for rupees.
For instance, say your client has $1000 to send you. Right now, he would get 0.6075 BTC at itBit (I used biscoint.io for effective price comparison). Then he would send those bitcoins to you, which you would in turn sell for 63.597 rupees at coinsecure (according to Biscoint as well).
You should compare how much rupees you would get if you used paypal to transfer and convert the same 1000 usd into inr, and then decide on what is better for you at the time. The prices vary on both ends, so it might be advantageous sometimes, and not so much at other times.
