Oh it was just a joke, I don't have anywhere near that amount invested haha. It would just suck to buy at an ATH last month then watch the value plummet in a matter of weeks, while the value has still technically increased in overall percentage terms. It'd be a hard pill to swallow.

Why would you need to use it to buy directly? Just confirm your bank details/ID and use it purely as an escrow/fiat exchange platform

The mentality you have here will likely lose you money, and very quickly if the market goes through a spike/dip. Ultimately it's up to you how you do it, but I personally would never set a limit sell for when it goes BELOW a certain price, only above (if short term profit was my aim). Setting up a limit buy for BTC (but still within your dollar-cost average boundaries) should theoretically allow you to buy when the market dips, and then you'd sell when the market recovers. Obviously this involves keeping fiat or BTC on the exchange, which has its own problems, but it all depends how quickly you want to turn it around.

Coinbase haven't "robbed" you, you've either just done something wrong, or there is a backlog in which you're caught up in.

I have a latent theory that cryptocurrencies are going to be what Marx thought of as the 'Proletariat Revolution'. The signs are all there, except it's happening in a far more digitised way than could have ever been predicted in the 1800s (obviously). Just my two cents.

You need to verify your bank before you can withdraw, not before/at the same time as.

No problems at all, just make sure everything is fully verified first, and you've activated both the euro and gbp accounts. Sending from my bank account to revolut to gdax can take less than 6 hours if i get the transfer in early.

A combination of public perception and the lack of crypto-knowledge the average user has, most likely. At least in the not-too-distant future. Things might change when crypto *really* takes off, but it's still a very, very niche thing. Think about it this way, at a very, *very* optimistic estimate there are probably around 12-16 million crypto users worldwide (but this could be as low as 3 million, depending on your criteria). On a global market scale, that's nothing. Anecdotally, I've seen more people recently asking "what is Bitcoin" on FB and the like, and I know for a fact these people are just your average Joes that have seen or heard about it on the news, who might not even want to invest (or if they do it's because they think they can get rich quick). Start talking to them about Lisk or Monero or even Litecoin and they'd very quickly lose interest. Unless something catastrophic happens to Bitcoin, it will most likely always be the entry point for the average Joe. There may well be a coin that overtakes it in the future in terms of investment return, but Bitcoin was and is the brand pioneer. Much in the same way that old people will just use internet explorer (although obviously we're coming to the end of its lifespan) because it's "there already".

I want it to keep dropping this week, this is just market correction after the massive pre-thanksgiving spike. Hopefully it'll drop back down to around £6.5k, then start a new climb in time for 2018. I think we'll probably see a post-xmas drop too if people buy then quickly sell when they get worried about a few % decreases.

For anyone that isn't from the UK, the Express is defined by its unbelievably sensationalist headlines, and they *always* capitalise at least one of the words for effect. It's almost a meme over on r/ukpolitics at this stage.

Mine suck absolute dick. They just randomly turn themselves off, don't alert me if they are switched on, switch themselves off after one alert etc. It's a fucking nightmare.
