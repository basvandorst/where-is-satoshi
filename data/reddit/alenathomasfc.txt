Just come across the same article on BitsOnline website. 
Few Safety tips from it:
Typing the web address manually is not a recommended practice.
Bookmark the official websites.
Never Google for website names. 
Make sure you go to the verified address and reconfirm it twice.
Never Share Credentials on such phishing sites.
