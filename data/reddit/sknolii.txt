You're sorely misinformed.


Protoshares were a fully redeemable token for BitShares DAC sharedrops and every Protoshare holder has received their proper allocation.


It was a donation-based fundraiser and pre-sale for BitSharesX. The daily auction allowed for Bitcoin or Protoshares donations.  Not sure what the problem is.

Bitshares is currently running at 10 transactions-per-second; however, it's designed to scale without centralization to VISA-like speeds at 10,000 transactions-per-second.  They're incrementally implementing steps to achieve these speeds such as replacing Level DB with something better (currently considering FastDB) which should get close to 2,000 transactions-per-second.


Bitshares' TITAN already has a field in the account record to operate multisig in this manner.. it just hasn't been implemented into the wallet just yet.  So what you're describing is already in the works.

While I agree with your conclusion, I think your statement regarding "trillions of dollars in gold" is somewhat misleading.  The United States entire gold holding of ~8000 tons is only worth $300B.  
Since physical gold is a financial asset for central banks, it's not actually traded so IMO a more fair comparison might be BTC vs the largest gold ETF (GLD).  At its all-time highs BTC's market cap was ~$14B while the market cap of the GLD is ~$31B.  So the liquid, tradeable gold market is actually *far* smaller than you think and is not much bigger than BTC.

Thanks for the response.
Could you elaborate on how transaction times could effect the execution of market orders when using scripts like the new Ethereum functionality?  In particular I'm interested in whether or not long transaction times could potentially leave the blockchain open to undoing transactions... meaning that if it takes hours to execute an order then how could it be certain that the existing blockchain is the final, longest one.

Preston Byrne is a lawyer that strongly supports regulating Bitcoin as discussed on LTB where he argued in favor of the BitLicence.  He believes cryptos would "stand to benefit society far more in legal uses than in subversive ones" so it's no surprise that he's trying to spread FUD about BitShares.

That article points out that the daily *volume* of gold futures is $240B which does not represent "worth" of any kind.  In fact, the article also states that gold is currently trading at ~6% of all currencies which supports that its volume and price action are merely a side effect of its role as a hedge position against other currencies.

BitShares bitUSD is backed by 300% collateral. The reason bitUSD is trading at a premium is due to market liquidity.. bitUSD is created when a long and short position match; however, there's not much shorting at the moment which is driving the price higher as shorts approach margin call.
@_date: 2015-05-01 21:59:51


BitUSD isn't backed by USD; it's backed by BTS.  So if someone pays $1.07 for bitUSD that just means it cost them 305 BTS to acquire the asset instead of the average of 285 BTS.


That people don't have to buy at all.  BitUSD doesn't even spring into existence until a buyer and a seller agree on a price.. once they agree and collateral is added a contract is essentially formed called 'bitUSD'. Nothing is forcing anyone to buy unless there's a margin call.. and even then it's not covered at the premium it's covered at feed.

IMO you have this backwards; the point of the feed is to follow the bitAsset. BitAssets are essentially just loans and the feed is just an indicator to give traders an idea of where the baseline is.


It's a free market so buyers and sellers agree on the terms (price). Right now there's high demand for bitUSD so buyers are willing to pay a premium.. I don't see why that's a bad thing. Nothing is forcing the buyers of bitUSD to pay above the feed.  
With that said, the next rollout of enhancements will significantly increase liquidity and protection for everyone and make the price feed nearly irrelevant. 
@_date: 2015-05-01 20:34:27
No, the bitAsset mechanism hasn't failed and bitUSD trading at a premium isn't a bad thing... in fact, it's a *great* thing if you're holding bitUSD. 
So far I think the new rules are:
* No explicit short sell price limit
* No pre-set expiration on short positions
* bitAssets can be settled at 99% price feed
* Black swan protection
* Required collateral reduced from 300% to 200%

First, you wouldn't have to start with a value of zero.  Second, miners will mine if they find it profitable.  Third, you wouldn't *have* to rely on miners alone by simply changing the method to proof-of-stake rather than proof-of-work.
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:27:30


I disagree.  A few quick thoughts:
 
First, transactions times *do* matter.  I don't know why you'd say otherwise.  
Second, energy consumption may not matter now but will in the future as miners transfer energy consumption costs with transaction fees.  Bitcoin's POW protocol requires far more energy than POS.  And as mining rewards decrease, there will be fewer but larger miners to support the system which could be bad for security.  I suppose Bitcoin could eventually switch to POS but in doing so could upset the miners which would have a negative effect on the network.
Third, Bitcoin doesn't offer decentralized DNS like Namecoin and implementing it would be difficult.

I completely agree and have been very frustrated with users on by trying to compare the two.  IMO, people that compare Bitcoin to real gold don't understand either.
**Bitcoin != Gold**
Bitcoin is going to be a major player in the money markets and IMO will eventually replace the need for VISA, Paypal, etc; however, comparing it to a finite element is far fetched.  
Gold has *intrinsic value* and at the very least its price is supported by the energy/manpower to get it out of the ground (not to mention its scarcity and usefulness).  
Bitcoins value comes from its framework, functionality, and security but does *not* have intrinsic value.. and at the very least its price is supported by its usefulness and the energy required to mine and maintain the framework.
Cryptocurrencies are killer because they could literally replace banks, banking institutions, wire transfers, etc. and could potentially replace the stock market and morph many other markets *but* they are not gold.
IMO, the value of Bitcoin should be more closely aligned with the value of companies it could replace.  Add up the market caps of VISA, Mastercard, JPMorgan, Bank of America, etc and *that* is the potential market cap of Bitcoin.  Pricing it in gold lowers the value of Bitcoin and lowers the value of gold.. they're two completely different things with two completely different purposes.

If gold has lower intrinsic value than tungsten then why is tungsten so much cheaper than gold?  Intrinsic value has little to do with utility, rather it has to do with *scarcity* which is why rare metals such as lanthanum are as expensive as they are despite their lack of uses.

You've gotten very sensitive very quickly and I have no idea why.  All I did was call scenario bullshit.. didn't know I had to be censored here. 


If you say "all leaves are green" then I need a sample of one non-green leaf to disprove your thesis.
Intrinsic value is not subjective; it's objective.
In your scenario, gold still has more intrinsic value than water when viewed objectively.  You've shifted the argument away from "Does intrinsic value exist?" to "What is value?" unnecessarily.. by creating a subjective scenario to prove your original premise that value is "only relative, utility, or subjective value".
I was never arguing about the definition of value and honestly don't care.  I was merely supporting the idea that intrinsic value exists and is apparent in gold.


Gold does have some industrial uses; however, most of its utility comes from its use as a monetary asset.  Hah, gold's utility is not "more intrinsic" than Bitcoin but it's value comes from it being intrinsic whereas Bitcoins value comes from its utility.


I don't disagree with this.  In your example, your cat drawing has scarcity but lacks fundamentals.. which is why a one-of-a-kind Van Gogh might be considered priceless.


Bitcoins are scarce but easily synthesized using an Altoin; its value is only supported by the network effect.  Gold is scarce and not easily synthesized and its value is supported by its innate and natural scarcity.

I feel like I'm in the minority because I disagree about it going to zero.  If the technology continues to prove its secure and efficient then BTC will retain value.

It's easy to demonstrate; intrinsic value would mean that that value can never be removed.
You are in a desert. You haven't drunk anything for two days. I arrive in my helicopter with one litre of water and a gold bar. Would you prefer the gold bar, with it's "intrinsic" value or the water?
This is a wildly ridiculous statement.  You falsely established a definition of value then created a scenario to fit the argument.  In your bullshit scenario the individual isn't even choosing between the value of gold vs the value of a litre of water; the individual is choosing between the value of living vs not living.  Not only that but it's focused on a sample size of *one*-  ask the billions of people not trapped in a desert without water which they'd prefer and you'd have completely different results.


Bitcoins value comes from its utility while most of gold's value comes from its natural scarcity.  Natural scarcity creates value.. that's why rare earths such as lanthanum are expensive.  Lanthanum doesn't have much utility so shouldn't it be cheap?

True but if Paypal doesn't adopt Bitcoin it could be replaced by another escrow service.


It doesn't seem like you understand what the word intrinsic means.  Intrinsic simply means belonging naturally. Gold's natural scarcity is what makes it intrinsically valuable.  The same can be said for other rare earth elements whereby their prices are determined by their scarcity... so they're said to have intrinsic value.


I agree that there will be 'Bitcoin banks'.. I was merely referring to the need of having an abundance of brick and mortar facilities.

The nominal values of share prices merely represent a stake in the market cap.  The speculative money going into Bitcoin is following the an estimated and projected market cap value rather than it's current utility.  
Bitcoin already has volume comparable to Paypal with technology that's more advanced and efficient for microtransactions than is being used by any bank or credit card company.  This means that speculative money believes Bitcoin's potential is in the multi-billions.. and since the current market cap is only $5B there's still a lot of room for growth.
Furthermore, I'd like to point out that there's no way this is a bubble because *nobody* knows about Bitcoin.  Seriously, go out and speak with people and no one has a clue what it is... it's still such a new technology.  Hell, most people don't even know how to buy it because it's a little difficult without some know-how or research.  I see Bitcoin as an infant that will grow up to be a giant.
@_date: 2013-11-12 21:46:59


What example?  I only see an example involving more advanced technology which is an argument about cost-benefit-analysis.  I mean, gold could technically be synthesized by creating the isotope from a nuclear reactor but would it be worth the price?  Conversely, Bitcoin *can* and is easily synthesized.  Its scarcity is arbitrary and artificially manufactured rather than being innate. 


Yes, many methods exist to determine how much exists in the crust.


That's false.  Even if we're 100% proficient at finding it on Earth, it's still finite.


It's not accurate but ok.  Bitcoin can be easily cloned.. it's utility and value are derived by perception and people's willingness to use it for transactions.

I think you're misunderstanding Chinese demand.  The BTCCHina orders aren't coming from the Chinese government; they're coming from Chinese citizens for the same reasons US citizens are buying.  Just saying because it seems like folks around here have a conspiracy theory that the Chinese government is using BTC to take down the USD or something which is silly.


I think a more likely scenario would be that a cheaper, faster Altoin pops up and people simply use that instead.  If BTC succeeds then the rewards for cloning it will be very high; people will shift funds into the cryptocurrency with the lowest fees and fastest speeds.

While very likely, it's definitely not certain.  Right now there's a lot of buying because people don't want to "miss the boat" but it's still 100% speculative buying based on the idea that BTC will survive and be free of government regulation/intervention and that the average person will eventually use it as a method of payment.

Bitcoins have artificial scarcity.


While it is technically possible to synthesize gold, it would take a large particle accelerator or nuclear reactor.  The production costs drastically exceeds the benefit and/or current market price of gold.  Nuclear reactions are the only way to create the isotope.
Bitcoin, on the otherhand, *can* be easily synthesized which is why there are so many Altcoins.

An intrinsic value can determine market value but a market value can not determine an intrinsic value.


Bitcoin does not have intrinsic value for several reasons.. its scarcity is artificially and arbitrarily set, not to mention that it can be easily be synthesized as seen by the many dozens of Altcoins in existence (unlike rare element isotopes which require nuclear reactors).

Mt.Gox has been *very* slow today.  I wouldn't be surprised if the price crashes today or tomorrow.  With that said, I bought some yesterday and if the price drops significantly then I'll buy again!

I like Peter Schiff but he's ignorant about Bitcoin.  
I'm glad he's welcoming people on the show to debate him; hopefully some good debate will come out of it.  Peter is usually bearish on anything aligned with short term gains.. I think if a someone could explain the long term benefits of Bitcoin and explain the potential then he'd come around.

The US dollar isn't falling against Bitcoin; Bitcoin is rising against the dollar.  I think that's an important distinction to make.
Bitcoin will not destroy the economy.. it offers alternatives to the current system.  Tons of new businesses will be created as a result of this new technology.  If existing companies choose not to adopt it, they may go the way of Blockbuster.

You're correct about my position.  You're also correct that people use other elements for transactions.


I agree about the network effect but I disagree with others not offering superior properties.  Both Litecoin and Peercoin have advantages to Bitcoin.. and Namecoin even more benefits (which I feel is closer to being truly intrinsic).


I don't disagree with Bitcoins exceptional utility but I do disagree that it's *better* than gold.. one is not better than the other.. they're serve different purposes.


I don't foresee Bitcoin's codebase being modified so I think  is a very real scenario.  I own Bitcoins and I believe in cryptocurrencies so I'm not trying to ruffle everyones feathers.. just trying to be realistic amongst the non-stop circlejerk pump and pump and 'to the moon' BS I see all the time here.

**Bitcoin != Gold**
Bitcoin is going to be a major player in the money markets and IMO will eventually replace the need for VISA, Paypal, etc; however, comparing it to a finite element is far fetched.  
Gold has *intrinsic value* and at the very least its price is supported by the energy/manpower to get it out of the ground (not to mention its scarcity and usefulness).  
Bitcoins value comes from its framework, functionality, and security but does *not* have intrinsic value.. and at the very least its price is supported by its usefulness and the energy required to mine and maintain the framework.
Cryptocurrencies are killer because they could literally replace banks, banking institutions, wire transfers, etc. and could potentially replace the stock market and morph many other markets *but* they are not gold.
IMO, the value of Bitcoin should be more closely aligned with the value of companies it could replace.  Add up the market caps of VISA, Mastercard, JPMorgan, Bank of America, etc and *that* is the potential market cap of Bitcoin.  Pricing it in gold lowers the value of Bitcoin and lowers the value of gold.. they're two completely different things with two completely different purposes.
IMO, people that compare Bitcoin to real gold don't understand either.

Why would you want to put Bitcoin on a US dollar standard?  The two are fundamentally different.  It would make more sense to peg it to gold but even then it would be tricky based on the differences in scarcity.

They wouldn't want to replace the USD with BTC as the world reserve currency since having a decentralized currency would not be beneficial to them.
Besides, their partnership in the creation of the BRICS and large gold hoarding supports a new gold-backed Euro-type currency.  The investment demand in BTC from China is not coming from the government.. its coming from the citizens for the same reasons we're buying.

@_date: 2013-11-13 18:37:17
Yeah, that's basically how it works.  Why do you think it's insane? :]
The idea is that the set protocol enforced transaction fee (.01 Peercoin) will discourage high transaction volume in order to encourage savings and provide stability thus creating a 'backbone' currency like a savings account.  High volume micropayments could be provided by centralized providers or a less decentralized network optimized for high capacity transaction processing.
[Here]( is an interesting post that discusses this further.

I agree- Namecoin's decentralized DNS would certainly give it intrinsic value.  It would also be considered scarce though I suppose another coin could be created to form another TLD...  
@_date: 2013-11-12 19:44:38
What's there to say about it?  It's not very controversial.  Bitcoin *is* better than gold for many things but it's not gold.  Bitcoin is not a rare earth element like gold.  In the real world, rare earth elements have and retain value due to their natural scarcity.  Bitcoin has artificially created scarcity (arbitrarily set to 21,000,000 BTC) to mimic gold but it's artificial and thus not intrinsic.

If I was the Chinese government, I wouldn't give a shit Bitcoin.  If I wanted to, I could easily end BTC to RMB convertibility and shutdown any and all markets and exchanges.  I could also easily launch negative propaganda campaigns to deter investment.  But I would't do any of that because BTC wouldn't effect me in the least.
I guess I could invest in BTC with a small portion of my enormous supply of USD I've accumulated from the dumb Imperialists but for what purpose?

If an individual proof-of-stake mines then they receive interest (inflation) with their coins.  Even though the money supply increases, the "net effect" is deflationary because the fixed transaction fee doesn't go to a minor's income; it's destroyed to offset the 1% inflation caused by the POS mining.  So by design there is no overall change in the money supply.
The developers hope that if inflation increases (more people using it), then transaction costs become cheaper which increases the urge to participate in transactions.  Conversely, if deflation increases then transaction costs become more expensive which increases the urge to save more.. which in turn produces more "decentralized" inflation.


There is not inflation with Bitcoin but the associated transaction fees could steadily increase as block rewards decrease and the energy required to mine increases.  The increase in fees and lack of interest make it a less enticing option for saving when compared to Peercoin.  Not to mention that with Peercoin *anyone* can mine just by holding it whereas with Bitcoin you have to have a mining rig or be apart of a pool.. so as a user of Bitcoin you're constantly paying miners for support while with Peercoin the fees are naturally destroyed.

What if I'm buying something between the range of $1.50 and $50,000?  How long should I wait?  Businesses aren't going to accept BTC for transactions if they have to wait 10 minutes for a transaction to go through.


Regardless, the higher electricity costs will be passed down to non-miners through fees.  Furthermore, as block rewards decrease there will gradually be fewer and fewer miners which will not only have a negative effect on network security but could also reduce user selection.
A proof-of-stake system like Peercoin gets around this by establishing a set protocol enforced transaction fee (.01 Peercoin) while also giving users 1% interest.  Even though the money supply increases, the "net effect" is deflationary because the fixed transaction fee doesn't go to a minor's income; it's destroyed to offset the 1% inflation caused by the POS mining. So by design there is no overall change in the money supply and the fees are naturally stabilized and eliminated.

I think he's just ignorant about what Bitcoin actually is and the role it will play in the future.  Since he's well versed in gold, he immediately becomes defensive because people are referring to it as "gold 2.0" which is an unrealistic and inaccurate description of its use.
Also, the Bitcoin community is rather cultish and fanatical with its "to the moon" nonsense.. I suspect he's probably right that many are only in it for the money rather than the utility.

Like other rare earth isotopes, gold is priced higher than iron because of its scarcity.  The same can be said for other rare earth metals such as lanthanum, which are expensive because of their rarity not their usefulness.  
I'm not going to argue definitions as they seem accurate so I'll move on to your conclusion.


Bitcoin's scarcity is arbitrarily and artificially set rather than being determined naturally.  In addition, its scarcity could also be argued since (unlike rare isotopes) Bitcoin can be synthesized as seen by Altcoins.  It does take energy and money to mine; however, it could be argued that much of the energy is money is wasteful and unnecessary when compared to other cryptocurrencies.  
Look, I'm not trying to dog on Bitcoin.. I own it and I'm bullish on it.. but it's *not* gold.  It's not the same thing.. that's all I'm trying to say.

That's not true.  Countries around the world pegged their currencies to the US dollar decades ago with great economical success.  It wasn't until recently that the USD standard has fallen out of favor.


If investors are able to purchase Litecoin with fiat, the price of LTC will increase dramatically.  Investors will see it as a 'silver vs gold' investment opportunity.  And LTC does have its advantages.


I agree that Ripple isn't a good option.


I disagree.  Peercoin's POS protocol is very well implemented and thought out.  Sunny is incredibly intelligent and has remarkable community support.  In addition, Namecoin's decentralized DNS style system *will* happen.. whether Namecoin is the one to do it or not is yet to be seen.

Bitcoin being cloned doesn't detract from its scarcity but it does detract from its utility which is why people will use it.  Why buy a BTC for $100,000 with higher fees if another coin is cheaper, faster, and with smaller fees?  Common sense says to use the cheaper, faster coin.  In the end, the average Joe doesn't give a shit about BTC.. the average consumer will want everything BTC offers but at a cheaper price.  So unless BTC adapts to future competition it could go bye-bye.
And again, it's about cost-benefit-analysis.  Creating synthetic gold would be *extremely* costly with little benefit; however, cloning BTC has high benefit and low costs.  So which one has more risk?  Bitcoin.

It's important to note that while there *is* a 1% inflation there is also a flat 1% transaction fee which essentially nullifies the inflation.  I believe Peercoin will prove itself to be an extremely viable cryptocurrency.. just a matter of time.

I don't disagree with you.. the growth *is* coming from speculative investment.  The video simply explains that the price actions (while huge) are completely normal.  The nominal values are based on a projected market cap.. and people believe that if Twitter is worth $24B, VISA is worth $127B, and Facebook is worth $120B then the Bitcoin protocol is probably also in that range or higher.
