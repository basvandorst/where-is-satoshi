Not sure were you are getting this.  The smallest TX amount a core node will validate is 546 Satoshis, and the smallest TX amount that will be relayed by a core node in default configuration is 2730 Satoshis.

Smaller blocks = higher fees due to increased competition to get transactions recorded.
Miners want smaller blocks, users want lower fees.
@_date: 2017-03-04 21:50:02
Nodes should stop relaying blocks that are not full if there are pending transactions in the mempool.  
Also, nodes should only accept small blocks if the longest chain forces them to.  This gives priority to miners who mine full blocks and wouldn't require any soft or hard forks.
@_date: 2017-01-25 21:23:58
I'll make it more attractive to miners by giving precedence to blocks mined from pools that support SegWit.  
It's not a huge change in the source and doesn't break any protocols.
Also blocks that only contain a couple KB?  Nope.  Not going to relay those either until the longest chain forces me to.

Changing the PoW requires a hard fork, refusing to relay transactions/blocks doesn't.
@_date: 2017-01-25 18:40:02
I haven't seen hard evidence the network is being spammed this time - it looks like natural growth overtaking the network's ability to clear transactions.
@_date: 2017-01-25 05:29:45
Miners hold most of the power, and they reap bigger fees when there is pricing competition to get into blocks.
One option to redistribute that power would be a custom node implementation that refused to relay blocks if a miner doesn't mine your transactions.  You'd need to get enough peers running your implementation however.

Which doesn't help his business at all since Lightning doesn't exist in any usable form.
Also, pollution isn't a problem since Fusion will be here any day, and no need to worry about disease since protein folding will be solved soon too.

There's no way we'd see as many Bitcoin services being developed if Bitcoin was GPLed.
All the GPL does is add an adoption tax (pay GPLed code devs, or pay your non-GPLed code devs to rewrite it).
@_date: 2015-08-12 20:56:32
GPL = author plans on charging money if you need the code for commercial purposes and don't want leak your trade secrets.
Ethereum for example is GPLed, Bitcoin is not (and also uses the MIT license).
This is better.

Except they are showing more than 8 decimal places, which implies an extreme amount of sub-precision, or floats and not decimals.
@_date: 2015-08-12 22:46:05
When someone talks about Bitcoin (proper-noun) in the context of code what else would they be referring to?
No devs other than the Bitcoin-core ones matter as far as Bitcoin-the-protocol goes (which for all intents is defined by the Bitcoin-core code).
Changes to the Bitcoin-core code effectively equal changes to the protocol.
One can argue the point re-forks/consensus usage/whatever, but it is irrelevant in practice (though technically correct).
@_date: 2015-08-14 17:43:32
The problem is you won't get 0.9 from 0.9f, because there is no such thing as 0.9 when dealing with floats.
Each time rounding is applied is an opportunity for defects.  Rounding rules themselves are subject to business rules.  Fixed-point makes rounding and imprecision a non-issue. 
The following code will infinite loop:
	for (float a = 0.0f; a != 1.0f; a += 0.1f)
	{
		printf("%f
", a);
	}
It's trivially simple code, but fails in counter-intuitive ways for reasons I've articulated.
EDIT: add an example.

Computer scientist here! If you understand why .1f != .1d in C, then you have an idea why the fractional use of floating points is unsafe when dealing with financial quantities.
@_date: 2015-08-14 02:16:33
Pure profit when you need more than 53 bits of precision or have a number that isn't evenly divisible by an inverse power of 2!

All economists are correct, its just the timing that is off.
@_date: 2015-08-14 04:56:26
The challenge with numbers like +/- 0.9, is they are actually approximations when stored using IEEE754.
You probably already know this, but IEEE754 represents the fractional component as a sum of inverse binary powers.
The problem with .9, is it has inverse prime factors other than 2 (i.e. 3).  So .9 gets approximated as 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... in IEEE754.
When it's rendered, ~.9 gets rounded to ".9", but internally you perpetually lose precision.
This is why .1f (32 bit float) is not equal to .1d (64 bit float) - they are both approximations that aren't actually equal to 1/10, because it's mathematically impossible using just inverse powers of 2.
Using the fractional part of a floating point for financial calculations opens up an entire class of software defects around imprecise fractional amounts, and creates vulnerabilities around skimming fractions of cents/Satoshis/whatnot, and/or circumventing sanity checks due to logic that doesn't account for rounding / imprecision.
This is why most financial systems either use fixed point (Decimal type or integers) or floating point with a prohibition on fractional components except for final rendering (such as JavaScript where all Numbers are 64bit IEEE754).
Every computer scientist gets burned really badly by this at least once in their career, it's counter intuitive unless you really dissect the binary representation of IEEE754.

Speculation. Evidence needed. If all the main economic nodes go to 2MB block sizes, it's not like Core couldn't integrate the changes and continue on.

If you use RBF almost all of the shitty wallets out there will claim you are trying to double-spend, and you will get to explain to your angry recipients the mechanics of transaction replacement.
The term double-spend never should have been introduced into Bitcoin.  Replacement and/or cancellation are much more descriptive terms to laymen and have legitimate use-cases.
