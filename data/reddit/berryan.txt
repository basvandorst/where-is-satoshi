But this doesn't address the why we should part of my argument. It makes more sense to leverage other protocols that have already been built for specific tasks and are almost certainly more efficient at it. I'm not opposed to side chains, I am opposed the divisive nature of the space right now. There is so much more value is Bitcoin core focusing on scaling their system, securing it further, and ensuring true decentralization than there is doing the R&amp;D on projects that other people have already done; and most likely done better than they could. Leverage the existing developments as side chains and allow each group to focus on the issues already existing in their vertical.

Very much this, these are technologies before anything else.

You don't see a reason for a ubiquitous supply chain, decentralized application development, decentralized internet offerings, decentralized cloud infrastructure, or a decentralized, verifiable, and perminant voting systems? 
I find that hard to believe if you truly understand the technology.

I agree almost entirely. There are some things I don't think Bitcoin will be able to do with by adding additional layers. Instead there will be a small handful of sibling networks that aren't built on a higher layer of the Bitcoin protocol. They'll be completely separate networks that still integrate and interact with every layer of the Bitcoin protocol. Interoperability will be key for these to succeed, especially with Bitcoin, but they will still be necessary. The IOT and big data management is the big one in my mind. That will require a beast of it's own.

I personally don't care about alt coins as much as I care of a perminant ledger as a means of ensuring accountability and right now the best option is DLT. Since that means alt coins come with that then so be it. A decentralized cloud and internet are the 2 tallest orders in my list but the technical challenges to achieve them will be less daunting every year; especially as the IOT comes into play and infrastructures can be leveraged globally. Being able to hold anyone accountable for what they do online or in a network is invaluable in my eyes. This would immediately replace the need for governance in across enterpise management platforms like SharePoint and Box saving companies millions maybe billions globally. 
Decentralized internet I think speaks for itself but look at the net neutrality issues going on in the states and it makes sense why people would want it. Takes control out of the hands of the 3 massive providers who monopolize the market. Not to mention it would be a great step towards stopping censorship in places like China and North Korea.
I will say I think decentralized application development platforms has the least need of any in my list. I can see use cases for businesses in the future but these use cases most likely won't have a ton of value until we have decentralized networks in every day life. The payment channels would need to be in place first.
A perminant and verifiable voting system could leverage DLT to eliminate nearly all voter fraud. Identity verification would be the most difficult part of this but there are already DLT projects doing it. 
Supply chain is the most obvious use case in my eyes. If you spent 5 minutes overseeing the manufacturing supply chain of a car, for example, you would completely understand. 20 companies all making a different part(s) of one car, all using their own independent means of tracking the supply chain. This is immediately remedied using DLT that is ubiquitous across all companies involved. This is a multi billion dollar project if done correctly.

You're putting words in my mouth. You don't need hundreds, just as many is necessary for a system with optimized efficiency.
It's hard to see past the dollar (or Bitcoin) signs sometimes but these are technologies first and foremost before they are currencies. That is ultimately what will drive adoption, not the other way around.

Just because it could doesn't mean it should. Bogging down one protocol by forcing it to carry the weight of an entire infrastructure doesn't make sense when you can have an infrastructure built out of multiple protocols communicating and carrying the weight of different tasks. That's how IT works today and unless we make massive strides is hardware development I don't see that changing any time soon.
Using a group project anology: Why make u/lurker1325 do the entire group project themself? While they are the most popular and hardest working in the group, I'm capable of helping and better at certain parts of the work that needs to be done. I could kick my feet up but it's more efficient if I get my hands dirty too.

She ended up asking me how much she should buy and my response was this, almost verbatim. "No more than you are willing to lose, because there is always the chance you can lose it all."

They do not - the Ethereum network for example can generate an infinite number of ether.

Luckily I'll be the one managing her private key so this shouldn't be an issue. She trusts me enough to know I'm not going to steal from her. She will have a copy of course, but I made sure to tell her its smart to leave me a copy for this reason or in the instance she loses her private key.

Luckily she trusts me to manage everything for her. She will be a hodler whether she likes it or not since I'll be the one holding her private key at first.
She just isn't tech savvy enough to know how to secure it. Now that she is invested I'm going to work on teaching her how to secure her coins and use her own wallet.

My dad is better off financially and I've told him I want him to take exactly 25% of my inheritance  and invest it in crypto.
I have yet to crack this nut. He's an old stocks guy so before he will even touch the stuff he wants a carnal knowledge of the market and tech.

I'll have to make sure to not mention this to my siblings... ;)

Hoarding doesn't necessarily mean they sit on their bitcoins and never spend them... Maybe its just me but I make purchases in bitcoin and then simply go to an exchange immediately after and buy whatever quantity in bitcoin I just spent at the same evaluation. 
It furthers the bitcoin economy but I don't lose any ground minus a few dollars in transactions fees which I see as worth the investment.

Actually Rice University and Louisiana State have research indicating it was severe droughts caused by climate change in the region that caused the Mayans all to die off so quickly.
Something to do with certain element levels in the sediment of Belize's Big Blue Hole. Way less badass than your theory, sadly.

My argument is that I don't have the reputation to make gross statements. Therefore I'm pointing you to someone, with the reputation, who has made the argument for me.

No way of knowing for sure but I agree with this. Growing distrust for the government and the USD coupled with a few recessions is what it will take. 
People who were  hit extremely hard in 2008 (the average Joe, not experts) are becoming much more savvy with their money and assets. I think this will continue happening with each concurrent recession in the future. Couple this with the fact that cryptocurrencies seem to be getting more stable over time leads to my prediction that with each recession you'll see more and more people over time gradually moving towards cryptocurrencies.

Maybe not directly related but indirectly? Absolutely. My point is that since this is a forum built on reputation, you really have no choice if you want information from a credible source. Especially in this sub where r/BTC trolls seem to be common.


A simple search will tell you everything you need to know about this persons reputation specific to whatever sub you're on. You just did it to me.


Since when did citing credible sources to substantiate claims start weakening arguments?
At the end of the day all roads lead back to the reputation of the person making the post. Me making this post alone will only go so far. Proving there is a logical basis to back up my claims, that is also shared among other people with much more experience, and it goes a lot further.

Avoid the middle and ends of the month. Typically this is when people get paid and usually you'll see an increase in purchasing around those times which drives the price up.
