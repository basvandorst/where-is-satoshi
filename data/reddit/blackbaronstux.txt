That's horrible advice. For all you know, Bitcoin might not ever be this low again. If it breaks 1k easily, 1k could become the new support level. The best time to buy is now.

Yeah, it's just a giant coincidence this rally is reaching new ATH's in years to coincide PERFECTLY with the halving, right? Please. China has had capital flight throughout the last few years, it's never caused this much of a rally.

This is why I keep telling people that the model that altcoin is using where all of this heavy lifting is happening directly on their main chain is an extreme security risk. The beauty of Bitcoin is the fact that it is a SIMPLE (relatively speaking) underlying engine, and things can be layered on top of it. There's a term for this in software development, it is called SoC (Seperation of Concern). If a smart contract has a gaping hole, the whole of their system goes down with the ship. With Bitcoin, if there is an exploit in the smart contracts provided by a layer service (let's say RootStock for example) it does not affect the Bitcoin blockchain the slightest. The altcoin lacks this level of robustness.
TLDR: Separate your concerns, bitches.

It won't be Xapo, it will be Plutus. Plutus allows people to pay using Bitcoin at any NFC-enabled POS terminal (PayWave it's called here) only using your mobile phone.  if you're interested, they've got a demo video on their site.

Pretty obvious statement to be honest, of course millennial's will prefer Bitcoin over Gold. It does not take a genius to figure this out, and the fact that bitcoin.com is calling it an "odd statement" just goes to show how garbage that website is.

Honestly, with the run up we've seen so far I don't think $600 will be a challenge at all. Perhaps a bit of consolidation, but I really do not see it taking weeks or months. A few days at most, and that's only if it struggles to break it.

Bitcoin is divisible. This question is silly. Honestly though, I will never sell *all* of my Bitcoins. Maybe half, at most, if/when it hits a really good price, and that would only be to buy property or something, not to hold fiat. I've been holding since it was only a couple of dollars. I truly believe that Bitcoin is the millennial gold, and if I'm right about this, it isn't going anywhere and its value is only going to increase as time goes on. Better off holding Bitcoin than Fiat in that case.

It makes more sense to call it simple than dumb. Anyway, simple networks are also far more secure. Less moving parts, less things to go wrong. Ethereum will end up being a security disaster, I can feel it. Simple networks allow for a [seperation of concerns]( like RootStock for example. Thus, if any unforeseen security problems happen with smart contracts in general, it will not affect the main Bitcoin blockchain because RootStock is only a pegged side chain. This is actually one of the main reasons why I believe RootStock is going to steal Ethereum's thunder, provided it is well made with good development tools, and all things we've heard so far seem to point in that direction.

There could be a thousand reasons for this, it is an extremely poor metric and should not be taken seriously.

It's always this incredibly dumb bravenewcoin website too. They thrive off click-bait fear garbage. It's a pity they're bringing that cancerous media model to Bitcoin, but then again they're a nobody brand so whatever.

The halving is the biggest catalyst for the price rise, but all of the economic happenings in the world are also contributing as well.

Because the people who run electricity companies are not the sort of people who would have the technical expertise to run a large Bitcoin mining operation. It is very far from their area of expertise. Simply put, it's probably never occurred to them, and they wouldn't know where to begin.

Sad to hear. Hopefully the AU govt gets their act in order sooner rather than later.

No, I'm saying that the difficulty drop compensates the costs of mining Bitcoin because the coins are now cheaper to mine, and thus the current market value is now profitable. The market price per coin does not change, what changes is how expensive it is to mine a coin.

How does double taxation affect Bitcoin companies (such as Living Room of Satoshi) operating in Australia? Does it only affect the users of the service, or does it affect the business too? 
@_date: 2016-05-31 09:55:30


Sure there is. That natural dynamic is the decreased cost of mining if the difficulty drops. Regardless, it sounds like you're saying the same thing with different words.

Is Stokvel another word for pyramid scheme?

Yeah, I'm sure no one will resist fees climbing to $100. We'll all just sit back and watch it happen, then as soon as it hits $100 we'll be like "oh wait, fees!" ^^^/s
@_date: 2016-05-31 12:40:26
That quote is correct, the market price of a coin will increase if the difficulty *increases*. If it does not, miners would not be profitable and they would stop mining, and therefore the difficulty would drop. You're not correctly reading what I wrote.

Beauty is subjective. A gold coloured rock probably wouldn't be beautiful to you if you weren't conditioned to think so. It costs money to mine Bitcoin and it costs money to mine gold. That's one part of why they both hold value. The other reason is because people decided they hold value. That's all there is to it.

1% is almost certain to happen, that's nothing, and Bitcoin has far more uses than Gold does so it is not limited to only that market. $3,500 a coin will be easy soon enough.

Users are not going to create the software and distribute it themselves, unless you're willing to wait years. Leadership is required.
