Is this real money?

Woah what just happened here!?

Thanks for the info, I've registered on coinbase.com but will probably hold onto the tip I received.  Might even buy some bitcoin as I research more about it, the whole topic sounds fascinating.

Looks a little technical for me, I'm just a gamer not a computer wizz.  It looks like Khan Academy has a bunch of videos on Youtube, I've put them on my to do list for tomorrow.

Thanks, I did register on coinbase.com but I think I'm going to keep my coin.  Seems the general sentiment here is that it'll be worth a lot more one day, so we'll see what happens.  As I research I may buy some for myself to play around with, the whole thing sounds really cool right now.  I'm downloading Armory as I see that's recommended on bitcoin.org.  My goal for tomorrow is to print a paper wallet and transfer the coins to it :-)

If nobody controls it, how does it exist?  Who made it, who controls who has how much money, etc...
Edit: Read a bit more about it, I see it's a p2p network, very cool!

Thanks, I'll probably hold on to it for a rainy day.  I don't think I want to go through the hassle of linking my bank account for $10.  But from the sounds of it, this $10 may be worth a reasonable amount worth linking for in the future!

Well for starters what can I buy with it? :-)

Wow those are some impressive numbers, how can bitcoin be so big and I am just hearing about it!  I wish I could have gotten $10 worth a few years ago haha.

Is this real money?  Or just buttcoin fantasy?
