Uhh the same can be said for just about anything. Assets are only worth what someone else is willing to pay. This applies TO EVERYTHING idiot.

This is the part where all the people who havent made any money come out to tell you how they were so smart and knew this would happen. Problem is I still made boatloads of money and they didn’t. Jokes STILL on them hahaha

Why is CNBC so quick to update their headlines when the price is falling but won't post absolutely nothing about the rebound?

You are really trying to portray intelligence by patronizing others - "bingo, smart dog". 
You and the market seem to disagree on what worthless means. You also seem rather hostile which leads me to believe you haven't enjoyed any of the recent wealth generated in this space and are angered by it now. I understand your anger and have compassion for you.

Peter is in the business of selling Gold. Everyone talks about how he predicted the 2008 crash. What they don’t mention is that he has been calling for a crash year after year his entire career. Broken clock is right twice a day. He does this because it fits his agenda of selling Gold. Bitcoin is a threat to his business and he knows it.

Your first sentence is correct. Your third sentence is incorrect.
Your fourth sentence is most likely incorrect.

The Youtube description clearly states that this was streamed today through CNBC. In the future, it's best to look at the information presented in regards to the video posting.

What is the point of any of this? Think about it for a second. Everyone is worrying about the marketable value of a bunch of 1s and 0s on a computer.

What? Where? The S&amp;p500 is near ATH and international indexes seem to make new ATH on a regular basis.

Most people are dumb and can't accumulate wealth or at least save enough to retire. Government doesn't want a bunch of broke elderly people that they have to support. 401k's are at least a forced savings plan. I wouldn't go as far as calling it a scam.

If you weren't aware, why would you say "he never says that" as if you were aware?
