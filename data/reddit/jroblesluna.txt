After separating the Alpha channel, don't use the original picture as background, but just a white bg. Then, you'll get just 1 (black) and 0 (white)... This bit stream ends on byte 2800
These are the first bits: 01010101 00110010 01000110 01110011 01100100 01000111 01010110 01101011...
Convert each 8 bits to byte and you'll get the Base64.
Decode it into a binary file (example: challenge.enc) and you'll get an encrypted OpenSSL salted format data, which you can decrypt by using this command line:
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in challenge.enc
The problem at this point is we need to know the encryption algorithm and the key (password). You can iterate among all the ciphers (someone here helped with script) or just try aes-256-cbc which is almost a default one, the real problem is the password, which seems "Lustre" managed to solve...
About Voronoi Diagram, supposedly it can hide messages into adjacent points, but there are some places where black cells almost get combined and are not so clear to be considered as separated cells... So I'm stucked here...

Hey Pip... What about distributing part of the prize to people here who already made some progress, share concepts or is demonstrating that are working on solving it?
I mean... that type of incentive could help some of us to make changes of time assignment... some have to use our time with kids and jobs but have also the knowledge and desire to solve the puzzle, but also need to fulfill family requests... then, for example with only a fraction of the prize, I guess some serious participants can forget for a while their current economic activities  and dedicate 24x7 (less sleeping time) to solve and someone for sure will get prize sooner... At least I'd dedicate the full time, just an idea... of course, rules are yours :)

Could you kindly share at least a hint on how to get the Ok ay hash? Didn't manage that yet... I've found after iluminating and embossing the image that there is kind of a 128x128 px matrix but I guess it's just the residual of some filter applied to get the artistic chalk effect...

Bitcoin mixers are actually a must to know technology. I personally suggest this one:
as it’s fast and secure (SSL) with digital contracts you can check with public key validators
