Don't mention the war!

Hilarious ��

It’s over 4,000 ��

At the table of brotherhood ;-)

You’re right. Lambos don’t make any sense. Porsche does. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:05:44
This doesn’t make any sense...

24th January

Looks more like a Bart market...
@_date: 2019-01-10 13:35:03
You’re right. They postponed it - again...
@_date: 2018-11-28 17:39:41
I totally agree on that Porsche, followed by an Audi and a Mercedes :-)

I‘m just losing gains but it still pisses me off tbh. I‘ve already cashed out way more than I initially invested. Should have sold a bit in Dec/Jan...

It’s over 8,000!��
@_date: 2018-07-17 15:55:24
Just happened - for a few seconds��

This "shit coin" proved to be a very good investment - even in times like this.

Can’t see the moon...
@_date: 2018-07-30 19:53:55
What makes you think so?
@_date: 2018-04-23 10:06:39
I am the first one :-) 
Looks like btc is taking a deep breath before the next attempt to break through 9k...
@_date: 2018-07-24 07:12:11
They will follow later as soon as Btc takes a rest...

Ay caramba!

Don’t feed the troll. He’s hasn’t invested 30k. Just somebody with too much freezing at hand...
@_date: 2019-05-12 18:26:06
It’s over 7,000��
