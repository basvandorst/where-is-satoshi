OK, but the spent balance would've been worth even MORE hosting had you saved it for those 2 weeks. Sounds like a loss there. I agree that any bitcoin purchase is beneficial and not technically a loss. Just a loss of gains and potential opportunity when sold.

That was my thought too. That would make sense.

Bitcoin has developers and is constantly being worked on. The network will have to agree as a majority to take on new benefital updates and bug fixes when moving forward. Plenty of reading out there about this.

True. I guess I'm just holding on to those gold little buggers too hard.

Thank you for this post. I finally got around to setting up 2FA and cold storage for the 95% of the rest with truecrypt and a VERY long password.

Is it bad that I'm afraid to spend with it because it goes up in value so much and I'm afraid of losing out on that profit? As much as I want to promote actual use of it for the health of the economy, I tend not to.
edit: just realizing this is discussed below. carry on.

Your timing is fine, so long as adoption continues and more business continue to grow around bitcoin, you're still in WAY before the masses and you'll make a healthy profit on anything you put in. It's only going up long term, so just stay strong and have faith in the system and you'll be good.

There's also a senate hearing this month that might have some impact one way or another for the US market. People might sell if they fear too much regulation will hurt infrastructure.

the value by fiat is an interesting thought. I've never thought about it till now but I don't have to think about comparing fiat to gold or something else for it to have intrinsic value. A dollar is a dollar or a yen is a yen and I think something is too expensive or cheap by comparing similar items priced in that same currency.

Our new slogan. This could work guys.
