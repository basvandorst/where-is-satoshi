When you trade oil futures do you get paid in oil? What about wheat? Robinhood is not an anti-government corporation. They don't give a fuck about Bitcoin, other than you can make USD off of it. Thats the end of it. Being butthurt that it's not you're perfect mobile crypto trading platform is stupid.

Can you theorize how much of this is for fiat money laundering transactions? Is btc even good for that to be a concern?

Autocorrect asshole. Just gotta make yourself feel better though because there's probably not much more going on in your life. Since we're on it, you dropped this 'T'.
It wouldn't be able to sell your data without disclosing it. Which it's disclosed in the privacy policy that you agree to when you sign up. And honestly, if you think that Robinhood is bad for selling your data, then don't use Gmail, or Chrome, or any other free service because they all do it too.
And the app itself? Genius. Makes investing more accessible to the layman. Introduces something new to many people, and then sells that data to people who will pay for it. Unethical? Sure but its a smart concept.

The demand is artificial, but it's at 25k.
 If noone wants to buy Bitcoin, why is the price going up? Price is a constant battle between buyers and sellers. If you are selling your house and nobody is making offers, youre gonna increase your price? For who?

Read up on this. This is your money you are playing with, literally. You don't want to store it in the exchange, because then you don't have control over them and the exchange can be hacked and your coins stored there stolen. Look into a hardware wallet. Read up on anything you don't understand.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:51:39
You have a code written down physically on a piece of paper when you install a wallet on your computer or phone, not too experienced with hardware wallets but I assume it works the same way. If your device fails, you can restore it by inputting that code. The code is usually like 16 random words in a certain order, very easy to just write down.

2008 happened because of not enough regulation and no fear of failing, how is that relevant to Bitcoin?

You are thinking with the knowledge of how money works for people, and not a government entity. Money is used differently when you are a government that can print it's own money. It's an entirely different way of thinking about debt.

How is the government stealing your money?
@_date: 2019-04-20 14:46:47
If you think that then you don't entirely understand the situation and need to do some research.

You do get the assets. You use the infrastructure. You drive on roads, have power, access to ems, etc

Steam will never compete with these sites. They are selling virtual items for real actual money. If you sell an item on steam, you can't take that money out of steam unless you go through one of these sites. This way they can say their items have no official value and thus people can get away with gambling these items.

Funny thing, the entirety of the DoD is considered to be unauditable. As in, public accounting firms have declined to audit the DoD because it is such a clusterfuck of accounting.

You keep repeating it but this is such a dumb argument. It's not mandatory to have 23% be used for military. "Shall fund the military" is so fucking ambiguous it's useless to use as a guide. Use a dollar for military purposes, there it's satisfied.

You don't have that debt then just like you don't have those assets
@_date: 2019-04-20 16:26:26
Alrighty, here we go. The utility poles that are put up are subsidized by the government, as are the actual power plants themselves.
 When you picked up your cell phone (which was shipped in US patrolled waters) to call 911 (which itself is maintained and developed by the government), you used communications infrastructure such as 1. GPS (not even going to go into how much government infrastructure is involved with putting shit into space and keeping it there, GPS is literally a gift free for the world to use) 2. Cellular network ( which again is subsidized federally). I can go on and on and on within any one of these topics.
To think that you pay 100% for the things you use every day is insane. The gas you put in your car is subsidized. The food you eat is subsidized. Everything involves using US owned assets.
@_date: 2019-04-20 19:15:56
That's not my logic. My logic is these things we use every day and not think about are there solely because the government built the underlying infrastructure.

Exchanges can be hacked. An exhange called Mt. Gox was hacked before and everyone who had coins stored on the exchange had them stolen. When they are on your wallet you control them.

Can you explain how this would work for miners when blocks stop giving Bitcoin? I thought miner's incentive once btc stops coming from block rewards, would be transaction fees. If transactions are so low, where's the incentive to mine?
@_date: 2015-09-11 06:05:14
Power, is this even a question? 
@_date: 2018-04-10 13:39:24
More profitable in the form of higher net work fees as well right? Less miners = less transaction speed = higher fees, am I correct in assuming that? Sorry.

I don't think you understand the EDM scene. Many artists are very open to anything really and aren't like the big guys like Eminem, being tied to a label and all, and if this turns out to be successful for Knife Party, then MANY other artists will follow suit. All you need is a few big artists and the whole EDM scene will have bitcoin. Then it's just getting the big players to accept it. 
@_date: 2013-10-25 06:01:40
This will crash and burn, hard. I don't know why they wouldn't just continue doing bitcoin business. They got too greedy, and I can't wait until it bites them in the ass.

@_date: 2017-09-14 14:33:07
Thats about as simple as I can get. Mycelium/Electrum are Android wallets that store bitcoin on your phone. When you install them, you write down a backup code on a piece of paper/on your computer in case anything happens to your phone. Sign up on one of the exchanges (coinbase, Gemini), then buy BTC. On the exchange web interface, you can send the bitcoins to any wallet. Send it to the address of the wallet you just installed. Bam. You have bought BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:19:36
I would love to believe you so bad. But it just seems too good to be true, there just had to be a catch somewhere. I'd love to invest but I just can't take the risk. I have a strange gut feeling that it will fall and crash hard, but I really just want to believe that this will be a success. I can imagine in 10 years when BTC is worth like 4k,ill be shooting myself in the head.
