Used Renault Zoe for me. I don't think I'll ever have enough bitcoin to get a Tesla even with a massive jump.

You can do both

Does the withdraw fee apply to this?
@_date: 2014-02-17 15:02:20
Nope! Same protections here in the UK with my Visa debit as a credit card. I'm sure the same applies in US. Dave Ramsey always mentions this on his show.
@_date: 2014-01-02 08:10:48
Yes. It is easyco.in

I guess they could hold onto your deposit until the movie is released to the public.

I'd worry about the laptop either dying or getting seized. Unlikely I know but I would have thought encrypted paper wallets would be a safer option. I've experimented with bitaddress.org before and it seemed to work fine.
Saying that I do currently have all my Bitcoins in an online wallet but it's only about 0.5 btc at the moment. With the amounts we are talking about here I would be very paranoid when it comes to security.

You don't need a card to use a coinkite terminal. It has the ability to print a QR code to pay the bill to. The cards just remove this step.

Used it plenty of times here in the UK. No problems with selling or buying so far.

Plenty of ATMs popping around the world. Plus Coinkite terminals that allow a business to sell/buy Bitcoins with their customers. Also have the Easyco.in service by Neo&amp;Bee coming to the UK. Things will get easier.

He is the guy that runs Coinkite

You can generate a paper wallet offline. If you want to be extra sure it is safe then do it from a bootable Linux cd.

When will the cards become available to order?
@_date: 2013-12-02 07:30:35
Localbitcoins isn't just for person to person. Here in the UK you can buy online via bank transfer. Not sure if it's an option for your country.

Have you guys thought of offering insurance against loss on an account? I would expect this to come at a cost.

Oh ok shame. I'd be rather nervous putting any substantial money into web wallets at the moment.
Inputs.io springs to mind, although I wasn't personally affected by it.
How about some more security features such as:
-Lock all withdrawals from an account with a cooling off period. Ideal for savings.
-Lock withdrawals to a certain address.
Just thinking of worst case if someone gains remote access your machine or put a key logger on it. At least you could limit what they could do.

It was pulled from the App Store. Doesn't mean you can't use it if you managed to download it.
@_date: 2013-12-13 07:44:52
Withdraw is free if you are using one of these cards
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:19:04
If Apple choose not to ban it
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:17:20
Yeah I'm just an end user. I've got a coinkite account. Just looking forward to the novelty of having the bitcoin equivalent of a debit card in my wallet.
Nice to have something tangible you can  show people.
Question still stands though
@_date: 2013-12-13 11:44:08
Yes but the card is a one off purchase if you are using a free account.

A bit far from home for me. Wish there was a meetup in the Gloucestershire area.
