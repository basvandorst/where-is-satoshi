Rough. Do you reinstall and have everything saved or are you constantly punching numbers in?

Hahaha. You say what you want, but I'm not making anyone do anything. If my info isn't appealing to you, then look away 
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:03:52
Not a scam, just a guy giving personal financial advice. Again I DON'T WANT ANYONE'S MONEY OR REFERRAL BONUS! If you like the advice I give you and want to help me out, let me know besides that just take the info I give you and do your research 
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:38:51
Then simply don't invest in the platform. If you believe it's a scam then don't invest. I do make 2% off this investment, but my other holdings in Bitcoin are In other alt coins that have risen in price since I started investing. (A percentage I'm having trouble calculate at this time.) And 2% in the crypto world is a lot of money especially with Bitcoin value right now. You seem to be very uninformed in the crypto world and again I suggest you do further research. If you aren't making money with bitcoin you are doing it wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:58:39
Trying to help people? I'm only giving info and personal advice. I'm in no way a financial advisor and only invest money that you can lose. If non of the info I give gas any interest to you please just move on. I'm just trying to help people.
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:05:33
I don't feel 100% comfortable telling you how to invest but I can tell you what I would do personally. Of i had 1k to spend on Bitcoin, I would spend half on it now and hold the other half until after the fork to see if the prices dips, which I predict it will. That way you split your investment and don't lost to much if the prices goes up instead.
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:37:39
Not either of those things. And let's do the math together. If we were going to use the example of Bitconnect where the payouts are anywhere between 0.01%~2% everyday because I couldn't give you an accurate percentage on payout daily to weekly. (So I apologize for changing the number because it's a variable number each day and week.) I can tell you it was roughly 2% for the entire month. 2k increased to 2,630 in 30 days. So in 90 days with the amount I've been earning now I've earned 1800 dollars which almost doubles my initial investment and that doesn't even take into account the compounded interest you can reinvest! Like you said youve purchased in Jan 17 and are seeing that price appreciate over the year but did you know it was going to get this high? Are you the lost X-Men and can read the future? I know I'll double my money while you'll have to watch the market. Also a 2k investment in bitcoin now wouldn't appreciate as much as buying an entire bitcoin and watching it appreciate it. Not everyone has the money to buy an entire btc and watch it appreciate like you did at the beginning of the year. People like us who are getting into the game over the last few months and only have 1k~5k to play with want to see nice returns and trusting bitcoin which costs as much as it does now to appreciate the way it has over the year is asking a lot of Bitcoin when it's already come this far 
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:54:52
I would just like to clarify a little. Not a scammer or anything of the sort. Just a guy who is earning money and wants to help others earn too. The info I'm providing to people is purely informative with some info on personal investments I've made. I'm not asking for money, I'm asking for people's time to learn more about Bitcoin and a lot coins.
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:57:19
This is really eating at you isn't it. Dont worry ill sleep great knowing ill be making more money tomorrow. XD I'm getting my btc back every single day...ill have it all back in less then 100 days as I showed you before. And the money is real, not fake, and your 4 month old article there pretty much sums up every and all start up businesses who need investors to support their product or platform.  
 
Also I this post has been deleted. As it won't give me an option yo delete it any further. Rofl.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:23:10
This month I got 2% interest off my 2k investment in Bitconnect. YouTube has some great content in Bitconnect as well and how people are earning money with the platform. Also if you have any other questions shoot me a message and we can email.
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:27:50
Only offering personal advice on investments nothing more. I'm not a financial advisor and only invest money you can lose.
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:01:52
Between Bitconnect and my Crypto holdings I'm getting 2% monthly. This isn't a joke and I don't want anyone's money. I have my own money thank you. As referrals are nice they are definitely not needed to double your investment. You should really do your research on the subject before you call it a scam.
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:58:27
When did I ever say I was trading? Now you are mistaking two different investment strategies. Of course if you are in day trading or trading your going to make more money! Duh?!?! That's what trading is all about, but if your like me you want your investments to be held and make you interest off of it. The difference between my investment and yours is that the money I put in I will get back a 1~2% interest every day that I can put in my pocket. You have to hold your money and watch the market go up and down and hopefully cash out when the value is high enough. My daily interest in guaranteed while yours is not. If you knew anything about the fork, you would understand that prices will rise before they fall after the fork. And that ~40% gain will tank while I'll still be earning my daily interest. I will double my money in 145 days. You'll double yours in maybe a year. Rofl.
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:59:40
I would cash out after the fork that way you still get Segwit2x coins to sell for more money. Last time I check Coinmarketcap.com it looked like they were predicting a pretty high value in the new coin.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:14:55
Having trouble sending the message. Can you send me a message with your email and I'll send the info to you.
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:11:26
I've been lurking for a few years. I also see this resistance but the more people who come out and legitimize it the less taboo it will become. And I didn't just make money off of Bitconnect but also other alt coins that I've invested into. All I'm offering is information on my personal investments and the success I've gotten from them. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:04:54
Purchasing now isn't a bad idea but with everyone dumping their alt coins into Bitcoin for the upcoming fork on Nov. 16 im predicting a nice drop In  price after that while everyone sells off their bitcoin into other coins.
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:19:01
Going to delete this post due to the resistance in the community towards this. I was only trying to help and offer personal advice on my own investments that have made me money. If you'd like to know more about Bitcoin and my personal investments please send me a message and I can send over information for you to simply review!
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:40:17
No your offering a different investment strategy that I don't agree with. If you want to throw your money into a lottery and hope it just keeps appreciating that's fine by me, but I like to take lesser risk and when I can get a ROI under 100 days I'm making sure I don't lose my money.
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:47:55
Haha does it now?
 
I just think you know I'm right. ;) My investment strategy isn't wrong and yours isn't either, but don't discredit mine when you don't know anything about it.
 
Also I don't need hers when I can just borrow your mom's every night. :P
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:07:47
Like the other person said, it's hard to say where the price is going to go but my personal advice if you have the mo ney to spend is spend half now and half after the fork to diversify the investment.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:09:52
Well its really up to you. If it was me and I had 1k for example to spend I would put 500 in now and then wait until after the fork and put another 500 in. That way you are totally dependent on the market. I out together a message that I'll send you that should hopefully help you out more.
