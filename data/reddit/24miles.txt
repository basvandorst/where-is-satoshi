I’m very sorry for the people that got caught up in the Ledger updates. I had to update my wallet before I could check my balance and when I did get in there was no balance. Just an observation.

Yes. I went straight to the computer and set up my new Nano X to restore a wallet. Came up zero.

I only bought the Trezor to test my seed key on a different device. It didn’t find my BTC but the Trezor didn’t generate the key and may not have been compatible. I don’t think I will ever trust another wallet again.

No one is blaming the Trezor

I sent it straight to my Coinbase BTC wallet.

I follow Antonopoulos. It wouldn’t have helped me here. I opened my Ledger, and opened my BTC wallet and it showed a zero balance. I swept the device and restored using the seed keys. Still a zero balance. I tried other wallets with my seed keys and consulted professionals. I don’t know why the Coinomi Wallet worked. I just couldn’t give up until I was sure I had exhausted every chance.

It was a substantial amount. I was so relieved all I could do is cry at first!

I went online and downloaded the wallet. It required a four number pin to set it up as well as my email address. I opted out of a password. Then I went into settings and chose the restore option. I entered the words and tapped on “next”, and there it was! I am flabbergasted that those same seed words didn’t work on the Ledger S or X, not the Trezor (I bought one to try that route), nor any online wallets. I read online that if you want a transaction to go through faster you can opt to pay higher miner fees. If you don’t then your transaction can be put in a waiting mode and if it’s left there too long it can get lost. I’m no techy but I figure it was hung up in the blockchain somewhere and it took just the right twist to turn it loose?

I’m not blaming the device either. I don’t know what happened. If you read all the comments you would see the the seed keys didn’t work anywhere I tried. I did suggest that the unit updated before I could get in to access my coins but I don’t know what caused the glitch. I even suggested that the transactions sat too long on the blockchain without being mined for a period and could have gotten lost somehow. This is NO JOKE my friend. If you read carefully you will know that I hired a company to find my coins and they couldn’t find them. They tried the same seed keys I retrieved my coins with on Coinomi. Don’t be too quick to criticize. I also had help from a man in Australia who has a degree in computer science. I suffered and agonized because I knew I did everything right. The specialist in Australia told me that he found my coins on the blockchain and they had not moved. My friend worked with me and dictated the words to me exactly on Bitcoin online wallet. The balance showed up zero. Just because you don’t believe something doesn’t make it false.

Thank you!

I used my original 24 word seed key that the Nano S generates when I set it up.

I do t know if I detached my BTC from that phrase by moving the coins to Coinbase. It’s on my BTC wallet there. Would that void the seed key? If I move the BTC off of the exchange to a wallet I set up as new and it generates a new seed key then that would detach the coins from the old ones as well? At least they are not on the blockchain anymore.

I don’t know what a derivation path is
