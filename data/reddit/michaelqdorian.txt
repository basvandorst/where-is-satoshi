Good! Never trust anyone. Chrome extensions are essentially ZIP files.
Download them (without running). Change extension from CRX to ZIP and you'll see the source code inside. And if you use our graphics, please send a coin ;)

Weird. What version of Chrome are you using? You can quickly check by going to chrome://chrome/ or Settings-&gt;About. Mine's 32

We also have some guys investigating MtGox and they are using it right now.

Normally you would be right but I needed our story to be shared. Of course, as many here have asked I will never publish the full name of our prof.
And as for school policy, much less disputes are being resolved publicly online including publicly naming the involved parties.
