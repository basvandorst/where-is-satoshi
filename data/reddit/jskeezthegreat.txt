Best analogy is comparing an open channel to your real life wallet... you can keep $20 Or $100 in your wallet... you don't worry about taking it out every night when you sleep (closing a channel).. you just leave it In there... and when you're ready to make a purchase it's available...

Lmao Mr. HODL ... 
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:55:08
I understand that a hard fork is required... I just dont understand why its contentious as this point.. it's would provide some short term relief to the network and buy core extra time.... it wouldn't be the first hard fork... like why couldn't we have the block size increase .. while we wait for segwit/ LN implementation...disclaimer: I'm a core supporter, and longtime hodler... just wonder sometimes..
@_date: 2019-07-24 01:01:41
You buy skittles every week too?
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:56:41
I'd get that explanation if we've never hardforked before.  However,  From my understanding the, I thought the Bitcoin we all identify as Bitcoin has hardforked in the past though (or so I've heard).. I wasn't here in 2009 .. I guess I could easily research the previous BIPs... but the previous hard fork had super majority 95% support so it didn't result in a chain split... seems at this point the only ransom it wouldn't get support is outta stubbornness.. or again not wanting to set a precedent on block size increasing...

I'm a transportation engineer and I try to use this analogy often... while b cash is similar to adding lanes (which does work temporarily)... bitcoin is looking to find "multi modal" solutions... ie. Transit systems, pedestrian and bike facilities,  rail... basically solutions that take vehicles away from the road,  but still able to transport people from place to place... because making the freeways larger and larger is not sustainable.....
@_date: 2018-09-05 22:20:20
I wouldn't describe it as a simple bug fix but yea..  That's a feature of decentralization..   Protocol can't simply be changed because a few people think it should... that's just how long it took to get consensus... some things will changes will gain consensus quicker than others..

@_date: 2018-09-17 23:00:41
I followed this tutorial... it was pretty straight forward.. 
I noticed my harddrive was large enough at the time ( I've since got some additional disk space)... so i had to slightly deviate from the tutorial and added a line of code to the bitcoin core configuration file.. but everything seems to be up and running... i just can't tell if i'm automatically syncing to the blockchain..
@_date: 2018-09-17 23:53:38
Yea .. what's your node ID? I'll check when i get home... 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:49:51
And that's the only answer I ever hear... but not quite the answer to my question... i get the discussion has been going on for awhile... I get its enough capacity once LN launches... but neither of those really answers the question.. to why can't use an increase for short term relief.. but don't worry I been here long enough to know not to poke the bear... we'll leave it alone

University of California,  Davis... and yes I graduated with a BS in Civil Engineering.. but as most Engineers know... Civil is broken into 5 or so subdivisions Structural,  Environmental,  Water Resources,  Geotechnical,  and yes.. Transportation ..

Lol... when will they learn 
@_date: 2018-09-17 23:29:33
The tutorial goes into editing the configuration file... but there is 1 line you have to omit ..and substitute it for the pruning line
@_date: 2018-09-17 22:28:50
So i downloaded bitcoin core wallet couple weeks ago.. download a pruned version of the blockchain.. made a few transactions to my eclair lightning node... opened up a few channels.... my question tho..  what do i need to do to ensure my bitcoin core wallet continues to sync to the block chain?? Does it do it automatically in the back ground ?? What else should i do to ensure i'm contributing to the network??
@_date: 2018-09-05 22:56:51
If you want some rushed product.. there are many alts that have popped up in the last year or two that you can try..... i prefer a fully vetted and tested proven system with slow and steady growth... ....im actually setting up my lightning node soon.. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 23:51:02
Thats odd.. checked yesterday.. had 3 channels.. to 3 nodes.. 1)acinq, 2).the author of the tutorial and cant remember the 3rd node... all 3 have normal status..  and all 3 are funded with btc.. and i know my copy is pruned because only like 40 gigs of my harddrive is occupied... (first time i didn't prune and the sync crashed because i ran outta space around 220 gigs).... 
@_date: 2018-09-17 23:27:02
You have to add a line of code to the configuration file ( tutorial doesn't mention it)... i had to do a little research... literally 1 line.. ....i'm not at my computer so i don't know it by heart.. ..and everything else works the same... currently says i have 3 open lightning channels... .. haven't attempted to make a transaction yet... but so far so good..

Your investment mind set is all wrong... lol.. ...the amount per btc is meaningless.. he could have bought 10,000 btc for all we know... 90 percent is still 90 percent
@_date: 2018-10-05 19:23:56
Yea i understand that statement.. but not sure how that applies to the situation.. yes 90% of $20k is more than 90% of $30.. but what does that have to do with his quote..
@_date: 2018-10-05 19:02:52
Tyou don't know how much he lost.. you only know the price if btc when he got in... he coulda bought $10k worth of btc at $30... 90% is 90%
@_date: 2018-10-06 00:42:58
I forgot about those ones...ha
@_date: 2018-10-06 01:01:16
But Charlie didn't state how much he invested.. he only stated WHEN he invested .. so no one knows if he lost the amount for a meal or a couple months wages..
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:03:53
 That's not really a good comparison... 
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:29:27
 We should probably delete this one
@_date: 2018-10-05 19:01:27
I don't think you quite get it... there is literally no difference...  he coulda invested 100k when btc was at $30... or invested 100k when btc is at $20k... losing 90% of your investment is the same 
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:10:33
The numbers are obviously arbitrary,  but the general public has to switch that mindset...If your holdings total $25,000 which is considerably more than $5200 ($100/wk) ... then you've made a sound investment.. doesn't really matter if it's 1 bitcoin or not..
I think a lot of people focus too much on their inability to purchase an entire bitcoin.. but when you think of it in terms of percent gains.. it doesn't matter whether you have 0.5 , 5 , or 50 bitcoin.. i hope one day the community starts referring to price of bitcoin in mBits, i honestly think that would help with adoption..

@_date: 2018-10-05 19:14:29
He never said how many he had.. so that's irrelevant... he only stated the price it was at when he bought... you're assuming he didn't have a substantial loss.. but you can't assume that based on his quote... all we know is he lost 90 percent of his investment

It would be the equivalent of a hot wallet... there is some vulnerability there... but to go back to the real wallet analogy..  you don't keep thousands in your back pocket... you only keep what you need for day to day transactions... larger transactions are still settled on the first layer.. but will be cheaper because a majority of transactions will happen on later 2

You 'd be surprised... but More importantly a bug can't just "be introduced"... a new BIP would have to be generated.. at that time full review and testing is done before its even considered.. after that it must be accepted by 95% of the community (in most cases).. in  which it is reviewed again...

You still don't quite understand how LN is intended to work.. when lighting is user ready.. you won't have to do any of what you're saying manually.. and if it helps you understand.. think of your LN wallet like a real wallet... you might put a $20 In your wallet and walk around with it for days or weeks... when you're ready to spend you spend some... leave the rest in your wallet.. if a channel closes its okay.. funds in it will be returned...  a new one will open up automatically and you can fund that one..
