It may be less elaborate.  Perhaps he generated some real cash as an early miner and hasn't paid his taxes to the ATO...

The US and Australia require you to disclose offshore holdings. I believe the article references an offshore trust.

You actually don't need anything from the IRS to make large transfers.  You simply need to meet the organizations KYC regs..  
If you have over $10,000 in foreign accounts you will need to file an FBAR with the IRS by June 30th.  
If you have over $50,000 in foreign assets you have to file a FATCA form 8938 with your tax returns.

I've used a variety of services to transfer funds from the US to Australia and you did very well!!!

Really.  Was that necessary?

Mike, correct "knew" to "new" in this sentence:  "how the situation had played out thus far, I honestly did not want to give our provider another dollar or our hard-earned money and very much wanted a knew provider."
Really enjoy coinfire, keep your course!

But, circle doesn't support ACH in his country, right?

Tom,  I believe when you said cost basis you intended to say the cost of acquisition.  It wouldn't be based on the current price, but, the cost when they were acquired..

"Of the total donations, 532 BTC were provided from my wife and I at an approximate cash value of $87,326"
I'm sorry, but, this just smells wrong to me.  Considering what Jason's told us about his past I can't get my head around this statement.  
I've worked with a lot of non-profits, small and large, and providing accounting for the funds is paramount.

transferwise.com would have worked better than a wire transfer.

Why does the Winklevoss Index (WinkDex) website not list Coinbase?
I really like the website and I've just downloaded the app, but, I've always wondered why they don't list Coinbase....

Do I understand this correctly?  Currently Circle "only supports linking US bank accounts".  So, the transaction looks like this:
1. You are buying bitcoins in Belarus with your credit card.
2. You pay paying Circle a credit card fee which is 2.9% USD?
3. You pay a cash advance fee on the credit card of some amount?
4. You transfer the bitcoin to your US Coinbase account.
5. You sell the coins pay Coinbase a 1% + .15 bank fee?
5. You transfer the cash to your US account.
If I've got it correct it's probably better than Western Union, but, not superior to other money transfer services available like Transferwise...

Ben, I've read the early questions about Sean's Outpost and I truly appreciate your work.  You have a great reputation of asking the important questions, thank you!

Very well done!! Enjoyed the read!

Is the transfer to the bitcoin company a wire transfer or an eft?  I'm certainly no expert on banking, but, I believe they are different.  Also an international wire transfer is typically much more expensive than a domestic wire transfer...
@_date: 2014-09-29 20:07:26
Can you link your Australian Bank account?
Edit:  I see below that "at the moment Circle only supports linking US bank accounts and credit/debit cards."

I thought this was the same calculator I linked to a few days ago.  I really like it, but, isn't it exactly the same as

We have both US and Australia accounts and I've deposited US checks in Australia, but, I must say I felt thoroughly ripped off by the fees and exchange rate...

I predict Abra will run into trouble as they represent "Instantly send any amount of money directly from the app to anyone in the world" while "every transaction is private with no need to give a SSN or personal information".  
Me thinks they will run afoul of some US laws....

And the tellers charge fees so the transfer is not without fees.  I see a place for it if the foreign party is unbanked, but, it won't replace Transferwise for my needs.

Thanks!  Looking forward to your review of the software and UX.

If the buy and sell are made instantly then I don't understand the tax concern...  No gain or loss.

CBA and NAB in Australia have this service.  The ad's and articles imply that you can access the code from your smart phone app if you've forgot your card or wallet.  You can also authorize a non account holder to get cash....  Pretty cool, IMHO.  Competition is finally driving technology advancements in banking.  
I don't know of a US Bank that has the service yet...
Here's an article on it:

Transferwise is probably a better solution.
