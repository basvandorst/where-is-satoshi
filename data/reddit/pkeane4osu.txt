So use Bitaddress.org and get a paper wallet? 
@_date: 2014-07-24 04:37:15
It was stored on my computer with bitcoin core. The address was never used to send or receive from anyone but me. The only reason I was trying to restore my wallet is because it was a suggestion from a friend.  The address I speak of that says it doesn't exist is were my coins were sent to by whom ever has gotten into my computer and somehow also got into my wallet and stole my coins. When I checked the address the message I received is "the address does not exist in the system" I did not lose access to my address they were removed 100%.

I love your post. I really think that it's people like you and others like myself that really show how great bitcoin and crypto currencies are and the community of people being them. Everyone is so helpful and loves expanding the reach and range of bitcoin. This is what I believe will spread bitcoin and alt's to where we all collectively want our currencies to go. And that's to help make a change in this really messed up world at the moment. Keep it up and thanks for being a great member of the community.

That's OK I would have too. I just had not a clue as to where to start. I knew that would be a joke but I had to start somewhere.

Like I said above I will be home in 30 minutes or so and I'll post the addresses then as I don't have the recipient address, but what I'm also telling you is the wallet I said they went to, has nothing it shows no balance nor any output. So I don't understand it. It was sent 5.5 BTC but it doesn't exist has no balance and has no output. I don't know if this is possible but you know how someone could mask their identity or whereabouts by stealing and using someone else's IP address. Is it at all possible this could be done with bitcoin addresses? It the only thing I can possibly think of or at least this is what it reminds me of.

Yes I have completely power washed my computer.  Plus I quarantined my wallet just for the purposes of being able to continue to look into this problem

Well friend, I too can see your concerns, can we control them? Not so much. But I take a look at when I started right before October of 2011. I bought in with a relatively smaller amount for buying in an investment. I bought 2000.00 usd at 17.74 a coin. 10 days later or so btc price was less than  1.00 usd. I at that moment had really little choice because what return would I get out of these coins, however I did think about it, but luckily I did not need the money and I have pursued a fantastic life to this point. Most or about 63% of my portfolio stands mainly with btc and add about 7 % we will loosely say is holdings in mainly 2 other coins. So I hear and truly feel your frustration in the great sub you wrote. 
Now you hit the nail directly on the head in my opinion with all these scams, hacks and people who care solely about themselves and can't see the forest from the trees. I believe these are the group that must be isolated and push away from this great thing we have. Take this thought for example, and let me dissolve the huge importance the general public has on our success or failure. But this is how I see things and how Nakamoto's group quite possibly for seen the future too. With the core wallet of Nakamoto having the ability to sink this ship, I truly believe that they have given us such a great future with this amazing development they handed over to us. I must pause cause some may take this out of context, I am in no way relating the core group known to most as Nakamoto to a divine figure as I proceed. that said, back on point, they literally handed this great and powerful achievement to us to basically do as we wish with it. If it helps the world as I believe they intended and watch the world come together and start to achieve and see the greatness we were given. I believe they will continue to allow us to flourish and assist us along the way and grow further TOGETHER. 
Now for the bad part of what I believe was also part of there plan. With all these negative results and negative impact we read about almost every single day anymore. Once we have destroyed, or sorry have sunk bitcoin and the positive vision it was developed for to the point of no return. This too is where I see the group without a doubt saying enough is enough. This is when they come out and absolutely flood the market and take the very thing they gave us away, and believe me when I say this, it will be taken from us quicker that it was Given to us. 
I really want to expand on the integration inot the general public, but I feel I've taken to much time. If nothing was heard or read of my post, I hope this rumbles through the hearts and minds of anyone that reads this. The bitcoin community and all the communities that have branched off of bitcoin MUST take a stand against these people that only can see there lives in the matter of minutes or hours. These people are the ones ruining something the whole world could share in and grow together. So I am very passionate about this subject and really hope I made some sense to The great person whom wrote this sub for me to elaborate my own comments on. Also I hope some readers to were somewhat interested in my view.

Well where do you live, I will tell you I did this for a group I was working remotely with and when they went to drop off the 4 pizzas they wouldn't leave the pizzas cause they couldn't show the card. Just a heads up.
@_date: 2015-04-27 03:32:38
No biggie I would have done it for you, sorry I just caught the tweet
@_date: 2015-04-27 03:21:54
Are you being serious or is this a 2009er pizza joke? 
@_date: 2015-03-18 23:04:08
It was on Andreas's, honestly wonderful, 3.30 android wallet. I was kinda careless, so really I was wide open for it happening. Their gone, nothing can really be done, unless you want to get into a war with a group of hackers. But like I said I was kinda careless and THIS IS NOT ANY WAY TO BE TAKEN AS A DEROGATORY COMMENT towards his wallets. I tested version 4.0 for him and started using it October 7th. 61 bitcoin has come and gone with not a speck of dust stolen. It's now a HD wallet.

Actually, to update my prior post about not being able to buy from them for basically 2 days. About an hour later I checked the site once again for the hell of it, to my surprise I was able to finally buy and not a tiny amount but my weekly limit. So it looks like you Happen to be in the wrong place, unfortunately. I feel bad for you op but it was a very small amount, not that it's right but there are way more bigger issues that could have happened. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 22:38:09
Yup I've been trying to buy my 1000.00 weekly limit all day yesterday and today. So I had some suspensions, but nothing was really being said until I just read the tweet about this post. They have been having a ton of issues, according to an email sent to me from their PR Director. And that was about 3 weeks ago he sent that email stating their platform was loaded with bugs since December, however he stated ALL was resolved. That was as I said 3 weeks ago. I'm sorry to hear that my friend. All these negative things that keep popping up sure are not helping us get bitcoin out smoothly to the public. Such a shame.

I feel bad anytime someone loses coin in a negative way, so yes I feel bad for him. But what's funny is I had 5.5 bitcoin stolen from me last year around this time, and my sub was just informing people that a group was brute forcing wallets. Now I had to take that sub down because no one was taking me serious. In his case a much smaller amount and he is being supported. It's funny but I think it's very kind 
@_date: 2015-02-11 21:53:53
Nice sub and very kind of you to do this. Need more like you :)

I live in the states just for reference to a reply below directed to you I believe.
