In hindsight, a more fitting title for this post would have been "please improve the subreddit description". I'm relatively new to reddit so I didn't realize that going to the sidebar was standard protocol. That being the case, I suppose a banner isn't necessary. Though I still think it'd be cool to have a nice quote like "the currency of the internet" in the banner. Regardless, the additions to the sidebar I think are a great improvement.

@_date: 2013-06-28 07:19:30
Yes, but your post implies the flaw is that a merchant has to take an additional step to sell the coins, which they don't have to. If you just meant that USD is more usable than bitcoin, well that is simply because Bitcoin hasn't gained widespread adoption enough yet to where you can buy everything you need in it. This, too, is not a flaw at all. It takes time to build the fundamentals/usability of a new currency.
@_date: 2013-05-05 00:50:44
I think some of the points the author made are somewhat irrelevant. For example
 &gt;"PayPal would have to link your identity to your account and eliminate the user-defined privacy aspects of bitcoin." 
You don't have to use paypal for purchases that you wish to be anonymous. The current system we have would still be in place, and you would have the OPTION of paypal. All in all, good article though.

The problem with trying to compare this chart to Bitcoins is that every time an announcement is made, or a new development occurs in Bitcoin, the whole thing resets. Unlike other technologies where it is what it is.
@_date: 2013-12-06 06:12:47
It already has. It is at the first sell-off. It's at capitulation. It's at the return to normal. It's at the new paradigm.
I could make any of the above statements depending on how far I want to zoom in and out on the BTC graphs. Besides, this is a new technology and as such has too many factors effecting its price for that model to be relevant.
@_date: 2013-08-14 06:42:32
I think it is great news. Fantastic, in fact. Why? Because if Bitcoin is to become successful, it will of course have to be investigated by regulators. This was an inevitability, and it only shows that we are progressing to the next step as planned. Regulators have a job to do, and they're just doing it. If you haven't seen it, here is a link to the CNBC interview about bitcoin with the guy who issued the subpoenas: 
You'll notice he even states that there's "no beef". Part of the reason some large investors haven't gotten in is because this conversation hasn't happened yet. It's happening now, and looks as though it will be fair, which is all Bitcoin needs to shine; a fair shot.
Or I could be completely wrong. As you said, no one knows for sure.

Am i the only one happy about this? There were two possibilities: Bitcoin is regulated in the US. Or Bitcoin is effectively banned in the US. We can't really expect Bitcoin to go under the radar forever, and so it looks like we got the better of the two options. Also this will relieve entrepreneurs who were hesitant that the government would "ban" Bitcoins.

The problem with this is if they are under the impressions that Bitcoins aren't divisible then they may dismiss it entirely as ever being used for transactions. Then when an opportunity to learn more about it arises, they won't bother because that one misconception makes them think they're worthless.

A thief would now have to get into the account, change the password, wait for the time delay to expire, disable the time delay time (for which there would also be a time delay), then once that expired, move the coins out. Sounds much better to me than them getting in, stealing the coins, and getting out in 30 seconds.
A solution to this would also be to just have a time delay on password changes, during which the rightful owner could come in and cancel the password change. This would go back and forth ad infinitum between the thief and rightful owners changing the pass back and forth, and the thief would never get the coins, all he could do is troll the account holder with password change requests until he gets bored. Trolls gonna troll

Would be really great if NY Times allowed it. Also, this is why I disagree with people who say it doesn't make sense for Paypal to adopt Bitcoins right now. With BitPay making moves like this, by the time Paypal realizes they should get in the game, there may not be many merchants left for them (for better or worse). 
Anyway, if you read this, BitPay, I just want to thank you for all the great work you do. It's great to have your team on our side!

Just got it and have been looking for something just like this. However, the price is off. It says 138. Even when going into the app, the buy, sell, low, and highs are off too.
Suggestion: allow users to set a price when if crossed a "buzz-text-message-type-lockscreen-notification" appears so you don't have to constantly go into your phone to know if the price rose to X or dropped to Y.

That is a terrible example. And yes, if someone operates a public transportation company they have responsibilities, if only moral, to sell it to someone who will keep the public safe. Look, this person had a popular site, sold it to someone who put up malware, then proceeded to make the same site under a new name and tells us all to go there. It is sketchy to say the least and Bitcoin has seen too much shady business. It makes us look bad when we are at a very vulnerable stage. If AlpineWolf sold it and that was the end of it, fine. But to now tell us to go to his new site is ridiculous. Once it gets popular enough he'll end up selling that one too and we'll be in the same spot. But it's ok, he'll PROMISE his third site will be for real :)

All too often I see posts on here of people losing their coins and they always begin with "I got an email saying coins got sent out of my account".
With this, they would instead get an email saying "a request to move coins out of your account has been made, you have X hours to cancel it"
They log in, cancel the transfer, change their pass/2 factor authentication, no coins lost.

Then it would be a waste of money and they wouldn't end up "joining them" after all. People would say "ok, Bitcoin has been bought out by the US" and then switch to litecoin or some other coin.
If they want to join and take advantage of this opportunity, then they should acquire coins legitimately without damaging the reputation of Bitcoin and then invest in US Bitcoin-related companies so that when Bitcoin reaches mass adoption, the US will be a major player both in holdings and in being home to large Bitcoin companies and enjoy the benefits that come with that.

The more you guys keep trying to push Ripple, the less I trust it. The easiest way to kill a chicken is to convince it you're its friend. This seems to be the case with Ripple because you guys plaster pro-bitcoin BS all over your site and spam the forums with it. Let the people decide whether or not it's good and stop spamming under the guise of "helping clear things up". And yes, I know you're probably going to say that you aren't affiliated with the ripple COMPANY, and no, I don't believe you.
@_date: 2013-05-31 23:49:16
No, they are meant to push the price up. People always want to buy the bottom of dips. By placing a massive wall, you are saying "ok guys, this will be the bottom, buy now or get left behind." It gives people the confidence to buy which pushed the price up. If the person behind the wall actually wanted that many coins at that price, they would have put in a series of smaller walls so that people don't get the aforementioned sense of confidence.

Based on your "Long story short", it seems like you entire argument is based on the volatility except for the last point where you complain about a circle-jerk thread found on the biggest circle-jerk website on the internet (reddit). So, to address the volatility, what you have to understand is that there is no avoiding it in the beginning for any currency. It's like driving a car in that before you can cruise at 70mph you have to go through 0mph-69mph. This isn't a problem with Bitcoin, any new currency has to go through the same process to find its equilibrium value, even newfound countries who first started producing their own fiat would see wild volatility. It's the free market and it's a beautiful thing. 
**Once Bitcoin has become all it can be, and everybody who can know about it and understand it does know about it and understand it, you will have a stable price. Every day we take a step closer.**

I think it's safe to say that the government understands everything there is to know about Bitcoin and then some. For that reason, they won't one day go "hey, this Bitcoin thing it catching on, we should stop it". They already know what it's capable of and they have already declined the opportunities to ban it in the past when they would have had a much easier time doing so. It was also talked about at the g8 summit among the world's most powerful and yet we see no major powers banning it. I think they see this as an inevitability and hopefully an opporrtunity.

This leaves a huge opening. First being a change of priorities (unlikely isn't a very reassuring word), the second being an increase in resources for one of 1 million different reasons. They also state that it is, in fact, a priority. Just not a high one.
Additionally, that is the work of the judicial branch. Banning bitcoin would require the legislative branch to pass legislation banning Bitcoin, followed by a cooperation of the other branches to enforce them. And again, one is a drug that can be grown in your house, the other is a technology that could help the US prosper.
@_date: 2013-08-14 17:14:20
I agree, but I can't blame them for not seeing a technology like Bitcoin coming, so there will of course be some problems with existing laws. And let me make clear that I'm not convinced that trying to regulate Bitcoin is a good thing, but talking with regulators is a necessary stepping stone, regardless of what comes from it.

Services like Bitpay automatically convert money paid in bitcoins into USD for the merchant so that no work is required on the merchant's end. There are some companies, like ASIC manufacturers, who do not use bitpay and could be responsible for large dumps. Regardless, this is not a fundamental flaw, or even a flaw at all.

Personally, I'm in this, and will stay in it forever, because of what Bitcoin stands for. If you're hanging on every bit of news and having a heart attack every time Clark Moody beeps then you're doing it wrong (unless that's what you like, which is fine). I believe in honest money, and that's exactly what Bitcoin is. I don't mind riding the swings because I know it's a necessity for any new disruptive tech until it reaches mass adoption and settles in equilibrium. I know it can sometimes be a circlejerk around here, but even examining Bitcoin through my most critical lense, I still see it as something that will make the world a better place and that honestly helps me sleep at night. It's potential as an investment is the icing on the cake.

I posted this because if it takes off, it could lay the framework for an easy transition into mass adoption for Bitcoin with a simple integration into the app. "Pay with Bitcoin and save 5%". Or perhaps when transferring money to friends/overseas acquaintances, they could do what Kipochi does and instantly exchange the money into BTC then exchange it back into the local currency of wherever the recipient is - using Bitcoin without knowing you're using Bitcoin.

Going to zero would require so much more beyond even every government in the world outright banning it, and we're already largely past that point. Saying 80% chance of going to ZERO is nonsensical, will turn off a lot of ears immediately, and is just a very silly thing for anyone to say, especially a CEO of a Bitcoin startup.

Wrong. Only very basic parts of it are so that people like you can tout that it's open sourced. And yes, they are trying to get XRP to attract BTC users like a parasite then the owners of ripple and their premined XRP will make a ton of money off BTC users.

Why? By not assisting any politician, you're only helping the corruption by giving the bad players who DO assist more leverage. Think money should be taken out of politics period? Well there are politicians who share that stance and unfortunately have to play by the current rules and need donations in order to get to a spot where they can make that change.
Not all politicians are corrupt (do I get banned from this subforum for saying that?). With that in mind, when donating, Bitcoin certainly is a superior way to do it.

Keep in mind that Bitcoin is also money. While you can just buy and sell it like stocks, you can also use it to buy goods. Reddit, for example takes them for gold. Also you can order food with foodler, electronics with bitcoinstore.com, and just about everything using gyft which is a company that sells giftcards you can use on your smartphone and recently began accepting bitcoins. When possible, try to buy things with Bitcoins to support the economy in this early stage.
@_date: 2013-07-31 04:39:52
My point is they can't turn on a dime, there is no law making Bitcoin illegal so someone would first have to write one up and pass it. Also the process for passing a Bill banning Bitcoin will take a long time with the way congress works and will be met with a lot of resistance considering the VC's we have invested in this as well as other countries who have an interest in keeping Bitcoin legal in the US.

Comboy, if you read this, you've been around long enough to understand how important it is that we start using mBTC (I assume, because I'm relatively new to BTC and i've read quite a bit on the topic. If that's not the case for you, I'd be happy to explain it). Let me start by saying I love your site, and I can't tell you how many people i've referred to it. I suspect you'll hit a record amount of viewers as we creep closer to 1k, and everyone will be expecting another hilarious gif. A sudden switch to mBTC will make it finally sink in (maybe throw in a gif too, ya know, for the lols).
We can shout about doing this in the forums and on reddit all we want, but until a big player does something we won't see any change.
Possibly most important is the fact that media outlets will likely make reports on the price hitting 1,000 and if they happen to look at Bitcoinity for a graph, they will throw the mBTC switch into their reports.
Regardless, keep being awesome.

lol thank you, but i've been trading for a fair amount of time and understand that. You could still derive an average price for the bitcoin based on the average price of the last bitcoin sold across all the exchanges. This average price would not be something you could trade at, but rather a new way to gauge the worth of a bitcoin other than whatever the last price at gox was.
@_date: 2013-09-29 19:17:09
Coinbase uses the exchange Bitstamp for its prices. The reason it's cheaper is because MtGox is having issues with letting people withdraw USD. You can't sell from coinbase into MtGox, but you can send your coins from your coinbase wallet, to your MtGox wallet and then sell. But be careful, because you may never be able to get your USD out of MtGox, nobody really knows when (or if), they will fix their USD withdrawal problem.

Part of the problem, at least, is that those people aren't intentionally lying, but rather they're just misinformed. Who misinformed them? People invested in assets that Bitcoin threatens. Also, always remember that your average person doesn't even know what open source means, and doesn't know what decentralized means in this context, so they honestly think it's a scam and are trying to help others avoid it. That will continue to change as the word gets out on what Bitcoin actually is. Remember to do your part where you can.

The same way you would earn USD as a young person. Provide something people want in exchange for Bitcoins. Or provide something that people want in exchange for USD then convert it to Bitcoins. If you are too young to use an online exchange then you are also too young for localbitcoins so talk to a parent or guardian about Bitcoins, what they are, why you want them, what you plan to do with them, and I'm sure they will help you get some.

Perhaps my definition is a bit off, but doesn't "clampdown" imply something bad. The article seems to imply that Bitcoin was never meant to be money.


I'm actually sure he did. I'm sure he knew that Bitcoin would either flop, or eventually endure attempts to regulate it. It's debatable on whether regulation is even a bad thing, and I don't like how the article implies that regulation goes against everything Bitcoin stands for. Even if Bitcoin was regulated by some means, it still solves a whole lot of issues that we currently have to deal with for Fiat currencies because those fixes are part of the code that makes a Bitcoin a Bitcoin, so it would still be a great success.

Mt.Gox got a jump on the market early and so they became very big early on. Under any other circumstance, they would have 0% of the market due to their deplorable communications with customers and countless problems (problems that wouldn't necessarily be a big deal if they would just keep us up to date, instead of a random public statement once every 2 months that often leaves more questions than answers. There's no question Mt.Gox makes a ton of money so I really don't think it's a liquidity issue, but something odd is going on and so people are nervous and rightfully so. Some have been waiting months for withdrawals and deposits too and from their site. I would stay away from them by all means until their problems are sorted out. Coinbase is a very good company (minus a rather slow customer service response team imo), and trustworthy because they were funded by NY venture capital and so they aren't some shady company in Japan like mt.gox is. They are making a lot of great innovations for Bitcoin including incorporating micro-transactions into wordpress and apparently a Bitcoin text message buy/sell/exchange service that I see on the front page today but haven't read yet. This leads me to believe they are too invested in their business, and too accountable to try and scam you.

Welcome! You are coming in at one of the most exciting times for Bitcoin. You're right about probably not making much with the USB miner, but you have the right mindset and it really is a cool technology to be involved with.
We all have different reasons for getting started, personally I love the idea of a non-state controlled currency and feel good about supporting one. Being able to print money is ludicrous to me. A lot of people, myself included, are also in it as an investment. Being capped at 21 million, should Bitcoin fulfill it's full potential the price will per bitcoin will be many many times more than it is now (but fulfilling its full potential is long way away). In the short to mid-term, a lot of the price action will depend on these talks with US regulators and other government bodies that i'm sure you've heard about. As long as the result is reasonable, and right now I'd say things are looking good in terms of giving bitcoin an honest look based on some quotes i've read as well as the cnbc interview with the NY regulator, then I think we can expect much larger players to enter the market which means more innovation and a higher value for the Bitcoin.
Tread carefully short term though, because as you may know, the largest exchange, mt.gox, is having bank troubles and people are having a lot of trouble withdrawing USD from their site. This gives incentive to buy bitcoins there and move to a new exchange to sell them (which leaves behind a higher price at mt.gox and a bit of a messy valuation per BTC). Fortunately, Coinsetter should be coming online soon which I am very hopeful for. They are a new exchange and appear to be doing everything right.

Not at all. If Bernanke opened his statements by saying "the USD sucks" the global financial system would implode. If satoshi came back and posted on Bitcointalk.org saying "Bitcoin sucks", people would check to see if there was some glitch in the code, see there wasn't, and say "ok, then feel free to leave it".
Don't get me wrong, Satoshi is my God, but at then end of the day Bitcoin doesn't give a fuck what anyone says about it.
@_date: 2013-05-17 04:24:17
Right now the price of BTC is what mt.gox says it is. So if something bad happens to mt.gox, and people sell at mt.gox, people say "bitcoin is crashing" and the price of BTC goes down with it. If the price of BTC was based off an average across all exchanges, if something bad happened to mt.gox and people sell at mt.gox (just as in the scenario above), the price of BTC would drop a fraction as much and people would be less likely to panic-sell, and then those attacking Bitcoin would have less ammo.
Edit: also, having the the primary price trackers be based off mt.gox strengthens mt.gox's grip on the market because people don't want to be in an exchange where their actions have no effect on the **percieved** price of BTC.

They have given way too much of an "OK" now for them to suddenly turn around and ban them. Even James White, Director of Tax Issues at the U.S. Government Accountability Office, is a featured speaker at the Inside Bitcoin conference in NYC today. High level government employees wouldn't be featured speakers at Bitcoin conferences if there was talk about banning them.
These things can change, of course, but I would say it is highly unlikely for the US to declare Bitcoins illegal. The risk of missing the boat alone would make them think twice. Imagine a world where Bitcoin is the reserve currency and the US has none if it because they chose to ban them (lookin at you, Thailand).

And yes, I explained how they are divisible, but what about all the times when there isn't someone around to explain that they can invest as little as they'd like.
Also, this misconception that Bitcoins aren't divisible gives people the idea that Bitcoin can never be used for transactions. Remember when that Austrailian news host said "I'm not about to pay over $100 for a coffee using a bitcoin!"

* He doesn't want to be famous and have everyone ask him questions wherever he goes
* He knows the mystery of not knowing the creator adds an interesting factor to Bitcoin which helps it
* Maybe he has done some bad things or got arrested in the past and he doesn't want headlines to read "Creator of Bitcoin is a convicted criminal"
* Maybe he's just humble and is just happy knowing he gave the world a great thing
Note: I use "He" but it could be more than one person or a female

All I see is an extremely brief 2 sentence description (I'd bet 99% don't even understand the implications of a decentralized currency or what 'decentralized' even means in this context) followed by directions on how to buy them. Also some may not even make it that far upon seeing a bunch of tech-heavy posts upvoted thinking "wow, I definitely don't belong here". There's no reason not to utilize the space, and the most important thing now is building awareness and interest which brings rise to infrastructure and economy. I made this same suggestion in a comment on another post and I got this response:


Seriously that's my inner bitcoin monologue. pls help.

If someone reputable started a fund for that, I think it would be great... Where you at Trace? The charity donation idea is one I will participate in as well

I have a sneaking suspicion that, at the very least, the female anchor holds some bitcoins

Seemed to be a pretty fair article. At least they pointed out that in the early stages, volatility is to be expected. Even noted that the silk road closure would be a net positive for Bitcoin.

If/When you add Bitcoin as a checkout option, make a post here about it and you'll get a bunch of upvotes and views from the 51,000+ subscribers here. That alone should be incentive enough.
Also, myself and a lot of others here seek out companies that allow us to pay in Bitcoin and so should we ever need bike or aircraft parts, you'd be the guy.

Gotta respect that, and will make sure to give Coinsetter some of my business as a result.

That's ridiculous and untrue. It was for two pizzas.

Very well articulated and didn't come across as pushy. Almost made me want to sell my Bitcoins so I can get into them again :P

Might be the worst post i've ever seen on this subreddit.

Seems like coinbase is becoming the new mt.gox. Every day i come here I see a new post about something bad they did and how no one ever replies at their company.

The more you guys keep trying to push Ripple, the less I trust it. The easiest way to kill a chicken is to convince it you're its friend. This seems to be the case with Ripple because you guys plaster pro-bitcoin BS all over your site and spam the forums with it. Let the people decide whether or not it's good and stop spamming under the guise of "helping clear things up". And yes, I know you're probably going to say that you aren't affiliated with the ripple COMPANY, and no, I don't believe you.

Yes. We are not saying "Hey guys, come put all you money into Bitcoin!" We are saying this may be an opportunity to spread awareness and help business adoption in the region to gradually build a strong Brazilian Bitcoin economy to then allow a more seamless transition from 6% inflation to a currency with 0% inflation with a more stable price.

Here is a start, though I think some could use some additional explanation. From Emansipator on Bitcointalk.org:
**To a techie:**  Bitcoin is Money Over Internet Protocol
**To an economist:**  Bitcoin is irreversible, ultrasecure, mathematical cowry shells
**To an entrepreneur:**  Bitcoin is digital money Lego--you can use it to build anything
**To grandma:**  Bitcoin is money that you can send like email
**To a merchant:** Bitcoin is no service fees, no specialised hardware, and no chargebacks
**To a first generation immigrant:**  Bitcoin is 90% off Western Union fees for everyone
**To Joe Everyman:**  Bitcoin is a 5% discount on online shopping
**To your great-grandchild:**  Dollar bills were how people paid for things before we had Bitcoin

Hopefully all the major players get on this ASAP. Major props to Bitcoinity

So has anyone said anything about how the meeting went?

I'll take my 1BTC though
@_date: 2013-08-27 06:19:32
Bitpay instantly converts any BTC payment into USD and deposits the USD into the merchant's account. I believe coinbase does too. This eliminates any concern for the volatility.

I'm definitely not the best person to answer that, but I do remember a really cool video on the topic (can't attest for whether or not the video is accurate though): 
@_date: 2013-07-15 06:34:47
Largely, I agree with this. Here is a post from bitcointalk that I found did a good job of shedding light on the situation

Glad you already thought this through, and that sounds like a solid strategy to me, particularly being able to switch between the two in preferences.
not sure what's in here at the moment but:
