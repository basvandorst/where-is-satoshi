Hahaha this happened to me as well, only not as major as with you. I had about 40€ worth of tips.
I think you should sell some and keep some, but also if you're interested then you can try to invest a bit in other currencies as well - though this may come with a lot of stress :D

Their older stuff is funkier anyways! I also saw them live a few years back - that was cool.
Anyways, back to Dumb and Dumber 2
Nice chat!

Just today I was talking to my parents and I brought up the topic of music and how I've grown to appreciate different kinds of music.
When I was younger, I never listened to anything, I had no influences so I had no certain favourite. But now I've started to explore, I don't say no to any kind of music until I've heard it myself. There is lots of bad stuff, but the overwhelming kind just tops it massively.

For some reason alienstream is down, but I like to listen to some chillstep.
(I've been told this was in the last Hobbit also, but I haven't seen it yet)
also +1 to the rainymood guy, I like that site!

Your link reminded me of  funny - I don't know why.
And have you listened to Flea's (Bassist of RHCP) solo album? He has some interesting stuff also!
