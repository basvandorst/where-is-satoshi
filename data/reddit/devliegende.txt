That is correct. 
Without a formal and organized system of debts it is impossible to be simultanously unproductive and independent.

Its because most people understand that civilization is not possible without debts.
 
Most of us are unproductive and dependent on others for the first 20 to 25 years of our lives. The more years people are unproductive early the more productive they're typically later.
Such a system is not possible without some sort of debt and repayment social contract. Explicit in the form of loans or implicit in the form of subsidies and taxes. Either way it is a debt.
After that buying a house or starting a business is typically done using debt. The very nature of investment that is that there is  a large upfront expense (eg to build a factory or a bridge) compansated by lots of small repayments later (income from tolls or products)
And retirement would simply be not possible unless people did not take on and repay debts from which the unproductive retirees could live off.

Where there is a savings acount, there is also a loan. One is not possible without the other. Equity (shares) are just a different form of loan. You invest in a company with the expectation of being repaid more later. That is effectively the same thing as lending money to the company. Even if you don't take on debt to educate your child, the society you live in still does.
Imagine two societies that start off with the exact same amount of wealth and development. One only use existing wealth to raise and educate children, while the other takes out a big fat loan and use the money to build a fantastic education infrastructure. Fast forward 30 years and the 2nd society will be much wealthier than the first and will be able to easily service or pay off their old debts as well as take on new debts to build ever better schools and universities.

Fiat money and debt based money are actually very old. During the Middle Ages, kings regularly recalled and re-issued their coins with new face values that had no relation to the metallic value. Merchants used credit letters as money. Cleopatra minted coins to raise funds for Anthony's wars. Governments issued talley sticks, clay tablets and other tokens as credits against future tax receipts. The examples are legion.
Retirement had always and will always require that a portion of the benefits of the labor of some accrue to the retirees. Through most of human history, this was available only for an elite few via subjugation of large portions of the rest of the population. Our modern system of formal debts and repayments is much more equitable and fair and therefore also much more widespread. The main problem with retirement and the source of much of the anxiety is that the people you are paying benefits to are not the same people you expect to collect benefits from, since they're expected to be dead when you retire. Therefore we manage the system via entities without a known expiry date such as the state, insurance companies, unions and mutual funds. It also requires that funds do  not just to go to retirees but also into investments in future workers and productivity increases. Education, infrastructure, research, technology, healthcare, security etc.  
Interest and dividends are needed to incentivise this system on both sides. For the investors (savers) to put their excess wealth into the system in order to collect the interest and for the borrowers to use the wealth in ways to create more wealth such that they can repay the loan with interest.
If everyone did like you suggests and just stored their money in unproductive ways, our society will become so poor that retirement will become be the purview of only an elite few again.
You should also consider that money does not equal wealth. Money is only a token for wealth and whereas it appears that money could be stored for long periods, real wealth will decay alarmingly fast. If everyone in a society decided to retire at the same time, they will all become very poor in a very short time, regardless of the amount or properties of the money they've saved up.

Equity is an asset for the investor and a liability for the company.
Home schoolers also benefit from infrastructure and technology, that for the most part were financed through public debts.
Do you also plan to home university your kids?
The value of dead assets such as gold and property is proportional to the overall wealth of a society, which in turn is proportional to productivity, which in turn is dependent on improvements in technology and education  and health and security, all of which are financed through various forms of debts. You may save in gold and property if you want, but if everyone in a society do likewise, that society will become very poor very quickly.
The society which took out the loan will repay that loan easily and take out a new larger loan because they are wealthier now and can afford to do so. 
As long as they keep making good investments with their loans they will keep growing wealthier and thus will never have to be debt free.
Your assertion about no society ever paying off its debts is not correct. US federal debts were paid off under Andrew Jackson.
A short while after he did so there was a deep and long ressesion.

Nothing to miss. The statements I made remain valid, whether you conflate them or not.
Illegal immigrants have an obvious self interest for staying out of criminal activity and not making use of social benefits. Under US law their is no difference between their children and those of other immigrants and the risks they take, certainly classify them as the most ambitious and enterprising of the originating population.

I read The Economist magazine. They have regular articles on the subject, normally citing work by academic economists.
Academics normally control their data for socio-economic levels. It appears the study you cited did not. Neither did they include the biggest US social programs such as Social Security.
Here is a debunking piece by the Cato institute.
cis.org appears to me to be an alt-right fake tank. If you take their reports seriously, then we won't make any progress.

There are many studies on migration concluding that immigrants commit crime and use social benefits at lower rates than natives. Children of immigrants on average are more successful and pay more tax than children of native borns.
Migrants, even very poor ones, comprise of the most entireprising and ambitious members of the society the leave behind and thus are a net benefit to the society that welcomes them.

If you have life savings of any significance, you'd have to be seriously ignorant to keep it all in a bank account.
Even more ignorant to keep any significant percentage in any volatile speculative instrument.
Ditto for keeping any significant portion denominated in any currency other than the one which denominates your living expenses.
A person of reasonable intelligence will keep his savings where he or she may expect a positive real rate of return with minimum risk and volatility.
A diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds and real estate is typically the best way to go.

That would be an especially ignorant kind of idiot then.
If he had read on the subject of protecting against inflation, he would have learned about the stock market and real estate and how they tend to have positive real rates of return.

Money is a form of debt also.
You exchange something of value for a token. Later you exchange the token for something if value. The token is a debt owed to you, by the community that has agreed to use the token. There is an implicit or explicit promise to honour the token debt and their is an accompanying possibilty of default.
This applies to all kinds of money, including bitcoin.

Starry Night happens to belong to a public museum and people do pay to see it. 
Private art collectors display their art to their friends and value the status and prestige it brings. Those that lock away art for the purpose of selling it later, do so because they know others will pay to view or display it.
Humans made and valued artistic objects from gold for thousands of years before it acquired any monetary value. Yes, people agree it has value, but they do so for an ancient underlying reason that was, and still is, very real. Even if we did not know what the underlying reason was, the very fact that it had lasted for so long should be enough evidence that it exist. 
Contrast that with the more arbitrary agreement in Amsterdam in the early 17th century, that tulip bulbs had great value - it did not last, because it had no underlying reason - no fundamentals so to speak.

For the most part, because it is so beautiful that millions of people will pay to see it. Similarly gold's value for the most part, derives from people finding it beautiful enough to want to adorn their bodies or possesions with.
