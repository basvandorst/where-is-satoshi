Thanks for your comment. 
So basically any miner can broadcast a transaction to the pool of transactions that is waiting to be mined into a block.

Until they are worthless?

Yea, Hodl until your millions is worth a few hundred dollars. Bitcoin won't be allowed to succeed.

That article says it's theoretically possible 
@_date: 2016-06-02 03:25:24
Just because current quantum computer architecture cannot compute such things doesn't mean it is impossible. Someone could use a quantum computer to break ECDSA.

Nice to see someone who knows about the SDR. However I'm afraid I have some very bad news for you. Google and look into 'Acchain'. Looks to be the one world currency  that the NWO have been wanting for years. Created by the IMF and China.

IMF only has around 3k tonnes. If you can beat em, join them. =)

The future of money is cryptos but do you really think it will be bitcoin? What's stopping the federal reserve from creating their own crypto and shoving it down everyone's throat.

Yea it's fucked haha. have a look at their YouTube channel, fucking weirdio shit that scares me. If it's confirmed that this blockchain is directly connected to the IMF... god help us

And you think sha256 will still be secure by the time humans are mining this gold?
@_date: 2017-08-30 08:32:37
A crypto currency could potentially be more centralised then our current monetory system. Don't go around making people believe all cryptos are decentralised otherwise when the Federal Reserve bring out a crypto everyone will believe their lies.

What a joke
@_date: 2017-08-15 22:32:05
New law, bitcoin is illegal... They did it to gold not to long ago.
@_date: 2016-06-02 07:51:02
Still doesn't take away from the fact that with enough resources at this moment in time someone could fuck over bitcoin with a specialized quantum computer.
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:18:53
Yea it's fucked up, was going to talk about it in original comment. Have you seen their YouTube videos? Scary stuff.
@_date: 2016-12-21 15:31:04
Central banks won't have it. Buy gold instead =)
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:52:53
The central bankers will never allow things to be priced in bitcoin. Instead they will create their own crypto when the time comes. Buy gold so you are on the same side as the fuckers with all the power.
@_date: 2019-06-09 15:02:25
That's due to the peso being devalued against the dirty fiat USD not bitcoin. if you were an Argentining who bought bitcoin with pesos you wouldnt be making anymore money than if you bought it with USD. Everything would get more expensive to deal with the drop in value of the currency. You couldve made similar gains by exchanging your pesos for any of the major currencies. or even better, gold ;)
@_date: 2019-06-10 14:14:55
You confuse me
@_date: 2017-04-25 13:46:47
Gold and silver are the best hedge for the coming collapse. Bitcoin is still good but central banks keep gold as there reserves not Bitcoin and im pretty sure you want to be on the same side as them. =)
