I know what I am invested in, no need to listen to a neck beard about Pump and dumps. Those are everywhere not just in Bitcoin. They are a part of investing, you have to know when to buy and when to get out.

No point in wasting time watching some idiot call Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme TBH
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:45:15
didn't even watch because once i saw topic i knew it would be full of shit
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:39:38
Yes but don't wait to long to go long ��
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:10:43
thanks for the updates!

hitbtc, bittrex (crypto to crypto only), kraken (non US), poloniex (same as kraken iirc), gemini (BTC/ETH only) basically just any other exchange is better than coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:27:40
you mean conbase :D
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:46:35
yes GDAX is what you should use instead of coinbase as coinbase is the handicap UI for retards who don't know any better

will take a while for segwit to be implemented in all exchanges, then we will have LN which is kind of weird to me since it's an off chain implementation and the way it wants you to send some mbtc to the network to hold

I can buy a loaf of �� with it any day, just because your vendors don't support doesn't mean it's not going to be adopted
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:14:50
no it hasn't. You was only taxed on capital gains crypto to usd gains. This here changes it to crypto to crypto gains which is total b.s and will complicate the shit out of fillings

I call bullshit on this, how can you be so ignorant as to keep this much BTC in an exchange. Seriously you wouldn't be here whining if you could afford to risk so much, you would have already hired a team of lawyers to get it back long ago. You are either fishing for attention or are extremely dumb.

Yes a bubble that will span infinitely

I haven't had any issues with them. They locked my account then asked me for verification. I actually took long to comply and they were very patient. After i send them my photo etc they replied right away and re enabled my account. I don't see a problem here

Forbes feels like the Seeking Alpha of crypto publications

they won't EVER, they enjoy control of their new altcoin

not a gamble when you know this technology is a game changer which will be used for centuries. Decentralized Applications are the future.
@_date: 2018-03-10 22:21:58
Nice, will be using this soon. Fuck bitpay and fuck Bitcoin Judas
@_date: 2018-03-30 09:32:17
1 satoshi will be worth 1 USD one day and we will pay in bits not bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-02-10 09:27:53
Bitcoin is Bitcoin, the term Bitcoin core is something to confuse users and to make the term Bitcoin by itself to be up for grabs by the BCASH community who are stuck with a hard fork that won't go anywhere no matter how much they try to pump it or raise their blocksize which was the worst scaling solution ever. Anyways, just ignore them, don't feed the trolls.
@_date: 2018-02-20 14:47:28
you're thinking to low, imagine 1 satoshis = 1 USD instead
@_date: 2018-02-22 07:05:33
SOL buddy

Paper that's laminated would work best so that key is intact, also places in a air tight and sun light protected capsule
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:10:28
Run "find / -type f -name 'wallet.dat'" just to make sure , but normally it's in ~/.bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-02-20 15:39:50
We are already used to decimals in cryptoland. I don't even look at crypto coin priced in USD anymore but in Satoshis so decimals will be the norm in the future

households with multiple credit cards, not paying on time, ordering shit they can't afford, not caring, filing chapter 11, buying shit they can't afford and did i say to many credit cards? So irresponsible of them
