i agree that MtGox could and should have.  But I still think its a dick move

dammit, just when I thought this new plastic money would solve the problem of my guinea pig eating my bills (yes it has happened) now i have to worry about my drunken self microwaving the new plastic ones.
On the plus side, i guess bitcoin solves these problems...as long as i keep my paper wallets away from the guinea pig

You can't have your cake and eat it too.  Either Bitcoin is worth practically nothing and the banks and similar organizations ignore it, or its worth a lot the big players will want to get involved

Isn't that a little overpriced given the current market?  Find me a better deal and I'll agree with you.
Unless you are talking about what you think it will be worth, which is completely different.  It would be like me saying a fair price for gold is 1500, and someone disagreeing because they think one day in the future it will be worth more

I agree because i don't even know exactly what Western Union is.  I know it is a way to transfer money in some form, but I have never used it, I have never had it be a requirement, and i honestly don't think I have ever actually heard a person say "western union"
