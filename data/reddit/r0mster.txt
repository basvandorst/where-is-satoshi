Upper management always loves to pick on lower level guys. Sounds like they are going to get a dose of reality soon.

Oh man, prepare your anus. I can hear the pitchforks being sharpened and torches being lit.

You didn't lose anything, just because it was theoretically worth something this morning doesn't mean you are entitled to that money. If you want a stable investment, buy gold.

How? It only dipped 50% and no one knows for how long.

It is, and I thought about doing it. But I can hardly get 10btc right now, let alone enough to stock and resell.

You can't be real. We are gonna wake up tomorrow and none of this ever happened.

Who cares. I wish mods would delete all this self pitying posts about how people didn't get to buy shit with money they accidentally made.

Some people invested their life savings, not just a couple hundred bucks. There are thousands who lost a little like you today, no reason to spam about it.

I see this on top every time this is asked and I wish it would be something useful for once. There is not a single available trader in my whole state right now and there almost never is. I'm pretty sure everyone knows about them but don't use them because it's definitely not reliable or well populated. The only couple of guys that are even close are constantly out of coin.
