The national debt of pretty much all countries is increasingly growing and growing. Additionally, more and more countries are printing more and more fiat currency. This is only one reason why more and more people are losing trust in fiat currency, and moving to bitcoin.

I don't mean to be cheeky, but are you a troll?  
If you are, then good one. If you're not, then you are out of touch with reality. When you convert cryptocurrency to dollars to make a purchase, you trust that those dollars are going to retain their value for the *few minutes/few hours* until you make your purchase. You don't convert cryptocurrency to dollars to make a purchase in a years time. Why would you do that? That would be moronic. Any non-moronic person who wanted to make a purchase would convert their crypto to their local fiat currency then make the purchase. They wouldn't wait a year in between. That it literally the most illogical argument I've heard this month.  
Also, take off the blinkers and look at the whole world. The dollar is likely to be strong at least for the next 7.5 years, but not everyone lives in America. Bitcoin is a global currency. Many currencies and economies around the world are dodgy. And even the dollar isn't entirely safe, as the Deep State might try to attack the US economy once all their other attacks against Trump fail.  
You don't understand the world. As well as people in countries with risky economies for whom bitcoin is a much safer option than local currency, there are also millions of people who hate globalists and hate the global banking system. The great thing about cryptocurrency is that the right people get rich. Ostriches like you miss out, while the woke people get rich.

Uniformed = Neutral (Qualifier: As long as you don't express an opinion, or turn a blind eye to horrible things happening.)  
Of all the subjects in the world you can't be expected to be informed about them all. If you express an opinion about something on which you are uninformed, then yes, that's bad. If you see something horrible happening but you don't care to learn more, then yes, that's bad. But if you have no interest in something which is outside the good/evil spectrum, then it's not bad to be uninformed. It's neutral.  
Misinformed = Bad (Someone told you BS and you swallowed it without verifying that it was correct.)

To check I understand it right, the bitcoin is stored on the Trezor, and you can only transfer it or spend it when you connect the Trezor to a phone/tablet with your mycelium wallet installed?

Wikileaks don't pick sides. They simply release the truth.  
Wikileaks released the DNC emails and the Podesta emails. The emails revealed the DNC were corrupt and Hillary was corrupt. Wikileaks simply made the truth aware to the public.  
Trump doesn't use email, and even if he did, emails can only reveal what they contain. If my emails were leaked everyone would want to employ me because they would show I was excellent at my job. Hillary is to blame for her own corruption, not the journalists (Wikileaks) who exposed her corruption.

To be fair, the national debt going down is at least partly due to obstructionist democrats and obstructionist RINOs preventing anything from getting done!  
Trump's $103 billion reduction is just a drop in the ocean compared to the $9.3 trillion Obama added to the debt. But yes, it's early days in terms of influence. To suggest Trump has had no effect at all is moronic, but it's after 8 years when we'll have a better picture of how his record stands on national debt.

In the UK, if a bank goes bust only the first few thousand of your savings are protected. You have zero protection for the rest, so if a bank goes bust and your life savings are substantial, you will lose the majority of your life savings.

Also, governments can, and have, seize your money.

This was after Iceland went bankrupt and defaulted on payments owed to the UK. The UK government responded by seizing the exact amount owed to the UK from Icelandic companies.

Soros is pro-EU. Catalonia declaring independence is a headache the EU doesn't need, so it's unlikely that Soros supports Catalonia's declaration of independence.  
Soros has helped create civil wars when it furthers his agenda, i.e Ukraine, and attempted it with US, but I don't see how Catalonia declaring independence helps his agenda. A civil war in Spain would just cause problems for the EU at a time when Soros wants the EU to have greater power.  


I agree with you on this. Some bitcoin supporters will be pro-Catalonia independence, and some bitcoin supporters will be against pro-Catalonia independence. This sub isn't the place to debate the politics. The thing we can agree on though, is that given the economic uncertainty in Spain right now, it's a good time for the people of Spain and Catalonia to invest in bitcoin.

Someone in their 50s would probably be best advised to go for low risk low return investments, with the majority of their investment.  
Someone in their 20s can afford to go for some investments with a greater chance of massive returns, even if they are allegedly a bigger risk.  
That said if you listed ten shares and bitcoin, and I had to pick which had the best chance of showing the greatest percentage increase over the next five years, I would pick bitcoin.

Soros is a known currency manipulator, and Seaman claims Soros' people have been attacking bitcoin on twitter. Seaman's assumption is that Soros wants to damage public confidence in bitcoin, and plans to offload to get the price to drop.  
However, given Soros' track record, this seems like a flawed assumption to me. Couldn't the twitter attacks be because Soros wants to get the price to drop so that he can buy up bitcoin at a cheaper price? After all, Soros is a known currency manipulator. Wouldn't it be safe to assume that Soros would therefore also seek to profit by manipulating cryptocurrencies?
