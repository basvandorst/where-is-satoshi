I really just wanted to ask when you all think the price will go back down to about $100, or if it'll continue to get more expensive as these companies try to keep up with demand. 
I had to beat around the bush to avoid being flagged by bots trying the deflect daily BTC price questions.
I was gonna get one for a family member... Wondering if I should wait.

This was shared in the Bitcoin Milwaukee Facebook group if any one is interested.
There was a debate about whether or not Bitcoin theoretically being infinitely divisible was the same as having an uncapped money supply.

No Capital Gains Tax in Puerto Rico (Source: Peter Schiff) and I think even the Virgin Islands. Taking a cruise to both islands shortly. Seriously considering moving my business there. My lady is seriously considering it too.

Yes, that would be step 1 in diversifying against the dollar.
I am bit further along than that. 
Of course 401k matching from larger employers is stupid to turn down. You get instant 100% (or close to) gains on every dollar you put in, plus compounding interest over the course of several decades. The equities market with proper 401k contribution has made more millionaires than any other tool. It also happens to be the only legal way to invest 100% tax free that I know of (No income tax, no capital gains tax, no sales tax). This optimizes the amount of capital at your disposal to invest, making it a "no brainer."  
However, I still want a portion of that in Bitcoin (I have little long term trust in the dollar, the Fed, and the U.S. Stock Market). And, can you imagine the capital gains tax you would avoid by using an IRA!? Imagine Bitcoin hits the moon and John McAffee doesn't eat his member. The tax savings are profound.
The other silver lining is the penalty for cashing out early. If Bitcoin surges, its often overwhelming difficult to resist the urge to cash out instead of HODL. The IRA disincentives this with penalties, making HODL the number 1 priority or "Plan A." If the market becomes truly bear, you can roll it over into something else but at least you are doing it for reasons other than instant gratification.

Probably, its refurbished however. Its got good enough specs for school and room for upgrades, but I didn’t sink much money into it.

Bitcoin is an alternative to weaponized counterfeit money. The Federal Reserve can manifest $1 Trillion dollars with less resources than it takes to manifest a fart. 
I use Bitcoin because it is unethical for such a small class of people to create their own property which they use to drive the working class like cattle.
I don't care how it fluctuates. Its a voluntary and egalitarian system which incentives participation. Mining creates digital assets based on work and contribution, which is the exact opposite of our Deuteronomy War Money Magicians.
It's better than what we have right now.
God Bless Satoshi.
