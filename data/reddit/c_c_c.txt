His denial and the reporter's claim are not equivalent. The only thing the Newsweek article has is that he has the same name and the cryptic quotes attributed to Dorian Nakamoto regarding bitcoin. If you claim I'm Satoshi, you need to prove it. I don't have to disprove it.

It does make a difference though because the article was very flimsy on facts. Without him admitting he is Satoshi, the article is worthless. MIght as well have written that I'm Satoshi.

No, he could have just refused to talk to the original Newsweek reporter. Something here really stinks. Without any further evidence to show one way or the other this is looking like a complete scam by Newsweek/McGrath

True it won't prove Dorian is/is not Satoshi but it would show that that's really Satoshi posting.

Exactly this. There is no proof in the original article at all except some cryptic quotes and the coincidence of the name. If Dorian says he's not Satoshi that's pretty much it until something else is discovered.

If he isn't Satoshi there isn't much use in writing 2,000 words.

I want to believe but no signature makes me wary.

No. Nothing is settled. But based on what's available right now it looks like McGrath just found someone who happened to be named Satoshi Nakamoto

I read through all of them and this is extremely fascinating. Thanks!

He doesn't *clearly* admit to anything in the article. There is no confession here.






Edit: Bunch of qualifiers and weasel words in there.
