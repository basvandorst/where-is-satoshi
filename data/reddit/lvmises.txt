I’m having flashbacks to when this happened with online poker.  For quite a while some could get money, some could not. Banks told people different things.  Did not take long tho for all banks in the US to block the major sites

Ill keep trying.  Think about what the current price is.  Its a prediction of the future price based on relative risk and some other factors.   If you want to make 20% on asset A given its risk profile and everyone else in the world also wants to make 20% on that asset then the price today should be the same as the expected price a year from now discounted by 20%.  
Again - don't get up on the word "future" in a futures contract as the word only applies to when the contract ends and the final money changes hands.  The contract is made today based on today information.  Today's information include an estimate of the price in the future (see above) and the futures price includes that information and other factors like carry costs but it does not include any new information about the price in the future that is not already incorporated into the price today.

You are correct, but I would say it a bit differently, that a futures contract can be used by a commodity producer to lock in close to today prices for something they are going to produce in the future.  Also a commodity consumer can lock in todays prices for something they are going to consume in the future

I'm sorry but that's wrong - a futures contract has nothing to do with the price in the future.  Below a section from a post I posted in explaining this:
The most important thing to understand and explain well about futures is the name "futures" is misleading. Futures are not a bet on what the price will be in the future. That is a very common misunderstanding, but the nature of arbitrage forces futures prices to be something very different than a bet on the future price.
In theory, the market price of any asset TODAY is a bet on its future and includes all the information about the future. Thats theory - and the efficient market theory is pretty much bunk, but its where you have to start to understand this. The problems with efficient markets aside it is still true that the best bet on future prices is the price today.
To explain why futures are not bets on the future - lets talk about a physical asset like gold (but Ill use made up numbers). Lets assume a unit of gold is $100 - and it takes $5 in security and other costs to store that gold every year. The futures price of one unit a year for now should be $105. If its not $105 then there is a potential for arbitrage profit. For example if the futures price was $110 we could buy 1 unit of gold, sell future contract 1 unit, spend $5 on storage, and then a year from now collect the $5 profit by delivering the gold against the contract.
This cash and carry arb is harder to explain in cash settled markets or with non physical assets but it does work the same way as the key thing to know is that arbitrage drives in professional arbs up until the point where the futures contract price is just the current price + carry cost. Carry cost includes (especially in non physical assets) other factors. The OP explains some of the math of this quite correctly - but I think the concept is easier to understand if we emphasis that the word "future" is very misleading.

Absolutely.

Oh - and to the extent that with  BTC in specific there is a big gap between futures and spot - at this time all that should tell you is that the market is really inefficient,  which is not a surprise to btc bulls or bears at this moment.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:21:36
Sort of - those terms describe the state of the arbitrage opportunity and that is where the idea of what the price in the future come in.  If you really had good reason to believe that the price of something in the future is say $50, but the current future contract is $100 the market is in contango and what should happen is futures prices should fall due to arbitrage.  
Backwardation is the opposite - where the futures price should rise.

Well - people can  buy BTC now - but I do think its hard to do for people new to it wanting to move large amounts of money safely so the arb is being slow to kick in
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:13:37
Totally reasonable question and really common misunderstanding.    Think of it this way.  Imagine someone you really trust told you secretly that the price of gold in a year would be $105.  Gold when you are told this is $50.  Well you could just buy gold and sell later.  You also could finance your ability to buy more gold today by selling futures contracts as long as you could get more than current spot + carry costs.  Now if it was only you that knew this then it would not move the market, but when pros with money know this what they do is sell the future and use those funds to buy the spot.  The more they do this the more the spot price increase and the future price decreases.  Eventually the price of the future and spot converge so that the future price is the spot plus carry.
Does that make sense?
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:51:34
Right now I dont think there are enough arbs that have in place the ability to buy or sell lots of BTC and futures at the same time so he difference is not really carry.
Also - using the word "carry cost" is a bit of an oversimplifications - the full pricing model for futures takes in a bunch of other factors but its easier to describe with the simple term when trying to make the point that its not so much a bet on the price at the contract date as people think it is.

This is a very important question - and one that should be asked of any new idea - unless its protected by patented IP - why are others not doing it.  
You can be 100% certian that google. apple, as well as every payment processor and bank has spent a lot of money looking at crypto.  The fact that they have done nothing after several years probably means their market research shows no consumer demand.  If there ever is demand, they will get in quickly and still be able to crush the entrenched players

Even if crypto transactions were free fast and easy for a currency to be used for commerce it has to be stable.  If you buy any crypto hoping the price will go up then you are also hoping that it will not be a good currency.
Imagine if the value of the dollar kept going up really fast.  Would you ever spend?  No - you would save and so would everyone else and the economy would collapse.  
Now imagine you run a business and your costs are in dollars.  How are you going to manage knowing if you take crypto knowing if you will be up or down tomorrow - if you can cover your costs or not.

Its not clear that cryto will not be treated the same way as gold for capital gains - which means it would be higher than 20% for long term

They are going to lose.  The law is clear and the US extends to law outside its own borders to any country or bank that wants to do business with the US.  We may not like it, but the law says financial institutions have to enforce know your customer rules and submit information to the IRS

Its pretty  easy.   they spy on everything their people do.   catch and send enough of them to hard labor in jail and it will not tske long to change behavior.   the WSJ article today said they asked the exchanges for all the bank details of thier customers.  so most existing customers will br known the government.  dont understtimate the power of their government

I was thinking - wonder if in part this is an effort to show the US that China is doing something re North Korea which has been reported to use mining as a source of revenue - and probably in some way related to China re trade?

in china its very possible - they control every single bit of traffic into their country - it would be very easy for them to identify any local transaction and match it to an individual - then send that person to jail, work him to death, and sell his organs,

So people like the idea of a deflationary currency?  Not much worse for an economy than deflation as it makes people defer spending and kills consumption.
