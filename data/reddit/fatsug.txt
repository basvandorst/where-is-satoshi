The first I did when I got interested in cryptocurrency a week ago was to invest  , the only thing I regret was not having more savings to invest.

Beginners need to be aware that you pay tax on your capital gains. That means if you have 30% tax on your gains you are essentially losing money if you sell before a dip and then buy in before it has dropped 20%. 
If you sell at 10k you need to wait until it has gone down to at least 8k or else you will have less coins when you are at 10k again.
In my country we have 30% tax, not sure about the rest of the world though.
So better just HODL unless you are expecting a long term crash.

I can't get verified on GDAX otherwise that would be an option.

How quickly can you withdraw BTC money to USD/EUR on coinbase? Imagine you have 1000 BTC and want to sell all of it into USD/EUR before a big dip, is that possible? They say my weekly limit is €15,000. 
Also, if one is investing monthly or weekly in BTC, LTC and ETH what would be the best platform to minimize fees? I am currently using Coinbase and the buy/sell fees is not very appetizing, but if one is hodling long term Coinbase might be the best option? I'm basing that on the fact that if one is hodling long term one doesn't need to transfer their money and thus making fees not a big problem. However, the fees when buying cryptos monthly/weekly on Coinbase is not very nice. So basically what would the best platform for hodling long term be in terms of minimizing fees?

I made a post yesterday about this. I quote myself
"January: You sense a rise and buy 1000$ worth of bitcoins.
February: Bitcoin has rised 100% since january but you sense a dip and sell your 2000$ worth of bitcoins.
You now have 1000 + profit = 1000 + 0.7*1000 (30% tax.) = 1700$ worth of bitcoins.
March: Let's suppose, as you say, that bitcoin has dropped 30% and you sense a rise so you buy with your 1700$.
April: Now bitcoin has rised 30% so you are back at the starting point with 1.3*1700 = 2210$
If we assume 30% tax includes the buy/sell fee then according to the
calculations you would need to be sure that Bitcoin is going to drop 20% in order to buy in:
1700*1,2 = 2040$ = 40$ profit
TL;DR: If you are going to sell before the dip and then buy when it rises, in order to not lose money doing this you have to be sure that bitcoin will drop at least 20% (assuming 30% tax on capital gains.) before you buy in."

I know at least one coin in the top 50 with zero fees, almost instant transactions and fully scalable. There are no advantages to bitcoin other than being the first mover. Normies will soon realize this and bitcoin will be long gone, sorry.

I have about 200-300$ left each month to do whatever I want with. I invest at the minimum 100$ in BTC every month and that's the only thing I am investing in atm. I am thinking about putting some into Ethereum or Litecoin too but might just go all in on BTC for the time being. I am hoping that 3-4 years from now I can sell my investment at 500k$ per coin and buy a house.
How much of your salary or savings do you invest in BTC or alt coins each month? Do you go all in on BTC or are you diversifying by investing parts of it in alt coins?

I feel dumb for not selling but I'm in this for the long term so I think I will just HODL.

Bitcoin has "crashed" every christmas holiday prior years, what we see happening now is expected if we look at prior years. What do you think?
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:06:10
Yes! And if you sell the dip has to be more than 20% before you buy in again in order to have the same $ worth of bitcoins when it is back up again. (assuming 30% tax on capital gains.).
