Agreed. I love this site for in-depth trader analysis of bitcoin and crypto it's great. But is there are place where you can see side by side stats for all altcoins?

Recently I've been noticing plenty of excellent sites for comparing bitcoin &amp; cryptocurrency prices, statistics, and positions. These are the places I prefer most​​​​: 
1. **coinkapp [crypto price list]( has excellent information, news, &amp; social statistics for each coin. What i like most about coinkapp is that it clearly indicates **"Bitcoin has been  for 10 years and 1 month"** so your family and friends directly see how strong btc is as** long term asset-class** for storing value (and gaining value too!). The good thing about the charts for each coin is that they go all the way to 1 year and therefore it's easier to see how so many altcoins rise fast and then fall off in value compared to bitcoin. And coinkapp took off bitcnect as soon as experts like Andreas Antonop started advising people to do so.
2.  **Coingecko** - stands as the nearest rival to coinmarketcap crypto price website as it gets over **80M visits per month**. From what I know, the rank of all crypto coins are **very honest** (no scheme coins are included). You can't go wrong by recommending coingecko to a beginner family member. It's easy to read, understand, and is used by many people in the community. 
3. **[Coinmarketcap]( - i include this altcoin prices website here as  because there are still many people that use it. However do be aware that I've seen many "coins" listed that should not even be considered as "cryptocurrencies". It would be a funny to think that people even considered comparing such coins to bitcoin. All the same - keep in mind that **coinmarketcap is where most people go to get their crypto prices** (tho less so in recent times because so many good alternatives exist).
4. **Livecoinwatch** - a similar enough site as coinmarketcap, however i feel that **rankings are more accurate** and i just love the easy-to-read UI &amp; website theme. Very popular comparison tools include the "dominance ratios" (to compare all crypto coin ranks to bitcoin by market cap). I also like the feature to remove korean exchanges in the volumes. Another cool features is that prices auto-update. Though i'm not sure how realisitc/supportive the website operators are of bitcoin's long term investment value.
5. **Cryptocompare** - the second most serious (and visited) crypto price comparison site to be built after coinmarketcap - they get 150 million views per month. They have been around for some time, and understandably have **a big community following**. I really like how all **coins are priced in BTC** (just further show how bitcoin is the reserve currency of the crypto economy!) rather than USD as most other market cap sites do. 
6. **Athcoinindex** - as others have mentioned here, this place is great to **compare the max price of all coins** and see that bitcoin (once again) triumphs. **BTC has never been surpassed** which is prettty reassuring from an invetment perspective. 
7. **Coincap** (not the same as coinkapp.com) - another popular crytocurrency price website. Easy to get a quick overview of all prices. **Data auto updates frequently**. I've heard that information is taken from coinmarketcap's public API, so not sure if it can be totally trusted (we've been hearing that the former's price data is not 100% honest/accurate at times)  
8. Browse through the **[crypto price sites]( on alternativeto**.  I've come to know lots of new services thanks to the range of alternatives listed there. 
9. **Moonstats** -  a simple, easily readable comparison of all cryptocurrency prices and market caps. Pretty trendy name also! The website operators are active on social media and **contribute to the bitcoin community** in many ways.  
10. **Cryptowatch** - not so beginner friendly, but if you're a day-trader (or night trader mostly) you will like the **dark background** as it's soft on the eyes. I find it harder to quickly compare all the altcoins to bitcoin though.  
11. **Coinliker** - also offers that simple listing of cryptocoins by market cap. There could be more statistics offered here, but i guess the operators choose to keep it simple. A nice **backup** website to use all the same.
12. **Onchainfx** -  this place gets 4 million views per month from the crypto community. I find that it works nicely on **mobile devices**. Prices are taken form exchanges' public api data** which makes them easier to trust.
13. **TradingView** - one of the world's best sites for in-depth user generated analysis of market signals and stats. I really like the comments and discussions here. Similar to coinkapp, you'll read a lot of informative human-written content here. A good place for your family to get further interested in pro trading analysis. 
** EDIT: Some more excellent bitcoin &amp; crypto price statistics websites mentioned here:
- **Coinalyze**
- **Coinlib**

AFAIK it has it's own data source. Correct me if I'm wrong tho.

I've looked up Electrum and many reviews place it as the best desktop wallet for bitcoin. It looks quite simple to use (kinda similar to the user friendly interface of Multibit). 
Why do you prefer it over... say Armory ?
@_date: 2017-09-25 12:51:06


So this would be the safest option for storing bitcoin? Which one do you recommend?
I'm ok with paying the extra money for added security it's worth it :) 
@_date: 2017-09-25 13:03:18
Thanks, I have heard of it but it was not around back 3 years ago. Why do you like Breadwallet more than other alternative mobile wallets ? Do you use any more wallets - say desktop or hardware ? I'm curious what advantages each type has.
@_date: 2017-09-25 12:57:15
What exactly is QT &amp; why do you like using it over other wallets? 
I think I remember using it in 2013 but now in 2017, none of the guides have it as a bitcoin wallet recommendation. What happened? 
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:46:43


Nicely said. This is very true about investing altcoins! And, they also say that lottery is a "tax on stupidity"... so 
@_date: 2017-09-25 12:52:22
Ok, this is really useful information. I've been reading that desktop wallets are safe so long as you use a trusted app. But you make a point that the PC also needs to be "trusted" and virus-free.

It's in the top left corner for bitcoin --&gt; [see here]( There's a rank position tracker on coinkapp that tracks where each cryptocurrency was on a given day. bitcoin has been the only top coin for &gt; 10 years. Now that's impressive
@_date: 2017-09-25 12:58:54
So Jaxx is an online wallet right? I'm guessing it's not the safest bitcoin wallet if you are deciding to switch to a hardware alternative? 
What would you prefer using one over the other for? 
@_date: 2017-09-25 09:43:35
Agree! It is one of the worlds most beautiful.
@_date: 2017-09-25 12:59:41
Thanks, I've never heard of Samurai wallet. What type of storage is this and is it trustworthy? Why do you like it over the alternatives?
@_date: 2017-09-25 12:48:45
Thanks for the advice, I'm seriously considering using a hardware wallet as my main storage system. 
What do you prefer about Trezor, say over the Ledger?
Which hardware wallet is best for easily making fast transactions, like you would on a mobile equivalent? 
@_date: 2017-09-25 13:00:43


It looks like many comments here recommend both these as the best hardware wallets for storing bitcoin safely. Out of the Trezor and Ledger, which one would you prefer and why?
