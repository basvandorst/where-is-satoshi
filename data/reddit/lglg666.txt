Always have people creating drama to try to slow down or even kill off bitcoin but the eventual result is always the same, the king will always come back fighting.

After they suppressed the bitcoin price down into the abyss to shake off all the weak hands then they will pump up to enrich themselves and their partners. Then bitcoin will go mainstream for sure, while again the common men/women on the streets will be priced out.
