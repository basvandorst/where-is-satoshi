You did it right the first time...If he doesnt respond, just call his new office ...look him up on linkedin.... and ask for him there

Dont forget guys... We get our BCH tomorrow. Right @_date: 2018-02-22 16:20:50
Easy to see that only cares about himself/his own interests. I was trying to advocate for him and give him the benefit of the doubt, but it's been far too long.

, one thing that may help is updating the phone message  - it says withdrawals are halted. maybe that can help with some of the confusion

thank u for the update, did not know that. saw one place say that BCH was supposed to be added by December and then January but my account doesn't show that. appreciate the response and will redact my previous comments.
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:37:35
Thanks. Updating everyone about the timeline for BCH would be a start. I've only got 100 or so coming my way, so there are plenty of tickets more important than mine.

ROFL...i wonder who. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:25:46
So we can keep you accountable, when will the BCH be ready? You've severely missed a couple of deadlines. From the outside looking in, it appears you are stalling until people forget or quit trying to recover their funds.

ILYA, hellooooooooo buddy.......back in hiding?

"taking" (as in CURRENTLY taking) is inaccurate; try to make an account - it won't let you. yes, it appears per their email that they had to take a good portion of everyone's balance to offset fraud. but it doesn't seem that they are currently operating a "deposit only" platform.

are you working through the ticket list alone? My ticket from November is unresolved. November!!!! 
@_date: 2018-02-15 13:31:33
I don't want preferential treatment or a biased handling of my ticket. It's the one from November. If you have multiple tickets from November, that's pretty sad. I went back and checked my support ticket and then created a new one, and based on the  assigned to each ticket and the dates they were created, you are averaging about 2 tickets per day. I'm sure that's slowing, too. If you can't handle 2 tickets per day, then we are all in for a rude awakening (never getting our BCH).

You must be using 'shortly' in relation to the age of earth....most of us consider 'shortly' to mean hours...maybe a day or so. You've said shortly numerous times for the past 6 months. Are you just a bad person?
