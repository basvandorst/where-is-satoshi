Well, you could have said the same about gold, when gold started to become valuable. Gold became valueable and used a storage of value, because It doesn't corrode, so it doesn't lose value over time, was easily transportable and easy to be formed in, as an example, gold bars. Gold has to be "mined" too to get u some gold without paying for it directly. Now Gold is a good store of value, but so can be a CryptoCoin with a good blockchain. And cryptos are very similar to gold, just digital.
Now comparing Currencies with Crypto is a different thing. USD or EUR are surely not backed by Gold anymore, especially if you look at the printing rates the last years. This means it could be easily manipulated, especially now that everything is becoming digital. The Currency became digital too, but without any background value. The $ or € amount in ur bank isn't backed by anything, it's just a number. Now with cryptos, they are digital too, but with a solid legit digital technology. its just as any other currency, just a number, but backed by a technology(blockchain) that can't be manipulated or falsified. It also matters which Crypto you pick, because not every (coin) has a solid technology or even team behind it.
Now wouldn't it be beautiful if everyone had a currency that can't be manipulated, and you don't have to worry if your money is still the same value next year? With this I mean a Crypto being used as a day to day currency just as $ or € or any other currency.

I feel you man, 20k is a lot. I "luckily" lost only 3k in comparison, but what I hate the most is that some foreign criminal goverment system (Murica) took my investment out of thin air.
