I remember watching a Looney Tunes cartoon like this when I was growing up. edit: [found it](

That was me.  I spent 75% of that $1000 within a year, had like $250 worth left.  
Sold the remaining coins in late 2013 at around $1200/btc for something like $22,000.  I think I did pretty well, all told.

Nah, all gone.  Spent it on furniture for my apartment and uh, the ability to not work a 9-5 for a while.

Don't care.

Meh, or pull out at the bottom right before it rises back up.

But why do people want gold jewelry?  More or less, because it looks shiny.  Therefore people say "ok, this is useful way of tracking wealth".  In the same way, because Bitcoins are a useful way of tracking wealth, people value it. 
Yes, there is a risk of the BTC economy collapsing.  There is always risk, in everything.

I feel like a moron.  I bought $1000 worth at $12.50 / BTC thinking it was a great investment.  Gunna hang in there and not sell though.

That typo appears more than once.  Glad someone else noticed it too.

If this is your logic (i.e. more people finding out about it --&gt; higher value), why did it crash from $33 down to $3 back in 2011?  What makes this rally different?

Bought $1000-worth in mid-2011, at $12/btc.  The price immediately crashed, eventually down to $3.  I've spent 2/3 of it since then.  Shouldn't've spent it! 
At least I'm not [this guy](  The dude literally spent a million dollars on a pizza.

That's a massive oversimplification but generally the right idea.   The "gold rush" of mining has passed us by though; at this point you'll spend way more on electricity running the computer than the value you'll mine up- unless you're exceptionally lucky.
