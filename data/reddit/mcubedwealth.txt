If you live in Toronto Canada There's a comic book store called Hairy tarantula and the owner of the store does accept Bitcoin but you have to purchase at least $500 worth of merchandise in order for him to accept it.

Dude with any publicly traded resource whales try to corner it by using whatever tactics work regardless of the effects on the broader marketplace, thats how they can achieve excess profits and gains, thats what makes then whales, consequently thats why capitalism doesn't work.  The only true equitable system will be 'Universalism' which is what they have in sci-fi shows like Star Trek where the entire planet pools their resources towards a common goal like Space Exploration.  I dont think a Decentralized Consensus system will correct capitalism's flaws but cuttimg ties with an infinite supplable currency system is definitely a turn for the better.

Well I would rate exchanges based on their volumes, offerings, and analytics and since Coinbase is the worst for all those 3 criteria I think that assessment of them is just shit paid for corp advertising.

Most of the money out of equities is going to go into what it usually does precious metals but at much smaller portfolio allocations, with more money flowing into crypto cuz of its speculative nature and see a really huge pump and dump the way to get recover their equity losses so cryptos trading at 100X their market values then correcting within a 3 month period

Yeah what a shock bunch of billionaires are calling Bitcoin a bubble when it's at 20K creating the necessary foot to bring it down 6k and then all the sudden link they're interested in buying it almost seems as though this is part of a pump and dump strategy  of some kind....?

Here's the best explanation Wealth Managers missed out on BTC for their clients, when BTC hit 20K whales United to get it to a desire price point of 1K so they could buy 1,000 Btc per client in their portfolios so it.will tank until that price and then  blow up again to 40k then sell of those 5 k and pump back to 80k it will do this over and over as NO asset market is fair or equitable, if they were wed all be well off, just HODL and have the funds ready to buy 5 or 10 btc at 1k per like I did in 2014 when it went from 1200 down to 300 and I was being advised to not buy at 300 by investment professional that I consult with they said I was throwing away my.money at $300 USD per BTC
