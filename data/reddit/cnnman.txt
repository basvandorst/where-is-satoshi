I had an unconfirmed transaction last weekend. Took 3.5 days then transaction was cancelled and BTC was showing again in my wallet. Fees too low. I've read it can take up to 2 weeks for cancellation but not seen actual evidence.
Nothing you can do tho - just wait. For me transaction was not urgent so gonna sit it out until wallet implements SegWit / fee customisation before trying again.

Was from a Bread Wallet wallet.  Others may confirm but I don't think the anything actually leaves your wallet...until it actually leaves your wallet. Right?

Ahhh. Now I finally understand. Thanks for taking the time to explain. I'll go and research this further.

Got a new address each time - I read that was more secure.

I would if I could shift my BTC with reasonable fees - but out of interest why?

Did you even read the post?
I've been reading this sub daily for a few months, this is my first post. I've seen plenty of comments about fees, but I have never seen mention of such a wild fluctuation of fees over a short period of time i.e. 1 hour. Similarly, I've never seen info about BreadWallet's two state fee settings and if there are plans to change this in the future.
I also wondered if others might find my summary of BreadWallet's Regular/Economy fee settings useful as I couldn't find much out there.
So I asked what I think is a valid set of questions.
But hey - thanks for the welcome...

Thanks, good to know. I am in no real rush to make the transfer other than peace of mind of having my BTC stored on my Ledger.
Personally I am happy to wait a bit to see if fees drop slightly, or BreadWallet updates the fee customisation settings, or SegWit implementation causes fees to drop.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:30:05
Yeah that's pretty much my conclusion too.
As BreadWallet is the only wallet I've used, I am trying to understand whether all wallets generate the tx fees in the same way. I get that BTC tx fees are high in general right now - but this seems to be exacerbated by BreadWallet's limited control settings maybe?
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:31:53
...and were fees OK, or were they high and you just took the hit? Did you just go with Regular setting?

Thought long and hard about this. Bought Bitcoin for my (4 x teenage) kids this Xmas. Was originally going to give them paper wallets but figured it was a a step too far / complicated / security issues. 
Instead I'm gonna store their BTC on MY Ledger. I will suggest they HODL but if they want to cash out - well I'll give them the cash value at that point and I'll keep the BTC.
(Oh and for the record the BTC I bought for them last weekend  is already +25% and still 10 days till Xmas ��)

My test transaction was sent Saturday morning and finally got rejected tonight, so approx 3.5 days. I did read it could take up to 2 weeks but detail was surprisingly sketchy.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:20:26
Excellent - thanks for the reply. I look forward to checking out these improvements in future releases.

Yeah I have read that a few times and wondered if that applied. So - does that mean if for example I purchased some BTC via Coinabase for 20 successive weeks and then transferred to BreadWallet each time, that would make 20x inputs when I come to transfer the entire amount to my Ledger?

Same happened to me - transaction sent on Saturday morning with low fee (BreadWallet Economy). Remained unconfirmed until earlier tonight when it was finally rejected, so approx 3.5 days.
I did read that it could take up to 2 weeks but I couldn't find any details to verify that information, and it's not clear to me what causes the tx to finally be cancelled.

I think this is a great thread and fully agree that it is important to encourage the use of BTC as payment for goods/services where possible and appropriate.
We launched [Code Angel]( (Learn to code 12 cool Python games) 3 weeks ago.
So, this weekend we are going to trial accepting BTC as payment.
Unfortunately as we are in the UK and use Stripe, we have not been able to integrate BTC payments into our online shop, but if anyone is interested [just contact us directly](
