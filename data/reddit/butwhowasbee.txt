I totally understand that, but I would prefer a world where we don't have to void bad contracts instead of a world where we do. Because of that, I am trying to spread awareness of this issue.

If they violate their terms and conditions, why should I have to uphold my agreement not to sue them? The whole concept of forced arbitration makes no sense. When companies use forced arbitration like this it is a total double standard. They can violate their agreement however they want, and then have the audacity to tell you that you can't sue because the agreement says so (even though they violated the agreement). 
edit: You added some stuff to your post, so I will respond to your new questions:


I have no problem with arbitration. I have a problem with a company violating the agreement and then saying you can't sue them because the agreement says so even though they violated it.


That's fine, and in the meantime I think forced arbitration is a despicable practice that is taking advantage of the vast majority of the population who doesn't understand what arbitration even is. I am trying to raise awareness and encourage people to boycott these services.
