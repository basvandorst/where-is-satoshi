I couldn't be more excited about the future of bitcoin.  Right now I'm geeking out over everything lightning.  In a couple of weeks I get to set up my first lightning node and am really looking forward to it.

So what's the very best hardware wallet available right now for somebody interested in long term HODLing/not needing regular access to funds?
@_date: 2018-11-30 23:57:39
10 coins!  Living the dream, brother.  Super happy for you, and only hope that someday I'll find myself being able to say the same.
@_date: 2019-01-03 19:17:00
Would that be the Trezor One or Model T?
@_date: 2019-01-02 15:57:32
Which address-watching app do you use?  I've been looking for a good one.
Also, how do you know he sold it?  Perhaps he wanted to move it around to a more conspicuous wallet?
@_date: 2019-01-03 19:26:37
Nice.  Personally I've got no need for altcoin storage, just wanting something long term reliable and absolutely safe for Bitcoin.  Thanks for the suggestion!
@_date: 2019-01-02 16:02:23
Would love to hear your thoughts on keyword protection.  That's an aspect of security that always feels vulnerable to me.
@_date: 2018-12-17 18:52:04
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-12-05 03:09:39
Oh I know cryptojacking is very real, and always a good thing to point out.  I think the biggest criticism is that they have quite a bit of personal information, so there is a huge privacy risk.  Are they selling it?  I don't think so, but it's a risk.  They say withdrawals will be enabled by the end of the year, but until we see it I think it's reasonable to be skeptical.  
Having said all of that, I'm a lolli user. ;)
@_date: 2018-12-03 18:24:42
That laugh at the end is so good 
@_date: 2018-12-13 17:06:02
And remember, you don't have to wait until January 3rd to pull your BTC off the exchanges.  Use the time between now and then to read up on proper storage and security.  
Not your keys, not your coins!
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:32:44
Every time we dip I tell myself, "just wait...it's going lower, just wait."  
And then 5 minutes later I tell myself, "but they're only asking for $3,300 for a bitcoin.  Let's just grab $50 here, $100 there..."
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:54:02
Yeah, it's like... 5.25 inches at most
@_date: 2018-12-01 17:50:13
Well, obviously...
@_date: 2018-12-06 23:50:14
Woahhhhh what!  Thank you u/charlespax and u/Zodiac1 !  I'm setting up a Casa node around Christmas time, can't wait to have something to actually test a send/receive with.  This is awesome!
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:35:27
This is so great, thank you for your hard work!
@_date: 2018-12-14 13:48:24
Very, very good book.  I bought about 15 copies of it yesterday and am giving it to friends and family for Christmas (alongside their normal gifts).
@_date: 2018-12-06 13:42:58
I haven't been able to find a grocery partner for BTC, it's one of the areas I've been wanting to figure out.  Is there a chain you go to that accepts?
@_date: 2018-12-17 23:15:47
This is awesome, but not sure what a lottery miner is?  Can't wait to get myself up running a lightning node!
@_date: 2018-12-05 02:54:52
First I've seen this.  Don't think it's true.  Do you have a source?
@_date: 2018-12-11 15:26:41
Such an absolute genius.  Thank you for posting, I wasn't aware of this interview.
@_date: 2018-12-17 23:01:50
That absolutely boggles my mind.  I count by the satoshi and have been working very hard to add them as I can.  Looking at those transactions is so beautiful. :)
I wonder where someone goes to purchase a couple hundred bitcoin each day.
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:18:33
That's fantastic.  We have a lot of little shops here, I should try to have a similar conversation.  I'm really striving for the days when I can get off fiat entirely, but there are still a good number of huge problem areas.  All in good time, I suppose.
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:23:58
I'll have what he's having!
@_date: 2018-12-02 02:07:21
He's calling 225k for 2022, right? 
@_date: 2018-12-17 18:44:35
That'd function perfectly, but I actually want to put the app on my son's phone.  I'm trying to teach him about bitcoin and thought an app with ease of use might be the best way for him to get the hang of it (and keeping it in cold storage prevents spending until I can mediate it a bit, hah).
@_date: 2018-12-11 01:59:56
Plural!? Well, aren't you posh!
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:52:36
It's bound to work!  Thank you for giving us all a monumental moon shot.
@_date: 2018-12-18 04:27:07
Welcome to the club, bud!  Very happy for you.
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:13:18
That was my dilemma too, but just hitting phone age for this Christmas.  Without the phone I thought it'd be a bit too disconnected to feel like it is *his*.  
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:21:50
Nope, that's 
@_date: 2018-12-14 03:05:45
I've bet against him big time on this one.  It doesn't concern me at all, but it also doesn't give me any warm fuzzies when I think about it.
@_date: 2018-12-04 21:36:14
This is definitely on the nose, lol.
It's sooooo great when you can use your BTC directly though!  We'll get there soon enough.
@_date: 2018-12-05 06:36:15
@_date: 2018-12-13 23:17:30
If that were true he could drop a billion on it and add to his legacy.
@_date: 2018-12-14 03:50:00
I'm 100% balls
^^^^0% ^^^^brains
@_date: 2018-12-18 23:26:51
This would be fun to try.  Wonder what miner would be a good one to grab as a one-off machine to put to work?
@_date: 2018-12-06 23:36:35
Woah, that's a neat feature
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:13:49
Heck yeah, get your coins off the exchanges
@_date: 2018-12-01 15:45:59


I don't agree with that assertion.
@_date: 2018-12-20 19:45:59
Shoot, I wish my goal was even set at 10 but I just don't think it realistic despite my greatest efforts.  Agreed, though.  Do what you can now as over the years it's only going to be harder and harder.
@_date: 2018-12-21 18:57:50


That's definitely a good sign.  
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:54:19
Dude this is a monumental accomplishment!  The best part is, you've now earned your stripes in a rough bear market.  In a few years, when everybody tells you how lucky you were you will be able to enjoy the hardiest of laughs.
@_date: 2018-12-12 19:11:33
I will not heed this advice. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 22:49:14
Never watched the movie, but it's at the top of my to-do list now. Looks pretty good!
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:28:16
I quite like him, but he is kind of silly sometimes
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:58:29
$4,035?  Now that sounds like a dream!
@_date: 2018-12-06 02:52:14
Segwit is life!
@_date: 2018-12-18 22:13:07
Absolutely love this podcast ... looking forward to listening to this one!
@_date: 2018-12-11 13:43:49
Agreed.  To the point that I can't imagine that this is even a campaign.  It's surprising to me that so many coins are kept on the exchange.
@_date: 2018-12-17 18:18:47
Is there an app that would let you view a few bitcoin addresses only?  I want to keep bitcoin in cold storage, but would like to be able to track incoming/outgoing on the phone for reference.
@_date: 2018-12-08 18:14:48
Thank you!!
@_date: 2018-12-07 13:07:29
That's incredible, thank you so much!
@_date: 2018-12-22 01:29:01
This is good advice.
@_date: 2018-12-07 04:34:22
I wish I was holding a lot more! :)
Thanks for the tips!
@_date: 2018-12-04 20:28:16
Maybe.  Szabo is a damn genius either way.
@_date: 2018-12-05 04:45:37
I'm both very happy for you and very jealous at the same time. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 19:54:17
Every poignant comment does not need to end with "let that sink in."
