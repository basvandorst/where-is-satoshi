Legal, yes.  Google aren't the police. Allowed, no.  Your app will be pulled eventually if you try it.
Whether you could buy bitcoin as an 'in-game currency' then somehow transfer them out.. I'm not sure whether google would take kindly to that interpretation either.
**Paid and Free Apps**
**App purchases:** Developers charging for apps and downloads from Google Play must do so by using Google Play's payment system.
**In-app purchases:** Developers offering virtual goods or currencies within a game downloaded from Google Play must use Google Play's in-app billing service as the method of payment.

It's normally 20% here too but the government decided to guarantee small deposits by offering to pay the banks the difference if the house price tanks.  There are also local lenders who will do it, but they get no government help

How is it a cold wallet if it has a connection to the network at all.  It should be impossible to drain it.

Since when is an easily photoshopped picture of a driving license proof of identity?  Or a 'utility bill'?
It's all about box ticking, not proving anything.

My justification for a /27 was 'I have a bunch of machines'.  
It's never been hard to get them - I know several people on my ISP with /24s.  Of course the ISP also does ipv6, which reduces the need for more somewhat (especially now they've run out).
