I'm turning superstitious at this point. I bought some alts on Sunday with a stop-limit in case things dipped. Then I finally figure "screw it, it's Tuesday" and moved everything into their wallets. Hours later... Boom!
However, now that BTC has dropped I kinda feel that I don't need to look at the charts every 5 minutes wondering what it's going to do.
I'm not gonna play the Tether game because I seem to mostly make crap decisions. I guess I'll just hold everything through this and see what happens on the weekly rather than focus on the hourly. I haven't invested what I can't afford and I'm in this for the long-game.
I guess my biggest fear is that these "normal" dips make people leave the Crypto Market. Maybe better education/awareness of Crypto can prepare young investors what to expect. But that's a whole new thread.

I hope we don't keep bouncing between 11,100 and 11,500 all day. I'm on edge as it is...

So, I managed to ween myself off checking Crypto prices 100 times a day to the point where I stopped checking every day. The last time I looked was Monday morning...
I'll just pretend I never looked and go about my business again...

The enormous sell walls on GDAX(USD) at 11,500 have lowered significantly in the last few hours. Still high though, but perhaps a sign of things to come. That or wishful thinking :)

I haven't invested a single penny into Crypto that I can't afford to lose

Out of curiosity, what would be the reasoning behind the 11500 sell wall on GDAX (USD)? Would the sellers be wanting to keep the price down until the banks open again on Monday and the cash comes back into the market again? Or is it just a trigger for another big dip? I've no idea, but figured you guys could shed some light on it for me :)

Yeah, I thought OTC was the solution for scenarios like this one

My TA looks like a toddler has been drawing on my living room wall with crayon for the best part of an hour.

Day trading fascinates me, and if I didn't already have a full-time job then I'd love to pour over charts and "gamble" all day. But it takes a lot out of you. Also, I prefer the lower stress levels you get from HODLing.

I feel like the events of the past 24 hours have lead to some knee-jerk reactions leading to the market cap taking a dive. And I can't blame people because everyone has their own reasons to HODL/Sell/Buy more. But if you take a step back and look at these things:
* Gox Whale = The sale of assets over time will help remove some of those spike sales we see (eventually)
* SEC + CFTC = Should help bring confidence to new investors wanting to enter Crypto
* Coinbase Index = Help/incentivise investors enter Crypto space
* Binance = Problem addressed and resolution scheduled
I can truly see it leading to a stronger foundation for Crypto over the next few years. And I think anyone still able to HODL who bought at the ATH will make decent profits over time.

It's kinda like being in the trenches right now

Yes, my portfolio is down by 24%. But I'm not phased by this weeks "news" and I see this as a buying opportunity to invest in the future. So I just dropped another $1k on BTC.
I could have tried to time the bottom, but I suck at it. Plus BTC at $8700 seemed like a decent price. I'd rather jump in a little early than a little late.

Honestly, it's a flip of a coin. I could probably BS a case for a move either way using crappy TA. But realistically, I would simply buy in now and set yourself a stop-limit at about a 4% loss in case it does plummet.
Not advice, just an opinion from an old fool.

I hope this Gox guy sells the rest using an OTC service. He's been so irresponsible dumping on an exchange. I'm hoping the hate in this weeks media has made him think twice...

The wrath of the wife would be worse than the bankruptcy itself, lol
