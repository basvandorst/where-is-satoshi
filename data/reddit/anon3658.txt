@_date: 2015-04-02 09:54:54
i saw that, impressive
@_date: 2015-04-01 15:53:02
don't convert, keep it in btc

it would be great if everything was truly decentralized and devs pitched in ad hoc. but reality is that people have bills to pay and development would be slow that way - look at emerging bitcoin apps as examples. especially with bitcoin core being relatively fragile in the beginning, it pays to have devs devoted to this full time.
so then, if TBF is dissolved, who's going to pay the devs? (seriously)

deep down you know he already has mixed feelings about it.
@_date: 2015-04-11 09:44:21
wait, i know a phone number OP can call to de-escalate this
@_date: 2015-04-03 18:13:53
not if you backed up your seed: depending on which wallet you used, it's just a bunch of words. you could write them on a piece of paper at home. if phone is lost, get a new one, install wallet, enter seed, recover funds.

most interesting sub you'll ever find
@_date: 2015-04-09 20:58:39
clearly a wizard

block size scaling, lightning network, sidechains - a few big changes that may become difficult to implement once the training wheels are taken off.
gavin, peiter, etc. haven't harmed bitcoin thus far, i think it's worth keeping them on the payroll until core is v1.0.
fix TBF but keep paying devs for as long as possible.

damn, a few of you are putting your money where your mouths are...

@_date: 2015-03-30 10:42:29


same. i'm reminded of the tv show 'the weakest link' where the contestants shout 'bank' to save their earnings.
@_date: 2015-03-20 10:44:50

@_date: 2015-02-07 08:15:20
start a pos coin, wait 6 years and see if it's still going

Bill: That’s the thing though: there’s a lot of thinking been done on this subject – some of it by me. And the more that you are in charge of the world, the less well the world will work.
@_date: 2015-03-27 12:24:55
bitcoin will process payments to sanctioned countries and nobody can stop it
@_date: 2015-02-26 12:51:49
