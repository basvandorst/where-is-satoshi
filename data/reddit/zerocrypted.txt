I firstly found out about it in 2013. Purchased it under $150 and put it in a safe place. I only purchased 3 as I liked the idea. 
Then I started spending it and testing the technology. Bought more a few months later. Then got caught up with the work and forgot about it. 
Found those a few months back and was able to sold for a nice amount of cash that allowed me to support myself for a while. 
Now, I'd like to help more people understand it and increase adoption. It's so annoying to use paper money.

It means Bitcoin is probably the safest cryptocurrency to stay into a market like this.
We'll probably see a 70% domination before another alt boom.

Interesting idea, I love it!
It would be nice to see a ''Hall of Fame''.

He probably have a shit ton of it. 
And wants to sell at a higher price

I love pineapple pizza too, but let's face it - there are a lot of haters.

Sure, well shall I send like 10kg of Venezuelan Bolivar?

Indeed, Bitcoin can do this - but besides it there will be other useful cryptocurrencies such as ETH, XMR and many more. 
Same as a banking system works with USD, EUR, GBP - BTC will work with other cryptocurrencies with a lower value and adoption.

Was about time :)

Why are you comparing Bitcoin with a bubble?

I still remember when he was called the Bitcoin Jesus. 
Now, he's more hated than Pineapple Pizza.

Why don't you use OTC services? Like LocalBitcoins, Huobi,etc.
@_date: 2018-09-13 09:24:53
Sounds good. 
Hopefully they will be more serious than the past miners and will create some serious competition for Bitmain.

Who knows. 
Last time people entered because of the Ethereum ICOs mania. Now, we need another 'fuel'. Something better though. 
I'm thinking already established companies launching ICOs as a way to sell 5-10% of their worth - instead of finding one big investor. 
Hopefully before that, we will see some clear regulations, an increased adoption and smart ways to protect against scammers. This is what crypto is missing right now, not investors.

Even without a dick he's still a dick.

Apple's phones are like that shinny nice designed ICO that you want to invest. 
It may look good, but it will cost you a lot of money and in time the value will go to almost $0.

Probably not the best investment you can do. Especially with these times. 
You may buy some to understand the field better, see how Bitcoin works, buy something with it - but $20,000 is a pretty big amount and it could be years until Bitcoin will reach a higher price. 
Are you willing to take this risk? 
@_date: 2018-09-14 11:28:14
I wouldn't waste my BTC for something so meaningless. 
Better keep it until we'd be able to buy literally everything with it. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 11:43:33
Woah, $193M. Someone's preparing for something.
@_date: 2018-09-13 09:28:22
Indeed, they do this for attention. And to 'scare' the people. Last year when Bitcoin was going crazy over $1,000 - no website was writing about it. As soon as it was over $4,000 or so - everyone wanted a part of it. 
So, yea - now they say the Bitcoin died and in a few months you will see a headline with "Bitcoin - A phoenix rising from its ashes".
It's how paid journalism work.

not if he keeps his bitcoin private
@_date: 2018-11-08 12:44:42
you might say they have a Bitcoin Interest.
