Right now, in order for you to exchange fiat to Bitcoin, you need to trust someone - Mt. Gox, BitStamp, LocalBitcoins, etc.
Bitcoin protocol allows you to transfer bitcoins to people without a central point - no bank or Paypal.
If there were a way to convert fiat to Bitcoin in a decentralized (trust no one) fashion, that would be awesome.

I read your comment before watching the video.  I didn't think the video was that bad.  
These will be really fun videos to watch in ten years.  Skepticism and interest by regulators is really a good thing, if you are interested in long-term widespread usage and higher valuations.  
(yes, I know that statement alone earns me downvotes from the anarchist crowd.  But you don't win the hearts and minds of the people by ramming something foreign down their throats.  You ease it in there among skepticism and regulation, until they see the utility.  Then you've won.)

The banking cartel are some of the most powerful men in the world.  He has basically produced something that could be retroactively determined to be illegal, and he could be imprisoned for life or assassinated.
Not to mention, if you are super rich, your life and your children tend to be in danger (see Charles Lindbergh).

How different is it if you pay hitmen, or if you join a pool of people who combine funds to pay a hitman?  
Or say you pool your funds, and pay an organization, who disperses the funds to a hit organization, who carries out the killing.
Or say it's not even that direct - say the funds are pulled from your paycheck, and routed to an organization headquarters, who mixes it with other funds, to fund some giant killing organization, to carry out hits?
Or say you pay your taxes, and they are used to fund the largest military which kills people without trial.

You've positioned me to end the debate through the application of [Godwin's Law](  
Your issue with Step 4 seems to be that National Governments executing people without trial is somehow different (more ethical?) than a crime organization doing the same thing.  Yet we have seen numerous individuals in high positions of National Governments tried for and convicted of war crimes of this nature.  So apparently the world courts disagree with you.  (Apply [Godwin's Law here](
None of the three points about voluntary, intent, and size of organization seem to change the fact of whether a hitman is being hired.  
Further, each paid worker signs a W-4, which gives the worker the option to eliminate all federal withholdings, so it's not involuntary.
Intent is a simple chain:  people pay taxes intending to fund their government, almost always understanding that it will fund the military.  The military (or its leadership) consistently intends to kill without trial, and this is no secret to most every informed tax payer.
Size of the organization is no excuse, and actually works against your argument, if you consider how the US Government pursues criminals.  The US Government consistently pursues each large criminal organization with more resource than the average one-person or small criminal entity.
I don't consider myself a master-debater, but this has been fun.

Picture yourself standing in a large room full of buyers and sellers of bitcoins.  The sellers are yelling out "I'm asking $167.50" (or some other price).  The buyers are yelling out "I'm bidding $164.25" (or whatever).
When a bidder likes an asking price (or vice versa), they get together and execute a transaction.  This determines the "last transaction price".
If you are wanting to sell your bitcoins *now*, you would listen to all the bids, and first go to the highest bid, and sell as many as you could.  Then to the second highest, and so on.  As you do that, each "last transaction" goes for a lower price, since the 3rd highest is lower than the 2nd highest, which is lower than the highest.  Likewise if you are trying to ~~sell~~ buy *now* - you'd buy the cheapest first, then the second cheapest, and so on, driving the "last transaction price" upward.
These *now* transactions are called "market orders".

Why do you think they'd dump all the bitcoins all at once?  That would be hurting themselves.
A counter argument is that all of the people whose bitcoins were seized all need to go buy replacement coins to do their transactions.  So Bitcoin is undervalued by approximately an equal amount.  Take that into consideration, and we are where we are.

The private key is simply 256 bits. It's not outrageously long. It can be stored as a string of 256 zeros and ones, dots and dashes, marks on a bedpost.

There's a good argument to be made that if you poll everyone, you want to do the opposite of popular opinion.  And since no one here really knows anything more than you do, it's silly to ask this question.
Not to mention, questions like it were asked all day yesterday, so browsing some of yesterday's questions or using search will give you some answers.
But, to not be a total ass, I'll give you an answer that has about as much credibility as anyone else on here.  The long-term holders do not thing the price is high and do not thing the media attention is particularly high, and long term holders are long term holders.  Some may cash some out to buy a house or pay for their daughter's wedding, but long-term holders are in for the long term.

"right now is farming between .8 and 1.8 BTC/day" sounds a little vague and unrealistic.
95 GH/s Avalons were mining .3 BTC/day prior to the difficulty adjustment yesterday, which will likely take it down to .22 BTC/day.
So...  280's are just 3 times the power, so today they will generate about .66 BTC/day.  You'll need to generate about 68 BTC over the lifetime to cover your $8500 expense, so you're talking about 103 days at the current rate, which is almost guaranteed to get cut by 25% in 10 days.  Then there's electricity and pain-in-the-ass-factor.
I would steer clear.  However, if you want to risk a third of the price to buy an Avalon that's a third of the power, I know where you can get one.

Nice job, Liz.
The one thing I would describe differently than you is wallets vs. Addresses.  It seems you say:  "Why do you have multiple wallets?"  "Change is sent to a new wallet..." etc.
I say wallets contain one or more addresses.  Coinbase is a wallet.  Bitcoin-QT is a wallet.   So I think you are using the term wallet, when you should be using Address.
Wallets contain one or more addresses.  Addresses contain zero or more unspent outputs.  (unspent "checks" from previous transactions).

Just pay careful attention to the transactions.
This will depend on how you take your coins out of cold storage.  If you use blockchain.info, for example, you have two methods: sweeping or importing the key.  
**Sweeping:**    
100% of coins will go from Cold-Storage-Address to Wallet-Address, with the "sweep".      
If you pay 50% to an address, 50% will go from Wallet-Address to destination, and 50% will go to Wallet-Address- (change).      
If you keep that wallet online you are fine.  If you want to move that to Cold-Storage- simply create a new paper wallet, and pay the balance to the new wallet.  Then the other 50% goes from Wallet-Address- to Cold-Storage-
No lost coins.
**Importing:**     
When you import the key, the money initially stays in your Cold-Storage-Address and can be spent from there.  Basically it's the same as above, but **it's how most people lose their money when not understanding change addresses**.     
If you pay 50% to an address, 50% will go from Cold-Stoarge-Address to destination, and up to 50% will go to Wallet-Address- (change).  Some could stay in your Cold-Storage-Address, depending on how you funded it originally.      
PAY ATTENTION HERE, now you have to either retain that online wallet holding both the Cold-Storage-Address and Wallet-Address- (don't dispose of it, throw away the password, or anything stupid), or pay the balance to a NEW cold storage address (which is probably what you want to do!)
If you want to move that to Cold-Storage- simply create a new paper wallet, and pay the balance to the new wallet.  Then the other 50% goes from Wallet-Address- (and also possibly Cold-Storage-Address) to Cold-Storage-
No lost coins.
Edited to clarify that some bitcoins could actually stay in your Cold-Storage-Address after import and payment to destination.

MAKE SURE you have a hard password on Coinbase, something different from any other password that you use elsewhere, and that you turn on 2-factor authentication (so that you need to use your phone to access bitcoins on your computer).
That will add levels of protection to your coinbase account.
Also consider moving your bitcoins to "cold storage" (a paper wallet, created totally offline).
The risk here is that a virus on your computer, or someone guessing your password (knowing your user name might be patrickowtf), might transfer your coins from your account to their own address, and you are screwed.

I second this.
You should only keep a small amount on your phone - the amount you need for spending.  If you are trying to "save" for the future, it's simple to get a paper wallet ( and press the print button).  Then just send to that bitcoin address.
For extra security, generate the paper wallet in a private browsing session unplugged from the internet (unplug after the page loads), and reboot after generation before you plug back in.

I didn't say I "believe it might be a fabrication".  I believe the burden of proof lies with the government.
My point in all this was that THE GOVERNMENT is saying he has 600,000 bitcoins, and I think that's probably bullshit.  It's gone from "he earned 600,000 bitcoins" to "he HAS 600,000 bitcoins", to "he's hiding $80M".  All this is a major leap in the government's statements.
Criminy, it's the government who said he spent 1670 bitcoins on a hit.  Have they deducted this (and all his other expenses) from the 600,000 BTC that they clam he earned and STILL HAS?  nope!

It took me a minute to get this, but are you saying that this could be a replacement for Silk Road?

Yes, this could be done, and is a great idea.  It would absolutely remove the single point of failure, and actually provide a less-friction environment than Silk Road - i.e. no commission, no single point of failure, etc.
You'd still want escrow and reputation.  But reputation could be signed, pseudonymous messages.

Put in the private key, and make sure the same bitcoin address gets generated.
It'd be a real bummer to have a paper wallet, and be funding the bircoin address for  years, and then find out that the private key doesn't work.
FYI, early on, there was a problem with a VERY early version of bitaddress.org where it would occasionally generate an unretrievable address.  Since then, they have run it through tens of thousands of tests to verify correctness.

It seems to me that this would be pretty trivial to figure out.
The average person (i.e. not current readers of this subreddit) will likely be inclined to trust, say, US Bank instead of coinbase.com.  US Bank could sell Bitcoin, store it, produce monthly statements, pay interest on it, lend it out, provide exchange services, etc.
To the average user, it'd look like a Bitcoin Mutual Fund.  Maybe there'd be different funds, like "Aggressive lending", "conservative investing", etc.  And most of the time it'd go up in value due to the "fractional reserve".
Actually, it sounds like more of a job for mutual fund companies, but banks could definitely get in the game.

If you haven't provided sufficient proof of identity, it can be up to a week.
Basically, coinbase has instant purchases of a limited quantity for anyone who has provided various proofs of identity.  The more proof, the more instant buying power you have.
If this is your first purchase, and you haven't run through the ten questions ("Which of these cars are you associated with?" etc), you probably will need to wait for the money to clear from your bank account, which is at least 3 business days.

If this were true, then a stock would almost always get stuck on the previous high.   Which is definitely NOT the case.
Example:  A stock's high is 25.  It hits 25.01.  It drops a few points.  Then it eventually wiggles it's way up to 25.02.  Then it drops a few points.  Then eventually gets back up, only to drop again.

There's a program called [NoBrainr]( that has very brief Python code for converting a phrase to a private key and generating the bitcoin address.
It'd be trivial to strip out the brainwallet stuff, and substitute a collection of dice rolls (you need 256 bits, so either 256 dice rolls of "even=0, odd=1" or 128 rolls of 2-bit calculations (1=01, 2=10, 3=11, 4=00, 5&amp;6 = do-over).
Something like this  (change the last line):
     v1.047 ** *** ******** *** **
    import random, ecdsa, binascii, hashlib
    
    def addr(pk):
     pko=ecdsa.SigningKey.from_secret_exponent(pk,ecdsa.curves.SECP256k1)
     puk=binascii.hexlify(pko.get_verifying_key().to_string())
     puk2=hashlib.sha256(binascii.unhexlify('04'+puk)).hexdigest()
     puk3=hashlib.new('ripemd160',binascii.unhexlify(puk2)).hexdigest()
     puk4=hashlib.sha256(binascii.unhexlify('00'+puk3)).hexdigest()
     puk5=hashlib.sha256(binascii.unhexlify(puk4)).hexdigest()
     puk6=puk3+puk5[:8]
     pubnum=int(puk6,16)
     pubnumlist=[] ; address=''
     while pubnum!=0: pubnumlist.append(pubnum%58) ; pubnum/=58
     for l in ['123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz'[x] for x in pubnumlist]:
      address = l+address
     if len(address)&lt;32:
      address = '1'+address
     return '1'+address
    print addr(0b000101001010111010101)   the binary number to your 256-bit dice roll
Edit:  This example has the hex private key of 295D5 (with a bunch of leading zeros, totaling 64 hex digits), and the bitcoin address of 13Lhfs19eUGG9WmXRJkJJWRGCoCwJzUg9f.  This can be verified at bitaddress.org "wallet details" tab.

Exactly!  It's the government trying to make him look evil.  he had expenses for almost three years, and the vast majority of that time, Bitcoins were values at one tenth of what they are now.  So when he had to cash out to pay expenses, he was cashing out at a much smaller value.  
I'm not going to believe the government's lies that there $80M hidden, until they show it to me on the block chain.  Can't be too difficult if it's there - the 1670 BTC "hit money" has already been found.  Go trace the inputs to that transaction and look for the pattern.  
You won't find any 600,000 BTC stash, even in smaller wallets.  (The hit money was a series of 500 BTC addresses, if I recall correctly.)

I think your best bet is a paper wallet, or several.  You can use the new BIP38 wallets (advanced feature of Paper Wallets tab) to generate deterministic addresses off of one pass phrase, using 
Personally, I think that the best way to make them available worldwide is to have one complex pass phrase for a brain wallet, and append a denomination.  For instance, let's say your pass phrase is the alphabetized list of the names of your six childhood buddies, plus your full name and social security number.  This is a HARD pass phrase.  Call that X for short, in the following scheme:
Use the following Brain Wallets:
X+1BTC, X+2BTC X+5BTC, X+10BTC, X+20BTC, X+50BTC, X+100BTC X+200BTC, X+500BTC.
Now you have 9 brain wallets, fund them accordingly, and then if you ever need to cash in any amount, you can, by memory, access the amount that you need.  (Scale as appropriate if you have less money.)

You know, I think I made my explanation way too complicated.
Bitcoins arrive at an Address.  If you want to spend them, you need to provide a Public Key (that hashes to that address) and sign it.  So an attempted spender provides those 2 items (call them pubKey and Sig).  
Three values are involved, the actual Bitcoin Address involved (call it pubKeyHash), and the two values provided by the attempted spender (pubKey and Sig).
The "typical script" says: 
     Push Sig onto stack (provided by the attempted spender), 
     push pubKey on stack (provided by the attempted spender), 
     duplicate top of stack (so pubKey appears twice, to be used in two operations)
     Hash top of stack (so pubKey is converted to its associated Bitcoin Address)
     Push pubKeyHash (the applicable Bitcoin Address of this output), 
     make sure top two items on stack are equal 
               (verifying that the Public key provided hashes to the appropriate Bitcoin Address), 
     verify the signature (the top two items on the stack, 
               verifying that the signature provided actually goes with the pubKey provided)
So the items provided by the attempted spender are pushed onto the stack and verified.

This is not irresponsible action.  This is actually market forces at work, and a few shrewd people made a lot of money on that.  "Sell High, Buy Low" can't work for everyone, but for a few, it was a successful strategy.
What you will notice if you look at the long-term graphs of Bitcoin is that generally speaking, the reactive falls in price are getting smaller, and the recovery time is getting shorter.  Measure the 30-day volatility (percentage spread between high and low), and look at the how it's on a downward trajectory.  
This is exactly the behavior one would expect in a stock that goes from penny stock to major player.  Two years ago, a $15 slide wiped out almost all the value.  Now, a $15 slide gets nearly recovered in 3 days.  In two years, we won't blink an eye at a $15 slide, as it'll be part of the normal daily fluctuation of a much more valuable asset.

If you buy the argument that taxpayers are funding hitmen, then you need to *look beyond that fact*, to determine whether Dread Pirate Roberts did anything wrong when he allegedly hired a hitman.  
Some things to consider are whether it was justified, and whether he was compelled to do it, under threat of prison (just as you are compelled to pay your taxes under threat of prison).
Attempting to wash your hands of responsibility for killing without trial, simply because you don't decide where the money is spent doesn't really cut it.  Once you know your money is being spent to kill people without trial, if you continue tax payments without taking action, you are complicit.

If you set up your account on Coinbase, and verify the little pennies that they drop into your bank account, you can probably purchase 10 bitcoins right then, that day.
They will honor the current price, but won't deliver them for approximately a week, waiting for the funds to clear.
If you step up your verification level (wait 30 days, answer questions about yourself - they will quiz you, like asking "which car were you associated with:  2006 Ford Taurus, 2004 Chevy Malibu, " etc., to confirm that you are who you say you are), then you move up a level in verification.  If you provide a Visa card as backup, you can buy instantly.

You can calculate the average amount that is held in a bitcoin address, but you can't tell how many addresses each user has.
Here's a 5-month old thread that tried to estimate how many Bitcoin users there are.  Note that some of the stats are 50% higher right now (like it says there are 100K readers on the forum, but now there are 150K).

Same as with Bitcoin, the burden is on the owner to make sure that they are the (only) bearer.  The payer (or in the case of Bitcoin, the acceptor of the Bitcoins in question) is absolved of any responsibility.  But this doesn't make the original theft legal or moral.  
(it is an interesting discussion, though.)
I'm not sure how  your points 1 and 2 relate to Bitcoin, but I'll take a guess.  I may be missing your points.
Point 1 looks like a denial of service attack.  Or maybe a stolen online wallet attack.  Or maybe you are saying this:  If the bitcoins still exist and are still in puzzle form, but you don't know the new private key, are they really stolen?  
Given that Bitcoins are attached to a private key in the same way as a dollar amount is attached to a ledger account, moving them to a new private key is essentially moving them.  In that sense, the analogy of number 1 fails:  For bitcoin, it's more like you put the entire safe into another safe with a new combination.  The property may still be in the exact physical location, but it is not available to me, and so it's likely stolen in the legal sense.
Item 2, I don't think standard Bitcoin money transactions work in the way you describe here.  If you pay me bitcoins, you no longer have the key or any control over them.  It's only if you transfer your private key to me (which is not a standard transaction) that both parties have the power to spend the coin.

I think this is something new.  It's the next logical step.
One thing you will want to have in there is a method whereby the community of users can help with the categorization.  In other words, you don't want some spammer to get top billing in every product category for his product.  And so a Reddit-style up/down voting to get irrelevant things out of the way might be important.  (or maybe a way for the community to specify what category something belongs in, if it's mis-categorized.)  
You'd also want categories to be flexible to evolve (sort of like bitmessage channels are not defined in advance).
I agree it's important work, and am willing to put energy against it as long as it's focused at being an Amazon-shops replacement, and not a Silk Road replacement.

The author can come up with two reasons why the exchange rate dropped on the day of the Silk Road closing:


Are those the only possible reasons?
Could it be that a large successful proof that the currency works well was coming to an end?
Could it be that some holders of the currency react to any huge news slightly related to the currency by predicting that others will sell, thus fulfilling a prophecy?
Could it be that some holders of the currency didn't know how to react, so they pulled their buy orders (and executed sell orders)?
Could it be that some people read that the Feds had seized a substantial amount of Bitcoins and feared that they may immediately liquidate them?
Those are four more reasons off the top of my head, without even thinking too hard.  I'm sure there are ten more reasons we could come up with!

Coinbase is like Paypal in the account setup process.  You provide a little info, hook it to your bank account, and begin to build trust.
The difference between Bitcoin and ScottTrade is that with Scotttrade, they really aren't having to trust you much.  You send them a check, so they have your money.  You buy stock, so they have your stock.   If you are a thief, they are well protected.
The main issue with buying bitcoin is that people want to buy it with reversible money, but Bitcoin is irreversible.  If a thief buys bitcoins with your credit card, by the time you realize it, the money is already in their hands, and it can't be reclaimed.  This is a "feature" of Bitcoin, in that middlemen can't reverse transactions on you or freeze accounts.  Middlemen like governments, banks, credit card companies, or Paypal.
So... the trick is to build trust that you aren't going to screw the company selling you the Bitcoins.  One way to do that is to pay cash dollar bills.  LocalBitcoins lets you deposit cash into a recipient's account, and then they know you can't un-do the transaction.  Coinbase relies on a week time lag to try to ensure that you aren't going to un-do the transaction.
With Paypal and credit cards, you can always call them and say "hey, I didn't get my merchandise (the bitcoins)" and then the seller is screwed.  So anyone accepting credit cards or paypal is likely trying to cheat you before you cheat them.

ok, now I am really confused.  Are you saying that you SHOULD or SHOULD NOT trust gateways?
My understanding of the link that I sent, was that a guy named TradeFortress offered people 1 BTC if they extended 10 BTC of trust.  Once he had 2 people trusting him, he could pay each with the other, with essentially IOUs.
As I recall (and it's been a while since I read that thread), he eventually had 140 or so people trusting him, each holding an IOU for a bitcoin.
So you had a hub with TradeFortress, and 140 spokes with people holding IOUs.
At least one person had a link to a gateway, like Bitstamp.  One person decided to exchange his 1 BTC for $125 (or whatever), and so he cashed the IOU, which came out of someone else's account, ultimately coming out of another person's bitcoin stash (probably stored on Bitstamp).
So... and this is just my understanding.... I am far from an expert on Ripple....  It looks to me like:
a) if I have bitcoins and      
b) I trust a family member, someone I trust in real life, and         
c) they trust someone that they know very well, and      
d) that "friend of a friend" whom I have no control over, falls for a scam like the TradeFortress experiment, and      
e) TradeFortress (or anyone he owes) decides to sell a bitcoin     
...then it comes out of my account.
My question is, is this true?  That I could be burned by a friend of a friend (or worse, someone much more remote than that)?
And then in order to collect the debt, I would have to convince my family member to convince his friend, that even though he doesn't know me, HE needs to pay me for getting scammed.  And in this example, it could have been a scam of 10 BTC (i.e. huge) that I would have to try to collect second hand.
THAT seems to be the issue.  If that's true, then there's an issue with Ripple that needs to be addressed.

Serveral ways to do this.
Simple way:      
Start a "private browsing" window (every browser has this, but they call it different things, like incognito mode).  Go to the site.  The page will completely load.  Then unplug from the internet (turn off wireless, etc).  Once the page is loaded, you are running it completely local.  You can keep generating paper wallets until you get one you like.  The idea here is that if you happen to have a virus that sends screen shots back to the "mother ship", it can't happen because you are unplugged.  Create the paper wallet and write down the pertinent info or print it.  You can even copy the Bitcoin address into a file (but not the private key).  Then reboot before connecting back to the internet.
or, you can "save the webpage" with the File/Save button.  bitaddress.org is exactly 1 file.  You can even check the digital signature (which is a bit of an overkill for most people).  Then unplug and do File / Open and navigate to the file on your local machine, where you saved it.... or simply drag that file to your browser window.  Again, best done in private browsing mode, and reboot afterwards.

If you hold, you can be assured forever that you will be at least as high as position number 3 Million, on the "people with the most Bitcoins" list.  (Since 21 Million total, divided by 7, means that if everyone higher on the list than you had only 7, all Bitcoins would be accounted for.)

You realize that you are proposing a change, right?
Currently, 1 BTC = 100M Satoshi.
[Here's the code](
    static const int64 COIN = 100000000;
In other words, one coin is 100,000,000 satoshis.
Maybe this will help:    
                  10 x             0.1 BTC = 1 BTC     
                 100 x            0.01 BTC = 1 BTC     
               1,000 x           0.001 BTC = 1 BTC     
              10,000 x          0.0001 BTC = 1 BTC     
             100,000 x         0.00001 BTC = 1 BTC     
           1,000,000 x        0.000001 BTC = 1 BTC     
          10,000,000 x       0.0000001 BTC = 1 BTC     
         100,000,000 x      0.00000001 BTC = 1 BTC    
So 100 Million satoshis  = 1 BTC
One BTC is subdividable into 100M parts.

Ripple is a great technology, but its major flaw is the human involvement.
This weakness has already been demonstrated.  Yes, you absolutely can select who you trust, but **it's been demonstrated that a significant portion of people are not trustworthy - not because they lack ethics, but because they lack technical knowledge and their ability to select trustworthy people.**
The attack I am referring to, I'm sure you are familiar with, someone offered to pay 1 BTC to anyone who would trust them for 10 BTC (if i recall the facts correctly).  And he got a tremendous amount of early adopters to fall for it.  (And the attack cost nothing except his reputation on Ripple, even though he "delivered" 1 BTC to over a hundred people, since his credit in the system was so strong.)
If the early adopters can't be trusted not to fall for that, good luck with Grandma!
I trust my family members to pay their debts.  I don't trust them to keep their PC virus free.  I don't trust them not to fall for a confidence scam, which was demonstrated.  I don't trust their technical skills.

because there's always a certain amount of downward pressure (given that inflation is at roughly 14% this year...  ~1.4 Million bitcoins being created this year alone).  So with inflation of the money supply that high, you'd expect the price to erode by that much due to inflation.
But news generates  interest which generates buyers.  And generates day-trading gamblers.
When the news stops, the new buyers stop, the gamblers bet on a price drop, and the inflation contributes to the price drop.

I think so few people have a clue as to what Bitcoin is, that there is a ton of potential upside.  The number of people familiar enough with Bitcoin to feel comfortable investing could double, and it still would be such a small fraction of the total population, that there would STILL be room for growth.
Take a poll at a family gathering or a barber shop, and you'll see that most people do not have a clue about Bitcoin. 
I'd expect media coverage to come in waves (as it has in the past), each time pushing the price to a new plateau.
In the next 2 weeks?  The price could go as low as $180 or as high as $240 without any more events.  With significant events, it depends on whether they are good news or bad news.

They aren't pending because they can't get the bitcoin.
They are pending because they can't completely trust you.  It's risk-mitigation for them.
Coinbase does a lot of risk-mitigation steps which simplifies the process of buying.  For instance, they offer the same exchange rate for 0.1 bitcoin or 50.  If you bought on an exchange, slippage usually causes your rate at 50 BTC to be higher.  This implies that you are probably going to get a better price on 1 BTC at an exchange than at coinbase, because you are paying for some slippage on coinbase.
They also quote a price and don't constantly change it, for a better user experience.  On an exchange, fluctuations can happen with every change in the order book, but coinbase smooths that out a little.  (Their price updates occasionally, though.)
And they try to determine how much to trust you, so that you don't have to have cash on account with them (unlike all exchanges).  There's a risk involved with that, and they mitigate that risk by trying to prove your identity and by adding delays.

You make a good point, but I wouldn't be too sure.
I ran some numbers with estimates of the marginal cost to produce the current generation of 110nm ASICs, and it seems to me that these (or better units) will continue to get added aggressively to the network until the difficulty is about 12.5x times what it is now, based on the current BTC price level.  That'd be about 5 months of 20% gains.
If Moore's law holds up in the ASIC market (with predictably smaller/faster/cheaper chips), this could be extended by another 3 months. And then things would begin to level off (which would take another 2 months to come back down to 2-3%.
If, during this 10 month period, BTC exchange rate doubles, then this extends the high growth period by another 40 days or so, as it's half as expensive to recover the marginal manufacturing cost. (and 120% ^ 4 is approx 200%, and 4 difficulty adjustments, each in 10 days, equals 40 days.)
In short, I can easily see 11 months of high growth before we return to 2-3%.  That should get us about 54% to the next block adjustment.  After that, who knows.  Probably, as you said, 2-3%, until Moore's Law kicks in again.

Bitcoin is fairly valued today, if you believe in efficient markets:  the whole supply and demand thing.
If you want to do some sort of technical analysis, you might consider something like this:  How many users are there, that would want to hold onto Bitcoins to be able to spend as small change - say for tipping.  Maybe 20K people want to have on average $10 of bitcoins on hand for reddit tips?  That's $200K of value.
How many want to have on hand an average of $100 worth of bitcoins for spending?  Maybe another half million people world wide?  That's $50M of value.
How many want to store on average $5000 for investment?  Maybe 400,000?  That's $2B of value.
A framework like that can give a way to estimate a value.  Right now about $2B is stored in Bitcoins.

I was pretty surprised/impressed in Europe that almost every restaurant or cab had a *mobile* scan device for cards.  I'd present my card, and they could perform the transaction at the table.
In some locations, it was very hard (or impossible) for me to use my credit card.  They all wanted me to enter a pin (which shows up as a cash advance on the Visa card, with interest charges from that day forward).  I wanted to use credit (and I don't even HAVE a pin!).  Finally, I figured out that the magic words were to say it was a signature transaction, not a pin transaction, and some people got that.
So, from my experience:  Pin transactions = expensive, but are the default.  (Maybe they would be free if I had it connected directly to my bank account).  Signature transactions always got the "sigh, not one of these" or "no, we don't do those" (for which I had to have the Krone / Euros / Pounds to pay cash).
My experience in three countries in Europe is that you all don't have it figured out quite yet - for an American traveler.  Three countries, three different currencies.  Can't easily take credit cards.  Major sigh with signature transactions.  High fees for pin transactions.
But I admit much might have been my ignorance, so I would take my opinion with a grain of salt.

Here are some more stats for you:
A 90+ Gh/s Avalon 4-card unit is currently generating about 2.7 btc/week.  Running for 2 months as a Batch 3, it would have generated 37 BTC.  Those that paid 102 BTC for these are likely to see a loss of 25+ BTC.

Your link was totally wrong in its conclusion.  What the author SHOULD have done was, rather than "straight-lining" the gains, look at them as a straight line on a log curve (in other words, derive a monthly percentage gain).
It's silly to think that these gains are the same:     
$140 to $280 in one month      
$49,860 to $50,000 in one month.
Read the comments.  And actually, the author is far too conservative.  We're on an +18% per month rate (in terms of the wealth being stored in Bitcoins), or about a +14% per month growth rate in price.  If this continues (and it seems to be accelerating), the price would hit $50K much sooner than 30 years.

I find this more comforting to think about this.... 
If you flip X coins in sequence, for small values of X, like 2 or 3, you are guaranteed to flip the same sequence that someone else in the world flipped.  But if X is large enough - say a million - there's virtually no chance that you will flip the same sequence as anyone that has ever existed or ever will exist. 
How big does X have to be, to virtually guarantee uniqueness?  160 flips virtually guarantees it.  50 flips would probably virtually guarantee it.  160 flips is a ridiculous number.

The whole Silk Road situation provides great opportunity for debate.  You can do a bunch of what-if's in this case, and it gets real interesting.  For example:
If DPR was just running Silk Road website (not dealing, not hiring hitmen), should he be convicted of a crime (just because others are using the website to buy and sell drugs)?  Silk road is hardly the only site that is used for that - people probably arrange drug transactions on CraigsList or Gmail all the time.
If Silk Road had in its terms of service that you had to be buying and selling drugs that were legal in your jurisdiction, does that help his case?
If it's entrapment for a cop to offer to sell you drugs, is it entrapment for the undercover agent to lure DPR into lining up a purchase of drugs?
If some user threatened to reveal all the names of his users / dealers, and those users and dealers were (according to the terms of service) legally buying and selling, and DPR had no apparent *legal* mechanism to address the blackmailer (since it was publicized widely that what he was doing was considered illegal by Senators and law enforcement), is it OK for him to take the law into his own hands?

It's a risk that most bitcoin owners (or bank account holders, for that matter) have been willing to take.


My intended use is to buy $1,000 worth of bitcoin and try to sell it in a year. I don't want to use it to buy products. I would treat it like a stock.
I wouldn't leave bitcoins on a website for a year; it's an unnecessary risk.  They could go out of business, get hacked, etc.  Better to hold them yourself, in cold storage.  Perhaps  paper wallet.  Simply pay the paper wallet address, and store the paper.

No, the difficulty jumps after 2016 blocks (generally 2 weeks worth, but not in the case you described).  2016 = 6 blocks per hour x 24 hours x 14 days.
In the case you described, 100,800 BTC could have been easily snagged before the difficulty adjustment.  The difficulty adjustment wouldn't catch up to a two-week span for a few more adjustments, So within about 2 weeks, you could have probably snagged nearly 403,200 BTC, maybe 4 adjustments in that 2-week span.
After that, you would have "owned" the mining game with a 5 GH/s miner, you could have probably mined nearly 100K BTC every 2 weeks for a year before the collective mining efforts of others caught up to you.   So that's another 2.6M BTC.
So you might have been able to grab 3M BTC (at the high end) in a year's time.

You want to set it up so that you use "2 factor authentication" which means that you have to use your phone to access your account from a pc. 
And then you want to link in your bank account, so you can buy.
2 ways to link to your bank account - either give coinbase access to your online banking (which is more instant), or have them make 2 small deposits (which takes a day or two).
If you provide them your password, change it FIRST, give them the new password, and then change it back.  Note that this may violate the terms of your home banking agreement (not sure).   Many people (including me) have no problem with trusting coinbase using this method.

I see you have a lot of pretty good answers here.
If you create a brain wallet from a string of any characters, yes you can re-generate it at a later date with those same characters.  Not true if you create a BIP38 paper wallet!
BIP38 paper wallets have "brain wallet" similarities (passphrase derived), but are on the paper wallet tab.  Each one of those will come out different.
Also, someone suggested using sha256sum to generate a random phrase for the brainwallet.  This is just 2 passes through sha256, so (as they said) make it extremely random as to what you type.  Doing something like "correct horse battery staple" and using the SHA256 of that to be your phrase is really asking for trouble.
The brain wallet will generate one address.  NOT a change address.  The change address gets created randomly in the wallet that you are trying to spend from.  So spend the brain wallet in its entirety.  You can do that in two transactions (from the same blockchain.info wallet) or you can "sweep" the brainwallet when you import it.
I still hold my private keys after spending the brain wallet, at least for a few days.  It'd be bad to get a refund or for there to be a problem with bitcoin or something, causing a loss.

You might consider a different way to buy them other than Mt. Gox.  They are expensive, because the person who took your cash (assuming US Dollars) will likely have a hard time getting the dollars out of there.
Three assignments for you:  
1) investigate other exchanges.  Or consider coinbase.com if you are in the US, which is not an exchange.  Think about and prepare for the day you might want to sell.  Because Mt Gox is a terrible place to sell for dollars, if you are in the US.
2) Set up 2-factor authentication on Mt. Gox.  This is for your protection.  Do this immediately so your coins aren't stolen.
3) get your money off of Gox and onto something that you control, like a paper wallet.

Minor nit:  It's the blockchain with the highest cumulative difficulty (which may not be the longest).
Consider this possibility:  The client has some block checkpoints hard-coded into the code.  You could go back to the last checkpoint, and start mining from there, on your own, with some ASICs, in a private network.  Difficulty wouldn't shoot up, because you have your own private mining network.  So you could quickly generate enough "less difficult" blocks to be longer than the current blockchain, by 10 blocks.  Then you could release that whole chain to the network.
That's why it's not the longest chain, but the most difficult chain.

1. coinbase (since you are in the US, mentioning politicians)
2. if you are buying a lot of bitcoins, consider sending them to a paper wallet from bitaddress.org.  Make a few copies and put them with your important papers.  (or start small, and leave them on coinbase)
3.  US does not equal world.  I find it to be worth the risk.    Risk an amount you are willing to lose. 
4.  The best way to learn it is to use it.  Start with $15 worth, and call it a training expense.  Move them around.  Try different wallets.  Coinbase will let you buy small amounts.
5.  The reason why the potential is so high is because they are not mainstream (yet), and have risk.  Remember, that money in your bank account - that's not real either.  In fact, you would hate a world where you got paid in coins and paper - no - direct deposit, bill payer, and other automatic payments just move digits around.

One slight error that I see in the video:  At 2:45, you mention that the Bitcoin Address is the public key.
For purposes of simplification, you might get away with this statement.  But in fact, the public key is NOT the bitcoin address.  The Bitcoin address can be derived from the public key (and not vice versa).
[The Bitcoin Address is a hash of the public key, and then it's padded with a checksum.](

Star-McCartney-Lennon = reverse alphabetical     
Ringo-Paul-John = reverse alphabetical
Given that I wanted to keep Ringo and Star, and could pick any other two Beatles (interesting how their names line up alphabetical by first name and by last name), I just chose the two so that all three were later in the alphabet.
George Harrison was eliminated because his name was too early in the alphabet.  Usually you get rewarded for being early in the alphabet - it's time we even things out.

Hey canton, this is excellent.
is there an easy way to generate a random private key using the bitaddress.org PRNG, and see it as a string of 256 (?) ones and zeros, and then just change a few of them, and then get it back to the 5xxxxxx format?  
Or am I going to have to muck with the javascript to do that?

Just realize that someone selling you a mining machine (whether it be a company or an individual) probably believes that they will get more money by selling the equipment, than by using it to mine.  And they probably know a lot more than you do, if you are new to Bitcoin.

yes, dollars, pounds, and euros use the cent system, and has 100 increments.

He's confused.
Deflation means that the value goes UP.  People have shown that at some point, it's likely that more coins will be destroyed than issued.  That is called deflation.  It raises the value of the existing currency.
Some of the same people have argued that deflationary economies have failed in the past (which is true, when it's unpredictable or out of control).  They make arguments like "who would spend their money today, when it's worth more tomorrow?  The deflationary economy won't work."
The same argument can be made (in reverse) for inflationary economies - who would sell their product today when they can sell it for more tomorrow?  The inflationary economy won't work."  
Except it does.

My point is this:
Buying Bitcoins on the internet with credit cards doesn't work easily and instantly because Bitcoins are irreversible money and credit cards are reversible money.
Another irreversible money is "US Dollars in cash", which is why I said it that way.  Not "in a bank account".  Bills **do** matter, when it comes to the question of reversibility.
So there's no movement of the goalpost.  It's a question of "can you buy irreversible money with a credit card over the internet?"  And a parallel example is buying US Dollars in cash.  And the answer is "no", you can't typically do that easily and instantly.  Same for Bitcoin.

I did this a long time ago, and so I am trying to recreate it today (different version of bitaddress, too)
Current version around line 5009, it looks like it creates the private key:
    Bitcoin.ECKey = (function () {
	var ECDSA = Bitcoin.ECDSA;
	var ecparams = EllipticCurve.getSECCurveByName("secp256k1");
	var rng = new SecureRandom();
	var ECKey = function (input) {
		if (!input) {
			// Generate new key
			var n = ecparams.getN();
			this.priv = ECDSA.getBigRandom(n);
Right after that line, you can "alert (this.priv) to see what you are dealing with.  And xor it with some constant of your choice.

You can still be profitable (over the cost of electricity) by running an ASIC machine.  But BUYING the ASIC machine will likely cost you more than you'll make over the lifetime of the machine.
Think about the people who sell Mining hardware - most of them believe that they will make more selling it than they would make by mining with it, and that's where they set their price.   If they don't get that price, then they will keep mining with it.
Here are some numbers for a 4-card Avalon Batch 3.  When it first arrived in August, it could generate about 1.5 BTC per day.  Now it can generate about 0.3 BTC per day.  Cumulative earnings to date:  35 BTC.
If the difficulty never rises again, it will take 7.4 months of additional mining, just to hit the original 102 BTC price of the machine.  
And a) we all know that difficulty will continue to rise, and b) this doesn't factor in the price of electricity, or the genuine pain in the ass it is to continually watch to make sure your money printing press didn't go offline.

If mining is mentioned at all, mining should be presented NOT as a way to get free money, but as part of the bitcoin architecture that ensures that the bitcoins which you receive are legitimate.  
Maybe:

These people are rewarded in Bitcoins for running the accounting function, and they are called miners."

Clearly, the more widely accepted Bitcoin is, the more value it has.  And so, clearly, early adopters and holders of Bitcoin have an incentive to encourage others to use it, accept it, buy it, etc.
But the difference between Bitcoin and a pyramid scheme is that a pyramid scheme RELIES on the next round of buyers.  And it collapses when you run out of new buyers.  Running out of new buyers forces the investment's value to zero.  So the **minimum value** is reached in a pyramid scheme, when you run out of new buyers.
Bitcoin's **maximum value**, in terms of utility, is when you run out of new buyers.  Like the telephone, fax machines, or email:  It's *more* valuable the more widely it is accepted and used.

Good response.  Let me take a crack at addressing your comments.
First, you quote the first step in my step-by-step argument.  I'm not sure if that's the particular step you think there's a fallacy in.  But you don't seem to address that first step.  I would be interested in hearing which particular step in my progressive argument you find fault in.
Second, you address accountability / responsibility of the uneducated.  My argument has nothing to do with that.  The specific point of my argument is that **people who pay taxes to fund military that kills without trial are hiring hitmen.**  Not whether they know they are.  Not whether they can be made responsible.
Third, you personalize this to try to make a point out of my situation.  My argument, though, has nothing to do with arguing that you shouldn't pay taxes, or frankly even whether hiring hitmen is right or wrong.  
My argument is simple:  that American taxpayers are hiring hitmen.  If you focus on that argument, and tell me where I am wrong, that would be a better counter-argument.  Otherwise, you have just pulled a common debate/legal tactic and gotten people to "look over here", avoiding the specific point that I made.

There's no need for a company to fill in a void.  Privacy comes with a price.  And that takes the price from cheap to not-so-cheap.
The reason is that if a company wants to have compliance in the US, they need to follow the laws of the US and collect all sorts of private information.
If they don't want to (or have to) follow the laws (because they are a criminal, or a small-timer, or not subject to the laws, or perhaps just prefer the more aggressive / permissive interpretation of the regulations), then they don't ask for the private information, and get to charge a little more.

Hey mike, 
Instead of sacrificing to the miners, why not sacrifice to some subset of those people who have already sacrificed?
I'm thinking of a scheme whereby you take the list of bitcoin addresses that have already sacrificed at least 6 blocks ago (which is provable by examining the blockchain), and hashing your public key with that list, and using the hash to determine which 10 or 100 addresses you'll split your sacrifice among.
That way, sacrifices are "loans", which you eventually probabilistically get back.  There's still a cost to it (time value of money), but it's not rewarding people outside the trust system (miners) excessively.

It depends on your objective. 
Are you trying to have a wallet that a mildly brain-disabled person can use to buy stuff, but not screw up?  In that case, I would break up your stash of Bitcoins into small amounts and make it harder to access the large stash.
Are you trying to pass along something after your death?  In that case I would use a shared secret with [pass guardian](
Hard to beat passguardian, but if you want a relatively low tech way to do this, type up a simple spreadsheet with some questions that only your closest relatives can answer, and only after consulting with each other.  ("In cell A1, type the last name of the guy who made a scene at my wedding.  In cell B1, type the last name of my best childhood friend, when I was 10 to 12.  In cell C1, type the street name that was the restaurant that I worked at, at age 20." etc, for about 10 questions.)
Then perform some crazy appending of the information (adding punctuation, capitalization, and salt), and give them that formula.  "In cell A2, put this formula exactly...")
Then if your relatives can answer all the questions properly, A2 reflects a 100+ character hard-to-brute-force combination of characters that can be used as a passphrase.  SHA256 that passphrase, and hide your bitcoins there.  You can even list the Bitcoin address of the result.
Then your "treasure map" can be in plain site for many people (like in your important papers, with your will, etc), but (hopefully) few people can get it without colluding with others.

Not to nitpick, but the limit isn't what prevents arbitrary inflation.  It's the mathematical release of Bitcoin that prevents arbitrary inflation.
The distinction is best illustrated by alt coins that inflate predictably, with no limit, but with the inflation controls removed from the politicians and controlled by design.

Some people associate the first (the previous) halving on November 30, 2012, with the reawakening of the interest in Bitcoin, driving the rally from November to the peak on April 10, where the price went from about $12 to $266.
I think there were a combination of factors at play; ASICs were being developed (and in February, they became a reality), some very large investors dumped a ton of money into Bitcoin (and then came public near the end of the rally, but you can bet they mentioned it to a few "inner circle" people), some more infrastructure came online (coinbase was more robust at that point, for example, as well as quite a few exchanges.)
My bet is that the masses will believe that this next halving will be a driver for another massive price move, and so in advance of it, there will be a rally.
But there's really nothing inherent in the halving that should affect price, in my book.  It's not a secret surprise event.  I suppose break-even miners who are relying on the income to fund their electric bill suddenly have their reward cut in half, so many will power off, making the network "less secure" for a period.

bitaddress is one HTML/javascript file.  So you can visit that site (online) and then save it to disk, and then totally unplug from the internet.  Or copy the file to a USB drive and move it to an offline computer.
Bitaddress.org also has that feature where you can look at "Wallet Details" by putting in a private address (generated at brainwallet) and verify the public key.

One thing that this talk merely hints at is that exits often happen on new frontiers.  Not just new lands that are part of the same old land paradigm.
For instance, America wasn't just another chunk of land attached to Europe.  It was a whole new paradigm, a vast continent to be explored and colonized.  Google wasn't yet another desktop operating system; it was a way to reduce the relevance of the desktop operating system; a movement to a new paradigm.
The *problem* I have with this excellent talk is that he builds it around a "Silicon Valley" exit, focusing on a chunk of land as a potential new state or country, and weaves in seasteading and mars colonization.
I believe that the next States will transcend chunks of land.  Why not have a "Virtual State" that is "cloud based" in some sense?  Then citizens of the whole world could opt in.  The whole concept that a state or a country is bound by a section of land defined by rivers and other natural and man-made boundaries is an obsolete concept.
What if "The United States of the Internet" arose as a force?  Or whatever you want to call it.  
Why limit your thinking to "we have to move to an island to exit"?  Isn't the cloud a valid location for this exit?

I don't know TradeFortress or whomever you mentioned.  You mentioned him as if I should know him.  I don't.  You seem to imply that he was a trusted member of the community which is why people accepted his offer.  I think it was out of greed and ignorance.  ("You're going to pay me 1 BTC to extend trust to you, in a system that is hardly in place, that I may never use?  Sure, I'll take your money.")  I doubt that there is a legally binding agreement anywhere (or even a clear explanation that I could understand) that explains the risk of this.
My understanding was that he utilized the system, acted as a scammer might, and someone *who was not directly scammed* lost Bitcoins (or a bitcoin), because they trusted someone who was a victim of the scam.
Is that not the case?  
It seems that you think this guy did a disservice.  I think the opposite.  Demonstrating flaws is a great way to get them fixed.  Sort of like the Bitmessage flaw that was demonstrated a month or so ago...  It's annoying, but helpful.

@_date: 2013-10-10 08:02:13
Actually, let me run the numbers a little more precisely.
I'd expect a 333 MH/s miner to generate about .0008 BTC / day if you had it in hand today.  This will drop by 20% every ten days for the next 11 months. (I did the math on this in another post.)
This gives you a lifetime payout of .04 BTC, or about $5 at today's exchange rate of about $125/BTC.  Factoring in electricity costs and wear on PC and pain-in-the-ass factor, it's probably not worth $5.
So I was low, when I said $1.50.  But don't buy for investment purposes.
(And if it takes a few days to get, and to get up and running, you can write off 25% of my estimate.)

I am no expert on this, but a technique that has been used for Vanitygen (creating vanity addresses) for some time now is that the user provides half of the secret in an encoded manner, and the online service creates a vanity address that the service does not know the private key for.
The same thing can take place with BIP38.  See the examples on the BIP38 documentation.  Basically, the user would use their passphrase on their local machine to derive a chunk of information that is passed to the online service.  The online service would then generate a paper wallet containing a Bitcoin Address and a BIP38 secret that starts with a 6.  
At this point, only the user knows how to spend the money, because they need both the secret that starts with 6, and the pass phrase, to arrive at the traditional Private key that allows spending.

But a boat 30 miles off of San Francisco isn't really immune to military and guns.  Shoot, places as far away as the Middle East aren't immune to US military and guns!
I definitely understand what you are saying, and you make some great points.  But I'll try to paint an alternate view.
Military is made up of individuals.  People.  Think back to various military in history... say, the military under some of the most oppressive regimes.  Take Hitler's military as an extreme (I choose Hitler's regime, since it's not too controversial to position that regime as evil).  Imagine if most of the PEOPLE of the military believed that the leadership was wrong, and needed to be overthrown.  That very well may have been the case, but they had no way to act on that belief without severe risk.
If there was a way for them to privately and securely express that belief, AND get acknowledgement that 75% of the others agree, AND that a revolt will take place at X-Date and time, then change to the existing system can be swift and with minimal collateral damage.
THAT is how I envision the impending cloud revolution taking place.  (This is not a roadmap for such a revolution, but more of a vague vision.)  I think Freedom will come through change, and that change will come through revolution.  And that revolution will be incited, coordinated and implemented through secure communications and the cloud.
We've seen revolutions coordinated by Twitter and YouTube in Arab Spring nations.  I believe it will extend beyond simple coordination.  It has to get to the point of re-enforcing my beliefs and letting me know that action is with minimal risk.

The way I have done it numerous times is setting up a blockchain.info new wallet, importing private key, and then spend THE ENTIRE AMOUNT to another address.
the reason you want to spend the entire amount is because any change would be returned to a different address. And since this is a temporary / disposable wallet, I don't want that.

It's a forth-like language, but the script language itself is invented purely for Bitcoin.
OK, here's my ELI5 version... I'm sure there are slight inaccuracies or over-simplifications, but it should give you the idea.
The concept is that there are a set of "op codes", executed one at a time.  It's sort of like having an advanced calculator, like an old HP RPN calculator.  The script is included with each transaction (like a little program attached to each transaction).  
For the vast majority of transactions, [it's virtually the same script](  It's a Stack architecture.  Each line in the script walks through what it takes to spend the money further.  
It says something like this:  
In order to spend the money that was put into this Bitcoin Address from this transaction, you are going to have to provide a public key that hashes to this Bitcoin address, and correctly sign it.  So the NEXT time the money is attempted to be spent, this script will verify the spending, by using the signature provided and the public key provided by the attempted spender.
Here are the exact steps.  










Does that help?

Yes, you are right: generally people generally don't need to worry about this, since most software handles it for you.
The way I think of outputs is to think of them like checks.  For a given bitcoin address, you *usually* have an output for each transaction that funds it.  So if you funded it in three separate transactions, you probably have three unspent transactions.
When you pay from that address, the software looks for a good group of unspent outputs that add up to at least the amount you are trying to pay, and uses them as inputs to the new transaction, and outputs to the new address and the change address.  Wallet software tends to examine ALL available unspent outputs across multiple addresses when deciding which ones to use.  (This often *taints* addresses by lumping them together in one transaction.)
So it's like looking through your wallet of unspent checks that you want to group together and sign over to someone else (leaving you with a new check for the change).

In addition, over 26 years, the number of transactions per block is likely to change drastically, which will affect the total of the fees in the block.

Mining on a standard PC will give you less in Bitcoins than it costs you in electricity and wear on your computer (unless you have free electricity and computers).  Mining on a standard PC will probably return pennies a year.
Now there are specialized bitcoin chips (ASICs, Application Specific Integrated Circuits) that are built into bitcoin mining hardware.  So if you buy an ASIC machine, you can generate enough bitcoins to cover your electricity.  But the sellers of those machines are selling them for a price that is higher than your expected return.  And why shouldn't they!  They are money printing presses in high demand.  So you can't even win if you buy a mining machine.
To earn bitcoins, think of them like dollars.  How do you earn dollars if you aren't the US Mint?  You work, or you sell stuff.

There will only ever be 21 M coins.  So if you own 1, there can only be (at most) 21M people who own 1 (or more).
If you own 3, then 21M/3 is 7M.  There can only be at most 7M that own 3 or more.

It is definitely possible to have a virus that records key strokes and screen shots, and sends them back home after a reboot; or one that manipulates the random function in your browser so that the wallet generated is compromised.
That said, there are zero known viruses that do this.  So the procedure of performing this task in a private browsing window and rebooting when done is a pretty good solution.
If you figure out a way to "ensure first you don't have any viruses or key loggers installed", you can make a fortune.  No one has figured out how to do that conclusively yet.

Your edit is asking the right questions.
The Bitcoin-qt  Wallet, and other wallets (Electrum, blockchain.info) automatically handle the multiple addresses for you, so it simplifies things tremendously.
If you are just doing storing small amounts, then use an online wallet (maybe coinbase or Blockchain.info.) for simplicity.
If you are investing and want to store a lot of coins, send them to ONE address (well, this is how I do it), using an offline method.  I like bitaddress.org, but there are some great solutions like Electrum and Armory which handle offline addresses very well.  (offline, meaning cold storage)

Ah, there's a lot there, and some are great points, while others I disagree with.
There have been many imperfect technologies that have survived 30 years.  Look at almost every internet technology that you use - email, TCP/IP, IPv4.  Better technologies have been proposed and designed and implemented, yet once you cross over a critical mass, the upstart can never supplant the installed base.  (Granted, Facebook unseated Myspace, and Reddit unseated Digg.)  Personally, I don't think an alt-coin will ever be able to pull that off.
I think you're wrong on deflation too.  That argument doesn't really hold up.  The issue is "unpredictable" x-flation, whether x="in" or x="de".  Your statement of "people stop spending in hopes of gaining more and more purchasing power" can easily be debunked simply by examining inflation.  Do people stop selling in hopes of gaining more and more selling power?  Clearly in an inflationary environment, you can get more money in the future for your goods than today. Why not stop selling?
Let's touch base in thirty years and see how this whole experiment plays out.

I think the question is still valid.  The USA policies are standing in the way of Bitcoin innovation.  (Bitfunder example just came up.)
The question shouldn't be framed in the context of "what will happen to Bitcoin if the US bans it", the question is "what will happen to the US if the US bans it?"
Honestly, if I ran the world reserve currency, I would be tempted to put obstacles in the way of anything that challenged that position.  (At the same time, I'd try to figure out a way to innovate the next generation to maintain the leadership position.)
This has happened in industry numerous times.  If you are IBM in the 80's, and own the "centralized mainframe" market, you deny, resist, and ignore decentralized computing.  If you are GM in the 70's, and own the big car market, you deny, resist, and ignore the small car trend.
The risk to the incumbent is that they will become irrelevant.  The risk to the upstart is that the incumbent will either succeed in trivializing the upstart, or come up with an innovation that makes the upstart irrelevant.

There's nothing really surprising here.  The more people who find out about Bitcoin, the more potential buyers there are, and so the more actual buyers there are.  
As bitcoin moves into wider circulation, you can expect this to happen, because more and more people see the long-term trend, and understand the utility of Bitcoin.
As time goes by, bitcoins are becoming more useful and held by more people.  This isn't too hard to figure out.

If you have a truly random private key, it's not feasible to brute force it, and never has been.  If this were possible, Bitcoin would not work.  
What you are asking is equivalent to this:  "If I flip a coin 256 times, can anyone guess the sequence of flips?" and the answer is no.  
Or, in the bitcoin context, it's really more like 160 flips.  And the answer is still no.  (Private keys are 256 bits, but someone can steal your money if they can guess a 160-bit hash that matches your hash.)
Other attacks are much easier.  The easiest is attacking the "random number generation".  One way that randomness is attempted is by taking a pass phrase and hashing it.  And this is where most vulnerabilities pop up in brainwallets.  People think they have a good random 256-bits, because they took a long phrase, like "Money it's a hit. Don't give me that do goody good bullshit" - 12 words, upper and lower case, with punctuation.  But it's 12 words that come straight out of a Pink Floyd song and so it's no secret.
Further, I think they forget that ALL people need is the passphrase to crack their money - no wallet.dat or piece of paper... nothing.  I can just scan the blockchain transactions watching for money to hit that wallet, and then grab it.
Other attacks on the Random number generation include examining the code for flaws, or trying to set the user's seed at a known value.

I would disagree.  We're just nowhere near it, and it cannot be reached anytime soon with the current technology (and the estimated mass of the universe).

Matt Damon reads from Howard Zinn's speech "The Problem is Civil Obedience" (November 1970)      
from Voices of a People's History PRO 1 year ago /
Matt Damon, a lifelong friend of Howard Zinn and his family, read excerpts from a speech Howard Zinn gave in 1970 as part of a debate on civil disobedience.
This performance was part of "The People Speak, Live!" with Matt Damon and Lupe Fiasco at the Metro in Chicago, on January 31, 2012, produced by Voices of a People's History (peopleshistory.us) in collaboration with Louder Than a Bomb: The Chicago Youth Poetry Festival.
Learn more at Facebook.com/VoicesofaPeoplesHistory and on Twitter 
Here's what Howard Zinn writes about this speech in his introduction to the full piece in his book Voices of a People's History of the United States, written with Anthony Arnove and first published in 2004 by Seven Stories Press:
"In November 1970, after my arrest along with others who had engaged in a Boston protest at an army base to block soldiers from being sent to Vietnam, I flew to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore to take part in a debate with the philosopher Charles Frankel on civil disobedience. I was supposed to appear in court that day in connection with the charges resulting from the army base protest. I had a choice: show up in court and miss this opportunity to explain — and practice — my commitment to civil disobedience, or face the consequences of defying the court order by going to Baltimore. I chose to go. The next day, when I returned to Boston, I went to teach my morning class at Boston University. Two detectives were waiting outside the classroom and hauled me off to court, where I was sentenced to a few days in jail. Here is the text of my speech that night at Johns Hopkins."

Jeff, add the feature that the digital signature need not have any Bitcoins in it!  That way, if the private key is stolen, there's no immediate loss of funds.
Advanced Feature:  The digital signature/private key access can be revoked with a Bitcoin transaction - perhaps a transaction that contains a revoke command in the message.  Then if my private key gets hacked, "all" i need to do is fund the bitcoin address, and then transfer those funds out with a revoke command.

Don't get too hung up on the units.
If it makes you feel better, 1 mBitcoin only costs 20 cents.
If you've ever owned a stock, and tried to make sense of the price, you have probably worked through this in your head.  "Wait, how can one share of NoName Inc. be more expensive than one share of WalMart?"  This has to do with how big the "whole" is - with a share of stock, you are getting a piece of the whole.
One dollar is one of many many dollars.  Trillions?      
One bitcoin is one of a maximum 21 million Bitcoins. (currently only about 12M)
(Note, bitcoin is not a "stock" in a company, but from that standpoint, and from the standpoint that the price fluctuates, it has some similar characteristics.)
@_date: 2013-10-30 16:35:04
This time it's different.^^TM
With Bitcoins, facebook, twitter, telephone, fax machines, the internet, etc., they thrive on the “network effect”.  The value of the network rises as the number of people using it rise.  (There’s a principle called “[Metcalfe’s Law]( that describes this phenomena.)  The person with the first fax machine was probably lonely.  But when there’s a second one, it’s valuable.  Bitcoins are a little bit of an anomaly from the rest of that list, though, because no one was buying fax machines as investments (well, maybe retailers were).  
Anyway, anything with a “network effect” like that still benefits from the next wave of buyers or users, but the system’s maximum value is reached when there are no more buyers.  When everyone has a telephone, the telephone network is a very valuable tool.  Bitcoin is a network of computers and people (merchants, users, investors, companies, etc).

Good question!   If their paper wallet is generated entirely in Javascript, it's probably OK. 
But the bitaddress.org paper wallet seems to be the one that has been around the longest and vetted the most.
Some risks of a coinbase version are 
a) that the private key is transported over the web (I am not sure), 
b) that you need to be connected to the web when you generate (which is NOT the case with bitaddress.org... not sure about coinbase)
c) that their random number generator isn't too good. (Not sure about coinbase's, but bitaddress has been pretty well examined)
d) that they generate a wallet that is unspendable (i.e. the private key isn't right for the bitcoin address).  This was a VERY early problem with bitaddress.org a couple of years ago and was quickly resolved.  Since then, they have run tens of thousands of tests to try to find edge cases that fail.  Has coinbase done that?
You could verify (d) by using bitaddress.org and doublechecking.
I am not bashing coinbase.... I just don't know about it's paper wallet.

I may be boring you with stuff you already know - if so, sorry.  But in the "real world" there's a calculation on stock called dividend yield.  And it definitely is a factor in the fundamentals of a stock.
Example:  [Duke Energy]( has a yield of 4.58% currently.  Basically what the most recent dividends were, compared to the current price.  That's basically what did.
Yield is a major factor in non-growth stocks, but in growth stocks, it's much less relevant, which is what you are basically arguing.  For example, certain tech stocks have never had a dividend, and so you are betting on their continued use of the earnings to generate more value.
AsicMiner was originally positioned as a high dividend company, and was valued for its dividend yield.  Now that it is retaining some earnings and the dividends are shrinking, it's losing its luster as a dividend producing stock, and you have to evaluate the success likelihood as a growth company.
Unfortunately, mining is a highly competitive, non-growth market - the only way to grow is to continually innovate at an increasing rate.  Pretty tough.
Still, you point out a reasonable "flaw" if that's all you are considering.  A better way for to have expressed it might have been a yield:  Do you really want to tie up your capital for such a small percentage yield? (of like 25%, which isn't tiny!)

The whole financial system is oriented around companies doing exactly this, for stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities, etc.  Opening up Bitcoin to that market is, in my opinion, a great thing for Bitcoin.
I can't speak for whether these particular guys are crooks or ethical, but I think trusts and funds like this are going to open up Bitcoin to a whole new class of investor.  
And when the bitcoin exchange rate eventually goes up to about $830, a $10B asset class is all of the sudden open to a whole new set of funds that aren't chartered to invest in anything smaller than $10B, and you'll see the price blow past the price of an ounce of gold in no time flat.
There's a market here for people who don't have the time or capability to secure their own Bitcoins.

It is still very volatile, yes, but it has changed.  There are standard measurements for volatility, and I do measure it.  And it's down from 2011 by 2 orders of magnitude.  You can measure it on a daily or a 30-day or a 6-month basis, and it's waaay down in every case.

Ignore the comments about taking a 10% haircut.
Mt. Gox will likely have the tightest bid/ask spread, with BitStamp coming in second, purely because of the volume.
So, yes, just realize that the price will be 10% higher, but you don't care about that, because your first transaction will be a sale of Bitcoins (so 10% higher is GOOD), and your last transaction will be a purchase of Bitcoins (so 10% higher is bad).  It will basically even itself out.  
Realize that you can't easily get US Dollars out of Mt. Gox.   You will need to transfer the coins elsewhere to convert them to dollars.
Also, there may be a little bit of existential risk on Mt. Gox  (or any exchange), as they could go out of business, leaving you out of coins or dollars.  
Another way to gamble with them is to take them to  and place bets.  You can place bets with a 1% house advantage.  Or you can be the house, and presumably "benefit" from that advantage, at the cost of being out of control of the betting.

No one can tell you what will happen, short term or long term, with any accuracy.  So be skeptical of any advice, including mine.
You can look at past rallies, and draw some conclusions.  But the past has nothing to do with the future.
I think most of the driving force behind the rise in price is the fact that there is a growing belief that it might be a good long-term investment.  Growing meaning that more people are believing it more-per-person.
Phases in the past have included run-ups in price and pull-backs.  You can chart the major cycles and see 4 or 5 of them historically, and *historically* they have lasted (on average) about 3 months from trough to peak, and another 5 months from peak to trough, with each trough being higher than the last one.  But each rally is different, and the past is no indicator of the future.
If the last trough was in July (near $60), then 3 months is almost up.  If the last trough was in October (with the SR bust), then there's a lot of room to rise.
So flip a coin.  Heads, this bot below me is moronic; tails, it's a genius.

There was a 2-day sale on bitcoins.
Wise buyers jumped on them after the panic.  My feeling is that a recovery to $127 today will signal that the SilkRoad bust was no big deal (once the news was digested), and Bitcoin is free of the stigma of SilkRoad and carries on (leading the price quickly to $160).
Ask any market expert, or imagine for yourself, what a ten year price path of any marketable commodity from 5 cents to $1000 would look like, and I think people would agree that it would look like this!  Early days, it would have a ton of volatility.  But as time goes on, the volatility becomes smaller and smaller, and the time recovering from price-dives becomes less and less.

I thought the wording was that the **transaction** appeared to be high risk.

The beauty of the Bitcoin "System" is that you can create your own personal "Account number and Pin" that only you know (called the Private Key).  And derived from that number is a Bitcoin address (a "deposit-only account number", so to speak) that you can give to anyone.

The bug that gmaxwell mentioned was that a password was required when requesting a new address.  Not that duplicate addresses got generated.
I still think that this is just another case of an address being reused (not a random collision).  But the situation never got closed on the forum.  All the OP would need to do is to either confirm the steps that gmaxwell suggested (and admit their error), or perform the steps that gmaxwell suggested and prove that there is an error.
Another thing that might help is if the OP would say "I never ever had 50 bitcoins" (which was the amount transferred to that address).  But I find that highly unlikely.   This is user error, I think.

The paper wallet has the bitcoin address and the private key.  Removing the private key from the paper wallet renders it useless - except that people can send money to your bitcoin address.
So putting a paper wallet in a plastic bag and burying it, without the private key is really like burying a piece of paper with a public address (which everyone can view online anyway).
If you are trying to figure out how to safely store your private key, consider  which allows you to split your private key into n pieces, requiring m of them to be used to discover your private key.  Example, you could split it into 5 pieces, and require 3 of 5 to collaborate.
Then put the 5 pieces in 5 good hidden places.  Like with friends.

The Bitcoin software deals with integers, and the current implementation stores satoshis as the unit.  So quantity=1 is one satoshi.
There's a field in the code that specifies the multiple of units that equals one bitcoin, and it's set to 100000000.   So 100 Million atomic units is called a Bitcoin.
That's just how the current protocol works.  Integer math is better for counting money, rather than floating point math.
If the protocol and clients changed such that the multiplier was bigger, then Bitcoins would be more sub-dividable.
[Here's the code](
    typedef long long int64;
    typedef unsigned long long uint64;
    
    static const int64 COIN = 100000000;

You list some things that every full client does, when determining whether to pass along unconfirmed transactions into the P2P network.
The basic objective of mining is to add some "sequencing" to the transactions, since otherwise they arrive at various nodes in different sequences.
So basically, all miners are doing is taking what is considered valid, unconfirmed transactions, and batching them up, and adding work to them.
I saw a layman's explanation of this the other day:
Let’s use an analogy of the normal banking system.  Think about if we all used US Bank and all wrote paper checks to move money from account to account.  Say I had $100 in my account.  If I wrote 2 checks for $100, one to Alice and one to Bob.   Whoever’s check gets processed first gets the money, and the other check would bounce.  US Bank performs that function.
To simplify things, picture one banker at US Bank performing this function of processing all of the checks.  Every time he receives a batch of checks, he records the movement of money in his ledger, and then he paperclips the batch of checks together puts them into a shoebox.  This system works great.  If I complain about a bounced check, he can go back through the shoebox of batches of checks and prove that I already spent that money on Alice, so that’s why the check to Bob bounced.  
But since I am evil, maybe I get a job as a night janitor at the bank, and realize that I can simply reach into the shoebox, and take out that check to Alice, and the proof is gone. 
So the banker says “ok, paperclips aren’t going to work.  I’ll try a stapler.”  But that’s not a good solution either, because I can remove the staple, and re-staple the checks.  So finally he comes up with an idea to put a giant paper-weight onto each batch of checks.  This is a two-ton paper-weight.  He figures that once he performs the work to put the paper-weight onto the stack of checks, anyone who wanted to mess with the transactions would have to do at least as much work to undo the transactions, by removing the paper-weight.  Furthermore, if he processes the checks in batches, he can put later batches on top of earlier batches, so that older transactions are even more secure (because they have multiple paper-weights on them).  So a thief might be able to move 2 tons.  But what about 4?  Or 6?  Or more!
Bitcoin mining is performing work (like the work necessary to place a two-ton paper-weight) on a batch of transactions to lock them in place, so that no one can mess with them (by reversing transactions, or slipping in extra transactions, for instance).

I was thinking of step 3 as being perhaps corrupt unions.  It's happened before, where money is taken from your paycheck because you join a union, and then the union is committing organized crime.
As a dues-paying, voting member of that union, you have a little contribution and responsibility.
As you scale up to Federal government size, you are right in that your responsibility gets diluted.  But "we" collectively run the government, in that we elect the leaders, and determine the agenda.  So there's definitely SOME responsibility.  I don't think you can shrug it off and say "wasn't me!"

I don't think you understand how Mt. Gox works.
You make a deposit in a currency.  You have a balance in that currency.  Then you can exchange it.  Mt. Gox doesn't do any conversion back and forth (elsewhere) between currencies - they simply link buyers and sellers.  In fact, Mt. Gox states that they (nor their employees) will not be a party to an exchange.
[In the left pie chart]( you can see that the Mt Gox USD market is a separate market from the Euro and Yen markets.  There's no "I exchanged it for USD, and now I want Yen".  It doesn't work that way.   If you sold bitcoins for USD, and want Yen, you have to take extraordinary steps, and Gox won't do it for you.

There is a flaw in the question.
See, she wants to know what backs Bitcoin, because she remembers the day when Dollars were backed by Silver or Gold.  But then you have to ask her what backs the silver or gold.
The utility of Silver or Gold is only "worth" what a substitute  costs.  And yet the value of Silver and Gold are FAR beyond what substitutes cost.  So there is some "imputed" value - a value based on the belief that it's valuable.
Bitcoin has utility that is beyond Gold or Silver.  Its utility has value.  That value is equal to a substitute (of which there is none.  You can name other alt-currencies, but none has the network of support/merchants/exchanges/holders).  But the imputed value is far beyond that. 
So, basically it's comparable to gold or silver, in that its primary value is imputed.

@_date: 2013-10-20 13:21:52
OK, let's take inventory of where we are:
1.  Author of the article makes a ridiculous claim that some rich person could in theory buy all the bitcoins.
2.  I state an opinion that this is ridiculous, and provide facts to back it up.
3.  You try to challenge my knowledge, by stating that I don't know what "theoretically" means, and further demonstrate that you don't know that it means.
4.  I explain the flaw in your logic.
5.  You admit that the author's contention is false, and proceed to jump into childish name-calling.  You use the wrong word in your name-calling, further demonstrating ignorance.
6.  I explain what "theoretically" means with a link so you can see the error in the article, and also help you understand the correct word to use in name calling.
7.  You attempt to further diminish the value of accuracy in communications, with statements about spelling bees and how opinion pieces don't claim that what the author believes is correct.  
Let me help you with this.  An opinion piece is "An article in a publication expressing the opinion of its editors or publishers."  
And an opinion is "a view or judgment formed about something, not necessarily based on fact or knowledge."  
So by claiming you wrote this as an opinion piece, you are claiming that this is your view.  But you cannot admit that your view might be wrong, and also claim that in order to admit that it's wrong, you'd first have to admit that it's right.
Your circular logic does not provide any credibility.  Why should anyone bother to read or believe anything you write?
Then, you admit your failings in being able to figure out who I am, as if this is somehow my fault.  Do you not realize that "bitcorati" is every bit as much of an anonymous reddit handle as "16rjg4"?  
I'm not hiding in the least.  What you are apparently saying is that you cannot figure out who I am, but that's more a statement of your ignorance and lack of capability than any hiding on my part.  I'm not anonymous whatsoever.  
I guess you want to try to meet me and beat me up.  Come back when you mature a little.  
**TL;DR: If you are going to write something, and expect people to read it, get a little backbone and accept the criticism when someone actually *does* read your blabber, and has some valid criticism.  Don't turn into an immature crybaby.**

I mentioned bitaddress.org in another comment.  But to expand on this guys points, Armory is a nice solution.  It's harder than bitaddress.org, but a great way to go.
printing a blockchain.info wallet onto paper doesn't empty your wallet per se.  What you want to do is create a paper wallet, and then transfer your funds to it.
You can use blockchain.info to see the transaction, and to see the contents of any bitcoin address.  So simply watch the money flow, viewing the transactions.  
If you have a paper wallet (with a private key on it), don't ever let that private key be entered onto a device that is connected to the net, and you are safe.  When you want to spend, you can enter it.

The headline statement is "Mining is unprofitable", which is absolutely, positively, without a doubt, incorrect as a global statement.
I have a mining machine that I got for free.  The costs to compare are the *marginal* costs, not the costs to obtain the machine, to ship the machine, etc., which in my case were zero.
Compare electricity and labor costs vs. revenue, and it's a no-brainer.
Why would ANYONE STOP mining if their revenues exceed their marginal costs?

The challenge with Bitcoin's shared ledger, where transactions can be entered from anywhere in the world, is determining the sequence of transactions, to make sure that when money is spent once, it's not spent a second time.  To sequence the transactions, work is performed on each batch of transactions, analogous to taking a stack of checks and placing a giant paper-weight on them to hold them in place.  In order to change the sequence, someone would have to perform at least as much work to move that paperweight.  
The worker that performs that accounting function gets rewarded with Bitcoins, solving multiple problems at once:  how to sequence transactions, and how to fairly initially distribute the supply of bitcoins.

When you see the tremendous amount of development that has gone into the client over 5 years, it helps to show that it's continually changing.
Imagine this same visualization, only add in a visualization of developments of mining software, other wallet software, mining hardware, Exchange infrastructure, website measurement tools, forums, merchant infrastructure, conferences, media coverage, bitcoin organizations, bitcoin companies, online presentations, financial products, celebrity endorsements, and angel investor activity, and you have a SHITLOAD of activity over the five year period, that is growing every day!

As someone else said, buy the coins, it'll be cheaper.
But if you REALLY want to mine 30 Bitcoins per month, expect to pay about 60 bitcoins the first month, and then 35-40 bitcoins every month after that.

Who said anything about 80 million?  You are confused.
We're talking about 600,000 Bitcoins.  Which, when Silk Road started, was worth less than $600,000.  For the vast majority of the time that Silk Road existed, Bitcoins traded for under $20, and for a significant portion, under $8.  In the early days, probably nearly every bitcoin that came in went back out.  
And it's documented that he spent 1670 bitcoins on a hit, and another $80,000 on another hit.  You can go look at [the 1670 BTC transaction on March 31]( and follow the money backwards and see that he spent a lot of his stash.  He's not sitting on 600,000 Bitcoins.  That's what he brought in over the lifetime of the project.

There are legal and ethical questions tossed into this subreddit a lot.  For example:
-  If I try a pass phrase ("Brain wallet") and there happens to be bitcoins stored there, can I have them?  Am I a thief?
-  The FinCEN regulations are confusing.  If I mine bitcoins, do I have to declare myself to the government?  Or if I sell my mined bitcoins?  or what?  Who is subject to what regulations?
- There are regulations that state that if you store $10,000 in a foreign bank at any time during the year, you need to declare it to the US Government.  What if it's $10,000 in bitcoins that I purchased in my basement and store on my hard drive?  What if it's $10,000 worth of bitcoins stored on account somewhere (like Mt Gox / Japan or Just-Dice / Canada I think)?

Let's start with something completely understandable, but without perfect security, and build up from there.
1) Go to   Generate a paper wallet, print it out, and make sure you understand it.  It's got a bitcoin address that you can send funds to, and it's got a private key that allows you to retrieve it later.
If you can understand this, then you are well on your way.  No need to send anything ... you are just learning.
Now, if you get that, you have several challenges:     
a) how to generate such an address securely      
b) how to access the money later      
c) how to store the private key in a secure fashion
So try (b) first.  Go to blockchain.info, and start a wallet, and make sure you can import the private address.  Pretty simple.
then consider (c).  Can you store the piece of paper that you printed?  Would you rather split that among friends, so that n of m are required?  If so, look at  and split the secret among 3 or 5 people or whatever.  Just practice it, and make sure you know what you are doing.
Practice costs you NOTHING.
Then let's work on (a).  You can download the web pages for bitaddress.org and passguardian.org simply by pressing the File / Save Page As... menu option in the browser.  This is easy.  Do that.  Then unplug from the internet, and see if you can open those pages.  If so, you're in good shape.
Then try generating paper wallets, printing them, and creating a shared secret, all offline.  You can do it on this computer, and it costs nothing.  
If you want to increase security, you can now do all of this with a computer that has never been online, and never will be online.  That's the most secure.

Getting USD out of Mt. Gox is NOT EVEN CLOSE to the same thing as getting EUR out.  You described a process that a significant amount of traders cannot do, and the others need to perform extra steps and need extra time.
Tell me how the average user could get USD out of Gox, without extra steps or time, and I'll buy it.  You  just haven't done that yet.
The proof is in the price frankly.  If it was so seamless, then there wouldn't be a $10 price difference between Gox and other exchanges.  Market forces would cause arbitrage which would bring the prices closer together.
$10 is hardly arguing semantics.
I can see you cannot be convinced, and you are so far down the path of your argument that it would take some real backtracking for you to admit you are wrong (or for me to), so we'll have to leave it at "agreeing to disagree"..

Nonsense.  Think about it.  Say Satoshi got onto BitStamp and sold all his BTC and did a withdrawal.  How can BitStamp afford to pay him?
Duh.  Every Bitcoin sold is a Bitcoin bought.  So someone put a ton of cash on deposit to buy those bitcoins.  Every exchange should have the cash to pay out every withdrawal, as long as they aren't running a fractional reserve system.  Mt. Gox - not so sure.  Everyone else... well, if they run an "operations" budget out of commissions, then yes, they have all the deposits backed by cash, whether denominated in Bitcoins or fiat.

Will you sell me one bitcoin for 10 million satoshis?  I'll take that deal all day long!  In fact, I'll pay you double that, for one bitcoin.
[Here's the code](
    static const int64 COIN = 100000000;
In other words, one coin is 100,000,000 satoshis.
Maybe this will help:    
                  10 x             0.1 BTC = 1 BTC     
                 100 x            0.01 BTC = 1 BTC     
               1,000 x           0.001 BTC = 1 BTC     
              10,000 x          0.0001 BTC = 1 BTC     
             100,000 x         0.00001 BTC = 1 BTC     
           1,000,000 x        0.000001 BTC = 1 BTC     
          10,000,000 x       0.0000001 BTC = 1 BTC     
         100,000,000 x      0.00000001 BTC = 1 BTC    
So 100 Million satoshis  = 1 BTC
One BTC is subdividable into 100M parts.

Go buy you bitcoins, using standard methods (coinbase in the US or localbitcoins or bitstamp).  Then SEND them to the bitcoin address on the paper wallet.

Second, attempted double-spends can be easily and trivially detected in seconds.

Avalon was the first to deliver, although they have had their share of delivery problems.  Consider buying the Avalon machines at auction from tradehill.com
I think if you pay the prices that are listed on avalon-asics.com, you will be wasting money.  You cannot get your investment back through mining, at those prices.

Blacklisting coins is a really bad idea, I agree.
Colored coins is an attempt to make some bitcoins more valuable than others.  (e.g. this satoshi is worth much more than a satoshi, because it represents 100 shares of Apple stock.)
With fiat, collector coins are more valuable than others.  But you can still always use a rare coin for face value (with the exception of things like confederate dollars.)
It's also interesting to think that one piece of paper is one hundred times more valuable than a nearly identical piece of paper, simply because it has 100 printed on it instead of 1.

What fundamentals have changed in the past 7 months, since February / March?
Bitcoin is only about 57 months old, so those 7 months are about a 14% increase in longevity without major issue.  Longevity adds to the trust.
In those 7 months, ~20,000 businesses signed up to accept bitcoin through bitpay and coinbase.
In those 7 months, several governments have taken stands on the legitimacy of the currency, and, more importantly, have not taken stands against the legitimacy.
In those 7 months, there have been numerous conferences, famous people speaking out with interest about Bitcoin.
In those 7 months, major financial organizations and financial news organizations have stepped up their coverage of Bitcoin and expressed interest in financial products for holding Bitcoin.
During those 7 months, many ASICs came online, strengthening the system from double-spends. 
In those 7 months, there has been more interest, many more news stories, more fence-sitters deciding that holding bitcoin might be a good decision.
In those 7 months, millions of dollars of venture capital has poured into Bitcoin businesses.
In those 7 months, the number of Bitcoin Businesses (exchanges, stores, etc) has probably risen by at least 25%.
Those 7 months were 7 more months of "proving ground" for the currency, as it was utilized heavily in Silk Road.  And it was proven to work as a currency or payment system very well.
During those 7 months, the largest illegal use of Bitcoins was removed, without Bitcoin being shut down.  And even with that shutdown, the resiliency of Bitcoin was demonstrated, both because the government couldn't seize some of the Bitcoins of a suspect, and because the exchange rate didn't crash to zero or $50 when Silk Road was shut down.
My opinions, the fundamentals have changed.
@_date: 2013-10-06 13:46:29
Well, I didn't mean to take this discussion in the direction of arguing for or against the ethics of the person who conducted the demonstration.
My question is, is my understanding correct?  That someone who was not directly scammed lost bitcoins in the demonstration.
If that's the case, then there needs to be some sort of correction in the system to prevent that.  It might be a social correction (like training, legal agreements, better docs).  Or it might be a technical correction.

@_date: 2013-10-22 17:35:49
It's a bit self-fulfilling.
First, there is downward pressure because of a currently high inflation rate.  New money is being printed (that is, new bitcoins are being mined) at an annual rate of about 14% this year.  So that exerts some pressure that causes each existing bitcoin to be worth less.
Second, people get excited and buy in.  Excitement drives the price up.  When the excitement ends, people panic and figure they can time the market, and dump. The more it falls, the more people dump.  Then the panic-ers ("weak hands") are all removed from the market, and a bottom is reached, and we start the cycle over... each time pressing forward a little higher than the last.

As long as it's less expensive to run a mining machine than the fees received, they will be run.  In fact, it's already been demonstrated that some people will run them even when it costs them money (maybe they have free electricity; maybe they are math-challenged, or philanthropic; who knows!)

Don't get me wrong: coinbase is good.  If you are in the US, it's probably the best way to buy small amounts of Bitcoins (less than, say, $5000 at a time.. initially less than 10 bitcoins per week, though).
Coinbase is super easy.  But if you are storing lots of Bitcoins, you may want to learn more, and then move them OFF a web wallet, and into a more secure setup, like your own cold storage.
Coinbase is about 3 to 5 fairly well funded guys.  It wasn't too long ago (a couple months?) they were blogging about employee    But if an earthquake takes them out, you could be out some money.  For $1000, it's probably worth the risk.  For $100,000 well..... better to study up on securing your coins!

A brain wallet is simply a way to take a phrase and convert it to a private key using a standard algorithm.  See brainwallet.org or bitaddress.org
So people use stupid phrases, despite repeated warnings that if it's been in print, it's been indexed by google, and therefore it's probably been hashed and therefore it's easily swept.  Google published a list of phrases of 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 word n-grams, and so that is probably the list that people have hashed and are using.
Basically, the thieves simply hash all the n-grams, and store a database of compromised bitcoin addresses.  When one appears on the blockchain, they sweep it.
This isn't hard folks.  If it's been on the internet, don't use it.

And you may have to try to figure out which one, of many transactions, is yours, based on the date/time you sent them, and the amount.
But really, as the previous person said, they are doing it wrong if they are asking you for a sending address, because there are often many addresses that make up a transaction.    But you should be able to answer their question (even though it's a stupid question).  A better question would be "what's the transaction ID" which may be visible in the Mt Gox history.

Maybe you are asking about the price difference between exchanges.
Some are easier to get your US Dollars out of, if you sell your bitcoins for dollars.  Others are really hard.  Mt Gox is really hard, and that's reflected in the price.  People want more dollars for the bitcoin, because once you have dollars, it's hard to do anything with them, except for buying over-priced Bitcoins on Mt Gox.

I can, and do, trust my family at levels of 10 BTC.  I've lent that much in USD frequently, and gotten paid back.
I do not trust that each of my family members is savvy enough to protect their PC from malware or that they won't fall for a confidence scam.  
 
That's the level of trust that would be needed for me to trust them via ripple.  Ripple forces me to bet that they can keep their PC clear of trusting-malware and steer clear of confidence scams.  If they fail, I lose.  That's not a bet I am willing to make at any substantial level. So the benefit of Ripple better exceed that miniscule bet level, or it will not work for me.

"address" means two different things here:       
IP address is of the relay node.       
Bitcoin Address is the address that got the reward.
Different Bitcoin Addresses doesn't necessarily mean different people.  And a study was shown that indicated pretty definitively that the vast majority of those early untouched 50 BTC block rewards belong to the same person, because you could watch the nonce count upward.  These are widely believed to be controlled by Satoshi.

It has name recognition, and a great automated platform.  People can still use it with their automated buy-and-sell algorithms, but ultimately if they end on "sell", their money is trapped.
You are betting that the Mt Gox withdrawal problems get resolved (or at least the market perception changes).  If suddenly everyone thinks that Mt. Gox's problems are just about resolved, those with cash on Mt Gox will be very happy to buy bitcoins at a normal price and transfer their coins to an exchange that allows them to get their cash out.

There are actually several techniques used, with fallbacks.  You are hitting on a real good point, in that you need to bootstrap from somewhere.
There are some known good ip addresses that are hard-coded into the software for bootstrapping.  There was also a fallback to listening to IRC to get a list of nodes, but I believe this was phased out (or made a last resort) some time ago.

Almost certainly, more bitcoin fortunes have been lost than gained this way.
Consider this:  Attempting to sell high and buy back lower means that you need to not only guess right, but also guess right by a certain margin.  You are immediately at a disadvantage due to commissions and bid/ask spreads.
Since many people are trying this, a lot of the time, half are on one side of the transaction and half are on the other.  In those cases, the buyer and seller average each other out (in terms of expected gain), at an expected Loss, and the only winner is the exchange.

You are speaking of just one feature of using multiple addresses.  Yet in your first comment, you said ALL features are wasted with consolidation.
The MAIN feature that is a *virtual requirement* for a merchant is identifying who paid.  You can't reliably identify who paid, without giving them different payment addresses.  
Privacy of the customers is not a feature that is a requirement, like identifying who paid is.

The bitcoin address is derived from the public key (which is derived from the private key). This answers your second question (no, they are not the same thing).    
When you spend money, you must divulge the public key, which does indeed reduce the amount of security you have.   And it reduces security by a HUGE factor.
But it's still quite secure, and uncrackable with state-of-the-art computers.
The main reason is for privacy, as others say, but don't underestimate the reduction of security!  It is a GIGANTIC reduction.

As others have said, any number would work fine, since they are sub-dividable.  But my theory is this:
Probably during the early design process, he penciled out a plan to have 21 Million, and subdivide them to two decimal places.  This fits very comfortable into a 32 bit integer, since the maximum number of a 32 bit integer is 2^31-1, or 2,147,483,647.  It also worked very well with the 50 Bitcoins every ten minutes for the first approx 4 years (210,000 blocks - again with the "21").
Later, when implemented, he went with larger integers, and much more sub-dividable, but he stuck with his earlier decisions, as it really doesn't matter.

So, to summarize, it could be very quick to look up addresses to see if they have ever been used, but it would require having access to a huge index.
This could be done by creating this huge index and storing it locally, or by hitting an index that has already been created, such as blockchain.info.
By doing so, we would detect the once-in-a-universe's-lifetime event of a collision, but also the weekly occurrence of someone reporting a self-inflicted collision.

I think the semi-official response is that if you trusted someone, and they borrow from you, that person owes you.
So my friend owes me.  His friend owes him.  The scammer owes the victim.  But what ends up happening is that the victim, who is out potentially 10 BTC in this case needs to decide if they are going to be a mini-scammer to everyone that they owe.  
If the scammer scams Grandma out of 10 BTC, and Grandma was trusted by each of her 10 descendants for 1 BTC, then each descendant gets stiffed by grandma, or grandma has to make good.  The kids feel sorry for grandma (maybe), and let her slide on the debt, and so the scammer really scammed someone distant.
Or worse, if I trusted grandma's descendant, the scammer is scamming me.  Grandma doesn't even see or know the person or people who are ultimately scammed, and shurgs.
it's possible that a 10 BTC scam gets diffused among very any people so that 1000 people are stiffed for .01 BTC each.  Each person at the end of the chain is saying "well, i can stiff my ten friends for .01, or I have to pay .1.

So you pick a giant random number, and then you do a mod 233 (i.e. limit-1) ... so now your answer is between 0 and 233; and then you add one to it (i.e. add(1)), so now it's from 1 to 234.

yes, changing the algorithm is the easy part.  getting a majority of the users to install an update is the hard part.
It is more of a social challenge than a technical challenge.  And since the vast majority of users and miners currently have a stake in the success in Bitcoin and a belief that the hard limit is a feature that increases the likelihood of success, it'd be a huge challenge.

Have you decided which exchange you are going to use?  Be aware that you can't get US Dollars out of Mt. Gox in any sort of timely manner, currently (unless you are in Europe, apparently).
Day-trading with coinbase might get expensive with the fees.  Bitstamp might be your best bet, as it has reasonable volume and reasonable fees.  CampBX isn't a bad choice, but they don't have a volume to keep the bid-ask spread tight.
It's hard to make money day-trading Bitcoin, primarily because of the bid/ask spread and slippage.  Try it on paper first, and you'll see what I mean.  There's a gap between what you can buy for, and what you can sell for.  That, plus the commission, plus the slippage means that every time you trade, you not only have to guess right, but it's like trying to beat the point spread with sports bets.  You have to guess right with about a 1.5% spread (well, it depends on how many bitcoins you are buying at a time).  
It's just REALLY hard to make money, when you have a "house edge" like that.

There was a study back in about March or May that said that 40% of online Bitcoin wallet services have failed in the past.  I can't put my finger on that study at the moment - and it's historical data; bitcoin has grown up quite a bit.   But it's something to concern yourself with.
There are risks with any money - just look at some of the troubles in other countries (like Cyprus) where, last month, the government simply confiscated roughly 40% of the money on deposit over 100,000 Euros.
With Bitcoins, if you trust someone else, your risks are that they are crooks, or that they get robbed.  Coinbase being pretty publicly known individuals, and funded by some major investors, is probably not going to run off with your money.
They take their bitcoins "on deposit", and store some online, and the vast majority offline in "cold storage".  Presumably they know how to do that well, so that they don't get robbed, so that one of their employees doesn't rob them, and so that they have multiple copies in case of a fire or something like that.
I think it's a reasonably safe assumption that they know how to do this better than the average novice.
It's not too hard to learn to protect them yourself, though, with paper wallets like bitaddress.org or offline wallets like Electrum or Armory.  If you get into Bitcoins at some serious amounts, it might be worth learning some other methods of protecting your wealth, and diversify the risk a little.

I'm not sure what kind of online broker you have, where you don't need to identify yourself, but that sounds sketchy.
If you are comfortable with an online broker, just sign up with coinbase.com and link it to your bank account and credit card, and you are ready to go. 
It might take a month before you can do "instant" transactions, but that's by far the easiest and least sketchy.  But it's not "private" (any more than e*trade is).

This could very well end up being near the end of 2015.
Consider the blocks generated in the last 4 months: block 240,000 was generated on 6/6.   The network has confirmed about 22,000 blocks in 4 months.  The 2 months prior, and the 2 months prior to that, only 10,000 blocks were confirmed.
Operating at the pace that we have over the last two months, the projected date for the block halving would be Feb 27, 2016, which would be a good conservative guess.
But if the network confirms at the pace of the last 1000 blocks, the halving event would be on **December 5, 2015**.

I'm curious as to how you would re-word the email, keeping in mind that it's a general email for all bounced transactions (on purpose, because you don't want to tip off fraudsters as to what triggers their fraud detection).  You have at least two cases, one where an account is potentially fraudulent (i.e. potentially a hacker has signed up with stolen bank credentials) and another where a transaction is potentially fraudulent (i.e. a long-time customer performs a transactions which heuristic analysis shows to be on the higher end of the probability scale of being fraudulent - in other words, a long-time customer's account has been hacked).
Theirs says (according to another post):


 


Now, keep in mind that it might be the case where they project how many bitcoins to buy for a day, and rate all transactions on the "likelihood of fraud" scale... so some days the cutoff might be more aggressive than other days.  (or maybe not days, maybe hours...)
Note, I'm not a total Coinbase nut.  They have their flaws, no doubt.  But they really are about as good as I have seen in several years of Bitcoin experience.  So I'm all for making them better in a constructive manner.  I just get annoyed with the cry-babies who want to immediately sue.

Sorry to hear that your business partners are tired.  
There's a lot of up-side, and not a lot of down-side.  You can get the bitcoins converted to dollars immediately.  Coinbase has a great deal going on right now, that costs next to nothing for that right.  You also get some free press, and possibly some support from the Bitcoin community.

Also, if you are looking for meta tags in HTML, you have to guard against someone changing the bitcoin address on people's profiles (either by attacking Twitter, or by attacking someone's PC which updates Twitter).  It wouldn't be obvious to the user that their address had been changed.
And you also have to guard against man-in-the-middle attacks on your server.  If you look up the address, and get Joe Evil's address instead, you won't know it.  You may want to use SSL.

You can generally expect a better experience from coinbase (if you are from the US), especially once you are confirmed, but at the expense of a slightly higher price.

First, don't transfer the full $20K to campbx prior to purchase, letting it sit there waiting for theft.
Second, set up 2-factor authentication on CampBX, and a hard password.
Third, get set up on CampBX with your ID, so you know you can withdraw.
Fourth, transfer a small amount that you don't mind losing, as a "training expense".  Maybe $25 or so.  Buy some bitcoins, and practice getting them to "cold storage".  I think  is your best option there, if you create a paper wallet or a brain wallet completely "off the internet".  In other words, load the bitaddress.org webpage in private browsing, then turn off your wireless and unplug your internet cable (while retaining access to your printer, so maybe unplug it at your router).  Then create a paper wallet (or a few), print them, and reboot your PC. 
Fifth, send the money to the paper wallet, and then practice recovering it.  Transfer it back to CampBX, or to another wallet.  Make sure you understand the mechanics.
THEN you will feel more comfortable risking $20K.
Personally, I would suggest spreading the purchases over a longer period and over multiple websites, if you are in the US.  The US likes to know about things 10K and greater.  So spend $9900 on CampBX and another $9900 on Coinbase.

coinbase buys from exchanges, so they are sort of a 'retail' shop, compared to exchanges being wholesale (in a way).
With Exchanges, you are simply entering a virtual room full of people shouting out bids and asking prices.  Exchanges take place when bidders like the asking price and vice versa.
With Exchanges, if you want to buy now, you usually need to pay the lowest asking price.  If you want to sell now, you usually need to select the highest bid.
Buying or selling a lot of Bitcoins will require you to work with different sellers or buyers, and so the price can change.
Mt Gox is hard to withdraw US Dollars from, so people don't like to sell and end up with USD, so the price is higher to reflect that.

I'm with you.  I don't see a government adopting Bitcoin any time soon.  You lay out the reasons why a government may not want to.
What I CAN envision happening is that the volatility of Bitcoin becomes much less (think 10 to 30 years from now), that it's similar to national currencies.  
I can also envision the PEOPLE moving primarily to Bitcoin (again, 10 to 30 years from now) because of its stability and deflationary nature.  Governments don't have much benefit to switching; they lose control.  Citizens do.  And so bitcoin could become the de facto national currency, or preferred currency in a country, even if the government resists it.  
And eventually, people change their governments.  It takes time, but I think it's possible.  But definitely not anytime soon!

The problem is that most of them prove to be right and wrong at the same time, because they lack any specifics.  Point by point:


So increased volatility.  That could be measured, given some specifics.  Like increased compared to what?  And is this daily volatility (perhaps measured by (daily high)/(daily low)).  So perhaps we would measure the daily volatility on all the days between the first date that Gox breaks $166 until it trades at $266, and do a fact check, comparing it to the average volatility of the 30 previous days.


OK, is this the $200 to $1000 zone?  Or the $200 - $205 zone?   How do you define unstable?  That it will cross $200 back and forth more times than it's crossed other numbers?   Perhaps we look at all the integer prices between $166 and $199, and check the average amount of times it's crossed back (i.e. a trade less than the integer that immediately followed a trade greater than that same integer).  That could measure "stability" at $200.  We could look at 201, 202, 203, etc., as well.


So.. this sounds like he expects that there will be a long time between when it first trades at $250 (or, say above $249.80), and then it actually trades above $250.  And then compare that to other milestones, like, say $150, and $200, to see if it was "major" resistance, or just typical resistance.


Rises and falls of 10-30% daily.  I think this is clear, although it doesn't say for how long.  But I would compare the closing price (midnight price UTC) day-over-day (for some period) to see if each day fluctuated by 10-30%.


So it will go to $1000 with no difficulty.  hmmm  Not sure how to measure that to see if this prediction is correct, but we could probably come up with a method.


Ah, ok, the counter argument, so he can be right either way.  (sigh)

I'm no expert on Multibit, but I believe that the Multibit password is protecting your encrypted wallet.  That's how BitcoinQT works as well.  So yes, someone would have to have your wallet file and try to crack it.
You can bet that there are plenty of wallet grabbing viruses out there.  And if you email your wallet, or store it on Drop Box or something, someone may find it.  So your biggest risk is that someone would capture your wallet, and then try to brute-force it.  And so you are probably in pretty good shape with a reasonably long password (12+ characters and not words and not a phrase).
If you have a significant amount of money in Bitcoin, you should probably move it to cold storage - a paper wallet is an easy way to do this.
But overall, personally, I wouldn't have a problem storing a few bitcoins in the  setup you described.

BitcoinAverage is flawed because it factors in Mt. Gox, which is not a valid Exchange Rate for quick conversion.  Edit: OK there's an "ignore Mt. Gox" button.
It should be a weighted average of the sites that allow exchange to the currency within a reasonably timely fashion.
Right now it's like taking all the real-time dollar to euro exchanges, and factoring in one giant savings and loan into the equation.  "Come here and convert your dollars to Euros.... we give you the highest rate, and give you your converted currency sometime between 12 weeks from now and, maybe never."
Sorry, Gox doesn't count, even if they are huge.  They are **not** an ["exchange"]( in the sense of being able to, you know, exchange money.

I think it's still a silly argument even if you pay with USD, as you hint at.
You can hold dollars, hold bitcoins, or buy a mining machine.  When you buy a mining machine, whether you pay in dollars or bitcoins, you are paying a certain value at the time of purchase.  The thing that is mildly predictable is the production rate of the bitcoins it mines.  It's much less predictable to take that prediction and compound it with a currency conversion prediction.
So, when evaluating the right price for a bitcoin mining machine, predict how many coins it will produce over time, and deduct a little for the risk and pain-in-the-ass factor (and add a little for the pleasure of the hobby if you wish), and you have a price in bitcoins.  Convert that to dollars at today's rate, subtract the very predictable price of electricity in dollars, and you have a price that you shouldn't exceed.

Just to be clear, I was talking about spreading the risk and keeping under the radar, not structuring or tax evasion.
I agree, there's nothing illegal about buying Bitcoins and didn't mean to imply that.  I have bought significantly more than $10K, but never in chunks larger than about $7500.  And I have (and will) comply with tax and reporting requirements, and would suggest others do the same.

Bitcoin is already trading $5 million per day, so 1 millionth of the Forex volume you quoted. 
But it could trade much more, without the price going up.  In fact, the day SR closed, it traded a lot more than $5 million, but the price went down.

So basically, you'd need a "shared message store" like Bitmessage has, where product offerings were housed.  To list a product for sale, you'd upload a photo (or several), plus the critical facts, into a message that would get stored for some time, and bounced around the P2P network.
A shopper would start the program and receive the "catalog" of available products.  The client software would help categorize all the listings, and provide a good shopping experience, while the messages are basically just ugly-raw info with photos.  Database entries, if you will.
The buying would be facilitated just like SR - escrow, pay with Bitcoins, submit your ship-to info into a message that also is P2P.
The vendor would see the purchase, and ship the merchandise.
The ratings would be based on completed transactions, messages that are signed by the recipient.  (This could be rigged, but so can any ratings system, with fake buyers.)

My single suggestion to reduce customer integration costs is to design an API that is as plug-compatible to Paypal as possible.    If I could just change paypal to bitpay in all code, and be up and running, that would be so cool.
Obviously their process is different, and paypal sucks, but a lot of people have that figured out.  Oh, and they have several different interfaces, which adds to the challenge.  (I'm talking about the interface where you put everything in your cart on the customer's server, and then get hotlinked over to paypal to complete the payment stuff, and then in the background, the server gets an async notification of payment as a notice to fulfill the order.)

I like the idea.  I would suggest extending it beyond monthly, making the payment date a little more flexible.  (For instance, if I get paid every other Friday, or the 1st and the 16th, I may want "automatic payments" on those dates.)
I'm not sure how you are implementing it.  Maybe you are preparing the transaction in advance, and signing it right then, but only releasing it to the network at a later date.  (This method wouldn't work so well for indefinitely recurring payments, and could get you in a situation where the bitcoins were already spent, but it seems safer for getting the user's approval, when you know the user has been authenticated.)
If you wait until x-date before you create the transaction and release it to the network, that has pros and cons.  1)  The user must be running the app on that day.  2) you should authenticate the user.
Or perhaps you are creating a timed transaction and releasing it immediately in some way, taking advantage of some Bitcoin protocol feature.  This seems like a bad thing to me - as it would lock the coins from either address accessing them.
In summary, I see the issues as:
1)  Scheduling flexibility     
2)  User Authentication at the time of the transaction creation     
3)  Making sure the app is on, to send the transaction on the given day (or potentially missing the deadline - bad for routine utility bill payments!)     
4)  Avoiding double-spending the coins for which the transaction was created.

I must not be communicating well.  I am NOT saying that it's low volatility. I am saying it is lowER.
Yeah, this is no where near low volatility, I agree.   But the trend is in the right direction.  Case in point is the SR bust causing a quick (15 minute) drop of about 30%, with an immediate bounce back up to reclaim half of that, and a one week climb to reclaim the other half.
Compare that to even April 10, where the drop was from 266 to 50 (an 81% drop).  Or to 2011, when the drop was from 32 to 4 (an 88% drop).  
But really, if you do a statistical analysis of the daily volatility (high price / low price), or weekly, or monthly, you can see that it is easing its way downward (although even this is a bit choppy, as there are periods of "relative" calm).  
so, not low volatility.  Simply lower now than six months ago, and significantly (orders of magnitude)  lower than 2011.

The problem most people make (looking at your scenario) is that they think "long password" is good enough.  Now, a multibit password is different than a brainwallet, so you may be ok.
But MANY long brainwallet passphrases have already been cracked.  For instance, I cracked the stupidly simple "these are not the droids you're looking for" (which contained 1 satoshi, which I left there, but it has since been claimed).
Any phrase that appears in books, movies, songs, or online should not be used.   [Google provides a list of "n-grams"]( like 8-grams are lists of the most common 8-word terms that appear online.  And so taking that list of n-grams and creating a list of the brain wallets from those and watching all those addresses is really trivial. I'm sure "these are not the droids you're looking for" appears on Google's list of 8-grams.
I suspect that your multibit "long password" protects a file that is local to your machine (as opposed to brain wallets which protect bitcoins that are available to all, without having a separate file).  So you may be ok.  But the "long password" would be the concern that I would have, given the way you described your setup.

Liz, I really like this presentation.
Here's another thing I would take issue with:


I think the word "all" is misleading.
Here's why.  Let's say I have a paper wallet with an address that starts with 1a...  Say I fund it with two transactions, one of 3 BTC and another of 100 BTC.
Now, the blockchain identifies that there are 2 unspent outputs in "1a...".
OK, so if I go to blockchain.info and import the private key (not sweep) of "1a...", and I pay 1 BTC to a friend at "1b...".  Say my blockchain.info change address is "1c....".
The transaction that gets executed will (likely) be a spend of ONE of the unspent outputs (the 3 BTC one), sending 1 BTC to "1b..." and 2 BTC to "1c".  At this point, I STILL have 100 BTC in "1a..."
Using your statement that "all" of my BTC have been moved, I would think that "1c..." has 102 BTC.  But it doesn't.
(correct me if I am wrong.)

Separating the passphrase from the paper wallet would be good extra security.

I am working to make bitcoin successful - not just buy and hold.   But don't get me wrong, I think that passive investors are a very big part of making Bitcoin successful.  So I encourage others to buy and hold as well (but only what they are willing to lose entirely).
I am in for the ride - for the long term.  Here's the vision I have:  Someday when you say "I have 25 bitcoins" (or whatever number), people won't stop and do the math.  "hm, let's see, 25 x $200... he has about $5000")  Instead, Bitcoins will have a recognized value - recognized by many people.  And your 25 bitcoins won't be "valued at $5000" in people's minds.  They will inherently recognize that 25 bitcoins is a lot.
It's sort of like when you learn a foreign language.  In the first year, you hear the other language and you translate it in your head, to English.  Then you think of an English response, and translate it in your head.  But eventually, you learn to hear, think, and speak in the foreign language, without the translation.
When that day comes, with Bitcoin, then I'll feel that "we" have been successful.  When a lot of people get paid in bitcoin, leave money in bitcoin, and spend in bitcoin, without even thinking of fiat, that's what I look forward to.  Then, I won't "get out" and move to fiat.  I'll just spend a little more freely my Bitcoins.

"We'd like a steady 7% growth."
I don't know who "we" is, but it does not include me.  The total amount of wealth invested in Bitcoins has been rising pretty steadily at 18.7% *per month* for more than 20 months.
There are going to be deviations that pull us away from that rate, but it historically has returned with the lows getting higher as time goes on.
Bubbles are what you'd expect as the value rises several orders of magnitude.
If "we'd" like a certain growth rate, "we" can sell to keep the price constrained.

Yep.  I sincerely hope that you are rewarded greatly for your mistake!  I believe you will be.  
Then again, I'm in it for the long haul.  One week one direction or the other isn't a big deal to me.

set up a spreadsheet.  Track your purchases and your sales.  Your gains (or losses) are the difference.  That's what you need to pay tax on.
If you maintain proper records and report it as honestly as possible, you are unlikely to run into problems with audits, etc.
Be careful with being a money exchange, though.  Stay under the FinCEN limits.

Google says a couple thousand dollars for a million Chilean pesos is not an excellent deal.  You are over-paying.

Answer:  No.
@_date: 2013-09-17 19:35:04
no... I'd probably just google looking for some hints and help.
There was a greasemonkey script mentioned in the bitcointalk forum for just-dice, and that's how I learned it (well... I didn't have to learn very much, since I already know javascript).
Of course, the whole premise of this topic and script was that you could automate gambling (which sounds like a horrible idea).. but it was a good way to learn greasemonkey.

Agreed!  Currencies extend far beyond the algorithm.  They are networks of people, users, merchants, miners, and exchanges, in addition to algorithms.
Someday - maybe 100 years from now - something will come along to challenge Bitcoin, but for now, there's nothing to indicate that any alt-coin has a chance of matching Bitcoin's network.

"No, they're green, and their green.
"Well, you seem smart.  Do you have any idea why that man was standing by the pond with a pole?"    
"Two fish, or perhaps just to fish."

The Tea Party has a lot of commonality with Libertarianism, and I personally know several very close (and a dozen distant) Libertarians who felt that the best way to affect political change in the Libertarian direction was (several years ago) to back the Tea Party movement.  These were Ron (and Rand) Paul supporters.
What the party has evolved to lately... not sure... but every one of those people that I can think of are still very active in the Tea Party.  
Smaller Government, "Hands off" government, no  entitlements (or certainly no more), reduced taxes, larger freedoms, less regulation... all those things were Tea Party selling points that align well with Libertarian views.

With Bitcoin only being 58 months old, 30 days of no bad news means that the protocol is almost 2% older and more tested.
So yes.  (although 2% doesn't equate to 2x...., it does imply some increased stability.)

If you look at the [1670 BTC hit transaction]( you'll see 3 inputs of just over 500 BTC.
I suspect that when he tumbled the bitcoins, he withdrew amounts just over 500 BTC as his stash.  You can probably trace back from this transaction, and look for other 500+ BTC accounts that were created from common transactions.  And then you may be able to find his stash.
It's possible that it's nowhere near 600,000 BTC though, as that's a prosecutor number, and I am inclined not to believe it.  He had expenses, after all.  And Bitcoins weren't worth much for the vast majority of the time SR was run, so he'd have to cash bigger chunks to make payroll and other expenses.
What will be interesting, is if someone finds a collection of 500+ BTC accounts, and attacks the encryption, under the assumption that these accounts have similar passphrases.

Man, I'm sorry to hear that.  I feel for you.
Hopefully this won't sour you on Bitcoin completely.  I guess start over with a small purchase.  But be aware... on Gox, there's some kind of programmatic access that they may have enabled, so even if you change your password, he may have access somehow.  Look at all the security settings.  And add two factor for anything significant (like withdrawals or programmatic access).  
I may not be describing the programmatic access very well (API), but I know it's been a source of vulnerabilities.  That's because the crooks can let their computers run day and night probing the api.
You might be better off setting up a new account, on a known clean PC, and securing it from the start.

Despite the fact that some people think of Satoshi as the Messiah, he doesn't define laws or morality.
If you happen to guess or know a combination to a locker, it gives you access to, but not legal or moral right to, its contents.

In your article, you should mention the big catalyst being the surpassing of a market cap of $10B.  "Once the price hit about $830, the market capitalization of all Bitcoins currently in existence were $10B, opening up the possibility of major trusts, mutual funds, endowments and retirement accounts investing in Bitcoin.  Many of them have limits in their charters, restricting the trustees to investing in assets with capitalization greater than $10B or greater.  This passing of $830 happened less than one week ago, and then the price immediately shot past the $1300 mark."
