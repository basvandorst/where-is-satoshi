My argument was that excessive debt becomes a drain on the economy because you either have to finance it through more deficit spending or by raising taxes. Basically, the only people who benefit from those astronomical debt payments ($300 billion + in the USA alone now) are the super wealthy buyers of govt debt. 
Also, the real inflation numbers are in all likelihood much higher than reported because as we get bigger and bigger efficiency gains, instead of that being passed onto consumers through lower prices, consumer goods stay roughly the same in price, thus masking the inflation. Furthermore, there is huge inflation in some essential areas, namely housing, health care, and education. We aren't at hyper inflation levels for sure, but lets not pretend that excessive debt is good for the economy.

Japan has had a mostly stagnant economy for the past 30 years though. People work like crazy and are barely above water. They even invented a word that means death by overwork. They are only able to sustain the weight of their debt on the backs of their workforce.

One piece of advice, don’t let random alts mooning make you fomo into them. Just stick with bitcoin and after you’ve been in the space for a year or so and have absorbed a lot of info, then go ahead and diversify.

It’s not like it isn’t a problem though. Close to $300bln a year is paid in interest every year, which is just crazy.

Net neutrality was not one of those red tape regulations that libertarians loathe. It was a policy that prevented internet traffic discrimination. Now isps can throttle connections to specific websites or open up fast lanes for preferred websites, because of ajit.

And bitcoin could just hardfork to add extra decimal places if necessary.

The blockchain might be the most important computer technology ever created, but I'd still consider vaccines, antibiotics, electricity, automobiles, rockets, and nuclear energy more revolutionary.

Google glass is a bad analogy. Even though it wasn't a *consumer* success, it found a strong use case on factory and warehouse floors. Also, it was the first real attempt at AR/MR, and future attempts will keep on getting better until one comes along that pinpoints the magic mixture of price and UX. Just look at VR, it's been around since the 80's and yet it wasn't until Oculus came around that someone was able to make it consumer friendly. 
At this point in Bitcoin's life, I highly doubt that Bitcoin will die a slow and uneventful death. Over time it is getting more and more battle-tested and resilient. Every day it chugs along without incident, it proves its hardness and reliability. Bitcoin is the backbone propping up the entirety of the crypto space. And if you don't think *crypto* has a future, then maybe you just haven't realized how important it truly is to humanity.

You are ok with them telling you how you spend *your* money?

Are we on r/Buttcoin? The comments here are pissing me the fuck off.  
THE WHOLE REASON FOR BITCOIN'S EXISTENCE IS BECAUSE BANKERS AND THE FINANCIAL ELITE HAVE BEEN FUCKING OVER SOCIETY FOR THEIR BENEFIT THROUGH CONCENTRATION OF WEALTH AND POWER AND THUS GOVERNANCE AND MONETARY POLICY.   
Do you want monetary sovereignty and hard money, or do you want perpetually inflated fiat in which you are under constant surveillance and control by your (hopefully benign -- but probably not) government? If you want the latter or don't mind it, what are you even doing here???

Fungible Bitcoin makes other privacy coins redundant overnight. Great job Wasabi wallet team. The dream will be realized when we get Schnoor and Tap/Graft Root. Compound that with LN and we will give the surveillance state a big F U.

He’s talking about the token taxonomy act which would ease some of the capital gains tax reporting (no tax on purchases under $600), allow crypto to crypto trades be tax free and clarify tokens status regarding if they are securities or not. Also, it would seek to have a common framework across all states, which would hopefully end the bitlicense. This isn’t some socialist here coming to take your bidcones.

If you want more private bitcoins get Wasabi!

Yup. The toxic members of the old guard need to go.

So if there is a vast network of cryptos on lightning, it would be less so one crypto being transferred to another, but rather the value they represent? 
If that is true, and you see a “bitcoin accepted here” sign, you could hook up your litecoin to LN and transfer them the desired BTC? 
@_date: 2019-01-06 10:22:48
I like btc and it is the majority of my hodlings but it isn’t a smart contract platform, isn’t a privacy coin, and will require the LN to scale. BTC is the best HARD money, for sure. But if over-financialization leads to rampant rehypothecation, it might lose some of that quality through an artificial supply, which is arguably already happening with the cme futures and its paper bitcoins. 
Anyway, stop being a maximalist. Even if/when btc gets world reserve currency status, there will still be a huge variety of fiat money and tons of other altcoins, with a few of them not being shitcoins. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 09:53:45
There will be one world reserve cryptocurrency (bitcoin), but there will be other coins that fill different niches.

Just because you put in an overpriced buy order doesn’t mean it will be filled at that price. You’d have to eat through all the sell orders to pump it that high...

IIRC they actually do stuff with the funds, so while btc dropped ~80%, Greyscale GBTC didn’t drop as hard.

Nooo, you are wrong blockstream core censoring maximalists. The one true bitcoin is made by satoshi himself, bitcoin cash satoshis vision.
