It seems a bit similar to social transactions at [GreenAddress.it](
You can send from GreenAddress.it's wallets to anyone over Facebook, email, and Reddit (Twitter coming soon). Then they receive an encrypted private key which can be redeemed on GreenAddress.it, or other wallets.
Also you can receive funds by sharing a 'Receive' link.
GreenAddress.it is maybe not as polished for this particular use case, but I think might be worth checking out as well.

We use 2of2 as opposed to 2of3, because we think it is even better for security: even if your backup is compromised, there is no 3rd key which could be used for stealing funds.
You have a good point about losing the private key, but that is why we have developed Gentle! See [FAQ]( about 'what happens if your service goes away'
(from FAQ:) We provide nLockTime transactions which essentially make deposits 'expire' after some time, which allows redeeming them without our intervention after this pre-set period of time.
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:34:02
Good point the private key can be stolen, but note they also do server-side checks for each transaction, which gives you additional security in the case of stolen key.
EDIT: I think I didn't realise you meant the server can steal your keys, not some third-party attacker. This is true, and can be improved by providing the client code as an open source browser extension. We [plan to do this]( at GreenAddres.it.

Currently all transactions, including to your own addresses, require two factor authentication, if enabled. Rate limiting and limits are still to be implemented.


When we implement these limits, you will be able to bypass them using two factor authentication. BTW, long term we also plan to do some additional anti-fraud checks to detect unusual transactions/locations/tor etc., and require some additional wallet validation in such cases.
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:38:12
I think throw1212's point is that actually the server can steal your private key, so in case of compromised server, using a more secure browser is not going to help here.
It could help with securing your keys against attackers targeting your browsing machine though.

This post mentions some new cryptographic technique of doing multisignature threshold signatures, which isn't available publicly as far as I can see, and also see two posts below: 'The threshold sig stuff sounds pretty far along' - so we might not see it anytime soon.

Hi! I'm a developer at GreenAddress.it, so if you have any technical questions, feel free to ask here.
@_date: 2014-03-18 20:03:55
It is true, nLockTime can be used to steal your funds.
However, you are expected to re-deposit funds before they expire. Currently you have roughly (depending on how quick blocks are generated) 12 hours to do this since you receive the "deposits expired" email.
It can still be improved and we plan to make the email notification time frame larger/customisable. 
Also we plan to implement 'automatic re-deposit' feature allowing you to pre-sign a re-deposit transaction with nLockTime smaller than the 'expiring nLockTime', so you can have additional nLockTime number of bloks to wait until any manual action is required.

Same here, we've started almost a year ago. :) I've just found [our first production multisig deposit]( in case someone is interested.
@_date: 2014-04-05 14:46:48
We already do it! :) See in the whitepaper: "Please note that the 2 factor authentication where possible includes transaction or change request information within the 2FA message so as to make some MITM attacks more easily caught by the user before authorizing transactions or settings change."
2FA cannot be used for transactions other than the one for which the code was requested.
However, I imagine a malicious code could be specifically crafted to intercept your email, in which case you don't get the chance to check the transaction details. Hence we suggest using a different device for 2FA.
EDIT: formatting
@_date: 2014-03-18 22:08:49
Correct, we are not storing users' keys at all. Keys for our side of multisig are held by us and not by users. This gives the security benefits of 2FA because only we can sign the 2nd part of 2-of-2.
Also this allows us to implement in future additional instant transaction confirmations before the blockchain confirmations, for trusted quick transactions protected from double spending.
@_date: 2014-03-15 19:07:17
Sorry about BitFast, he's once admitted himself he's an arrogant asshole. ;)
We've just fixed that for you, please take a look. It now works without localStorage, though it is not as snappy as when you have localStorage enabled. 
Unfortunately without localStorage we can't offer the PIN functionality for storing your encrypted private key locally. If you still want that, I imagine we could implement storage using a bookmark in your browser with ' URL for quick login. Would that interest you?
@_date: 2014-03-09 01:51:34
While it is true we aim to provide trust-based zero confirmation transactions, please note this is not the only advantage of our wallet, and you don't have to trust its "greenaddressness" to use it.
The trust is required only for quickness of transactions, and all other blockchain and cryptographic properties of Bitcoin transactions still apply. This is because we use 2of2 addresses which require users' signatures to spend, so even taking control of our keys doesn't mean the funds can be stolen.
@_date: 2014-03-18 20:28:27
We store our private key on a single Amazon EC2 server, to which only our founder, tech lead, and obviously some EC2 engineers have access. It is also backed up encrypted in separate locations.
When we grow, we plan to create a new more secure key stored at some dedicated server secured with full-disk encryption.
If you have 2FA set up, the only way to steal your funds given safe server is to compromise the 2FA. So for example one attack vector is if you stay logged in to your email, then the attacker could intercept emails with authentication codes. More secure authentication is coming soon, i.e. a robot phone call.
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:12:14
Very good question - thanks! We use the draft standard [BIP-0039]( for generating mnemonics, and accepted standard [BIP-0032]( for generating your keys from the seed. Unfortunately currently the only thing that you can export from our application is the mnemonic, which cannot be imported easily into other software without writing some custom code based on the above BIPs, but we do plan to implement such tool in the future. Maybe an Electrum plugin, as [Electrum supports plugins](
That said, note our wallets require our second signature to redeem funds, so just exporting the private keys is not going to allow you to use them. To address this issue we plan to provide nLockTime transactions to our users which allow getting funds back after some preset time in case something bad happens to us.

Hi. I'm one of greenaddress.it developers. We try to consider every aspect of Bitcoin protocol carefully, which includes malleability. We should be immune to these issues, because we don't rely on transaction hashes for tracking transactions, and we do not assume memory pool transactions are final. That said, we still assume we can make mistakes, so our 2-signatures-centered design means users don't have to trust us with their money.

Great to see more people are interested in multisig wallets! Have you seen [GreenAddress.it]( It doesn't include exchange functionalities for now, but it is a 2of2 P2SH wallet with two factor authentication for transactions. We've recently rewritten our first implementation which was based on plain multisig without P2SH (see [Internet Archive]( so I could perhaps claim is was us who did the first multisig wallet, but I wouldn't be surprised to see others trying even earlier than us! ;)
@_date: 2014-03-18 17:08:43
Don't worry about asking question, it is quite confusing.
Yes, transaction signatures explicitly sign the txnID. As you can see in the PNG you've provided, ECDSA_CheckSignature is done on verifyThisStr which contains TxCopy.serialize(), which in turn contains TxIn0, TxIn1, ... - those are the previous outputs which are spent.
In our nLockTime case we have a single previous output - the nLockTime-protected transaction, which can change due to malleability.
However, we re-do the nLockTime transactions in case malleability happens, so you should receive another email with a new nLockTime tx in such case.

We have developed a sort-of-new kind of a web wallet. [It was proposed back in 2013 by Gavin Andresen - see this link for more details.](
Its main feature is that we do not store users' keys on our servers, and at the same time we provide server-side checks for transactions made by users. This allows doing per-transaction two-factor authentication, limits, and delayed transactions, to name a few advantages.
GreenAddress.it signs each transaction with its own key in addition to client-side signing by user's keys, and funds are stored in 2-of-2 multisignature outputs. The drawback of it is that you cannot control your funds without GreenAddress.it's signature.
We have solved this issue by providing nLockTime transactions which essentially make deposits 'expire' after some time, which allows redeeming them without our intervention after this pre-set period of time.
This allows you to keep your ease of mind even in case GreenAddress.it disappears with its keys.
@_date: 2014-03-18 20:37:11
The device is identified by a unique identifier which is stored in the device's local storage. Device does submit the PIN along with the identifier, and receives a password back.
We currently don't have any hardware wallets support, but we're discussing with various vendors including hardware wallets.
If you have PIN and the device with the encrypted mnemonic, you can do anything you could do with the mnemonic, because it allows decrypting it. This includes checking the balance and sending transactions with 2FA.
In case you wanted simpler read-only access for checking your balance, you can use third-party login like Facebook or Reddit linked to your account.

Gaittip uses [GreenAddress.it]( wallets for tipping as opposed to bitcointip-controlled wallets.
This means gaittip doesn't control tippers' funds.
It also sends tips to one-time private keys which means recipients are free to redeem them simply using any WIF format-compatible wallet.

Hmm, word not recognised sounds like you perhaps tried entering the BIP38-encrypted key in our login form? I think the 'BIP38 sweep and login' title might be confusing here.
To sweep a BIP38 key you need to create a GreenAddress wallet, and then sweep it *after* logging in inside the 'Receive Money' page.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:49:00
It is sort of like blockchain, but we aim to provide a more secure solution by not storing even encrypted users’ wallets, instead relying on Electrum-like seed which is based on hierarchical deterministic wallets in our case.
Also we only use P2SH and each transaction is covered by two signatures, one from you and one from us actioned by you via 2 factor authentication. This also allows instant 0-confirmations greenaddress transactions.
@_date: 2014-03-01 23:15:04
According to [this commit]( Electrum indeed implements the same standards as of Feb 1st. However, while it's possible to import [*], there are two reasons why it won't work:
 * transaction would still require a second signature,
 * Electrum uses [different hdwallet branches]( than we do.
Anyway we'll be looking into some integration either for nLockTime transaction coming from GreenAddress.it and/or integrating GreenAddress.it support for day to day transactions into Electrum.
In general we love Electrum and would love to support it.
[*] I couldn't resist and I've actually just verified it with a hacked copy of Electrum's latest source and the public key hashes do match after importing GreenAddress.it mnemonic - see  for a geeky screenshot. ;)

We've just released an initial beta of [GreenAddress.it]( - it's an easy multisig (2of2) web wallet, which allows users to keep control of their funds in paper wallets, while providing server-side benefits of two factor authentication, social transactions, and more.
@_date: 2014-03-02 19:55:13
Blockchain.info's two factor auth provides additional security for retrieving your encrypted private keys from their servers. On the other hand, two factor authentication in multisig wallets is done on per-transaction basis, so even if someone intercepts your private keys, they cannot steal your BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:30:17
I think it is more secure, because it uses one-time tokens for each transaction, as opposed to Blockchain.info which uses 2FA only for fetching the encrypted wallet, in which case funds can be stolen without the additional server-side verification, given just the user's private key.
It is also worth checking out [GreenAddress.it]( which uses P2SH like BitGo, but 2of2 as opposed to 2of3, which I think is even better for security, because even if your backup is compromised, there is no 3rd key which could be used for stealing funds.
@_date: 2014-04-05 15:34:36
After your nLockTime recovery transaction for old outputs becomes valid, due to the security reasons above, the funds need to be swept into new outputs with new nLockTime.
We call this re-depositing because you essentially sign a new transation which 'withdraws' your funds and 'deposits' them again into new P2SH outputs. This relocks the funds in 2of2 until the new time locked transaction expires.
@_date: 2014-04-05 15:01:53
The idea we're thinking about would be based on the user pre-signing a number of re-depositing transactions in advance.
Then we would provide a number of nLockTime transactions for each of the 'advance re-deposits', which can be used in case GreenAddress is down and doesn't use those re-reposits.
@_date: 2014-03-18 21:38:55
True, Google Authenticator code can be intercepted by malware while it is being set up. SMS/email from a safe separate device still might not be safe though. An attack might be actually possible if the attacker sent a request to enable email/SMS with a different email/phone number at the same moment you were sending such request, stopping your request from being send, so you would think 2FA is enabled while it would be enabled with a different email or phone number!
Basically if the client is hacked you can't trust what you see, you can't trust anything.
@_date: 2014-03-18 18:57:18


Yes, you need your mnemonic passphrase secured and backed up.


If you lose the mnemonic passphrase you lost your funds, we do not hold that information for security purposes.


The nLockTimes are currently generated only after making a new transaction, but we plan to do that beforehand and verify client-side that they are signed properly. Our [open source]( [Chrome App]( connects to the Electrum network to verify that all blockchain data from the server is accurate and verifies that the P2SH is with a key controlled by GreenAddress.it (meaning even if fully compromised they won't be able to lock your funds with a different key than ours, at most they could block nlocktime signatures but your client would detect that too.)


Can you clarify the question? If you mean how does the PIN work, we store an AES ancrypted mnemonic on your device, and a 256-bit password on our server, which is retrieved from the server on PIN login, but is removed after 3 failed attempts.


You can display the mnemonic using a button on the bottom of 'Settings'.


There should be no risk, as long as you have your mnemonic backed up. You can still log in using your mnemonic without the PIN and create a new PIN.
If someone intercepts your device with PIN, they still won't be able to make transactions if you have 2FA set up.


We remove the AES password from our database. You will not be able to log in again using this PIN.

It's different from malleability. The nLockTime transactions are not broadcasted, they are provided to users over separate channels (email, and we plan Dropbox/Google Drive). In case of such need, these transactions need to be broadcasted manually after nLockTime passes.

As far as I know, currently the only implementation for converting GreenAddress.it's mnemonics into relevant private keys is [Gentle]( It's [open sourced on GitHub](
The current Gentle implementation requires a nLockTime JSON which we send automatically over email if you have a GreenAddress.it wallet with email two factor and notifications enabled.
Gentle's JavaScript could be easily changed not to require the JSON in addition to mnemonics, but you cannot use these private keys for multisig anyway without additional GreenAddress.it's signature for 2of2, so I'm not sure if that would be useful. nLockTime transactions are pre-signed by us, so you can redeem funds after the pre-set expiration time. It's a safety measure against us disappearing with our keys (which is unlikely).
It's odd you can't access GreenAddress.it from China. We see some active visitors from China, so it doesn't seem like a problem with the country. Have you tried changing your DNS settings or using a proxy?
@_date: 2014-03-16 02:15:20
The mnemonic is never sent to the server.

Good question!
However, we do not use 128-bit Electrum seeds. We only use Electrum servers to verify transactions. Basically we just fetch unspent outputs from Electrum servers to give users peace of mind that our server doesn't fake them to steal funds.
We chose Electrum because they are trusted in the community and provide good infrastructure for "thin Bitcoin clients" like ours.
Anyway, we use 256-bit [BIP39]( seeds for our 512-bit extended HD wallet keypairs, [as advised by BIP32](
