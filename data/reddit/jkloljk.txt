still worth it. 11-20k for recovery is ridiculous. 2k will get your shit back and you can enjoy the weekend

you must not be in the network security world. i'd pay if i was in his situation. sometimes you get a nail in your tire bro

That is true hoever, these ransomware companies made a promise and they always keep it. Don't ask me how i know :(
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:01:47
sometimes you gotta pay the ransom
you can literally call them and ask them how to get bitcoin lol
i'll take 5k for 2500 worth of btc if you pay me back in monero
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:15:03

Yep.. My friends that I've been getting to buy bitcoin were freaking out. I'm here, chillin, in my gazebo thinking of how crazy it has been 
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:18:46
No.  Buy now. The dips are gone

Christmas Crash. We'll look upon this next year on our yatch saying "Savage 2017" was rough
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:24:09
Haha amazing. At the lowest of 12k.. I got sweaty, palm spaghetti, accidentally put cayenne in my neti
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:01:41
I'm down to help get this going with you. Alot of BTC holders are great people like me and you. It's amazing that this is happening to such a great set of folks. A bunch of millionaire do gooders

It seems fucking bottom right now. I'd buy any crypto at this ridiculous low price. Don't mind me though, HODL 4 LYFE (while taking some money out as needed) 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:51:58
I love every one of you guys. Today we lose money but grow wiser. Be calm, crypto on. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:34:42
Good investing is buying high and selling low. Some has made a furtune. I hope you do well
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:21:51
I accidently sent myself a half a bitcoin thinking it was going into my bch wallet. I lost 100 bucks in transaction but glad I made that mistake 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:46:41
I've hodl since 2013. Don't worry about us bro. We continued making money in real life and withdraw as needed
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:20:13
I was just thinking this today. Such a time to become zen and watch it unfold. I see the market is on its way back up. Fear no more 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:35:58
As a Hodler who used one btc for a fireplace when it was 1.5k, I'm happy. I can't wait to see what type of fireplace I can buy when its back to 20k.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:57:18
You've also gained nothing but it's all good
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:20:34
Maybe! I've never modded but want to get involved in some type of BTC fun like this. Love the name and motive!
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:50:55
Amazing. Ive been in it for the long run and this actually scared me. Never again 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:22:19
Same here. I have love for all. I've seen my portfolio drop 20 percent today but I find peace in the chaos. No need to kick a (percieved) hurting horse. Only sociopaths enjoy that. I wish luck for Enlightened 2018
