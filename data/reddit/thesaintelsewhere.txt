So you're saying that if there were an Anarcho-Capitalist world how would people deal with violent thugs with guns? By defending themselves and their property or having the police do it.

That's a false comparison. Atheism as a movement has little to do with atheism as a state or a conclusion. That said, political agnosticism is probably a better descriptor.

It's ok. Don't be scared. I'll hold you. Your tribe of "3x as many" doesn't have to fight and kill anymore.

Bringing it out into the open for what it actually is.

So you probably have no idea how much you actually pay in taxes. If so how can you say this is a fair deal? What we are saying is that opening up these kinds of services to private enterprise means that these services would be cheaper for everyone, particularly laborers.


Bitcoin could easily change this. Say my employer pays me in Bitcoin, I pay for all of my food and lodging with Bitcoin, nowhere in those transactions does the government get the chance to touch my money.

What I mean to say is you can be a Socialist in an Anarcho-Capitalist world. It's really just a commitment to solving "political" problems thru trade and communication instead of violent domination.

So long as they aren't infringing on people's rights and come to agreements thru voluntary interaction I wouldn't have a problem with it. But then, it wouldn't be a State at all. I think the whole idea is to open up the realm that the State is supposed to cover (security, infrastructure, social dialogue) to experimentation. Ideally we would get all of the vigor and new types of thinking that a revolution brings, but without all the killing. Americans are particularly interested in this because there is a general feeling of fear and loss of control of our government. We are thrust into wars we don't want to fight, cities and municipalities are going bankrupt with police protection failing, and democracy itself has balkanized the nation.

Promote it however you like. It should be noted that the Anarcho-Capitalists have done quite a bit to spread the word on the idea. Although some of us have our doubts about it (Bitcoin that is).
@_date: 2013-07-26 20:16:59
What you're describing is pretty much exactly Anarcho-Capitalism. Those who want public schools in their part of the world are free to have them, so long as that doesn't involve taking money from people at gun point.
@_date: 2013-07-26 23:07:23
No, then it would be either charity or paying for a service. With the added benefit that you get to stop paying for the service or have someone fired when they do a shitty job.

This is true currently, but a fully functional crypto currency has no point of entry for government. Not saying that Bitcoin is uncrackable, but in theory an uncrackable currency cannot be manipulated and can't be accessed by a coercive agency.
@_date: 2013-07-27 00:41:34
If it was a simple exchange of money for a service they wouldn't need a gun.

Are there people within the territory when it is claimed? Does everyone agree beforehand? Do they allow people to leave? If everyone agrees, why would they need to use force? Couldn't they simply choose to exclude businesses that don't play by their rules by not trading with them? So far it sounds like you are describing a mafia. Long term, a territory without taxation will simply out compete the other by being more attractive to business. 
@_date: 2013-07-26 23:19:46
I'm probably using a broader definition of politics than you are. People are always going to need to communicate, seek alliances, work to shift opinion, try to find common ground and ways of interaction that the NAP doesn't touch on, etc. 
@_date: 2013-07-27 10:08:35
I think there has been mutual interest between the Bitcoin and Anarcho-Capitalist communities for awhile now. Mises.org has done important theoretical work on Bitcoin for example. Some of the people who helped build these online communities have been involved in both, the mods included.  They've put time and effort into these subs so they have a pretty good claim on making the final decision wouldn't you say? Also, where exactly is the harm in it?
@_date: 2013-07-22 07:26:47
Anarcho-Capitalism is not political. I'm not sure how cutting off a possible source of people who have a shared interest is going to help bitcoin permeate the masses either. But I'm done with this conversation. You've made your point- for whatever it's worth.
@_date: 2013-07-26 20:22:00
People have plenty of good reasons to put money into a pot, or even insist that businesses working in their area pay in the community. But I wouldn't really call this taxation. It only becomes taxation when people no longer have the choice to disengage with the machine.
@_date: 2013-07-26 21:58:16
The funny thing is that anyone who furthers Bitcoin is actively working to further Agorism and Anarcho-Capitalism whether that is their intention or not. I for one am fine with this (:
Anarcho-Capitalism is probably the most apolitical or antipolitical philosophy conceived of, so I'm not sure where this "politically biased" stuff comes from. 
@_date: 2013-07-27 10:35:29
The whole "it's all in how you look at things" attempt to force fit communism into voluntarism? There are very sound economic reasons why attempts at Communism have always ended up with people starving, forced labor, and pointing guns at one another. I would suggest reading Mises *Socialism* and *The Tragedy of the Commons* to get an understanding of these issues. These people had the greatest of intentions, it just does not work. Today, with the internet and the collective buying power of millions of socialists, these people have the power to buy up enough land and localize in one area, all without firing a shot or forcing anyone into anything. I think that's what they should be focusing their time on. Like the Venus Project. It's an interesting attempt and I'm pretty certain it will fail, but hey, more power to them.
Now imagine that there was an entity called "The State" that provided all of the services the state is supposed to provide- but people were allowed to opt out by using alternative currencies (which in many places are illegal), or simply by choosing not to pay for those services or by looking for another provider. At this point you've introduced competition and the power of markets.

So what happens if someone refuses to pay their taxes?
@_date: 2013-07-27 10:16:04
Occupy actually had a lot of Libertarian interest. Ending corporate personhood and limited liability are both shared goals. Personally I think their analysis of the problem is completely faulty and their tactics ridiculous, but whatever. The hard left does a very good job of demonizing libertarians or people who believe in private property in general though. (We're all evil racists who want poor people to die.) If you can make a decent case for a shared interest between Occupy and Bitcoin go ahead.

Funny how you guys are starting to arrive at some of the conclusions of Austrian theory.

We want to put an end to politics all together.

It should be linked. That sounds like a reasonable addition.
@_date: 2013-07-27 22:26:18
You're asking a lot of questions that we get all the time. Instead of just relying on me you should make a post on the anarcho capitalism board.
@_date: 2013-07-22 07:18:17
No. But I do think it's reasonable to link to a sub that posts articles about bitcoin on a daily basis.

The Ancap board is pretty much the default Austrian econ board. The Austrian board is pretty stagnant.
@_date: 2013-07-27 10:19:21
I've read your concerns. I just don't think you've made much of a point. It seems you're mostly worried that people will come to associate Bitcoin with Libertarianism politically, and this mostly upsets you because your political group has a knee jerk reaction against Libertarians. Sounds like some close minded people to me (;

The US is a vastly more Statist country than the Netherlands. There are serious problems with having a bureaucrat who is physically distant, has no incentive to help, cannot be fired, put in charge of arbitrating a dispute in which his employee is essentially the one on trial. Imagine if the US government were in charge of dealing with police problems in the Netherlands, how would you feel?

This is true in many ways, but as long as the State has control over currency, wage laws, public schooling, etcetera we live in their matrix.
As to your first point, so long as you want to live in a world with production goods, agriculture, medicine, and literature, private property is necessary in order properly allocate these resources. We may wax poetic about "Noble Savages" a la Engels and Rousseau, but there is plenty of evidence that in these societies people were violent and short-lived. They regularly practiced infanticide (which seems to go together with matrilineal culture) and tribal warfare. In an Anarcho-Capitalist world social experiments along these lines could be attempted, but I doubt they would last long. I do hope that people will choose a simpler, more frugal life in the absence of a government that has been doing everything in it's power to encourage consumption in the vain hope of stimulating "the economy."
