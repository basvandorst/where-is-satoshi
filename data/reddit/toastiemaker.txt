Thanks for typing that out. I read all of it and I agree with the points you make.
However, I do think that a small blocksize increase is inevitable. Opening and closing a LN channel will still take up space on the blockchain. Opening a LN channel for all current BTC addresses with a nonzero balance will take months. If we assume that the majority of transactions on the blockchain will be composed of opening and closing LN channels, then we still need larger blocks in the event of mass adoption (i.e., a hundred million users). The math is pretty simple; with 250k transactions per day we’re seeing now, it would take 400 days to open a LN channel for 100m people. And 100m people is merely 1.5% of the world population.
What’s your take on this?

I think that most of the traffic is probably to and from exchanges. I mean, what else is Bitcoin really used for? Definitely not paying for coffees. All we can realistically hope for in the short term is segwit adoption by exchanges, unfortunately.
I also think that there certainly are malicious actors bloating the mempool with spam transactions. It is not really all that expensive to spam transactions because the majority of them just end up bloating the mempool without ever being included in a block... frustrating!

Are payment channels in the LN always between 2 parties? Or can there be more than 2 parties?

Couldn’t agree more. I made the same point in a comment a few days ago.
I don’t understand why market forces are not driving segwit adoption RIGHT NOW. Right now, a segwit transaction is cheaper than a non-segwit transaction. Surely, rational behavior would be for everyone and their dog to get a segwit address to reduce fees. Why is that not happening?
Is it ignorance? Is it because the majority of transactions are to and from exchanges that have not adopted segwit addresses yet? Is it because people are so rich that they don’t care?

Thanks for sharing your views again. I fully agree that 1 megabyte blocks are a huge incentive for solutions such as the LN.
Raising the blocksize may be necessary to allow the LN itself to scale. Let me quote the Lightning Network paper by Joseph Poon:
"If all transactions using Bitcoin were conducted inside a network of micropayment channels, to enable 7 billion people to make two channels per year with unlimited transactions inside the channel, it would require 133 MB blocks (presuming 500 bytes per transaction and 52560 blocks per year). Current generation desktop computers will be able to run a full node with old blocks pruned out on 2TB of storage."
All I'm saying is this: if adaption of Bitcoin continues after rolling out the LN, then the blocksize must be incrementally increased to facilitate scaling of the LN.

Agreed. Both opening and closing a LN channel takes up space on the actual blockchain. Merely opening new LN channels will easily fill up 1 mb blocks if adoption continues. A blocksize increase is necessary, even with LN.

Hmm, I stand corrected!
Got my numbers from here:  I guess they're wrong!
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:39:41
There’s absolutely no way .5% of the world population is involved in BTC.
There are a little less than 750,000 unique BTC addresses used on the blockchain according to blockchain.info. The world population is a little less than 7.5 billion people. So it’s more like .0001% or 1 in 10000, assuming that each unique address belongs to an individual, which is probably not a valid assumption.
EDIT: Looks like I'm wrong. Got the 750,000 number from  but doesn't seem to be right.

Thanks for typing that out! Very insightful. Your comment should be way higher up.

Get a Coinbase account and buy on GDAX. Why GDAX? Because they will pay the miner fee if you choose to transfer the BTC to your own wallet.
When buying such a small USD amount, the miner fee would otherwise eat up a significant part of it.

I watched it live too!
The family father mentioned that they went all-in when BTC was valued €2700 this summer. So they've already doubled their initial investment by now.
They do a "little bit" of day trading to generate income for daily expenses.

Hey X! Thanks for sharing your article. I'm new to Bitcoin and the scaling issue makes a lot more sense now. Subscribed :)

In his defense, he's addressing those people who've secured a lot of BTC wealth already. He's saying that those people can easily invest $20,000 to help secure the network that they depend on.
Correct me if I'm wrong!

Aside of mining, can a Raspberry Pi (provided with enough storage capacity and a solid internet connection) be used as a full bitcoin node?
How much storage would be required to do this? It would need to hold a complete copy of the blockchain, I imagine. How many GB's is that?
@_date: 2017-06-29 21:53:48
Link to your article? :) I'm curious now!
@_date: 2017-06-24 23:00:49
Thank you so much for elaborating! I read some reviews of the first edition and they are overwhelmingly positive. I just placed a preorder on Amazon :)
@_date: 2017-06-24 21:41:16
This is considered among the best books on bitcoin?

Thanks :)
