Spent around 15 minutes trying to construct a joke about your wife's 4K appreciation and my HD ballsack but I failed. 
Just thought I'd put that out there. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 22:57:21
I think she's hot.
@_date: 2014-02-02 00:51:10
Thanks for the heads up. Didn't watch the news today but I'm glad I saw this.
@_date: 2014-05-25 20:33:05
Thanks man.
EDIT: It says the macro is corrupted or something.
Btw congrats on the green.

I see you are using Wordpress, just like

Not even a little regret?

Me. Sup?
@_date: 2014-04-10 21:42:33
No, what is this nonsense?
@_date: 2014-03-06 10:55:51
Why did my warning get down-voted?
@_date: 2014-05-11 00:07:14
This is my new alarm clock song.
@_date: 2014-04-10 21:40:11
Good luck mate. Just keep your coins safe in an offline wallet and see where you're at a year from now. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 18:09:12
Same here.

To have proof you need evidence. If you have enough evidence then you have proof.
For example if the Police were looking for a murderer and they found a man with blood on his hands. That would be one piece of evidence. If they found a knife in his pocket, that would be more evidence.
When they have enough evidence they have proof.'

Video if anyone wants to watch it again :P
@_date: 2014-04-10 18:10:03
You have no idea what you're talking about. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 21:49:45
Holy shit this is genius. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 18:29:50
In my opinion the odds are completely in favor of btc. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 22:26:03
@_date: 2014-04-10 22:51:28
Try seeing Bitcoin as a P2P framework which has unlimited potential for innovations in a lot of markets, rather than a currency. 
Like a torrent protocol for the economy.

Let's see what the 500k has become in a year or two. 
@_date: 2014-01-22 04:58:47
Damn :/ Kind of jealous actually..
@_date: 2014-04-10 23:03:09
What were they like?
@_date: 2014-04-10 23:01:48
"Buy" would have sufficed. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 18:03:14
Not a very good domain. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 10:54:04
Nice to see someone else with this question.
I guess the best you can do is just read and lurk the news yourself to get a feeling of the overall sentiment.
@_date: 2014-04-30 23:53:00
I can't wait to see their reactions in 10 years when btc thrives. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 22:21:03
No.

I just set up an email message with a link to this post that will be sent to myself in a year. It's gonna be great.

All you need to know? Stupid title..

Where would you advice me to list my shop  to get some sales?
@_date: 2014-04-16 18:33:05
@_date: 2014-05-27 22:17:23
Of course the N64 beats them. I was talking about spending the BTC that is worth much more now. 
But if he bought more coins when he spent them it would be fine I guess. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 01:26:11
You have my support.
@_date: 2013-12-20 01:24:25
I update product prices around once every 1 or 2 days. 
Also I'm holding onto LTC long-term.

I don't really think my bank would just do that?
I didn't call that Mayzus FC yet. I will call them tomorrow first. If that doesn't work I will try to fix it with my bank.
I did mail my bank. They said something useless about going to the police etc.

I did a €1500 SEPA transfer on the 20th of November. Still haven't heard a thing. Now I found out there is a minimum deposit of €2000. Probably won't see that money ever again.
They are ignoring my tickets.
@_date: 2013-12-20 01:45:58
Thank you, I'll take a look at that. I think it may help build a bit of a community around the store. Is tipping other chat users what you mean with it involving BTC?
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:48:49
I think most countries are still trying to decide / figure out what to do with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-14 13:48:35
It's up again :)
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:59:09
I want to call them now but really I have nothing to say that they can use to help me.. how did it go for you?
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:49:55
Nice idea, thanks.
@_date: 2013-04-28 21:00:52
If anyone is interested I love

Thank you very much. Enjoy.

I think he was being sarcastic.
@_date: 2013-12-20 01:46:46
Yeah, mining isn't going to work on a laptop ;)
You could consider exchanging some BTC or other crpyto for spending or investing. I highly recommend taking a look at  I have some good experiences with it.

That was because of the Russian host which they've moved from. Now based in USA with Namecheap.
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:51:44
Haven't had to yet.
@_date: 2013-04-28 21:43:57
So far there's just this:
@_date: 2013-04-29 16:21:50
It's not a scam you fucking idiot.

Same here??
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:26:19
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:20:29
Thank you for your reply. This makes sense. I hope this is the case. I guess all I can do is wait.
@_date: 2013-04-28 21:28:17
It's great :) The more stores like this the better.
Also I bought a GTA IV key and received it instantly.
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:11:51
Short answer: definitely not.
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:53:03
I have price alerts set up on my phone. It has happened to me before that BTC rates dropped faster than I could update them, and people made orders. They got lucky :)
