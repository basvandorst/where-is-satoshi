Okay this is confusing me now. So on tails i opened my electrum wallet and went to wallet and clicked on master public key but that doesnt give me a qr code

Also on android Electrum asks for private key not public. Fuck is there a easier way to do this

ohh okay gotcha. That helps a lot. I'm just trying to do this secure and as anonymous as possible so will me sending it to my phone first and then the electrum wallet be bad?

okay so I got the app ceated the watch only wallet wich had me scan a qr code of one of those generated addresses. Did I do it right? So all I would have to do is go to the atm buy whatever I'm gunna buy then go on my phone to the app and click receive and then scan that qr code with the atm?

Yep they do sweet. So what your saying too is that the recieve address will change and android on my phone will generate a new one? And they to send it from android to tails electrum i just go to send and then scan a different qr code?

I kinda wanted to do the lease amount of transactions because doesn't it cost every transaction? 
And so are you saying those pre generated addresses are ones I can use to send bitcoins to?
