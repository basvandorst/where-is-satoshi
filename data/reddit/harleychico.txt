NY did not indict him for 5 of the 6 alleged hits. Why not, if it's real and they have actual proof? We'll see if the sixth holds up. Sad how easily the public is manipulated.

She goes into the constitutional implications of the case plus prosecutorial misconduct, the murder-for-hire, etc. so you missed the best part. And the auctioned btc was from seizing the Silk Road server. It wasn't his.

No evidence to prove, but as demonstrated here, useful to smear someone. People believe what the government and media tell them.
@_date: 2014-07-06 03:02:02
You're awfully quick to try and convict with no evidence.

Key words: "assuming that the reported facts in this case are correct"; "If this is true." And of course if Ross was actually DPR at the time. Lots of assumptions flying around. 
@_date: 2014-04-22 22:52:38
I thought the nature of DPR was to pass the identity along, that there were likely more than one DPRs. I don't get how the feds, or anybody, can just assume that Ross was the only DPR and that he was DPR in 2013 when all the potential violence supposedly occurred. Interesting read about the different DPR personalities here:

Murder for hire charges have not been proven! When arraigned he was not indicted for five out of six of them. There has been no arraignment for the remaining one in MD. They used it to deprive him of bail and have not submitted any evidence that he did this. Just because they say it, doesn't make it true.

How about Forbes: 
"Notably missing from the charges, in fact, are any that mention prosecutors’ claims that he engaged in murder-for-hire schemes intended to have six people killed, including a potential witness and a blackmailer. While Ulbricht has been charged with murder-for-hire in one of those cases in a Maryland court–the DEA-faked killing of Dread Pirate Roberts employee Curtis Clark Green–the other five cases haven’t been included in his criminal indictment, possibly due to the fact that no bodies were ever found for those alleged victims."

Parroting the prosecution.

Murder for hire was not contracted on SR

Wow, quite a proclamation considering discovery has barely begun and the actual evidence is barely in. Maybe you know something nobody else does? Or maybe you're just fast to convict, with nothing but the government's story and media "reporting" to go by. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 00:35:46
Guilty until proven innocent? Is that how it is in this country now? It has not been proven that he tried to have people killed. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 22:19:02
An indictment isn't evidence. Just because the government says it doesn't make it so. They actually have to prove it.
@_date: 2014-04-21 23:17:05
Math error: 5 alleged "assassin hits" dropped in NY. 1 remains in MD.

To say they didn't drop the murder for hire charges in NY is untrue. 5 charges were in the complaint, they used it to deny bail and then they did not indict him for a single one at his arraignment. Why not, if they had evidence? There is one remaining in MD that hasn't been addressed and hasn't been proven, just as the others weren't.
@_date: 2014-04-22 00:02:08
And you know, without actual evidence, that he committed these acts and is not innocent? Do you have a special source of info you'd like to share, even though the evidence from the prosecution isn't even submitted yet? I assume so, since you're declaring that he should rot for life. Or maybe you're the one who's retarded? 
@_date: 2014-04-21 22:16:14
Oh, so you know what he's guilty of?? Nothing has been proven! In case you didn't know, Rolling Stone isn't evidence and neither are allegations from the FBI. They actually still have to prove things. And interesting how NY didn't indict him for the murder charges.
@_date: 2014-04-21 22:49:57
NY did not indict him for any of the five of their murder-for-hire charges. We'll see what happens to the remaining one in MD and if they have any proof. But hey, it is a great way to destroy someone, as evidenced here.
@_date: 2014-07-14 00:54:16
Very clever. You might try watching the part about the constitution. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 22:45:52
You cite "official court documents" as if they are fact. They are not proven facts. They are only the prosecution's unproven allegations. Frightening how many people believe what the government feeds them. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 23:49:05
They used murder for hire in NY to deny him bail. And why didn't they indict him for it (allegedly 5 victims) if they had proof? One alleged "hit" left in MD. We'll see.
@_date: 2014-04-14 17:29:46
Why would you assume that he committed a heinous crime? Because the prosecution says so? Nothing has been proven, but alleging violence certainly makes for an effective smear job.
@_date: 2014-07-06 02:56:44
Depressing how many believe what the government says without question. Wow.
@_date: 2014-07-14 01:43:22


Have you seen evidence the defense hasn't? Do you know this was "definitely" Ross? You seem so sure "this is the fact." Yet nothing has been proven.
@_date: 2014-07-06 03:09:44
Five were in NY. They are now "uncharged crimes" that don't require proof and are not an indictment. One remains in MD. Not plural. Not proven.
@_date: 2014-04-21 00:21:28
Nothing has been proven. Do you always automatically believe what the media and feds say? Let's see their evidence.
@_date: 2014-05-01 13:40:12
Keep believing what the Feds tell you and live in a world of lies.
@_date: 2014-08-28 15:19:08
Yes they are, he is pleading not guilty. At this stage it is the prosecution's indictment that is challenged by the defense. The point is how the government is conducting the prosecution, and also how they investigated it (addressed in new round of pre-trial motions).  Guilt/innocence is addressed at trial.
@_date: 2014-04-21 23:28:52
NY did not indict him for 5 murder-for-hire allegations. 5 down, one left in MD.
