 I've been waiting for these to go commercial...

Works great, little volume... but the more people that know about it, the more volume it has!

Shilling his own store/product on Amazon.  There is NOTHING redeemable about this other than they have very detailed sizing chart.  I found it more interesting to be honest.

what? Bisq is a decentralized exchange that does not require KYC and has support for fiat deposits + withdrawals.  Shapeshift is a decentralized exchanged that until recently did not require KYC and has zero support for fiat deposits + withdrawals.


So yeah, Bisq is a fiat gateway without KYC.

BitFury has been in the ASIC game since nearly the very beginning.  The problem, so to speak is that they went private and no longer offer products to the public and just build to mine for themselves and business partners.

TLDR; Own Bitcoin = No.

yeah it can do that too.  The quick version is, you deposit cash to somebodys bank account. they verify they got it, then they release crypto to you.  If anything fishy happens, you involve an arbiter and they decide how to proceed.  IE, they will decide that you do or do not get the coins.  If you dont, they will request the seller to refund the cash or else they will forfeit the coins and the coins will be sent to the buyer.

Yep. This must be it.  Poor communication of the issue and quick to blame the Devs

My guess it could be if:
1) It matched the correct length
2) Followed any private key requirements

Bcash is not only featured differently, its also green from so much envy.

Probably 4-5 are dead, the rest are still alive or merged.

We're you the one always fighting against this?

The most obvious example, is actually a local one for you.  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.  
From everything i've seen, she has a great team and if she controls her own twitter, then she makes excellent judgement calls / statements as well. 
While I know nothing about being a Public Advocate, whenever you run for office you are essentially marketing yourself.  AOC went from 'nobody' to somebody in one year and that is your goal as well.  You already know the issues, so at this point its all about how you can get your message across.  This means everything from your speech patterns (removing long drawn outs uuhhhs, repeating yourself while you collect your thoughts, etc) to being more focused on the camera as if you are directly speaking to the world.  Everything I mention is shown your video "answer to doug crypto".  That youtube video has been out for almost a year and has less than 140 views.  This is because, the title does not properly explain the purpose of it, the details section is sparse and you did a poor job with the backstory of it at the beginning.  Although the actual content and flow was great.  You could also get creative and update your youtube vids with your name and add the following tags:  'Public' 'Advocate', 'Public Advocate', 'NYC', 'NY', Bitlicense', 'Bitcoin License', '2019', things like that to give you more exposure for zero marketing dollars.  You could also shoot another video from home, going over why people should want you for P.A. and/or why they should want you on the virtual currency task force.  Come up with a nickname for yourself, like the Bitlicense Abolishist or something like that, the way Roger Ver used to be Bitcoin Jesus.  The marketing of yourself for PA, is the exact same as marketing yourself against the Bitlicense.  
From my perspective, I am interested in your fight as typically California/New York laws influence the other states.  Regulation is needed, but its obviously too heavy handed as seen from almost all crypto companies escaping NYC to go elsewhere.  Last I checked, it was only 3-4 companies I thought that had a license.

You need better online 'marketing'.  Your goal and fight so far has been really interesting to watch from afar, but most people on here dont care because they do not see/understand how this bitlicense can and does influence the rest of the states and potentially on a federal level as well as a copy/paste framework that stifles innovation.
