They serve a few Middle East countries but not sure if Jordan is one of them. I’ve been using them for a while now

Time to buy and then invest the BTC in alt coins which would be in red coz of the drop in BTC ��

Use either a paper wallet or a hard wallet like trezor, keepkey or ledger. I invested in a trezor before I even had 1 BTC to my name. Now I use it for my BTC, BCH and ETH

I’m in UAE so we have a local exchange. I transfer cash to it and buy. I always keep spare fiat at hand.
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:44:30
Yeah I already bought some and waiting for another dip to buy some more
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:39:11
Buy on the dip and better your average. If it falls more buy more and better your average again.
