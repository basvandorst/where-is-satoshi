    Hey there. We recently released a blog post related to this issue - http:=
    //blog.blockchain.com/2014/12/08/blockchain-info-security-disclosure/
    
    When making a scheduled software update overnight to our web-wallet, our =
    development team inadvertently affected a part of our software that ensur=
    es private keys are generated in a strong and secure manner.
    
    The issue was present for a brief period of time between the hours of 12:=
    00am and 2:30am GMT on December the 8th 2014. The issue was detected quic=
    kly and immediately resolved. In total, this issue affected less than 0.0=
    002% of our user base and was limited to a few hundred addresses.
    
    We have sent an alert to all users who have potentially vulnerable addres=
    ses in their wallets, for which we have an email on file. We are committe=
    d to working with any affected users to assess and rectify any issues.
    
    If you created a wallet, generated a new address via Blockchain.info=E2=80=
    =99s web-wallet, or sent bitcoin from your wallet during this time period=
     and have not provided us with your email address, please contact our sup=
    port desk at support or simply create a new wallet=
    .
    
    Addresses, wallets and transactions created via the Blockchain.info iOS a=
    nd Android apps, and the Chrome extension are not affected.
    
    If an address(es) you control was impacted by this, and it contained fund=
    s, please reply with the following:
    
    -Your wallet identifier
    -The password to the wallet - this will allow us to verify with 100% cert=
    ainty that you are the one who generated the keys for this address.
    -The address or addresses in your wallet that were affected by this
    
    If you did not have funds sent to this address(es) then you can go ahead =
    and generate a new wallet at  &amp; ign=
    ore this other wallet.
    
    Thank you, and sorry for any inconvenience.

As of a couple hours ago yes I have gotten my coins back.
@_date: 2014-12-15 12:13:15
I had already cleared out all my address in that account, and the address in question had been drained.  So I sent them the details thinking the worst that could happen is I lose an empty BC.I account.  They have replied to me asking for a safe address to send my coins.  It went better then expected, but asking for a users login info EVER weather it is encrypted or not is a horrible security practice.
