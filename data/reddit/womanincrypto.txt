I agree I'm just thinking about how we can increase the number of the people who "control" it

I'm just trying to understand, Reddit is also for this ,right?

What do you think about BTCPay develop by Nicolas Dorier? 
@_date: 2018-08-19 20:17:49
Maybe :) If we increase the number of merchants accepting crypto so they can process their own payments through a bitcoin full node via a BTCPay Server, in that way the number of the nodes rise, and the 10 miners' control will decrease

It doesn't matter if they have a population of 30k people. What matters most is the regulatory environment. Since San Marino is a member of the European Union, a carefully crafted regulation could open the doors to many institutional investors willed to join this space.
At the moment we need more regulatory certainty, so this move is a piece of good news from this point of view

That's not a clickbait headline. Is what Tim Draper stated. And what's the problem if my account is only 6 days old? I like to be active and post topics related to this bitcoin subreddit.

I know people with more than 90% of their wealth in crypto. I don't know if that's a wise or a risky situation :D
@_date: 2018-07-20 13:07:37
for me that's censorship.
I was reading r/BITCOIN RULES  and guidelines. There's no rule to avoid posting articles to specific domain. I'm not doing anything wrong. Just posting and following reddit rules.

That's not a sockpuppet account. Is not my business if Reddit does not provide a way to verify an account by providing info or docs about my identity.
