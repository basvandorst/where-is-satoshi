I was just thinking today we need an X-Prize type fund for chemistry to develop plastics that don't last a thousand years, no one needs thousand year packaging.  Nip the problem in the bud.

That's a really good point, however alcohol and drugs were never an existential threat to the global financial system status quo.
But I hear you.

I am just being the devil's advocate, not trying to sell anything.
But it makes me think that there is a sweet spot for crypto in the global economy: big enough to matter but small enough not to be a real bother to the banking establishment.
I am no expert, but I feel like if any cryptocurrency becomes a real threat to the establishment, they will regulate it to death. You'd be hearing about anti-money laundering, funding terrorism, or whatever crap they can think of.  These guys run the world, and they crash the global economy just for kicks sometimes. Also, you are not just messing with bankers, but the petrodollar. Oil guys are not above an African civil war or two to maximize returns. They are not going to give up all of that consolidated power without an epic fight. As far as asserting their dominance, we ain't seen nothin' yet.
Edit: clarity and more possible doom and gloom

If the bankers all gang up on crypto, they could force global change, even in Russia and Brazil.  You just freeze the offending institution or country's foreign fiat assets, and kick them off of SWIFT.
They would drop crypto like a rock, as it's the way smaller market.

I have a question about block size and adoption as currency. I own no crypto yet, and I have no religious agenda.
If LN has issues, misses some timeline or just does not work at scale, are you all in favor of increasing block size in that possible outcome?
