You can tell when someone is hopped up with gambling fever. The signs are tell tale. Effusively positive, total denial that anything could go wrong - and the most dangerous form of denial is to admit something could go wrong i.e. "I know this could collapse at any moment, but I'm going to buy a few more." Every day, you miss 1000s of opportunities to double your money trading options. But you also miss 10x as many opportunities to lose all of it.

I'm sure you'd still be spending a lot of time on that if you had a loved one with Cancer needing the most advanced treatment, unable to pay because the market has decided that should cost 10,000 bitcoins.

Yea, something like that. That does not mean EVERYONE gets that. People can still be rich, but in a society with so much wealth, I don't think people should be homeless.

In the sense that society gives us all security, then yes, society, which has evolved to government is the parent, in as much as it protects us. Of course, it can put us in jail as well, I'm not blind to that. But I think most people agree there should be certain punishments for certain crimes.... Of course there are an infinite number of issues with incarceration and the US government (as I am American) needs a TON of fixing...

---- The "what about the roads" argument is a fallacious one in that it attempts to justify the morality of an inherently immoral act by pointing to the perceived net-positive of the result. This is about as valid as a pre-Civil War southerner exclaiming "but who will pick the cotton which is the foundation of our way of life??!!" ----
It's still an absurd comparison, one I dare you to make in public. 
equating taxation (that pays for social security, for medicare, medicaid, food stamps, but also things I don't agree with as well!) with slavery is some bush league ayn rand stuff. Society has evolved, this isn't a binary, like everything else in life.
I'm sure your life, as someone who has to pay taxes, is no different than a slave family's. - that's why it's offensive.
Tell a senior citizen you want to take away their social security, see what happens.
Tell a struggling family you wan to take away their food stamps, see what they say.
Tell someone with a heart condition you want to take away their government healthcare.
Say that to these people's face instead of just being a smartass on the internet.
That's all I can really say.

Yea, options can go days without being traded. So bid-ask gives market players a sense of its value.
It's interesting, though - I've heard anecdotally of situations in which a sovereign (government) gets downgraded and the bid falls, as do the asks, but no trade takes place. So thinly traded existing bonds (which are priced on the last trade) may not reflect bid-ask changes at all and just sit at the same price as before the downgrade. Of course, when they want to issue new debt, it matters....

Unless you no longer hold the currency, you will inevitably check up on it. I have no idea where bitcoin will go (no one does), but the only way to not think about it is to sell it and be at peace with whatever money you may forgo.

This is so shortsighted.

That's not a fair comparison to make. Even if low Chinese wages were only the government's fault, which they are not, 1 bad government doesnt mean all governments are that way...

Before affordable care act, if you had a pre-existing condition, insurance companies could just say we wont cover you. I have a pre-existing condition, so I for one am glad for government in this instance. 
Businesses are constantly trying to pay workers less. Without minimum wage, wages would be lower.
I may have been hyperbolic but there are certain truths.
A pattern seems to be emerging here (not you ArrowzworrA) - how many of you would be comfortable saying these things to a struggling family that is being helped out by government assistance? I think there's a reason this type of anti-government thought proliferates in places you don't have to face the real problems (i.e. on the internet) that so many people face, problems that for better or worse, the government is really the only one in a position to alleviate.

I'm sure I've just committed sacrilege on reddit for not knowing that. :)

Slavery to the market perhaps.
Supply and demand are part of the world no doubt, but we have evolved from being simple animals for a reason. We can design societies to help one another, which doesn't mean communism, doesn't mean slavery or whatever.
"Society hasn't evolved. Slavery has. Free-range cattle produce much more efficiently than when chained." - These allegories are just silly. Say what you mean, not what you're saving for your next fan fiction ayn rand imitation, which in general the only place this thought is at home.
@_date: 2013-11-28 07:04:20
Well, looks like no one is cabable of an answer without resorting to bizarre analogies or nonsensical assumptions about "free markets", which seems to be the rcreed of so many here. Its as much a religion as Christianity or Islam...
So much extremism and folks saying things on the internet they'd be afraid to say in person to another member of their community, a person with real human needs. So they hide on the internet. Last time I try to engage this bunch.
This binary view of the world - all gov is bad, is very, very childish. I'm sure we can agree on many things individually, but I can't really take seriously someone that compares slavery to being taxed. How narcissistic and angry does one have to be to say that? 
@_date: 2013-11-28 04:35:15
What about net neutrality. Internet companies seem to want to charge more for certain content. Who is stopping them? The government.
You can see how companies naturally actually want to curtail the very things that make it possible for the internet to foster bitcoin. 
Monopoly is the natural progression of unfettered capitalism, not the other way around. Look at the oil industry in the 1800s.
I also really take offense to your comparison on building roads to slavery. Roads help you get to the hospital. Slavery subjugated an entire race. Both were endorsed by the government, but at very different times, and if you can't see that there is a natural progression in thought and that not ALL government throughout history is the same, - as if it were a simple binary and not shades in between -then that is problematic in my opinion.
EDIT: Having seen that bit from the youtube video, the point to take away is traffic regulation can be improved, not done away with! Here is lack of government: 
Also, that WSJ article is regarded by over 30 pages of comments as BS revisionist history, taking the quotes it uses totally out of context.

But what about those who can't pay for it? Doesn't that go against the entire liberating, egalitarian nature of the internet, why we love it so much? The logic doesn't hold, right?

I may have strong feelings about this, but I'm genuinely curious about how bitcoin can exist without the government while ensuring everyone has access to the internet. That's what I want to know.

So, what should be done to make sure your friend has healthcare?
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:28:31
When did I say that? That's not what I believe. I do think that people should be provided with enough so that they do not suffer, even if that makes others in society angry or uncomfortable, as it seems to on this board.

I'm sure there would be technical issues, since from what I understand these exchanges don't always work perfectly (not that wall street does either...). 
But you could ask the same question of any exchange. If EVERYONE tried to sell a stock at the same time, there would be no buyers and the price would fall to halfway between the bid and ask (I think) - so a bitcoin would be worth half of whatever the smallest bitcoin unit is, assuming people are willing to unload them at ANY price.
Of course, you can short stocks, so people would probably be covering too, which would stem the fall.
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:37:21
Bid - Ask is how options are priced, actually. I think stocks are still last sale.
Also, the "price" is only meaningful if an exchange takes place. So if everyone is selling, then the best price you can come up with is the lowest sale price. In this case, something miniscule.
But hasn't it been the case that the exchanges really slow down when there is a lot of selling? I remember that after the first jump to 250 or whatever it was..
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:13:44
Someone would buy... and the price would drop. Always happens.
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:51:23
But the original question was about bitcoin existing for all without the government, as the government ensures the internet is available for EVERYONE, which as I understand, (correct me if I'm wrong) is a central tenet of bitcoin.

What about roads to poor neighborhoods where the price outweighs any profit to be made from linking those people with the rest of the market? That's one of many questions...

There's a lot that can be fixed, but that doesn't mean the government should disappear from the healthcare sector.
Without government, you can't sue a doctor for negligence, you can't make sure your hospital is clean etc. You would have to rely on the market to tell you what is worth more, in theory better, but then you might not be able to afford that care. I mean, comon...
