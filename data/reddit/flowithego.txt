I'm looking into jumping on board, I'm just convinced it's no longer an *investment*, what's out there that states otherwise? I don't want to keep the price down for you guys any longer.

We're talking about Cryptography here, I think it's safe to presume that a high level of discipline in *thinking/foresight/planning* goes without saying. The creation of a Cryptocurrency? That *definitely* is going to need a healthy overdose of the above. 
Isn't everything that is an *innovation* inherently an experiment? Just like an internet start-up is also an experiment. I fail to see how those cypherpunk/cryptoanarchists etc. doesn't fit the label of *thinkers* tbh, and to say the likes of which can not be referred to as a *sophisticated cabal*, again, is just missing the point. If anything, they fit the description *flawlessly*. You should read into some of the other developers and very early adopters of bitcoin, they seem to be an organised bunch, and it's about time they organised anyway.  
My main issue with your original post was that, someone or a group of people responsible for the creation of such a sophisticated technology would be as blasé in reaction to the only existent product of the system he/she/they were involved in the development of. Could there be unpredictable scenario(s) during development which could produce such results, sure! But for it to be a *successful experiment* he/she/they'd need to be a little more aware and a little less "thought nothing of it".

Really? I mean, reaaaaally? You think that a comp. scientist(s) with a level of comprehension that is to be expected of a creator of such technology is; 'oops I misplaced my bit coins I have no idea where they are now'? 
Hell naw. 
The simplest explanation theory for me results in Satoshi being a conglomerate of thinkers who had plenty of time hypothesising, discussing and simulating. They would've either been able to predict, or would've seen scenarios arise and reacted accordingly. That seems to be the most organic line of events to me.

I do agree with what you're saying to some extent, but I think his simple and selfless way of speaking coupled with the truth is quite unique I think. In regards to the anarchist tone, I think it's a lot more managed and considerate of etiquette than I've seen in the past. It's a lot less rant-full and actually offers practical alternatives, I think it's a fresh bit of air to the anarchist discourse. 
However, it would be advisable for him to watch a few public speeches for insight and maybe work on presentation. These however can also come with organic experience which he seems to be absorbing a lot of.

He doesn't have to. It's obviously out there in the open.

I understand that it's all to do with continued confidence and adoption, perceived value etc. What I'm asking for really is signifiers that point to it's sustained adoption, i.e Russia and China pushing it as an alternative reserve currency to the US Dollar (which is a pretty damn big signifier in itself), but I was just wondering what other indicators are out there.

If he indeed is as paranoid/secretive as he's made out to be, he could've taken those steps to attempt to "scramble" his tracks fairly easily, no?

What you say in your comments about SR's inevitable demise was very plausible. 
Us humans are just too happy in our confirmation bias bubbles.
