As I mentioned below physalisx's comment: German institution which works against money laundering has been all over Localbitcoins.com and got at least some sellers (and maybe users too) into trouble.    
Only thing missing for Bitcoiners who want meetups is a way to make institutions like these stay the heck out of there or identify them so every user can decline having contact with them.    
  
Hope some day some genius lawyers go to highest possible court level and sort this shit out. Or Bitcoin only get's to stay alive in Germany with bank transfers to exchanges. (Which IS going to cause problems for buyers and sellers very soon too, wait for it.)  
  
Scenario 1: Off-the-grid Bitcoin deals are going to be highly illegal, German anti-money-laundering task forces are being created and chasing users like the German DEA does with drug users and sellers.  
Scenario 2: Bitcoiners win, financial banking sectors as we know it today will be dead in 20 years and the world is good again.  
  
Fuck all this.. :\
  
P.S.: Since Germany has a highly detailed database about citizens and doesn't give a fuck about privacy anymore and people who don't respect the law are being set on a special kind of watchlist basicly as enemies and threats. Count Bitcoiners who did/want off-the-grid Bitcoin-for-cash deals in soon.

They are also spamming blogs pretty aggressive even if the comment is deleted. Targeted in various languages.

If we don't spread the word (outside of reddit) to make people stop using it I only see this stuff getting more worse. This is far from good. I remember a Bitcoin developer saying there is no solution. (Forgot who it was.)

Forgot the name of them but they were actually hunting down sellers in Germany to make them get cash transmitter licenses or face huge fines. Or both. Forgot the details, read some reports about it some time ago. (I think it was an institution like Fincen for Germany. But I'm an idiot here because I totally forgot the name, as already said above.)  
And I also think they created seller accounts to somehow fuck the buyers that didn't want to have the transactions being listed on their bank statements.  
That's where the pressure comes from.  
  
And as far as I remember from the conversation on the phone I had with the institution who pressures buyers and sellers, they wanted to tell me I need a money transmitter license even as a regular buyer who buys for holding via exchanges. Which doesn't make any sense at all. They just want to fuck you over with casual words and a happy grin in their face.   
Unspoken reality is: Bitcoin is not really welcome in Germany. It threatens the whole banksector and of course some lobbyists. (Like everywhere else) Sure every register is being pulled to regulate Bitcoin to near-death.    
(Don't believe it? Try making a call yourself with them and talk about it. You'll hear from the first minute that you are not welcome. Not a bit at all. And you'll get fucked over from the second you'll mention Bitcoin, no matter what questions you have and how friendly you are asking.)

Remember: Bitcoin has it's enemies, and these guys are trying everything to get Bitcoin a bit closer to death. (Which is far away right now.) But expect a fuckload more of negative responses on social media. (I'm talking not only r/Bitcoin, more Twitter and Facebook)
 
I recommend always giving tips to those who run a company and aren't sure if Bitcoin is good for them or not. Let them find out. Maybe link them 2-3 websites that get them started quickly with accepting Bitcoin. And don't start childish discussions with nay-sayers that don't argue or haven't understand Bitcoin and just want to troll or make it look bad. Those who really don't understand Bitcoin may be helped with a short explanation, a video or a website link, which clears things up for them. Most of them like the idea behind Bitcoin anyway from the day they notice how it really works.
 
Since my first day I'm into Bitcoin I'm positive about the gaming industry using Bitcoin in the future. No doubt.

Yeah, all qt clients stopped working with random i/o errors on various machines on win mac and linux. Tried reinstalling them several times + deleting blockchain and wallet data. Nothing. Still the same. Tried it more than 10 times, even via an fresh installed OS.
I really really wanted to spend some but I can't since the latest Bitcoin Core update. I don't want to use web wallets ever, not even for 1 second. It all seems messed up. For now.

I really hate hijacking threads. But I got to ask:  
Since these marketplaces seem to have a high amount of worldwide users, I'm wondering if it could get me into **any** trouble selling totally legal things on a marketplace like SR.  
(Digital and printed art for example would be what I'm interested in)
  
OpenBazaar may be nice too, but I think the activity on these "classic" markets like SR (evolution etc) have a higher amount of users.   
  
What would I have to look out for when doing so to not get into trouble?  
I remember reading about vendors who just sold completely legal things like art on SR, but I don't remember if these guys got into trouble.  
  
Or is it illegal in the first place just "hanging out" as a legal vendor selling art products on a marketplace like this, even without even touching those illegal products from other vendors in the first place? Would I have to hide my identity too? (If so, I think I'd be not interested.)
  
Happy for all answers!  
  
Ontopic: Of course I'm all behind Ross, hope the best for him and his family. Only time can show us what's going to happen. He did some major work for evolving the world of digital marketplace and also for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-12 21:32:24
Yep, didn't think of that in the first place. Just thought about using their well known traffic which seems to be high for generating legal sales.  
I think I'll just check out OpenBazaar soon! Don't expect to be many potential clients there, but hey it could generate at least something. :)

@_date: 2015-01-12 14:08:48
Wow!  
I just thought a bit deeper about selling my art there.  
I think buyers could get into trouble since a legal vendor would have to archive the buyer history (depending on the country) for taxing and what not. (In my country everything has to be archived, from invoices to whathefuck you could possibly imagine)  
Let's take this a step ahead: Some buyers from around the world buy my art products on these marketplaces. Those buyers also happened to maybe buy other stuff from vendors which is not legal. Feds would simply have to seize the archive of  my business to simply get all the adresses + my marketplace login data. ---&gt; A lot of buyers could get into trouble just because of a legal purchase which could disclose their illegal purchases.  
  
Maybe it's not the best idea.
  
Or am I thinking maybe too tinfoilish there?
  
Thanks for the quick answer by the way, greatly appreciate it!

I think more banks in Germany are going to be scared too in the future. (Even though this thread isn't about a German bank.) This is a good sign guys. Bitcoin is on it's way to get the regular banks out of business. They are scared and they should be.
I really think that in a few years we will reach a day where no bank, except for 1-2, will do transactions to coinbase and other exchange services. I am really waiting for that day to go to my bank, finally get everything out in cash, convert it person-to-person to Bitcoin and never touch EUR/USD again. This day is going to come, sooner or later.

So, I have contacted several tax lawyers and no one of them could give a proper advice on taxing bitcoin trades in Germany.
Not even the tax authorities were able to answer that question, they didn't even know what this kind of digital wabbleblabble is. (And I have contacted several different tax authorities spread over Germany)
 
This weekend I am writing a letter to request a real proper answer from the highest authority I can reach. (There has been a posted letter on from a German user, who got an answer - but sadly I can't find that thread and can't remember if it goes into detailed trading and affects massive trades or is just for people that trade like 1-3 btc per month.)
 
What might be interesting in this case is: Trading into another alternative currency. BTC-E's "US Dollar" for example is not real US Dollar. It is their own so called "BTC-E-Dollar". So there might be a gap where taxing could be easily avoided until it is finally cashed out in real money and flowing into your bank account without getting into problems. Or even 100% tax free if you keep it as a digital currency like that and don't cash out.

This might be a good advice for new traders:
1) Buy at a price that fits for you. (Never invest what you can't afford to lose)
2) Think about what you are willing to sale (keep it realistic).
3) Set your sell order at that price.
4) Patience. Even if it takes weeks.
5) Do NOT make news change your mind.
6) Sell order gets filled.
 
If you think "But it's so high/low! What if price-X doesn't come back!" you might want to keep in mind: History repeats. This doesn't mean there's a high chance we'll see $0.50 again. But you know (and see) what I mean.
 
There are traders that started with small amounts, didn't break their rules of non-emotional trading and are sitting on Bitcoin worth 6 or 7 digits in USD. Some of them needed 2 years of trading.
 
I've had many conversations with these type of traders. All ended with exactly the same advice. 
Keep your emotions out of the game. If it helps you may consider staying away from pricecharts a bit. Smartphone Apps with Price alerts can tell you when your price has been reached. Chill, take some time off from exchanges that you waste on waiting and you'll see.
P.S.: There's some malicious price alert application going around, do a Google search on it. In my case I only use "Price Alert" on iOS made by "jjangg96s". Android + Win/Mac Apps might need some Google research.
Edit: Not _everyone_ should aim for insane profits. Sometimes small returns are great too. If you notice you are losing more and more money because of your trading behaviour, here is a very important message for you which may sound hard but: Maybe trading is not for you and you should learn about mistakes. Mistakes are okay. But in the end everyone should realize what he can do and what he can't.
Edit2: Bad grammar, I know.
Tl;dr: Read the whole thing man, don't be lazy and expect a good advice as a Tl;dr. Just read it.

Aw man, didn't have any of these experiences with stolen BTC yet. But I hope you can get your money back soon. Reading this makes me hate some people on this planet.
A bit Offtopic: I only mine my Bitcoins and store them in some encrypted containers to keep them save. Opening the wallet keeps me busy for several hours because the wallet password is so damn complicated.
I have never done any transactions from my wallet and sadly don't know enough about that. But reading this already gives me a headaches thinking of problems that may come up in the future.
Even more Offtopic: My grammar sucks. Feel free to correct my mistakes, willing to learn!
Edit: I think Bitcoins can't be just "gone", since it's traceable and what not. Am I right?

Sorry to be that guy but: Very very bad advice.
Do _NOT_ store your coins on web wallets or in exchanges.
Just check how much coins got stolen in the past and how it happened... For the love of god, guys - don't do this.
@_date: 2013-11-23 11:52:00
Okay, I am doing that step now too.
Starting to work on a promotional Video for my business now to communicate that I'll be accepting Bitcoin as well. :)
I think it may be a good step.
 
My business is not related in food at all, but anyway. I think every new business that is thinking about accepting Bitcoin is doing something good for helping Bitcoin in general! Tell your friends as well, teach them about Bitcoin and what our goal for the next years is!

What are your plans for accepting alt coins like PPC, DEM and so on? There are many people out there that like to see some more different alt coins on more trustworthy (and good looking) services like kraken.
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:50:15
Depending on where you live and a few more details: Talk to someone like a lawyer that can confirm you if you need to pay taxes on every single trade! Otherwise it could end up with a very bad tax szenario for some traders. Very bad. (Repeat that for yourself: Taxing every trade. Every. Damn. Trade.)
I think the story with the guy who shot himself because of the taxes is reason enought to take 1-2 hours to consult a lawyer about this. (As far as I remember the problem he had was about taxed trading moves)
 
/Edit: It doesn't matter if you trade with a small amount or a truckload of BTC/USD/EUR. Please get professional advice outside of the Internet first. We are going to see horrorstory-threads of traders with "bad luck" in relation to taxed trades in the future - just try to save your own ass from not being the OP of one of these threads.
/Edit2: Fuck my grammar. Damn. Anyway, hope you get my message anyway.
Think, get some professional advice and then act. Especially when you live in Europe. I think USA might have some problem with taxed trades too. Alaska should be fine. But I don't really know, seeing my lawyer this week for my case. (Germany)

Made my day.
 
Opening my casino with 0.25 BTC in 2020, is invited! Location: On BitDewd-Island of course. Which I will buy from some shady guy for 0.30 BTC. Who bought it for 600 bazillion Feathercoins before. Of course.
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:44:13
Didn't want to scare you.
Just be careful.
I'm not a tax lawyer or anything near that.
I just read something here and there and became aware that it might get traders into trouble depending on the trader's location.
 
I could be so wrong in some way in relation to trades that make profit and have to be taxed individually. But you know.. Not every trader has the same situation. Some are trading from a different country, maybe trading in the name of their company and more complicated stuff that might come together, as soon as it's cashed out.
 
Just take care and know 100% of what you do.
I realized that I maybe made some mistakes in trading and I'm just happy that I realized it within weeks and not after a year or something like that. I am going to see my lawyer this week to get the information I need for my case. He may also charge me a percentage of my profit I make or maybe he even does it on a fixed pricing base. I will see...
 
When money comes into play, things may get more complicated as they sound at first.
 
Sure, there is a possibility on gambling with getting away tax free - but if they catch you, it's going to cost you much much more than you expect. I am not interested in gambling with tax authorities, I want to do it the right way when it comes to taxes.
 
If my lawyer confirms my situation gets me every profit making trade taxed - well, I guess I have to minimize the amounts of future trades and think about every move.
 
Just be as careful as you can. Again: Trading means getting money for the most of us. And some tax authorities are interested in your fresh profits. Bank account incomes that are more than value xx.xxx may also automatically raise some kind of "red flag" which makes your bank tell the tax authorities about the unusual income by law.
 
/Edit: If you read somewhere "Country xx accepts Bitcoin and is very happy &amp; proud to be a part of the Bitcoin generation, hurray!" it doesn't mean you are 100% tax free on what you do when it comes to trading. Sure they may be happy to have something new that can be taxed...
 
/Edit2: A big factor is also if you even _can_ provide a full trading history or if there is a way for authorities for getting it by themselves. As I said. I don't know, gambling with these fellas won't end good.. For example being fined for $10k for trying to evade taxes on $2-3k like profit without even knowing can hurt like fuck and is some kind of a "once in a lifetime tax lesson".

The fact that the identity of the author is unknown makes it look a bit scary.
I don't know if I can trust this to put in my coins and store it for years via paper wallet.
I can't run bitcoin-qt, multibit, armory or similar wallets in a safe way because of hardware and software reasons.
So the offline method of using bitaddress is the only way for me I think. Hope I can trust it since I can't read/review code at all....

But I guess I will have to have the fresh new machine with a clean new installed OS (Linux, debian in my case) connect to the internet once for:
 
- downloading the Armory wallet application. Transfering it via USB stick from an online machine doesnt sound like a solution for me, that gives trojans and keyloggers a weak spot to attack! So I have to get it from somewhere. Not everyone has 2 machines to do a wallet-installer transfer (binary or source, doesnt matter) from one clean machine to another. So I'd better download the wallet application from 1 clean machine where my wallet is being generated and synced once than buying another machine to just download it, which I can't afford. I also don't trust USB sticks a single move. (Using VMs is insecure.)
 
- syncing the Wallet with the network (see explanation below)
 
- generating my wallet ID online. If I do this completely offline how should the Bitcoin network "know" that my wallet has been created? Maybe also somebody else could generate that wallet ID with online synced wallet that I created a few years later if dont go online ever with it
 
I not that deep into creating a cold wallet, that's why I'm posting my concerns here on Reddit. I am thinking about the above problems for ages now. I would be very very happy if someone with experience could do a detailed reply to this.
 
I need to get the 3 problems above solved for a Litecoin, Bitcoin, Peercoin and Feathercoin wallet for cold storage with Linux. As far as I know PPC, FTC and LTC only have good working clients for Linux. I don't know if armory does work any good on a Linux OS. I tried building the wallets on my Raspberry Pi from the sources or download the binaries, even tried to cross compile (friends tried it, I'm new to Linux), nothing didn't work. Didn't get one single wallet to work on the newest Raspbian (wheezy) OS, fully up to date installed with all needed resources..
 
 
P.S.: Im currently using blockchain and wallets on an insecure WIN-PC for temporary trading transfers. Blockchain with 2 factor auth, because of my geo location I can't order and receive on of blockchains hardware authenticators And most of my coins are on BTC-E with 2 factor auth too, for trading. But one day, I have to get them out of the web to have them stored in cold wallets!
 
Please help Reddit... Don't want to end up losing everything.
 
 
/Edit: I have met a guy with above 1 million USD in bitcoins (a few days ago when the price was just below $200. Now he's even richer) all stored on blockchain.info for a long time and he said he's not thinking about pulling them out. But he told me to put my BTC into a cold wallet, which sounded paradoxical to me. He gave an advice to a newcomer-trader while he as a self made millionaire trader seems to not give a shit about that advice when it comes to his own money.
