To the moon?  It's the future?  It's not like a fish, it's all the fish, and it's metaphors.  Not just train metaphors and fish metaphors, but sports metaphors, too.  Bitcoin can't lose!
Yeah, content would have been nice, right?

Yeah, hopefully they don't cash out for cash immediately, hopefully they play along a bit, send some back and forth to each other, and buy beer from each other with it.

I know that if I was there I'd be selling beer for bitcoins -- for many people it would be FREE BEER.  And people love FREE BEER.  And then I'd have bitcoins.
If anyone has online stores that take bitcoins, around MIT would be a good place to put up posters.

Just head on over to btcjam (and probably others) and you can get a bitcoin loan.  Maybe.  Eventually.
You might also pay it back.  In my experience you might not.

There's the problem -- if you were a talented enough programmer, you'd likely have trouble remembering to shower, and be offended that marketing is half the equation and upset that most people are stupid enough to not know something good when some neckbeard presents it to them.*
Which is why the talented programmers need to team up with user interface, marketing, and design people.
*stereotypes, but a little like being upset that the ducks are quacking.

Yeah, it's actually all very complicated -- they say it's untraceable and anonymous, then go on to say that Paypal is the largest company.  I think the whole concept needs some background and caveats thrown in to their explanations.

I suspect that Bitcoin will never be something that most people use.  I suspect that use of Bitcoin will become less frequent among current users.  I also suspect that it could have a HUGE future in money transfers because that is an area where people are getting screwed and Bitcoin provides some very compelling solutions to the problems.

I had always assumed that the big problem with accepting money for adult sites was the regret-chargebacks.  Bitcoin takes care of those pretty well.  Sounds like a golden business opportunity for someone.
Monthly recurring charges aren't easy to set up, though.

50btc don't have a graph for it, but they do have a nice box showing the difficulty changes (on their website it shows if the changes are up or down with an arrow):
30.04	10076293		12.28%
17.04	8974296		16.96%
05.04	7673000		14.59%
24.03	6695826		38.13%
14.03	4847647		10.98%
01.03	4367876		19.63%
18.02	3651012		11.47%
05.02	3275465		10.33%
23.01	2968775		8.64% (decrease)

+1 smart!
The lack of inflation in bitcoin is going to be one of the interesting parts to watch play out.  The way it tweaks really core principles of economics is one thing I don't think has been looked at enough.  It would make for a good mid-upper level college econ class.

"In the bitcoin world, we love regulation."

There's also the problem that some VERY basic information isn't widespread -- people know what bitcoins are at this point, and maybe how to send and receive them, but not easily, and there doesn't seem to be much easy to use information about how to deal with having a wallet on your computer that contains your bitcoins which are actually valuable at this point.
@_date: 2013-05-03 21:51:32
And if you've got a decent video card, at this point it's still easily possible to mine $15/month worth!

Most of the work for bitcoin is artificial, and not just to generate blocks -- the difficulty is inflated on purpose.

Well there is a plum tree on my road that is along the sidewalk and produces edible plums.  Selling my plums naked for bitcoin sounds like a euphemism.

Just the thread I need!
Q:  Where are my bitcoins?  I have been mining on 50btc and transferred some of my bitcoin balance to an address from multibit, which is running on my computer right here.
So....  They've been sent, I can see in the block chain explorer, but they haven't shown up in multibit yet.
It's been two hours.
@_date: 2013-05-03 16:14:58
Very good point.
For BTC 0.02 I will compose a limerick for you.
That's an end to end transaction, but not really tangible.
@_date: 2013-06-24 20:42:59
Yeah, no one can stab you and take your cash on the internet.  Much more fun when you end up with, ok, let's be honest, it's not going to be a knife that gets brought to this gunfight...er, robbe... I mean, transaction!
@_date: 2013-05-14 14:16:03
Well.... maybe?  But it is doing SOMETHING that could potentially, maybe, possibly not be useless, as long as "detecting potential signals from space" has value, which I think it does.
Short term, propagating a digital currency certainly is more of an outcome than "nope, no aliens"
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:56:19
Only sort of -- it's 68.4% more dense than lead, so it does get used in armor-piercing ammunition.  But not to explode.  But both could ruin your day.
@_date: 2013-05-14 14:55:15
Very true --  coming up with an appropriate work metric would be very hard, and having pluggable "work" of various sorts is nearly unmanagable -- another problem I just thought of is that the bitcoin "work" is basically self-contained.  Most other data processing work like that would require some central source of the information to be worked on, which would be insecure.  It might be a problem without a solution, but hopefully the smart people are working on it.  
Well that, and I imagine CureCoin (the cryptocoin that fights cancer! proof of work is genes or proteins or whatnot, and 5% of coins generated go to cancer research) would be popular and have immediate public sentiment behind it.
@_date: 2013-05-14 14:21:24
Wouldn't it be better if the difficulty was 40 protein sequences decoded and the current block's hash or the equivalent?  I'm just saying that "proof of work" doesn't need to be work for work's sake for any hard reason.
@_date: 2013-06-25 16:01:58
Here's the sort of thing that makes very little sense to me -- Why would you make it bitcoin exclusive, when using bitcoins is still more difficult in many cases than using dollars?
The idea seems to be "I'll make netflix streaming, convince all of the content providers to license globally, not have a payment method that is either easy or facilitates monthly recurring billing, and ... profit" ?
Unless you're sitting on several million dollars, it doesn't seem like a profitable scheme.
Where is the benefit to the subscriber?
@_date: 2013-05-14 14:13:01
Right now the difficulty changes in mining are basically adding leading zeroes to the thing that needs to be found, which makes it much harder to find.  Yes there is a very good point to it all, but wouldn't it be better if rather than finding zeroes to pin at the front of the work, it was protein folding data?  I'm just thinking that there has to be a "hard" problem that is easily verified and impossible to fake that could be used rather than the current bumping of difficulty.
