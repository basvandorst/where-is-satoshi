All they can really do is impose capital gains taxes. 
Should the government decide to set up its own “official” crypto and force people out of cash, the exchange will be so weak that people will never do it. They’ll continue to work outside the “system” using bitcoin or some other crypto. I wouldn’t worry about anything.

You are aware that there are TEN time zones in Russia right? The soviets didn’t have an archetypal “Soviet man.” They have Chinese looking russians. Mongolian looking russians.
