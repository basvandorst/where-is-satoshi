Roger Ver scam site.
@_date: 2018-11-23 05:15:28
I hope Ver and Wright have hired security detail...
Someone is going to come after them.
That having been said, if all it takes is those 2 idiots to take down bitcoin, it ain't worth shit.

He looks like a Nigerian scam artist.  He worked for one of the world's largest banks, Citigroup.
They were fined $100 million for manipulation:
is not a bright person or is part of the problem.
@_date: 2018-11-26 20:15:11
Not him again.
@_date: 2018-11-21 07:14:10
Dude, stop trying to make your site happen.  It's not going to happen independent of angles you try.
@_date: 2018-11-28 01:47:54
No, it's not a panacea but, Jesus fucking Christ,  you've got to start somewhere.  Early adoption costs of pretty much all new tech is shouldered by early adopters.
So sick of the ignorant damned if they do, damned if they don't arguments here. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 07:20:06
Go away.  You are annoying.  Seriously, go away.
@_date: 2018-11-22 03:04:34
You may be the fucktard in this instance given you cannot seem to read...  No where does the OP in the screenshot say he sold.
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:14:43
This happens every few years and is what happens when you have a relative few people on various exchanges effectively regulating monetary policy-which I am NOT a fan of.
That does not make it a pyramid scheme.  
@_date: 2018-11-21 06:21:42
Officially, no.  Pretty much nobody globally cares about the others.
Roger Ver is essentially a used car salesman and Craig Wright is a complete fraud with delusions of grandeur.
Even his mother, apparently, has commented on the fact:
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:29:58
This is fucking dumb.
@_date: 2018-11-30 22:59:45
An unusually high volume of external transfers may require that they access cold storage.
Given that it's, based on my understanding, multi-factor and distributed around the world, it's not necessarily a quick process to access it.
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:00:03
Is there a hit out on Craig Wright yet?
@_date: 2018-11-30 20:28:32
Yeah, you are now blocked so I don't need to see your posts anymore.
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:27:17
Another worthless opinion.
I wager, based on my crystal ball, that we are looking at a drop to between 2 and 2.5k in the near term.
Jack shit is going to happen in terms of appreciation until UX is dumbed down Apple style for everyone.

Jeff Bezos owns a ton of Amazon stock...
Whomever Satoshi is/are put a number of ideas together to solve an old computer problem.  That solution was put out into the wild for people to do whatever they wanted to do.
Some understand the implications and see the potential for a positive impact on humanity.  Some think they are going to be wealthy and don't give a shit about anything else.
Bright people understand the implications.  Con-artists copy it.  Stupid or uneducated people call it a pyramid scheme.
You are of the latter category, unfortunately.  I'm sure your mommy told you you are a genius though just like most everyone else's.
@_date: 2018-11-21 07:15:30
His opinion is worthless.  
He has lost all credibility.
Ignore him and move on.

The exact opposite of anything Tom Lee says is what will happen.

Roger Ver scam site.
@_date: 2018-11-22 03:06:23
Nope.  No recommendation was given.  You also fail at reading comprehension.
In fact, the response to OP was to sell.
@_date: 2018-11-30 00:54:24
You took this image straight from the Medium article that was already posted.  All the people are the fucking same.
What a tool you are.  Username DOES NOT check out.
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:36:55
He's a clown.
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:22:31

Scam site owned by Ver.
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:52:05
You really need to stop posting about what you do not understand.  You look foolish.
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:59:43
Nobody has promised anything to anyone, genius.
This is an experiment and could very well completely fail.
However, I'm sure you are brighter than what the world considers some the brightest minds in tech who are working on developing it. /s
I think it's going to be crashed to between 2 &amp; 2.5k USD in the near future.  I also believe it will recover relatively quickly - 2-3 years.
McAfee will be eating his dick on a live stream very soon.  I will give you that.

Just my opinion.

You.  Hope you got a discount for not only the plate frame but also a decal with the dealership name.
@_date: 2018-11-21 03:46:44
That's why Arthur Hayes doesn't give a fuck what the price is and why they issued a notice that USA, Canada, etc cannot hold positions with Bitmex:
Dude looks like a Nigerian scammer.

@_date: 2018-11-25 08:23:01
Thanks for your input, genius.
Next time a red candle across every single global exchange occurs simultaneously I'll make a post here letting everyone know that you knew more than me about this market, bots and unregulated wash trading.
You are annoying.  Stop posting here.
@_date: 2018-11-29 22:55:23

@_date: 2018-11-22 03:35:48
So, I'm supposed to search for the rest of the thread that you didn't link to in order to validate the point you failed to make?
Pass.  You're a tool.
@_date: 2018-11-21 07:54:30
He is an old man who doesn't want to eat his own dick.
Humor him, I suppose.

Here comes 2500...  
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:38:22
This post "MAY" have been made by this lovely person from jail:
@_date: 2018-11-29 07:39:31
Agreed.  My crystal ball tells me we are looking at around $2500 within the next couple months. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:34:07
No.  Even if it was, it would still pale in comparison to the US Dollar.
@_date: 2018-11-22 03:50:01
LOL.  You fail at life.
@_date: 2018-11-28 01:54:14

I won't be surprised if it's @ 2500 USD within a week.
He'll still be up...
If this actually works, I'd wager it'll take at least another decade.  
@_date: 2018-11-30 20:21:12
Dude, I'm getting tired of your shit.  You are one annoying and insulting motherfucker.
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:21:58

Just no.

It's backed by war.

The author of this article, Tyler, has no idea what he is writing about.
Craig Wright is a fraud and what he does has nothing to do with bitcoin/Bitcoin.
Further, the only short-term  effect it (the bcash fork) may have had is some divested temporarily to short "the SV fork." 
It's not bitcoin.

Along with Tom Lee (among others).
@_date: 2018-11-30 20:36:42
This guy is a clown and nothing more.  He has zero credibility in my mind.
@_date: 2018-11-21 03:30:23
Your post is worthless.  Even your phonegrab (or whatever) indicates a delay/change in launch date.
The CEO of Bakkt posted a delay notice today:
@_date: 2018-11-28 03:46:22
Tom Lee is a clown who has proven himself to be nearly unconditionally wrong...  He needs to go away like Vinny Lingham.
Given that Lee has, apparently, made this new "prediction" in lieu of revising his 2018 EOY forecast from 15k USD to 5k, etc - plan on a year long bear market and drop to sub 1k levels.  =P
