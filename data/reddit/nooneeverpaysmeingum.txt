I used to work for one of Ingram Micro's competitors as a Credit Analyst. Every now and again we would have to request current (ish) financial statements so we can conduct a review of the company to see if their current credit limit is appropriate given the companies current financial situation. Companies with higher credit limits get reviewed more often than others.  
If I received a financial statement that has Bitcoin mentioned, I would absolutely write that off as a intangible asset for the business. It might as well of not of been there in the first place. In the end we look at the Tangible Net Worth, we leave out all of the intangibles. 
And it's all about covering my ass. If I review a company, and they go under, all the higher ups will be looking at who reviewed them and  approved their credit line. It's hard to explain to a Senior VP of Credit that Bitcoins are a commodity and should be treated as such when you are weighing a decision on an account. They won't care. They will be looking for someone to blame, and it will be me. 
So as soon as the higher ups come around, which Bitcoins need to be more stable for them to even consider it (Credit managers are extremely risk adverse), this will be the case: People like me too scared to take Bitcoins seriously on a Balance Sheet/Income Statement because shit rolls downhill.

It's what the stock people call a "correction to the long term yield"

Cliff: Some NPR guy came on the show telling people not to buy BTC

Haha it was pretty expected. The guy was from NPR which suggest he has an older audience. Older people shouldn't be skeptical with their money, so it is typical for this guy to come out against it.
My position on BTC is pretty short term, so I was hoping for a little positive info. But well see what the market does
