What about the idea that people will be giving cryptos as ang bao (red envelope gifts) to their relatives?
That should push prices up, not down.
That's what we saw pre-Christmas.
This feels like a backwards calculated excuse for the current dip.

I'm saying if the market was going up, we woudl see posts saying "it's going up because people are giving Crypto gifts for CNY.
I live in Asia.
I know Crypto holders.
I know none that are selling for CNY.

I looked at the graphs.
I'd say the crypto market in 2018 is nothing like 2014.
There are far more weak hands in the market today compared to 2014.

Hahaha that was a happy mistake.

Is there somewhere to see the ATH from GDAX?

Whats your gripe with ETH?
Just out of interest.

How big is your short?
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:36:31
Of course.
There does seem to be some stigma that crypto investors are not sophisticated investors and are basically 4chan or WoW kids that found a Bloomberg terminal.
I'd expect strong and differing opinions.

For all their failings, Binance actually has by far the best crypto/finance learning platform, and its totally free to use.
