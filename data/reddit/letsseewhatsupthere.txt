It's not just part of a marketing plan. PeerTracks is a separate DAC running the BitShares code; it's not part of BTS. The PeerTracks Music Player will compete with Apple, Amazon, and Google right off the bat. And the artist coin concept is something brand new that no one has done before.

Sample letter (feel free to customize)
Dear Senator Manchin,
I have always admired your bipartisan leadership. However, your recent open letter in opposition to Bitcoin struck me as extremely uninformed and full of mistaken assumptions. Bitcoin and other digital currencies can help millions of Americans make payments without being beholden to high credit card fees. It is actually less anonymous than using cash for transactions; cash will always be an easier way to launder money. 
In addition, Silicon Valley venture capitalists, who I believe have helped fund some of your past campaigns, are pouring money into developing companies and applications which provide a trustworthy infrastructure for digital payment systems built around Bitcoin. There is more Silicon Valley investment into Bitcoin companies right now than almost any other segment of technology. By opposing this innovation, you are mistakenly going to cost jobs and tax revenue for millions of law abiding Americans in West Virginia and other states. State regulators in NY and throughout the country are hard at work developing common sense regulations to prevent money-laundering through digital currencies, so this will not be an issue when the new regulations come out. Please reconsider your ill-advised stance and announce that you (like Senator Tom Carper of Delaware) are eager to see what innovations Bitcoin can bring. It can be a force for good in the world. --Sincerely, _____

Ultimately, the market is Darwinian. But as more money continues flowing into Bitcoin, the rising tide should lift a lot of boats. We may not have even seen the beginning of the Gold Rush into cryptos. So it could be many months or years before the market sorts out winners/losers and we really know which of these will succeed. I'm betting there will be a handful of successful digital currencies, not just one.

These online stock newsletters are looking too hard to try and find a Bitcoin-related investment. Some people actually think these guys are cool if they appear to be trendy, and thus they discuss the one or two BTC-related stocks they can find, which they think is trendy. But the few publicly traded companies in this space are really underwhelming as investments. I would suggest some better choices might be some of the upcoming companies in the Bitshares product line, one of the exchanges that you like, Neo &amp; Bee, or one of the other Havelock stocks or funds like SFI, etc. Those all have true growth potential and are fairly solid in terms of reliability. The only downside of a non-publicly traded company is that the SEC cannot protect you as well if the thing disappears due to fraud (but you still wouldn't see your money again even if a publicly traded stock zeroed out on you).  
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:42:51
Yes, no one in their right mind will stick with Gox, even if they can become functional again. I think the market has been pricing this in. What I don't know is how long it will take for the malaise to pass. People are probably waiting for Gox traders/depositors to be able to get their Bitcoin/fiats out. 
The irony is that if these are locked up, the remaining Bitcoin ought to be SO much more valuable. Just imagine if one of the OPEC countries held up all deposits and oil barrels...you think the market would crash? The price of oil would explode! That tells me we haven't created a functional demand for BTC just yet.

Mastercoin is obsolete. I think NXT is the best of this bunch, having a great headstart and enough momentum to establish some leadership as a decentralized exchange. Ethereum is a cool concept if they can come up with an IPO that doesn't smack of Wall Street--probably less money to be made speculating with Ethereum than with NXT, which has the most promise.

I don't take exception with your statement that it doesn't help Bitcoin.

You're wise to do so. Most coins are crap. Keep an eye on the Proof of Stakes, though, such as Blackcoin and Peercoin, since they have a much lower inflation rate.

In the current environment, yes. Long term, assuming Bitcoin and/or these other systems grow, then I think they'll really help each other. Each of these will have a different audience and bring in new people to the crypto world. Also, I think very few of these systems are going to be denominated in fiat currency (unless they can comply with Money Service Business regulations, which are burdensome and expensive). They'll be denominated in some kind of Monopoly money, probably Bitcoin, and that helps increase the overall market cap.

They're all working on Bitcoin integration themselves. We've seen pieces of evidence of this for many months now. If/when they will adopt it, who knows, but they have smart people working for them who probably can figure out how to plug Bitcoin into those companies' existing infrastructure. 
If that doesn't go well or if Bitpay/Coinbase, etc. really has something attractive that they need, then yes, they will buy those companies. I think this action would make the most sense for Paypal, which would gain the exploding customer base and business model of a Bitpay, while I'm not as sure that Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Google, etc. would automatically want to grow into the payment sector. 
There's a difference between finding a functional plug-in payment processor for one's core business and actually taking on a whole new business of providing payment processing services for clients. Although that could be attractive to them in its own right.

Sample letter (feel free to customize)
Dear Senator Manchin,
I have always admired your bipartisan leadership. However, your recent open letter in opposition to Bitcoin struck me as extremely uninformed and full of mistaken assumptions. Bitcoin and other digital currencies can help millions of Americans make payments without being beholden to high credit card fees. It is actually less anonymous than using cash for transactions; cash will always be an easier way to launder money. 
In addition, Silicon Valley venture capitalists, who I believe have helped fund some of your past campaigns, are pouring money into developing companies and applications which provide a trustworthy infrastructure for digital payment systems built around Bitcoin. There is more Silicon Valley investment in Bitcoin companies right now than almost any other segment of technology. By opposing this innovation, you are mistakenly going to cost jobs and tax revenue for millions of law abiding Americans in West Virginia and other states. State regulators in NY and throughout the country are hard at work developing common sense regulations to prevent money-laundering through digital currencies, so this will not be an issue when the new regulations come out. Please reconsider your ill-advised stance and announce that you (like Senator Tom Carper of Delaware) are eager to see what innovations Bitcoin can bring. It can be a force for good in the world. --Sincerely, _____

[3.21] fire incident currency net: about 3.21 events after the treatment program
Time: March 22, 2014 17:32:39 Source: Fire coins Network
Dear fire coins network users:
3.21 Event Description: at 18:19 on March 21 points microblogging called "fiscal Newswire" release "the central bank on March 18 issued a document calling on April 15 to stop all Bitcoin transactions "message, followed by Sina Finance and some big V account forwarding, after a lot of network media, triggering panic in the market. There are a lot of selling in a short time, causing prices have fallen sharply, causing part of the domestic borrowing multiple trading platforms users forced liquidation. Such incidents are not new, have appeared before the foreign trading platforms over multiple levers. The most famous one was on February 10 this year, well-known foreign trading platform BTC-E being MTGOX not mention bitcoin spreads the message, instant platform Bitcoin price from $ 719 down to $ 105, resulting in a large number of users are forced borrowing level positions. In the traditional futures markets, such events more often.
Lower than the price on the deal: Because the system commissioned to sell when the price in the market, lack of LTC pay system below, can not be traded, so the final price lower than the closing price. When closing the sale of LTC insufficient to repay the borrowing system, even a small amount of borrowing will cause a user's asset liability.
Network 1 yuan coins on fire LTC: Fire coins network formally launched on March 19 LTC, from 3.21 event just two days time, the market is not deep enough. In the case of market panic, the price deviation pending fewer larger price range, the system can not open the regular price until the price falls to 1 yuan before closing completed.
Users questioned about whether to participate in the fire coins network events: In the whole process, all transactions are in accordance with the fire and open trade agreements and currency net open mechanism, fire currency network in the whole process did not participate in the market (if participation LTC platform market would not let the price of new on-line two days fell to 1 yuan, the credibility of the platform, causing a great deal of negative injury), net currency buyers and sellers are user-generated fire.
1, we request Weibo truthfully announce "fiscal Newswire" this account registration, login, IP and binding common identity and other information, the fire damaged coins on behalf of the user network will send a lawyer's letter to this account, so that rumor mongers to accept legal sanctions!
2,1 yuan to buy LTC users, the network is completely normal users to buy credits fire. There are already some users on the microblogging drying them cheap to buy LTC transaction records, and also welcomes more cheap to buy LTC users sun transaction, thank you. In addition, we will also communicate with the user's consent, will announce more details of low-paying users, such as buying records and contact information. Image details visit: 
Fire currency net liability in the matter: although the whole incident was caused by the outside world, and the whole process was not involved in the fire Net official currency market, but the fire coins network in the whole process is not in place there is indeed a risk control responsibilities, LTC wind Control is a reference BTC to do, but in fact the liquidity gap between the two species is large, this really is our lack of on-line transactions LTC preparatory work. Facts have proved that either yesterday or last year, when the event fell 12.5 fire BTC currency net price system is very stable, without any exceptions.
How to deal with ======================= ======================
Fire currency handling for this event:
1, the first time yesterday, we've upgraded the LTC risk control strategy to ensure that a similar situation does not occur in the future rose fell when.
2, buy low for successful trading yesterday, currency net legal department confirmed that the fire is completely legal compliance is everyone's legitimate assets. Fire coins network users not entitled to limit withdrawals, etc. This part of the operation, of course, we hope that we can release the transaction shots yesterday to let everyone know that you bought the currency is not the currency network black fire everyone's money, thank you.
3, fire currency network based on the user responsible attitude this morning after discussion with all the shareholders, decided to come to the part of the user to the risk of forced liquidation of compensation from the company's risk reserve, the whole idea is to reference normal market price on the closing price correction, the difference between the loss in part by the platform's risk reserve to bear.
Fire currency risk compensation network specific measures:
1, yesterday afternoon 18:46-18:55 within this period of time, all open systems prices below $ 70 flat warehouse, according to the platform exit price of $ 70 re-settlement;
2, after the re-settlement account balance remains negative account that part of the platform will be exempt arrears account, account assets do zero processing (ie 70 yuan positions still owe platform borrower's account that part of the platform due to a one-time exemption models);
3, each will fire coins News Service Day at 3.24-3.26 phone associated with the user to confirm the solution, within days of the appropriate treatment of the account after a call to confirm, please be patient treatment.
Meanwhile, once again reminded supporters and data currency trader, digital currency transactions and traditional sophisticated financial products different, there are several features:
1, open markets, global linkage. This feature is determined that we can not unilaterally go drop as time restrictions and opened like a traditional financial exchanges, and even influence the design of the fuse mechanism;
2, liquidity is not strong. Currently digital currency liquidity is not high enough, relatively low liquidity brought about a high risk of financial derivative products, especially in addition to other digital currencies other than BTC, poor mobility should be a relatively level;
3, policy instability. Digital currency as a new phenomenon, the global financial and economic policies greater impact, and the policy is not a trading platform for other industries and commercial organizations to harness predict price objective to bring greater digital currency fluctuations.
Finally, once again yesterday for the user to do more leverage involved in LTC apologize for the future will be more powerful fire currency network, the development of digital currency will be more perfect. Growth in learning, strong in the face of adversity, we work with the digital currency industry!

I agree it would be simpler for some people. But I see some big problems. First of all, it would be tremendously wasteful, because bills would be single use only. And second, the minute somebody comes up with a good bill, the counterfeiters crank up their machines. There are even counterfeits of the Casascius coins going around now. Governments spend millions to protect against this. Not that these can't be spotted and distinguished, but one reason cryptocurrencies are so effective is their mathematical reliability...which essentially is lost as soon as you make a physical version.

The Feds are good at railroading people this way, shooting first and asking questions (or just dismissing charges) later, once the person's life has been ruined. I work in the legal field and I've seen it happen many times. That said, and having read that indictment, I don't find the charges against Shrem to be insignificant at all. Yes, the big banks are far more crooked on a large scale and they get away with it because they run the economy. But that does not trivialize what he is accused of doing. He's entitled to a strong defense and I wish him the best. But based on what I read, there's smoke there.

I think Bitcoin has a lot of momentum. There are better choices now, such as some of the Proof of Stake coins, which ultimately lead to less centralization. Will any of them supplant Bitcoin? I'd say Bitcoin would need to experience more problems than this for that to occur. 
What I do think will happen is that Bitcoin, though useful as a currency, ultimately will be surpassed in importance by one or more of the 2.0 innovations which do a lot more with the blockchain than just currency. My best guess is Bitshares with all that it has in the works. 
And if that happens, then whatever base currencies are used in this system could be in much greater demand (being ultimately more useful) than Bitcoin. That will be especially true if they do not include mining, which eats up all the transaction fees and requires a terrific amount of resources to sustain Bitcoin.

You're operating on the premise that price feeds are the main element of BitUSD. In fact, the market holds the peg and has done a steady job of this since BitShares X began floating the BitAssets. BitUSD has tracked the underlying commodity market very faithfully, just at a discount due to its limited utility thusfar. The price feeds are a minor tweak to allow the system to work well with limited market depth. In a very short time, those tweaks will be irrelevant, as this system is set to debut in earnest. Bear in mind, everything we've seen so far has been beta testing. With greater volume, the market in BitShares X will set everything.

Sample letter (feel free to customize)
Dear Senator Manchin,
I have always admired your bipartisan leadership. However, your recent open letter in opposition to Bitcoin struck me as extremely uninformed and full of mistaken assumptions. Bitcoin and other digital currencies can help millions of Americans make payments without being beholden to high credit card fees. It is actually less anonymous than using cash for transactions; cash will always be an easier way to launder money. 
In addition, Silicon Valley venture capitalists, who I believe have helped fund some of your past campaigns, are pouring money into developing companies and applications which provide a trustworthy infrastructure for digital payment systems built around Bitcoin. There is more Silicon Valley investment into Bitcoin companies right now than almost any other segment of technology. By opposing this innovation, you are mistakenly going to cost jobs and tax revenue for millions of law abiding Americans in West Virginia and other states. State regulators in NY and throughout the country are hard at work developing common sense regulations to prevent money-laundering through digital currencies, so this will not be an issue when the new regulations come out. Please reconsider your ill-advised stance and announce that you (like Senator Tom Carper of Delaware) are eager to see what innovations Bitcoin can bring. It can be a force for good in the world. --Sincerely, _____

Excellent. Hopefully, you're the "A-team". There's a big market for an exchange that does things right: plays honestly, hires good programmers, and bases itself in a country with some regulatory clarity regarding crptocurrencies. To focus on East Asia, I would suggest basing it in Singapore, Australia, or South Korea, which seem like the most favorable places there right now. I don't think I'll be putting any of my money in an exchange headquartered in a country that hasn't expressed regulatory clarity for crypto-currencies or won't tell me where it's based. And I'd rather disclose my identity to a government than trust my money to some anonymous exchange.

Credits could work. I think the pay-per-view model works well. But aren't they making more from charging subscriptions to people who don't fully use them? A pay-per-view model could bring them lots of extra business, especially if they are avoiding credit card fees with Bitcoin, but they might worry about the losses from an eroding subscription base. The recurring payment thing is still an issue with Bitcoin, though there may be ways around it. I do think Netflix will implement Bitcoin, but I don't see them drastically changing their business model when they do. A subscriber will probably be able to pre-pay for a year's subscription or something like that.

I think it's mainly the Chinese deadline of Jan. 31 for the new regulations. Even if that's been priced in, I think people are wary of buying because they know things may drop over the next few days. There may be another spike or two before then, but basically I see it losing a little value until this period is over. 
But I think that, come February, there will be a collective sigh of relief and a return to the general optimism. However, it could flatline for awhile until the infrastructure gets built out with all these start-ups and/or until the biggies (Amazon, eBay, Google, Walmart, Target, Apple, etc.) really get in. Because let's face it, the pool of users is not growing astronomically overnight. It will take time to mature.

It's not really stupid, though. An oil merchant in a volatile Middle Eastern country might sell oil at a discount because of the added security and risk premium.

Same thing here.

You're asking the White House to have a Senate vote? Do you understand the Senate is within the Legislative Branch and the White House is in the Executive Branch? Constitutionally, they cannot make each other do things. The President has no power and cannot introduce legislation or force a vote in the Senate. FYI, the House of Reps votes on things that are popular all the time when there is an election (they have to get elected every two years), but most of those populist ideas die in the Senate. They can take the long view since they are only elected every six years.

I think any one of those alternatives could represent an improvement. I agree it is a matter of time before they all have digitally backed currencies. Mexico's government is usually heavily indebted to the U.S., not only financially but politically. So I doubt they have the power to break from the international financial system in such a way. I'm guessing it will be smaller, fringe countries that start this trend, unless someone like China or Russia surprises everyone and jumps in.

That is noble of you to decline the interview. Everyone here should do the same, given the way they butchered Erik's comments.

I also appreciated reading your earlier thread today with impressions about the Gox situation. I feel sorry for all the people who have lost money there. But going forward, it's a lesson that we need stronger exchanges. The Bitcoin community must demand a higher standard of quality and security from the institutions upon which we come to depend.

Moy does get it and I applaud him for that. But this is not some financial insider here; he is a political appointee who was rewarded with the Mint job after he helped Bush in Wisconsin. It probably didn't hurt that he was one of the few Asian Americans involved. Before that, he had a minor job in the Dept. of Health and Human Services and worked for Blue Cross--no financial background. The Director of the Mint is charged with a lot of very archaic responsibilities (engraving/design/coinage/making coins for collectors) and is buried in the Treasury Department. He was not exactly sitting in on cabinet meetings. My point: I'm sure he's a good guy and he does "get it" with respect to Bitcoin, but his ability to influence financial decision-makers is zilch.

I can't tell from the picture. They might be some of the newer Casascius "coins" which are not loaded with BTC value. Some of them can be loaded with value, though, if they have the hologram image thing on the back. If not, then they are promotional rounds which only have a sentimental value (in addition to any silver, copper, etc. they might contain). Other companies have printed some up as well. The really valuable Casascius coins were halted (he only made them 2011-2013) because the owner received a nasty letter from the Treasury Department. People still re-sell those on eBay and elsewhere, though; they are real collector's items.

Dear Senator Manchin,
I have always admired your bipartisan leadership. However, your recent open letter in opposition to Bitcoin struck me as extremely uninformed and full of mistaken assumptions. Bitcoin and other digital currencies can help millions of Americans make payments without being beholden to high credit card fees. It is actually less anonymous than using cash for transactions; cash will always be an easier way to launder money. 
In addition, Silicon Valley venture capitalists, who I believe have helped fund some of your past campaigns, are pouring money into developing companies and applications which provide a trustworthy infrastructure for digital payment systems built around Bitcoin. There is more Silicon Valley investment Bitcoin companies right now than almost any other segment of technology. By opposing this innovation, you are mistakenly going to cost jobs and tax revenue for millions of law abiding Americans in West Virginia and other states. State regulators in NY and throughout the country are hard at work developing common sense regulations to prevent money-laundering through digital currencies, so this will not be an issue when the new regulations come out. Please reconsider your ill-advised stance and announce that you (like Senator Tom Carper of Delaware) are eager to see what innovations Bitcoin can bring. It can be a force for good in the world. --Sincerely, _____

Actually, if you read his comments, they were quite reasonable. And not negative towards Bitcoin.

She's right. The Fed is a central bank, not a regulatory authority. The Treasury Department, theoretically, has this regulation power, but only if the laws so provide.

Stay clear of Ripple and give it a wide margin. If you want to buy a few thousand XRP and keep it in a wallet just in case it pops, go ahead, but basically it is a very strange duck with many facets. I just don't see how they're going to make it work on all those levels. Many of the Bitcoin and other altcoin supporters are fiercely libertarian and into decentralization, so Ripple just isn't getting any traction with this crowd.

Bitcoin is not perfect, but it has a pretty good headstart. I think it is here to stay until someone finds a real flaw or it just becomes too rare and expensive. 
I am very weary of all the altcoins, but some of them really do have important niches. Mining bitcoin, for example, has become the province of those who can afford rich mining rigs. Then Litecoin brought in scrypt, allowing people to mine on their own. The Doge thing was comical, but it worked pretty well for awhile. Now ASICs have figured out scrypt and mining pools are rigging things, so people are mining ASIC-resistant currencies like Vertcoin with their CPUs and GPUs. Then they can trade these for Bitcoin, enabling them to acquire Bitcoin via mining. I have been down-voting most new currency announcements, but I also really liked the one for the Iceland-focused coin (the name escapes me). The idea of a local/regional currency fills a great niche also.

How about we choose a senior poster who is trusted and whose identity is known (not suggesting myself), then start a Wikipedia donation site. We show them how much we've raised, tell them they can have it if they incorporate Bitcoin into their site, and then if they don't, we agree that it will be given to some universally-respected charity?
@_date: 2014-05-30 21:40:57
Yes, without question they are all working on it. Banks, too. We've seen pieces of news on this for months involving many of these companies: patent applications, e-mails, leaks, and occasionally some executive mentioning it in an interview. They need to be ready to join the party if/when others jump on board. But all of these companies work on plenty of things that never get implemented, some of which are contingency plans. There is no guarantee they will move in this direction to accept Bitcoin, though I think they will eventually. My point was that accepting Bitcoin doesn't necessarily mean they have to buy one of the large payment processors. 
@_date: 2014-01-25 07:07:41
Don't worry; I think Google knows the deal with Doge. Those posters are getting to be like the people who call radio stations and say that they worship the prostate of Howard Stern --it's fun for awhile, but starting to seem like amateur hour. I also wish we could coalesce around one good currency (Bitcoin or maybe NXT). But I think the positive with Doge is that it's brought a lot of new people into cryptocoins. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:26:44

It will happen, maybe in six months or maybe six hours. This is when fortunes are made; don't be stuck on the outside.

From reading the article, it actually sounds like they might impose FEWER restrictions than they'd originally planned.

The BitInstant guy was intentionally laundering criminals' money. If you read the excerpts of his emails that are in the criminal charges, you will see that his activity was blatantly intentional, and he knew very well he was dealing with illegal money.

They could make almost as much with BTC by eliminating chargebacks and the fees they pay to Visa, etc., while profiting from a large volume of BTC transactions. If PP integrated bitcoin NOW, it could immediately become the go-to payment system for dollars and bitcoins. And eBay could make a mint off currency sales. If they're smart, they will jump on this right away. Each day they wait, Coinbase, Bitpay, or some startup with venture capital funding is that much closer to a competitive payment platform.

On the contrary, I have never interacted with a group of developers that is as accessible and open to different ideas as the Invictus folks behind Bitshares. At some point, yes, they have to make a decision without having 6,000 people vote on it, but once the main line of DACs is out, then developers will be able to create their own businesses and tweak the model as they see fit.

He got a lot of things right. Bitcoin is a marvelous innovation. But S. didn't have the opportunity to test it out.

Dear Senator Manchin,
I have always admired your bipartisan leadership. However, your recent open letter in opposition to Bitcoin struck me as extremely uninformed and full of mistaken assumptions. Bitcoin and other digital currencies can help millions of Americans make payments without being beholden to high credit card fees. It is actually less anonymous than using cash for transactions; cash will always be an easier way to launder money. 
In addition, Silicon Valley venture capitalists, who I believe have helped fund some of your past campaigns, are pouring money into developing companies and applications which provide a trustworthy infrastructure for digital payment systems built around Bitcoin. There is more Silicon Valley investment Bitcoin companies right now than almost any other segment of technology. By opposing this innovation, you are mistakenly going to cost jobs and tax revenue for millions of law abiding Americans in West Virginia and other states. State regulators in NY and throughout the country are hard at work developing common sense regulations to prevent money-laundering through digital currencies, so this will not be an issue when the new regulations come out. Please reconsider your ill-advised stance and announce that you (like Senator Tom Carper of Delaware) are eager to see what innovations Bitcoin can bring. It can be a force for good in the world. --Sincerely, _____

I'm betting on Bitcoin, but I'd never bet everything on our current systems of energy and infrastructure.

I think what we're going to see is something comprehensive like NXT or Ethereum eventually succeed over the next couple of years. There will be a decentralized peer-to-peer trading platform that doesn't charge fees at all or very little. A real Napster of monetary systems. And at that point, we won't need the more expensive exchanges, though they may still serve purposes in certain countries and niches. Sadly, some restrictive governments will still be able to ban it all, but their grip will be tenuous. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 17:59:55

@_date: 2014-02-03 06:21:54
NXT's decentralized exchange should debut soon, probably much sooner than Ethereum's. I know they don't see one another as competitors, but they probably are. The NXT platform (and, potentially, Ethereum's) will create more uses for Bitcoin. NXT's exchange will make it much easier for people to buy and sell these currencies without high trading fees from sketchy exchanges. So I think this could add to Bitcoin's value while also providing great value to NXT. If Ethereum can solve its security issues and design an IPO that isn't universally condemned by 80% of the cryptocoin community, then maybe they won't be as hated as they seem to be now. The Ethereum idea is nice, but they will need better execution. The fact that they just hired a PR person to sell it might help.

We need to appeal to a wider audience if Bitcoin is going to achieve mainstream acceptance.

In fact, it just asks for your e-mail (use any), and there is no payment needed. The Paypal thing is just a donation requested for their free site, but no donation needed to sign. Let's get a few more of these and turn them in. Thanks!

Either that or get Manning or Wilson (one of whom will win) to say that they are going to celebrate by buying a sheet set on Overstock and pay for it in bitcoin!

Excellent! Unfortunately in the U.S., especially given the Supreme Court's recent rulings on campaign finance, elections are bought and paid for by billionaires and large companies. It's a waste of money, but the only realistic chance is to "crowd fund" good candidates with a lot of smaller donations from a larger pool of people. Within weeks or months, I think most candidates this year will be forced to accept Bitcoin or ignore that pool of potential donations. Which means that...policy-wise, they will end up being a lot more supportive of Bitcoin than they otherwise might have been.

Fixing the price is not the solution. BitUSD will solve these problems. Check out what Bitshares is doing with Bitshares X. BitUSD Dollar equivalents, Bitcoins, and more will be freely tradeable for the first time in a decentralized manner.

Sample letter (feel free to customize)
Dear Senator Manchin,
I have always admired your bipartisan leadership. However, your recent open letter in opposition to Bitcoin struck me as extremely uninformed and full of mistaken assumptions. Bitcoin and other digital currencies can help millions of Americans make payments without being beholden to high credit card fees. It is actually less anonymous than using cash for transactions; cash will always be an easier way to launder money. 
In addition, Silicon Valley venture capitalists, who I believe have helped fund some of your past campaigns, are pouring money into developing companies and applications which provide a trustworthy infrastructure for digital payment systems built around Bitcoin. There is more Silicon Valley investment Bitcoin companies right now than almost any other segment of technology. By opposing this innovation, you are mistakenly going to cost jobs and tax revenue for millions of law abiding Americans in West Virginia and other states. State regulators in NY and throughout the country are hard at work developing common sense regulations to prevent money-laundering through digital currencies, so this will not be an issue when the new regulations come out. Please reconsider your ill-advised stance and announce that you (like Senator Tom Carper of Delaware) are eager to see what innovations Bitcoin can bring. It can be a force for good in the world. --Sincerely, _____

Your intent is good here, but your question doesn't quite hit the mark. It's not the number of developers (since there aren't that many) on Bitcoin itself. The impressive thing is the amount of activity in this ecosystem as a whole: the number of developers, amount of venture capital, and associated activity in the Bitcoin/cryptocurrency sphere.

It was a good article. Sorry if my comments were hurtful. I just read it one way the first time, through my own biases. As a writer, one of the best things you can learn is to face criticism and keep on going. You'll develop a thicker skin and fare well. 
What coins are you in? PM me and I'll send you a nice tip.

Not 'all you own'. There are still risks. But I'd say this is a big boost if it happens, and I'd feel comfortable buying a good sized quantity of Bitcoin. I'm still not quite sure what their plans are after seeing that interview with the CEO. 
It's here, by the way, if anyone hasn't seen the interview (link below). I believe it's at about 3:00 when Matt Miller asks him the question. His answer to the next follow-up question is the most telling. That dumb co-host chick utterly ruined their newsmaker interview, though, by cutting him off with a less significant question.

Yes, and we should all support this. Micropayments will be great for bitcoin, and this is one big way bitcoin can help the world. Please go on the Chicago Sun-Times website TODAY, click on something, and donate 25 cents when the pop-up comes up.

I look forward to watching it. Quick question, though. Are "Bitshares Bingo" and these other planned DACs going to be part of the Bitshares DAC? In other words, I know that holding PTS confers the right to profit from future DACs. Since these DACs have Bitshares in their names, are they also under the Bitshares DAC or are they separate DACs that are under the Bitshares "corporate" umbrella but not included within the Bitshares X DAC? Thanks!

A crypto for a local currency; that's awesome! They may need to print up some IOUs or something, though. I'll bet that PC and even smartphone penetration rates are lacking in some of those communities. Good luck to them!

When it goes down to $0 on Gox, then we can be rid of them. Is there any way to cut them out of the blockchain? If not, we need to sit tight while they die a slow and agonizing death.

Bitcoin also enables micro-payments, such as to newspapers (for reading an article) or to charities. A charity cannot normally receive a one cent or fifty cent donation, because the transaction fees are too high. But with Bitcoin, small amounts are possible and these add up. 
Since your interviewer is a journalist, mention that bitcoin could save journalism. The Chicago Sun Times experimented on February 1 with using a Bitcoin bitwall, where users made donations. They received a lot of donations for a charity, most of them 25 cents each. It worked! On a daily basis, newspapers could create a new for-profit model this way where people pay small amounts for articles they want to read.

True, but credit card companies are willing to extend credit for that period of time until things are confirmed. With Bitcoin, we don't have that luxury.

Mass media does not have any special knowledge and I often don't care for their spin on things. But in this case, I hope they are right; if Mt. Gox dies a quick death, it will spare the bitcoin community more prolonged agony.

Wow, that was some GREAT air time for Bitcoin on a go-to network that a lot of financial people watch. The basic takeaway was that it's full of promise, not just as an investment, but for lowering transaction fees and using colored coins, etc. Excellent exposure.
