You didn't link sources for anything of what you just said. You just said that the rbitcoin side is more valid 'because I said so' than the rbtc side.
Note, I have like 50% of my crypto investments in bitcoin, and like 15% in bitcoin cash. I'm not on either side, I just try to read both sides.
A quick google search shows your first point is completely false. I found 4 development groups within 30 seconds of googling:
* Bitcoin Unlimited, 358 contributors, 77 people onsite, actively developped
* Bitcoin Classic (couldn't find anything specifically about amount of people)
* Bitcoin XT, 329 contributors, 73 people on site, actively developped
* Bitcoin ABC, 426 contributors, 93 people on site, actively developped
For your second point, could you link some sources? Maybe he did pay people to do marketing for bitcoin cash, I haven't read sources about it though, and I frequest rbitcoin quite often.

Because exactly of your current perspective. You assume rbtc are sockpuppets for a scam artist. Whereas people on rbtc think people on rbitcoin are sockpuppets of a development group which keeps bitcoin unusable on purpose to force people onto the lightning network which will be centralized and ran by banks.
You are the exact reason to subscribe to both subreddits, to avoid becoming like you.
Maybe there's some middle ground? Maybe a bit of both sides is true? Open your horizons man.

I'm just worried that the lightning network is basically just going to be next banking system... I no longer control my own bitcoin, I have to stash them at a third party, ahead of time, before I can even use them.
And by the way, I still get the long confirmations and high fees to transfer it to a hub in the first place.
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:48:06
That's obviously true, but this "civil war" is absolutely not black and white.

You think it's very elegant that for the past months bitcoin was practically unusable? Yeah yeah, you'll find the one purchase made in the last week where someone paid 4 cents and was confirmed in the nest block, but in reality this doesn't happen. There's a reason something like steam abandoned bitcoin.
I hope the lightning network will work, but I'm skeptical. I have to decide beforehand how much I want to deposit, which just feels really bad. I also don't want 20 different ones to deposit in, one for starbucks, one for my local grocery shop, one for my gym, one for netflix, one for spotify, etc...

Most of the time bitcoin cash has more transactions per day than Bitcoin....

You still have to pay like a 100 USD to open a channel, and then to close a channel, at this pace. No one is going to do that for their 'beer and coffee' channel.

Interesting. I once fucked up a deposit, and forgot the reference code. I contacted support with my iban code and time of transaction, and then went to bed. Woke up next morning with an email saying they found the transaction and credited me. Looked at the timestamp and it was like 2 hours after I made my ticket. 
Their platform may be buggy/slow as hell, but their support was top tier to me. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:10:22
Alright, if you don't want to show any proof or argument because it's not worth your time, that's fine! I have google searched though and found nothing conclusive :( And I definitely found conclusive evidence that bitcoin cash has many developers where you said they didn't.

Fair enough, I didn't know they weren't invited.
What would you consider a good way to upgrade the protcol through a hard fork? It's impossible to get everyone who uses bitcoin together, let alone satisfy everyone. How do we signal consent for a proposed change?
@_date: 2017-11-10 08:10:28
This is some crazy conspiracy theory. If you look at the technology and actual demand for transactions, what you're saying makes no sense. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:02:07
So Bitcoin will never get upgraded? Because hard forks are needed to be able to upgrade. 
Right now, Bitcoin is useless as a currency, and it's only useful as a store of value. I can't use it to buy anything unless it's a lot of money, because paying 5-10 euros per transaction is insane if you're buying something worth 50 bucks. 
Bitcoin NEEDS to be upgraded. Whether this is through block size increase of side chains or some other way, it needs to be upgraded. According to your statement, this can never happen. (Because it's an attack and only the old chain is Bitcoin)

Let me prefase this by saying: I am not in favor nor against s2x. Infact, I personally don't even really care. I don't "believe" in bitcoin from an idealistic standpoint, though I definitely see uses for cryptocurrencies.
However, as far as I have understood it, s2x is simply an upgrade to the protocol, that was agreed upon quite a while ago by a lot of big players in Bitcoin.
What makes it an attack? Just because core changed its mind, it's suddenly an attack? I am trying to understand what makes a consentual agreement, that upgrades the protcol, an attack?
Will bitcoin never have a hardfork to upgrade the protocol, because it causes core to lose its business model? (Making money off sidechains)
I am generally curious, because I've looked but I basically nowhere read any arguments against the proposed upgraded protcol to s2x? What's the benefit of not upgrading? The only thing s2x does is increase transaction capacity, and thus not need ridiculous transaction fees. I am sorry if this comes accross as offensive, but I am trying to understand the reasons for boycotting a planned upgrade.
Ethereum has done it multiple times already, with absolutely no issues, why can't bitcoin just continue forward instead of stagnating? Bitcoin right now is a completely unusable currency for anything not worth thousands of euros/dollars. I transfered out of my kraken to my wallet and later back to kraken and I've lost like 30 bucks on transaction fees, it's insane. Litecoin on the otherhand was practically free, same for bitcoin cash.
So: Why can't bitcoin be upgraded like originally planned? Why is it considered an 'attack', to actually go forward with the planned upgrade from the NYA agreement? Why do people who actually try to USE bitcoin be punished? I don't want to lose 5-10 bucks on every transaction. Make bitcoin usable again.
Again, I am actually trying to understand. I am not very invested financially, nor timewise into cryptocurrencies (just a couple of thousand euros, and I read blogs and reddit a bit, but I don't fully understand every part about it nor do I read the github code and stuff). If the s2x fork is an 'attack', what proposed hardfork would NOT be an attack?

Ah right my bad. Yeah as you said, shorts affect the price. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:02:34
You're shorting a derivative of Bitcoin though, not Bitcoin. It may impact the price in psychological ways due to news headlines and stuff, but it doesn't directly contribute to supply/demand of btc itself. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:46:34
You can though...

I didn't even realize there was a "dip" until I visited this sub. The current "dip" is just normal fluctuation to me. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:22:48
All I want is bigger blocks. Right now Exodus wallet is giving me 8 euro transaction fees...meanwhile Bitcoin cash is giving me 8 cents.

The strategy to make the most amount of money is to not gamble at all when the odds are not in your favour.

Did you not read the comments in that thread? Everyone was bashing him.
