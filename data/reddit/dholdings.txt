The address to which your coins were moved is seemingly a Binance deposit address, seeing as they were then moved to one of Binance's main hot wallets ([1NDyJtNTjmwk5xPNhjgAMu4HDHigtobu1s](

[btcmarkets]( is great, branch deposits cleared within an hour and it's an actual exchange. Has buy/sell orderbook for both BTC and LTC with nice volume. Signed up and was verified and trading within a few hours.

When you have BTC in your circle wallet you will have the option to withdraw funds. This is effectively selling to circle, as you can choose to deposit USD to either your linked credit card or bank account from your BTC balance.

Been using mxcnow.com for months and it has my vote for the best non-fiat exchange. The interest thing is legit, my understanding is it's calculated based upon the trading fees and "payban" revenue.
Paybans are for the chat/trollbox, you can effectively mute others in chat by paying BTC. The time of the mute varies according to the amount of BTC paid, 0.01 BTC = 4 minute mute. 
So rather than the exchange operator taking 100% of the revenue it is shared among the users as interest.

So glad I don't have to go through waiting weeks for withdrawals using certain exchanges. Their buy prices were pretty much on par with the markets and the whole process was very easy. Any fellow Australians should definitely give them a look.
