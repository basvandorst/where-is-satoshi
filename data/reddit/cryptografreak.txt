If you have a credit card you can buy bitcoin from this exchange  , but first you'd have to buy Linden Dollars and then convert them to bitcoin

After signing up share your referral link which you should find in the dashboard of bonafide.io on facebook and twitter. You'd also have to sign-up for a coinbase.com account, the free bitcoins would be sent to your wallet on coinbase.com
