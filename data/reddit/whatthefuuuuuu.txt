Five thousand? That is a lot for a bitcoin company actually. We have only give out fractions of a bitcoin in our bug bounty program.
@_date: 2015-12-11 19:50:04
This is partly true. We also fucked up by blowing too much money on stupid shit. That didn't leave us with enough funding to keep all of our staff. Our management didn't take advantage of business opportunities either. Many mistakes were made that actually were our fault.
@_date: 2015-12-12 17:05:35
Nice this is actually useful.
@_date: 2016-01-21 17:28:44
Yes this is old news. We released this a while back.
@_date: 2016-01-21 17:39:24
You are asking the right question. Tony went over the numbers with us during an all hands meeting. Most of our merchants don't do any business. They sign up and never do anything. A small percentage like around 5% process bitcoin payments regularly. Maybe I can find the slides if you want an accurate number.
@_date: 2015-09-03 02:46:54
I work there
@_date: 2015-09-25 15:42:39
If you think reading that is sad imagine how sad things were yesterday watching a large amount of your coworkers leaving.
@_date: 2015-09-03 15:14:26
Youre right it is very sad. We all hate it since we've poured so much of our fucking time into this place. None of the employees want to see it go down but I'm so fucking tired of the slow train wreck and nobody saying anything truthful about it.
@_date: 2015-09-24 20:33:40
Ironic isnt it?
@_date: 2015-09-25 22:06:28
We are smaller now and our time is split between new projects and keeping the current system running. It remains to be seen but I can't see how development won't slow down on some things. Its really too early to tell.
@_date: 2015-09-03 12:18:13
Because that is what we do. Scramble from hot project to hot project, partially implement it, show it to some banks and then abandon it.
@_date: 2015-09-25 15:03:46
@_date: 2015-09-03 13:07:20
Most of us that don't have our heads up our asses agree with you. That's what makes this situation unfortunate.
@_date: 2015-09-25 14:53:24
Yes it is pretty accurate. Whole teams were fired yesterday. We really scaled back hardcore. I don't see how we can function in the same capacity now honestly.
@_date: 2015-09-24 20:05:59
You can run your own BWS server.
@_date: 2015-09-03 15:16:33
We don't
@_date: 2015-09-25 15:47:04
I wish we had taken this route at Bitpay but Stephen doesn't believe in patents even for defensive reaons. I did hear that some other people in leadership talking about it at one point tho.
@_date: 2015-09-26 19:52:23
Are you getting an error?
@_date: 2015-09-03 01:08:24
Using a throwaway here.
You wouldn't believe it even if you saw it for yourself. Bitpay is in chaos internally due to layoffs, a mass exit of developers leaving, and a lack of leadership. What more is there to say? They are spiraling downward whilst the founders bicker behind each other's backs.
@_date: 2015-09-24 16:46:58
Yes but since our marketing staff was included in the layoffs I doubt you'll see much of a media response
@_date: 2015-09-25 15:14:40
Don't fret. We kept our marketing intern to run the department for us.
@_date: 2015-09-25 15:57:24
@_date: 2015-09-25 20:54:49
The overwhelming majority of development is us. One or two of our projects have a few outside contributions but nothing significant in comparison to the amount of code we write.
@_date: 2015-09-26 02:06:45
Why do you think that? We don't have anything of value to bring to the table. No IP. No cash cows. Nothing but a handful of open source projects and a list of merchants who barely use our service. I wish we would get bought so my stock options would be worth something tho.
@_date: 2015-09-26 19:39:20
I have given a lot of proof. We don't have name badges.
@_date: 2015-09-24 16:07:05
That is not true Rob. We have made breaking changes to our api that have had nothing to do with security.
@_date: 2015-09-03 12:14:13
Since I still work there and don't want to get fired I can't give you much proof I'm afraid. It's a small company and they monitor Reddit closely.
We peaked at around 75-80 people between Atlanta, Amsterdam and Argentina but when Stephen and Tony started going for another round of funding our numbers looked horrible. The rate of merchant adoption did not scale with the rate they grew the staff and so they did the first round of layoffs. Eric Martindale was one of those laid off along with our VP of Marketing and a few others from each department. They also instituted a travel ban and some other attempts at cost saving.
@_date: 2015-09-25 15:03:35
@_date: 2015-09-03 13:49:11
Yes ok thats true. The new features we are rolling out aren't enough to turn things around tho.
@_date: 2015-09-24 15:59:13
And we laid off most of our remaining staff today.
@_date: 2015-09-26 19:45:27
I doubt those guys would have done that. It makes more sense to me that our infrastructure needs to be constantly watched.
@_date: 2015-09-03 13:24:27
What do you mean?
@_date: 2015-09-29 22:40:25
Just because something is honest doesn't make it negative.  If we can't look at problems seriously we will never learn from them.  Welcome criticism don't be scared of it.
@_date: 2015-09-03 13:19:00
I'm guessing they won't react. They don't need to. Coinbase beat us fair and square because they realized the chicken and egg problem early on. If people don't have bitcoin they can't spend it. By going after the consumer they beat us. We are just now about to roll out some new features to address this issue but it's too late. The leadership burned through too much capital too quickly and if we don't get more money soon we won't be around much longer. Our burn rate to income is atrocious. Seriously you wouldn't believe it. Some measures have helped like we have the entire 2nd floor of our building on Piedmont in Buckhead (we blew way too much fucking money on office space in "Buckhead") but rented out one side of it to Salesloft. We're crammed in the other side. Crammed may not be the right word but it's getting better as people leave and space opens up.
@_date: 2015-09-24 16:56:50
You'll see.
@_date: 2015-09-26 14:55:56
Yes check my history.
@_date: 2015-09-03 12:23:00
I know and I agree. But if you knew how badly we want to tell the truth about this place but can't you'd understand the anonymity.
@_date: 2015-09-26 01:56:54
Agreed. We are very much reactive instead of proactive. Many times we have no idea an update will break something in production until it is deployed. Either an internal or external customer discovers a problem and complains about it. Then he acts all upset that something is broken and yells at someone `you should have known that would break X`. One of my coworkers said it best. He said Stephen doesn't understand that culture starts from the top. Throw in to the mix that most of us have never worked in a real software development shop or only have a few years experience. So yeah things will break. Shit will be fucked up. Help us plan these things out and set the standard if you don't like us writing shit on the fly. We are a start up but we don't have to do things half ass.
@_date: 2015-09-25 14:37:35
It is. Except that doesn't describe Bitpay. We are inefficient and unfocused. The smartest business people in our company are told by Tony and Stephen to STFU when they propose good ideas.
@_date: 2015-09-25 14:45:24
This is something one of our developers on another team proposed to bring back. Tony shot it down.
@_date: 2015-09-25 15:51:19
Yes I agree with your logic. A small and lean consumer payment processor might be profitable if they can get enough merchants signed up. But overall there is not enough business to support a medium to large sized bitcoin company on that model.
@_date: 2015-09-26 15:06:37
We are working on it. Our devops team was one of the teams laid off so we are trying to figure this out ourselves.
@_date: 2015-09-24 19:33:02
This. The morons with no business sense are still here.
@_date: 2015-09-24 21:00:54
I'm not going to take pictures of coworkers leaving with boxes in their arms in tears. Call the office and ask Sara the receptionist. You could also just come by the office if you are in Atlanta. Look at how few members are on our github page now compared to yesterday. Look at some linkedin pages. Some are already updated. Email them using their first name  and watch it bounce back.
@_date: 2015-09-25 03:38:00
There is not a reason to say it's not safe right now. We did keep some developers to ensure payment processing continues to function. Just don't expect much in the way of support since almost all support staff were let go.
@_date: 2015-09-24 16:41:13
It just fucking happened today dumbass.
@_date: 2015-09-25 17:43:43
I agree with you and let me clarify. I didn't say anyone was "dumb" and the term "phishing attack" is correct.  It might have been a very sophisticated phishing attack but at the end of the day that's exactly what it was. Perhaps the timing was just ideal for the attackers. Maybe our CFO had requested fund transfers in similar amounts earlier. Regardless of the reasons the circumstances created a perfect storm where Stephen transferred 5000 bitcoins to the attacker and nobody asked any questions until it was too late.
@_date: 2015-09-25 14:35:50
No Bryan, Stephen and Tony fell for a phisihing attack.
@_date: 2015-09-03 15:24:52
This is a perfect fucking example. Copay was a "hey cool let's make a wallet because we're smarter than everyone else" project just like everything we've done. Reinvent the wheel but make it less user friendly and incompatible with the existing standards everyone else fucking uses. There wasn't a thought before hand about how to actually make money with it since we are a business after all. Now that we're bleeding to death there is a fucking emergency scramble to make money with it somehow. Our upcoming features are attempts to do so but it is just too late.
@_date: 2015-09-03 12:21:33
He works "part time" for us now.
@_date: 2015-09-03 14:04:03
You are right about Manuel. His team is one of the best development teams we have. Nobody's going to buy us even tho we all wish it were true so our stock options might be worth something. Why would they when you can download all our shit from github conveniently licensed and everything?
@_date: 2015-09-25 14:41:43
Maybe. The jury is still out. Don't discount the human cost of this tho. We gave a lot of people a kick in the nuts right before the holiday season. People with new families. People that believed the bullshit Stephen and Tony spouted every Monday. Friends of mine.
@_date: 2015-09-26 15:47:16
There were only two of them but yes the whole team.
@_date: 2015-09-25 15:39:57
Yes we pay our interns pretty nicely. Although to be honest he might have been hired as an employee at some point. Regardless he is a one man show now. Reports to Tony.
@_date: 2015-09-25 15:48:21
We are working on it. Things are a bit rough right now. Have some patience while it is sorted out please.
@_date: 2015-09-26 14:49:00
Free software doesn't pay the salary of the developer who wrote it.
@_date: 2015-09-25 15:35:52
You are 100% correct.
@_date: 2015-09-25 22:13:44
That would require planning and foresight. So no.
@_date: 2015-09-25 15:13:23
Just take a look at who is left on Slack. I thought they would spare Sara but even our receptionist wasn't safe from the cuts.
@_date: 2015-09-03 03:05:01
It really could be a great company because there's so much going for it. Nobody wants it to be successful more than the employees who pour themselves into it. Every day there feels like the success is being squandered on moronic projects that waste resources and time.
@_date: 2015-09-25 15:56:37
Look you can't really compare us with Coinbase any more. The way our two companies conducts business and our different focus put us both in different categories. We focus on merchants and other business. Coinbase focuses on consumers. Our transactions are all on chain. Coinbase uses off chain transactions. We make things easy or try to at least for business. Coinbase makes things easy for the end user.
@_date: 2015-09-26 02:11:06
Sure it will. I've got a very profitable company to sell you then.
@_date: 2015-09-25 03:15:07
Thank you
@_date: 2015-09-24 20:05:06
Good luck getting our support team to be responsive now. Most of them were laid off today including the manager of that department. Those of us left don't want to deal with support tickets directly.
@_date: 2015-09-03 12:30:25
Our CEO stood in front of all the staff during one of our Monday morning "all hands" meetings and told us he didn't care about profits. He said that we should pursue the users and projects first then figure out how to monetize them later. Fast forward to a few months later and they realized how much they fucked up by giving away payment processing. A new payment plan is coming that will do away with the free bullshit. Everyone will start off at 1% and work up from there.

Here is the complete text of the email Stephen sent out yesterday.
    From: Stephen Pair &lt;stephen
    Date: Thu, Sep 24, 2015 at 9:58 AM
    Subject: Important Company Announcement
    To: "everyone &lt;everyone
    
    
    I have some very difficult news to deliver to everyone today.  We must reduce the size of our workforce in order
    to reduce our costs and better align ourselves with the pace of growth in our industry.  This will be an emotional
    day for everyone, but especially for those that will separate from the company.  I urge everyone to be
    professional and considerate and not allow the emotion of the day to get the better of you.  It saddens me to
    have to deliver this news as it has been an honor to get to know each and every one of you and my privilege to
    work with you.  And I know Tony feels the same way.
    
    We will be communicating with those that are separating as quickly as possible.  They will head home after they
    are notified and will have our full support with job search and references.   For those with positions not
    eliminated, we will have a meeting to discuss the road ahead later today.

Yes of course it is. But you have to understand that logic and business sense don't usually factor into decisions that our leaders make. If it did we wouldn't be at the point where we are barely limping by now.

We don't have much of that $30 million left.

I didn't spam anything and I never said I was one of the employees laid off. Nobody is going to post using their real account. What kind of "proof" do you want? Pictures of the severance agreements they handed out? Pictures of people carrying their shit out? A copy of the email Stephen sent to the entire company this morning? Just fucking go down there and see for yourself. I know there are some people here on Reddit who live in Atlanta. Or you could just sit tight and see that I was right again.
@_date: 2015-11-07 03:58:06
"Humble" and "modest" are definitely not two words that describe Jeff Garzik. Have you actually worked with him? He hardly ever worked at BitPay when he was employed. Came in at 10 and left at 2 if he even came in at all. Hardly ever replied to people who emailed or messaged him unless you were holding the mining equipment he had shipped to the office. This dude is a major narcissistic douchebag. Stop putting guys like him on a pedestal and see them for who they really are. People skills matter.
@_date: 2015-10-01 16:08:56
He hasnt worked for us in a full time role for a long time. Last Thursday his position was cut completely.
