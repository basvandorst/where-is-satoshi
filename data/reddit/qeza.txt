Exactly. As far as the price vulnerability goes, the importance of China is comparable to importance of MtGox one year ago. The sooner they are not relevant the better.
@_date: 2014-04-17 20:37:05


What about this:
The two biggest Chinese exchanges announced on their official websites that one of their banking partner received a "notice of the higher authorities" that they can't provide services to the exchanges anymore.
Anyway, I'm not alarmed and not trying to alarm anyone. I just make a fun from FUDers. Because actually, OP is the one spreading FUD. Particularly, he is spreading FUD that everything is just a FUD.

I get that. But what I mean is that this can't apply when you trade at exchanges. Let's say I send $10 to Kraken and buy btc. Bitcoin goes up 50% then and I trade it for ltc, which later goes up another 50%. So now I have $22.5 woth of ltc and I send it to my BTC-E account, where I trade more and make $100 worth of ppc. Coincidentally a coffee shop on my street just started to accept ppc and they sell some fantastic cookies that I can't resist buying them for all my ppc.
So now, how I do the tax? If I was going to pay a tax from all the profitable jumps from a coin to another coin on my way to 1000% gain, sometimes jumping over 10 pairs a day, that would be simply stupid. If I open an account at brokerage firm that facilitate trades of futures contracts on commodities, and I buy a contract for corn for $100, sell it for $150 and then I buy wheat for $150 and get $200 out of it, I don't have to tax each profitable trade separately, that would have practically killed the trading.

Essentially, you admit that you know so little that you can't really know what has potential, how big it is, and why. But at the same time you think that you know that returns from bitcoin won't be as big as other people may think:




You're just missing that you convince yourself about something on ground of nothing.


BItcoin has the best chance to become mainstream (why? make research for yourself). This means that litecoin can bring higher returns but your risk is also higher. Even if litecoin also succeed, you will never know if it's going to yield more than bitcoin or not, unless you're gifted with abilities that don't exist.

I did not mean he settled with IGE. Debonneville sued Pierce for fraud and Pierce agreed to settle with the guy in order to lift the charges.


You're wrong on this, because Pierce was charged together with Collins-Rector and a third guy for rape, and they settled with plaintiff in order to have the charges withdrawn. If you knew smth about Collins-Rector, you could guess how likely the allegations are to be true.


Apart from the one I mentioned above, I heard of another two, and both also included well known and convinced sexual abuser Collins-Rector.
...and dirty tricks of KNC Miner are nothing new.
There is too much of dirt on Brock Pierce to think that all of it is just a coincidence. I don't know how naive a person must be to think so.
People that meet Pierce personally are saying how great that guy is. But he's a professional actor, it was his profession to play somebody else than he is. It's totally natural for him to be able to fool others.

In my opinion, you bought in the right moment. From technical perspective, there seems to be a strong support at $535 and the price is likely to stay above it. And even if it goes lower, don't panic, just hold, it shouldn't last long until the trend will change upward.

It's hard to predict anything but given the relatively shallow order books at bitcoin exchanges and the momentum that this market can easily gain, it's quite possible.

Do you know how big is the share of this usage out of the entire volume? I don't think you can estimate that at all. And since bank transactions leave traces, people that want to use bitcoin in this matter are likely looking for other ways of obtaining BTC. Such ways won't be affected by bitcoin bank ban.

I don't tell that Karpeles did not scam anybody for sure, but if I ask what benefits he would had from that, there seems to be no reasonable answer. He will be on radar till his death if he has big money, he can't enjoy them. However he could enjoy big money that would be made if MtGox continued operation normally.

If you consider it's worth to invest in bitcoin at all, you should split your risk capital into several small parts and start to buy every time it dives lower. That way you are likely to get better average price than the price you would get with the tactic you described.
Just look at how is the market doing today. Already went ~12% up before crashing back to the bottom. If the trend is going to change, it easily gain &gt;30% from the bottom before we could determine that it probably has changed. Look at the charts from the last summer, how promptly it has jumped from the bottom.

It wasn't only living in a house with a computer that contained child porn.
"Marc Collins-Rector, Chad Shackley and Brock Pierce were arrested in June on an international warrant after being indicted in New Jersey on five counts of transporting a minor across state lines for the purpose of engaging in sexual acts."
"Collins-Rector, Shackley and Pierce already face a $4.5m default judgement over offences with teenaged boys in the Beverly Hills and west Los Angeles area dating back to the early 1990s, after losing a civil court case brought by victims."
If you have read this: 
you would have found that Pierce and Rector were lovers and those thing with minors they likely did together.
Btw, Pierce was sued by his business partner for a scam and he lost: "During late 2006 and 2007, Debonneville was forced out of the company. Later Debonneville sued Pierce for various reasons related to an investment made by Goldman Sachs a year earlier, which Debonneville ended winning in a settlement."

I'm a bitcoin believer, but would advise you to be cautios, it can fail, and you don't want to find yourself without a penny when you get out.
My advise: take those $5000 and buy gold instead keeping the cash, there should be higher chances that the value will stay preserved. And to increase the chances for your crypto holdings, diversify it. Keep 10 btc and buy ether with the rest of it. Most people in this sub would dissaprove such move, but that's because they are biased against competition. I'm pretty sure that most of folks that aren't biased would tell you that ethereum currently has better risk/reward ratio.

This is not the right place to ask that question. This place is often visited by people indoctrinated in favour of BTC against altcoins. You can recognize them by displaying high level of self-certainty - that's how they hide their fear that they may be wrong.
Some altcoins are here to stay for the same reasons, why we don't have one operating system, use one browser, don't trade one stock index, or don't listen to the same music.

Since you invested in BTC, you agreed to undergo quite a risk of loss. I would suggest then to convert it in another high risk currency - Litecoin.

By your logic, if somebody occasionally uses LSD, which is "non-addictive, is not known to cause brain damage, and has extremely low toxicity relative to dose" (wikipedia citation), he is a drug addict. 
What about alcohol then? High-addictive, known to cause brain damage, and has very high toxicity relative to dose (actually its toxicity is right next to the cocaine and heroin). Do you consider occasionall drinkers addicts? There is apparently more reasons to do so than for an LSD user is. And what about the ethics of all alcohol producers and distributors?

Yes, it's too complex to be sure about something.
In my opinion, mass adoption of an altcoin doesn't kill innovation, although it doesn't bring much of competition. Since "crypto-space" is not a realm on its own, it doesn't need the competition within itself to evolve.
I see more danger to the innovation in power of technology and its economical and social benefits that it brings to those who back it. Ironically, once there might be a time when bitcoin will stand in the path of something innovative, if this can't be integrated into bitcoin protocol itself. But I'm not afraid that we'll see a lack of sources for trully innovation just because they are invested in Bitcoin's clones development.

Why do you see LTC as a new concept? You practically told that it's a clone of BTC. Since it's a clone, it's adding almost no more complexity to the underlying mechanisms, and doesn't raise requirements for knowledge of general public.
I'm not advocating LTC, I don't hold any (for now), but since diversity is in human and psychological nature, I see natural that there will be diversity in crypto-currencies. Traders and financial institutions are going to want it to diversify their assets in crypto-economy and to have more trading opportunities. At least a minority of merchants and organizations are going to want it for whatever reasons they find.
Maybe it won't be Litecoin, but for now it has the best position to be secondary to Bitcoin.
Like it or not, that's what is happening.
