Yeah of course. But in several places in their app they state very clearly that they do not profit from the network fee.

They DO profit from withdrawal fees.

I’ve been going down the same rabbit hole you did. They’ve been telling me I can use the mnemonic 12 word to get my private key but I’m pretty sure they’re lying at this point. All the associated addresses are empty as far as I can tell. 
But I came to a different conclusion. I’ll definitely not be using them again because of the lack of transparency. GDAX is a far superior solution IMO. Free fiat deposit, free limit order, free withdrawal to wallet of my choice. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 11:38:52
Yeah. No problem with fees as long as companies are up front about them. Abra claims not to profit from withdrawal fees.

Long term though, no one would continue to use btc if fees were forever that high. So btc value would drop, and the miners wouldn’t earn any fees because no one would use it.

Yeah I’m no communist. Love profit! But don’t lie about it. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:41:26
Actually I literally just received my deposit haha. About 3 hours too late. 
George Soros must have something to do with this ��

GDAX.  GDAX.  GDAX. 
1. Initiate bank transfer of X dollars \(free\)
2. Purchase BTC using limit order \(free\)
3. Transfer to wallet where you control key \(free from GDAX\)
$0.000 in fees for the entire process

Thanks. 
Why would people spam the blockchain? To try to attack it or slow it down? 
The part about blockchain size is a good point. Increases centralization to have ginormous blockchain. 
How does LN work now vs how will it be improved in the future? Right now it seems incredibly cumbersome. 
What’s the vision for bitcoin? Am I supposed to be able to use it day to day as cash to buy every day goods and services? Would everyone have to run their own LN node for this to happen? 
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:29:11
Crazy! Haha
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:02:05
Yeah I could see not wanting to pay taxes on your 10,000% bitcoin gains just to get a questionable coin. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 01:19:33
Thanks for your friendly input
@_date: 2018-04-10 01:25:48
Fair enough. I do plenty of reading but sometimes it helps to have things explained. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:22:00
I mean I guess if you bought 100 bitcoins in 2011 for $100, you’re probably perfectly happy just holding your stack haha. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 21:44:48
Why do you assume this is anything but a short blip on the road to $4000? 
@_date: 2018-04-10 01:08:45
I don’t. I remember seeing that it hit Coinbase, but I didn’t own any at the time. Couldn’t try sending any. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 02:40:35
That was a great read
@_date: 2018-04-25 02:38:16
No, and I’m not calling bitcoin a collectible. But my point was that millionaires are not just going to buy entire bitcoins just for the sake of owning entire bitcoins.

The beauty of photography is that once you produce an image of something, you will always have it unless you lose or destroy it.

@_date: 2018-04-10 01:38:44
Great. Thanks for your time and answers. 
I wonder: will most people be transacting on the LN? Seems like maybe that’s the case. How do you verify the validity of txs on LN, if they aren’t on a public ledger? 
I need to do more reading on LN haha. 
Also I think the mods removed this post because it was discussing an alt-coin. I’m a little peeved about that. Just trying to have a discussion. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:19:05
Great point. Also I’m curious about exchange dust. I bet it adds up to more than people think. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:12:59
One thing to consider: if you were hodling last fall, why wouldn’t you have moved your BTC around at all? Bcash fork and segwit implementation should have motivated just about everyone to at least move it to a different wallet, right? And if you’ve been hodling since 2014 or even 2013 or earlier, you’d be crazy not to sell at $10k+. 
We’re talking $20+ billion dollars that hasn’t moved in over 3 years. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 00:13:43
What about dentacoin? Ha
@_date: 2018-04-18 02:43:40
So we’re talking 15-20% of bitcoin hasn’t been transacted with in at least 3 years? And this percentage is growing. 
That’s a lot of lost bitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 01:56:53
Good stuff. Thanks
@_date: 2018-04-24 20:44:08
Millionaires don't become millionaires by impulsively buying collectibles. They are not going to just buy a bitcoin for the sake of owning a bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:51:28
You’re about 2 hours late for those haha

Dang it! My gdax deposit clears tomorrow! Now I'm going to wait to buy until it cools down a bit.
