here's the Economist's take on the 2014 BNP Paribas fine:

you think a straight buy is best? do you see any value left in mining via ASICs or whatever the next big thing is?
I know this is expanding the OP, but what about the alternate currencies? Do you see potential in those, or is it best to stick with the king? 
edit: and this came up below. I don't think a buy and hold has any positive externalities - all it does is drive down the available stock of bitcoin. are there ways to mitigate this arguably negative effect?

i'll bite on that idea. do you think the buy &gt; mine advantage, if it is true, is going to hold up going forward? 
One of the things I've read about the buy and hold is that it really doesn't add anything to the bitcoin economy, so I like the idea of investing in the ecology of the thing. But there's no secondary market that I know of that trades in bitcoin company securities - how do I invest on a small scale (read: $100 - $3000) into those types of companies?

I think this is an interesting idea. Why weight it by market cap - to hedge against volatility? 
Backing up a bit, do you think the other currencies really stand a chance? my view has always been that it's a snowball type effect - you get vendors and common people buying into one functional currency and it sort of just rolls over all the other currencies by inertia, whether those other currencies are technically superior or not.

Thanks for this. We are not worried about risk. Our appetite for it is high, and we accept there's not much certainty in this emerging market. We also accept that a lot of the current price of BTC and other altcoins is pure speculation - that's why our window is longer. We believe there's value to be made. 
Just trying to get a general sense here in case you already know: Can you speak to the recent developments in the regulatory climate? I understand the NY State money guy Lawsky or whatever his name has been looking at it. Is there anyone else? Can you point me to any bulletins or decisions of regulatory authorities, US or otherwise?

I definitely appreciate your first-mover and network effect comments, and agree that if we're going in, bitcoin is likely the way. 
Can you elaborate on what you see as specific types of regulatory risks to the currency? Do you think one or two major markets (read: nations) adopting anti-bitcoin legislation is enough to negate its practical value as an investment, or will the market just move to somewhere less legitimate? I think I read that the US at least seems to be deferring to the states to see how they handle it.

this is interesting, thanks. can you tl;dr some advantages of these 2.0 currencies? do you think they're advanced enough to overcome what calls the first-mover and network effects attaching to bitcoins now?

what do you mean designed? designed by the makers of the ASICs? or is demand so high that prices on capable hardware have been pushed to the brink? 
can you quantify what "a ton of capital" is? what's the entry point?

You can take out a mortgage on it and spend $3 or $4m.

They could have at least made a crack about how the data we have on murder-for-hire schemes shows them to be nowhere near the reliability or quality of, say, your average cocaine vendor.

if btc input &gt;= expected btc output, buy and hold, else mine
