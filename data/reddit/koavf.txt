Whenever I see the word "anonymous" associated with a cryptocurrency, I cringe. It's the *least* anonymous record that you have, since there is literally visibility worldwide by definition. If you want anonymity, pay in cash.

And what makes you think that someone employing "logic" wouldn't be lead down a path like, say, "Well, *logically*, humans cause all crime, so the only way to have no crime is to kill all humans"? I understand the value of dispassionate reasoning but it seems like you *over*value it and also ignore the plain fact that politics is by definition who gets what and when (and how), which is by its very nature an expression of *values*. There is no such thing as dispassionate politics because you need to make decisions about what *should* be done, not merely a causal change of something that *could* be done with somehow magically assuming first principles.
The cure for cruelty in this scenario is not less compassion but more because it's perfectly appropriate and possible (if difficult) to love your enemy.

Yeah, I got blocked on r/the_donald for pointing out their BS but to be fair, they have an explicit rule that you have to be a fan of his to post there (I'm not). Unless I'm mistaken, this is a forum for discussion of Bitcoin, including doses of reality. If the mods want to make a rule that all posts have to be naively pro-Bitcoin, that's fine and I just won't make posts.

It makes zero sense to compare Bitcoin "mining" with proper mining. Compare it to other currency transactions and it is wildly more inefficient. And in reality, that power is almost entirely generated from coal which is extremely dirty. But even if it weren't, it's a huge amount of energy being applied to magic invisible points which randomly appear and disappear.
@_date: 2018-01-19 05:33:46

Even if that's true (which I don't believe it is but I am definitely more ignorant about this question than you), the run on GPUs is inarguably because of this. Actually making these devices takes time and resources but all kind of transactions and mining from bots can be done instantaneously which is also the reason why the Bitcoin blockchain is backed up with over [100,000 unconfirmed transactions]( (and that has been true for several weeks).

The latter is not ostracizing thru association: it's just empirical. Arguing that pedophiles use Bitcoin is a misdirection (they use cash, too--that's no reason to outlaw it) but saying that magic Internet points use a preposterous amount of electricity and that is consequently a drain on the environment is true.
@_date: 2019-03-23 18:02:32


No, I'm not. I'm being entirely genuine and bringing up what I believe are actual valid concerns. You can disagree but a claim about being disingenuous is just not true.


Remind me of when the "financial system" collapsed. And please explain how Bitcoin helped or would have helped in any meaningful way.
You can find *Foreign Policy* objectionable&amp;mdash;that's fine&amp;mdash;but the fact that it has a reputation and an editorial staff make it inherently different than a self-published platform. So, again, I'm asking if you have any sources that aren't Blogspot or Tumblr or LiveJournal.
@_date: 2019-03-22 07:21:48
There is literally a 0% chance of Bitcoin replacing our current financial system, plus that actually generates real and demonstrable wealth, unlike Magic Internet Points.
I'd be very interested in seeing some data to support a majority of Bitcoin electrical power coming from renewables but even if that were true it's still taking renewable energy from something productive and useful&amp;mdash;there's a finite amount of trees and waves and steam from the Earth's core that we can turn into useful energy.
@_date: 2019-03-23 07:06:19
Not trolling: Bitcoin is a joke. It's fine to spend a little bit of resources on hobbies but not a lot, so when it becomes a big deal, then someone needs to push back. That's not "fud" it's just being realistic. If you think that there is any chance of a global financial system collapse and Internet Magic Points replacing it, you are out of your gourd.
Thanks for the sources about renewables; non-self-published sources would be nice but it's a start.
@_date: 2019-03-23 17:39:33
Hm. Lots to unpack here but some hi-lites:


All I am concerned with is 1.) the mammoth drain on resources and 2.) pie-in-the-sky nonsense evangelism. Otherwise, if you want to trade Magic Internet Points for POGs or whatever, go for it.


lol. Why do you believe this?


... Please try re-reading: Medium.com is a *self-published* source and *Foreign Policy* is a respectable journal with an editorial staff. Do you not see the difference?

It's hardly professor-worship, it's just taking with a grain of salt what some guy on the Internet says. I'm willing to agree that you have a more sophisticated understanding of this than I do, so I'm interested in seeing how they would respond to your critique. Calling them idiots who have no idea what they're talking about is so incredulous that I don't believe it for a moment.

such as Bitcoin’s must simultaneously satisfy two conditions in equilibrium: (1) a zero-profit
condition among miners, who engage in a rent-seeking competition for the prize associated
with adding the next block to the chain; and (2) an incentive compatibility condition on the
system’s vulnerability to a “majority attack”, namely that the computational costs of such an
attack must exceed the benefits. Together, these two equations imply that (3) the recurring,
“flow”, payments to miners for running the blockchain must be large relative to the one-off,
“stock”, benefits of attacking it. This is very expensive! The constraint is softer (i.e., stock
versus stock) if both (i) the mining technology used to run the blockchain is both scarce and
non-repurposable, and (ii) any majority attack is a “sabotage” in that it causes a collapse in
the economic value of the blockchain; however, reliance on non-repurposable technology for
security and vulnerability to sabotage each raise their own concerns, and point to specific
collapse scenarios. In particular, the model suggests that Bitcoin would be majority attacked
if it became sufficiently economically important — e.g., if it became a “store of value” akin to
gold — which suggests that there are intrinsic economic limits to how economically important
it can become in the first place.

Has Bitcoin been a stable and useful worldwide storage medium for wealth for two millennia prior to finding a huge deposit of these Magic Internet Points in the mountains of California?
If you look at 1849, that's a perfect example of scavengers picking apart a boom-and-bust cycle, hucksters trying to get rich quickly with schemes, and many, many dashed hopes with a small handful of bandits who made out on the backs of others' labor. Are you suggesting that this is what Bitcoin is, because if so, I'm with you.

Except for the part where gold doesn't surge in value by 14,000% and then lose 70% of that value in a few months. That is a pretty salient difference, don't you think?


I, too remember Beanie Babies.
Edit: also gold isn't a currency.
@_date: 2019-04-07 08:58:09
How can it incentivize saving *and* spending simultaneously? You took a hard left midstream there.
Since no one primarily has Bitcoin as a currency (nor should anyone), then it's no surprise that almost all Bitcoins are owned by a very small percentage of wallets and somewhere between 20 and 25% are permanently lost and will never be spent.
@_date: 2019-04-08 00:16:42

@_date: 2019-04-07 16:05:51
If Bitcoin were ever a globally adopted currency, then it would only ever be an auxiliary one, like gold was and has been for exactly this reason. But gold is not this volatile or easy to game.
