Tokyo Bitcoin Meetup?  Where are you guys at?  And the rest of Tokyo bitcoiners for that matter?  I had 0 coins with MtGox but if I was within a few hours I'd be there any chance I had.  
  
This is pure bullshit, Mark K acts like he's the CEO of a 10000 employee conglomerate... even many of those people would stand and explain themselves to someone who spent over $1000 to stand outside their doors.  
  
MtGox is fucking with everyone's bitcoins by actively lowering the trust of ALL established exchanges and thus the value of our network and coins.  Here, watch this:  
  
NOW!  Go outside, get on your bike/car/bus/subway, stand with this guy, hold up your signs and yell up to Mark, say "WE'RE AS MAD HELL, AND WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE THIS ANYMORE!"

I don't agree with his attitude, but one must take responsibility for having so much wealth in an emerging, unregulated currency while simultaneously keeping that currency in a marketplace that has had a history of issues and bad press.  
  
I don't doubt that you do take that level of responsibility as you did not knock that nice coffee out of his hand and are not trying to incite a riot.  
  
That being said, the free market self corrects through consumer reactions and everyone that believes in the free market should be supporting your efforts to hold Mark and MtGox accountable for their poor service, product and public relations.  
  
Free market forces affect Bitcoin as a whole and if the community wants more people to buy in (raising the value of everyone's coins) we should be showing the world that we do hold our service providers to a high standard and are willing to act to enforce this standard.
  
Keep fighting the good fight, I wish you had a conk shell you could blow to call all Japan Bitcoiners to your aid.
