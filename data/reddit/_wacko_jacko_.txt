Too bad I have no way to buy it with my 16 months of no-interest credit because Coinbase is lame...

No you're only supposed to touch the tips.

Downvote all you want, but fact is I pay my balances in full when the billing period ends and my credit score is exceptional, especially for individuals in my age-group of mid-20's (~780) when you consider I have an ongoing accumulation of student debt (albeit in a worthwhile STEM field). So right there you made a conclusion about my finances and budgeting-ability... I'm not a monkey like most people on here and have the capacity to keep a running Excel spreadsheet with regard to my finances to help me make educated buying decisions.
Sorry, but if there's an oppertunity to buy and I don'get paid for another week, I'm using revolving credit to buy the dip then pay if off in full and pay no interest. And in the process I was collecting 2% cashback rewards so I was actually making money byway of two avenues. ���� But keep downvoting because you misunderstand my intentions and process. Not to mention my largest buy-in ever was $500 and my largest credit limit is around $5,000. I'm not exactly a big-player. I'm just a long-term HODLer hoping to turn a decent profit in the next decade or so.

I can afford it in like 3 days dude chill. I get paid in strange intervals and credit is an easy way of getting around my shitty payout dates. Nothing insane here.
