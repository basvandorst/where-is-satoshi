Cash machine withdrawals will be capped until 6 July. Many machines are already reported to have run out of bank notes, although the government said ATMs should “operate normally again by Monday noon at the latest”.

I guess unstoppable because of the network effect, the technological innovation and societys mistrust of banks, politicians etc at an all time high. 
It's not unpopular with the public it's just not easy to understand it and most people believe what they read in the press or see on tv. Once they look into it themselves they will have a more informed opinion.
I'm not predicting that, just more friends of family of those of us already using bitcoin will increase. Unfortunately that is not most of the western world, that's a good few years off yet..

seriously, don't bother trying to get your friends onboard, it's a waste of your precious time and energy right now. Just read up on bitcoin, blockchain and watch as many bitcoin talks as possible, become the most knowledgeable person on bitcoin in your group, school, town etc. Keep buying small amounts of bitcoin if possible, (don't tell ANYONE how many you own). By the time the year is out you will be the go to guy for bitcoin advice and you may well be able to make a few dollars helping your friends get into the blockchain party.

@_date: 2014-11-19 21:15:48
Personally I never had a preference  but once I started tipping it made sense to do it in bits. 'A million bits make a bitcoin' seems a simpler way to measure the units. I never quite got my head around milli-bits etc. I think the average person does not equate bits with computers, I know I don't and I'm quite average.

My accountant treats my btc holdings as foreign currency any gains in value will be taxed, any losses in value tax deductible. Payments in bitcoin are valued on the ££ exchange rate the day it's paid. I paid £200 worth of bitcoin today for services rendered. The btc actually cost me about £150 so probably some number crunching has to be done on the accounts part. One benefit of bitcoin is prompt payment, sometimes I have to chase clients for 3 months to get paid, when bitcoin is fully incorporated into my business my cash flow will improve dramatically..

@_date: 2014-05-05 20:44:40
How I see it, is that 'everyone' will want a piece of the blockchain eventually or make use the blockchain in some way and you need bitcoins to do that. Therefore as the myriad of uses for the blockchain technology evolve, bitcoins will become more sought after.

it's not a 1% transaction fee. There is no transaction fee apart from the standard  miner fee. The 1% is for withdrawals and is waived till Jan 2015. So if you have $100 in your changetip account next spring and want to withdraw it will cost you £1. Problem?

Im no expert but maybe within the next decade the majority of Mining could be done by developing countries like South America, Africa, India and Asia.  If it becomes unprofitable to mine in the developed countries the redundant mining equipment could be 're-tooled' and put back to use. 
This would give a greater spread of miners throughout the globe increasing the difficulty and ineffectiveness of any attempted 51% attack -which in any case doesn't seem worth the money, time and effort to pull off right now.

I prefer to send important transactions with a higher fee to speed up confirmation time. Sometimes I'll send a non-urgent  transaction with a very low fee. Mostly its the standard .0001
Personally I feel smaller blocks will stunt the growth and adoption of Bitcoin and I don't want to have to rely on the off-chain networks (which aren't at all ready for mass consumer use yet) for day to day stuff.  
I'm no expert but I'm sure Satoshi never meant blocks to be capped at 1mb for ever?

 Conclusion
Bitcoin is certainly one of the most interesting recent developments in modern monetary economies. Itenables users to make secure and quasi-anonymous payments. Although many users value the private nature of bitcoin, some government officials seem to be concerned. Specifically, they note that bitcoinmight facilitate illicit transactions and disrupt government activities like conducting monetary policy andraising revenues. For these reasons, some governments have attempted to ban or discourage the use ofbitcoin.
We have considered the extent to which these government efforts might be successful. In the existingliterature, similar considerations have been made by employing random matching models. However, therandom matching protocol is not well suited for questions of monetary competition and control. Ourmodel, in contrast, endogenizes the matching process: an agent preferring to transact with bitcoin mightavoid those holding the currency favored by government. This means that, except in the case where allbitcoin is held by the government, some transactions are effectively (though only probabilistically) beyond
the reach of the state.
Employing a monetary model with endogenous search and random consumption preferences, wefind that the government’s refusal to accept bitcoin is not typically sufficient to prevent their acceptancein equilibrium. The government must be of a particular size to prevent the circulation of bitcoin andthe size threshold depends crucially on the fraction of agents willing to accept currency. Interestingly,
our work suggests that bitcoin might continue on as a niche money, even if the government proactivelydiscourages its use, so long as some individuals are sufficiently committed to accepting bitcoin.

when we're talking about accounts that will withdraw at most £100 a 1% fee is not huge. If you had $10,000 then yes 1% is fairly large. 
I don't see this as a problem when your average joe is quite happy going to payday loans for $100 at some stupid thousands % interest rate. 
@_date: 2017-02-02 15:00:42
Well I'm guessing you don't know much about history and the rise of facism in Europe then if you think Nazis burning books is akin to stopping Nazis speaking in public...
 I have no problem with disrupting Nazis wherever they are. There's nothing you can do about it so I wouldn't lose any sleep over it and posting a weak defence on reddit does nothing to change things. 
Am i right?

It'll pass. It'll soon get boring once they realize tipping tiny amounts doesn't make them more attractive to the opposite sex. No one likes a stingy tipper but everyone loves a high roller.

someone got pepper sprayed supporting a wanker, what's your point? I bet you were really angry when protesters got maced by the cops at the various protests over the last few years, no? 
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:58:41
People are inherently selfish. If they can't see anything in it for themselves (with minimum effort or risk) and don't understand the technology, they're not going to be interested until Bitcoin is ubiquitous and they feel compelled to get some.

Yes, it was easier than offering it for free. I would recommend doing it as an easy way to get lots of people informed about bitcoin. You could always just get £5 of them for bitcoin and go the rest for free, I charged because I paid for lots of printed info to give them on top of my time and effort. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:01:37
You shouldn't have sold. That way you'd still have all your investment. Just saying.

@_date: 2016-01-12 18:58:56
And it got more results than offering it for free. But I also think it's a good time for it, the sceptics can see that it's still around and the curious are fed up of not understanding it. Its the perfect time to do it IMO.

Mate, I've been educating my friends for free for the last two years. I'm that mental friend who bangs on about bitcoin all the time. Now I just let them come to me because they know I've got all the knowledge, saves them having to do the legwork. I charged money for my time and so they'd take it seriously. 
It took me two years to get the first 20 friends to understand Bitcoin and then 3 hours to get the following 20. Do the maths..

The early adopters of bitcoin are geeks, speculators and entrepreneurs.  It also scares mainstream society because it turns all their notions of statehood,  money creation and value transfer on its head.  For my part 80% of my friends are 'social justice warriors'  who should be all over Bitcoin.  I've been sharing Bitcoin info with them for over 3 years now and less than 10% of them understand it today (although that figure is finally increasing). I figure most are lazy,  some are just a bit slow and the rest like to moan about stuff but don't want to do anything constructive other than sign petitions and share Facebook posts.

Gold is old and on the way out (asteroid mining). A new type of value and store of value is emerging through bitcoin. But people need to compare it to gold for the time being, that will decline in the long term.

like i say this has been an impending issue for over 18+ months 
see peter todds vid from may 2013 regarding bigger blocks. 
the way i see it is that mike and gavin got fed up with no progress being made on the scaling issue and decide to release xt to give the other devs a kick up the backside, it worked as now we're seeing bips 100/101 being suggested for bitcoin core. 
@_date: 2015-08-04 22:19:01
You're fired!

It looks nice but $199 just seems to expensive. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 18:48:24
Correct me if I'm wrong but hasn't this big block issue been on the table for some 18months+? The impression I get is that the release of XT now is due to no other suitable solution being touted and time is running out? 
@_date: 2015-08-04 12:06:20

The thing that disappointed me about MN was that originally, Mojo was going to be worth something. There would be genuine value and scarcity associated with it. Then everything went wrong. Due to bugs in the system and some shady operators, people found ways to steal Mojo from other players. They were hacking their clients to exploit features of the protocol that didn't work well in an adversarial environment. So MN had to start giving Mojo away to its testers, and pretty soon you could get as much as you wanted.
The ironic thing is that the only reason people tried to steal and horde it was because they hoped it would someday be valuable. That never happened, in part because of the effects of their own actions.

Known brainwallets not personal ones. There's many known brainwallets and scammers could prob scam some scamees somewhere along the line. Thus database would help reduce that in the future, I guess?

ummm, they're not going to claim it so no, it's not a waste. 
@_date: 2016-02-16 09:32:42
Agreed 
@_date: 2015-07-08 19:38:30
There's some truth in that. I'd say programmers can see far into the future but only business minded people know how to get them there.

I never thought Gavin was working for the government until he let slip recently the questions he first asked satoshi, which were all about how old he was and where he was from. Nothing about why he created Bitcoin Classic cop stuff and made me have my doubts, especially after his tweet the other day calling some unamed core devs assholes. If they are government sponsored then they're getting angry they're not getting anywhere

Great line up. Good luck and look forward to seeing the results.
Maybe they could discuss building a Ninja dev team that is solely focused on Bitcoin 'doomsday' scenarios and how to protect the network against them going forward. 
Kinda like a boffins A-Team....

Shit! Have you not heard the news? 
@_date: 2016-02-04 13:20:20
Bitcoin is very different from the internet and as such it will take longer to permeate society. Also a lot of people have never had a conversation about money and where it money comes from so it's going to take a while for people to get used to the fact that our money doesn't have to be created by banks and governments. 
@_date: 2016-02-03 09:29:44
Grow up. 
@_date: 2016-02-25 01:06:01
Great news. I'm guessing you've seen this already? If not it's worth looking at: 
@_date: 2015-07-17 15:24:23
Yeah. I'd wager we'll have our first pre-teen bitcoin millionaire within the next 3-5 years. Bitcoins killer app will most likely emerge from a classroom not a boardroom.

A few small tips so far

You'd think
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:31:12
Seriously. It's probably not worth your time. They'll get it eventually, in the meantime teach your friends who are interested how to use and secure bitcoin. They'll work the rest out themselves, if they want to.

Get a 21 bitcoin computer and start creating new ways to earn bitcoin instead of trying to mine for it? 
@_date: 2015-09-07 00:34:11
Maybe could give them bitcoin.com ? I know you want to recoup the money spent on it but perhaps you could get some ad revenue in return? It would be good for Bitcoin and good for you.

@_date: 2015-09-03 19:12:15
Nobody came forward with a timely solution so he did what he thought was the best solution at the time. You should do some research on the history of this issue, its been on the cards for quite a while and we need a viable long-term solution now, not next year when we hit the wall.

Mining could move to developing countries where power is virtually free (solar/wind/hydro) and the buying power of bitcoin is 10× developed countries. I can't see China dominating mining in 10yrs time unless the value is 10× what its currently worth.

I propose a planet without guns. You may say I'm a dreamer..I'm not the only one. 
And anyway, the people with guns who might want to take away your guns have bigger guns than you.
I understand that Americans have been brainwashed to think guns keep them safe but that fallacy endangers the rest of us. 
And who profits from gun sales? The military industrial complex not your average citizen.

I just had a nice email exchange with him, here's his final answer:
I know there are two sides to this debate, even if cable TV is a game where you take one side and stick to it.
 
But setting that aside, my angle on this issue is that I know a lot about the history of money. The key to successful money is trust. Gold commanded trust because everybody knew the supply was limited. Fiat money sometimes commands trust if it is issued by central banks with a history of not expanding its supply irresponsibly. A new form of money is always going to face an uphill climb. But if it is created by someone whose precise identity is unknown, and if it is based on code whose particulars are unclear to users who are not programmers, it lacks the characteristics that has made money succeed in the past.
 
Of course, the past does not always anticipate the future, and technology has upended many of our assumptions. I also get that bitcoin can make transactions easier and cheaper. But money is not just a way of transacting—a “medium of exchange.” It is a long-term store of value. That is where the trust comes in. The jury’s out; we’ll see if bitcoin can surmount that hurdle.
 
I should get back to work, but I enjoyed the interruption.
 
Best, Sebastian

Thank you for your message. Sincerest apologies for the issues caused - we understand how frustrating it is that your Xapo Debit Card is not working at such a pivotal moment in bitcoin history as the price is going to the moon!
Unfortunately, we have just been informed that there is an overarching issue with payment processing for the Debit Cards. Right now it looks like our third party payment processor is declining multiple transactions, while some 60% of transactions are still getting approved normally. Unfortunately, there seems to be no real pattern to define which type of transactions are getting approved and which are not - at this time.
Our card issuer is working together with the payment processor to fix this issue ASAP.
As soon as the issue has been solved, we will let you know!

in respones to the question: what's the advantage over bitcoin? 
Thanks for your interest in Tibado.
 
There’s no quick answer to your question because it really depends on what you are trying to do. Both Tibado and Bitcoin are aimed at electronic cash but in totally different ways and with different assumptions. The core difference is in the architecture where Bitcoin uses the decentralised Blockchain to manage a virtual currency and Tibado uses a centralised Blockchain based on fiat currency. There is no speculative element with Tibado.
 
Bitcoin is well established and Tibado is very new but Tim Jones, my cofounder and I believe there is a real need for cash with an electronic form factor. So Tibado apart from being anonymous is immediate and irrevocable and has zero transaction fees because it doesn’t have the proof of work necessary for the Blockchain consensus. Our business model is based on seigniorage just like cash.
 
We intend to make a developer web site available in December and hope people will experiment further to see if it meets their particular needs but at core it’s very good at handling instant low value payments in high volume and we see that sort of payment profile increasing on the internet over the next few years and believe that zero transaction fees will be an important characteristic to many merchants. Whereas Bitcoin is an ownership transfer model, Tibado is an asset transfer model where the users look after their own coins.
 
There a lot of information on our web site but I’m happy to answer any particular questions you may have.
 
Best regards,

50% pre-mine. That can't be good. Even if they 'give away' 90%. 
"StartCOIN will donate 90% of the pre-mined coin to projects and active users of StartJOIN"
The first official giveaway is an August 1st “air drop” this week of 25 START to each registered user of StartJOIN.com. Assuming that 1.64 million users will not register by that time, a majority of the pre-mined coins seem likely to remain out of circulation till some later date.

If you're going to tip, tip large or go home. I like to throw $20-50 tips out to bitcoin sceptics occasionally, knowing they won't collect it. And if they do,  all good. Tips under $5 are not worth it right now. It's just gives naysayers an excuse to ridicule tipping.

I opened a neteller account and deposited bitcoin. I didn't realise that I could just click the link and my wallet apps would process it. Instead I just copied the address to pay. but made an error with the amount. Payment didn't process to my account but the bitcoin went. They are sorting it out for me but they don't really understand his easy it is to verify the payment by blockchain. Yet I guess. I made another test payment for £9 and that deposited OK. Tried to deposit on PS but minimum transfer is £10 :-) but its there and it works :-)

The Political Economy of Bitcoin
Abstract:      
The recent proliferation of bitcoin has been a boon for users but might pose problems for governments. Indeed, some governments have already taken steps to ban or discourage the use of bitcoin. In a model with endogenous matching and random consumption preferences, we find multiple monetary equilibria including one in which bitcoin coexists with regular currency. We then identify the conditions under which government transactions policy might deter the use of bitcoin. We show that such a policy becomes more difficult if some users strictly prefer bitcoin because they can avoid other users holding currency in the matching process.
