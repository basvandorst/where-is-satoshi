The problem IS technology: miners are awarded 4000 BTC daily and they cash out 90% - paid for by gullible hodlers.
The mining algorithm is Bitcoin's strenght AND weakness. Partial proof-of-stake may fix this, but will take 2-3 years to hard fork. Until then, competitors like Ripple may go mainstream before Bitcoin can catch up.

Centralized systems are also more efficient. The security cost of Bitcoin is billions of USD spent on mining rigs.

The big joke is, the Bitcoin blockchain records all transactions. This is exactly what governments want: to track where you spend your cash. You bet governments will adopt blockchain-technology.
@_date: 2014-10-04 16:20:01
You forgot "1 billion USD annual miners' fees", which kind of kills it. See Nicolas Courtois et al

Printing fiat is still cheaper than mining Bitcoin. We need to fix the mining cost problem.
@_date: 2014-12-26 19:53:58
Centralization has two advantages: 1. everyone trusts the central authority (by force); 2. economies of scale advantages. 
With Bitcoin, the cost of securing the network through mining costs a $1B per year, which can't compete with centralized networks. In order for Bitcoin to succeed, the mining algorithm needs to go. (partial) proof-of-stake is the only future for Bitcoin. But other systems may beat Bitcoin to mass adoption, like Ripple (as much as Bitcoiners dislike it, the general public does not care).

All bubble is feedback loop.
The logic goes like this: I have Bitcoins. There is good news, but the prices does not go up. This makes me feel insecure, so I decide to dump my coins. The price goes down. This makes other hodlers insecure and they also dump.

The CEO of Bitcoin died.

How exactly does Bitcoin destabilize governments? I don't see that happening. And I don't think Bitcoin is a tool to do so. Bitcoin has a positive use case: the people's private money, like self-issued electronic food stamps. Which does not necessarily destabilize anything.
@_date: 2014-12-24 18:37:14
They still have to cash out BTC to USD. And then you'll be like Charlie Shrem. In jail for laundering a million dollars. So this comparison is wrong.

and then there's Bitcoin's "super dodgy" cryptography that needs a security patch,

Graphs shows Bitcoin is no longer a bubble. It's just a deflated mess.

Actually, Bitcoin is centralized in the hands of 3 core devs, who do not even document what they do.

Bitcoin has scarcity. If more people want to use it, price goes up.

Their CEO needs to be arrested for running a tiered Ponzi scheme. His actions are already criminal under law, there just need to be police reports filed against him.

You think Coinbase is bad. A friend of mine went to BitPay's after-work drink at their Amsterdam office, to be greeted by two police detectives who just happened to be there all day. BitPay and Coinbase have the long arm of the law up their a holes.

Adoption? This might be the point when miners start dumping Bitcoin for more profitable coins.

Came accross this. I think this is a pretty important use case for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-12-21 20:51:21
Ripple has a business model and use case, unlike Bitcoin. I spoke to several cryptographers on Bitcoin and they warn of its poor design, especially the mining scheme which leads to predictable "programmed cell-death" as miners switch to other coins that are more profitable. The people who can understand the technology have a very different opinion from those who pump the coin for speculation. Bitcoin will change nothing, but the blockchain technology might.

All hail the Kraken!

One major barrier is that Bitcoin is slow as a horse and carriage. 1 hour confirmations, really? With Ripple and Stellar you can place online bets and get confirmation in seconds.

Won't work. Coinbase/BitPay will keep tracking your addresses. If your coins go to drugs/gambling, they'll shut down your account with them. I can imagine Bitstamp having to do the same in the near future.

Trezors are hardware and known to break down. You may lose all your coins when they do, so you'll always need multiple paper wallet backups.

"feelings about Africans?" She is referring to specifically the 1 guy that moments earlier harassed her to marry him, and others who behave similarly. And she referred to "Ghaneans" - a nationality, like "French people suck". You can say that. All I learned from this is that Ghanean harassers are a bunch of assholes. And indeed, being white does not mean being rich, which is apparently the (racist!) perception of Ghanean harassers.

Bank transfers are reversible / recallable. Europe's SEPA transactions can be recalled up to 10 business days, and I've seen special cases where bank accounts were frozen up to months after suspicious transfers.
In other words: Bitsquare, although well intended, is merely a theoretical masturbation that will never work.

The fact he refuses to say which one... shouts SCAM.
The fixed $20 PayCoin is a trick: at some point in time they will simply decide to stop backing it, but keep the $ they have and the ScamCoin will be worth shit. All the while the mining of the coins was paid for by cloud miners...
This is truly an innovation in scam-tech.
