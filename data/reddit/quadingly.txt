Isn't that the bitcoiner motto?

It would not be a hard fork to do so. Block rewards are voluntary. I generally see the claim that halvings will cause MORE than double the value, so as long as it's higher than that it's rational mathematically to do so.

I'm not confused, that is what I mean exactly. If halvings raise the price by at least 100.1% then it's rational mathematically for miners to half intentionally even when not forced to, and bitcoin core code allows them to do this.

If the halving effect is actually strong enough even one person doing it could be enough.

"bitcoin is intrinsically valuable simply because we denote value to it."
Isn't that the exact opposite of "intrinsic value"? Isn't that the exact definition of "extrinsic value"?

Bitcoin just always seems so absurdly more complicated than traditional money. I can just give my bank account to my children without having to make them play myst and hiring 5 separate lawyers. How is this the future?

It absolutely is how the protocol works. Blocks with a coinbase higher than the current are invalid, blocks with a coinbase transaction for less than the current maximum are perfectly valid.

Intrinsic value absolutely exists. Things with intrinsic value are the things you'd still want to own in a universe everything was free and you could have anything. If you mean it's not a physical property of an item I guess you are right. But people would want some pizzas even if there was no external value placed on them because people want to consume a pizza on it's own and not for a reward.

(I may be pointing out that people's jerk off fantasy of halvings leading to great wealth can't possibly be correct)

Uhh, I am pretty sure that miners have gotten very rich by forming cartels that mine less than the maximum amount of stuff they physically could. That is like the entire basis of the oil economy

Bitcoin mining allows them to create less coins voluntarily.

If bitcoin can be killed so easy then wouldn't it be in the miner's rational self interest to hire out their ability to kill bitcoin to the people that wanted to kill bitcoin?
