Well I've bought coin at 15, 30, 150, 900, 1000, 900, and now 150 in that order. I'm gonna buy more if it gets back to 30...

Literally, the largest early investor exchange in bitcoin. They were trading back when it was less then a dollar. That site made a sinful amount of money on commissions how did they fuck up so bad...?

Sure more people know about bitcoin, but what they know about it is you can really get screwed over lol. I know "all press is good press" but in this instance, I don't know how many investor converts are going to materialize from this recent coverage.

I at one time held 500 bitcoins in blockchain then I moved them to Mt. Gox to panic sell, oh my gosh talk about silliness. Regardless if it makes you feel better I've worked at a nursing home for many years, there were many wealthy people who would give all their fortune just to have their youth/health back. Trust me, life experiences are worth more then anything money can give you. Invest in yourself (education) and it will payoff it more ways then just a good job, I met many life long friends at my school, had some great life opportunities come my way as well because of it. If you really want to, you can always buy back in, if it does go up that much then it wont matter you bought it again later. Just don't count on bitcoin being your "ticket" into personal wealth, that's part of the illusion that everyone has. For every dollar you make in bitcoin someone is losing it, it's really just a very exotic way of gambling. Best of luck to you!

bummer dude, fortunately I think your losses could be recouped, just go mow some lawns this spring you'll make that back in no time

I hope people see the humor in this
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:02:01
That's true, I live in a larger city but public transit is not an option. I do bike almost everywhere but being a gigging musician it's not really an option for my work. Hope things work out for you I lost a similar amount :/

I'm sorry, mt. gox is the only reason I still occasionally check this silly subreddit anymore. Let's stop posting news everytime there is a new company that lets you buy giftcards with your bitcoin. You realize how easy it is to cash out your coin and just spend the cash..? Bitcoin is a exotic gambling bet, the only market that effectively uses as currency is it drugs. I'm sorry but that's just plain talk. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:47:19
No, it's definitely as bad as it gets right now. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:41:47
party like it's 2013!!!
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:56:24
I think you're getting at the heart of the matter.
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:57:04
If someone bailed gox out I would love them forever...
@_date: 2014-03-31 01:53:13
u mad bro? but to be fair, you do bring up a very valid point of debate. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:30:10
no aborting you was a stupid decision
@_date: 2014-02-20 17:08:36
But that's just it, how does having fiat make it any easier to get money out??
@_date: 2014-03-10 18:47:09
its actually the only news I care about :/

Paypal can take directly from your bank, it also has gift options where no fees are charge to seller or buyer. Just something to consider. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 01:55:00
Fair enough, but let's say bitcoin does go main stream then how does that make it any better then visa? There will always be fees with any sort of payment.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:00:09
107 btc, ironically my van broke down yesterday too. I am a gigging musician and I need my van to work and this weekend is mardi gras. ALSO I just bought a new sound system, I had to put a few thousand on credit I was hoping the Mt. Gox thing would blow over. My ship is not totally sunk but if I need to get a new van I'm definitely up a creek.

Bitcoin was one crazy roller coaster but I could never go back
@_date: 2014-04-04 05:11:17
When I first got into bitcoin I held for awhile. Then I knew Mt. Gox was the largest exchange and was the primary means in which the value was calculated. After the crash about a year ago I decided to put my coins in a market so I could try my hand at trading. Over a year I never had one issue until they halted withdrawals. When I first got into it I didn't even know other exchanges existed, since then I just went with what worked. How does that make me greedy? 
@_date: 2014-03-06 07:24:53
Oh yeah, so we're getting our assets back???
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:11:50
umm proof? lol

Just finish your education, trust me if you land a half decent job after school you can make way more then that. It's crazy when you're an adult and you actually have a disposable income.

I would try to avoid selling your car, it's pretty necessary for a job
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:59:09
Why would I not just use USD to buy shoes clothes food gas internet video games computers? 
@_date: 2014-04-05 11:59:02
I'm sorry, if you can't trust the largest legitimate public bitcoin related site to keep your funds safe who can you trust? It's not like they were some shady darkweb site. I didn't get a smart phone until last month so how would I have used an offline wallet? 
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:00:16
ughhh lol
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:34:43
Well, they definitely didn't give any notice. As far as repercussions unless someone goes vigilant what do you foresee happening? A convenient theft of an untraceable digital currency that no body can prove or disprove?

@_date: 2014-04-04 05:13:18
so true...
@_date: 2014-03-10 18:35:38
Mostly cause the drama, shit is entertaining. Also I've got a pipe dream that someday mt. gox will make *some* sort of reparations, long shot I know but still better odds then the lottery...
@_date: 2013-12-13 03:23:44
wow I might actually end up spending my btc...
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:00:19
to clarify, i meant in general this could be the lowest we see it, I think bitcoin is going to jump back up pretty quickly, it's got too much going for it
@_date: 2013-05-07 19:24:04
it's also a great spiced rum
