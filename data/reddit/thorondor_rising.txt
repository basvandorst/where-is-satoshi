Market dove on 10/23 when the Bakkt futures came to fruition.  2 days later, Bakkt needs to re-up on BTC to award their November futures positions.  Price bounces back.  Wouldn't be surprised if we settled back on 10k over the weekend, restoring the price to its equilibrium prior to Bakkt launch.

What have you been doing for the past 19 months?  Have you bothered to buy more to bring your average cost down?

Not tripping.  Just accumulating.

I go 80% btc, 20% nymt, and i take the quarterly dividend payouts and buy more shares of nymt with them.
When btc tanked last month i sold and rebought at the same price for the tax break.
Index funds are a joke right now, with last years 3rd quarter growth forecasts anticipating 2% year over year growth.  Looks like its not even going to accomplish that with just a hair over 1% year over year after todays 0.6% loss at close on the three major US indexes.  Nymt tossing a stable 13% dividend payout on 6$/share is way better than the market growth rate.

If I would've needed to sure, but that's not how RH 1098s you.

There seems to be a lot of articles posted to my newsfeed today about bitcoin going into a downtrend.  Seems the media shills are being paid to propagandize fear again.  I guess this means it's time to buy more bitcoin while they attempt to scare away shaky hands so they can reap the gains themselves.

San Francisco is **not** a shithole?  Have you seen the shitmaps?  They literally shit on the sidewalk, right outside of your rundown 1million+ dollar rinky-dink apartment/condo there.

Stupidest thing you can do after seeing a large gain; sell on an exchange that 1098s you at the end of the fiscal year during a momentary downturn, only to buy right back in at the stabilization point, and owe a shitload of taxes at the short-term investment rate, with all of your cash locked back into an asset that proceeds to slowly go down over the next few months.
That's precisely how you get into trouble with the IRS.
If you lose faith and panic-sale out, stay out.
