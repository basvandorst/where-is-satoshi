To make it perfectly clear, this hardfork will fail. It is not up to the miners to enforce it, and a majority or supermajority is not in fact sufficient. Even 99% of the miners implementing the new rules  - through, no doubt, the same broken process where disloyal pool masters hijack the blockchain that has been employed by Gavin once before (word to the wise: BTC50/BTCGuild *DIED* for that sin, do you want to die too? - it would still fail.
MP explains it:


















Log of the whole discussion:  (see previous day, too, where it's explained why miners won't be able to afford mining on gavin fork for more than a few minutes anyway).
"A minority opposes it". That minority owns Bitcoin. End of story.

Nothing you say makes any sense whatever. Obviously not everyone who wants will be able to get. Whoever pays will be able to get.
Stop repeating the "no growth without breaking Bitcoin" mantra. Bitcoin is here to break the USG, not the other way around. "Growth" will happen whatever way Bitcoin says it happens.

Also  for good measure.
