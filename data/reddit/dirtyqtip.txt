This is a story from March, but I tried searching for it on reddit and came up empty handed.  What are the implications of this?  [Gavin Andresen, the maintainer of Bitcoin]( responded.  I'm not too tech savvy, can anyone ELI5 and tell me what could go wrong?

I think there exists the possibility that when you set up his rigs and his wallet that you took a copy of his private keys and held onto them.  Then, months later, cleared out your "client's" wallet and posted online asking these questions as an elaborate smoke and mirrors campaign to convince your client that there is no way it could be you.

I think you're off base a bit on this one.  The problem is the gender / race gap in technology (
Since Bitcoin was / is on the bleeding edge of tech, it would seem most probable that males would dominate, but not for the reasons you think.  I tried explaining bitcoin to my girlfriend and she said it sounded stupid.

This should remove the unconfirmed transaction and allow you to re-send it.
