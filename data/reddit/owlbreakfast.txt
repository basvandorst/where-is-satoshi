As a total noob who is lurking around here, trying to get some information...
What does such a machine cost?
And how much you make a day with it (minus electricity costs...)
You think that will pay out in 1-5 years from now if Bitcoin gets more widespread?
Is this just plug and play or do you need technical knowledge to configure everything that you get the best yield?
Will it still be worth it if I invest in such a machine in a few months?

Why cant i withdraw my bitcoin without verification? 
It's only 0.5 and support suspects me of having second account and stuff...thats not true and a real bummer!
