Does Gdax work to the UK? It seems brilliant!

I think that to the average layman coming in, those ideas are hard to grasp or maybe not even talked about. To them it's as simple as bitcoin is the same but slower, and if litecoin has a chance to skyrocket in price it's in earlier stages than bitcoin so they can make more money on it. It's unfortunate, but I think that's pretty much it.

I've been told it handles transactions 4x faster.

I'm not sure how bank wires work and I don't feel comfortable having to wait multiple days both ways, it seems a bit ridiculous. Hence card would be better! Looking at the history of Coinfloor on search results here it doesn't seem too promising, but thank you for the idea!

Which coins do you believe to be better and why? I plan to jump into crypto this week. Thanks.

Hi Molly, thank you for the link! I'm going to look at reviews and such but this looks promising. What fees do you have and at what point are documents needed? I may be getting some ID soon so a rough timeline would be beneficial. Thanks!

Thank you!! I gave these a look and also checked out gdax. Much more confident now and think I can start purchasing. I appreciate the help!
