I like that you tried to use the "&gt;" character.

I agree.
Maybe if before every announcement, he looked at the camera, and said something like "Hey guys/girls/bitcoiners/etc, I have personally written the following statement regarding BLAH, and I suck at improvising/talking to a camera/whatever, so don't be mislead by the monotone/whatever.

HEY YOU!
UTF-8 characters.. I get that there are many many "codes" for characters in UTF-8 (as per [THIS PAGE]( But how can these "codes" be used to create a pass-phrase for an intermediate key?
I'm curious because of the service [BIT-CARD]( has to offer..
@_date: 2014-03-19 00:37:11
Try reading bro :)
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:44:18
YES. YES IT DOES.
@_date: 2014-03-18 02:40:04
Just an idea, have you ever thought about expanding the business to cater for services like [this?](
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:49:36
Makes sense now :)
One last thing, if no address is specified, and the "change" goes to a new wallet, how does one access the funds stored therein? Will the previous private key be the same for the new, undefined "change wallet"?
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:30:56
Yes! Thanks for explaining this!!!
What's your opinion on Mycelium? is it a hosted service that, if it were to fail, your wallet/coin is lost?
EDIT - Also, if you were to spend a fraction of your paper wallet by importing the private key online, I understand the "change" (what's left of the paper wallet balance) is sent to a NEW address/wallet? how does one then access the new wallet? and can you specify where this change goes?
@_date: 2014-03-05 02:52:51
Thank you!

Question - In regards to this part of the "paper storage" article:




If this has to be done to spend, is this a temporary wallet, for one-time spending and such? Or are the funds then essentially stored in an online wallet, thus making the "paper wallet" redundant? 
@_date: 2014-04-02 21:41:59

PROTIP: A private contractor, who is being paid to build a road, usually exists as a company or corporation. That company also has to abide by rules and regulations (because injury/death/sadness = bad). These workplace rules/regulations are defined &amp; *tested* by a Government funded (because, such trust) corporation/branch, &lt;GovSafetyGuaranteed&gt;.

This plan is literally, foolproof. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:21:21
I think the best reaction to this news, is to do nothing.
If everyone using/owning bitcoin does not comply, I don't see this ruling having the "intended" effect. I count that as a win.

I would like to see some sort of source for your claims.
@_date: 2014-03-05 01:31:24


This. Thank you for this thread.
@_date: 2014-04-10 23:48:19
You probably should. Bitcoin is not a mother-fucking-day-trading game.
EDIT: Expect BTC to trend downwards in the wake of China outcomes.
@_date: 2014-04-02 21:22:00
While despair may or may not be the reason for this post, how would it make you feel personally if, in the 2016 elections, the idea of digital currency was not even a talking point for the politicians campaigns?

Generalization. Assumes people can ONLY "outright buy" PC's, every 3 years.


Generalization. Assumes knowledge of all lost/stolen/missing coins.


Fuck you, you nigger fagget cunt.
@_date: 2014-04-01 23:51:16


Does this statement have any factual basis?
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:46:46
This sounds like a great service to push Bitcoin further into general public adoption! 
I hope they can continue to innovate and create an efficient, streamlined process.

If this were my wallet, how would I spend the funds?
I scan the code, get the encrypted private key of: 6PfQoEzqbz3i2LpHibYnwAspwBwa3Nei1rU7UH9yzfutXT7tyUzV8aYAvG
Where would I enter a pass-phrase to show the un-encrypted private key for wallet importing?

Okay, I'm done waiting by the sidelines.
I want to help work on the bitcoin protocol.
Is [GitHub]( the place to start?
I'm not a superb coder/programmer by any means, but I am willing to learn. I believe reading up on desired functions of the blockchain technology would be a good start.
If anyone has advice, I would really appreciate the comment.

PRO TIP - They will never be worth BIG BUCKS. You know how there's early adopters? You my friend, are an early baghodler.

You don't deposit money into an "your" account, and you shouldn't need to be "verified".
Localbitcoins.com is a trade platform for individual people/groups to buy and sell BTC with the use of an Escrow service.
EDIT - AFAIK.

Something something [fallacy](
I'd *guess* we are still in the adoption phase, maybe that's why we are still seeing this volatility. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 00:50:09

What it means is that a service has been created to, you know, SUPPORT THE REQUESTS OF THE PEOPLE WANTING TO TURN BIRD POOPS INTO WALLMART-BUX.
@_date: 2014-04-01 21:56:07
So you see the point I was dancing around?
We rely on the Gov and other corporations, whether it be for safety, standards, law enforcement, whatever. 
I want to ask if there is any way around this system, like the possibility of a slow, global paradigm shift (in a different, but positive direction). It seems like the society we have crafted as a whole for ourselves, only really benefits the top minority (I'm talking upper-class western/other established societies). 
There also seems to be a general sense of comfort for the majority of westerners, with regards to the situation of capitalism in society. Maybe this comforting "just the way the world works" feeling, is a byproduct of the society itself. I know personally, I feel much 'better off' than 90% of the total population. That alone will have some effect in preventing me from starting a movement against any major player in the system.

Backup what? 
How can I used this technology as a fungible store of value EFFORTLESSLY and EFFICIENTLY without having to add increasingly complex passwords to an already overflowing [human] memory bank? 
I don't want to remember long strings of numbers, backup seeds or any other nonsense.

Just asked this in another thread -
How do I actually use this technology as a secure (very hard to steal) store of value EFFORTLESSLY and EFFICIENTLY, without having to add increasingly complex passwords to an already overflowing [human] memory bank?
I don't want to remember long strings of numbers, backup seeds or any other nonsense.
I have a wallet, and it's just a piece of leather. It does a FINE job of holding my other valuables (currency/credit-wise).
How do we actually USE bitcoin..?
