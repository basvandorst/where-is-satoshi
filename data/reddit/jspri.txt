Very cool! If you're looking to compare data against any other restful endpoints. Smartbit (which my team built) indexes all of the addresses amongst others.
Can also sort by balance/address/inputs etc.

I've done this, along with half of the master thus far. I plan on finishing but need some more time due to running a startup and FT work. 
The intro course is great and has some very respected lecturers taking some of the classes. Andrea's also contributes. 
There's no obligations on the introductory class so I think it well worth it. Doing the intro will tell you if the Masters is right for you or not.

Smartbit got to pitch at Fintech Melbourne in front of 400 people among 5 finalist.
We demonstrated Bitcoin Bot which turned on a light from a payment which got some great feedback from the audience. 
Though the pitch night was won by a more traditional fintech company who specialised in providing bank statement data.
This is very early, but we have a beta sign up online for any one that is interested to find out more. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 11:56:39
I looked through the history to find this one for you. Most sites calculate as per your comment, but Smartbit calculates based on actual reward. Meaning miners can take less if they want, and this is what has happened.
@_date: 2015-06-23 14:35:45
I'm about half way through the Masters. The course is fantastic. 
As noted in the other replies, the Intro course is well worth it and gives you an understanding of how the course is structured. The Intro course is obviously much easier and is spread out of a longer period of time.
Here's the course schedule
I suggest doing the introductory course either way.

Yes. Sends a verification code before you can buy. I had to give 3x index finger scans.

I completely agree with you there. I actually wrote 'doesn't effect me... yet'.
And was also why I felt we all need to put discussion into this one and hopefully be able to drive something that supports the ecosystem growth and not stifle it. 
I don't know the answer to this one, maybe non compliant companies such as Changetip will be able to ask their users to agree to their terms   which explicitly states they're not compliant and cannot warrant any loss incurred... &lt;insert legally valid version&gt;
@_date: 2014-07-18 01:04:12
I'm not from New York, so this doesn't effect me yet. I have a couple of opinions on centralised/decentralised, and would be great to have the feedback.
I'm all for decentralised, however services need to exist that are centralised, atleast until the day we're all predominately using bitcoin.
What I mean here, is we need services such as Coinbase and Bitpay at the moment, and the easiest way for new people to get into bitcoin is via a centralised service.
Adding to that, I think we just need to integrate HD and mutlisig and these services could be perfect. I also think different multisig arrangements for different use cases are needed. 
For example, a new user will have their private keys held by coinbase as they currently do, an experienced user can have an option to create a new address via there site with their public keys.
If you push away a centralised service, you'll push away new users. We should be instead pushing for greater flexibility in the architecture.

The total bitcoins is the live amount instead of calculated amount based on block height.
Bitcoin consensus allows miners to accept less than the full reward. A few times, they have calculated the fee wrong and taken this off their reward or experimented with accepting less.

You might just be confusing senget and mainnet. 
[ is a block explorer for the segnet chain. 
Segnet is the chain for development that implements the Segregated Witness proposal, a solution towards scaling.
If you're looking for accurate data and charts on the mainnet, check it out here:

SegWit adds some addtional script types:
  
For developers its a tool to see and test transactions that follows these updates. You could also use the pushtx function and it'll process a valid segwit transaction where as other blockexplorers won't pass these as valid.

Yes you are the owner of the bitcoin. Bitcoin.com.au just asks for a wallet address and they pay out directly. 
They also have wallet guides on their site and are promoting Bitcoin best practices.
If you're in Australia would be great if you could show them your support and let everyone know how it went.
@_date: 2019-06-12 11:56:38
That's a good start. It's a not a simple task and can become more complex if you want all of the data however is doable. 
At  we use a combination of bitcoind and our own nodes built on Nicola's excellent work to parse and store the data. Check out his book along with the suggested readings.

It's only shown if one is detected. Though you can always see the value if you show the object using the code button '&lt;/&gt;'
All transactions have a propagation and double_spend field.
I've taken a screen shot here:
EDIT: all info is shown on mobile as well.
@_date: 2015-08-05 23:08:07
good list!
@_date: 2015-08-10 05:28:41
You've had lots of good replies, and the one thing that is obvious is that there is no right or wrong answer. With 1 confirmation you know that the Transaction is valid, however, it can be reversed if its no longer valid as a result of a re-org.
The risk is not re-orgs but if the transaction contains utxo's that the have also been used in another transaction (a double spend) this transaction may become the valid one. Much less likely when you have 1 confirmation, but possible there is a competing chain.
ShapeShift use a confidence factor, to determine the likely hood of acceptance in a block and double spend detection. Double spend detection I think is pretty cool, but can only happen if you have mutliple views of the blockchain from different locations.
[Smartbit]( has a propagation % and double spend detection on every transaction (you'll need an unconfirmed transaction for propagation % to show up). This confirms whether or not somewhere else is trying to spend the same UTXO.
Whilst a reversal is possible due to a another competing chain also containing utxo's that are used in your transaction, though using a service like smartbit will help with the confidence that the rest of network has seen this happen or not.

As the other replies have suggested, go with Testnet.
Smartbit fully supports testnet on our blockexplorer.

Agree. It's a [Coinspark](  marker in the OP_RETURN. SPKm (0x53 0x50 0x4C 0x6D)
Which can be decoded from the hex: shown here 
OP_RETURN 53504b6d  ....
SPKM = 53504C
According to coinspark 6D = message
The rest of the string is the message data.
You could also see other coinspark transactions by typing 'SPK'..

I realise this is could be subjective, so open to all sides. But we're definitely advocates for the blockchain and its future. 
How is this any different to any Meta layer application? As long as only digest hashes are embedded, and not the documents them self?
A major feature that is promoted for bitcoin is the ability for contracts, such as titles, document proofing, timestamping etc... how do we do this without embedded hashes?
We're a new bitcoin company who is here to promote the benefits. The best way for us to do that is to build really robust tools around it. Feedback such as this will help shape our direction in that we want to build tools that are beneficial for the community. 
Something you may find interesting, out of the 79odd million transactions in the blockchain, only 3300 has DOCPROOF hashes.
Anyway, would appreciate any more information/feedback/advice ?

The balance is calculated on every transaction as some addresses have millions of transactions.
One address (statoshi dice) 3.19 million transactions. 
You can use the payment modal to receive payments and transactions live to an address. Or if you're on an address page that receives a transaction, you'll see the balances update live and the new tx added to the list. Once confirmed, the confirmed balance will also update live.
We have some large highly scalable Amazon RDS provisions.

I agree, merge mining is a solution. From a blockchain explorer platform point of view we're concentrating on bitcoin and making that data easy to find and use etc..
As for a design plan, we have a complete independent testnet system setup. ( 
The plan here is to build out any new features added to bitcoin core. What I would really love feedback on and something we'll need assistance in, is building out the explorer to handle pegged chains/two-way pegged assets. If sidechains was introduced into core, Smartbit will be working hard to include important pegged chain information. I don't know what this will look like yet!
Anyway, cheers for the feedback, certainly understood and appreciated. A feature we added last week, you might find cool, is you can enter Eligius into the search to find detail on the pool or go directly ( Difference from other block explorers, you can sort/page all of the blocks and display the size blocks mined 2GB for Eligius.
Thanks, Jarred.

Just to add another check. Can confirm .251BTC is the correct confirmed balance. Looks like the value is right now, obviously wrong in your object though.
If you would like an API with full transaction model returned instead of first/last tx have a look at the object here
If you're developer building on testnet, our api is pretty extensive. Would appreciate any feedback from someone working with the apis.. Blunt feedback is also all good :)
@_date: 2015-07-30 15:07:59
Haha, good question. Of course not. But it is important that bitcoin is decentralized as much as possible and people have options. There are a couple extremely important use cases for block explorers (IMHO).
1. With the increase in blocksize, SPV's and centralised services (circles &amp; coinbases), users of these services need independent methods for verification. Block explorers provide this data easily and ideally quickly.
2. Bitcoin developers using blockchain api's that don't want to build infrastructure need reliable and fast data. The closer they obtain the data from the quicker the service for the end user will ultimately be. 
The point is not really around Australia, but about providing options. Smartbit's Block Explorer is a global product, but just in its infancy. We hope it comes across as a really mature product, and we're looking for feedback.

The frontend end utilises the angularjs framework connected to our API. Our infrastructure is built on AWS, with nodes across the bitcoin network. The goal is, no matter where a transaction is picked up, we need to display it in milliseconds. 
Only bitcoin core nodes can process consensus data. The 'decode transaction' is a good spot to see bitcoin bitcore process the tx where we display the raw response from bitcoin core.
  you'll need a transaction to decode. You can get this from the more menu on a tx page.
Alternatively you can play with the api on the docs page. All of our API calls are interactive here. Select the Decode transaction card, it'll pick up a tx for you to decode. You could also create a raw transaction, and broadcast it directly here.

* exchange value at time of transaction for address transactions
* display historical exchange rate for transaction at time of transaction
* display historical exchange rate for block at time of block
* historical exchange rate updates with change of currency flag (assuming base currency was exchanged at that time)

The issue I have with the coinjar swipe, is it doesn't seem to be a good business model. As far as I can tell, they cover the fees to make it attractive for users such as yourself. For that reason, whilst it good while the fees are covered, doesn't seem to be sustainable and not something we can push to a bigger audience. I might be wrong, or its changed since I first looked at it. I would be interested in any feedback an every day user has on that?

Not sure exactly what you need. But you can get a list of the confirmed transaction here:
- 
- 
- 
If you have a transaction that you're waiting to get confirmed you can use the subscribe endpoint:
ws.send(JSON.stringify({type: "transaction", txid: "4c1df235ffd7642008989422aee5255e6312b4172b55d94e328fa99e99d727c7"}));
The websocket will notify you when the transaction above is included in a block
@_date: 2016-05-29 00:10:17
oh, thats pretty easy. 
Well the block api provides you all of the transactions in that block
You can always increment by one to get the next block.
If you want to be notified of the new block you can use the blocks web socket.
then subscribe to new-blocks: i.e.:
ws.send(JSON.stringify({type: "new-block"}));
@_date: 2015-10-13 05:32:33

To satisfy your couple points.
1. Need to know all candidates who are going to vote, or at least the number of candidates.
2. Create a Public key for each Voter.
3. Each of the public keys can be hash together in a merkle tree format, with the resulting hash published to the blockchain. The means no additional pubkeys to be added or removed or it fail a verify step.
4. A 2 of 3 multisig address created from a public key handed to a voter and the election officials pubkey (voter will have 1 address).
5. Election officials fund each address given to the voters with the smaller unit, say 1mbtc.
6. Voter uses that address to sign a transactions to a given candidates address. 
7. Votes can the be verified by checking only addresses generated from the public keys were used to calculate votes.
Each step is verifiable on the blockchain and the entire pubkey merkle tree can be published to confirm the full list of voters.

Bitcoin's permanent database allows users to embedded additional data. The most environmentally friendly way is to include this data in the output script of a Bitcoin transaction.
One of the earliest use cases was Proof of Existence which allow users to embed a document proof.
@_date: 2015-10-13 06:24:06
Also, some block explorers that show unconfirmed count filter out old transactions, such as 7 days or greater.
@_date: 2015-10-08 19:07:56
Most do only run on a single Node. Smartbit has many nodes and checks with each of their nodes if the tx has been received or not. Gives propagation estimates and double spend detection

maybe study a transaction from the Smartbit UI, it uses the transaction api. 
All transactions have inputs and outputs. Inputs are the from addresses, and Outputs are the to addresses. 
You need to view a transaction from the point of view of one address. I.e. if your address 1abc, and address 1abc is used as an input, then you 'sent' X amount of btc. If 1abc is in the list of outputs you 'received' x amount of btc. 
Note: outputs always include the change address as well.

A simple explanation would be they are filtering out transactions based on mintxrelayfee by increasing the threshold amount above default. This is the current recommendation to ignore spam transactions.
I can only speak for Smartbit. No filtering above default settings. It's helpful to understand whats happening in the entire network I think.

If you don't want to wait to pass the data and are happy to accept a  database dump, why don't you just use a block explorer and it's api? You've effectively lost the integrity by accepting a data dump anyway.
 
Alternatively, if those services don't suit you need, you can pass the raw files specifically for what you need.

I think we're pretty much on the same page here.
The application used to register can create the pub/priv key pair and voters only need to see their merkle path to ensure it was included, not whole tree.
Various ways a voter can provide the public key to the authority to register intent to vote.
Register intent and provide pub key.
Merkle Root of pubkeys only in the blockchain
The registered user is provided their merkle path to prove their pub key makes up the merkle root.

Of course! I haven't seen crypto_bot around lately? I was thinking of putting it back online if you're not longer running it?
I thought it would be nice to be able to call short addresses directly. This works now as well:

Also, see the great response here on
[Stackoverflow]( on why Bitcoin will never have 21 million.

Depends how you want to do it. 
You can see the Op-returns directly. Alternatively if you want to do it javascript you can call the API
