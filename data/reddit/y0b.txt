It's only Bitcoin storage.

No problem.

Edit: You're 5th and the very last one.
@_date: 2013-12-22 08:33:23
Yes, it's a plastic card.

Auto buy low sell high is cool.

We specialize in selling NFC products. Thirty days is very realistic for us.
However, if delays do occur we'll offer a discount to compensate.
@_date: 2013-12-22 19:22:49
The NFC chip we're using is quite reliable. Also there's a one year warranty for Redditors. Just add in the order notes your username so that we have something to go by if you ever have to claim a replacement.

From Canada to Australia. No problem.

Good job buddy.
@_date: 2013-12-22 07:39:49
You can encrypt the private key so it's a non-issue. We also encourage users to permanently lock the card once they're happy with the data stored on it so others cannot modify the information. A great thing about NFC is that permanent write locks cannot be reversed.

@_date: 2013-12-22 15:54:52
All of our products come with a 90 day warranty. For Redditors we'll extend this to one year. Just write in the notes section (when you order) your Reddit username so that when you want to request a free exchange we have something to go by.
Typically these things should last decades. At least that's what the manufacture rates them at.
@_date: 2013-12-22 07:53:45
I wouldn't see why not. I've saved your comment so that when pre-orders are opened you'll get one for free.
Edit: Free list is full.
@_date: 2013-12-23 05:57:03
I use Recuva too sometimes but it seems to only work with hard drives.
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:48:29
After shipping it will take another 12 days.
@_date: 2013-12-22 08:45:54
Yes it's like a credit card with two NFC chips on either side. The user loads the keys so we never handle that information.
It's not paper, it's PVC and inside will be two Broadcom Topaz 512 NFC chips.
@_date: 2013-12-22 16:49:58
@_date: 2013-12-22 15:53:02
Soon. Just give me a few moments.

We'll start taking pre-orders in 12 hours or so.
@_date: 2013-12-22 17:06:24
No promise for an Android app. It's something we'd like to do though.
@_date: 2013-12-22 08:37:12
@_date: 2013-12-22 08:56:49
Just to be clear. There is absolutely no way to send payments at the moment. I think this is where the confusion lies. The card stores your public key and your encrypted private key and that's it.
If you lose the card, make sure you have the private key saved somewhere like Blockchain.info (with 2-factor authentication so you don't get hacked) or even in plain text inside a TrueCrypt volume.
@_date: 2013-12-22 08:41:01
There are two independent NFC chips inside the card. You write on the 'public' side a URI in the "bitcoin:YOURADDRESSHERE" format and on the 'private' side you write a strong password encrypted private key.
You could use bitaddress.org to generate the wallet and encrypt the private key in BIP38. Preferably in the future we'll have an app to streamline loading the information. The product will come first. No ETA for the app.
For now you'll need to use [TagWriter]( and copy and paste the information in. I'll write a tutorial for when the product launches so don't worry.
@_date: 2013-12-22 09:02:29
I appreciate it.
@_date: 2013-12-22 08:48:52
Do you want one?
@_date: 2013-12-22 18:48:36
This is exactly how it works.
@_date: 2013-12-22 16:50:27
@_date: 2013-12-22 08:47:28
OK. I'll reassign the free spot.
