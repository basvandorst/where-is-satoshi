that would make one coin equal 1/9,700,000,000th. also there are 15 million of these coins.
how else would the market cap 68 Billion USD

Holy shit you’re right

Bush Tax Cuts were flawed because they did not equally reduce government spending. So that doesn’t mean the tax cuts were flawed, it just means our govt half-assed it.

luckily for bitcoin, those with weak hands are mainly just using coinbase which forces them to wait a week.  so during that week they are price watching and are being exposed to its wild pattern. i can only hope that they learn it "always" goes back up in that amount of time

How dull are you? Philanthropy can be good if done the right way. However demanding more from the rich percentage-wise does not lead to long term good.

the Best method if you are serious about putting money in and not withdrawing is to buy with your own order on GDAX and then when the money is available switch it to a hardware wallet offline (Trezor/Exodus/Ledger). that way it is safe and not sitting on an exchange for longer than necessary. put in weekly amounts with whatever you are comfortable with for as long as you are comfortable with. then hold no matter what happens. the second you invest try to develop a mindset where you think you will never see that money again in your life...any profit after that will seem as a surprise.

Ummmm this is a fact that they gave out refunds so...

I mean based on your post history you’ve been flagged for being a Bitcoin Beggar so couldn’t help but notice a pattern forming. If you are in fact helping somehow then thank you. However your post claiming that bitcoin millionaires have more duty to help than a 1 satoshi owner does is illogical and immoral. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:36:20
yes. 1/21,000,000 if it becomes the one true store of value
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:05:16
That’s where you’re wrong. I do believe people should donate their money to help others, but thanks for the assumption anyway. However I vehemently disagree that a rich person has a responsibility to give at a higher percentage than anyone else. If you still disagree then please go read a basic economics book.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:28:51
How about you work harder, put more money into bitcoin, then you donate your money to lightning efforts. Instead of being a Bernie and telling others what to do with their own money
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:50:05
That is a ridiculous Example and it’s oversimplification makes it laughable. If that is what you base your economic principles on then that is sad. First of all 50% for a poor person? 
Next, how did that person get two eggs in the first place? If he was able to get those two then what is stopping him from getting more? Also if he is starving why would his wife not be working?
And for the last time, I think giving is good. I just don’t think forcing someone to give more (percent) because they have more is fair.
I’m done though. I seriously didn’t think what OP said was all that terrible, I still disagree on his logic though.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:58:29
Not exactly, a typical hodl post refers to everyone equally. This OP specifically targeted those with more money, which is an immoral thing to do. They have no more moral responsibility to help than anyone else does.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:28:17
I seriously don’t think you understand what percentages are. All I’m saying is there should be a flat tax rate. That motivates everyone to work harder. If you don’t understand that then let’s quit talking. 
And trust me I understand your POV so no need to explain further. It sounds good in theory and I know you just want to help people. 
Look at these large corporations that are giving bonuses to their employees due to the new tax code. That’s just a small taste of what could happen.
Capitalism will not make everyone rich, it just puts us on a better playing field if we work for it.

a novice investor is the one that put $100 in on Coinbase cause their son told them to at thanksgiving. they arent using GDAX. just using Coinbase app/website takes a week for your money to finish pending. until then, you do not have access to trade your crypto or even send it to another wallet
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:33:04
pay off the debt, bitcoin will continue to rise over the next 5 years barring some worldwide catastrophe or government crackdown. the only thing worse than missing out on some profit is being a financial slave to someone else
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:49:16
nice. any recommendations for how to do this? i'm still relatively new to crypto and wallets and am looking for a good paper wallet. currently on Coinbase now with BTC/ETH/LTC. i like the idea of gifting crypto
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:04:23
I am extremely bullish on bitcoin. i think it will continue to rise and be worth over a million dollars one day. however. this is not a good idea. anything could still happen to bitcoin and crypto in general, and price could drop very suddenly. if so, you are in debt 20 thousand. it is not a smart financial strategy. instead you need to focus on making small gains right now and never spend money you dont have. dont rush it, bitcoin should still be going up over the foreseeable future so you will still make a good profit. up to you though.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:31:17
i understand that. it was a joke. 11 here we come
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:28:53
i like to think it will teach humans to save and only spend this money (which will be worth more in the future rather than less) on things that meet basic human needs OR will truly benefit them. rather than continue the consumerism that America and other first-world countries have been obsessed with over the past century.  we will decide as a species that we can use our money to invest in creating a better future rather than superficial items bought online shopping.
soon time itself will become the most valuable currency. meaning people will spend their money in order to save time...we do this already however will become more conscious of it.

link? i hadnt heard of this. regardless, does that change the value of bitcoin? should it not still be averaged on a global scale?
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:58:37
the only way Coinmarketcap is not correct is if they do not account for volume per exchange. i dont know if they do or not...
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:33:31
but since Bitcoin is a transnational currency, doesnt the average of the global exhange values equate to the true Bitcoin price? not just major western exchanges. if we relate it only to the West, then we are living in just another form of still relying on fiat
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:56:54
but people hold in their own wallets and perform transactions with people that have used other exchanges...making it an average amongst every exchange

Glitch or prophecy?
