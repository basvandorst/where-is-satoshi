That would work. The best solution, though, is solved by making it for everyone so they don't have to worry about extra steps all the time.

Beat my record: 2014 through August 2017. I think  long-hodlers serious about the technology shouldn't even price check; price-checking is bad because you run the risk of making an impulsive trade. Made one of those last December, just got done ponying up 2000$ in taxes for some coins I sold and bought back in under a day. 
Trying to go back to being super passive like that is hard though, but imo it's preferable to riding an emotional roller coaster every day.

Assuming he was a long hodler, who thinks that this was even a good decision? He took 300k in profits in 'the past year', so gains will all be taxed as income, and he missed out on a low interest loan.
He could have waited a year to pay 15% capital gains and paid off the loans and had tens of thousands of more kept for himself.

Bitcoin is bitcoin, bitcoin is not 'turing complete.' You're welcome.

A voluntary trade almost always signify something that is non-zero sum, if there was no gain for participants there would be no reason to trade.

I bet you're on the spectrum.

The one I look at the most is the Aventador, it starts just shy of 500k$. 
My comment was also a joke about how expensive lambos are, though rereading it sounds more literal, should've added the /jk.

I was thinking something similar regarding taxes. If I had received a hundred dollar chair this year, me or noone would even think about paying taxes on it if I sold it for cash, but since I sold a small amount of bitcoin for cash there's no way around reporting it.

 I actually didn't even 
think about the # of people still trying to get in. I thought that coinbase and similar sites had gotten past the problem of trying to validate people and everything.... It really sucks that people have to deal with that crap, it was a big hastle for me when I signed up, can't believe people are still dealing with that same problem months later.

It wasn't too long on here when people were upvoting venezuelian people for thanking bitcoin for saving their families from going destitute. Now we've got a faction of rooting for a centralized alt to succeed started by a dictatorial state actor right after their fiat went up in flames from mismanagement. 
But hey, if we can promote and pump some scamcoin for a quick buck that's all that matters just so long as 'you get yours,' amirite? I miss the days when people here legitimately cared about bitcoin and crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-23 17:51:43
Might I ask you since you're from the area, what's the reaction of the general population to this coin? I thought that Venezuelians had a pretty favorable opinion of bitcoin, given that it was appreciating strongly around the time when the bolivar was going to hell...do people generally like this new idea for a cryptocoin or do they not trust it?
@_date: 2018-02-19 14:14:09
Why is the contrarian view always at the top? You're flat-out wrong yet it gets upvotes. 
Check [this link out]( you can pay in bitcoin for those fancy 4k$ headphones. I got it by adding something to my cart then going to the 'pay with crypto' button.

I read the article but a lot of the material went over my head. How do you practically do these? Is there a website or program?
@_date: 2018-02-22 00:22:08
Is this why most coins are down? People are out to get scammed by yet another shitcoin. :( 
They ran their currency into the dust so might as well run a scamcoin and try again I guess. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 23:55:33
If 'they' manipulated the price at will why isn't it back up at 20k or higher?

I'm legitimately interested on which one he meant now. Did he use uncommon knowledge or did he make a simple mistake? We may never know for sure.
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:28:50
Bitcoin and bitcoin mean different things?
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:22:39
You could probably get a wrecked lambo for 100k...
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:46:07
The price is still around 10k and they're pimping bitcoin on Ellen. What if people just choose to reject crypto, out of ignorance or preference? 
@_date: 2018-02-27 02:03:53
How about we start a big argument over it?

I was in a bad mood last night, I'm sorry for being rude with my prior comment. 
I'm mainly super negative about this coin for philosophical reasons, namely I don't like premining and I really don't like state issuance of crypto. It also seems weird that people would accept this at the exact time that their paper money, a more traditional, trusted system atm, is falling apart. Why would anyone trust them with the other actively falling apart? 
Thank you for your response, I see now that there are actually good reasons to think that this may work.

Probably because he tweets a lot, people complain about getting their feels hurt from his tweets, and people most often talk about current events over past ones.
Just a few, but you have to not be autistic to understand nuances like this so you've got a pass

Are you into this shitcoin, or are you just the typical contrarian redditor that always comes along to play devil's advocate to every opinion anyone ever says?
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:43:45
Shh that was my secret!
@_date: 2018-02-18 16:02:55
I think you're right I was more just voicing a fear that's been in the back of my mind for a while. The price lately hasn't been performing to my imagination's conception of how it should for how many people know about it now, I keep thinking that the price *should* have caught fire by now....need to train myself out of that way of thinking. :(

I thought the movie did a great job at capturing the illogic of addictive thinking. I really liked it!
