Go to localbitcoins . com and find a local vendor.  I have an ATM near me where you can buy bitcoins with cash and send them directly to your wallet.  You pay a premium but it keeps the bank 100% out of it and should give you more peace of mind.

I see your point but I have to disagree.  Less than 20 years ago, nobody in their right mind would enter their credit card online to make a purchase.  Now it's the marketplace of choice for a huge portion of the population.
I was paying for a coffee yesterday and held a $5 bill in my hand.  I was looking at it and all I could think was how archaic it was.  This piece of paper/cloth can fly away, burn up, be ripped, etc etc.  I think your tangibility argument will be turned on its head in the coming years, and bitcoin's lack of tangibility will be part of its appeal.  I truly believe that having to physically possess your currency will soon be a thing of the past.

I think it would be more of a "prohibition" type situation and could actually be very good for the market.  What makes somebody want to do something?  Tell them they can't do it.

What can I do with relatively little computer knowledge? I'm more than willing to help, I've definitely been promoting it by word of mouth.

It's only income if you sell! :)  Hodl and keep adding little by little if you can afford to, down the road you'll be very glad you did.

Considering gold has a market cap of ~7T, and bitcoin is far superior in just about every way...I don't think that's too far fetched at all.

There is literally nothing accurate in this post.

This is definitely true.  It's also currently 7am in China and a lot of people are just waking up, hence the uptick.  They make up the vast majority of the volume and have a huge influence on the market, as does their currency.

I thought the 1.5% buy/sells fees were a bit high but don't have any comparison.  Is it lower anywhere else?

Lol did it?  And DID you have a transferred through a wire transfer, or did they just keep your $3m?

I think that the path and fate of Bitcoin is now in the hands of those who are setting the fees, which, in my opinion, goes against the core principles of Bitcoin.  However, I also recognize that it is an inevitability, as someone has to set the fee amounts.  This probably should have been addressed at Bitcoin's inception and somehow built into the code, but since it was not we find ourselves here.
I would think that it would be most beneficial to miners to see Bitcoin go as mainstream as possible, and process as many transactions as possible.  Especially if a $25k transaction is only going to pay a fee of $3.  
On top of that, if fees remain as they are, you are pricing out a HUGE number of possible transactions, and really pigeonholing the technology.  
It seems to me that fees will dictate whether Bitcoin becomes the new gold, or if it becomes the new cash.  If it becomes cash, the number of transactions will be significantly higher, and everyone wins. The Bitcoin will also keep circulating and keep producing more fees for miners. If it becomes gold, people will be buying and holding.  Which will bring the miner an awesome payday of $3, but likely far less future revenue on those Bitcoins.

You're right, they don't matter if people are transferring tens of thousands of dollars in bitcoin.  But if you want Bitcoin to reach its full potential, where people can buy a cup of coffee, this is obviously going to be quite an obstacle.
A flat % fee seems to be only viable solution, because as of now the options are either A) Same $3 fee for cup of coffee or $25k transfer or B) Same $.08 fee for cup of coffee or $25k transfer.  Neither of which seems attractive.
