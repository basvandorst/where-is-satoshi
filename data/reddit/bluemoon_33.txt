Just get a safe and bolt it to the ground. Keep some in the safe and then put the rest in a safety deposit box at your bank

Really the bottom half should be a GIF of someone refreshing their portfolio app/exchange.

Or worse they get into crypto and then bitch about the price all the time. Especially when they dont really research what there investing in or keep up with it. I honestly just dont bring it up unless something news related( partnerships or Dapps) are announced. 
My friends are the ones that say "crypto is dead/cant believe I got into this" and when its back in green say "knew this would happen/glad I researched this stuff"

I got a couple buddies into one project and since the market crash/pullback have been nonstop with the "crypto is dead and I feel stupid". The project I told them about has had a hell of a few months with new partnerships, ICO news, new Dapps, etc but they only see that the price is still lower than they bought into it. 
They clearly didnt research in depth what they invested in and now feel theres no hope. Worst part is one friend gets most of his crypto news from one of the major media outlets. Articles from CNN/MSNBC/Wall street Journals are normally dumb and basic.

Why would you sell your house for something like bitcoin. Im all for betting on the future but this is very irrational. If you had your house paid off your already financially well off.

I personally think this is true due to the times we live in. Everybody wants quick info, quick gains, and something new. For alot of people the stock market is boring, which compared to crypto it is. The stock market also is a place where low amounts of capital wont change your life financially. Yes you can make money but the stock market doesnt have the potential crypto does in terms of changing your life financially. 
My first financial investment was crypto and I will soon begin investing in stocks. The real reason I got into crypto was its potential gains for being an early adopter. I didnt get into to get lambo in a year or two but more so for the potential financial security that could come if the project/coins I invest in hit like Amazon, google, and apple of the tech/.com era. 
I only invested what I was willing to lose and suggest that for all investments. The stock market is for the slow accumulation of wealth ( yes you can make insane gains if you hit on a stock, which is hard and unlikely). Crypto provides young investors a opportunity of a lifetime and these opportunities dont come often. Yes most coins will fail and alot of people will lose money. But for a small investment you could have massive returns which equal small risk=massive reward.

Yea bitcoins marketcap would be $21 trillion if it was a $1 mill per coin.  Would etheruem be  $50,000+ ? Or Neo $10,000+
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:03:04
So lets say Bitcoin hits $1 million per coin. What the hell do you think the rest of crypto look like price wise per coin like etheruem, Neo, Ltc, etc ?

Guy I follow and learning from has pointed out bitcoins falling in price for weeks and last night. Some of them are good and its not about being right but giving yourself the best odds for it going one way or the other.
