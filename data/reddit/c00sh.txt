What is the winning strategy? How do I justify myself holding right now? We haven't gotten back up yet, competitors have already shown better performances. The supposed savior which is lightning network is actually worse than Dash's master node as it is required for users to deposit the balance first into the channel, which is a bit more costly than the master node and also it creates a privacy problem. 
The past is a poor predictor of the future. Please tell me why should I hold right now besides the moon memes.

Wow, you replied, that feels like I got a mail from a deranged serial killer. You're definitely obsessed with it, you've been doing this for like what, 1.5 year? That's insane. I remember you were fudding in bitfinex subreddit when users were unable to withdraw their BTC, causing a fucking panic, I lost money because of that. Keep on trying you crazy bastard. Now I think you might be right.

How does it feel now that they are about to implode?
@_date: 2018-01-02 05:28:56
Well, then I'd rather sell now than see one before I sell right?

2 weeks ago it hit $20000, now it is down to $13000, I'm a glass half empty kind of guy.

What is ignorant in the figurative sense of the word?

Bitcoin is just people bought a digital asset and then some people for some reason decided to buy it from those people for higher prices. And then some other people buy it for even higher prices. And then some people also decided to buy another digital asset with that digital asset hoping that other people would buy it for higher prices. What a magical phenomena.

What if it goes to $1K for 10 years? He would've saved 70% of his investment and profit potential rather than waiting for 10 years to get back his investment.

Maybe you should sell all your bitcoin so we can moon, you're cursed man.

What kind of present causes this crash? Lambos?

Dude I invested a little money in crypto, now that little money grew to be bigger than my saving, and watching it goes back to "little" money is painful. Doesn't matter whether I need the money or not, it is still money and it is still losing money. Imagine winning lottery today and tomorrow you lose all of the money because you got robbed. Imagine that.

That's exactly the face I made when I saw the red dildos
