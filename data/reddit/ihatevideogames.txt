John Carmack is a legend in the gaming community, he is the co-founder of id software and created such games as DOOM, Quake and more. He is also working close with a new virtual reality technology called Oculus Rift. He's been in front of code from the beginning it seems, so to see him excited for Bitcoin just makes it even better.

pretty much sums it up. haha.

Well it's sad he thinks Mt. Gox IS Bitcoin. I mined $200 BTC the past 2 weeks, how is that a ponzi scheme? :)

I think we're gettin old. :) I remember playing DOOM / DOOM 2 on my 386 with Win 3.1 and DOS and thought it was "Revolutionary" when I could connect to my friends computer via 14.4k modem to play 1v1 deathmatch. Then Quake came out and I said the exact same thing haha!

They have been around since the beginning and have been rock solid from my personal experiences. Just stoked they are finally accepting BTC!

Absolutely, the site is very new, we are considering keeping it very basic and just using embed links from Soundcloud to post the tracks, then we will include artist receive address for donations. Maybe post music we receive on a weekly basis?
We are also thinking about coding a bit more and possibly making it easier for artists to submit music via a form possibly, rather then having to email us and we then manually add it to the site? Definitely want to keep it as simple as possible giving artists their music on the site with a donation link to that artist.
At this time we are definitely up for any and all suggestions, just thought as artists ourselves, this could be a fun way for other artists to connect and hopefully all get some extra donations as well as happy listeners.

All good questions! Not sure about the limit rule with soundcloud, I know that we never upgraded and are still able to upload a certain amount of data, so I would maybe look into it a bit more, you should be able to upload full tracks on there, just with a limited amount of space, I thought it was 2 or 4 gigs? 
We definitely "don't" have to only use Soundcloud links, but Soundcloud was a good start because most artists are on there and its a quick and easy way to listen to music as well as that specific artists gets hits/views on their soundcloud page.
As for embedding the music, Soundcloud has the option for every track to "Share" and when you click share it gives you the option to "Embed" 
ie. --"&lt;iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="
This is the standard embed link that Soundcloud uses, so initially we are thinking this is a quick and easy way to reference artists, and under their embed link we can add their designated Bitcoin donation address. 
I think a site like this will definitely take time to grow, but at the early stages of Bitcoin think it could be a viable time to start a free music site for fans and artists alike to listen and explore new music.
The main objective is really to give artists an easy way to submit music and receive exposure as well as donations if people enjoy that artists music. From the other side, the listener, it's a quick way for viewers to browse the site for new music and find some bitcoin savvy artists.
This idea spawned about a week ago, I've been in the music industry since 2002, I run a small record label and music publishing company and coming from promoting and managing artists, as well as being an artist/producer myself, feel like there really isn't a music site 100% dedicated to just hosting artists original works with an added option for donation. 
Having dealt with iTunes/Amazon and sadly Beatport as a label manager dealing with middle men and so called "distributors" who consistently take advantage of artists, we felt it was the about time to create something simple and easy for artists to use. So it starts off with a fresh site, basic html and hopefully it can grow from there.
The first thing for any serious artist to do is to visit  - signup and register your works with them, Sound Exchange is like a new breed of digital performing rights organization, they will collect royalties for you and do so from youtube players, Pandora/Spotify and I believe Soundcloud as well. 
It's also optional for artists who are even more serious and have national radio plays to signup with Performing Rights Organizations like ASCAP  or BMI, but in my opinion that's only valid if you get music into film/tv and or radio.
At the end of the day, we are artists, we used to upload music to mp3.com back when mp3.com was the real deal. Anyone remember TRANCE CONTROL? I guess our mission is to bring together this new form of technology and connect it directly with the artists involved. 
We are excited and up for any suggestions or tips and hope to make a nice platform for Bitcoin and music to live together.

Having 100% in any one thing is just stupid. It’s great you believe in it but you should diversify in other investment avenues like high yield savings accounts, stocks, bonds, commodities etc.

*plot twist* there’s a priv key that’s linked to 1 whole Bitcoin on the inside wrapping.

Massive congrats man! That’s the dream! Keep it up and Goodluck. :)

Robbed, scammed, seized and used. Sure thing.

Calm down. Circle says that your BTC is insured, so I put a few there. No need to be a fucking asshole about it, just asking about other options to hold BTC besides Circle or coinbase. I heard some things about Airbitz? 
@_date: 2016-12-25 17:35:53
Ok, so I have a few Bitcoins in Circle still because they say it's insured.. what do you recommend for a safe place to store then? Coinbase?
