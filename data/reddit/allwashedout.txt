Touche, doctor! I should have been more specific and said an economics academic. But your credentials do beat mine; I'm only a Master of Engineering ��

Unpopular opinion: Making predictions off chart shapes is noob economics. I've never seen 'charting' taken seriously by an academic or even a hedge fund type. Only by bloggers.
I think it has enough jargon to sound believable but doesn't actually contain any useful information.

Sounds like an opportunity for someone to write a script and put it on GitHub.
I presume you could test on testnet without risking real funds.

To be fair to you, I'm sure 95% of the pushback you get is from people who (incorrectly) think they can time the market. They WOULD probably be better off with a DCA plan.

Be careful about who you recommend it to, and how. It's not applicable to everyone.
DCA solves a specific problem: people who have difficulty buying and holding may benefit from the regime, reducing stress and panic selling.
People who are disciplined at buy-and-hold get no real benefit from DCA. It may even reduce their investment. So they likely see it as amateur advice.

Agreed. An equal amount of CO2 gas is emitted by this scheme. Due to the nature of crypto mining, it doesn't even produce more Bitcoin for the world. The same number will be generated per day either way.
If this became very widespread, the new miners using free-ish power could drive some traditional bitcoin miners out of business. That would be an indirect environmental effect. But unless someone does the math, I doubt there is enough waste gas to power that market shift.

Maybe you've already considered the risks, but I want to give a warning for everyone else.
Buying crypto on margin sounds like a bad idea. BTC is volatile. Buying on margin greatly increases the odds of losing everything or even going into debt.
This advice is coming from someone who is NOT a meek investor. I did &gt;$10 million in automated trades in 2018. Buying on margin is way riskier than that.
