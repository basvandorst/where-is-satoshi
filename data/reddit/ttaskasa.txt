Can one enter the amounts without exposing public keys? (Yes, good sir, go ahead and collect the data on users, we don't have any problems with that :) )

"You are not paranoid if they really are out to get you" and "they" most surely are, so Ill keep doing math in my head. On the other hand, I must compliment you on UI - really smooth ;)

We need to discriminate between facts and opinions. If we are talking US, than it is a fact, that African-american population is over represented in crime, massively. Stating that fact is fundamentally different that calling for genocide. Do you disagree? 


We are all facing that risk. For example, do you know where the word "slave" came to English language from?

The term and idea of "political correctness" comes from totalitarian regimes such as Nazi Germany and Soviet Union, I think r/bitconers are savvy enough to identify garbage concepts ;)

Yes, it seams that consumption of marijuana for both races is equal (why just two, I think you have much more in US than just two. How about asians? Jews? Latinos?), however black people overrepresent themselves in other criminal behavior? And I'm not talking about smoking a joint, I'm talking about murder, rape ant theft. And since that is happening, more resources are dedicated to police such problematic communities, where they then get arrested for other misdemeanors, rather than a guy smoking a joint in his bedroom and not causing any fuss. And this is not "explaining it away", this is understanding reality, not through the lens of "how it should be" or "how I would like it to be", but as it is. 


Actually the harshness of punishment is as follows: white women &lt; black women &lt; white men &lt; black men. So its more of a sexism issue, than racism, and the men get the harsher punishments, racism is secondary here. 


So if you are aware, that slavery was a persistent feature of human civilization, and was finally abolished worldwide with the initiative of Great Briton (and we should be singing praises to them for that singular and unparalleled humanitarian achievement of abolishing institutionalized slavery, among other great things that country has provided to our civilization), could you please acknowledge the suffering of other people, instead of singling out African-americans as sole victims of the atrocity of slavery. 


No they don't. Don't be a drama queen :)

I am not against politeness, that is not the issue. One can be polite and disagree. Political correctness in its principal forces people to lie and internalize the lie, and that is where toxicity comes from. Your approach of addressing the grievances of "oppressed groups" indicates your concern for collectivist causes. They feel good, like you are actually doing something altruistic, fighting the good fight for others, not for your personal gain, however don't forget that the ultimate "oppressed group" is an individual, and it is actually sexist and racist to operate on a "group" level, when you are talking about other people.

Oh and let me remind you, that as a kid, I did participate in an actual non violent revolution, where it was safe, my parents participated in situation where it was not safe, and there were people (one girl stuck in my mind for life) actually crushed underneath the tracks of the tanks fighting for freedom, so I am a little skeptical of your righteousness.

I am not "Randian", I find her in bad taste :) 
But how do you rationalize idea, that generalizing people based on innate characteristics is not prejudicial? What examples of "systemic racism and sexism" can you provide in XXI age western civilization?

As a person who was born in the country under the occupation of totalitarian soviet system, I do not agree that there is anything basic or anything decent in the concept of "political correctness". It is toxic both to an individual and to a society. 
@_date: 2018-05-10 22:05:32


It relates to your support of political correctness, which motivates people to not express their viewpoints and ideas, if they go against the norm. A coherent dialog and honest expression of ideas is the only alternative we have against violence. Limiting the dialog will express the violence - it is a zero sum game in this regard.

If I may, could I ask a noob question?


If I understand correctly, the BTC one purchases are stored in the P2P network, not on the users PC. Is this correct? 
@_date: 2016-11-18 19:16:36
Thanks for clarification. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 17:04:10
OK, but afterwards when transaction is finalized, where does the BTC end up? On a wallet in users PC, or on P2P network?

A douche comes in to a party where metal music is playing and starts complaining about all the noise and head shaking, and possible satanic associations, and that everyone should listen to R&amp;B. 
GTFO with your tone policing, nobody asked you to do it, and it is impolite to impose yourself like this.

That is exactly the time to start learning it. You are now paying for you character flaws: greed and impatience. I presume you are still young. You will get out of this, 10k is not that much. Once you do, you might forget, start rationalizing, how it wasn't your fault (you are already trying to blame the wales). If you don't correct the error in your character, you are bound to repeat these mistakes. It will take other form (not necessary monetary), but you will repeat them.

I actually listen to his economic updates (to see what communists are up to), and if you were to listen to it carefully, you would get more than the nice veneer he is trying to project with "democratic socialism" mask. And I am not flippant here.
@_date: 2019-09-30 17:12:27


And I was born under soviet occupation, so sure, tell me all about "true socialism", how "this time it will be better", and of course "no thugs will take centralized power into their hands". 
I understand that ideas of socialism looks nice on paper, however that is their limit. Travel the world. Go to places where people genuinely believed, they can implement them, look ant the scars that they have left, listen to survivors.

Can a noob as a stupid question? Im starting to buy bitcoin a little every month, at what BTC price it becomes impractical to invest small amounts for long term holding?
PS.: is it worth putting couple bucks per month into LTC too?
