I appreciate the help!
@_date: 2017-03-01 21:06:26
Thanks! I live in a pretty good city, but I appreciate the worries. I will look into that.
@_date: 2017-03-01 01:33:05
Unfortunately, in Brazil, it's not that easy to get a job for teenagers, that's why I want something online.
@_date: 2017-03-01 21:06:36
Thanks! I will look into it.
@_date: 2017-03-01 21:06:52
Awesome! Will definitely check those out!
@_date: 2017-01-04 22:23:34
My dream car! Congrats!

@_date: 2017-01-05 02:00:33
Thank you for that. Would it solve it if I deleted the email?
@_date: 2017-01-04 22:30:04
Thank you for your quick response! :)

Not that significant but quite a lot for a 15 year old; ~88 dollars and a 10 dollar weekly income on Copay. I just sent the email with the seed to myself and a .txt notepad on Win 10. I can fully delete the file with one of that shredding AVG feature, but I have never had any viruses or malware and I am the only one with physical access to my computer. What do you think? Should I make a new wallet, or is it no big deal? 
By the way, yes, it is a gmail account.
@_date: 2016-11-08 21:24:18
Thanks! I think I'm all set with Copay now. Got my link and everything. Thank you once again for the help!
@_date: 2016-11-12 04:15:32
So just keeping it on my virtual wallet?
@_date: 2016-11-08 19:59:38
So that address is a public thing? Interesting. Thanks for the clarification.
@_date: 2016-11-08 20:24:47
Well, it was a suggestion on bitcoin.org, so I thought it could be trusted. Also asked about Wallet options here and on Facebook, and people recommended Electrum. Plus, I watched [this]( tutorial and it does sound pretty simple. Still learning about Bitcoin, but Electrum looks good for a beginner. 
@_date: 2016-11-29 18:04:57
Thank you all for the tips! Will be all considered! :) 
@_date: 2016-11-08 20:09:20
Very nice that they are using technology for a useful thing. Do they also use the Airbitz app, or a more child-friendly one? 
Would I be able to sync the Airbitz app with the Electrum? 
@_date: 2016-11-09 00:08:42
Interesting. As a 15 year old, though, I'm aiming more for a short term investment, but I might consider using 10% of my money or so for long term.
@_date: 2016-11-08 18:18:47
I went to Bitcoin.org and they recommended 6 or so wallets for Windows. Are those all good?
@_date: 2016-11-08 19:00:23
I've heard positive things about Electrum. I think I will try that one first. Have you had any issues with it?
@_date: 2017-01-05 00:47:08
Yep, got that in 3 physical papers, email and notepad. Thanks for the reminder, though!
@_date: 2016-11-08 18:17:43
What's wrong with Windows?
@_date: 2016-11-08 19:53:24
Yes, I do. Running iOS 10. I'll probably do a bit more later on, such as investing and probably keeping a percentage of what I earn in the account. Got familiar with Electrum, so I'll stick with that one for now. Thanks for the help!
@_date: 2016-11-08 21:54:08
I see. Thanks for clarifying that :D 
@_date: 2016-11-08 20:45:13
Yes, I have watched the video and Copay does look way better. Will just get that on my phone. Thank you so much for the help!
@_date: 2016-11-08 20:47:36
Exbu, mind if I PM you for a few other questions I have?
@_date: 2017-01-04 22:26:18
Can someone please help me? I don't understand much of this. I have 83 dollars in Bitcoin on Copay wallet, and nothing else. Am I at risk? What should I do?
@_date: 2017-05-28 20:31:15
I wish I could invest, but I am not allowed to do so at this moment. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 00:25:19
Hey! Yes, it worked. I just put the 12 word phrase, and it transfered everything.
@_date: 2017-06-23 00:50:53
Yes. Read my other comment :) 
@_date: 2017-06-23 03:08:12
Thank you! I will go to sleep in an hour or so. Is it possible for me to set a sale price on DCR right now, considering I will get it in a few hours? 
@_date: 2017-06-23 01:43:23
That's 2AM where I'm located. I think it's going to be worth staying up for a few more hours. I think I'm going to buy 20 dollars of it. What do you think? 
@_date: 2017-06-23 02:29:39
Yes, it does. I just got it today, but I highly recommend it from what I have seen. Developers are active (u/jprichardson), customer support is great, built in exchange system (although fees might be a little high sometimes), nice and simple interface that refreshes coin value constantly, and support for Augur, BTC, Dash, DOge, ETH, Golem, LTC, and tonight, it will probably also have Decred. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 02:31:02
I agree. This coin is still new to me, but I do agree it will grow in the future due to the exposure for more users. I am going to buy 20-30 dollars of DCR tonight. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 01:05:26
Honestly, I am not sure what XRP is. I am just afraid that I could get in trouble for "multiplying" my money. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 01:14:04
I will absolutely do that. Will try to contact them tomorrow morning if nothing changes, and will also try to give them the bug money back. Thank you for the help! 
@_date: 2017-06-23 05:22:47
Will take a look at that. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:08:37
I see. Just using Poloniex for that one trade you helped me do, but after that, I'll only do ShapeShift.
@_date: 2017-06-23 03:05:48
Well, I don't have much money, and I am eager to learn a little if it means I'll be saving some money. I have just put in 30 dollars into Poloniex to buy DCR, and to get used to things. Not sure what I did, but I think my order is going to take some time to close.
@_date: 2017-06-23 01:27:16
I hope they do! I am planning on selling 30% of my BTC to buy other alternative cryptocurrencies. I am definitely going to research more about DCR.
@_date: 2017-06-23 01:20:12
Did not know of this. Thank you. It's scanning now.
@_date: 2017-06-22 23:11:44
Thank you! 
@_date: 2017-06-23 02:23:56
I think I will just get 20 dollars of Decred now on Polinex, leave it in the exchange, and put it in my wallet tomorrow morning. It's probably going to increase a lot after it becomes available on Exodus, right? 
Is there monetary oscillation while it stays in an exchange, or does it stay there with the price I bought it? 
@_date: 2017-06-23 00:55:30
So there's nothing for me to worry about? 
@_date: 2017-06-23 00:03:07
Alright, so there's nothing wrong with sending "money I don't have"? Sorry if it sounds dumb. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 02:41:31
I am not 100% sure of how Poloniex works, as I just got into this, but I have just deposited 30 dollars inth the exchange (still confirming), and will buy Decred with it. Tomorrow morning, when I wake up, I am going to transfer it to my account, because it will be available on Exodus. I will then just hodl it, and wait for the value to hopefully rise. I don't think it would be good for me to place a sell order on DCR at the time, as I believe it has potential to grow a lot, so I will just leave it in my wallet. Do you agree? 
Are there any trading tutorials you have learned from? I'd love to learn more about the Poloniex trading system.
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:09:11
I only have 50 dollars there, in a sell order, but yes, I think I will only use ShapeShift.
@_date: 2017-06-23 00:13:33
I have sent everything I have from Copay to Exodus. It is waiting for confirmation, but this is really weird to look at.
@_date: 2017-06-23 05:22:24
Yeah! It just takes a little time for someone to buy your coins, but besides that, I'm enjoying it! 
@_date: 2017-06-23 02:53:42
That sounds like a smart strategy. I have just put an order to buy 0.59923308 DCR with the 0.01090603 total BTC I have in Polo. I would then pay 0.01819998 BTC for the DCR, and I am in the buy order. Not sure how long it will take, to be honest, but when I am able to buy it, I will put the 0.59923308 DCR to sell for around 0.011996633 BTC (which is 10% more than I sold). Would this be ideal? 
@_date: 2017-06-23 02:10:14
Alright, so I am going to try and make my first transaction on Polinex tomorrow morning. From what I'm looking at the graphs, most of the coins are at a high now. When do I know when it's a good time to buy... or I don't? 
@_date: 2017-06-23 00:50:48
I have done what you recommended, and sent all the money again. I now have doubled the money, and according to BlockCypher, it has more than 6 confirmations, which means it is irreversible, right? I just got money that I did not own. I just wanted to transfer my 370, and now I have almost 900. Who should I talk to? I do not want that money. Could I get in trouble?
