I'm 16 and have been hitting roadblocks for years. If I want to make a bank account I need my passport. If I want to buy Bitcoin I have to fax a file from my parents. Fortunately I made it into a BTC-USD exchange. It's remarkable to see the difference between my friends' comprehension and adults' understanding. My mom may think I am buying weird internet money that I can somehow put on pieces of paper and what is this?
If you want to share BTC, I can help you with that.

If you get mom or dad or *cough* legal guardian to sign stuff, you could try Circle, but that doesn't seem too popular around these parts. But hey, I'm not 18 and I've made a few cents so far with Circle
