That the issue in a lot of places that take bitcoin. Or that the staff use it so rarely they forget about it.

With CVS they will not take a gyft gift card form the phone. You will need to log in on a computer, and print it out. They will take it that way, but they will not give the paper back even if you don't use it all.

When you get to that size just go hunt one of the top 3. Just need to get them close to a green spike, and fire it at them. That will pop them. Letting you get some to all of there mass.

Think this happens only very rarely, and only has happened to me when spam attack are going on. 
This is just a guess, but think the transaction got caught in the payment processor spam filter. Because when it dose happen to me it when it with lower fees that would not get in the next block. Never had it happen when using fee that will get you into the next block. 
Email the payment processor as well they will need to help you.

Don't it too close to the green spikes. It very easy to take out the 1st place player when there passing by them.

Used it at big box stores just tell them it a gift card, and they scan it form the phone very easy. Some time they may have to call the manger over, but that happens whenever you buy a lot using a gift card. Starbucks works great they have a scanner to take gift card form the phone. It made to work with there Starbucks app, but works with gyft or any bar code. If you use it at one of the restaurant they just need the numbers form it. Just say it a gift card they will take down the numbers, and you are good.

Sent a few transactions using a fee of 0.0005 per KB, and it's in the next block. The problem is some wallet are not setting the right fees, or people are just being cheap.

I know a few of the big coin brokers on localbitcoins, and they all told me. That they are getting more female buyers.

Just hope there is no propagation errors just had it happen to me again about hour ago.

That minority is the main difference between a hooker, and a escort or a sugar baby. There still many sites that focus more on escort or a sugar baby then hookers like Backpage. That still can take Visa, Mastercard so on.

Some of the nodes can't keep up now. Some transactions are not being seen. 
@_date: 2016-02-14 06:02:57
Saw it as well. Was thinking maybe i was seeing thing. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 05:59:31
It also looks like some of the nodes can't keep up. Some transactions are not being seen.

Tried at a few Gamestop near me. Will cash out gift card that are low, but was told no to buying other gift cards. Think it has to do with the employee if they will do it or not. If the computer is letting them run it without a override. Do not see why all the employee will not just do it. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 21:13:39
I tried stuff like that before was all ways told gift cards can't buy gift cards. Even at some places that take bitcoin will not let you buy gift cards or lotto with them. You may have gotten lucky, and found one where they do not know that. Hope they do not find out, and stop letting you buy them. 
@_date: 2015-04-09 23:53:06
Had it started doing this to me about 4/6/15. Used it on 4/4/15, and did not have to wait, but that could be just lucky form a fast block. Gamestop will also give the cash back. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 21:02:05
Mainly that when using bitcoin or gyft. The employee is a big factor. Been to many places that take bitcoin. It works great, and fast when the employee know what to do. Other time the employee dose not know at all, and i can't pay in bitcoin. I know this in not a problem with bitcoin itself, but with lack of training. Can't way for more automated ordering systems to start showing up. Can see bitcoin being added in that way a lot easier then the current POS for many places.

Happens with Droid maxx as well, but without the 10 second limit. As long as the Mycellium app is in recent open apps page. Can open it without having to reenter pin.

Do you have a link or a copy of that list? If any are not too far away may go there and buy some gas ones.
