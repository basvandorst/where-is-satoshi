I just hope the two people I told it to who actually had money to invest did so.. one was at $25 the other at $1200 otherwise my 20 years of research was all for waste.. I only became financially feasible about a year ago and even then I didn't have enough between rent and groceries to spend on bitcoin managed to get some but not in time..

Ok I have $500 to spend now how do I do this?

You have your invert axis options settings on that's why.. set it back to default or normal.

Can someone show me how to invest in bitcoin right now.. I might drop in $500 to get my toes wet. Also what's a good bitcoin market price reader or website etc.
@_date: 2017-05-20 23:31:17
I know right. I witnessed it go to $200 from about $25.. and I was like hmm.. damn that crazy return.

Am also interested in your next currency tip pm me your thoughts on the future

Every time I see this.. I go why didn't I buy at 1000.. fml
@_date: 2017-05-21 04:01:13
I will probably wait till it drops back to $500 before I decide to buy. If it doesn't reach that I might Not even try. I just need to know what is the best or safest way to buy and trade bitcoins for now so I can use that knowledge when I am ready. Using probably a visa debit card etc.

I feel like it could go either way.. become a minecraft like sensation and hit it big or fade into obscurity and become a very niche community like most crypto type technologies. Decisions decisions. I might wait till it drops to below $1300 before rebuying in.

So true... the new ethereum ethereum "bitcoin" crypto currency is highly tempting me.. $20 to $130 in only a few months.. I speculate $400 or near around by years end.. that's a triple profit return investment.. very nice and not too bad.

Wow thanks mate.

If I trade bitcoins and make money from it will I have to pay any tax on it like normal investing or capital gains tax? I am from Australia and was just wondering.
@_date: 2017-05-21 04:42:55
If the chart follows previous turns very likely.. I am usually pretty right when it comes to these things especially on high peaks there is usually always a low turn. My question is just how many months or long it will it take.
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:49:35
What's ripple how do i buy it. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 04:03:18
I truly plan to do that.. either 10 years or if it reaches $20000.. $500 at $500 market price.. then save and wait. Better I put the money here imho than lottery tickets.. I have been watching bitcoin for some time now and have been really loving it.

What is the cheapest method for an Australian NSW.
@_date: 2017-05-21 03:44:54
