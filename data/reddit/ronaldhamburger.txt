You have it backwards 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:42:48
Well, yes, of course. That’s why you get in now and then keep a close eye on it. Once all are mined, get out!!
Joking. The difficulty adjusts and, ah forget it. 
Just buy and hodl.

Yup. I’m tired too of the nonsense on the internets.  Need a break.  All will be well if/when I login again.

What is replay protection 
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:52:38
Ridiculous. In a free society one should be able to buy whatever one wants. Any attorneys here that have read the fine print on a credit card application and approval? I’m guessing that the banks have boilerplate language in the agreements that allows them to prohibit the purchase(s) of whatever they want. (In this case out of their fear that crypto will render banks worthless)

Wait. I have btc in my wallet now. If I keep btc there during the fork, do I somehow magically get the other coin as well after the fork?
