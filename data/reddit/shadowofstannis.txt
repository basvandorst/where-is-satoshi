That was never bitcoin's intention. If you read satoshi's original paper on Bitcoin the goal was to provide a currency that did not rely on a third party to confirm transactions. Even looking now, bitcoin is rarely the preferred currency on most dark web sites as it offers little privacy. Cryptos such as Monero are more used as they offer fully private transactions on the blockchain.
