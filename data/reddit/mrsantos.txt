I'd suggest importing the private keys and taking a small amount from each one. This will work as a signal to the owner that someone has the keys.

In Bitcoin you have public keys and private keys. 
The private key is what you use to sign transactions. The public key is, put simply, your account number. Whenever you sign a transaction, your public key is exposed, but your private key must remain secret. So it must be almost impossible to calculate the private key from the public key (else, anyone could find your private key and transfer your money to their account). Yet, it must be easy to calculate the public key from the private key.
There are many ways to generate key pairs (private+public), and one of them is through the use of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). Secp256k1 is an elliptic curve. 
If you're interested in a mathematical description of Elliptic Curves, [here]( is an explanation that is accessible to anyone with almost no math knowledge (i think).

I haven't been keeping up with OB as much as I used to, but my guess is that only the buyer part is accessed through the browser. The sellers still host their own content (mandatory), and the buyers can still use the desktop client (but might as well use their browsers).

Transactions using OP_RETURN are included in the blockchain as any other valid transaction. The difference is OP_RETURN transactions don't result in new data in the UTXO Set.

The other would probably recommend storing paper wallets containing parts of a shared secret (like a 10 of 15 scheme or so) that can be used together to form a private key.

There are lots of implementations like [this]( Some are more tested than others though, and I'm honestly not sure which ones (if any) are standard.

@_date: 2016-03-01 10:31:42
Notice how the low-fee 'oh noes' are paying a normal fee.
It's is reasonable to want Bitcoin to take off and make users pay higher fees for faster transactions iff your transaction still approves in a reasonable amount of time with a normal fee. But what's happening here is completely different. Normal fees mean you may have to wait for 2 hours to get the first conf.
That's not the way to go IMO. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 13:50:41
We'll have to change our pitch talks about Bitcoin to something that doesn't include *paying less fees* then. Either that or we all use a centralized service that transacts off-chain and we remove the *decentralized* part from our pitch talk.
@_date: 2016-03-01 09:29:55


It would, but it's just unnecessary. Blocks are full and it's not like only 1MB of transactions is sent every 10 minutes and the everybody just stops because blocks are full. 
So yes, some transactions are not being confirmed within a reasonable amount of time. I've experienced it, half of the frontpage of has experienced it, and I'm not sure why you'd nee da proof. Send a few Satoshis to yourself and see it with your own eyes if you need a proof.

Except his post suggests something that'd work against BU too. It's just a generic attack. It's about time we let go of this kind of *ad hominem* and start worrying about bitcoin. I mean, were is the "bitcoin is regulated by mathematics" thing after all?  If the protocol allows it, we should just live with it and move on. There is no right or wrong in the blockchain; only consensus. 
The protocol does not allow BU, but it does allows block withholding attacks. This is exactly what Gavin is talking about. He's not even proposing something new.

To be pedantic, it doesn't get *sent* back. It never leaves until it is included in a block. Your wallet may indicate that the BTC was *sent*, but if it's not included in the main chain, the private key(s) in said wallet are still able to spend them.

It really depends on the wallet. Depends on how frequently blockchain information is fetched from a trusted server (in the case of a mobile wallet, at least). Anyway, it should be possible to force the wallet to refresh. If it's just not working, export the private keys and import them to a better wallet. ^(Be careful handling private keys though.)

@_date: 2016-06-20 11:39:17
I see two reasons:
1) Some wallet software is still not responding to fee changes dynamically. So people send legit transactions that have a low fee because the wallet software handles it transparently with a low fee. 
2) Some people attack the network by spamming mempools with spammy transactions. These transactions have a low fee so that they will stay in the mempool for as much time as possible.   
@_date: 2016-06-06 12:47:35
The halving is public knowledge, so wouldn't the price adjust organically before the halving? The price has doubled in the past ~10 months, I always assumed it was the market adapting to the eminent halving of the supply. 
Following this (possibly flawed) logic, the actual halving would not have any significant impact on the price because the market had already adjusted. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:52:55
The change would be gradual, and voted for like in CSV. 
It's been tried in Clssic, but it failed due to, IMO, the core team not publicly supporting the change.

I had never realized the use of "anyone can spend transactions" and a separate merkle tree for segwit, along with using the coinbase transaction to store the merkle root of the witness data to the coinbase parameter. Pretty neat. 
That raises a **question** though: what's keeping a miner from issuing a block with a segwit transaction, but not including its witness data? I mean, it certainly invalidates the block, otherwise segwit would be pretty silly. But I don't understand how. Wouldn't it just make that an "anyone can spend" transaction? Do segwit tagged blocks still allow "anyone can spend" transactions? 
@_date: 2016-06-12 12:40:43

@_date: 2016-12-08 09:53:04
But when would I lose the ability to verify the past? If the last "reference block" is verified, and all blocks on top of it are verified as well, wouldn't that be enough to verify the new "reference block"? Or am I missing something here? 


I feel the same. It's increasingly difficult to find genuine discussions around here. Thanks! 
@_date: 2016-12-08 17:08:40


Enough hashpower is built on top of it. If enough blocks were mined on top of the block that has the merkle root of the UTXO set in the coinbase parameter, then you may assume it's safe. When you turn on your node after being offline for a while, you trust the longest chain. This is no different.  Consensus rules would need to be made stricter to guarantee that such block with an invalid merkle root would not be accepted in the blockchain. Each block built on top of that Nth block would then work as a confirmation. 
The full history can be verified. Say we're at block 500000 when this is implemented.
1) The "reference block" is created independently in each node. 
2) The merkle root of the UTXO set is inserted in  block 500001 by a miner.
3) The block is accepted in the mainchain if it's valid.
4) From that point on, once there are enough confirmations, one can disregard all the data in the blockchain before that point.
5) Once, say, 50000 new blocks were built on top of it, the process is repeated. The transactions included in the new UTXO set will be the unspent transactions in the previous UTXO set plus all new unspent transactions. Notice that at this point we're not blindly trusting a random UTXO set, but one with thousands of confirmations on top of it. 
 
Bear in mind that during your IBD you may decide to not trust the latest "reference block" and choose to trust only the second or third last (as long as there are still nodes that contain that history).

This has the advantage of accelerating Initial Block Download.
With pruning, you have to download all the blocks in the blockchain, and you discard the transactions that don't contain UTXO. The only way to accelerate it (at least the only way I can imagine) is to have some kind of agreed upon structure containing the UTXOs, which IBD would download along with the blocks mined since the last "reference block" was built. 
This thing would allow a tremendous amount of hashpower to confirm the "agreed upon database of UTXO's", thus making it safe to agree on it. 
IBD then becomes a process that doesn't require an ever-growing amount of bandwidth.
Again, I'm not claiming this is some kind of magic solution to all scalability problems. I'm just trying to understand the security implications of this.

This is a completely different scenario though. In the case you mentioned, those miners aren't *essential*, in the sense that we don't need them to continue mining blocks, so the transactions will still be included in someone other miners' blocks.
In this case though, we do need big blockers' *hashrate* to approve SegWit. Unless, of course, their miners start switching to other pools which are signaling for SegWit. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 21:55:36
Here is my bold prediction:
Few people oppose SegWit per se. For the most part, those who aren't signaling are just part of the big block crew. I believe they are trying to use their hashrate (which is currently well above the 5% they need to block SegWit) to corner the Core team and make them compromise. I can see them announcing something like "We'll signal for SegWit iff blocksize is increased to 2MB". 
In fact I don't see a reason why they would do something else, given that they stand for bigger blocks and have enough hashrate to make this move. 
Am I missing something? Would this be impossible/infeasible for some reason? 
@_date: 2016-11-28 17:02:23
That's tricky. ~~As far as I know, unless you're solo mining, you don't chose the transactions you're accepting. The pool does it for you.~~
That depends, of course, in the mining protocol used between the pool and the miner.
I did some digging, and it looks like what I said before wasn't entirely correct. 
I believe the first protocols for pooled mining (see *getwork*) don't allow this, but the latest ones do (see *getblocktemplate* and *stratum*).

We're getting into a very pedantic and irrelevant argument, but SegWit does **not** make blocks bigger. SegWit just makes more transactions fit into a block. That's an *effective block size increase*. The problem is that it is only beneficial if people are using SegWit transactions (which will probably happen shortly after SegWit is enabled, but still...) You can't really say it's a block size increase, because it isn't. You still have 1MB. 
@_date: 2016-12-15 15:52:03
I'd really like to know how you got the impression that I support a "SegWit-like-but-not-SegWit" thing. Jeez, it looks like everything said in this sub is a target of abusive interpretation. 
I support SegWit. I also think a non-SegWit blocksize increase may be necessary, after SegWit. SegWit should be the priority right now, IMO.

Could you expand a bit on this? I though lightweight wallets wouldn't be affected, since their trusted nodes would still have the UTXO set regardless of the pruning. 
@_date: 2016-12-17 20:01:49
If you can't find it in a block explorer, it never hit the blockchain. And 6 months is more than enough for the transaction to drop out of the nodes' mempools. So if I understand the situation correctly, what you need to do is get that key, import it to another wallet (or resync your wallet) and see your BTC show up again in your balance. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 14:28:51
You wouldn't be trusting miners though. You would verify the "reference block" by checking the merkle root of the transactions in your UTXO and comparing that with the hash included in the coinbase parameter of the Nth block. 
Such block would only be validated by the network if the hashes matched. 
Once enough hashpower was built on top of that "reference block", you could decide to trust the "reference block". 
That would not require trust in miners, as far as I can tell.

See [this]( post and [this]( thread of comments for an in-depth discussion. This should be a good overview of how the system would work. 
Starting next January, I'll start working on an implementation to do exactly this. It has all the advantages of pruning, and doesn't have the disadvantage of making Initial Block Download impossible. It's fully backwards compatible. 
I'd like to get as much feedback on it as possible. Feel free to drop your comment here or in the post.

@_date: 2016-12-13 12:27:51
Interesting, though I'm skeptical whenever the concept of "balances" is involved. You could look at it from an UTXO perspective. 
I proposed a solution not long ago that accomplishes basically the same, but:
**1)** Doesn't require miners to stop hashing
**2)** Is fully backwards compatible and doesn't require a hardfork.
**3)** Doesn't require trust in the miners the same way your solution would.
The key idea is to freeze the current UTXO set in something called a "reference block" which contains a list of all transactions that currently lead to a UTXO. This UTXO is hashed in a merkle tree, and the root is included in the coinbase parameter of a block. From then on, nodes would only relay blocks that have the merkle root of the valid UTXO set in them (or no merkle root at all). Thus, rules for block validation are made stricter (and since miners only build blocks on top of valid blocks, each mined block serves as a confirmation of the valid UTXO set. New nodes could simply download a sufficiently verified UTXO set and the set of blocks mined after that. This is an advantage relative to pruning since with pruning, new nodes still need to download all transactions. 
I don't think this holds a security threat, since once a "reference block" has enough confirmations (say, 10000-50000), it's perfectly fine to trust the corresponding UTXO set.  
Read more on it [here]( and in [this]( discussion, and share your thoughts.

Does the cost come from fees, or increased prices?
@_date: 2016-12-09 15:41:42


I actually disagree here, because I'm not talking about the same "reference block" or UTXO set. An UTXO set is valid if the previous "reference block" confirms so, and the **next** "reference block" is valid if the merkle root in the coinbase parameter matches the "reference block". It's not circular, it's a "time-line", not a circular reference. Much like the blockchain itself.
Even if your node was offline for a while, you still know which chain has the biggest amount of PoW. Actually, something is missing in the original design of the "reference block" thing. I believe a *cummulative difficulty* parameter should be added so that a node can figure out which is the longest chain. So the content in the coinbase parameter should be something along the lines of sha256("merkle root of UTXO set" + "cumulative difficulty"). Would you agree that this way a node could figure out what the longest chain was? Again, a chain would only be built on top of this hash matched the expected results, so a miner couldn't just create block with a higher "cumulative difficulty". I may be a bit fuzzy on the details of how the "cumulative difficulty" is used to determine the strongest chain, but I believe it's something along these lines.


True. You could argue the same about pruning. Though with pruning you still verify the whole chain. I would argue that with this system, the network takes the responsibility of doing that "on the go". You need to trust the whole network, not individual players. And yes, it definitely increases the likeliness the chances of a 51% attack. Would it be a realistic risk though? I'd argue it depends on how often "reference blocks" are issued. If the chain on top of a reference block has *enough* PoW on it, it's hardly an issue. 




But would it be realistically to consider this kind of scenario in a 10000+ block time-frame? I care about remote theoretical attacks, but this would require **tremendous** hash power to execute.
@_date: 2016-12-18 09:05:55
They should show immediately. Are you 100% sure you're using the right key?  
@_date: 2016-12-13 12:31:06
If all nodes are running pruned mode, then Initial Block Download is impossible, thus, in the current configuration, it's impossible to launch new nodes if everybody is pruning. Which is not really something to worry about IMO.
[Here]( is a solution to that problem based solely on the UTXO set. Let me know your thoughts on it.
@_date: 2016-12-04 14:55:16
@_date: 2016-12-08 18:08:27


Excuse my poor wording, I should have referred to the chain with the most hashing power behind it. But in any case, any case, you don't lose the ability verify the transactions after the "reference block". Assuming, of course, the contents of the UTXO set can't be tampered with, which I still believe it's true, since:


The rule stating that blocks are only valid if they contain a merkle root of a valid UTXO set. If the were tampered with, they won't go into the chain. From that point on, if the chain is being built on top of that block, you can assume that UTXO set was valid. 


Not trusting the most recent reference block would only mean downloading an older one, only to download the history of blocks after that point and hopefully find out the most recent reference block was valid after all. 


We're only removing the ability to verify the irrelevant part of the history - the one that doesn't currently lead to a spendable output. 


Yes, the advantage of this solution when compared to pruning would be to speed up IDB. It's arguably a security compromise, you're right, but I would be willing to trust a UTXO set that was confirmed 10000 times.


Should be interesting. Let me know if you do something with this! 
I feel like I'm missing a point here. What would an attack to this system look like?
@_date: 2016-12-04 08:18:22

Not too long ago, you even talked about a blocksize *decrease*.

Thanks for the link. I didn't know of this proposal. 
It's interesting, though it requires a degree of centralization. IMO, the proposal being discussed there is superior in the sense that it does not require IBD to trust a set of developers. 
On the other hand, the solution they propose is much easier to achieve. Maybe that could be used as a stepping stone towards the solution I propose. 
@_date: 2016-12-10 10:55:07


Learned a new expression today! ;) You are right, it is a "turtles all the way down" argument, much like the blockchain itself. Except with the blockchain, you can say the last turtle is standing on solid ground, while in this configuration you can only say "well, it must me standing on solid ground since every other turtle seems to be doing quite well". 
I want the iron clad security in Bitcoin as well. Scaling just happens to bug my mind a lot though, and I'm starting to believe a "good enough" solution is better than no solution (regarding the ever-growing size of the blockchain). 
BTW, do you see any reason why this solution couldn't be implemented as a softfork, hypothetically? It looks to me as consensus rules only become tighter, making it backwards compatible, but I may be missing something. 
@_date: 2016-12-06 22:47:34
There are currently about 43 million transactions in the UTXO set. Computing the merkle tree of those transactions takes about twice that number of hashes. 
Let's say it takes 100 million hashes. Current mining hardware is working at  4,000,000 Mhash/s. So all of that would take about 2.5x10^(-5) s.
Of course full nodes would also need to do this, which would take much longer (about 1 minute).
Notice that N here should be a fairly large number. If N is 52000, we'll do this about once a year. Not a big deal, I believe.
@_date: 2016-12-04 10:13:53




I did. That was always a super controversial hardfork though. IMO, a segwit + 2MB HF thing would be widely regarded as a good solution, and miners would adopt it. 
Though I agree this is a huge risk and shouldn't be adopted without a great deal of discussion.

Thanks for reading through.


The problem I see with pruning is that to run a node in pruning mode, you still have to download the whole blockchain. You simply discard everything that isn't  relevant, like transactions that were already spent. With this method, a new node can simply use a "reference block" that has enough confirmations and download the blocks from that point onwards, disregarding everything that comes before. The UTXO set in the reference block effectively compresses all relevant information prior to the point in which it was created.

AFAIK, SPV implementations need to query some node about transactions received to ensure validity. Having an _authenticated_ UTXO set would eliminate that need and increase privacy while decreasing bandwidth needs and decreasing the time to set up a node. 
I remember talkig to a core dev on IRC about this and getting an answer like "I can see us moving towards some kind of solution like this in the future". 
I see this as having the benefits of SPV with none of the drawbacks.
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:34:04
It would be interesting to see some kind of trustless solution to get the nth block's hash instead of trusting a hardcoded hash in the wallet's source code. 
Also, unless I am missing something, downloading the blockchain from a certain point onwards makes it impossible to know the UTXO set.
[Here]( and [here]( are threads in which this topic was discussed at length. The solution proposed is based on freezing the UTXO set through inserting its merkle root in a block's coinbase transaction. 
@_date: 2017-04-27 01:23:36
Don't know if it checks out, but it certainly doesn't bloat the UTXO set ^(I'm so sorry)

Wanna know a cool soft-fork trick to avoid miner pooling? 
Make a new rule that forces blocks to include a signature of  "nonce+merkle root of coinbase transaction addresses" with the private key that corresponds to the address in the coinbase transaction. This signature would be included in the coinbase parameter. 
It would not be feasible for the centralized service to calculate new signatures for each nonce, and since it can't just give the private keys away, this would result in pooled mining being unfeasible.

As far as I know, yes. I meant incoming transactions. 


I gave that a lot of thought in the past year. Hopefully, this isn't complete nonsense :) A first, simple approach would be a softfork where _the majority_ agrees to only accept block number N (in the future) if it contains the correct merkle root of the UTXO set at the time (in the coinbase parameter). This is, as far as I can tell, extremely easy to implement in a softfork. After some number of blocks was mined on top of this block, it would be safe to never use the full blockchain again. Block download could start from there, because that would have a lot of hash power to back it up. Along with a "reduced" blockchain, the UTXO set could also be downloaded (and trusted if the merkle root matches).
But I don't like the idea of doing this just once as described above -- it only happens once. It would be interesting to have a rule in the block validation module that only accepts every Nth block if it contains a valid merkle root of the UTXO set. 
Do let me know if you find a problem with this reasoning. 
 &gt; There is an additional drawback, though: waiting to sync blocks every time you turn on your wallet is not fun.
True! For a node in my laptop it would be very practical. But for mobile.. not so much.

At that point, they are separate blockchains. 
(I'm fairly certain of the following, but please correct me if I'm wrong)
The problem then is most transactions are valid in the context of most chains (even if one of them implements SW, since SW transactions look like "anybody can spend this output" transactions for nodes that don't implement SW). 
If, say, BU HFs away and includes a block that is invalid in the core chain, something interesting happens. When you spend your BTC, it has to be mined into both chains (included in a block in each chain). From that point on, you have BTC in both chains and it works just like a different coin. 
See ETH and ETC, for instance. ETC forked away, and now there are two coins that you can exchange for each other (even though AFAIK, ETC is dying).
You can exchange them for each other just like any other coins.

Assuming OP has what it takes to do that (the "plaintext" of the transaction), this is the easiest solution.
Anyway, OP, the money is not lost if you still own the private key. The transaction has certainly been dropped by most nodes' mempools by now, so what you need to do is either:
1) Push the transaction as said
2) Create a new transaction to spend those same inputs.
It may happen that your wallet is currently not showing those inputs in your balance, but if you still own the private key, you still own the BTC.
I would suggest re-importing the private key into your wallet, or importing it into a different wallet. This way the wallet re-scans the blockchain (or probes a service that does it) to see how much your address has instead of using the cached values.

That is **not** correct.
Deriving the public key from the private key is trivial. The opposite is close to impossible, but private-&gt;public is what you do when you generate a new key pair: you generate the private and from the private you generate the public... and then you generate the address by hashing the public key in a certain way.

The guy builds an empire (shady af, but still an empire) and does not encrypt his private keys?

~~My thought on that, assuming the alternative implementation respects the consensus rules, is that it massively improves resiliency.~~
~~As an example, imagine one day someone discovers a bug that allows remote halting of core nodes (Remember a few months ago when some 80% of Bitcoin Classic nodes were taken down in a matter of minutes? Fun times!). Since almost all nodes are running the same implementation, this same exploit can be used to shut down a great part of the network. But if, say, half of the nodes are running other implementation, the exploit will (probably) not work in the alternative implementation.~~

Interesting question. QR codes have redundancy, so seeing a fraction f of the QR code gives you more than that fraction of the bits of the key.
I believe the maths in the top answer is wrong. If you know 7/8 of the bits, the search space goes down to 2^(160*(1-7/8)) ~ 2^(20). This is in the order of 10^(6), which is easily achieved even by a shitty laptop.
I don't know which fraction of the qr code is readable from this picture and which fraction of the total key is thus exposed, but 7/8 sounds like a stretch.

The miner who issues the next block wants to  mine that block in top of a valid chain. So when the next block is mined, it means the miner also verified the previous block, thus, it's a confirmation.
So the number of confirmations of a transaction in block  *i* is *current_height - i + 1*.
The *+1* is the first confirmation, the rest is the following confirmations caused by the blocks issued after that.

Kind of playing the devil's advocate here, but it's not like decreasing the node count would be an immediate consequence of blocksize increase. The storage requirements would increase more rapidly over time, but it's not an abrupt change. 
Bandwidth usage would not be higher than it would be with SegWit (which I support, BTW) since signature data has to be transmitted anyway. The load on the RAM would decrease, since the mempool would become smaller. Transaction fees would decrease, transactions would be confirmed faster. At this point, the congestion on the network is hard to bear, honestly. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:30:30


You can't _fake_ a transaction. A transaction with a fake signature simply does not propagate through the network. What you _can_ do is either:
1) Try to issue a conflicting transaction (one that spends a set of outputs that intersects with the set of inputs in the original transaction) which is unlikely to work even at 0-conf since nodes will typically not propagate both, afaik
2) Pay a fee so low that the nodes will eventually forget about the transaction before it gets inserted into a block. This way, it is as if the transaction did not exist. But the receiver still sees the transaction at 0-conf. The receiver may re-broadcast the transaction at a later time, when the average fee is lower (that is, if the attacker hasn't spent the output already as in 1))

Not sure if trolling, but the answer is no.
The increase does not come from the halving itself, but from the incorporation of SegWit. SegWit removes the witnesses from the blocks. With the witness removed from the blocks, effective block size increases.

There is the concept of Bitcoin-days destroyed. If you've received 2 BTC from a transaction 3 days ago and you spend it, you destroy 3x2=6 Bitcoin-days. It's a way to measure "volume". It's a good measure, because if I just send bitcoin back and forth, it won't count as true "volume".

Bitcoins aren't on the blockchain. Bitcoins don't... *exist*.
Your wallet just tracks unspent transaction outputs (UTxO), commonly referred to as *bitcoins*. To spend  UTxO, you use your private key to sign your consent to spending some amount. 
With hardware wallets, your private key never sees the outside world. Typically, hardware wallets only sign the transactions, but never reveal the private key inside it. It your private key never sees the outside, nobody can steal your private key. If you have your keys stored in, say, your phone, they are much more exposed than in hw wallets. That's why it's much safer to keep them in a hardware wallet.

Sometimes the blocks are almost full for a couple of hours, but the come back to normal after a while. 
A good way to look at it is to see the size of the mem pool.

Assuming the block size is enough the do that, and assuming 500 bytes per transaction, 20 million transactions would take 500x20x10^6 bytes, which is 10 Gigabytes in every node.

Sorry to bug you again. The more I think about this, the more confused I am. 
Let's say only 40% of the miners approve OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY. Doesn't that mean that the network will eventually fork? Because blocks mined by those 40% would contain transactions that have OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY, which is not known to the other 60%.

It all depends on the level of safety you want, and what you want to use the coins for.
If you use your coins often, you'll probably need to have a fraction of your coins in a wallet on your phone or something. 
The rest of the coins should be, i'd suggest, in cold storage. What kind of cold storage you use is up to you. 
For me, it's enough to use a paper wallet in a secure location (as I have a small amount anyway). For bigger amounts, I'd suggest using a hardware wallet such as Trezor. 
You can learn about hardware wallets online, it's really cool if you're into that kind of stuff. 
The advantage is that nobody can extract the keys from the wallet even if they have the wallet. 
(For even more security,  a multisig scheme should do the job, but I must warn you that as far as I know it's a pain to do so.)
