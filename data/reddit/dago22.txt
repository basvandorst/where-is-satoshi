HODL it
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:46:52
Something big, as in thousands are panicking like OP is.
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:36:42
I would wait and see the effect the tings i have mentioned will have on the price.
But ithat´s just me.
My advice to you would be, think carefully before making a decision, you now have some facts you likelly did not have before, so use those facts to make a decision you will be comfortable with.

Thank you for the reply
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:29:40
No one can predict the efect that it will  have.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:22:14
Ah, that explains it.
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:26:42
So, just download, uninstall old version and install the new one?
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:47:23
I thought it was just going to be just test
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:07:14
I thought that was so small it didn´t really qualify as a dip.
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:26:28
Well, do doy plan to HDL or will you sell later?
If you plan to HODL it really doesn´t matter if you buy at a ATH, because BTC will rirse much higher later.
But if  you don´t plan to HODL long term just wait, BTC tends to be very volatile so, so, it will fall sooner or later, maybe to the 7600 range.
No one knows for sure though, i´m just speculating here.
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:16:32
I would wait.
But there are people that say the Bitcoin Futures thing will make it shot up even higher.
Even though it´s just a test AFAIK
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:43:50
The price has been like that since yesterday.
What makes you so sure it has started falling an it´s not a continuation of Bitcoin´s state so far?
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:10:53
I thoughgt that one of the requisites for any ponzi is that the investors can´t withdraw their money for a set time.
Was i wrong?
I mean if it is like that then Bitcoin it´s not a ponzi just because you can sell whenever you want.
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:05:13
Is this a HYIP?
If it is, all HYIPs are scams.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:22:13
Ugh no, it´s such an awful show
I´ll wait for someone else to recap it.
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:01:17
Why does people in this sub make such a fus of Bitcoin going back a few hundred dollars?
And it´s not as if it was a constant loss of value, the coin has been stuck around the 7600-7800 range for hours now.
I don´t get it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:18:09
Is this really a crash? I´m not seeing a massive drop yet.
I see it pretty stable now actually.
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:52:18
I´m new with all this, how do i upgrade it?
@_date: 2017-09-22 16:53:22
I´m pretty new at this, but, isn´t bitcoin mining pretty much impossible for PCs now?
Or how is this suppossed to work exactly?
@_date: 2017-09-22 16:44:47
There is literally nothing free in this world.
So, i wonder, what´s the catch, scheme or fraud with this...
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:20:55
Better buy directly otherwise yo´ll lose money due to constant increase of bitcoin mining difficulty and fees from the cloud mining sites
Do not buy cloud mining contracts, unless you want to lose money

It seems like Bitcoin gets banned then unbanned and banned again in China every 5 minutes here
lol
