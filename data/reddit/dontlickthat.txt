2 weeks? No, it'll likely be months, unfortunately.

If you do that you'll have an IRS (or EU equivalent) target on your back for the rest of your life.

This has nothing to do with Bitcoin. This is just general investment advice.

Buy as many as you're comfortable losing and don't spend them unless you need to.

How much? I've got .00something BTC in mine that I expect to never see again.

This site is a scam. Don't trust it.

Lies. The site is a scam. I can post proof if needed.

But did you ever get your money? It's a scam.

In that case,  if I give you my trade number will you complete my transaction that is still "pending"? It appears that BTCindia.org stole my BTC. It looks like a scam,  but I'll retract my allegation if you complete my transaction.

This is a scam. Don't trust btcIndia.org

Are the required to give out BCH? It's not a stock split.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:32:25
Will this split?

Also note that the cops done have to know the laws either. They just arrest you and figure out if you're doing anything illegal later with no recourse.

The legal thing isn't always the right thing. If it's their money (and the spouse had no part in making it) then giving them half would be wrong. Of course lying and hiding the money is probably a horrible mistake and you'll likely get caught.

Just because it's a shitty financial decision, doesn't mean  supercars are shit engineering.

FYI- I used BitInstant to buy bitcoin quickly. I read the article on Forbes, and 30 minutes later I had bitcoin in my newly created Mt.Gox account. It really is that quick. I had an account deposit email waiting for me when I got back from depositing cash at the local Walmart. I had to pay a 2.5% fee, but that was much better than losing value while waiting to be verified.

That's right, because "Prove me wrong!" is a great way to start a debate.  What can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence. The government will probably take notice that they're loosing power over the way people buy and sell, but that could be a long way off.
