That's true. Ah well. Anywho, I'll just wait patiently. It's all just for a bit of fun anyways.

My brain entertained the idea of putting out a sign at my garage sale that says "I accept bitoins"
@_date: 2013-04-19 00:14:35
I agree with him on the point that bitoin is hard to trade for goods right now due to its rapidly changing prices. But looking at the previous year's charts for bitcoin prices, it's pretty stable in the long run. Not only that, but the more bitcoins there are and the more adopters there are, the less power will be in each traders hands. So I think bitcoin has a lot of potential in a failing economy.

Eh, just for getting into it. I also have dwolla, but have no money in it. So  paypal would help get started quicker. Anywho.

You guys are doing 's work
In all honesty I really wish I could dive in and help with this somehow, I am a computer science major, but I hate web design (I do sort of enjoy back end stuff) but I really don't have time :/
@_date: 2013-06-03 00:09:48
May I ask how much that generates? I know cpu mining is terrible, but I've wondered about the actual numbers.
@_date: 2013-04-18 01:21:35
Think about it though, in 5 days you'll have .2 BTC, then after that it will only take 2.5 days to have .3 BTC (assuming you keep a consistent profit percent) then after that it will take ~1 day to hit .4 and so on :)
@_date: 2013-04-18 00:35:21
And here I am, without any funding to buy some bitcoins. Have to wait to verify my dwolla account :P
@_date: 2013-04-19 00:12:00
Not to mention the convenience of bitcoin in a digital age is pretty damn impressive as well. Could be better, but hey, she's young.
@_date: 2013-04-19 15:18:02
An easier fix for this would just be to have more people using bitcoins. I mean the more people holding bitcoins the more people accepting them, the more people willing to spend them, the less power individual traders have, and of course the more stable the price. I believe more people will come relatively soon. Bitcoin is getting a lot of exposure and there's new people getting into bitcoin every day. If something were to spike then I'd say we'd be in a pretty good place.

Bitcoin trading is pretty similar to stock trading. I would read up on stock trading then search similarities and differences. Just google "Bitcoin trading tips" to get some basic help. I'm sure there's others that could help more, but understanding how stock markets work will help out quite a bit.
@_date: 2013-05-01 21:11:38
I'm on  right now. These stickers would be awesome :)
@_date: 2013-04-19 14:50:37
Thank you. I just don't see the point of having bitcoins if you aren't going to utilize them as a currency. I want more websites to adopt the ability to receive funds in bitcoin and I think the idea of an internet currency is a great idea. It can work worldwide, essentially making the internet like an independent body apart from governments and corporations :) I've actually been toying with ideas for an extension for browsers and a plugin for websites for easily transferring bitcoins for donations or tips or what have you.
@_date: 2013-04-18 02:47:23
God damnit...
@_date: 2013-04-18 00:57:55
First of all, don't bitcoin drunk ;)
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:29:31
I'm wondering if this isn't the way we should be doing it. I think I'd rather buy straight from a bitcoin user than go through another bank service. Then I could use paypal and no one would give a shit.
@_date: 2013-04-17 15:23:56
Don't ask me man. I comment religiously these days. I have a habit of not wanting to reread my code, and it gets me in trouble. Others also find it quite helpful. It's really a lot less effort than constantly rereading code. I'm sorry you got one of the more annoying previous coders lol
@_date: 2013-04-19 00:48:13
I may be interested. Depending on how much you want for the BTC.
Edit: To clarify on my willingness, I'm waiting for my verification fees to go through with dwolla, so I can't get bitcoins. I'd be greatfull for a chance to get started.
@_date: 2013-04-19 00:50:00
That's my thinking. I want that bitcoin before I send off the money. Seeing as how he made the offer, I think that's fair.
@_date: 2013-04-19 16:28:21
That's quite true. But in time, there will be more bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-17 19:28:22
I'm thinking a web browser extension and a plugin for websites that could easily interact. I honestly don't think it would be that difficult.
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:54:21
That's what I was going for. Anything else you can think of that would be beneficial? Perhaps have it send payment as an email, that way you can leave a message? 
@_date: 2013-04-17 15:11:23
We're also quite lazy...
@_date: 2013-06-03 00:22:54
That's quite a bit better than I thought. Thanks for the info.
I'd BTC tip you, but I'm bitbroke
@_date: 2013-04-19 14:41:39
That's actually quite interesting. Sadly there aren't too many people that are local. I could buy in Kentucky as I'm going next weekend. That's still 5 hours away though... But these prices are a bit high for my taste.
@_date: 2013-04-17 20:10:53
That can be spoofed, but still a damn good idea.
@_date: 2013-06-03 00:10:05
I really like this design :) Elegant
@_date: 2013-04-18 00:58:50
Yeah, when I have to give a website my SSN and answer questions about my stepmother, it's a little bit worrying...
@_date: 2013-04-18 00:41:16
I would contact them about it. I'm sure they're flooded right now, but this seems like an important case that they would help with. I wish you luck my friend, this is a shitty situation.
@_date: 2013-04-18 01:15:35
Alright man sounds good :) I work in IT, attend college, may soon have a second part time job doing more IT, am planning on moving in with my girlfiend soon, and have a stepmother pregnant with twins who's due next month lol. But my current partner I'm working with for an occulus rift demo has disappeared, so may have a bit of free time ;)
@_date: 2013-04-17 20:40:29
Oh lol. That went over my head.
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:39:25
Is it just me or did the way he did the arrows make it a bit confusing? Maybe I'm just too sleep deprived...
@_date: 2013-04-19 14:44:51
Ah, thank you :)
@_date: 2013-08-28 18:12:35
Sounds about right. But the size of BTC use is the reason one large transaction affects the market so much.
