Dude, the whole point of an offline computer is to make sure it is safe and uncontaminated. You'll ruin it if you install games, or do anything not related to cold storage on it. Do something cheaper like paper wallets if you think it is too expensive.

There's a thing called digital signatures. It is based on cryptography, not a scan of your hand written signature. It's been around for decades, and it is even built into the PDF file format.

You know fully well all bitcoin transactions are public. If you're looking for an fully anonymous money transfer tool bitcoin isn't it.

1. Signature
2. The guy needs to be really rich.
3. If by "rejected", you mean is there any way the other guy can refuse to accept your money, then the answer is no.
4. You should know better than most of us, since you're there and most of us aren't. What shops there accept bitcoins? How do you convert bitcoins to rupees? How many people actually know about bitcions?

Bitcoin atm?
@_date: 2014-02-02 02:47:29
In New Zealand, we can log onto online banking, type in their account number and click transfer. It's usually free (or a few cents if you have a bad bank). It's instant if same bank, the next business day if different bank. It's how we pay friends back, how we pay tradesmen and how we pay for Trademe purchases (our version of ebay). I thought this would be universal, but the more I read about America, the more backwards it seems.

Yeah. There could be a trojan on the game that messes with the random number generator on the OS. So instead of generating a truly random private key, the computer would generate a private key within a small, known range. The attacker would then monitor those known keys and steal your coins. Of course, this is just a theoretical attack, but why take the risk when you've gone to the trouble of buying a new computer.

The burden isn't with the unit we measure bitcoins with. It's the fixed fees payable in fiat when you want to put money into the exchanges (eg wiring fees). Those fees make it less affordable to buy small amounts.

[Bit-Card]( sent me a free card with 0.005BTC as part of their promotion. Here's my brief review of the card.
The Bit-Card is a paper wallet printed on a piece of credit card sized plastic. On the [front]( there are three QR codes. One is the public address, one is the private key (covered under a hologram) and one is a [link]( to the Bit-Card website giving details to about the card.
You deposit by sending coins to the address. You withdraw by removing the hologram and scanning the private key QR code using your wallet software. When you give the card to someone, they can be sure the card is ok by firstly checking the hologram and then visiting the verification link.
What I like
* I like the design of the card
* The printing is high quality
* The hologram looks [quite complex](
* The card is nice and thick. It is thicker than a [credit card]( Note there's a layer of black plastic sandwiched between the layers as a security measure.
* There's brief instructions on the [back](
* It took over a month for the card to get here from Germany to New Zealand. Take this into account if you have time constraints.
* The QR code is quite small, so if the camera on your device is bad (like my Nexus 7), you won't be able to scan it.
* It was mailed stuck on a A4 sheet of paper like how you would get a credit card in the mail. The card got slightly bent on its way here.
Overall, this was a high quality product. I would recommend it if you want an attractive way of gifting bitcoins.

This is the least you could worry about. Here's a joke I read:
Not long ago, Al-Qaeda dispatched six terrorists to attack China. The first one to blow up the Xizhimen overpass in Beijing was stunned into dizziness by too many turns he had to make on the overpass and was stranded there.
The second one that was trying to blow up a bus in Beijing was unable to squeeze onto the overcrowded buses, and he lost his bomb in the crowd surrounding him.
The third one decided to plant a bomb in a Beijing supermarket and detonate it there. A pickpocket stole his detonating device when he was going into the supermarket.
The fourth one tried to sneak into a government building to put a bomb there. The guards blocked him and beat him senseless on the steps of the building, because they thought he was a person with grievance and was attempting to petition leaders of the government.
The fifth one tried to bomb the plaza stores in front of Guangzhou railway station in Guangdong Province of China. While he just walked out of the railway station, a group of motorcycling gangsters robbed him of his package of dynamite.
The last one finally bombed a coalmine and killed many people there. He then successfully returned to the Al-Qaeda base abroad. Half a year later Al-Qaeda executed him, because there was no relevant news report from China [mine explosions (and censorship thereof) are very common in China]. 
Bin Laden heard that China had promised that China would not increase stamp duty on transactions, and he thought the stock market there was bull. To expand his fund for terror in China, he invested 50 billion US dollars into China’s domestic stock market. He bought 100 stocks there and waited to sell them out once the share-prices went up. Suddenly Chinese government changed mind and announced that the stamp duty on transactions would be increased immediately. The stock prices dived to the bottom accordingly at once, and Bin Laden lost his entire fund for terror in China.
To stand up again and beat China in the next generation, Bin Laden adopted secretly some infants in China trying to train them to be terrorists after they grow up one day. He never thought that his plan ended in failure again because these babies were hit by melamine-tainted milk in China shortly after their secret adoption by him and Al-Qaeda.
After their lessons above, Al-Qaeda and Bin Laden finally concluded that China is the only country which Al-Qaeda has no ability to attack.

Bit-card generates addresses. Print codes on the cards. Put stickers over the private keys. Mail it out to you. When you confirm receipt, they load it up with coins.
You check the card's balance using the public address. When you want to redeem, you peel off the sticker and import the private key to your wallet.
You hand them out as Christmas presents to your nephews and nieces. Give them out as tips. Basically an evangelism tool.

blockchain.info is fine for small amounts. Use it for its convenient features. However, online wallets are getting hacked/shutdown all the time, so don't keep a large amount there. There's a wallet backup feature on bc.i, use it.
Keep a larger amount on your computer. I use Electrum. The risk here is your computer getting hacked or breaking. So keep a backup and set a password.
Keep the majority that you won't be using for a while in a paper wallet. Ideally, print 2 copies and put it in 2 different bank deposit boxes. This is the safest way to keep coins, but a but inconvenient. I use bitaddress.org.

@_date: 2013-06-25 04:42:18
You can use a secret-sharing tool to split your key, so you could give parts your secret key to say 3 people, and any two of them can recreate your secret key. Or there's n-of-m transactions too.

Think of it this way, there's only ever going to be 21M of these things. There's limited coins, and people would want to buy unlimited stuff in the world with it. The price therefore will rise.I would expect the price to stabilizes at a certain level if Bitcoin become successful in commerce.

First question: do you you know of an online money transfer method that is fast, cheap, easy and irreversible? No? That's why the buying bitcoins online situation is like this. The other option is buying in person. localbitcoins.com or one of the ATMs that are getting popular.

Here's the math. There are 2^256 or 1.2 × 10^77 possible private keys. If we get each person on earth to generate 2 billion billion billion keys each, then we would have a 0.1% chance that any two person will generate the same key. The probabilities are so low it is safe to say it won't happen.

More useful for people who get paid in BTCs.
@_date: 2013-07-15 12:24:04
I guess it is based on the ease of use. With public key cryptography, the website would generate a nounce, you type it into the authenticator, then you type the result back into the website. It's more steps than a simple time based code. My bank's auto token does both. You use the time based code when logging in, then there's a public key signing code when you make a transaction.
Anyways, it is not that important for stuff like gmail. If the attacker can read your MAC seed from the message verifier, then they probably can read the content being protected.

About the slogan in the green box on your homepage though. I had to read it a few times to understand. Would something like this be better:"You want to buy US-only products. You don't have a U.S. address and/or credit card. You have bitcoins. We can help."?

I don't know which country you are in, but generally, the burden of proof is on the [employer]( He has to prove he paid you.

**What is bitcoin**  
Point 2 can be removed  
Point 3: Bitcoins aren't actually stored in the wallets. The wallet stores the private keys that give you access to the coins. But that's a technical point that can be skipped. You do need to pay a transaction fee to get transactions processed on time.

Translated for you an article in today's Apple Daily, one of Hong Kong's main newspapers.
Various central banks around the world are performing QE, making major currencies depreciate, and causing people to lose confidence in central banks. Virtual currency Bitcoin is taking advantage of this, and transactions are no longer limited to the internet. Apart from people in Europe buying it due to Cyprus crisis, New Yorkers can also use it to pay rent.
NY real estate agent Alvic announced they are taking rent in Bitcoins. Residents welcome the new measure, saying it is as easy as credit cards, and they no longer have to mail cheques. Rent is denominated in USD, and converted to BTC according to the rates on the main exchange Mt.Gox. On Tuesday, one BTC equals 200 USD. This Bitcoin popularity shows people's faith in physical currencies are decreasing. In debt-ridden Spain, some residents are snapping up Bitcoins, to lessen the impact of falling Euros. Although Bitcoins are gaining popularity, it is not protected by law in any contry. Also, its exchange rate volatility is greater than other currencies and users can stay anonymous, so it carries certain risks.

You borrow it from the exchange. Not sure about the policy of this exchange, but the point here is leverage. 
Example: 
Bitcoins at $100 now. You sell 1 coin. You get $100. Bitcoins drop to $50. You buy coins. You now have 2 coins.
compare  
Bitcoins at $100 now. You short 2 coins (one of your own and one borrowed from the exchange). You get $200. Bitcoins drop to $50. You buy coins. You return the borrowed coin. You now have 3 coins.
(Of course, if the market goes the other way you would compound your losses too.)
