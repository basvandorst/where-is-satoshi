This question is too broad. Even for conjecture. We have to at least set some parameters to draw up intelligent, plausible outcomes. For instance, which cryptocurrency? How widely is it used? What is it used for and where?  
Also: in the broadest definition governments are already *restructuring* due to cryptocurrencies. They're talking about it, changing policy, observing, planning and taking action. Societal change =&gt; restructuring of government. So what. Be more specific. 
Devaluation of local currencies?   
That's already happening. It's called inflation. Besides, for a cryptocurrency to become that widespread is far off. Our infrastructure isn't there yet and even if it were...  
"wealth creation even for the poorest of people":   
Yeah, wealth will just begin spontaneously creating in the hands of the poorest people.
"new services based on micro-payments":  
Well, new micropayment services are already expanding so what's interesting about this? That there would be new ones? That's going to happen either way.

Except the volume in the EU is much much smaller, the media barely reports about it (in comparison to the USA) and there are fewer merchants who accept it. Also note the [volume differences]( see also [Fiat leak]( ["Mapping Bitcoin Adoption"]( In relation to adoption: note that the USA has around 315 million people and the EU has over 500 million. Almost all bitcoins are bought and sold on American and Chinese exchanges. The Chinese have 60% of bitcoins and [many Chinese bitcoiners are women]( (whereas my experience demonstrates that Scandinavian women don't know about or purposedly ignore bitcoin). 
As usual Europe is far behind on innovation and adoption and will let the USA take the lead and China follow up and outperform them.

Think: 30 days ago the consensus at reddit was that the previous all-time high would create a lot of resistance and $300 US/BTC still seemed far off. $1,000 US/BTC seemed to me like a wild fantasy maybe, at earliest, possible late in 2014 if we had months of good, sustained news.

Welcome. Btw, if you look at the exchanges, most of the sales/buys have decimals. It's a good way of reminding yourself that you first buy with an amount you feel comfortable investing, what that number equals in bitcoins is not necessarily immediately relevant.

Rundown on Sweden:
* [Some articles]( in Swedish. The media is still mostly negative and associates bitcoin with criminality (still in negative spin phase that the US was in months ago). 
* Bitcoin has almost no fungibility or adoption in Sweden.
* The exchanges have a very small volume and can remain stagnant for hours on end. You can set up a sell wall (or manipulate the market in similar ways) if you have as little as two bitcoins.
* Swedes who do know what bitcoin is are still just thinking about *maybe* getting some. The prices are now high and Swedes have almost no savings (compared to say Americans) and Swedes have some of the highest debts per capita of any Western country, which must play in, e.g. where are we going to find money to invest in bitcoin? The very concept of saving and buying assests is very different from in many other countries. The concept of putting money on metals is very rare here (compare to USA, Canada, India). That is to say, Swedes are not an investing people and know jack shit about capital, longterm financial planning. Most people barely even understand what the hell an interest rate on a savings account is. Of course this applies to other countries, but my travels and reading tell me it's much worse here than among the middleclass in China, Germany, India and the USA.
* We are far from talk-about-bitcoin-at-Thanksgiving-dinner-stage (compare to USA).  
* Swedes who do know about bitcoin see it as a threat to the welfare system and an already weakened economy. The politicians are avoiding it and shun it. The national tax agency, accountants, business owners and investors are unsure how the tax regulations will apply. Same elsewhere, but what will happen here is that we will simply follow along once the USA and Germany make a move, as we always do.
* As usual the USA is where innovation and adoption occurs, we catch on but are wary and China follows up quickly to outperform. I really think the level of bitcoin adoption is a reminder of how stunted the Scandinavian (and European) mind is. I know this observation may irritate some of you, but I really believe it's correct. We are great at taking something someone else has made and perfecting it (architecture, art, internet technologies, literature, music, coffee), but we are really weak at standing out in the front, innovating things. We love consensus and are--maybe not afraid of, but--generally uninterested in risk and trying new things (unless those new things are means of avoiding direct contact with other human beings).

The risky investment part is more of a problem for adoption at the moment, but the convenience part is a misunderstanding.

The "voluntary" you and other advocates speak of is a choice between once currency or another, but it is not a choice of currency or other system at all. Bitcoiners speak of revolution, but they have no interest in changing the system, they simply want to reform it and be at the top. Bitcoins or dollars, you're still dealing with an economic system based on property, wealth inequality, and implicit debt that forces people to use currency to represent, secure and entrench their place in a capitalist system.

If no one is forced to abide by the changes why do people buy, sell and purchase goods with bitcoin at given rates? Also, assuming bitcoin becomes a major currency, how would it be possible for people involved in that market to "ignore" changes made by big players? Bitcoin does not arise in or turn into a vacuum-packed system.
Many bitcoiners like to imagine a semi-utopic bitconia, where no force or violence is present in the system, but this, I think, is pure ideologue-nuttery.

No studies have been done on this so all we have are guesses and rough estimates. What's the percentage of theft of bitcoins by volume compared to other currencies by volume? No one knows, but if you simply follow a few simple steps in securing your keys and wallets, your bitcoins will be much more secure than your cash.
More often than not it seems that the theft is a result of very poor security on the user's behalf. Mainly: do not store large amounts of bitcoins online, encrypt them locally. It's very simple and should be very obvious why. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:28:06

Also: bitcoin is growing due to dollars (and other fiat) being pumped into it, people with the most of that can buy the many more bitcoins than most people. Do not forget that.

entering middle age and well-educated
I suspect that the bitcoin market is male-dominated. Most of us have some university education and/or are slacktivists trying to make easy money (i.e. millenials unwilling to put actual effort into conventional labor and longterm financial planning).  
I think this is important, because when bitcoiners rage about the redistribution of wealth that will result from bitcoin, ask yourself, who has the bitcoins? Who can figure out how to use them? Who knows how to secure a wallet? Encrypt disks? Etc.?   
I believe that so far it's mostly been "white" men (i.e. men raised in industrialzed countries), now followed by the burgeoning middleclass of China. Where's the redistribution of wealth there?   
Bitcoiners talk about a nerd revolution. So you mean the world will be controlled by a few million Bill Gateses? Where's the radical transformation in that?

Bitcoin does not exist in a vacuum. One of the biggest questions in its future is the possibility of political decisions affecting its value, use and adoption.  
@_date: 2013-11-08 10:25:21
I'm going to use your post as a springboard about the topic of the complexity of using cryptocurrency and the implications pertaining to its widespread adoption. 
It is complicated and I sometimes think this is a setback to the adoption of bitcoin, but imagine what it would be like coming from a nomadic hunter-gatherer society and trying to open a bank account, let alone give shared access to someone else.  
What is a bank?  
Why do I need it?  
How do I find a bank?    
How do I get a social security number/ID/bill, etc.?  
How do I get an address (email and/or post) to send stuff too?  
What is a residence and how do I prove it?  
What is an account and how do I pick one?  
What are pincodes?  
How do I use them?  
How do you expect me to remember these random digits?  
What's a CVC code?  
What's an expiration date and what do I have to do about it?  
What's this thing you call a wallet?  
Why shouldn't I carry it in my back pocket?  
What's an ATM?   
How do I withdraw funds?  
And so on.
I remind myself of how complicated this process is, because I believe it is in fact more complicated, although currently more convenient, than using and securing bitcoins.
The difference with bitcoin is that we haven't implicitly picked up the principles since childhood (parents using them books, TV, jokes, etc.), opened a first account for a minimum wage job, learned and been disciplined into dozens of other procedures that make traditional banking second nature. 
Thinking of it this way I believe it becomes clear that adoption of cryptocurrency will eventually become second nature, especially among the generation growing up and watching their parents use it.

If an oligarchy is a system in which the power is managed by a superior clique, isn't it exeedingly likely that we'd repeat the process with bitcoins (e.g. in the case they became the world reserve currency as many around here seem to think), simply as a result of the scarity of the bitcoins and their exponentially increased value?   
In fact, doesn't the very conversation we're having relate to an argument about which select few will control the future? (e.g. [Bill Gates vs. Elon Musk]( [Edison vs. Tesla](
In addition, aren't we currently seeing walls created by large players and market control based on ethnicity and nationality?
How is bitcoin responsible for trickle down?


To some extent I agree. However, I know several people and daily read here and on blogs about those who've taken out credit to buy bitcoins. Moreoever, what will prevent bitcoins from being taken out through loans in the future? How would bitcoins in themselves prevent indentured servitude and other debt-based socio-economic systems?

@_date: 2013-11-09 18:42:20
I believe I understand what you're saying with oligarchies. At this point I can only add two things on that that I think should modify your statement.  
First, it's not the motivations but the results. That is, "great" motivations (intentions) don't necessarily provide the result you want or a "great" result.  
Second, we really don't know how bitcoin is going to play out, so statements about its future are pure speculation. The only thing separating speculation x from speculation y is plausibility based on research and rational thought, but as is often said, the past does not dictate future outcome. This brings me to the next point.
The Federal Reserve was well-intentioned, like bitcoin. Its decentralized nature and checks and balances (for instance twelve reserve banks, budget autonomy, Board of Governers, audit of statements and balance sheets) were thought to prevent interest of political parties. I'm not really sure how we should even say there'd be *more* checks and balances with bitcoin compared to the Federal Reserve. After all, if we're quantifying checks and balances we should actually list them, go through them, analyze them comparatively. Of course, this glosses over fundamental structural differences between the Fed and bitcoin--and on that point I agree with you and most people here, that bitcoin is very promising.
I'm still unclear about the trickle down through bitcoin, but we can leave that.
The walls: well, I'm more into market analysis of bitcoin than the philosophy of it. In part because I've only known of bitcoin for a short time. Just to be clear: the walls are not social or political walls, but trading walls you'll see if you know how to read and follow the bitcoin charts (naturally I'm not sure what your approach or knowledge is of these things). Basically it's like this, you watch the walls grow on the charts, creating different price "walls" that affect the buying and selling prices of bitcoin. The walls on the Chinese market have been particularly interesting to follow recently. What we see though, is that the nations that already lead the economy, and people with a lot of money to invest strategically, are also the nations, and people, that are ahead in the game of bitcoin. In that sense bitcoin is only an outgrowth of our current monetary system, although it will change things a lot if it becomes widely accepted.
Do you think the future will see people taking out loans to get bitcoin? This is happening now to some extent, if what I read and hear is true. I can foresee a future in which people are forced into labor or to work as sex slaves or pay of debts in bitcoins. The currency in itself can't prevent that kind of debt, right?

The risks we're talking about here are government investments in bitcoin structure. We're talking about a few percent of the population putting a few beers' worth of money on bitcoin.
Compared to many countries Sweden's doing alright, but the future doesn't look that great and the economy is not what it used to be. The social programs are all being chopped off, but fortunately not as fanatically as in places like England. Depending how all this plays out it may turn out that "one of the strongest socialist countries in the EU" is going to be broken by a brutal paradigm shift where the Euro or the dollar collapses. Due to the country's infrastructure I think this would be a bigger shock to the country than for most other European countries.

Incorrect. Remember: the OP is talking about buying and adopting bitcoins. 
The process takes at least a few days for most users (bank transfer, approval at exchange, etc.), some people have to wait weeks to get their accounts approved. Many have to learn to use new programs, have problems understanding the instructions, etc. People don't just jump right into bitcoins. It's not like borrowing a fiver from a friend.
Fiat: we already have it. You know how to use your bank account, it's stocked with money. You probably have cash on hand. Fiat is accepted everywhere. You swipe the card or pay in cash and payment is immediate (bitcoins take 10 minutes to hours to approve) and so on.
