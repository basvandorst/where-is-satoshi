He’s diversifying. It’s smart with crypto, and smart with Shrek DVDs. My guess is he’s trying to find some Shrek 2 original release copies.

Generally, don’t. Coinbase is an exchange, not a real wallet. Right now Coinbase controls your bitcoin.  A fundamental idea of bitcoin is that individual person controls their own bitcoin funds, not a third party.
Exchanges have closed taking everyone’s bitcoin with them.   An exchange could be hacked.  
Generally speaking you should get a paper or digital wallet and keep control of your own bitcoin.

Made my first purchase of $350 two weeks ago. Wanted a piece of what was happening before it got more expensive. 
Am now doing a lot of research into underlying principles, wallets, and speculations.  Learning about other cryptocurrencies as well.
Used Coinbase for original purchase. Super easy to use. Now looking to move my coin onto a secure wallet. Will continue to immerse myself in learning. 
Planning on a $500 purchase once BTC dips back a bit from the 6k mark. Looking to drop $200-$300 each paycheck into this in order to eventually work my way up to 1BTC. After that, we'll see.
But it's super easy to put your $300 into it on pure fun investment gamble and then learn more in order to make actual, informed investment decisions.

It means hold. As in "don't sell."
