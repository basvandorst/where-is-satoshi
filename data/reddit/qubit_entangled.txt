A universal income doesn't reduce competition, it increases it. Also, the funding of the universal income comes from verification of transactions on the blockchain under the global economy. Rather than paying for electricity, it pays humanity, and so keeps us all above a certain level. Humans who desire, can work and earn more to rise further.

No oil to mine silver, so bugger all silver for solar panels. No fuel to ship them.

Excited about the crappy legacy system ... lie down with them rats, expect to get the plague.

I suspect the majority of humanity are masochistic. If their sexual partners arent bashing them up, they derive their dose of degradation via the legacy financial and political systems. 
Lie to me, treat me like shite, and take my assets  ... and I'll be back tomorrow for more.

Mao = communism. Socialism is not communism.

You mean socialism for the ultra wealthy via business tax cuts. Because trickle down economics, though it has never works, should be tried over, and over, and over.

Peak Oil, the point where more energy is required than oil produced, this will be the end of most resource mining. No minerals to build Bitcoin Miners. Hard to transport across the globe. Bitcoin does have weaknesses.

Each member of the group gets an equal portion of the rewards.  That's socialism. 
Bitmain dominating and guaranteeing that domination is capitalism.

A universal basic income removes the threat of starvation and homelessness. What's the point of organising ourselves into a society, if we can't guarantee each other these basic rights.

So a collaboration with central bank's fiat system and bitcoin. Why the need to validate dollars since there is no work creating extra zeros on a computer screen.

Advertising you're going dark seems silly since someone could follow him, to find his new location, and then sell that info on. If I had a reason to go dark, I would do it and then not tell anyone.

Socialism is throughout nature.

Your system is based on endless money printing of fiat, while the money is not earned from any activity. No requirement to validate fiat. It would be like validating toilet paper rolls on bitcoin blockchain.  
Meanwhile PoC could fund a universal income, via validating all global activity on it's main blockchain, or it multitude sidechains, if it was selected method by governments to replace the crashing legacy system and kickstart the economy from a deep depression.

PoC ; staking coins in nodes. Nodes validate, Staked coins earn passive income.  A PoC blockchain under the global economy could bring in enough revenue for governments, so to fund a living wage for their citizens.  That's if governments buy coin and run and stake nodes.

Bet all the toilet tissue companies are shitting themselves.

Governments without revenue are powerless. So if governments don't provide, people will organise themselves. Groups will form and stake nodes collectively, so to earn community passive income,  and so financially supporting the whole group. Once groups are seen improving, others will follow. Socialism on the blockchain. 
Governments of old go extinct.
