well, there is always coineffene hopefully.
@_date: 2015-05-02 04:42:09
Wow, you are generous.  I tip my hat to you.
@_date: 2015-08-28 12:10:58
I imagine they are making a 1000 percent profit on that.
@_date: 2015-04-14 22:07:55
I'll take the bait!  Thanks for doing what you do.
@_date: 2015-04-21 17:10:51
Totally awesome Tuesday.

The hard part about this is that the lack of anonymity is a feature.  For example, the ability to track funds works perfectly for our "public servants" known as the government.
However, currency doesn't work if it can all be tracked an blacklisted.  These anonymity features absolutely have to be integrated into bitcoin or in the long run it will fail.  At least as an option so that the common public can enjoy anonymity while the government can be tracked.  That is the way things should be.

I'd love to get over there.  Count me in.
@_date: 2015-09-03 14:00:40
As much as I'd love to get some tea from you guys, I got no job, so all the bitcoin I have is in storage.

The situation with zerocoin is progressing, but they are doing things in a meticulous way.  They are creating a great deal of solutions to each part of the system, and have modularized everything in a way that will allow people to pick and choose the best solutions.  The problem is that a lot of it is high level math that doesn't exist, or doesn't exist in this context, so it really is taking a long time. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 01:22:03
I have also, but I question those guys organization skills.   We need core development from someone who is a project management professional with high level mathematics and coding experience.  These people are very expensive, but they are worth it.

It has had an impact.  An entire sphere of decentralized cryptographically secured money related systems exists because of bitcoin.  Even if one of it's derivatives is the "main stream" project you are talking about it... bitcoin is responsible. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 06:23:46
Well, I'll give it a shot.
@_date: 2015-02-08 21:57:20
Bitcoin can do this too.
@_date: 2015-02-24 20:17:29
Always is a happy day.

I think there is a good chance that decentralized servers are just around the corner.  Kinda like a bittorrent, but actually serving live web sites.  Once that happens, you won't be able to shut down a web site, and that means that with code, just about anything can happen.
I can think of quite a few models that wouldn't require any human guidance off the top of my head. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 07:50:33
No point. Governments want control and BTC gives them very little control.  They won't accept it unless they have to.
@_date: 2015-02-08 07:01:10
I could deal with that.!
@_date: 2015-02-08 08:00:33
Not sure how much I like the concept of giving extensions permissions related to money.

There are also far more basic functions that can be served by programming though. If you break down some systems out there, they really don't need much logic to function. Take sales for example; A company that drop ships pens while making no money (taking 0 margins) itself could easily be programmed because all it needs to do is take money in BTC, hold it in escrow, and then release it on delivery to the manufacturer. The only money the autonomous company would need to hold would be enough to pay for expenses. In cases of scams or other problems, conditional code would need to be written, but in simple businesses, there really aren't that many conditions that would need to be accounted for.
In more complicated business scenarios, these companies would need to integrate more comprehensive logic, and I am not sure how they would do it. But I am of the mindset that it can be done. The code may be extremely complicated, but it is possible.

You could publish a hash of the full code so that as it is compiled by your "bittorrent syle web browser," it checks the hash against a known published value.  
@_date: 2015-02-05 12:25:08
I see no problem with it although it is an issue that is a bit ahead of its time.
@_date: 2015-02-05 22:40:47
That would really screw miners until 16nm comes out.
@_date: 2015-02-08 15:23:43
Maybe this is one of those things that shouldn't be taken exactly literally.
@_date: 2019-05-12 21:04:34
it isn't something that will happen overnight.  it may take 50 years more.

The whole point of autonomy is that you don't register or get permission from any human.  You simply exist.  It is like a co-op where there is maximum efficiency and maximum payouts for its members because there is no giant bloated company that requires overhead.  
@_date: 2015-02-09 23:47:45
Yeah, I kinda agree.  Just trying to get a serious discussion going and that is something that jump starts people.
@_date: 2015-02-24 20:23:33
I don't think mycellium has ever had any known problems with their crypto.  Most likely it was another app on your phone.
@_date: 2019-05-12 21:10:29
Seems reasonable.  I'm not sure that I will live long enough to see the end, but my kids will.  I'll hold for them.
@_date: 2015-02-08 21:13:18
Why don't you answer the question instead of getting angry and drawling conclusions about what I was saying.
Ok governments adapt, make new laws, new systems. How? What kinds of laws and systems can you make that would stop people from coding autonomous companies that don't respond to normal laws?
If you answer is that they just shut the servers down, that really isn't plausible. Once this technology is out of the bag, there will be places in the world where it is legal, and those places will experience the benefits of increased efficiency and the consequences of money that has to the potential to flow more directly to the populace.  What are those consequences?  I have no idea, but that is why I posted this. It is a place to bring your ideas forward, not just talk smack and be a dick.

They can as long as the U.S. dollar maintains the reserve status.  Reserve status basically means guaranteed demand.  Or rather the fact that the dollar is demanded world wide makes it the currency of reserve.  But either way you think about it, when that demand starts to dry up (which would imply there is a stable alternative) is really when people better be worrying. 
People think all the wars and regime changes and whatnot the U.S. pulls off are all about oil, but it is really about ensuring the dollar retains the reserve status.
