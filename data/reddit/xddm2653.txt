if a billionaire constantly spent his money, the economy would collapse. By investing in stocks or bonds he helps the economy grow, and is rewarded by a portion of the growth (or interest)

That's what I'm saying though, it's unlikely for the coin to replace US currency. Spending and lending and investing all can be done through the dollar while bitcoin stays deflationary.
If bitcoin *wasn't* deflating, that would mean the value would go down over time and given the limited supply why would anyone use it?
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:42:29

You realize most of these exchanges reimburse customers if they get hacked? and the ones that don't are never going to get business again.
and fyi, I just looked at coinbase policy. At the result of a hack (and not individual compromise of your own account) the digital funds would in fact be insured
@_date: 2019-08-16 06:06:47
That's my total volume correct? So if I sell $25k of bitcoin, rebuy at a lower price for 25k and sell it again later, it will say they "paid" me $50,000 even if I don't withdraw?
I might need a CPA.

That is the design of a government. Everyone chips in a little and gives up something, for the greater benefit. Same reason we pay taxes. You could argue we are the most powerful nation now because of this practice


Even if there was no 'stealing' from the fed, your dollar would not buy as many things today as it will in a few years. Inflation is a natural byproduct. A closed money system can not exist, as you said, because businesses will always charge more year after year for goods.


Could you explain why it is actually bad the Fed is not undergoing risk? If they were at risk of collapsing and taking the whole economy with them, I would be much more worried

Interesting read. A couple of counter points though:
The fed is not an individual person. They are doing this for the country's benefit, not so some government official can pocket all that free money. Mild inflation beats hyper inflation &amp; deflationary monies. Gold was the original hedge against this problem
Investing in assets is how to make inflation work for you. Saving 1 or 2 units of money isn't a smart investment in any economy. You need to buy appreciating assets and live off those, so the amount of money you gain from them goes up over time
Being able to borrow money is a benefit, not a problem

yes I generally agree with you. However, nobody can predict any market in the world without illegal insider trading. Investing in real estate, stocks, or bitcoin might be a "gamble", but it's a gamble with winning odds.

I'm here to get rich quick man not become the world's next expert on bitcoin. The simplicity of cash app is the only reason I'm interested right now. 
But to your point, hackers basically just look for these seeds and then they basically have access to an entire wallet? Interesting
@_date: 2019-05-31 20:42:44




lol no, the reason is because of what you just said, and also if you notice they're charging an extra spread on bitcoin. So they get paid twice with BTC
@_date: 2019-05-06 05:17:45

@_date: 2019-05-06 03:13:30
Kk and newb question, is a seed tied to a specific wallet? So multiple wallets = multiple seeds?
@_date: 2019-05-06 05:26:38
It's no different than leaving cash on cash app right? I leave a few hundred dollars on there, that is the same risk right?
Also does having a pin prevent a hacker from making transactions on my account? If so I feel pretty safe about it. Either way I'll still get end up getting a hardware
