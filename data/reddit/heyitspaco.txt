That was thoughtful. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 00:36:20
Thanks man! 
@_date: 2014-05-25 01:17:41
Yes, that is exactly what I mean!
@_date: 2014-05-09 21:31:21
My comment was meant to be humorous sir, not to be taken seriously. I have received tips and will be tipping others in subreddits unrelated to bitcoin to increase exposure to those outside of the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2014-05-08 17:23:02
Can we use changetip in all the subreddits or just If so, it would be a great way to expose more people to bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-05-08 10:55:20
I want the biggest fucking tip in this thread!
@_date: 2014-04-30 21:42:52
Very interesting. 
@_date: 2014-04-26 01:31:54
I always run my web browser in Sandboxie when dealing with my bitcoin accounts. It is freeware, I highly recommend learning about it and utilizing it to deal with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-15 02:20:32
Thank you sir, I will definitely be paying it forward.
@_date: 2014-05-28 07:58:31
I personally don't even read the comments on mainstream channels that have a bitcoin video. Reading them makes me wanna pull my hair out.
@_date: 2014-06-03 07:37:18
Blue for sure!

I have been learning about trading for the past few months and finally decided to dedicate a small amount of my btc stash to trading the LTC/BTC market at btc-e. I am just doing it to put my knowledge to the test and get a taste of what its like to trade. The only coin I have long term faith in is BTC.
@_date: 2014-05-08 18:48:38
Thanks man! Very kind of you sir!
@_date: 2014-06-03 04:20:52
Hey OP, I think this thread is keeping the price artificially low. Thanks for creating the opportunity for us to get more cheap coins before we go to the moon!
@_date: 2014-05-10 00:04:45
Thank you very much Chakra! Very kind of you!
@_date: 2014-05-13 08:31:34
Thanks buddy!!
@_date: 2014-05-10 15:32:49
Thanks man! Time for me to find somebody to 'Tip It Forward' to!
@_date: 2014-05-15 01:06:25
It is hard to name just one. I think the huge amount of bitcoin start ups that have been springing up lately is a positive sign. Bloomberg deciding to list bitcoin is also a huge positive development. Lastly, there have been a lot of high profile figures that have been speaking in favor of bitcoin. I am excited for the future!!
@_date: 2014-05-13 00:39:53
I am not OP but I think tipping outside of the community should be done as much as possible. It will encourage others who have never heard of bitcoin before to research it. Not only will they possibly become adopters themselves, they will also spread word of bitcoin to their friends whom may have never heard of it either. 
@_date: 2014-05-09 20:52:28
Somebody should tip me 1BTC so that everybody in this thread who missed the earlier tip can see it happen!
@_date: 2014-05-22 07:30:36
Didn't we hit $530 about a month ago and crash back to around $430? Why is this rally going to be any different? Every rally in recent memory has been met by a bearish backlash soon after.
@_date: 2014-06-01 03:36:41
Why in the hell doesn't this have more upvotes? This is great!!! Keep the stories coming guys!!!
@_date: 2014-08-10 01:31:17
Poker players are pretty knowledgeable about bitcoin. Here is a recent thread I saw on TwoPlusTwo the other day about bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-16 23:45:43
Same here! Just about every spare dollar I make has gone to bitcoin. Even beer money! I am up to 3 now!
@_date: 2014-05-08 19:16:41
Thank you very much!

Before sending everything to cold storage, practice doing it with small amounts first. Then wait at least 24 hours to make sure that your cold storage address has not been compromised before depositing anymore. 
@_date: 2014-05-14 17:44:41
I could really go for a joint or a bowl!
@_date: 2014-07-26 08:27:12
Just-Dice.com had an emergency withdrawal address feature very similar to that I believe. They used it to send users back their coins that hadn't logged in to claim them when they shutdown the site.
@_date: 2014-05-08 18:02:58
The bitcoin community is very generous, thank you. I wouldn't mind a tip if you have anymore to spare. Can changetip be used in all subreddits? It would be a great way to increase exposure!
@_date: 2014-05-10 16:39:39
Thanks pal!
@_date: 2014-05-25 02:42:27
Is your channel NurdRage? I happen to be a subscriber!
@_date: 2014-05-08 15:49:59
Thank you so much sir! This is awesome!
@_date: 2014-05-28 06:24:21
Yeah,  on your list was messed up man. It also took them a while to acknowledge the man in the photographs was not the actual creator. It was very misleading.
@_date: 2014-05-14 18:46:54
Thank you kind sir!
@_date: 2014-07-22 13:21:09
This is also my favorite introductory video on bitcoin. I shared this with a few friends that knew next to nothing about bitcoin and they all said that it gave them a much better understanding on the subject. I really wish this video had more views.
@_date: 2014-07-06 01:14:03
How you will feel a year or two later about your first purchase: "Fuck, those bitcoins would have bought me a house at today's value!!"
@_date: 2014-07-08 00:49:59
To the moon!
@_date: 2014-05-09 20:46:58
1BTC I believe!
@_date: 2014-08-13 19:33:09
Same here. Watch_Dogs should have used Bitcoin as their in game currency, it would have fit in so well in that game. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 01:10:41
Thanks Buddy!
@_date: 2014-05-25 04:06:00
Much appreciated sir.
@_date: 2014-04-30 21:19:32
Same exact situation for me! Are you bit chick on the bitcointalk forums?
@_date: 2014-06-09 03:54:06
Pshh, I don't type the URL, I enter the web servers I.P. address. That's how a real man browses the web.

When I first got in to bitcoin it was so fascinating to me. Like many others, I got sucked in to it. I learned everything that my limited intelligence allowed for me to learn. I spent hour after hour reading/watching everything bitcoin related I could get my hands on.
 It seems that as Bitcoin has gotten more and more mainstream, it is becoming centralized in a way. There seems to be much more politics involved now and a lot more greed. I used to think bitcoin would change the world in a massively positive way. I just don't get that sense of excitement for it like I used to, and it is not because I have lost interest. It is because of the current state it is in. I haven't actually invested in bitcoin in a very long time. I only use it now to buy my drugs, I never hold my coin for more than an hour now. 
@_date: 2014-07-21 00:33:29
Yeah, some pictures in my porn collection go up to 8000x6000. And they are a couple years old. The close ups are mind blowing.
@_date: 2014-05-09 20:37:19
It's great that this is being done, but I think it would be more effective to do something like this in a subreddit that is not related to bitcoin in any way. We could really increase exposure to people that may have never even heard of bitcoin before. Turning those people into bitcoin owners would spark them to further research the technology and possibly adopt it and spread word of it to others.
@_date: 2014-07-06 02:12:02
@_date: 2016-03-07 08:11:52
Yep, this was my theory as well. It's like a form of insider trading. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:34:50
Funny how they mention that 300k litecoin were also stolen but they didn't bother to leave a return address for that. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 19:36:58
Drop me a PM if you are truly interested in using the markets. I'll try to help you out.
@_date: 2014-08-08 03:52:07
Telling my dad about my investment into bitcoin was one of the biggest mistakes I have made in recent memory. He was constantly making bearish comments about it every time I would see him. It got so bad I eventually had to lie to him and told him that I closed my position at $580 back in May during the rally up from the $400's. Aside from what he would see on cnbc and bloomberg, he knew nothing about bitcoin, nor did he make any attempt to learn about it.
@_date: 2014-05-28 05:19:10
Whoops, the actual name of the channel is "WatchMojo.com". 
@_date: 2016-03-03 20:26:32
r/technology is on the front page of r/bitcoin too!

I recommend that his privileges be revoked as well.

The fees are outrageous. I use BLUR to shop online with virtual credit cards. No fees other than the 5$ a month membership. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 02:54:54
He actually brings up some great points.
@_date: 2015-07-06 22:08:36
Nice job! Thank you for helping to keep the hoes in business so I can continue to have my fun!

I just looked through my account settings and I couldn't even find an option to upload an ID at all. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 03:31:11
 I chose them based on the stats on this site: 
@_date: 2016-02-28 18:41:01
Possible I guess. I have been with them for over a year. 
@_date: 2016-02-28 02:28:46
Use Circle, I stopped using Coinbase a long time ago. Circle allows for instant buys with a debit card. I can purchase up to $3,000 in BTC instantly per week. Your limits may be lower at first, but they increase them the more you use it. You don't need to upload an ID. 
@_date: 2016-02-22 02:08:41
Fiat unaffected! 
@_date: 2016-02-28 18:27:48
I have a 3k per week limit, no ID given. They increase limits the more you use it.
@_date: 2015-09-15 00:03:44
I have used a lot more than usual too. Mainly buying drugs lol. 
@_date: 2015-09-15 02:15:13
There are 2 days in august that had negative numbers. Is that an error in the recording of the data? 
@_date: 2015-09-15 01:31:46
Thank you. Very interesting.

One thing that I don't hear mentioned very often is that there are close to 3 million more bitcoin in existence than in dec 2013. It is going to potentially take more to pump the price than the last bubble.
