Product, probably an album from gramatik, instant since it was 0 confirm. Or actually I used it for takeaway last week, it's a delivery food service, and it was instant, 0 confirm. Like two weeks ago used namecheap for domains, instant. Also used bitcoin for my vpn and flights like a month ago, both instant. I use bitcoin at least once a week on purchases and it's pretty much always instant. There's only been one instance that it wasn't and thats because it was a large transaction. 
Sent a donation to wikipedia yesterday it was 0 confirm.

The btc they're required to hold comes from the people looking to sell. The exchange provides a platform, they don't sell btc to people and then send it to them, all they do is take the btc from the sellers account and credit to the buyers account.

he doesn't and it isn't. ask alameda/b2c2/jump for a quote and compare it to the exchanges. OTC desks pull liquidity from all of the exchanges as well as internalize flow, there's no such thing as otc markets drying up.
@_date: 2019-07-22 16:35:22
Why would they need any bitcoin? The sellers on the exchanges sell to the buyers, so their bitcoin goes to the buyers on the exchanges; the exchange doesn't need to own any bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2019-07-23 11:02:39
Correct. The otc desks source liquidity from all the exchanges (in addition to internalizing flow against other clients), so if "otc dried up", that means the market is literally dead.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:55:58
If you send btc to a bch address or vice versa on the app it just arrives at the corresponding wallet as they use the same address derivation, so no... Even if you misunderstood the difference, it wouldn't cause any issues. 
@_date: 2019-07-22 21:58:46
this is pure bullshit. OTC liquidity has not dried up.... at all. Exchanges can't have more liquidity than OTC as OTC desks have access to all the liquidity on the exchanges... Furthermore, bakkt isn't buying btc, its btc comes from its users, same as any other exchange. Sellers deposit the btc, buyers deposit the USD.

You do realize a market order is instant right? They could go do a market order right now, there wouldn't be time for rumors to spread. And bitmex research report uses the same source that has them owning &gt;$150mm worth of btc. Again, you're a fucking idiot.

How about the $150mm of btc?
Over 500k of bch has already been liquidated by xapo, bitmex, and gbtc, yet the price still held up. So even conservatively they'd still be able to get &gt;$100mm for their bch.
And are the s9s still profitable to mine? Yes. So... That has value as well. Just cause you hate bitmain doesn't change reality.

they place orders on an exchange or sweep the orders on the exchanges if they're less sophisticated. 


exchange fees. 


the large otc desks often do market making and provide a lot of liquidity as well. plus they pay tons in trading fees. 


if demand outpaces supply then the price goes up until more people are willing to sell. That's how any market works.

it's not no onchain scaling versus 100% onchain scaling... You could do 2mb now while you build out offchain scaling solutions that will pave the way for visa levels of tx throughput. Lightning is going to need bigger blocks anyway, and raising the blocksize now would have an immediate effect on transaction throughput and fees.

You're an idiot. If there are bids on the books, that means that right now they could sell that bch with a market order and get out over $10mm, which directly contradicts your earlier statement about being lucky to get that much out.
Let's see the source then. The source that you're relying on for their bch holdings says they have &gt;$150mm worth of btc. That's far from "virtually all" their btc.

You can just look at the order book depth on exchanges, hell of a lot more than 10mm in bids. Also, they still hold btc... They didn't sell it all. The same source you're using for their bch holdings says they hold $150mm in btc

In my opinion it is largely due to the introduction of the maker-taker fee schedule implemented by OKCoin. They now reward makers with a portion of the fees paid by takers.

This is a wee bit harder for me to answer but to the best of my knowledge it's a way to show how money is moving around in the market. For instance if an early adopter moves his btcs from a cold wallet where it's been stored for years to an exchange a shitload of BTC days would be destroyed. So, when record amounts of btc days are destroyed it's generally a sign that something big either just happened or is about to happen. Many people see it as a good time to sell because they think a whale is going to drop his coins. 
That's my understanding of it. Although I bet someone here could give you a better example.

Lots of reasons. But i'll just give you the quickie. 
* .com has a USD order book, .cn has a CNY order book(completely seperate)  
* .com is ran by a company registered in Singapore, .cn is run by a company registered in China
* Having the international site(.com) ran by a Singaporean company protects its users from any rulings the Chinese government might make about bitcoin. For instance, imagine if China implemented the Bitlicense and said "you have to give us your entire userbase, their names, id's etc." they can say ok, and give them all the users from the .cn site, but won't be obligated to give them the users from the .com site. 
* .cn site is 0-fee, .com uses a maker-taker fee schedule  
* .com has futures trading with 10x leverage, but no p2p lending. .cn has p2p lending but no futures. 
There's a little bit more to it than that, but that's the essentials.

Actually thats much more likely with a street dealer. Street dealers don't have reviews and often have a monopoly on a certain area.

Here's a little bit more detailed explanation:
1 bitcoin that's 1 day old moves: 1 bitcoin days destroyed
2 bitcoin that's 1 day old move: 2 bitcoin days destroyed
1 bitcoin that's 2 days old moves: 2 bitcoin days destroyed
2 bitcoin that's 2 days old move: 4 bitcoin days destroyed 
So, it's just how old the btc is(number of days since last moved) multiplied by how many btc equals days destroyed. For a larger example 100 btc that's 200 days old: 20,000 days destroyed.

A perfect example of this is Singapore, America tells every country that it has ties with to release the tax records(income, how much money they have in the bank, share holdings etc) of US citizens in their countries. America asks Singapore to do this and they say "go fuck yourself" and that's pretty much the end of that. And Singapore *will* be the financial center of the world in the future. Businesses *will* move away from America if it's regulations kill their business. The power is moving away from America.

No... Products in China are based in CNY and products in Japan are based on the Yen. How often do you see products only priced in BTC? Almost never. Furthermore, when you do(like trezor wallets) people complain that they are too expensive in USD -- granted that has to do with the rising price of BTC. Another example is transaction fees; people don't complain that .001 BTC is too much, they complain that the equivalent of .001 BTC in USD is too much.
However, we're still very early on in the game and this very well could--I expect and hope it does-- change.

You have to secure another citizenship before renouncing your old one, or you can be given asylum in another country, but that is generally reserved for people who were forced out of their country, not people who chose to leave.

* First futures exchange with stop orders
* First and only exchange with fixed margin mode and cross margin mode for futures trading.  
* First and only exchange with algo orders (trailing, trigger, Iceberg, and TWAPs)  
* First exchange with a full-featured trading app (candlestick charts, futures &amp; spot trading, trading calculator, and all account info)  
* They overtook BitStamp and BitFinex in USD (in addition to CNY) trade volume [source](
* They have done proof of reserves and had the highest % of customer funds in reserves of any exchange. [source]( and [source](
* They signed a 3 billion euro hedge fund [source] (
* Tim Draper is one of their investors([source]( in them and they are one of the best funded exchanges in the world, [source](
* They are the largest exchange in the world by pretty much every metric; funding($11,000,000), employees (~150), spot trading volume, and futures trading volume.

OKCoin now has an [international site]( that doesn't have 0-fee trading and is separate from the [Chinese exchange]( and so the volume is similar to that of bitstamp and bitfinex, they did take them over for a bit a few weeks ago but their spot trading volume has slowed down as their futures volume picked up to be the largest in the world.

Arguably the best exchange in the world has 0 fees. OKCoin has the best liquidity of any exchange by a large margin. They have margin trading, algorithmic trading tools, and as of this week futures trading. They might not have a pretty site but for trading, it's the best exchange around.

That involved telling a company "stop", not shutting down an entire protocol--which is impossible by the way. 


You've never been to China have you? Video Game consoles [were banned until recently]( Porn is banned here yet every single DVD shop has it. Prostitution is illegal here and that doesn't stop anyone. And let me get this right, you're calling the country with over a [hundred protests a day]( a non-rebellious people. China also blocks a lot of the internet, but why do so many of my Chinese friends have facebook? Cause they all have VPNS. China censors words on the internet, the people create new ones, 草泥马(grass mud horse/fuck your mother). 


Right, like the one child policy, cause they're definitely still not overpopulated. But no, the Chinese resist and the government has to back down. Going back to the Chinese being non-rebellious, I'd take some time to look into the MASSIVE population of those that were been born under the table, without government knowledge.  And way to reference something from 1989, things have changed... In the words of Rob Gifford:
"after the killing of the students in Tainanmen Square in 1989, the Communist Party leaders made an unwritten unspoken deal with the people of China: Stay out of politics, and you can do anything you want."

Ah the deflationary vs inflationary.

People need clothes, transportation, services(cell phones, car fixed, cable/wifi etc.) and bitcoin just improves on what we employ to pay for these things today; cash and credit cards. 
Nope. But people did lose tons of money in the impending stock market crash, housing crash, and general recession caused by something that our regulations failed to prevent.

I don't know what world you're living in but Coinbase has made purchasing bitcoin easy and has drove adoption. Without Coinbase there's no way we would be where we are today. If coinbase was a flop then they wouldn't have gone on to raise another big round of funding with huge investors because the investors would see right through them and how they are a "flop". But maybe you buttcoiners are just way smarter than the VCs. 


Whoever says that wall street isn't getting into bitcoin is delusional. NYSE has invested in a bitcoin startup, NASDAQ is researching bitcion uses, Goldman Sachs invested in Circle, Blythe Masters joined a bitcoin startup, her ex-husband started GABI. Wall St. **is** getting into bitcoin, just because they haven't poured money into buying bitcoin or haven't drove the price up to whatever people want it to be doesn't mean that wall street isn't getting into it. 


Forgot about the bank pullout, I'll concede that. 


I've heard about it plenty of times. And if you expect something to be on the tips of everyone's tongues 6 months after being released, you'll consider pretty much everything to be a flop. That's unrealistic standards. 


It's been around for about what, a year, if that? How long did it take to build eBay/Amazon? A hell of a lot longer than that. And design issues can easily be fixed.


No, it was going to lead to increased remittances using bitcoin. And you say Africa like it isn't 54 countries, bit-pesa does remittances to Kenya, one country out of 54. 


"From their published stats, I could see how this would be considered a flop." You obviously didn't read what I said.


Nobody said they were going to save the day. They said that this adds credibility to bitcoin and it will *help* drive mainstream adoption. Nobody said, "well expedia accepts it now, so tomorrow we'll have 1 billion users". 


There has been progress. Just because you aren't paying attention doesn't mean it isn't happening. 


No it wasn't. Show me one post where anyone (not americanpegasus) said that all these MIT students are going to drop out because they have $100 in bitcoin and change everything.


Not overnight like you seem to believe.


And for good reason. Everyone there says that they are tulips and beanie babies. Why doesn't microsoft/expedia/dell/newegg accept beanie babies and tulips for payments? They were bragging because very large companies obviously seem some promise in the technology otherwise they wouldn't bother. It adds legitimacy to bitcoin and, again, *helps* drive mainstream adoption. It doesn't do it single handedly. 


Having like 200 worldwide is a loooong ways away from "all over the place". 


All you did was respond with bitcoin doesn't have 7 billion users and the prices isn't $400,000/coin so everything in this industry is dead and it's a flop.

I was at a very nice restaurant in Boracay, Philippines. One of the nicer on the island(Epic was the name) and a friend and I befriended a hostess. She was gorgeous. We asked her how much she makes, and it's less than a $1 an hour... at one of the nicest places. She works a 10 hour shift, and about $8/day. Now, a hooker there makes at least $50 per guy, and they often get multiple a night. They do it because, holy shit, compared to the other options they get paid like CEO of a major company.

It's really hard to know because A. we don't know how many vendors opted for unhedged/hedged escrow and paid the 3%(if I recall correctly) fee. and B. Because I don't(you know much more than me) know the volume of certain time periods. For example, I remember somebody posting either in or when the april drop occurred something along the lines of "buy now, the price on SR hasn't updated"(explanation: the on-site btc price was at ~$260, wasn't on a live update so it maintained its purchasing power, so when it crashed you could buy something that cost $260 with one bitcoin even though on all the exchanges the price was $130 so it should have taken two, so DPR had to give the vendor the difference). If enough people ordered during that time period it could have taken a MASSIVE hit. But we don't know if he killed it on the rise to $260. That's the thing we just don't know.


Yes, but we don't know if that's it. For example, how much did ross pay for all of the fake Ids? Was he ordering other things from the darknet that we don't know about? We know he was trying to get a darknet BTC exchange going with BTCKing, but we don't know how far along he was, if he was paying other people to build it up, if he had some funds somewhere that he was about to use to kick that off etc. There's just too many unknowns.

If you're heavy in the Bitcoin/Crypto scene you'll see that Litecoin is bigger here than most places. That's why places like OKCoin and to a lesser degree Huobi have unbelievably high LTC volumes, China controls way more of the LTC volume of the world than they do BTC. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 07:36:57
OKCoin definitely doesn't have the nice, polished site of Kraken. But they have way more features, way better liquidity(on the Chinese exchange, about the same on USD), and lower fees. 
@_date: 2015-05-10 03:57:03
All the Chinese exchanges want to say they are the "biggest". So whoever has the largest volume holds that title in their opinion (and apparently in opinion as well). So basically one will add 10,000 btc to their volume one day, the other will see that and 10,000 themselves. This happened with OKCoin and BitVC's futures platform earlier this year. BitVC's futures volumes more than doubled overnight for no reason, and with no volatility pickup (which is what causes a rise in volume 90% of the time), OKCoin said fuck you and went 2.5x their volume. 
Basically I'm saying it's just them going back and forth saying "we have higher volume so we're the biggest" "no, we have higher volume, *we're* the biggest."


It just means the volume is manufactured. The trades aren't fake, since they are actually going through the matching engine, it's just that the btc doesn't change ownership, so they're wash trades, and they match with their own orders in milliseconds so it's almost impossible to trade against them.

He never said everyone needs a leader. Who's pulling the strawman now? He said every society needs a leader, and to think they don't, you're being an idiot. In every facet of society, let alone every society, there are leaders and followers. This is due to one simple reason, some people are better than others. A coach leads a team because he knows more than the players. A captain leads the players because he's better than they are. A CEO leads a company. Some people can't think for themselves and need to be led. This has happened throughout history and will never change. There are leaders and followers, accept it.

Except for those predictions haven't had nearly enough time to play out so you can't say they were wrong **yet.**
Yes, mainstream adoption hasn't happened yet, but that doesn't mean that it will stay that way. You can't say that something is a flop because it hasn't done what you thought it should in your defined time frame. Otherwise I can say that Tesla is a flop in China because they had an abysmal start to 2015. 


You said Coinbase was already a flop. Why would a bunch of VCs invest money in something that has already flopped and is thus dead and not going anywhere?


So Amazon was a flop. Interesting.

Didn't link to a single comment. But I did see the top comment was this:

Future innovators of the world, not "drop out right now and change everything by tomorrow".

With Bitcoin(at a stronger stage that it is know) one party can't decide to move the market down in one day because it feels like it. However, as the decentralized network grows this will no longer be an issue. Pointing to where bitcoin is now and not recognizing the future benefits is like saying the internet can't be used for commerce because of the amount of downtime or DDoS attacks in the early days of internet.

I'm an outspoken proponent of bitcoin, I receive my salary 100% in bitcoin and have for nearly a year, but it's stuff like this that makes outsiders see us as a crazy cult. 


We are all giddy over how big the investors in Coinbase are, look at the posts saying "it's not how much they invested, but who invested", then we have a comment that's being upvoted that's saying that if they're not doing what I think is smart, then they have no idea what they're doing? How does that make any sense? These are massive companies who have gotten to where they are today precisely by knowing damn well what they're doing, and doing it very very well. 


In sum, you're saying, if investors aren't buying bitcoin, they're dumb, and if they are TO THE MOON! You don't see how that doesn't come off as cultish? It's merely another, "ok, now we have cheap coins, this time it's the bottom, and now the price is about to take off" just like it was at $600, i mean $500, well it can't go lower than $400, but $300 is the absolute bottom, the floor, it can't go any...  well i mean $200, come on that's gotta be the bottom and anybody who isn't buying is an idiot.

I mean you have to be pretty dense to not realize this by now, but that's ok, you're a special snowflake.
Lets start at the beginning, 2013: 
But the more damning proof came a couple of months ago: 
And within that thread one of OKCoin's most vocal supporters admits to seeing manufactured volume on multiple occasions: 
For their futures volume they doubled it, cause, ya know, why the fuck not: 
But lets look at someplace like BTCChina, a good respectable exchange right? Naw, even worse than OKCoin. Look at their volumes before the rally in November, OKCoin was regularly 3x higher than them. Then BTCChina decided, fuck it, turn on our bots and all of the sudden, just like that they somehow miraculously tripled their volume, and then some, and took over OKCoin by about 1.5x. Now you might ask, how could that be? Maybe a big announcement? Maybe some cool new feature? Nope. They, uh, they just wanted to. 
Anyone who still believes Chinese volumes are anything but a pissing contest between the chinese exchanges are insanely dense. 
I bet you believe the 2nd largest USD/BTC exchange in the world is iGot don't you? I mean, their reported volumes say 11,000+, more than bitstamp or coinbase. But you can't prove that it isn't their real volume so it has to be true.

Every time one of these are posted just point out that it's bullshit is what i'm going to do. I'm not complaining about the volume, i'm complaining about the misrepresentation of it being 40% of the market. Since it has 0 fees, it means jack shit. Look at the chinese exchange volumes now compared to when they were 0 fees. Bitfinex is the king exchange, without a doubt. They dominate. They have the thickest order books, the most money on margin funding, the highest legitimate volumes.

We just saw IDG invest in Circle, the chinese exchanges are to this day some of the largest and most liquid in the world. Calling this a flop is absurd. 


They have Rakuten, USAA, NYSE and tons of other amazingly impressive investors. How the hell could coinbase be considered a flop? 
Not seeing how this would be considered a flop at all. 


Didn't see anyone saying this would bring mainstream adoption and I also don't see how this would be considered a flop.


Again, this takes time. Anyone who thought that Bitcoin ATMs could be rolled out on a global scale within two years (the first bitcoin atm wasn't even out two years ago) is insane. 


How would Cyprus bring bitcoin mainstream? 
Massive utter failure, huge flop.


Don't think anyone said a trading fund would bring bitcoin mainstream, don't see how it's flopped either. 


This was released less than like 6 months ago. Again, time. Also don't see how it's considered a flop. 


Again, time. Building a decentralized market place doesn't happen overnight, if that's your expectation you're going to be disappointed by pretty much every project. 
Who said this would bring bitcoin mainstream? This affects those who want to remit to Kenya. Also, bit-pesa is what, one year old if that? M-pesa doesn't have anything to do with bitcoin.


I could see how you would consider this a flop. 


From their published stats, I could see how this would be considered a flop. But I would say that they got into the game very early and expecting them to go from a struggling company to overtaking amazon just because they accept bitcoin is delusional. 


Don't see how this a flop either. Again, no one said this would make bitcoin go mainstream. It's the combination of all the merchant adoption taking place that will help push bitcoin into the mainstream (which I do believe it is doing). 


Time. It hasn't come out so you can't really say it's flopped yet. If it came out and received no attention trading, that could be a flop. If it still isn't out in a couple years, also could be a flop. At this point i don't think it can be considered a flop. But nonetheless, I think people put way too much hope into the ETF.


It's been less than a year. What do buttcoiners think we thought they would do? Drop out of MIT and take their $100 of bitcoin and somehow make this technology mainstream in under a year. Yall have high expectations.

Actually there is, it's a debit card, that has money added to it directly from you selling your bitcoin. So yeah... that exists. 
Also, might want to look up the definition of debit:
noun: debit; plural noun: debits
an entry recording an amount owed, listed on the left-hand side or column of an account.
a payment made or owed.
verb: (of a bank or other financial organization) remove (an amount of money) from a customer's account, typically as payment for services or goods.
"$10,000 was debited from their account"
when you do a trade on an exchange, btc is debited from your account and credited to another account. So yes... just like anything else in the world, bitcoin can be debited.

out of curiosity, when you go to the gas station or grocery store, how do you pay for that? Or your average lunch?

Nice strawman. The miners didn't paint that narrative, the people trying to vilify the miners did. Look at the original reddit thread about it, the top comment points out the exact same thing I did (that the original question mentioned both viabtc and antpool)

Could be any multitude of possibilities. Perhaps the person buying is closing their short. Perhaps they're buying because they just sold $1 higher on another exchange. Perhaps they're buying because the implied usd price of ltc on the ltcbtc pair on the same exchange is a $1 higher, so you buy ltcusd, sell ltcbtc and then sell btc usd. The possibilities are endless. 
@_date: 2018-10-30 06:21:30

umm... what? This has to be one of the dumbest statements i've ever heard. You shouldn't trust someone with a little bit of your money, because they could be hacked and lose it, but you should definitely trust them with all your money... because um... yeah. 
You do realize the attack surface of an exchange is exponentially higher than that of you as an individual. Also, exchanges have a massive target painted on their back, individuals do not. Everyone knows Bitfinex is sitting on a shitload of coins, with basic opsec they shouldn't know that about you.

This whole "China does 98% of global bitcoin volume" bullshit needs to be squashed. They are 0-fee exchanges, you cannot compare their volume to the fee charging exchanges. Star Xu himself said that the volume on the chinese exchanges is inflated 5-10x due to 0-fee trading. Furthermore, it is a known fact that the chinese exchanges engage in manufacturing volume; they have orders that can't match users orders and pump massive volume through without moving the price. Anybody that has ever paid attention to the chinese volumes in the past 2 years knows this. Even the CTO of OKCoin talked about how Star Xu, the CEO, instructed the devs to create these orders and pump the volume. 
That being said, yes, china does have the most trading activity and the best liquidity. It's also dominating the derivatives markets (but again, there's volume shenanigans there and [they double count trades]( But the erroneous claims of 98% of bitcoin trading happening there need to end. 0-fee exchanges cannot be compared to fee charging exchanges simply by volume.

I know the spread is small because you can look at it on the exchange. And the spread is merely how much room there is between the best bid/ask, so the exchange doesn't make money off of that it's just the difference between the best bid/ask. 
They stay in business off of margin trading, it costs like 0.1%/day to reserve margin there and they have 5x, so they make a ton that way. They also charge 0.43%-0.28% on CNY withdrawals. Last but definitely not least, futures charges 0.03% on opening a position, free to close. So they make a lot of money off of that.

Use SALT to get a loan if you need one. 
I'm not sticking my head in the sand and saying everything is perfect, but it's extremely easy to live with a btc salary and i'm not going to be changing that anytime soon. It's basically dollar cost averaging your entry into bitcoin, which is one of the best ways to invest.

There's a spread just like on any other exchange, but it's not like the exchanges make money of the spread. They're zero-fee because in 2013 BTCChina did a 0-fee promotion leading the others to follow. Later okcoin and huobi tried to go back to fees, but leon li (ceo of huobi) insisted he would never go back, so to stay competitive the other two buckled and went back to 0fees. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 00:19:49
1. The lawyers got to choose a date at random. How would bitfinex have been able to sell crypto to fit the bank balance on an unknown date in the past
2. What do you mean by "legit"? And we have a pretty reasonable idea of how it got there.
3. If you really believe all the tether bullshit you probably aren't a trader or are a really small one at that who just got involved in crypto and thinks he knows everything about the space. All the big desks used the shit out of tether to arb bitfinex and other exchanges.

No, i definitely understand. If you're a taker, you're paying higher fees to the exchanges (good for them); you're crossing the spread to hit the market makers orders (good for them, as that's how they make money); your flow is very soft, i.e., non-toxic, so it's not like your crossing the spread to run them over, you don't have better market insight than the MMs, so they get soft flow (good for them). 
A market needs takers and makers, there are plenty of market makers (legit market makers, not retail like 99.999% of people in this sub, e.g., Jump, Jane street, Flow Traders, Alameda etc.), Coinbase needs more people to cross the spread. That's why they're making these fee changes.

I don't think clearly labeling your wallet bitcoin cash is deceptive, but for the sake of argument I can see why you think bitcoin cash is trying to deceive users, like the post on how bch is actually bitcoin, so I'll cede this. 


So let me get this right? Miners only follow price. But when mining a more profitable chain and therefore following price, it's an attack. That seems like flawed logic. Wouldn't a rational miner mine the more profitable chain? Even if you measure profits in btc and not usd, rational miners would mine bch and sell it for btc to maximize their btc gains. So you're expecting miners to mine btc out of charity against their self interests? That doesn't seem like a long term viable, trust less system. 
. All you have there is some charlatan developers and few wealthy con-artists
Idk about you but pretty much all of the og bitcoiners I know support bch. Cumberland mining's founder, bch. Jihan (2010) bch. Star Xu (2012) bch. Gavin (2009) bch. Garzik, bch. Roger, bch. Oliver, bch. Sure Mike hearn would be bch as well. Bitpay looks to be going down the bch route and I think we can expect coinbase to do the same. Wouldn't be surprised at all if xapo does as well. In fact the only early players I can think of against bch is loaded and theymos.

But we aren't, we are talking about different cultures and different levels of tech penetration.

So while we may use credit cards we still do it in a shitty fashion since we don't have better choices due to lack of tech penetration. In China, it's not exactly a personal choice merely because everyone around you uses wechat pay, so you kinda have to as well

Don't have to download the app, just use the website. If you knew you're going to the Philippines why didn't you do this before hand? Sign up, verify email, literally 45-60 seconds. Stand in line to buy SIM card (wouldn't you have to stand in line to convert money) isn't always a necessity (I didn't have to wait in a line last time I went). Not sure on verification but don't think they need a passport or anything besides name/addy, and again, why wouldn't you do this beforehand. Send Bitcoin, again, why wouldn't you have already done this??? Find where you can get cash out, you mean like the atm 20 feet from where you got the SIM card? Figure out how to get there, you mean by walking 20 feet?

But you're saying that if the amount of full nodes is small (in comparison to what, total users? in comparison to users who run full nodes trying to change the consensus rules?) then it's easy to change the rules of bitcoin. That would mean that bitcoin is easily sybil attacked, and that's not the case. If all it requires is a small amount (again, compared to what) of nodes to maintain status quo and a big amount of nodes to change the consensus rules, than anybody could just spin up thousands of nodes and sybil attack the chain.

I don't think you've had the full authentic bitcoin experience if you didn't think about trying to mine it at some point; contemplating whether or not you should preorder a jalapeno from BFL, after all you'll get it in two weeks; looking up how to set up a GPU mining rig; checking out all the super legit, guaranteed to profit, great cloud mining contracts. 


and this is pretty much always the conclusion. 


Help it, work for a bitcoin company, use bitcoin for purchases and support companies that accept bitcoin. I've received my salary 100% in bitcoin for over 2 and 1/2 years now. I book all my flights and hotels with bitcoin, buy all my electronics from amazon through egifter, support artists that accept bitcoin like gramatik. And after using bitcoin as much as I do i've very confident it will take off.

This subreddit constantly espouses "bitcoin isn't made for you to buy coffee with" and constantly derides those who view it as a currency and even say that those spending are negatively affecting the market as it puts downward pressure on the price. Gmax has repeatedly talked about how using credit cards is a much better option than spending btc. And since the blocksize debate one constantly sees people suggesting litecoin as the crypto one should use if they want to make payments. You yourself have said countless times how btc is a settlement layer not meant for day to day payments, yet here you are talking about using it for day to day payments with *onchain transactions* (purse isn't set up for lightning), and be realistic, currently you can't use lightning to buy much at all besides novelty items.

@_date: 2019-01-09 02:34:56
The most shorted stock in the market is tesla where it peaked with ~$10.7bn in shorts, so $1bn would be ~10% increase on *the most shorted stock in the entire market*, no exchange would allow for that. They wouldn't allow any of those shorts to close $1bn of their position in one trade either, if you think they would, you're delusional. 


Bitcoin trades more and is more liquid than many stocks on the NYSE. At the peak of the bubble crypto volumes were equivalent to the entire NYSE. There's a reason Nasdaq, ICE (parent company of NYSE), CBOE, CME, Eris Exchange, are all rolling out crypto offerings (hint: it's not because nobody trades them and there's no volume)

I never said profit for the company would be down 80%
Many crypto companies stock has been slammed since their ipo. And I'd love to see your data around major companies' stock "significant increases" since announcing they announced crypto.
Where did I ever bring up dividends. If a shareholder sees an investment their company made down 80% thereby completely erasing all profit from those sales and making them actually losses for the company (no conversions mean none of the money spent on coffee would be sent to suppliers, so you'd not only reduce profit but actually take a loss on every coffee sold) they would not be happy
Lastly, thats called speculation. I bet you said the price would rise significantly from bakkt and its tanked since their announcement... There's no way they would take that risk. I suspect they would need to clear it with regulators and shareholders beforehand and I highly doubt it would fly.

because luno barely holds any funds and they aren't a regulated custodian. When you actually have more than a few btc, the risks involved with overhauling your wallet software are much more severe. You also have to make sure that any changes made are ok with regulators. Luno doesn't have those concerns and so are able to be much more nimble with their operations.
@_date: 2019-01-08 08:36:38

and of course many people did hear about it back then and didn't give it a second. One of the top questions in an ask reddit thread in 2014 about what would you do if you woke up on jan 1st 2013 was "buy bitcoin" and there were tons of responses from people talking about how they heard about it, or had a friend who told them, or tried to mine it and just didn't deal with the hassle. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 03:12:53


no, you can't. There are circuit breakers in place to prevent flash crashes and market manipulation. There is no way you could execute a single trade amounting to &gt;15% of a stocks total traded volume. 


Would drop the price *on that exchange*, we saw a flash crash on coinbase just last month where eth went to $10, yet on every other exchange it barely budged. so using one exchange to say that it would destroy the price of the asset is inaccurate. On Bitfinex, a much more liquid exchange, a $40m sell would drop the price to ~$3000, still a lot, but not nearly as much. If we aggregate liquidity across exchanges (as is required by regulations in traditional assets due to best price execution laws) it'd be much less than that. Not to mention OTC trading. 
If you'd like to short $40mm, you could also use a derivatives exchange such as Bitmex where such a trade would only cause the price to go down 2.5%, so you can cherry pick certain order books, but it's just that... cherry picking. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 01:51:19

Ah of course, the super convenient method of having to go meet someone (hoping someone is in your area) and then paying them cash. And if you want to do a large trade, you're fucked. The exchanges are all on the shitlist, the otc desks (genesis (dcg) and cumberland (founder loves bch) are also on your shit list i assume. So just keep alienating all the companies in the space until you have none left. Sounds like a great idea.

The price on one exchange is higher than the other, you sell and now you have fiat. You need to move that fiat to the exchange with the lower price. That's arbitrage. You have to be able to move both sides of the trade. Shorting on one exchange is not arbitrage

So greg either a) gets what he wants from both users and miners and nothing changes, b) gets support from some users but not miners, so he supports changing the pow (2x currently has &gt;90% hashrate) or c) he doesn't have the support of users or miners, and he quits.

Except for tragedy of the commons refers to one shared-resource that can't be sustained if everyone uses it. By having companies like coinbase and cumberland it adds utility to bitcoin and helps sustain the bitcoin economy, it's the opposite of tragedy of the commons. Instead of them taking from something that is shared, they are giving something of value to the shared resource.

Small traders are almost always less familiar/skilled in trading, leading to more support tickets, issues, complaints, social media rants etc, and 99.9% of the time, it's just because the user doesn't know what they're doing. And exchanges have to handle all of that for very little money. Why would you want that when you could offer better support to high value customers who make your business what it is since you don't have to deal with smaller traders?

That is also wrong. BU is not in beta. In fact, core is still in beta, hence the 0.14.1 and not 1.14.1, while bu came out of beta and had their first production release shortly before all the bugs started popping up.

The problem with this though, is that old deposit addresses can be compromised and people will still send to them and the hacker sweeps to his own address, just like what happened with bitfinex. They had a multi-sig cold wallet, but not for their deposit addresses, when they were hacked any coins sent to those addresses were swept to the hackers control. Now they use multi-sig deposit addresses for everyone.

The amount of bitcoin actually being traded on Chinese exchanges is way less than that of BitFinex, Coinbase, BitStamp and the rest of the USD exchanges combined. The number seems big, but that's only because they don't charge any fees on their CNY pair. The volumes have gone up, but the users have gone down; as the bitcoin price goes down in China it loses more and more users since the only thing to do with bitcoin in China is gamble. There is no merchant adoption.  BitFinex has been leading the price action of the last rally.

I very strongly doubt that. Alibaba has its own payment system, Alipay, which it wants to keep its users using. It also can't technically touch bitcoin because financial institutions in China can't touch it and Alibaba is opening a bank, which is of course a financial institution. And of course, without the green light from the government which I don't see happening, Alibaba isn't going to do anything in a grey area, especially since the government is already scrutinizing them very hard.

OKCoin can withdrawal to pretty much all the chinese banks and charge 0.43%-0.28% for the withdrawal. There are 0 trade fees so it wouldn't cost anything to sell the bitcoin, so the fees in total would be 0.43%-0.28%.

You don't understand how difficulty retargeting works do you? It isn't set at 2 weeks. It's set by how many blocks you mine. If bitmain stopped mining youd have to wait until all the blocks before the difficulty retargeting takes place, which with a good portion of the hashrate (if you believe this sub over 60%) not mining would take a long time, much longer than two weeks.

Yeah, we trade with miners, other desks, other traders, retail brokerages, fx brokerages, a wide range of clients. But we source a lot of liquidity for the trades from the exchanges (like if a miner sells to us, we'll hedge immediately on exchanges). You also want to internalize flow, but don't want to hold on to risk, so it's a balance of having otc flow move you out of risk and moving out of risk yourself on the exchanges. 


If there's an arb opportunity sure, but the idea that people buy otc which doesn't move the market and then sell on exchanges and move the market is incorrect. OTC would have less of an impact on the price, but it isn't 0 impact by any means. 


It doesn't... people just don't understand markets and always point at some boogeyman of manipulation.
@_date: 2018-12-20 06:12:07
OTC desks source liquidity from the exchanges, so there's always supply to be had. Saying they can't fill orders due to lack of supply would just mean it's a really shitty otc desk. 


No, no no no, no no no no no. I don't know how the fuck this stupid idea became commonplace in crypto, but buying a large amount would cost *more* than a small amount, not a discount. You can't go to goldman sachs and say "hey, i'd love to buy a lot of EURUSD, but 5% below market", they'd laugh you out of the room, i don't know why people think you can do it in bitcoin/crypto. The larger the trade, the more the funding costs are, the higher the price risk is, the higher the settlement/counterparty risk is, so it's going to incur more slippage and would be sold at a _premium_ to the market. No decent otc desk would _ever_ sell bitcoin at a discount, why would they? They could just go and sell it at market rates on the exchanges or with other desks. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 12:37:26
Then just take my opinion at face value, don't appeal to authority just because of my occupation. I provided information in subsequent comments about how an otc desk would always be able to source liquidity from exchanges or other desks, there's no such thing as "not being able to find a seller" for a trading firm. If there weren't enough sellers, the price would go up until the point where people would be willing to sell, it's basic supply and demand and markets 101

How is it convoluted? Go to an ATM and buy bitcoins, send a picture of the QR code to the recipient, they go to an atm scan the barcode and receive cash.

Two questions for you. 
1. How are Chinese laundering money to the US using bitcoin if America isn't allowing people to move a lot of money with BTC? Edit: Or even have a lot of money in BTC held in America(as that would have already been made illegal)
2. The Chinese are getting more and more fed up with the USD being the reserve currency in the world and are doing everything they can to move away from it. What is going to make them change this idea and start reinforcing it by putting their own money in it?
Just a couple of other things to point out. America pressures Singapore to release tax information. Doesn't matter. Also, as China becomes more and more powerful US will start to lose its ability to say "conform to our ways or we won't deal with you." This is already happening.
What I'm much more worried about is a government wanting to rid the world of BTC so they build unbelievably powerful miners and 51% attack the system. 
Edit: One other question:
How does America enforce this? How do they find out whether this wallet belongs to an American, or not? As they would have to do this for *every* wallet the sheer amount of detective work to bust people is not feasible. Example: US finds a huge wallet(illegal) and starts chasing it down. Hours of investigating later they find out it is some dude in Yemen's wallet. What now? Yemen dude now creates a new wallet, tumbles his coins, and sends half to the new wallet(still large enough to be illegal). US see's this new wallet get created and funded so they investigate... son of a bitch, days later they find out it's the same guy. At what point does this become a waste of time?

I disagree strongly with this. China has a strong culture of saving because they don't have welfare to fall back on or anything like that. Bobby Lee(CEO of BTC-China) mentioned this in one of his latest interviews. Furthermore, Peter Lighte, the founder of JP-Morgan in Beijing had said at a panel titled "China, Bank of the World" that the chinese have a very strong "save" mindset and tend to save 40% of their income(I don't have a source I can link you to on this, however) for the reasons mentioned above.

They might not have an intrinsic value, but I can use them to purchase things that do(in fact, last night a guy in Hong Kong paid for our first round in Beijing at the bar Second Place with Bitcoin). A dollar bill has no intrinsic value besides the paper it's printed on. If you look at it like the only value it has is to invest/speculate in it, than buying bitcoin would be pure speculation. But, it is used every day to buy things online and in stores, to send money across the world with little to no fees or transfer limits. So it has value in what it enables you to do, more so than a dollar bill.

No, it's the exact opposite. It has 0 consumer protection(once you give the merchant your money, the transaction is done, you can't issue a charge back). Ask those who ordered from BFL if the merchant is protected or if they are. 


This is hard to argue for the time being. But I see that changing. But, from a merchants point of view, bitcoin is better. 1% fees instead of 2-5% charged from credit cards without the threat of charge backs. 


According to who? .0001 is the standard transaction fee x 500=$.05 


I don't know enough about it to form an opinion, but I did see the e-gold site that went out of business and said that bitcoin is better than them in every way and they encouraged their customers to switch over to bitcoin.


Do you mean those that are buying it for spending? And if so, that doesn't make you a sucker, it just means you prefer to use that method of payment. If you look at how much you *could* have made if you didn't spend bitcoin then yes, it might not be viewed as wise. But hindsight is 20-20.

I'm moving to China for a year on wednesday. What do you think are some good ideas to drum up support for bitcoin? 
I don't think that because Chinese are reluctant to use credit, means that they're reluctant to using btc. They don't like debt. When you use a credit card, you're putting yourself in debt. BTC is even farther away from cash, which is debt on the government's end, in that the bitcoin itself is worth something. It's very similar to cash, just can't be taken away, which I think is the real attraction to BTC for the Chinese.

I went to one located inside a grocery store once and they told me I had to go somewhere else because they didn't have enough cash there. It goes both ways. 
ATM fee is prolly going to be around 3-5%(although I think it'll get lower as more businesses make them). That's still quite a bit less than western union. I'm not sure what transmission fee you're talking about though.

Tracking bitcoin purchases and tracking bitcoin are 100% different. It is not feasible because I can create a new wallet every second, the government can't find out who that wallet belongs to in a second. If I send money to a new address nobody knows if that address is mine or not. The only way they can find out is when I turn that BTC into cash. Or, I use an exchange with a bank account in a country that doesn't abide by American tax laws and don't release tax information. Or use a bank account in a nation in which I could use a fake name. 


Within the US. They can't force a merchant outside of the US to do anything. China is the perfect example of this; all the ripped off movies and tv shows that are on youku or tudou here. Or making the central bank release their grip on the RMB, which America cares about 10,000 times more than BTC. They can't force them to do either of these things because we *can't*.


People can create their own tumblers. Or they could host a tumbler on tor... Outlawing things doesn't kill them; drugs. 


And who do they force this on? The Bitcoin source code? They can't force a company outside of America to give them all their receipts to check if an American used bitcoin at their store. They can't change bitcoin. So they can only do this within the US as well.


Post-911. 9/11 was a *pretty big* catalyst. Maybe if something came up where it was discovered that terrorists relied heavily on bitcoin it could have an equal reaction, otherwise it's irrelevant since there isn't such a big disaster tied to it. Furthermore, US has lost A LOT of its power since 2001. We're a laughing stock right now. We can't tell anyone to do anything. Our president didn't go to crucial meetings in Asia(where the financial market is heading) and let China spread its influence farther. We can't keep our own country running. More and more is coming out about how we're spying on our allies' leaders. We're not in a position to call shots right now, especially on something like outlawing a currency throughout the world; infringing on merchants rights in EVERY nation; and infringing on citizens rights in EVERY nation. 


It will have to be. Regulated does not mean shut down/kill. While you present some interesting points, you are looking at bitcoin as if it's American. It isn't. It's global. America is losing its hegemony and China is splitting the globe. If they see it as beneficial, which I believe they do, it doesn't matter what America thinks.

This is where I see you running into a problem. Lets say this thing blows the fudge up and everyone wants to use it. Are they going to have to wait two weeks for verification like many had to Mt. Gox? If so, that kind of defeats the convenience of an ATM.
Also, while the palm scanner sounds more intrusive, it is actually not intrusive at all. The palm scan doesn't get sent to a government agency or anything like that, it stays on the machine and just makes sure that the person doesn't transact more than the $3000 limit.

3. they don't get approval but they do it anyway. And no, the government knows all about it. They sit outside of subway stations, cops see them and just walk right on by. They don't give a shit. 
4. Or they could use a foreign host in the same way Beijing Cream and Chinasmack does. They aren't blocked from the internet, and don't have to report to anyone.

I think what needs to happen for this is wider adoption and more things priced solely in BTC(which requires a more stable price). Otherwise it's all relative. For instance, I'm living in China, but from the US, and so I think 1USD=6CNY. I don't price things in USD because it would make no sense--no one accepts it-- so I convert it to the currency I can use. So, when we get to the point where we can widely use BTC it will be much easier to make the switch you mentioned.

Those that I know are way better off than the average chinese person. Your perception of the average person in China is way off. A lot of Chinese have never even seen a foreigner, let alone have reason to send money to a foreign country. The average Chinese person ears $2,100/month. They don't care about the government, they don't care about foreigners, they care about providing for their family, of which about half still live below the poverty line. To allude to factory girls(by leslie chang, really good book btw) she's talking about an a migrant worker, who represents a common character in China today, and the girl asks "Who is the Mao Zedong today?" asking who the leader is. She couldn't care less about politics, as long as she can go find work--which the government doesn't restrict--she's fine with it. This represents a massive percentage of the Chinese population.

I live in China so I feel like I'm qualified to comment on this. I bought bitcoins before I came here using USD, went to a cafe, sold bitcoins for CNY. No politics, 0% fee(quite literally), and not complicated at all. 


Bitcoin does nothing more to break these rules than WU, it just doesn't charge fees. Buy at location A using btc, send to location B, pull out money at storefront or ATM. Same thing would happen using WU.


Nobody is saying this. They're saying that it will take away the massive fees charged by companies like WU while doing the exact same thing. The customer would still have to abide by local regulations whether using BTC or WU.

@_date: 2013-11-09 08:48:54
There are so many flaws with this.


Really? I had my credit card locked on me a week ago because I used it in China and, despite being notified, they thought it was a fraudulent charge. Also, have you traveled much? VERY few places in Asia accept credit cards. Fewer accept bitcoin, true, but it is much easier for them to start to accept bitcoin than a credit card, and the fees are MUCH lower(1% bitpay vs 3-4% for credit cards)


I call bullshit. Your bank actually refunds you the fee that ATMs charge? I highly doubt that. 


For this reason many vendors dislike credit cards because you can claim a chargeback, even if there isn't a legitimate reason and give them all kinds of problems. In the end they might end up with the money but it will take time and is a hassle. 


As others mentioned, you're lucky to live in a place that has a set up such as yours. You're using the best banking system in the world, or one of, and the VAST majority of the world population don't have that.
You're also failing to look at many of the other things that are much better about bitcoin than fiat. Money transfers most namely. Anonymity is another one for people with shady governments. The fact that it can't be seized. It's deflationary and not inflationary. There are more, but I'll stop here cause I think you get the point. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:20:21

The "very few retailers accept it" is already becoming false. Bitspend has over 10,000 merchants and shopify has 60,000 I believe, plus all of the retail companies' gift cards you can buy on gyft. So, without including brick and mortar shops or even gyft, we have over 70,000 places accepting it. How is that very few? And this is all over the course of a couple years.

I made a typo, maximum, not minimum "Chinese banks will not allow you to exchange and wire overseas any amount over the RMB equivalent of US$500 for you without SAFE approval, and if there is no tax paid receipts (employers should provide this) or no work permit or visa, this route is barred."
Source:  as well as actually living here, I feel like I have a better idea of what one can do here than you. 


Do you have any idea how many people don't trust banks and keep there money in cash at home?("All told, more than 2.5 billion adults around the world—about half—are unbanked, according to a new World Bank data project funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and based on Gallup polling in 148 countries") You might only be able to think about you're little tiny world in a first world country, but hey, guess what, there are other people in this world who don't have amazing banking infrastructure in their country. So you go on the attack and end up just looking like a closed minded idiot. Do you know how many people in China don't put money in the banks, but rather keep cash for a multitude of reasons? Stop thinking the world revolves around a single country, maybe travel, see more of the world, it's not all first world countries out there. 


Ever heard of localbitcoins.com? They got hacked and reimbursed their users out of their own funds. 


Alright fine. I use TAILS, which dumps its memory, install electrum on a persistent drive, and then what are you going to do? You can't do shit. Even if you have a keystroke reader, I can use the onscreen keyboard. So, tell me again how easy it is to steal my bitcoins.
Edit: I assume you're from American since other countries' citizens realize that there's more out there than just their country. "821,000 households opted out of the banking system from 2009 to 2011 and that the so-called unbanked population grew to 8.2 percent of U.S. households." So one in 13 households don't use a bank, where the fuck do you think they keep their money? I'd guess in their house. Not everybody uses a bank dipshit. 
Edit 2: "Not if you keep your money in your bank. It's really fucking stupid arguments like that that bitcoin advocates make that make put me off and think they're all stupid."
It's really fucking stupid statements like that, that make other people think Americans are all self-centered ignorant fools. Please stop making us look bad. Before you speak remember there are over 7 billion people in this world, not 300 million and not all of them have the same advantages we do.

No, it's the exact opposite. It has 0 consumer protection(once you give the merchant your money, the transaction is done, you can't issue a charge back). Ask those who ordered from BFL if the merchant is protected or if they are. 


This is hard to argue for the time being. But I see that changing. But, from a merchants point of view, bitcoin is better. 1% fees instead of 2-5% charged from credit cards without the threat of charge backs. 


According to who? .0001 is the standard transaction fee x 500=$.05 


I don't know enough about it to form an opinion, but I did see the e-gold site that went out of business and said that bitcoin is better than them in every way and they encouraged their customers to switch over to bitcoin.


Do you mean those that are buying it for spending? And if so, that doesn't make you a sucker, it just means you prefer to use that method of payment. If you look at how much you *could* have made if you didn't spend bitcoin then yes, it might not be viewed as wise. But hindsight is 20-20.

If you go by single attacks(hiroshima is one attack, nagasaki is one attack etc.) the Tokyo Fire bombings were actually more disastrous with a higher death toll than hiroshima or nagasaki. And the death tolls of Hiroshima and nagasaki aren't quite as high as one would think, ~200,000 killed.

Having children is limited, you are correct about that. However it is still common in china to have multiple children. And this is mostly limited to the Han population living in major cities. Both of my tutors here have multiple siblings, one from a family of 5 and one a family of 4. 
The hukou system has almost completely been abandoned. The largest migration in history has taken place in china as migrant workers have moved to the cities for jobs. Factory girls does a perfect job of explaining this as she talks about migrant workers. There are very few restrictions on people moving these days, if any. 
The average Chinese person can and does speak freely about politics. They can't say this in the press for the most part, but what average Chinese person goes to the press to debate politics? This doesn't affect the average Chinese person
Only half of the Chinese population has access to Internet, again, not really affecting the average Chinese person. Furthermore, they can get a VPN quite easily and access any website they want to. And i doubt the legitimacy of your 3/4 statistic. Blogs, Facebook, YouTube, and twitter are blocked, that's about it. All of which have a Chinese version that are more than sufficient for the vast majority of Chinese Internet users. 
Again, a minority need to send money overseas. This doesn't affect the average Chinese person.

1. Yes, that is correct. Out of curiosity how many 3rd party presidents have we had in America? None. You can create your own party in America but it won't mean anything. 
2. They approve a wide reach of publications, or just ignore many others, look at beijingcream.com and chinasmack.com for examples of less than pro-china news sites here.
3. I take it you've never been to china... There are book and DVD stands selling whatever they so please on the side of the road every day. No permission from anyone. 
4. And? What's your point?
5. Which does about shit all from stopping people. Use a VPN, everyone I know who lives here does including tons of Chinese people

True, however, like you stated, you have to trust that they don't do this. Also, theoretically, once the US issues a court order instructing them to log one persons activity, they would have to do so. But, I'd rather just use a provider outside of the US to eliminate a worry of them having to comply to US law.

I didn't hear anything about a bitcoin ATM, but I did hear about a brick and mortar shop that sells btc in texas.

It's doing ok. The average person still hasn't heard about it, but remember, not even half of China's population has access to internet. There was a bitcoin meetup in Shanghai the other day with I think 95 attendees and one in Beijing a week ago with I think about 40 or so. 
Few places accept bitcoin, but more and more are starting to. It's seen more as a store of value than a currency I would say. It's also a way for chinese to move money out of CNY and into GBP, USD, Euro, etc. I think it has a bright future in China though and am excited to see where it will be in a year from now.

I would say because we want to be able to use our Bitcoins for daily transactions but influential people that misunderstand Bitcoin scare merchants away from using it. It's the equivalent of if a computer company didn't allow linux to run on their products; those that want to use linux would probably try to get them to adopt it, that way they can use their favorite OS.
Example: I tried to get a company to accept bitcoin and this was the response I got 
"Yeah, I've looked at Bitcoin. Wish to heck I'd bought in a year ago! My problem with it is that we hold various US Federal licenses, and we get looked at pretty hard by multiple gov't agencies quarterly. Add to that I am an Arab-American, in the tobacco business, who imports often from the Middle-East, and I feel it's a little bit like waving an additional red flag. We go out of our way to be compliant and transparent, and Bitcoin does not fit that profile."
I feel like if more influential people, such as Peter Schiff, didn't put out misinformation this merchant would realize bitcoin is more transparent than cash and very easy to be compliant.

I showed you an example of said who did exactly what you asked for. "are declining profits in the name of instigating social change." He doesn't collect a salary... he's literally declining profits.

Why are credit cards obviously easier? They're more expensive for the merchants. If you're abroad your credit card can be frozen for fear of fraudulent transactions at any time. I can scan a qr code with my phone and I'm done. That's not hard by any stretch of imagination.


I doubt any store would accept gold. If you have an example, I'd love to see it. They don't know if the gold is pure, or even real. They'd have to have a scale to know the exact weight. I have never seen a store that accepts gold. 


Have you ever paid with bitcoin? It takes a tablet/computer/smart phone on the merchant side, and same with the customer. If you integrate bitpay, it converts the bitcoin to your currency at the time of transaction and deposits it in your bank. That all takes very little time, resources, or effort. It'd actually take much more effort to set up a system that accepts credit cards.

A wire transfer is not better for many reasons. It takes 2-3 days, often times longer. It has the fee, which you mentioned. Plus there are often minimum amounts for wire transfers, and sort of maximums(if you send $100,000 people are going to ask questions). 
I would say can't be frozen is an advantage. I'm in China and need money to live, but the bank says they're waiting for (insert reason here) to release the funds. 


And somebody breaking into my house and stealing all my cash is a risk of fiat. I can keep my bitcoin on a usb drive and then it would be safe. Or if I use bip-32 they would still be fucked. I could also encrypt my wallet files with pgp, or another form of encryption to protect myself.
However, you are correct, better is subjective and I can definitely see instances in which a wire transfer would be better.

But that wasn't people investing in it. That was banks. The average consumer had no way to defend against that. You could defend yourself against tulips by not buying tulips, bitcoins by not buying bitcoins, there was no way for the average consumer to defend/protect themselves against that.

Don't be so definitive, leave yourself some wiggle room. *about* two weeks, that way if, you know, by some odd chance, it takes *slightly* longer you didn't actually give a date.

Whelp, that's all I needed to read. Let me just set my computer to math solving mode.
