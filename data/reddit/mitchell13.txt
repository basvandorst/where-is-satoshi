So all commerce needs to be completely unregulated for a country to be considered free?

So if I were to sell grocery bags full of Euros out of the trunk of my car, you'd consider this a legitimate business as well?
You're also aware that every remotely developed country on earth regulates the sale of currency?

I'm not trying to make you upset, I just thought this was an unnecessary distinction to make.

When did FinCen say that Bitcoin isn't a currency?  According to [this]( it sounds to me like it is considered a currency for all practical purposes.

Commerce is an activity that takes place between people, so commerce would fall under your definition of "people and their behavior that are regulated".  Your claim that commerce isn't regulated doesn't really work even with your views.  I'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish by defining commerce simply as a "thing".

Except, you aren't necessarily correcting a system inefficiency.  For instance,  if someone breaks into your house and steals your belongings and sells them on the street are they correcting a system inefficiency?  If Mt. Gox is found out to have simply stolen millions of dollars worth of coins from its users is that correcting a system inefficiency?

Your local shop owner likely has all the proper licenses and permits to do business, and isn't dealing in currency which involves much stricter laws.

I understood exactly what you were saying.  I asked you directly if you believed any regulation made a person not free and you dodged the question by vaguely defining commerce as a "thing".  That's all.

Like with pretty much everything else, as long as you don't try to make it a business you're fine.  Marking up the coins 20% and doing hundreds of transactions makes you a money transmitter that needs to be licensed.

Well for starters, you completely ignored my other example which is very relevant to Bitcoin.  Second, why would we assume that a person came across the goods they're selling legally?  If you have to pretend that theft and other criminal activity doesn't exist for your point to make sense then you're not making a very realistic argument.  Obviously, if we're in some fantasy world where criminal activity doesn't exist then we won't need any laws to deter it.  Your original point was that actions are always justified if they make a profit.  Not very realistic.


Again, there's no proof that you're actually more efficient than the other money changers.  The other money changers are licensed and have to prove the money isn't stolen.  You don't and can charge better rates.  That's not really better efficiency, you could just be running some sort of Bitcoin theft operation (which is hurting system efficiency).

Like it or not, legitimate businesses have to be licensed.  Buying bitcoins off the exchanges, marking them up 20%, and reselling them without a license is illegal and not really a legitimate business.

How is it not a currency?  For any practical purpose, it sounds like FinCen considers it a currency to me.  Also, they're pretty clear about businesses that exchange virtual currencies being regulated accordingly.  In the US, Bitcoin is regulated just like any other currency.  I don't know where people are getting the idea that it's not a recognized currency and is unregulated.
