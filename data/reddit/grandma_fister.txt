Does that have any real effect on the cryptocurrencies itself or is it just horse betting?

Except for when your GPU is burned out a few years earlier than you expected.

Well, ours costs approximately 29cents per kwh. I think that's not profitable.
Thanks for the tip though, I'd really like to mine if I ever move somewhere else.

Sorry, what exactly is that and what are the implications? I'm not american.

I mean as I mentioned, I'd be all for no taxes but I see no sources or links in the article to support their statements. Guess I'll have to do some research again.

Pretty sure it's not zero, but just less.

I don't know, electricity is a bit more expensive here and other parts also wear and tear. Not sure it would be worth it.
I'm not into AAA games so my old 6950 served me well on full HD settings until last year,

Huh ok. I haven't had that much disposable income yet. I usually keep mine 6 years or so.

Ok, I understood that. Thanks for explaining it. I hope no big players try to lower BTCs price..

I asked a Steuerberater a year back and she said Wertanlagen don't reach zero taxes. But please prove me wrong, I'd very much welcome the opposite!

I have the same question. It would be nice if someone with knowledge could answer this.
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:31:52
Sorry, I don't quite understand that yet. I personally own a Ledger and as far as I know, there is no support for B2X yet. So if they don't update it would be better to move my BTC back to coinbase until the split?
@_date: 2017-11-04 09:23:31
Ok, thanks for taking the time to explain that to me!
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:25:55
Sure thing bro, I'll let you know if I get a reply.

I hate when big companies try to fuck over the small guys. Tried asking them via Twitter, maybe they have an active PR team..

Sorry, this user told me otherwise, is his information incorrect?

Hm, do you know how to check your transactions from coinbase on that site? The reference of my bought BTC and my wallet don't yield any results on bitchair..
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:58:28
Wait, can't you just cancel that order then?
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:00:33
Does it make a difference if I have a Ledger Nano?
@_date: 2017-09-01 10:05:13
Good explanation, a question though: the way I did it so far was transferring money from my bank account to coinbase which takes two days. Then I check the app regularly and when I see a good price in the app, say 4300 and want to buy BTC at that, it usually tells me a way higher price, like "Buying BTC at 4390". Is that normal?
@_date: 2017-09-01 19:29:06
Ok, was just wondering if the refresh rate is funky or they just want to make a bit more bank.
If I buy from gdax, it goes in the same wallet that coinbase uses?

Thank you!
@_date: 2017-09-02 06:43:44
Thanks for the answer man!
@_date: 2017-09-01 21:06:22
The transaction fees I guess. What exactly do you mean with paper wallet? I'm quite new to this.
