Historically, they've released updates around 5pm Japan Time. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 01:35:13
Thanks. That really clears it up for me. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:05:18
This is true. Do you think people are panic buying right now?
@_date: 2013-03-27 23:13:33
No. BTC has a fixed amount that will all be theoretically mined within the next 100 years or so. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 02:02:03
Have you noticed that they increase the cash deposit fee each time you deposit? 
@_date: 2013-11-17 21:02:45
Localbitcoins. Sell in person, get cash, profit. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:04:46
This is dangerous thinking. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:08:01
but why would anyone buy bitcoin at 1000$ USD? (serious question)
@_date: 2013-04-02 19:07:50
Find friends or people in your local area to buy from. You don't have to wait on MtGox. Even craigslist has adds for people willing to sell bitcoin - at least in my area.

edit 810!
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:59:15
Why is bitcoin the ride and not another crypto-currency like litecoin or something else? 
@_date: 2013-04-02 20:20:36
if it hit four figures i would probably have a heart attack. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 18:54:40
Tons of people are still buying
@_date: 2013-04-02 19:02:04
Do it now, or kick yourself later when the price is much higher. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:55:01
NO. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 02:51:30
It's going up too fast. I'm getting uncomfortable. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 02:00:40
Have you noticed that bitfloor seems to increase their cash deposit fee each time you request a new deposit? 
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:27:46
I totally agree with you, but surely there is a fair amount of cognitive psychology at play in economics and finance. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 20:08:34
Reconsider please. It would be much better if you flooded my wallet directly. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 16:00:45
They didn't get on board early on and now they just want to see it burn. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:53:09
wow. did not know that! 
@_date: 2013-04-02 15:59:11
I feel this pain. You aren't alone. I think we just need to hop on the bandwagon as soon as possible and forget about how much more we "could have made".
@_date: 2013-04-03 02:58:44
but will it pop at 130 or 230 or 500? Is there any good reason to believe the bubble will pop sooner rather than later??
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:42:13
it'll be back. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 02:57:06
It's rising too fast. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:24:06
It was 900
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:54:12
Just buy some already. If btc actually goes viral then they will inevitably trade for 10s of thousands of usd per coin. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 17:55:29
Don't do it. We are nearing an all time high. Take a breather and read everything you can about bitcoin. Learn about your investment and only exchange what you are willing to lose. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:13:41
It will probably go up. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 19:06:56
The market keeps growing. More people are buying bitcoins now than ever. MtGox verifies 1000+ new accounts a day. More businesses are accepting bitcoin each day. Security on btc markets keeps improving. Faith in USD and the Euro isn't increasing. Is bitcoin a bubble? Yes. Will it go down significantly in the near future. Probably not. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 02:15:02
This makes sense. Thanks. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:47:30
this was a perfect response. :)
@_date: 2013-04-02 19:42:51
1's and 0's. I get it. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 01:44:53
You seem lost. Head back to or @_date: 2013-04-02 18:52:34
When is it going to end??
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:24:17
As much as I want bitcoin to succeed, it's impossible for me to believe that i'll be a millionaire by the end of this decade simply because I bought a dozen bitcoins back in 2013 and held on to them.
