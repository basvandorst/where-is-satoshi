When shit hits the fan? My friend, you have not seen shit hitting the fan. $30 -&gt; $1 was shit hitting the fan. $266 -&gt; $50 was shit hitting the fan. But this? This "crash" is absolutely meaningless and has nothing to do with Bitcoin's long term viability. The price is still highly speculative, and since there have been issues with exchanges recently, the price has naturally gone down. As soon as the issues are sorted out we will be right back to where we were, if not higher.

Doge has tons of room to grow before it "wouldn't be fun anymore", to put it in your terms. And while I highly doubt doge could overtake the market cap of bitcoin, what makes you think that litecoin is safe and cozy at  Doge basically IS litecoin, with the ADDITION of an amazing community. All it would take to pass it is a 1000% increase in value, which is nothing in the context of virtual currencies, and especially with doge's rate of growth.

The reason experienced Bitcoiners are not sweating in the least is that all of this has happened before, and will likely happen again. I bought in heavily near the peak last April and was down about 2/3 for several months, i.e. in the same position many people are in now. But I held on for the exact same reasons I'm holding today, the same reasons OP brings up. There is absolutely no reason to panic, as the reason for the price drop has 0% to do with the Bitcoin tech and 100% to do with speculative trading. Nothing has changed about the future of Bitcoin. There has been a bear mentality amongst traders the past couple months, and the same people who are causing the price drop are profiting heavily from it. The only people who are panicking right now are the ones who haven't been around long enough to know that this is par for the course.

While that is undoubtedly true, I found it curious that some very big pieces of good news (like Overstock and Tigerdirect, which happened before mtgox's most recent dumbassery came to light) didn't affect the price at all.

One thing that drew me to Dogecoin was that it never moved in tandem with Bitcoin, as opposed to almost all the other alts. It's always done it's own thing, and we are seeing that now also. I highly doubt this current fall will last however. Despite the majority view on this subreddit that Doge is completely useless, there is no other crypto that has done so much crowd funding in such a short time, Bitcoin included. That, along with the amazing community, will most certainly at least keep Doge alive.

Yes, we do have an idea. This isn't like shooting darts blindfolded, we can base quasi-predictions on past and current events. It's hit $1242 already and that was months ago. This current price drop is a mirage, it is solely caused by bullshit exchange drama, something that has happened several times before and something we've bounced back from several times before. As OP has rightly noted, we are about to see a huge surge in infrastructure that will undoubtedly raise the price. In turn, this will create more demand, thereby again raising the price. Nothing has changed about the long term viability. You seem to forget how early in Bitcoin's history we still are.

In terms of the effect gox has on the Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole, I think previous problems with them were worse. Had this happened 6-8 months ago, the effect would've been monumental. However, looking at the infrastructure the way it is today and will soon be, I think we'll be shaking this off fairly quickly.

This logic is asinine. By selling at a loss and trying to "get back" some of your losses, you are putting far more risk on yourself than by simply holding. Even experienced day traders with their technical analyses can't time the market.

This is a baseless assumption. Argument previously used against bitcoin: "It is used by criminals and computer nerds. What serious business will accept it?"

This is somewhat true at the moment, but only because doge is so new. However, you assume that all LTC developers are strictly LTC developers, which is not true.

I love Bitcoin. I love Dogecoin for very different reasons. The two are in no way competing with each other; rather, doge is a lighthearted segue into the world of crypto coins. It's like a tutorial for bitcoin. Without any sort of financial pressure, it teaches people how to use a wallet, transact, and maybe even mine. Doge does nothing but help bitcoin.

I just cashed out 1 btc at $1150 (coinbase) and was hoping to buy at $800. Closest it got was $808, which is pretty damn close, but I've learned to not budge on my preset limits in times like these. 
If it wasn't evident already, I think the times of 80% crashes are over. Confidence in btc is higher than ever, there are way too many people looking to get cheap coin, and the price is at the point where people who got in around the April bubble are starting to see some real bank (encouraging small cash outs = $ in the bank = more people in a position to grab btc on sale). Both the 900-450 crash and this one are evidence of this (imo at least). The future looks bright.

This reasoning only makes sense right now, in this time of crazy volatility. If/when more merchants accept bitcoin (maybe even exclusively eventually), it becomes a generally accepted currency, and volatility calms down, if you want a banana, you'll buy a banana. I know I will. And if BTC go up 10% then your remaining coins are worth more and cover the cost of the banana, therefore making it technically free. 
As another example, if you had USD in savings/CD (assuming the interest is high enough to outpace inflation), would you keep it there til you die? Obviously you'll spend it at some point.
