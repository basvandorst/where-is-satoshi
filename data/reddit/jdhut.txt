there are people in the world with millions of euros.  still, if i go to europe I change a few hundred bucks into euros.  I don't understand your point at all

Yeah.  My thoughts were pretty similar to what's in this SO reply:

there's actually something to prevent this.  when you send a message you have to provide "proof of work" verifying the blockchain.  This is meant to prevent spam

No. Rich people getting richer is bad, even if the poor get richer or stay the same.  Because caring about one group means hating another.  /s

it's still the promise of future dividends that determines share prices, even if they are not paying currently.

yeah, the ones deciding to reinvest are betting on getting a bigger appreciation in their stock due to growth than they would've been able to provide with dividends.  That's not an indefinite strategy since you can only grow so long, then your profits get shared in the form of dividends once you are the big dog.  Still, the whole point of stocks is that shareholders will eventually share profits in the form of dividends.  That doesn't mean plenty of companies don't reinvest for a really long time, but it's usually ones that are expanding into other markets and stuff like that, or at least ones that say they are doing these expansions.
