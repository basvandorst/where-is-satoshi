A central power exerting control over a decentralized network does not make it any more decentralized. How does the logic in this article even make sense?
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:22:51
But if bitcoin needs centralized forces to come stand up for it, it has already failed or will in the soon future.

Sleek UI man! Is this going to be purely market data or an exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:38:53
Could be keeping the code somewhere else without memorizing it, maybe a safe deposit box. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:26:37
Three year low? I want to know where they’re buying their coins...
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:52:16
I’d suggest localbitcoins.com. It’s not exactly how it sounds, and you don’t have to buy locally. You can look at online offers from people and pay with various methods varying from wire transfers to gift card codes. Another option is purse.io and with them it’s a little different. You can pay for someone’s amazon wishlist and they pay you for it in bitcoin. As far as I know, none of these methods pay the site directly so you don’t have to worry about it leaving a trace. Both sites also use escrow if I’m not mistaken.

We don’t censor Bitcoin, we just hate bcash.
@_date: 2018-09-02 19:43:09
Socialism gave those governments the power to act on that corruption.
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:29:05
Because back when the fork happened, everyone hodling bitcoin also got an equal amount of bcash. The problem is, if your coins were on the exchange, coinbase didn’t give you the bcash until a few weeks ago. People lost tons of money being unable to trade their coin right away. Also, there was no warning about the addition to coinbase until it happened, but some people on the inside knew. This is insider trading and is illegal in regulated markets. That’s why people are pissed.
@_date: 2018-09-06 09:00:14
I’m not pro etf. It defeats the goal of adopting bitcoin as currency.

INCORRECT! Just because one can wipe the wallet and install custom firmware does NOT mean you have access to the public or private keys! At no point has someone been able to get the wallet information off of the device without the passcode.

As more jobs become automated and technology increases, jobs in new sectors become available. Manufacturing isn’t as big as it used to be, but now we have things like uber and Lyft. (Also pretty well paying and accessible  jobs btw) In the future self driving cars will kill that industry, and a new one will arise as technology advances. And if you’re making $20 an hour, invest some of that into yourself. Get a ged or go to college. Learn a skill. You could even just invest it to generate passive income. Anyone can improve their situation if they put forth the effort.
@_date: 2018-08-06 19:20:10
You’re saying no one has been banned from r/btc?��
@_date: 2018-08-16 02:26:52
It’s all hype. CBD does nothing, yet I see grams of cbd only wax going for $80 bucks at my local head shop. People eat that shit up. Great marketing imo.
@_date: 2018-08-29 18:01:51
Where are you getting your stats for that? No one is hogging all the technology and preventing anyone from benefiting from it. No, not everyone needs to put in more hours to accomplish the same. Inflation comes with a rise in pay. The only thing that comes even remotely close to causing this is a high minimum wage. It forces employers to cut out employees. When have you ever seen the minimum wage go *down*? The jobs that are disappearing are manufacturing jobs due to automation. If you could buy a machine and not have to pay it at all, or pay someone $12 an hour for unspecialized work, which would you choose? 
@_date: 2018-08-16 19:09:56
It’s all marketing. It’s not hard to manufacture a study that helps your cause. CBD is as effective as essential oils. That is to say, 100% placebo.
@_date: 2018-08-01 15:58:17
The fake news in this sub alone is astounding, until you look at r/btc or bitcoin.com. Thats why ico’s are so sketchy, they’re just confidence men trying to convince you their coin has value. Otherwise they have nothing. Rodger Ver is an example of a successful con man in this game. 
I’m glad they brought up Rodger. It’s important to expose scam artists in the crypto environment, hopefully mainstream outlets will stop accepting his bribes and speak out on him one day.
@_date: 2018-08-29 18:16:46
I would hate to see a coin that claims to be better than Bitcoin get completely destroyed by an attack on its security flaws.
@_date: 2018-08-20 22:21:53
I think that’s also dependent on your relationship with coinbase. Like you have that limit until you reach that limit once, and then your account level goes up allowing you to purchase more in a week. But I’m not wealthy enough to purchase $10,000 of bitcoin a week, so I may be wrong.
@_date: 2018-08-29 18:19:10
Whatever man, sounds like you’re pretty set in your thoughts. I’m not going to keep trying to convince you otherwise.

Sadly bcash is pretty high on that list. I’m surprised Google openly lists scams on their search engine.
@_date: 2018-08-29 08:46:45
Nope, plenty of bcash scammers still support him. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 18:49:25

How can anyone smart enough to use crypto be stupid enough to fall for this?
@_date: 2018-08-14 05:36:36
Show me the custom firmware that allows people to steal private keys off of this device. And as far as supporting bcash, I’ve never been so insulted in my life.

As someone who struggled with adhd all throughout my schooling, I say you learn how to function with it. Giving up and not pushing yourself isn’t an option. If you fail/drop out, get a ged. And no, 8 bucks an hour is not the only option to those without a diploma. I’ve held many jobs that pay between 15-20 an hour that required no prior experience or diploma such as driving for the post office, serving, and warehouse work. There is always opportunity to better your situation. If you take it, great. If not, that’s on you.

That’s just not true. Anyone who works hard can become wealthy. An attitude that it doesn’t matter how hard you work is what keeps people down. Most of the time it’s bad decisions that keep people poor. Bad financial decisions, having kids too early, and lack of education are the main reasons people stay poor. It’s not like the wealthy are wealthy because they stole from poor people.

The reason we bash it so much is because Rodger and his r/btc lie about it so much. If we don’t combat that, the lies win and we’re all fucked. So cheers to fighting scammers!

No, they probably make him sell it for their currency.
@_date: 2018-08-18 17:12:36
True, but it also shows how desperate governments are to get control over the technology.
@_date: 2018-08-14 19:48:22
Yeah, and eventually exchanges are going to get fed up and we’ll just have bitcoin. The day of the fork it would be wise to sell all bcash you might be holding.
@_date: 2018-08-16 02:17:47
To anyone who cares, go look at the all time price charts for Bitcoin and bcash. Bitcoin is still up 482% from when it was first listed on Coinbase, bcash is right where it started. That’s what happens when you build a coin off of lies rather than useful technology. 
Edit: changed launched to listed.

Let’s be honest. The bitcoin subreddit is pretty big. A lot of new, naive investors come here all the time looking for advice. If someone were to moderate that vast pool of money, I’m sure they could also make themselves a pretty penny by helping powerful people manipulate public opinion. There’s no denying that people have certainly asked, and most people would certainly say yes. There’s no real way we could tell unless one of the two parties disclosed that information, but I’m sure that a few posts may slide under the radar here or there.

No, it can’t be implemented by everyone because it’s patented. They can deny access to the technology as they please. Don’t get me wrong, Bitmain is a pain to deal with and we need competitors, but we need competitors on an even playing field.

@_date: 2018-03-09 04:06:59
This is just a big crony deal to establish the mining power in the hands of a few centralized groups. The guys implementing this get control over where you can mine, since they make the machines function poorly when you’re not on a pool that supports their patented system. So pools will have to pay or worse to use the proprietary technology if they ever want individuals with miners like this to mine at their pool. Or these guys could just own all the pools that use the patent and not give you a choice to go elsewhere. A totally captive market at that point, and then we’re all screwed if we decide things should go in a less centralized direction.

@_date: 2018-03-09 23:40:32
The only way anyone would be able to use this patent is by either using it in a jurisdiction that does not recognize the patent or using it for purposes that do not generate revenue.
Does it sound like the technology will be available to everyone? Not to me. What it sounds like is that this company will attempt to corner the market and centralize it around themselves. The possibilities for centralization and corruption are astronomical for what is proposed. I’m not buying into anything that gives people an unfair leg up in what is supposed to be a fair and equal market controlled by no one.

There won’t ever be enough bitcoin for even 5% of the US population to own a whole one. This makes me think that as bitcoin gains mainstream attention (and it will with the introduction of crypto ETFs on the NYSE) that it’s prices will soar.

Well, a higher percentage of people use crypto in less developed countries than in giants like America and the EU. I see their logic in deploying there first.

I feel like this is not good for bitcoin in the long run. My personal vision for bitcoin is that it pushes banks out of the picture and all transactions are person to person without a middle man. Correct me if I am wrong, but doesn’t using bitcoin to buy prepaid cards just support the banking system that’s already in place? The infrastructure around credit/debit cards is run by banks afaik so this is doing us a disservice. Plus the charges on a bitcoin funded Visa card could be reversed. There’s just tons of things I see wrong with this long term. Short term, I think it’s great to get people accustomed to the idea of bitcoin being a feasible currency.

Couldn’t you just send the coins to another wallet you control (to gain plausible deniability for it being payment you sent to someone else’s wallet) and tumble the coins into a final wallet? The coins and address would have no ties to you so the government couldn’t tax you on the returns. Of course I would never do this since I am a law abiding citizen
@_date: 2018-07-15 23:10:42
It is to Roger because a big portion of bcash sales were from people confusing it with Bitcoin, or thinking it was the “real” bitcoin as Roger advertised. When you take away that confusion it’s harder for him to sell his alt coin and that makes him upset.

Yeah, I completely agree with that. Like I said I think it’s great for bitcoin in the short term by raising awareness and ease of use. However, I think this is something we will need to branch away from in the future, to make BTC independent from fiat currencies.
