So a goxcoin? Thanks, I should pay more attention to what is going on..

I love Preev, I hope this is just a server malfunction and it'll be back up soon. Great, long standing free service imo

Where is BFX listed? Or am I misunderstanding something..?
@_date: 2016-08-12 10:13:27
Quick question. Wouldnt it be possible for the payment processing system to pull data regarding the average going block creation time in advance of providing the payment window. In this way, the user might get the remainding time for the current block + however long the next blog is assumed to be. 
I don't understand what's to be lost by providing a longer payment window (and ofc automatically returning the money, if they are sent outside of this window, minus the fee) 
@_date: 2015-12-10 16:33:41
Hehe, TIL :)
@_date: 2015-12-02 10:07:00
I can't believe noone hasnt commented on this. This is a such a great catch! Of late, I too have been comparing Bitcoin to the natural world. For example, the concept of remediation is similar, if not identical to biogenesis. The environment around Bitcoin is referred to as an ecosystem, but few appreciates just how much it acts as one, with attributes normally applied to the world of the living. 
I'd upvote you a million times more for pointing at this connection between the concept of technology disruption and biological invasive species, making the natural-technological relation even more compelling!

Well, I think the correct term is representative, or indirect, democracy. But you are right, it's a far way off from the ideal direct democracy
@_date: 2015-12-04 11:21:21
It refers to moving lots of information (an unprecedented amount of multimedia) compared to the mediums that came before
@_date: 2015-12-25 11:57:14
Quick question, are these suggested services different from localbitcoins?
@_date: 2015-12-10 10:23:27
I don't udnerstand the orange envelope metaphor, care to elaborate. Also, checking for shadowban :p
@_date: 2015-12-16 09:13:06
You sort of got the headline wrong. The community is a better ally for him to have, not the other way around :P
@_date: 2015-12-11 11:28:03
This is a stupid post. Is there an actual question or is it a troll attempt?
Everyone is also unhappy with fiat, yet the majority of us still has to use it, while we strive to use something better.

The ordinary person does not need to understand the block chain and whatever else is inbetween, just how to pull of transactions. In this view, which fits my optic well, your proposal makes perfect sense, and professors would probably urge me to focus on this, yet I hate having to work with people, which this would entail :/
@_date: 2014-01-20 20:14:59
I do get the idea and this might just be the most precious input thus far. Thanks a lot! And I do agree, usability in the HCI is a big issue, which also happens to be one of the objects holding the mainstream away from bitcoin
@_date: 2018-05-27 14:03:57
Anyone had luck with withdrawing after verifying? I cannot...
@_date: 2018-05-27 14:04:45
Mine too. Any luck or idea of what to do? We know making a support ticket is useless..
@_date: 2014-01-20 20:15:34
Very comprehensive list I had not seen until now, thanks :)
@_date: 2014-03-11 11:21:47
Stahp! My sides :/
@_date: 2018-05-27 19:26:24
I was able to just now pull my funds out of there. Good luck! :)
@_date: 2014-01-20 22:11:55
I can only imagine the amount of issues economists can address. I however, am forced to merely touch on the subject of bitcoin as an actually currency and stick to bitcoin as a case of disruptive innovation in regards to HCI, mostly
@_date: 2014-01-20 22:35:44
usability testing, eew. But you certainly hit the nail on the head in regards to what I SHOULD focus on, and mostly likely will end up doing. Until then I hope I'll come up with a more interesting alternative :)
@_date: 2014-01-20 20:06:26
Indeed, but it did take a secondary to my primary question of the post, mind you
@_date: 2014-01-20 22:12:43
If it is deemed worthy, I would very much like to :)
@_date: 2014-01-20 20:17:03
This is all interesting, but how does it relate to bitcoin specifically? Besides using it as a means of payment for the services provided 
@_date: 2016-06-02 08:36:05
I love it! Just sent it to a few of my friends who still doesn't get it. Not that the commercial explains the nature of it's system very well, it does cover very well, how "it's a global invitation in inclusion. I loved that part! 
Yet, I would love it if we stopped saying it's "instantly" soon. 
@_date: 2016-06-29 13:36:59
I tried this, but it seems the issue was deeper. Something in the block folder was corrupt, so now im downloading the chain again and hoping i might be able to recover my coins then. THanks though!
@_date: 2016-11-17 15:08:26
I totally agree.But I think as Bitcoin becomes mainstream and ppl start trusting blockchain, they will soon realize Bitcoin was just the prototype and almost everything created since is better.Imo
@_date: 2016-09-22 06:37:17
Hey man, do you mind linking a few of these open source bots that works and are trustworthy? I only know a bit of python, so I'm fairly blind when it comes to assessing these myself :/
@_date: 2016-10-23 21:29:50
Yeah, his integrity is impeccable.. only bs he ever let out was that blockchain tech would create more jobs, but I understand that's a popular selling point with the public
@_date: 2015-04-23 07:36:53
Very insightful read. Although I dabble mostly in "soft'er" sciences, I am currently attempting something similar. If you don't mind, I might throw you a PM later :)
@_date: 2016-10-24 11:35:55
Regradless, net gain of jobs generally is less than before if disruption happens in an industry. Completely new industries, like actual space travel and colonization are rare and few, but does create more jobs. I just don't think entirely new industries will ever be able to compensate for fading ones, all in all. 
@_date: 2016-10-24 08:59:08
Of course some jobs have been created, but many more have been destroyed by the new industry. In the short term it will seem like jobs are created. All innovations will make less jobs available in the long term. Hench why I specified "more jobs" and not just jobs :)
@_date: 2015-11-15 10:25:26
Banks will probably never go away, they will restructure, adapt, but become a much less influental and bloated industry, I think
@_date: 2015-11-27 09:36:50
You sound like a genuinely great father and I am so happy for you and your family, and to learn that Bitcoin has such a social impact in unexpected ways :)
@_date: 2015-11-16 09:29:30
"Parental capital control" :D

I'm continuously blown away by this guy. He's so great at speaking about Bitcoin and blockchain, his passion shines through. 
@_date: 2016-10-09 08:41:53
To visualize the "Apple hating on Bitcoin" conspiracy, does anyone have a timeline of the approve scam wallets, perhaps along with their removal from the shop, that can be compared with similar events in Android shop?
@_date: 2015-03-04 15:47:13
It hurts my head how incredible ignorant those senate people are and it worries me a lot that these people are in a position of control 
@_date: 2015-03-02 18:48:01
Ah yes, this is an excellent suggestion. I have looked into, and it might be what I'll try, come the right time. Thanks :) 
@_date: 2015-03-18 08:34:08
I am not mobile now and don't have access to my favs, but someone put together a link collection that. Send pm to remind me :)
@_date: 2015-02-25 16:19:09
I don't hold more than 0.01ish BTC, but I couldn't care less about the price if I did hold more. I just want to educate people and further the adoption of Bitcoin. I udnerstand now that I cant expect to make anything doing it, so yes, I will simply continue to do it as a hobby :)
@_date: 2016-05-16 14:16:56
Oh yeah, I get that. I was just assuming it was something more profound, show casing the power of the blockchain or something similar to that hehe :)
@_date: 2015-02-25 15:27:28
Basically, understanding Bitcoin as a medium and the phenomenon that is the ecosystem around it. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 15:28:59
Understandable. The site should go live soon-ish, I will make sure to post it here :)
@_date: 2015-02-25 20:09:22
I hope you are right
@_date: 2015-02-25 15:35:51
Thanks so much for your response. You basically confirmed what I suspected. A friend and I have actually teamed up and expect to make a living out of consulting on informatics in an information industry which is becoming more and more decentralized. So we aim a bit more general, and look at the entire decentralized scene as a societal/global radical movement from centralized to decentralized structures. As such, I shall not presently expect a return on my invest in the site :) 
@_date: 2015-02-25 16:15:54
Wow, while user research has not been a focus of mine, I think you are on to something here. At least I feel like here is something I can use after my education :)
@_date: 2016-05-16 12:24:18
I'm curious, how should he have presented the information? There's no reference to another post either, so I am just curious.
@_date: 2015-02-25 15:28:22
I am more of a qualitative research kinda guy, but have done my fair share of quantitative stuff, what do you refer to?
@_date: 2015-02-25 16:13:16
Didnt expect to, just wanted to gauge what I could expect :)
@_date: 2016-07-25 15:49:42
You've probably motivated and guided quite a bit more users then OP, thanks :)
@_date: 2015-02-25 15:53:18
In the spirit of researching an open-source, largely transparent technology I wanted to put my findings out there, as part of the ecosystem. Putting it behind a pay wall seems contradictory. That being said, I hear you and im sure you are correct. It will not make any money unless I take serious steps to use pay walls or clutter it with ads, which I will not. So ill just accept not to make anything on it. I was basically wondering, if there was a market for donations / tips for information (which sadly is a point im making in the thesis, referring to the emergent 'tipping culture'). Thanks for your input :)
@_date: 2013-04-17 12:31:22
Hey man, this sounds great. What is your time frame of completion of this projekt?
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:37:30
Excuse my ignorance, but where do you gather this data? :(
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:35:35
It doesn't matter whether or not governments recognizes bitcoin as a currency in their paradigm really.. Which is the great thing about it :D
@_date: 2013-04-23 22:56:21
Sounds a bit too good to be true. Im gonna make an account there and check out what this SEPA is about, but just to make sure I got this right. I can use bitstamp to buy bitcoins, transfer them to my wallet without for a small fee and then transfer them to an exchange of my choice?
@_date: 2013-05-05 11:11:13
What incentives would the Chinese government have to promote and allow Bitcoin? I don't understand why they would want to adopt it, other than promoting it's use as speculative investment within their own borders 
@_date: 2013-04-29 10:45:36
All my friends and family are already tired of listening to me harassing them about "the future of currency". I think I only made crypocurrencies worse off in my efforts :(
@_date: 2013-12-12 00:08:39
Im a newb, but I dont see any other way around bitcoin being highly volatile for many years to come, until most of the world has partly or slowly accepted bitcoin. Having wall street brokers get in on the action, in my opinion, will only furthers this inevitable volatility, making it a necessary evil. Am I completely wrong in this?
