I've been in the market myself, although I'm in the US.
Robocoin is shipping in about 8 weeks, and I'm seriously considering that one.  If I wait much longer, I may just buy that.
I'd definitely like to see some others available directly for bitcoin.  The ones at SeeMeCNC are in my price range and shipping now.  I'd probably have pulled the trigger on one of those by now if they accepted bitcoin.
I want to turn a coin or two into a 3d printer too.  Just need to pick one and it's really disappointing to see how many of the awesome new ones that are getting press aren't ACTUALLY available for purchase yet.

Or worse, they sell your information on a new list: "These are the people who were willing to spend .25 BTC to suppress their private data.  They're probably loaded".

Because some folks want to see ISO coding for bitcoin along the lines of USD, EUR, XAU, etc.
The BT prefix is already taken by the country of Bhutan because their ISO code is BT.  Commodities like gold and silver are examples of ISO codes in use that aren't tied to a country and their codes are XAU and XAG, respectively.
If ISO starts to list Bitcoin, it most likely won't be as BTC, and there's a large following for XBT.  
I like BTC, but I like the idea of bitcoin being listed as one of the ISO currencies more.

There once was a guy from Nantucket  
who put all his cash in a bucket  
he figured he'd try  
to reach for the sky  
and now he's sure glad he said "fuck it"

PotatoBadger got you the "why".
