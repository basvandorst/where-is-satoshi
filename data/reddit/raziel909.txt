Yea right, 5 men holds 80%+ hashing power, nice decentralization
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:43:35
It will because people are pumping others coins for speed, fees itd.
Why would anyone pump other coins if bitcoin is fast and cheap as lets say iota, no need for bitcoin cash, no need for ltc itd itd
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:59:56
We will see whats going to happen tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:46:16
Well thats one way, the other way is miners will pump BCH, so people who hold bch will not sell it, because why would you sell something that is going up. Lets hope that many will sell that shitcoin

Dude are you drunk normal market movement for crypto??? Where btc dropped 15% in one day and alts almost 30%, this isnt any normal market movement at all
@_date: 2018-09-15 16:15:07
then back to 3k :D
@_date: 2018-08-11 10:42:46
To me this looks like it can go down to 2k$, and recovery will last for 3 years
@_date: 2018-08-11 21:28:43
8 months has past so it should already be 3k, dont think it will be 1.5 years
@_date: 2018-08-02 23:22:35
Yeah i heard x10 EOY
@_date: 2018-06-24 10:59:54
yea i agree
@_date: 2018-06-19 10:01:14
People in crypto... he thinks that if btc falls below 600$ then its crash, if stock market falls over 10% its huge crash.
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:12:52
Hey hey hey
@_date: 2018-06-18 00:16:29
in PP its not if you had 1$ in 1900 and now its not the same thing, he is saying that in 30 years dollar could collapse same as any fiat

Btc droping Bch rising are we in a political war?
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:28:33
8mb is doing about 50 tps, visa is doing around 1m tps, so bitcoin need about 100gb block or even more
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:32:03
I think that alot of miners are dumping btc for bch
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:11:20
I think that the worst is over, ver moved 25,000btc which isnt so much
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:20:37
like i said you need over 100gb block to operate like visa, thats stupid, imagine blockchain with 100gb block, can that even function, can miners handle that, can notes handle that? btw how much miners do you need for that, how much electricity?
@_date: 2018-03-12 23:18:29
I agree but every coin is volatile, plus it will stabilize when cards are starting to get to users aka a lot of coins will be locked.
@_date: 2018-03-12 21:26:45
You need to hold it for 6 months, then coins are back to you, basically you got it for free, you have a free card too
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:30:26
I agree
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:36:25
This is the most epic thing in 2019
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:27:31
Who is seller among them?
@_date: 2018-03-12 21:24:17
We are all in crypto to avoid middleman but it will take some time  (another 10-15 years for that), btw you can pay with monaco app with crypto (crypto-crypto) as any crypto wallet

@_date: 2018-02-01 15:41:23
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:41:55
Sure btc is decentralized with 5 men holding 80% hashrate
@_date: 2018-07-23 22:14:33
really? You cant send-receive btc in robinhood?
@_date: 2018-07-24 09:25:43
Yeah im more prepared for that "nothing happens"
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:31:59
Hahaha imagine that, entering a bank and you see that.
@_date: 2018-07-05 14:12:15
