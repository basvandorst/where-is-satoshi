or if you are in a country where the only few exchanges only trade bitcoin, you stick with what you have, esp in times where the tx fee was high, transferring btc to a more complete exchange to trade alt coins was extremely prohibitive

This question right here

after it hits 11k, sure

well, a round trip plane ticket between the countries i planned to make the transfer is on the $2000 range if bought in advance, so i am sure wiring it would still be a better option.

swings come and go. if you are patient, you will eventually break even. investing only what you can afford is a great way to make yourself patient

i actually bought last week as a way to transfer value between countries. got fucked by the drop and would have spent much less if I had just wired it if i sell now. so my personal experience is a failure at this point

if so, he would still have 40k at ath if he held it
edit: ITT people hung up on the 40k value and ignoring the % gains

this is one fundamental people keep on missing: be in it for the technology, not for the coin
blockchain being used for currency is just the tip of the iceberg

good luck predicting every dip and every rise
i daytraded currencies for years. daytrading btc is a completely different animal

the ipod wasn't the first mp3 player. many of the 2000+ born folks dont even know how the first mp3 player looked like
intel wasn't the first cpu manufacturer
nvdia was not the first leading gpu maker
i hope i am wrong, but btc could very well become nokia of cryptocurrencies

I understand. I wouldn't be crying if there was an unexpected boom after I bought, so I understand shit like this is part of this crazy volatility. Luckily I can hold this for a while in hopes I will break even at some point, but I feel for those who don't follow the "put only what you can afford to lose" mantra

US only?
