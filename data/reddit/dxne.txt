Is that Bitcoin's market cap?

I can help you as I'm based in Singapore. But then it's a matter of trust. Better to ask your friends first haha!

I'm Singaporean, welcome to Singapore! :D

Anyone used Jaxx before? They have passphrase backup. I'm using it now and seems pretty good. I need to know what the rest thinks about it lol! I ain't a technical expert :(

crane: That bird is a crane./They had to use a crane to lift the object./She had to crane her neck to see the movie.
date: Her favorite fruit to eat is a date./Joe took Alexandria out on a date.
engaged: They got engaged on March 7th./The students were very engaged in the presentation.
foil: Please wrap the sandwich in foil./They learned about the role of a dramatic foil in English class.
leaves: The children love to play in the leaves./They do not like when their father leaves for work.
net: What was your net gain for the year?/Crabbing is easier if you bring a net along.
point: The pencil has a sharp point./It is not polite to point at people.
right: You were right./Make a right turn at the light.
rose: My favorite flower is a rose./He quickly rose from his seat.
type: He can type over 100 words per minute./That dress is really not her type.
...in short, nothing wrong with using "Bit(s)"

Inter-networking or internet-working? ��

Sorry for your loss :( It's situations like this I've set a password protected note (on the steps) somewhere on how to access my funds. Give it to someone i trust within the family. You'll never know when your time is up - sudden or not. Hopefully my stash will benefit someone (and the Bitcoin community) instead of being "lost".

Oh gawd me too... hate it when network fees mess up my round numbers -_-
@_date: 2016-12-11 15:16:18
Keepkey ;)

Yup, prefer bits too. 1 bit, 5 bits, 20 bits, 100 bits, 1000 bits.
@_date: 2017-05-05 05:52:12
I'm sure everyone wants that.. but that's an even longer shot haha!
@_date: 2017-05-06 11:36:13
Even via the Coinbase app?
@_date: 2017-05-05 06:10:18
If $8.90 meal = 8.9bits (or 89bits if $0.10/bit) sounds reasonable. ;p
@_date: 2016-07-10 05:43:48
I would prefer Bits as a standard. If we see a bicycle to be worth 100bits then it shall be 100bits. If a potato is worth 1bit then it shall be 1bit.
@_date: 2016-07-03 16:28:05
It's just a thought actually. Not a serious question. :)
@_date: 2016-07-03 16:32:45
LOL! Yeah that's the likely the case.

Wheeee! Happy Halvening from Asia!
