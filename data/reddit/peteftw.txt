Because it's a legal document, not a Word document. You can't just add a line and click save.
Edit: wait, are you serious or sarcastic? I honestly can't tell anymore.

You can be refused service by any company for any reason except the protected classes. 
You think you free market fanbois would know this.

And how does that enable your socialism? What workers are you powering by engaging in a top-down pyramid scheme?

There's a place across from my office that sells them for ten times that amount. I hate that place.

I think it's in the reddit rules that you can't have a conflict of interest in a community you mod, that's pretty much more than enough reason for to use this as an opportunity to step down from his or her mod duties. 
It's not a big deal, I mean, he or she can stay an active member of the community without being a mod, but they should absolutely not remain as one while working for a Bitcoin company.
Unless that is role at changetip is *dependent* on their mod status. Then we have a whole fuck ton of very obvious issues. Anywho, I think my point was pretty clear, but I also feel these things are **extremely obvious**. So I guess I'll see how it all plays out? What's without some conspiracy theory anyway?

And those checks and balances are?

There's no way socialists would buy any Bitcoin ever.
