I'm a psychiatrist. We still live in a society in which treatment of mental illness is stigmatized. I cannot recommend patients pay me with Bitcoin unless they take steps to remain anonymous.

PM me too, please.

I was imagining that the EHR would be a decentralized autonomous corporation rather than a trusted third party. You'd pay for its services using a cryptocurrency. Maybe I've been reading too much scifi and recently.

I am a bitcoin-accepting psychiatrist in Manhattan:

One concern that I have is how to advise patients regarding the privacy of bitcoin payments. Like other newfangled things (such as Skype sessions), there are all sorts of potential benefits but also new risks, which may not be obvious. For example, although Bitcoin is often touted (or criticized) in the media as being anonymous and untraceable, it is actually quite hard to use it without being identifiable. So, should a physician, therapist, or lawyer accepting bitcoin advise their patients/clients to use a tumbler to send payment? Or should the professional do the tumbling after receiving payment? Is that "money laundering" or is it "trying to preserve your clients' privacy?" Is it best to do this on one's own or use a payment processor like bitpay or coinbase? What are the privacy implications of these choices? Given these uncertainties, I've not been recommending that patients pay me in bitcoin, but I have been fielding questions about it.

I suggest that the Bitcoin Foundation (or a Kickstarter?) funds a four to seven day dev-only retreat so they can spend some time in person to build trust and hash out some of their differences. Even small in-person working groups end up with complicated interpersonal dynamics; communicating electronically makes is even harder to maintain morale and trust. Where is Deanna Troi when you need her?

Informed consent is the main thing to insist upon. If I felt a patient really understood the privacy implications of paying in bitcoin, and was still okay with it, then terrific! But I'm being extra-careful to refrain from pressuring any patient to pay me in bitcoin. Given that I own some bitcoin, and that I expect bitcoin to appreciate as adoption increases, it could easily appear to patients (and rightly so) that I have a conflict of interest in recommending that they pay using bitcoin. I leave the decision of whether to pay using bitcoin, cash, check, credit, or debit entirely up to the patient.

Great idea! Perhaps start a Google Group or a listserv?

I am a psychiatrist and would advise anyone paying me in bitcoin to take measures to secure their privacy.

Several of my patients choose to pay in cash for this reason. Hopefully soon Bitcoin with stealth addresses and coinjoin, or other privacy oriented coins (such as monero or zerocash), will provide other options. I'd love to offer tele-psychiatry services (video-conferenced consultations) for payment using cryptocurrency.

I don't disagree; but what if every licensed physician were issued something like a Trezor to hold patients' private keys? 
@_date: 2014-08-18 18:33:00
I've been resisting the urge to use an electronic medical record because none of them that I know of allow for the physician to hold the encryption keys. We are entirely reliant on the (typically closed source) commercial vendors to secure the clinical information. As absurd as it seems, in 2014 it seems much safer from a privacy point of view to have a written chart.

I was thinking of an open-source EHR with strong crypto implemented in something like  or  Medical information (in the US) is kept in separate silos that are poorly secured and don't interoperate. It would be infinitely more useful to have your brain MRI stored in a secure decentralized cloud that only you, your spouse, your neurosurgeon, and your primary care doc have the keys to. When you retire to Florida and have a stroke, your neurologist would be able to find your MRI without relying on your memory of which radiology office kept a copy of the scan.

It would be wonderful if one of you cryptocurrency programmers invented an Electronic Health Record (EHR) that was cryptographically secured by m-of-n keys, where the patient, the primary card physician, specialists, and a health care proxy held the keys, to make it much harder for hackers to steal protected health information.

Yes, more than a year ago; but I don't want to say any more than that publicly. Sorry!
@_date: 2014-08-18 22:02:38
I think StorJ and MaidSafe could store MRIs.

I'm willing to mediate. Serious offer.
