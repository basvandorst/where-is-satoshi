You said that their info is incorrect, which seems to imply that they are misrepresenting Ron Paul's positions. I mostly disagree, so let's break this down.
First, [here]( is Ron Paul in 2012 doubling down on his position in 2012 that sexual harassment shouldn't be illegal and that he has no problem with anything short of physical assault.
You may think public school, the DoE and anti-discrimination laws are bad, but they are correctly describing Paul's beliefs. Moving on.
Ron Paul wants [either states or private companies]( to own public land.
Reminder, the person who said that Ron Paul would be an economic and foreign policy disaster was a different person than who you're responding to. They've clearly expanded the original claim to include other reasons Ron Paul would be a disaster.
[Here's]( Paul on evolution.
Come on man. Here's Ron on church and state.




Ron Paul on campaign finance:


They are accurately stating that Ron Paul said we should default on the debt. Just because you agree with that idea doesn't make this a misrepresentation.

No, that's not correct. Credit unions are non-profit and owned by the people that have money in them. Each person receives an equal vote, regardless of how much money they have. Any profits are put back into better interest rates and the like. The executives are paid next to nothing relative to the big banks. I'd seriously consider it.

You don't need to put money in banks now. Switch to a credit union.

Below inflation for sure, but you can get close depending on your financial institution. Ally, Alliant, Discover, Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Synchrony all offer somewhere between 1.4% and 1.5% APY

Nice. Be sure to pay in as much as you can.

I specified that they were needed for the modern economy for a reason. The invention of the wheel happened without internet but hypothetically losing the internet would cripple the global economy, at least in the short term.


Sure, but that's an outlier. Check the graph, recessions were longer and more frequent on average before the Federal Reserve existed.


Yeah, the Federal Reserve blew it during the Great Depression. Here's a quote by Been Bernanke on the topic.




Bernanke was right. Rather than raising interest rates like the Fed did prior to the Great Depression, central banks across the world slashed them in response. As a result, the economy rapidly began to recover.

Which countries in the world would you say currently have a "crony economy?"

Well, you're supposed to continue adding money to them. You also have to consider that the CPI is tied to a group of goods that are mostly static over time, and take into account how many big-ticket items have gotten relatively cheaper. 
If you really want to beat CPI you'll need to invest your money. Index funds work if you're lazy, busy or both.


Disagree. Since Volcker's time as chair of the Fed, [inflation has been far more stable]( which is desirable for a currency and the economy it depends on. Since the Federal Reserve's inception, recessions [have been less frequent and shorter]( The Fed isn't perfect but it's necessary to the functioning of the modern economy.
