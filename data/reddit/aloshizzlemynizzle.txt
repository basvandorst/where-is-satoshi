Coinbase pro won’t let me dollar cost average everyday unfortunately. It takes 5 business days to clear although with Gemini you already have the Bitcoin in possession

I live in the US tho lol

Coinbase Pro. Other exchanges charge 3 to 5%
@_date: 2018-10-11 15:07:35
The stock market hasn’t had a problem since 2008 dude. The hell are you talking about
@_date: 2018-10-11 16:36:02
I would rather pay a 1% fee. All exchanges need fees to survive in my opinion 
@_date: 2018-10-11 15:32:08
What bank do you use. It takes over a week for me
@_date: 2018-10-11 15:00:34
What’s wrong with a 1% fee. Have you seen the cancerous fees on coinbase.
@_date: 2018-10-11 15:18:07
Not only that Gemini tends to have lower BTC prices than most
@_date: 2018-10-07 00:34:36
Yeah but Cash App has higher Bitcoin prices than average. Gemini tends to have low prices compared to many.
@_date: 2018-10-11 15:16:46
Yeah but that takes 5 business days for your money to even clear. Gemini lets you buy instantly 
@_date: 2018-10-11 15:41:56
Yes :/ unfortunately I live in the US lol

I have no idea. I’m not the only one though.

I wish somebody tipped me. A brother struggling for those Satoshis

The only answer I got was “our decision is final, you’re no longer able to send and receive payments. They didn’t even give me a reason 
@_date: 2019-01-30 02:10:25
It sure does
@_date: 2019-01-29 18:43:47
Agreed. This experience strengthens my views on bitcoin even more
@_date: 2019-01-29 15:51:55
My bitcoin wallet. That’s literally it. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 17:24:57
I think if you’re bitcoin maximalist, all that matters to you is BTC. But if you’re into Altcoins, you pretty much always look at USD
@_date: 2019-01-29 17:17:30
I bought it from cash app and just sent it to my bitcoin wallet. That’s literally all I did 
@_date: 2019-01-29 15:52:23
A regular bank account and it was only 10 bucks worth. Literally 
@_date: 2019-01-29 17:44:46
I don’t get what’s so hard to understand lol
@_date: 2019-01-29 15:54:31
Mind you I have been buying small amounts of bitcoin like 5 or 10$. For the past few months. Nothing huge and withdrawing to my btc wallet. Never had an issue until now. The last thing I did on the app was buy 10$ worth of bitcoin and all of sudden, my account is closed.
@_date: 2019-01-29 17:06:41
What do you mean? I just used my bank account linked to cash app. Bought a few bucks from time to time then sent them to my wallet. That’s it. Nothing malicious or weird, just wanted to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-25 04:16:38
Don’t know why people would want to buy from a ATM.You might as well buy it from an exchange since the fees and coins seem to be higher on that. I’d probably just do it once just to say I’ve used a crypto Atm.

I would imagine his girlfriend has access or his family especially since Brazil is a fairly poor country. I doubt he would keep all the funds to himself and not share that info in case of an emergency
