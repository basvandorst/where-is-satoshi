Best news I've read in ages :-)

Max has never owned any alts,  simply mentioned it on Twitter after interviewing Bill Still... then it spiraled out blame the social marketers
He has suggested zynga would do this long ago (and he's not a fan of them either, he has attacked their immorality and low wages many times)

Omg really? How come the main steam media isn't covering this outbreak in criminality and violence?
I'm going to have to destroy my steel toe capped boots now... They could be used for serious assault if in not vigilant!

As a fully qualified member of the twin club I approve of the term Winklevii. Seeing it has brought me much joy.
Joke as we might coinvalidation will help the move to mainstream... Its ghastly and aweful but its gonna (try) be implemented

1. Bitmessage android app
2. Integrate something into a wallet that checks what the (USD or whatever) value of your BTC transaction was at the historical time it occurred (allowing at rough total estimation of how much you've really spent/gained etc)

Thank fuck for that
@_date: 2013-12-14 18:59:47
..apart from the fact that you're trusting a third party with your bitcoin and that the app is outrageously ugly and featureless?

Most of these alts are indeed copy+ paste jobs as you say (and those should be treated with appropriate distaste, they piss me off too but I got over it)
That being said there is no shortage of good ones with great potential and benefits. (Do I really need to say this?)
BTC is not broken, I'm just freaking out because of gex (it really should worry people more, I'm glad it doesn't yet as I'm invested in BTC just like you)
It'd be more sensible to use our energy educating people about cryptocurrancies rather than arguing with people who are on the same side

That made my day man!

Looks like I'm just going to have to pay with BTC... ooh well :-)

Wow man that's just cool
Automate as much as possible and if you decide to do this as a service sign me up for one please. 
I'll gladly provide my own QR and 50-70mBTC for one(currently, maybe more lol..really want one).
If things take off and you need to expand checkout crypto::stocks, I certainly would invest in this... so darn cool!
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:02:49
Not that I needed it but it was appreciated :-)

I thought it was a very well written article. Anything that helps educate the unwashed masses gets my vote, especially if it's well written and in a format that I could present to my father. (Ie: it doesn't look like some kinda crazy, to the moon, anarchist hacker rant)
It is pretty objective and does attempt to address the meaning of currency/value and security.... which is important for those who have doubts or are still learning
Thumbs up

Gex.io has more than 50% I read.
Find out what that means!
It's enough reason to have made me want to invest least half of my BTC in others. BTC will always be the big daddy but embrace alts, as a hacker I can no longer allow the delusion that  BTC is secure sadly

I've seen these protectors you think so highly of steal my grand parents homes, my parents home, their pensions and much more in my short lifetime.
Crypto banks already exist (or at least are in the pipes) and I consult one in fact.
Feel free to be a believer, I choose not to but if you're even vaguely into crypto why the hell are you bringing this third-party-trust ideal with you?
Shake it off man, seriously... consensus over a decentralized and trustless network..... means of arbitration and these old school models will be introduced eventually (at the protocol level) but even outside of the tech WoT makes this possible.
I've moved to crypto because I am now my own bank. Third parties (for 99.99% of everything economic I do) are redundant

Yup, they're nice guys going by the email exchanges I've had with them.
Before I tried them I made some suggestions (e.g. charging less commission on trades) which they have actually implemented. They're new but if they listened to my suggestions I'm sure they'll keep improving.
I sent I some dosh on Friday evening, it went through on Monday and withdrew some BTC same time.
They still have a little way to go in terms of user interface but they are taking their AML/KNC seriously which I think means they'll be around for awhile hopefully!
Really crossing fingers that they get an api setup soon, would be good to see the depths and such but otherwise nothing but positive things to say about them (and they're bed in the UK, no SEPA)

Apologies! I was wrong, I had skim read this the other day
(I missed that it was talking about gex and BTC Guild "combined"
..I'm freaking out a little less and now I see why everyone else wasn't as alarmed as I was :)
