pretty straight forward. once they ship it takes around 12 days. But I paid 70 Euros for custom fee. living in France.

1. right, i did not! but also did not receive any payments. so I do not understand why one is zero and other is not!
2. Thanks!
3. let you know if i find out!
4. If I understood correctly they allocate some sat to close channels. 
Thanks a lot!

Hi again,
I got a reply from casa team.  Apparently first question was related with bug of casa node software. Which they fixed by new version. Now, max incoming payment is "0" which would make sense since no one opened channel with me. here   is the all Q&amp;A.
1. In LN transactions section, there are 3 items, first one LN channels  
which shows total BTC on channels, second one max incoming payment which  
also shows some BTC but for max outgoing payment it shows "0". Would you  
please explain what does it mean and impact of this?  
It sounds like you are not running the most recent version of the Casa Node; there was a bug with the Max Incoming/Outgoing Payment logic that was fixed this week. If you log into your node it should prompt you to update.
2. I have opened 3 channels. One is with auto pilot and other two is  
manual. When I add up all BTC, it is less BTC that I transferred in the  
first place. Does it mean I lost some or am i missing something?  
There will be slightly less BTC due to on-chain transaction fees that get paid to miners.
3. How can I track of the payments that used my channels?
We don't expose this level of information, though we probably will in the future.   
4. What happens when you close the channel? In theory you should get all  
BTC you put when you open the channel, right?
If depends upon the state of the channel's balances when you close it. If you have spent more value than you have received on that channel, the on-chain transaction will settle with a smaller balance than you deposited into the channel.

No worries. Thanks!

not much! Is there a thumb rule about the ratio of allocated sats.


I see. Thanks a lot for your explanation!
