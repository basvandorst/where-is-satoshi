you seem to be missing an important fact in this hypothetical. You see, the way getting tortured for information works is: someone hurts you until you tell them the information. If you have to make a call or send an email or whatever, that makes no difference. What do you think your lawyer does when you call him screaming, begging for him to release your funds? 
If there is a way you could access your coins, you will make that happen, because the alternative is being tortured until you die, which is probably super unpleasant.

ARE YOU AWARE BOMB VESTS EXIST?
ARE YOU AWARE POISONS EXIST?
ARE YOU AWARE SCOPOLAMINE EXISTS?
ARE YOU AWARE YOU CAN GO INTO A BANK WITH A GUN IN YOUR POCKET AND NO ONE WOULD KNOW?
Get it through your skull dude. I know plenty of Cholos who would, for $5,000,000, hurt you in ways so profoundly painful and terrifying that you would, within 1 hour, genuinely and gratefully agree to fully cooperate with giving away your bitcoins, not in exchange for your freedom, but for a promise of a quick death.
These people fucking exist.
You are a tasty snack for them.

You should probably spend some time, such as up to 1 hour, learning about the correct and safe way to do a thing when that thing is important or when doing it wrong could result in disaster. 
Wrong way: Google “electrum” and then just download and install one of the things that says electrum on it somewhere.
Right way: Google “official electrum url” and make sure 10 trusted sources that are trustworthy say the same thing. Download from that place. Also download the checksums and signatures files. Actually check that the checksums and signatures are correct.  Then install it.

@_date: 2019-06-26 08:05:10
Up. Sometimes slowly, sometimes quickly, sometimes backwards a step then two steps forward; but up, a lot, for as long as there are still computers and humans. We’ve been telling you this for a decade. Fiat can only endure so much abuse before it dies, or at least faints. When that happens, you’ll literally cry for thinking a $20,000 Bitcoin was imprudent. 
I’ve been saying this since they we’re $300. It’s what the world will use as the bedrock of monetary value from now on. There isn’t that much of it, you should get some if you can, even if it’s only a little. A Bitcoin will be worth a million dollars someday, and 10 million dollars someday. 
Winter is coming, it’s the best solution we have, it’s what we’re going to use when we have to. All the possible futures I can foresee that don’t include very expensive Bitcoins also don’t include things worth buying or people to buy them.
This is happening. Maybe tomorrow, maybe in 50 years, but it’s happening.
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:04:40
I see what you did there.
@_date: 2019-06-26 10:04:08
Because one is a way to buy Bitcoin, and the other is a way to buy a promise from a company that they will buy some Bitcoin for you and you can tell them what to do with it (or with it’s cash equivalent) sometime in the future, for a small fee, assuming they don’t get hacked, or go bankrupt, or are just lying to you.
A legal right of ownership in some company’s theoretical Bitcoin has literally none of the important or innovative qualities of owning actual Bitcoin.

To clarify, dummies offering many X leveraged shorts of Bitcoin without sufficient reserves could cause a financial crisis if Bitcoin goes way up, as it is wont to do. So..., IBanks behaving irresponsibly... which was the whole point of Bitcoin.
How about just... I don't know, don't let your customers gamble with money they don't have..?

@_date: 2019-06-26 08:25:59
You can. Not that big of a deal.
It would be better if you withdraw it to a wallet you control yourself, if you feel comfortable with that and willing to invest a few hours learning how to do that very safely.
Square probably won’t cheat you, but you don’t actually “have bitcoin” until you control the key. Until then, you have a legally binding promise from Square to give you $500 worth of bitcoin sometime in the future. If they go bankrupt, they get to break that promise. They may break it for other reasons that are not allowed. You would then have to buy a lawyer and do a suing to have a judge make them double promise to pay you that $500 which they still might not.
So no rush, but you’ll probably want to learn how to do it yourself so that you don’t have to rely on promises, which is really kind of the whole point.

We don't fucking care what the "price" of Bitcoin is. Once you understand that, you understand how Bitcoin won't fail.
We may well blow it up or fuck it up beyond repair, but the number of BTC you can get someone to send you for a number of USD is never going to be a part of that equation.

Bullshit. They would not be stupid enough to do that.
That's like throwing your steering wheel out the window while playing chicken: You win or everyone dies.

An online marketplace that sold illegal goods on the so-called Dark Web was shut last week following action by international authorities, according to people familiar with the matter.
The closing of AlphaBay, an anonymous marketplace that listed for sale drugs, counterfeit credit cards and other illegal goods, came after coordinated action by the U.S., Canada and Thailand, the people said.
The action included the arrest of Alexandre Cazes, a Canadian citizen who allegedly was one of the site’s operators, they said. He was found hanged in his cell Wednesday in Thailand, people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Caze “passed away in Thailand,” a spokeswoman for Canada’s foreign affairs department said Thursday. She declined to comment further, citing privacy reasons.
Mr. Cazes was taken into custody July 5 in Thailand “with a view toward extradition to face federal criminal charges in the United States,” according to Melissa Sweeney, a spokeswoman with the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok. The same day, members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police’s high-technology crime unit executed a search warrant at a residence in Trois-Rivières, Quebec, said Camille Habel, a sergeant with the RCMP in Montreal.
It wasn’t immediately clear whether Mr. Cazes had legal representation.
Following its creation in December 2014, AlphaBay emerged as an heir to the Silk Road, the online marketplace closed by federal authorities in October 2013. Both sites were accessible via Tor, a network that takes steps to preserve the anonymity of its users.
While the Silk Road’s primary focus was drug sales, AlphaBay was more diverse, selling stolen credit-card numbers, drugs, online-fraud tutorials and guns, according to Andrei Barysevich, a director at Recorded Future Inc., which sells data about online threats and the Dark Web.
In the first six months of 2017, AlphaBay sold more than $5 million in stolen credit-card numbers, Mr. Barysevich said. “AlphaBay was the biggest marketplace on the Dark Web,” he said.
Total sales on the site averaged between $600,000 and $800,000 a day, earning AlphaBay’s operators millions of dollars each year in commissions, according to Nicolas Christin, an associate research professor at Carnegie Mellon University who studies online marketplaces.
AlphaBay’s operators had millions of dollars in the digital currency bitcoin, much of it held in escrow for the site’s illicit transactions, based on two bitcoin wallets that have been linked to the website, Mr. Barysevich said. The site’s abrupt shutdown last week fueled speculation its operators had absconded with millions of dollars of the digital currency.

I find it hard to believe someone could be that shitty.

Interesting read. Tyft.
Though I wouldn't technocally call this an opsec mistake. We all pretty much can guess he mined a ton of the early blocks. Nothin he did there compromised his real identity.

Good conspiracy theory, but you forget that NO ONE, not even Satoshi, saw this comming. Literally no one. Not the most hardcore cryproanarchist. The idea that some paris hilton types foresaw this grand plan is purposterous.

I approached the the bitcointalk guy and admins at sourceforge and offered them large amounts of money to look at their logs. Bitcointalk had none, no pii on sourceforge. I'm sure people looked much harder than i did. Dudes a ghost.

Satoshi himself was consistently unsure it would amount to anything. It took a brilliant mind to synthesize all those pieces, if your new money reptilians were that smart, the would have for sure found a less visible means.

That is beautiful, thank you.
I hope to god it is true. I hope he's alive and well and looks in on what he started every now and again.
