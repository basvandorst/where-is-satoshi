Thank you so much for verifying my calculations, am not good at math, it took me fews hours to complete.  
It's impossible to make a ROI in 3 years or in any future !
In Bitcoin the difficulty increases each 2 weeks, so your daily BTC earning overtime will became irrelevant and they wont cover the daily fees, after 20 days not paying the daily fees Genesis will shutdown your account(it's included in the agreement).
 
Some folks using Genesis advise to buy more hashing power with the profit to overcome the difficulty increase, in my opinion it's just a loop, more hash power= more fees = poor bitcoin earning = no ROI.
Check this [example](
@_date: 2017-02-14 09:19:00
I used this [website]( for that figure, and it's just a reference, you right it will decrease at each difficulty increase. 
Some folks using GENESIS MINING says "that you should invest your profit btc to buy more hashing power to overcame the difficulty  increase",  in my opinion it's just a loop, more hash power= more
fees = poor bitcoin earning = no ROI.
Edit: "Some folks at GENESIS MINING" to "Some folks using GENESIS MINING"

LMAO, I mean Tax evaders !
@_date: 2017-02-15 01:29:53
I hope that the Bitcoin price increase so you can break even. 
But the reality is, many people are being ripoff, so if enough people get tougher to put pressure on them, they may reduce or eliminate their daily fees.  
@_date: 2017-02-14 19:37:39
LOL ! That's so funny ! but the reality is a lot of people are being abused, we should spread this message to the talking head of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-15 03:27:52
It's not about feelings, its about simple Math ! 
I very open minded to see, to how can I make a ROI with you company, with simple math, thank you ! 
@_date: 2017-02-20 03:52:19
Brilliant ! 
I wont answer what already been discussed in this tread.
Have a good read ! 
@_date: 2017-02-15 05:26:09
0.17 $ a day = 62.05 $ a year - the difficulty increase over the year, will make less then 62.05 a year, so no ROI in year ! 
@_date: 2017-02-15 04:55:31
What am saying is, that the daily fee will eventually eat up all the the BTC rewards before and shutdown the contract before you can even make any ROI. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 10:43:40
Thank you for verifying my calculations. As I mentioned in this thread many times (I may edit the OP to include this), with the difficultly increase, the second year, you will not mine 0.1554 BTC at all ! If they keep the same daily fees, IT WILL DECEASE OVER TIME to become ZERO !
 
@_date: 2017-02-14 22:43:30
Thank you very much for sharing your experience, please spread the message out there !

I didn't look at it that way !
@_date: 2017-02-15 04:34:23
Why people will give money if they will not get ROI, isn't that the definition of a scam? and it' not a gamble when by design you will not make ROI. It not compared to Home mining at all, it's definitely not true. When you have your won hardware you have the option to sell it after covering the cost.
@_date: 2017-02-15 05:01:08
Dude ! This is ridicules, how did come up with this ?
750 GH/s = 4 USD a day !!
Please fix your software, to make it that way ! 
@_date: 2017-02-26 19:25:39
They should call the wallet "unfriend", that should me more accurate name.
@_date: 2017-02-15 05:56:57
Sorry for keeping you busy this late ! 
Just to clarify my self again. Am not saying your company is not legit or you can't ROI, I believe your business can be a good solution to invest Bitcoin for long term and protect against Bitcoin price fluctuation. But for now that fees can't make the contracts ROI any future term.
@_date: 2017-02-15 03:20:01
M.Marco Streng, Thank you so much for your reply, I wasn't excerpting any message Genesis Mining, let alone communicating with the CEO, It's a true honor! 
I truly respect your business and your effort to democratize Bitcoin mining, and bring many new people to cryptocurrency echo system. 
I was my self interested in to Genesis Mining, and how easy to get involved into Bitcoin mining, But I was shocked when I found, that's by design, impossible to make a ROI in any future. 
I understand that your business has many ongoing expenses, and charging your clients to offset those costs is necessary for the prosperity of your business. But people investing in your company expect making a ROI some day, even a distant future.
As you know in the agreement, there is two fees, Upfront fee and the daily fee. I assume the Upfront fee cover the cost of upgrading new equipment, and the daily fees cover the **ongoing expenses**. 
But in reality, mining equipment depreciate quickly, and sold right after making their costs, thus reducing considerably their **ongoing expenses** and risk of failure. 
The mining difficulty increase make the hashing power invested obsolete in few weeks, I know you don't have control over that, But the fact the daily fees don't decreases make it impossible for the Bitcoin mined to cover the daily fees overtime, thus bring the contract to zero! 
The only way I can see people making money doing business with your company, regardless of the price Bitcoin, is by reducing the daily fee overtime, thus making ROI in the long term.  ***Edit: and giving the ability to sell the hash power.  
The way I see Cloud Mining, is distributing the cost of the mining hardware and the operating cost among many contacts, to share in the end the Bitcoin rewards equally and proportionally. But in your case, your business is the only beneficiary.

Quick follow up concerning the last paragraph, how the hell did come up with $83 ? Do you know how Bitcoin works ?  
@_date: 2017-02-15 10:30:32
Sweet heart, am not sure how many times I have repeated this ! 
With the difficulty increase over time you will not make the same daily profits. 
So your generous halved profit of 0.17 cent daily, if you keep the same daily fees, 
IT WILL DECEASE OVER TIME to become ZERO ! How many time you need me to repeat this Honey ! 
Am doing to bed too, good night Baby Doll !

My mistake ! I am not used to Reddit text formating.

Or simply the wallet hacks your friend's phone and computer, encrypts all the files until your friend gives you back your money.

But my calculations shows at least for GENESIS MINING, that by design you are at lost from the beginning, no matter what the price of Bitcoin, because of their abusive mining free.   
@_date: 2017-02-26 19:23:43
Encrypting the phone and computer's files with the wallet in case of credit default seems a good solution to me, your "friend" will have a good incentive to give you back your money.

That's a good TLDR !

dude ! why do you keep saying that you business is compared to mining at home, it's definitely not true. 
When you have your won hardware you have the option to sell it after covering the cost, with your company you guys take people by the balls !  
@_date: 2017-02-28 00:06:35
If you don't pay your mortgage, the bank kicks you out from your house, lost your job or sick or whatever,  the house is the collateral. In p2p lending, the phone or the computer is the collateral. in the case of the phone,  the app knows which brand of the phone from the IMEI number, and evaluate the price. If you want to lend money, you know the person collateral assets. In case the borrower default, he just needs to sell the phone on eBay to pay the back the lender. But nothing of this can happen if the borrower just resets his phone, They are solutions for that, like a persistent app, but they are more elaborate to deploy. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 05:44:39
Finally you said the word math ! 
You can buy a Antminer R4 8.6TH/s for ≈ 2000 $ including power supply. Power consumption 845 W at 0.05 Kwh.
Doing the calculation using this [website]( after year you will get  1,234.55 USD in Bit rewards, then you can sell Antminer R4 for 1000 USD (very reasonable price). 
So after a year will made $234.55 11.73% ROI not bad ! 
Even Antminer s7 is still profitable over this year, but it well not keep it value. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 04:09:20
The difficulty is part of the equation, I don't consider your business a  mining gamble, it's a way of investing in Bitcoin for a long term and even protecting people from Bitcoin price fluctuation. 
But right now you guys are riping people off, with the daily fees that eat up most of the BTC reward.
@_date: 2017-02-15 05:13:30
Dude sign me up right away !  But wait a second,  explain to me how you can get 4 USD worth of BTC with 700 GH/s in a day ?  you mean a month, fore sure but even then the fees will kill your profit.

Can a miner cherry pick the transactions that he wants to mine ? 
Even if he is cherry picking, someone could mine those transactions first, and he will not be able to collect he's money back. those are high fees transactions almost a dollar per transaction, he will be loosing a lot. 
@_date: 2017-02-14 23:44:42
That's SAD !
@_date: 2017-02-14 19:45:00
A lot of people ! if you do search on Youtube you will find many YouTuber comparing this to buy Bitcoin. so we need to spread the message, and save people  from this scam ! 
@_date: 2017-02-15 01:13:07
I am sorry to hear that, and thanks for sharing your experiment.
There a lot of people that fell in the trap, you are not alone !
From what I saw in Youtube, people that invest, don't realize that they are being ripoff !
We need send this message to the Bitcoin Community Influencer/speakers so they can Expose GM, and gather as mush people as possible affected by this scam, in my opinion, this is how you can get leverage,*edit: At least to reduce the daily fees or eliminate them. 
To get you money back, Am afraid there is one solution "Class Action Lawsuit". If some people can invest 20$k in GM, I assume they have money to afford Lawyer. 
@_date: 2017-02-20 02:14:41
 &gt;and why are you using vpn?
Dude, this is 2017 everyone use VPN for daily Internet browsing. 
@_date: 2017-02-14 22:32:41
"My browser crashed when I opened your address in blockchain.info" 
Correct me if am wrong (*Edited: I did a big mistake, corrected now), (those are rough estimates):
6 months ago: 
1 BTC ≈ 600 $
3.2 BTC = 1920 $
3.2 BTC = 3,231.73 $
Total BTC revived from MG ≈ 1.16403580 BTC = 1,175.6835 $
If you have kept your 3.2 BTC you would have gained: 1311.73 $ ROI is +68.32%.
With MG investment, you lost = 744.32 $ Your ROI is -38.77%.
That is just insane !!!!, I never seen that before ! To you let you know that figure will decrease over time !  
So here is my advise:
* Fist of all, please move your BTC to a private/secure wallet, you are are at risk of loosing all of your BTC.
* Your ROI is in the negative it's not because of difficulty rate it's because of their ripoff fees, it will reach -62.50% in a year, please spare what is left.
* If you can sell you hashing power do it now ! 
* Cash out a soon as possible ! 
If you any question please feel fee to reach me, and thank you very much for sharing you experience.

Am sorry for what happened to you and hope you get your Bitcoin back, Am just curious what would happen in this scenario: "If they didn't attack, but the girl start screaming and telling to give back her money, then the police came, how can you explain them that you just sent some "Bitcoins" if she denies it ?"
@_date: 2017-02-19 01:26:58
From what I understand, she was sent by her boyfriend, she could easily denies that you sent her the BTC (ie. denies her btc address), therefore she want her money back. The fact that she handed money, does not mean that the trade was complete, she would say that it was for you to count and verify. Am sorry for complicating this scenario that never happened, I just want to opinion in this case.
@_date: 2017-02-15 23:09:15
Quick follow up concerning the last paragraph, why are comparing you business to buying Bitcoin from exchanges ? Your business has noting to offer, if some want to gamble on BTC price fluctuations.
You said it yourself, so stick to that market.
 &gt;it is meant to be compared to: mining from home. 
@_date: 2017-02-14 09:33:29
On YouTube GENESIS MINING is trending as hell, a lot of people buy into that (I head people investing 20k), especially with the btc high price, they think mining is cheaper then buying and fell to that trap. We should spread awareness about this every where. 
When I did the calculation I couldn't believe that by design they are taking advantage of people ignorance.  
@_date: 2017-02-14 20:21:34


Can you please provide the source, If you right I should update my OP. Based on you info the profit for the first year with **Up front fee** is  -56.2318 USD, with **daily fee** -22.518712 USD


I was sarcastic about that, but they will terminate you account in  20 days if your payout don'y cover the fees . 


It's not, you are losing money from the beginning, it's just an illusion of investing.


Am not scamming any one, I spent few hours doing my calculation and checking if I am wrong, for the only sake to saving people money.

Technically it's not a "lifetime contract", as it will end when your daily mining rewards are less than the daily fees. But before that happen,  I hope you will get back your principle in mining as Bitcoin price is on the rise!

You're welcome! It depends, if you're having a substantial amount of BTC, holding is always the right decision. If you're going to gamble, trading is a lot of fun, but you have enter and exit at the right time. For now, the price of BTC is too high I won't recommend.
