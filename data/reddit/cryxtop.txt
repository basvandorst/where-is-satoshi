I was happy to see something mentioned about it, in my local city of Almere. :) They seem to be interviewing a new company that shows people how to keep their bitcoins in cold storage. 
From Google Translate:
ALMERE / JEROEN Oosterheert - The Bitcoin is in the spotlight. The virtual currency exists since 2009 and is used by more and more people and companies. The value has been increased significantly, but it is still relatively unknown. For Patrick Zuijlen of Almere company Bitcoin Cold Storage (BCS) reason to give a lecture.
During which we will discuss interactive lecture include the potential of Bitcoin for entrepreneurs. It is currently so that those applications are still relatively unknown,'' says Van Zuylen. 
Recently, it was tender attention because the trading platform MtGox bankruptcy protection is sought in a court in Tokyo. MtGox last year accounted for about seventy percent of all global transactions to exchange Bitcoin. , Despite this story, I notice that there is more confidence in the currency has come. Today, for example, the value increased again. Bitcoin is admittedly still in its infancy and there has not really been a steady course, but who's going to come. I'm convinced of that.'' The Almere entrepreneur with BCS about a year now. Places to Work in an office in the former Oranjewoud-building in the center of city where flexible office space can be rented, can be paid with the virtual currency. ,, We are not dealers and do not come close to the label bank. We inform people about safe use and facilitate that. We advocate that entrepreneurs themselves keep control and have access to their stored power'' self More information on the lecture on Wednesday, March 12th can be found at.:

Sweet site. Really slick looking. Unfortunately, still not any ATMs in my country (NL) I will keep checking though, maybe one day! ;) Bookmarked.

I'd like to mention, that buying Bitcoin isn't the only way to acquire them. I have been doing freelance work for over a year now, and getting paid in Bitcoin has been awesome. I have cashed a little out, but a large portion (&gt;80%) I spend or save in Bitcoin.

As a person who lives in The Netherlands, this is awesome! :D

In the event you cannot get an ATM set up, I suggest you use Bitonic.nl 
I've used it before and it works really good. ~~It's not instant, but if you order on a weekday you'll have the BTC the same day.~~  EDIT: My bad, it is instant. I was thinking of when I sold BTC through them. I know, dumb. whoops.

Thats funny, because I did the exact same thing a couple days ago. They only accept credit cards, which is kinda annoying. Same with Squarespace.

This is really cool.
@_date: 2014-03-17 20:47:02
Maybe check out :)
@_date: 2014-03-10 10:45:37
Classy :)

I'm 19, and for me, it's allowed me to make some money doing freelance work, and it has also taught me a whole lot about the way money works. I've learned a lot from it. :) It's also what helped me really decide that I wanted to study computer science more.

Thank you! I'll definitely be checking out localBTC and mycelium as well.

Thankfully, i'm not on there. Sad this happened. :/
@_date: 2014-04-05 15:08:27
Awesome, I hope in the future we can expand to other games as well, like League and Dota. :)

My favourite platform for using is Coursera, with EDx being second. I just choose one depending on which courses are available. 
However, like some people have noted, the professors may not be able to accept donations, but the sites themselves could still accept Bitcoin for their signature tracks.

Can't wait to see how these guys are doing in a year or two.  Things are looking really good for them so far.

We need HTML 5 wallets so those not using Android can get a wallet on their phone. :) I know this would get a lot of my friends on board.
@_date: 2014-03-16 11:28:21
That would be awesome. I have participated in many MOOCS, and i'd love to be able to donate Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-20 21:20:03
Can't wait till I can order internationally... might not be such a good thing; I won't be able to stop myself from spending!
@_date: 2014-03-17 20:25:29
When will it be available for purchase?

I didn't lose any money, infact, I gained money (which is only a bonus). I get more bitcoin for my work when the price is lower, and less when the price is higher. For me at least, this has worked out to me ending up with far more overall fiat value, since the price has actually gone up significantly on a year by year basis.
So yes, I lost some fiat value for work I did when the price was high, but I also gained value on work I did when the price was far lower than it is now, so it's worked out in my favour, considerably.
