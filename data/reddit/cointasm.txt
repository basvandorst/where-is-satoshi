if bitfloor would just be more open about what's going on, we could help drag the bank through the mud. but they're being suspiciously quiet. 
it took them this long to admit there is a dispute with the bank. what kind of dispute? why so secretive? there's more than appearances going on here.
@_date: 2013-05-07 05:47:02
ignore the troll
@_date: 2013-06-04 09:34:48
he should never be allowed to run another bitcoin company.
@_date: 2013-05-28 18:48:52
his website says:"we are trying to return the money as quickly as possible."
fuck his life outside bitfloor. what about the lives of people he owes serious money to??
@_date: 2013-05-21 12:16:56
wow u're being downvoted? wtf
@_date: 2013-05-07 05:52:08
the reporter mentioned the $267,000 that was tallied here? that has no relation to the actual net amount.
@_date: 2013-05-07 06:02:58
there can't be a gag order from a dispute with a bank. not unless there are ongoing court proceedings. and from what the spokesman said, there clearly are not.
i'm afraid Roman is just  being sneaky.

the .026 dividend is baked into the .5BTC. the share price should have dropped by about that much ex-dividend.
@_date: 2013-05-29 04:44:29
we've waited a long time already with absolutely minimal and evasive communication from Bitfloor.
It looks they're only trying to stretch it out, which would be advantageous for them.
@_date: 2013-05-24 05:25:52
Roman is obviously a liar, but no one seems to be too bothered.
@_date: 2013-05-13 04:03:14
your naivete is amusing.
@_date: 2013-05-21 12:13:42
A stand-up guy my ass. Why is he cavorting around the fuckin Bay Area, with tweets such as:








while claiming to be "hard at work trying to return your money".

the BTC seller here should be more concerned than the buyer. you should let him know what went down.
@_date: 2013-05-06 07:18:23
thanks for doing this
@_date: 2013-06-04 09:32:21
CapitalOne has already written a check. They're not holding anyone's money.
I think Roman's lawyer is holding the check while he figures out how to get the biggest cut from it.
@_date: 2013-05-28 18:50:32
great hindsight buddy. real 20/20.

audex thanks for putting this update here on reddit. that way we can keep the discussion going.
@_date: 2013-06-07 18:32:56
no guys, roman is not going to cough up our money easily.
@_date: 2013-05-07 06:10:54
nope, it's Roman who's being suspiciously quiet. he should be keeping us informed on what the bank is saying and what he's doing.
@_date: 2013-05-05 06:04:39
too much information
@_date: 2013-05-29 04:46:55
i was able to pull my BTC out the day the shit hit the fan. i guess it was suspended after that. 
i agree that is VERY suspicious. there is no good reason for not returning people's BTC.
@_date: 2013-05-05 06:00:23
in all fairness, if he did that, the price for Bitfloor BTC would go through the roof. trading had to be halted immediately.
@_date: 2013-05-07 05:45:27
do not feed the troll!
@_date: 2013-05-05 05:46:46
If there's someone needs harassing, it's Roman. He's refusing to keep us posted with details. I'd be interested in his phone number, his address and his current location.
@_date: 2013-06-04 09:33:55
we don't actually know that banks are refusing to open an account for them. that's hearsay.
@_date: 2013-05-05 05:54:47
they were working after trading stopped. i got my btc out some 6 hrs after, without issues.
@_date: 2013-05-28 18:49:50
i seriously doubt the problem is a lack of road trips.
@_date: 2013-06-28 06:05:55
Btctip has been around for more than a year, and it works super!
