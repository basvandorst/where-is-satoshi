You sound like someone who bought in at around 20k and probably don’t know the first thing about unregulated markets. Don’t be mad about how the market works just play it right. It will go down.

It’s called a pump and dump with FOMO investors inflating it. The reason was that people wanted to ride the pump and millions of people invested. Then the whales got what they wanted and sold. They will pump again when the price reaches around 2500.

So tell me why it’s down 70%? There are also many news articles that back up my claim if you actually cared enough about your investment to do some research. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:38:19
Because you’re delusional and in denial that you lost 70% of your investment due to FOMO buying

I provided you with a NYT article with a scientific study backing up my claim. Your turn.

Cool that has nothing to do with what I said

5850 to 5900 probably tbh
But seriously that wouldn’t bring in the 700 billion in crypto market cap that we lost still

It was a pump and dump get over it. A pump and dump attracts new stupid investors which amplifies it. There was literally no reason for bitcoin to jump in price so rapidly 10x. Now it will fall ~9x before rising again whenever the whales think is the best time for a pump.

Because they didn’t know when the pump will end but the whales did. They sold and left everyone with -70% returns. But they will pump again

The pump from 2k-20k was a large pump and dump scheme and is currently being investigated by the DOJ.
