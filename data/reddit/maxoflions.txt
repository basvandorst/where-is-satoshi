Congrats kid

Cheers for the info mate. Provides a little reassurance. Which regulations has Trump slashed?

What do you mean by weak hands and whales? And when do you expect it to drop?
@_date: 2017-02-18 17:20:25
Right, but how much do you think the value would decrease if it were to be rejected and why?

Hey mate, cheers for all the info. Who are the other two ETFs proposed by and when are they due a response?
@_date: 2017-02-18 18:34:25
How long do you reckon it would take to recover?
@_date: 2017-02-18 18:33:20
You suggest going for it then?
@_date: 2017-02-18 18:35:54
I'm assuming you mean weak hands as in people who are worried to hold the assets, and whales as in people who own huge amounts.

These are honestly my gut instincts. It's interesting to see that the first article I've seen on this is by SCMP who are based in Hong Kong. I lived in Hong Kong for a good 5/6 years and over the course of my time there, throughout the Umbrella Revolution etc, China has gotten a much firmer grip on Hong Kong's government, and its media (chiefly SCMP).
I've heard that none of the other exchanges have halted trading and BTCC stopped voluntarily. Obviously it'd be worth it considering the value has gone down dramatically overnight.

"Amid reports of blanket ban."
I've heard elsewhere that BTCC stopped trading voluntarily &amp; that other exchanges are doing just fine. SCMP articles are practically written by PoC government - definitely think the price is getting forced down for cheap coins.

Well, I mean, consider how much the value has gone down overnight then consider how much they could possibly make from buying at this price (or a cheaper price), and selling when the 'problem is resolved in China'.

First time I've seen it. Any idea if there's a direct reason?
