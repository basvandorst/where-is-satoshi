They were trading US securities without KYC. Of course the SEC is involved.
@_date: 2018-09-28 03:07:38
They have a US presence if they're trading US stocks. There's laws around trading US securities and they broke them, pretty clear cut.
They don't give a shit about crypto.

Not all users of Gox trade in USD, for some currencies its the only option and it still has the largest volume that isn't in China.
@_date: 2014-01-07 10:55:02
I do find that hard to believe. Try again? They wouldn't pass up an opportunity to make some money off you.
@_date: 2014-04-02 12:44:26
They want to sell before it crashes to hell.
@_date: 2014-01-07 09:04:29
You'll see them. Gox may be a bit silly, but they haven't stolen coins.

Sometimes it does. Depends on the miners.

See your results by using this link:
satoshidice.com/lookup.php?tx=&lt;YOUR BTC ADDRESS&gt;&amp;limit=100&amp;min_bet=0&amp;status=ALL
You're returned a small amount back when you lose.

@_date: 2013-05-30 14:52:15
That too. People are complaining more about the inconvenience I think
@_date: 2013-05-04 14:49:05
Looking at 600 BTC for first orders...
Still, 90 GH/s if you used all of them at once...
@_date: 2013-04-25 00:35:51
I'm a little concerned. Trades seem to be going through, and my documents got verified almost instantly.
@_date: 2013-04-28 23:11:53
I'd love to use it except it refuses to pair with my QR code...
@_date: 2013-06-04 09:01:59
You can casually mine for fun, but you won't turn a profit unless you do spend some money (upwards of $1,000) on some hardware.
GPU mining is becoming not profitable compared to newer FPGA and ASIC mining driving up the difficulty.

It's just too small a market here I think. I'm amazed Gox has the support for Australia as they do, it's the only decent one out there.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:33:06
I'm with you mate, so bloody hard to buy BTC in Australia.
@_date: 2018-12-16 05:45:51
Good thing SEC rules mean fuck all for Bitcoin
@_date: 2013-04-18 05:37:28
The more expensive isn't always better. You need a high count of stream processors rather than raw power.
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:21:48
MtGox is about our only option for deposits. Unless you want to have a 8-10% commission on buying BTC here. 
@_date: 2013-06-03 12:33:54
Ripple is a scam.
@_date: 2013-05-22 02:27:17
It would take 103 days to recoup your expenditure on that unit, not accounting for difficulty increases. Not worth it...
@_date: 2013-05-10 06:15:05
"le blockchain" why.
@_date: 2013-05-23 10:40:17
Still going?
Love the interface and how everything works. Great job, much better than most other games.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:49:47
All Australian buying BTC are going from Gox's closing price, once it opens in 10 minutes everything will update. It sucks, but there are no other decent Australian exchanges or ones that allow for Australians other than Gox.
@_date: 2013-07-31 13:11:08
Or people outside the USA...
@_date: 2013-05-02 09:50:34

It's a bitcoin casino game, the most popular.
@_date: 2013-04-17 08:39:21
I'm hoping lower. We'll see.
@_date: 2013-05-30 14:24:57
Bitcoins don't require verification. Turning existing money into Bitcoins does. And MtGox want to stay within the law, hence why they do this.
You can use another exchange.


That's a form of verification, since your card number and billing address holds all your information for them. Plus, a credit card company also must have verified you to give you that card.
@_date: 2013-05-22 02:33:43
You'd need an escrow service to minimise scam attempts.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:56:11
No. It needs to be "bitcointip"
@_date: 2013-04-15 00:27:07
Because people outside the USA and EU are extremely limited in where they can exchange, Gox being the only one to take a wide range of payment options from many countries.
@_date: 2013-04-29 00:32:28
I know. I am scanning the correct code. On my phone I hit "Pair Device" and scan the code and it puts me back at the screen with the buttons "Pair Device" and "New Account". 
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:20:32
As someone living in Australia, MtGox is the only exchange that will take my money and not rip me off.
@_date: 2013-07-04 10:35:08
Looks like a great idea!
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:48:00
Instant for me. No issues withdrawing BTC over here.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:24:08
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:03:50
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:24:24
Will do, thanks for the link.
@_date: 2013-06-06 03:22:50
It applies to creating API keys, and you can set what different abilities API has. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:01:47
Yes, but it limits after a while, and the payout isn't so great.
