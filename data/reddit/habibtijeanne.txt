You should always read the terms &amp; conditions.  Read between lines and understand the risks that they are disguising.  Also, US laws only apply if the company is incorporated there.

IFF that company is incorporated in the US.  That's what people don't understand.  I don't know know why anyone would think that US laws can be applied worldwide?

And don't use easily hacked email service like gmail for valuable data.  I use protonmail because they offer two passwords.

You don't seem to understand how any of this works.  Educate yourself before you risk anything more.

A lawyer would certainly take his money and tell him they would file some papers, etc.  But US laws only apply in the US.  
Come on man, think about it

You must have agreed to their Terms &amp; Conditions without reading them.  I'm guessing that you made a mistake and expect Bittrex to fix it for you.  If you don't have the ability to understand that this is your own fault, then I suggest you educate yourself before purchasing any crypto.

I took a picture of my passport and sent it to an exchange using a different google account.  That passport photo showed up as my PROFILE photo on google+.  I certainly didn't put it there.  The google accounts were not linked by anything.  Different names, phone number, everything.  So I just figure that google has ways of data mining that I never heard of before.
