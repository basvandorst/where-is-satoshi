The thing is, if Darian is indeed the real Satoshi, he still wants to preserve his anonymity. So obviously he would log on to one of his old accounts to clear his own name. This proves nothing at all.

The crazy thing is mtgox doesn't even need USD to cover these buy orders! Any way it takes months to get fiat withdrawals processed. They can just credit their own mtgox account with pretend money and use it to "pay" their own customer balances for cheap coins and just credit the customer's account. Anyway they can't actually withdraw fiat. LOL. What a fucked up situation we're all in.
That's probably what they've been doing all along, which is why it's been taking months to get money out of them for a while now.
@_date: 2014-03-18 03:46:46

@_date: 2014-03-07 05:36:44
I disagree. The guy came out of hiding after all this time because shit just got real. I think the odds of Darian being the real Satoshi increased significantly due to the latest message from the "real" Satoshi.

BCH already 2500....
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:04:29
4000 by Monday. This will only get worse. 150,000 unconfirmed transactions. That hash power will not come back so easily. This will only pile up. Makes selling much more difficult and will completely devastate the exchangers. This is what happens with a crypto run on the bank. Buckle up
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:11:07
I sold it all at $4500, needed money to fund a nice little startup. Might buy back in at $1000.
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:15:22
As I said, very different from real companies who produce shit people want resulting in real revenue and cash flow.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:37:08
Nah, not this time. Not when miners have less incentive to come back. They will stay with a more profitable coin.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:08:21
When everybody wants OUT. In real life they line up for ATMs with lines going around the block. This is the same here - people can't move coins and the unconfirmed transactions keep piling up. This won't get better any time soon. Hash power is on BCH now, more than 50% has moved
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:57:30
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:35:31
Yes. The lower the price of Bitcoin goes the less incentive miners have to come back. IF they don't, the backlog of unconfirmed transactions will only grow larger. And the larger it grows, the more confidence people will lose. It's a vicious cycle.

There's no reason for it to stop though. The more unconfirmed transactions pile up (140,000 now), the worse this gets. And there are now more miners for BCH. This is a total shit show
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:28:04
LOL you people are delusional... 140,000 unconfirmed transactions. 33 per second. And you people look at Bitcoin and say hey look it's a $100B market cap. That number is meaningless. There is no $100B worth of Bitcoin circulating. More like $100 MILLION. The moment a selloff starts, it sinks instantly. This is complete fiction. Can't ever get to any sort of real adoption outside of the pump and dump speculators with measly 33 transactions a second. Stores in a small neighbourhood in any random NFL city in the US does more.

@_date: 2017-11-12 05:24:32

@_date: 2017-11-12 05:26:52
It can't rally with this many unconfirmed transactions. And with a big price drop the miners won't be back easily. The backlog of unconfirmed transactions will kill Bitcoin either this round or the next.

Point is, it will be rare to own 1 whole bitcoin in the future. With the amount of consolidation and fast accumulation of wealth among top few, I wouldn't be surprised if in reality there were as few as 1 or 2 million actual coins circulating among the public in the future.

@_date: 2017-05-30 04:23:06
Well, way I see it, you can set aside $2000 and put in a kid's college fund - or you can make sure in 20 years from now they own 1 whole bitcoin. Can be worth $0, can be worth $2000, can also be worth $100K. Either way, if bitcoin is still around, having 1 whole coin will be priceless.
@_date: 2017-05-30 02:27:58
But that doesn't matter. Still, there are only 3 to 5 million bitcoins to be had by regular individuals, at most. Only 3-5 million people can say "I own one whole bitcoin".

Electrum. Export your private keys, transform each key to the 64-char hex value, convert that to an integer, and then start a simple lookup of all 10 million values before and after your own hex value. You will find other people's addresses. Do it to all your private keys and let it run. After a day you will have collisions.
Address: 15DTFio6WKG5HRHfRQNXXVhFroDbWwxJgp
Private key: 5JSTpckYPqsPRxrkV3zZzVKMJFNGfVu9JWX721QXTMb5Wr82mSf
Hex: 5224af20889ac590f79ca68588689d873ef60b206b33da6025ace0c90705c0b8
Int val of hex: 37154468760874988449110293609706090360941268111629659303434866284112583704760
Add and substract 100000000 to that last int, generate the private key and then address for each of those and test against a dump of all address with balances from a bitcoind.
Wallets such as Electrum don't generate their private key from 1 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935. They stay within a much smaller bound somewhere in between.
Pretty quickly you end with a dump like

The average person is beyond stupid. I expect a ton of people getting into bitcoin to end up losing all their coins by misplacing paper wallets, malware infested computers, hard drive crashes, failure to tell loved ones about bitcoin holdings prior to death, etc.
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:51:59
I think every bitcoin holder should have a plan for what happens to their coins when they die. There should be a service where you have to check in every few weeks or however long you set it to by SMS or logging into the account. And if you miss a check-in, we notify your emergency contact with whatever message you left in your settings (like "Mom, Dad, I have bitcoins. Surprise! I'm dead, but anyway there's a paperwallet under Amy's mattress.. Uncle Jim will know what to do.")

IMHO it is doomed to fail simply because central banks will figure out how to manipulate the prices enough to scare the public away from this "unstable illicit currency".

I don't get people who keep their coins at an exchange, even at a relatively "safe" place like Coinbase. Why would you do that? Too many things can go wrong. You want to trade - fund it and play around. But if you're keeping coins for more than 12 hours why the hell would you let someone else keep them safe for you.
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:59:00
Doesn't take a lot of coins to cause a drop like that. That's why part of me thinks central banks are hoarding coins and dump them on the market in a few weeks or months to scare off the mainstream adoption.

This is a known A/B test that they're running. They do this to see if it increases their profitability. It usually goes away after a few hours so be sure to keep refreshing. I would advise absolutely to never agree to this type of transaction with Coinbase. Never ever. Do Not.

You know where the money went. The problem is, you can never know who controls that address. It's possible that he will turn to an exchanger to get funds out and provide identification, but I doubt you will be able to find out where he's exchanging to cash and get anyone to cooperate with your request. Even if you do, it will be too late. At this level of theft, there is really nothing that can be done.

It's in fact possible. The conventional wisdom is that the likelihood is essentially zero, but I disagree. The password I think you are referring to is a feature of your software wallet. If someone has your private key they can transfer the balance of an address regardless of physical access to your wallet file/paper wallet.

We will see regulation introduced into the traditional banking system to deal with people who transact in bitcoins.

In fact, I am certain that will be the case.

I've been thinking about this type of currency for months now. I think it sounds dumb at first but can actually be a major breakthrough like bitcoin was in 2009.
What about humans describing complex images, for example? Instead of having computers verify the responses, you can match responses to those of other users and after a certain threshold reward coins accordingly. You'll have to solve the possibility of collusion, but overall I think this concept has a lot of merit and I intend to develop it further.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:48:36
30 days after your first successful purchase you are elevated to Level 2 which lets you buy up to 10 BTCs per week. It used to be 1 BTC per week for new accounts but they recently reduced the limit to 0.1 BTC.
Edit: Coinbase does let you cancel the pending order until its expected completion date and time. So if you see the price skyrocket to $1200 tomorrow you can just cancel it with Coinbase.

You can buy up to $500 in a single pre-paid visa/mc debit card at any supermarket in the US without supplying any identifying information for card activation (some do require, many don't). So you could set a low-ball limit for the BTC cards as well and get away with it.

So what if it takes a week to get the coins? I don't understand people. These days it takes 2-4 weeks to have an intl. wire received and credited at an exchanger like Bitstamp, during which you have no way of locking in the price. 
At least with Coinbase you are quoted an exchange rate at the time of purchase. Use them, it's easy and safe. Just make sure you set your real name in the settings there somewhere and don't mess around logging in with odd IP addresses. And make sure you verify as much info there as possible. All this will ensure that they don't fuck with you and cancel your transactions.

Why retarded? Bitcoins cannot be printed, they have to mined, right? Same here. People can have the daemon open on their computer or even on their phone and whenever they have free time they fire it up and respond to tasks they are given. That's how new coins are introduced into the system. It solves the problem of early adopters and owners of mining rig operations having an advantage. Any person can solve these problems and they get more and more difficult, and the more difficult ones earn more coins. So smart folks will end up with more coins I guess.
If anything, why do *you* think this is retarded? I'm sure bitcoin itself sounded retarded to 99% of people back then.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:02:27

You are correct that there's no way to convert an address into its private key. However what I'm trying to explain here that an effective way to brute force your way into active address is by intermittent and rolling hex value range scanning. So that instead of random hash generation an attacker would pick mid-range hex value, scan a pre-determined range in both directions and then move on to another mid-range. The likelihood of landing on a range previously used by a wallet software is *significantly higher* than the odds of 1 out of 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935 which is essentially the method used by vanity generators and existing brute-force attacks.

The interesting thing is that we haven't seen the flood of orders from them for two reasons: one is some will have to wait to verify their checking account by waiting to see the Coinbase test deposits. Two: many opt for a first time small test transaction. With the holidays it's going to take 7 calendar days for Coinbase to deliver the coins. First time buyers cannot place any new orders until their first one completes.
So the money from them will only start flowing next week.

I use hex values that are way lower or way higher than the range used by software wallets. Even vanity address generators suffer from this problem so brute-force attacks are faced with the same limitation at this point in time.

So I'd use something shorter like 70180319550634459220290495268449502406826110. You can use a physical dice or just ask your kid to think of a digit and append it each time.

You could, but I meant hashing the serial number with sha512() before the usual sha256() for a brainwallet password.
But it's unnecessary unless your buddies are nerds. Just add a word or two to the serial number and you should be fine. Then tell them to go to bitaddress.org and find out the address and key for their brain wallet.

The problem is getting started with the exchanges. Even if you want to wait it out, I think your best move is to establish accounts with the large exchanges, get yourself fully verified, and perhaps even wire some funds so you can make quick moves when you're ready.
Even with Coinbase - sign up, buy a small amount, so at least your account will be in good standing and fully verified in time for your large transactions.

Not true. At all.
For example, with Electrum, it mostly generates private keys that are derived from hex values of integers that are 77 characters long if represented as a string. So the range is MUCH smaller than the theoretical odds of 1 in 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935 for a collision.

It will be sooner than people think.

This is not true. The day we realize this by having someone take over a large address is the day bitcoin is destroyed. That day is coming.

Makes no sense. What I'm trying to explain here that an effective way to brute force your way into active address is by intermittent and rolling hex value range scanning. So that instead of random hash generation an attacker would pick mid-range hex value, scan a pre-determined range in both directions and then move on to another mid-range. The likelihood of landing on a range previously used by a wallet software is significantly higher than the odds of 1 out of 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935 which is essentially the method used by vanity generators and existing brute-force attacks.

Sure it takes a few days to get your coins, but your price is booked and guaranteed (unless they fuck you over, which they do sometimes). That's better than going with Bitstamp and waiting a week or two for your international wire to clear, during which the price may go higher by the time you can actually place a buy order (or lower, obviously). I use both, and Coinbase is very handy when I tell my friends about bitcoin.

My friend's dad just opened a coinbase account and is buying $5K worth of coin. He still uses Windows and has an old Nokia phone as his primary. His co-workers are going to follow. Random example, yes, but this is going mainstream and *fast*. My $3K estimate is probably very conservative IMHO.

My bad, I thought you were talking about the bullshit tactic Coinbase usually employs, which they do right now:
"Note! We've exceeded our normal buy limits for today. If you would still like to purchase you will receive the market price of bitcoin on Thursday Dec 5, 2013 at 10:55AM PST after your funds have arrived."
In your case the exchange rate is indeed locked and your bitcoins will be delivered as promised. In your situation you had 5 minutes to cancel and that's already past. Even if the rate goes up or down, Coinbase is committed to the rate they sold them at.

Got my wires in and waiting for the dips to buy more. I had my price checker python script text me in the middle of the night yesterday to buy at 850.

Bitcoin makes it hard for banks to cook their balance sheets. So they're scared.

Electrum was just an example I used. I've seen the same behavior even with the way bitcoin-qt generates addresses.

Working on it. I suspect it will devalue bitcoin overnight. Expect to hear about it in a month :)

Millions of people all over the world are going to sleep these days thinking the same thing. "If only I had heard about it", "if only I was open minded enough to try", "fuck me for not jumping in".

The problems to be solved will not be math problems necessarily. Bitcoins also started off being worthless. An incentive for people to start mining coins by hand would be to be part of a new type of digital currency and one where they don't have to compete with well-established mining rigs. Here every person's ability is essentially equal to the rest. No one can become a whale just by using a bunch of graphics cards at the university's computer lab after hours.

See my post from today: 
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:58:43
There can only ever be 21 million people on this planet that will be able to hold 1 whole BTC. If you consider the large exchangers, early miners and whales (just the top 500 addresses hold 4 million BTCs alone, that's not counting the big holders who split into many addresses) I imagine the general public will only be able to get a hold of maybe maybe 8 million BTCs AT MOST. Of those, many will hold more than one. So, I imagine only 3-5 million people on earth will ever hold at least 1 BTC - ever. Considering 7 billion people, you're going to be one of the lucky ones.

Don't forget MtGox can't send money to the US.

Don't try to time the market. You're lucky it's 840 today. Could have easily been 900 or 1150. If you're here for the long run just buy. That's my opinion. Or don't, it will for sure be in the high 700 later today.
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:25:45
**Do not do this until you fully verify your Mt Gox account**. They require accounts to be verified before withdrawing funds, even bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:00:29
It is supposed to be, but isn't. Most if not all of your private keys are within the same range. In reality the generation of keys is not as random as it should be. Even with the 128-bit seed the hex value will fall in the mid range between 1 and 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935 and rarely go out of bounds.
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:31:44
Yes, hashes are very similar because the hex values are sequential in my example. The addresses are indeed very different from each other, unlike the private key.

**2216824** addresses with a balance as of yesterday, although 896323 of them had a balance of 0.00009 BTC or less. In total, 1972439 addresses have a value of less than 1 whole BTC. 72303 have a balance of between 1.00000000 - 1.99999999 BTC. 38399 addresses have an exact balance of 50.00 BTC and since most of those have been inactive since 2009-10, they likely belong to very few early miners.
This leaves 133683 addresses with over 2 BTCs not including the dormant/inactive early mining addresses.
71530 of those have between 2.00 and 9.99 BTCs, which means 62153 addresses hold 10 BTCs or more (again, not including those old mining addresses).
I don't think there are 1 million unique BTC holders of addresses with a value.

Unless governments intervene in one way or another, I see 1 BTC == $75K before 2016 and doubling that every couple of years until it doesn't.

I gave a friend 0.5 BTC for Hanukkah and he proceeded to deposit that into Just Dice and gamble it away in 1 bet.

I know you still have ways to buy in China, but the idea that payment processors and banks can tell you what you can't or can do with your money is outrageous. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:05:27
They will kill bitcoin by manipulating the price. They will do that in 2014 by first inflating it through exchangers, or even better, buying directly from a whale, and then flooding the market with them.
@_date: 2013-11-26 18:05:50
You might be waiting a long time.
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:45:24
Pretty simple. Those who sell by December 31st 2013 will have to report and pay taxes by April 15, 2014. But if you sell on January 1st, you have a year and a half almost, until April 15, 2015, to report and pay taxes on your BTC profits, during which you have time to consult with CPAs and wait for official guidance from the IRS before overpaying.
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:55:36
This is one where they ask for strict regulations. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:46:37
That's why the market cap indicator is utter bullshit. There wasn't $12 billion dollars circulating in bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:11:17
So as everyone will tell you, it's essentially impossible. However, it will happen one day, either by mistake (same privkey gets generated by your wallet software) or by brute-force. And when it does, it will either go away quietly or make headlines that will make bitcoin users panic and look for the exit door.

Reminds me of something funny that happened yesterday. Somehow the PIN feature was disabled in my Coinbase iphone app. We were at a restaurant and I gave my daughter my phone to look at some photos. Thing is she always messes with it and opens apps and what not. When we got home and I logged into my Coinbase account I realized she placed an order for 5 BTCs without even realizing it. It's okay, it was at the high 800 range.. so no worries. No wonder Apple fucking kicked this app off the app store.

Welcome to Mr. Obvious.
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:19:54
Restricting exchangers with banking regulations, especially at an early stage like the one we're in. If people can't or have to go through a lot of trouble converting fiat into bitcoin or otherwise fear that they will be unable to convert back to their local currency at some point in the future should they require access to their money - it's doomed. Sure you can pay for stuff using BTCs and that will only increase, but 99% of people are still old-school that way.
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:23:13
That's why you mix it up a bit and add another hashing layer instead of a simple one round of sha256. Or you can prepend a word like "gift" or "tothemoon" to the serial number.
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:47:05
Hmm that's not a bad idea at all... you can even have them on a monthly recurring installment this way. Then after the lockup period is over they're free to do as they wish with the coins. If during this time they dispute the charge or somehow reverse it - poof, the coins disappear from their account. I like it.
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:36:00
I like my idea better.

I think he's doing that. The delay is probably the initial generation. I'm sure he's holding the couple million addresses with value in Redis and checks on each page load.
