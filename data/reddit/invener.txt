Well, this is not necessarily true. Not taking the potential risks involved in mining themselves or taking a chunk of the generated bitcoins could make sense.

You don't need to deal with direct government regulation of bitcoin, as it is decentralized. This also means that bitcoin is not dependent on any one country, meaning that a failure of one system doesn't mean a large failure of bitcoin as well.

That's intriguing, but I'm not sure what to make of it. Wouldn't the properties of bitcoin be useful for people transferring large amounts of money too?

That depends upon where you're keeping them, but I'll assume you have them in Gox.
I really don't know how to help you if that's the case.
@_date: 2014-02-14 05:19:27
Wow, did you buy a ton then?
@_date: 2014-02-15 16:34:54
Thank you!

Just keep it in your wallet.
There are some rather encouraging predictions that the price will jump anywhere from 800% to 800000% by the end of the year. 
It will fluctuate, but there's not obvious reason (to me, at least) that it won't go back up again, especially when it catches on with more regular folks than us.
I have to say, though, I would hate to be in your position as well.

Why did you post this here?
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:56:27
This is literally the most sensible thing that I've ever seen on the internet. Thank you.

Happy valentine's day, Gox!

That was a little bit harsh, man.
Be cool, it's just a couple of people trying to also make a valid point.
@_date: 2014-02-14 05:00:23
Where's the link?
@_date: 2014-02-16 16:10:33
How are they alienating their users? Do we have any idea of the number of people that want to use a non-web application on an iPhone to do this? I suspect that it's a much smaller number than the people that complain about it online, who may just use it to complain about Apple.
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:45:42
Yeah, but it seems nearly impossible to not be a sheep.
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:34:43
Is that to suggest that you are one as well?
@_date: 2014-02-14 04:17:19
Who are you referring to?
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:48:15
Why would you try to post it there? Try r/gifs.

Try CoinBase, thought it takes 4 business days for them to transfer you the bitcoins unless you give them both credit and debit card numbers.
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:40:55
This sounds like a whole lot of fun!
@_date: 2014-02-14 14:10:22
Try Coinbase, they're pretty easy and straightforward.
@_date: 2014-02-14 22:14:09
Y U BRAG SO MUCH?
@_date: 2014-02-14 05:21:54
Sorry, I just wanted to be sure
@_date: 2014-02-16 16:07:25
Of what beliefs?
@_date: 2014-02-14 21:47:43
If you add a credit card to Coinbase, it should be an instant purchase. That is, if you didn't just make the account.
@_date: 2014-02-18 19:27:36
Why not?
@_date: 2014-02-14 04:07:06
NEIN!!! You can't get anything out of Mt. Gox right now, their prices are not representative of the actual value of bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:29:03
What do you mean?
