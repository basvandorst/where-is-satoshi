Wikipedia already has problems attracting new editors. The idea of requiring people to *pay* to edit is ludicrous.

Wikipedia doesn't judge "worthiness". Kim Kardashian is famous, so she gets an article, *even though* the reasons for her fame are absurdly stupid and shallow.
Wikipedia strives to be neutral, and one of the ways in which it's neutral is by judging articles for inclusion through availability of good sources rather than some subjective argument about worthiness or relevance. On availability of sources alone, Kim Kardashian is clearly "notable", and I can say that entirely separate from my personal distaste for and disinterest in her.

Uh, was Wikimedia ever with Namecheap? [As I recall, they use MarkMonitor](

On Wikipedia, "notability" is jargon. See [Wikipedia:Notability (people)](
In particular, this bit from the start of the "Basic criteria" section is important:


It goes on to include discussion of trivial vs. in-depth coverage by those sources, people notable for only one event, and some other issues that influence the judgement of notability, but that's the core of it: the question is "do there exist enough good sources to build a solid, verifiable article?" rather than "is this person *worthy*?".

Actually, when notability is unclear, the opinion of the subject can factor into a decision to delete the article. From [Wikipedia's biographies of living persons (BLP) policy](

Wikipedia admin here. Not interested in cryptocurrency, but occasionally I troll for threads with misunderstandings like this.
There's very little chance this subject would deserve an article. Specifically, it's just a random meme at the moment, and most memes, even popular ones, don't meet Wikipedia's standards. You'd need several reputable third-party sources to directly document the meme to have any chance of meeting the sourcing requirements ("notability" in Wikipedia jargon). As far as I can see, that's got a snowball's chance in hell to happen.
