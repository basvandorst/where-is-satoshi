Gotcha :) Best of luck with any future wallets!

Sounds like a great System of a Down Song waiting to happen

Ever spend 30 minutes trying to find the right porn to fap just to cum while the video decides to buffer? Yeah me too. Let me create a custom fantasy video exactly to your specifications for bitcoin :)

Can tokens be cashed out into btc? (I hope so)
@_date: 2014-05-25 01:17:08
If I read correctly this was a trailer/short film for a full length project. But I was surprised to see bitcoin used so casually in it since his other projects are very youtubey/vlog/challenge centered
@_date: 2014-07-17 03:02:18
Looks good! I would have gone with blue thread for the top-stitching, however. The white sticks out a bit to me :)
@_date: 2014-07-20 02:33:24
Yeah girl! I wish all my customers paid in btc :( but at least the more times I mention it the better. Even a few regulars are looking into it now! Yay!
@_date: 2014-05-11 07:19:05
I want one! But the cut is just awful.... The shorts are such an awkward length!
@_date: 2014-05-01 18:35:02
We are trying :) help show us there is a demand for bitcoin sexual content by stopping by r/girlsgonebitcoin sometime :) I would prefer to take 100% btc payments instead of amazon etc
@_date: 2014-05-10 02:23:54
Do we get a discount if we buy in bulk?
@_date: 2014-05-11 17:59:38
Wow IRL [r/girlsgonebitcoin](
@_date: 2014-05-06 03:49:20
Gee, thanks. 
@_date: 2014-10-15 14:30:07
Yay great tutorial :D just had someone new pay with btc and wish it was all that way
@_date: 2014-11-20 15:09:56
r/sexsells 
@_date: 2015-02-25 15:13:51
Pllllease make this happen. The custom adult content creators on reddit like myself are trying to get our customers to pay in bitcoin, often offering discounts or free videos but we would love to have an anon site for hosting video clips for sale in btc! Most of those other sites require scans on your driver's liscence on file to sell, which is a no go for most of us who don't show our faces... If you ever need some content creators, feel free to check out and the other selling subs!

One of my main arguments was seansoutpost/satoshiforest and how you could donate small amounts and directly make a difference but they seemed unimpressed. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:06:40
It's important to note that you are limited to $65 a day paypal deposits for a new account and the btc withdrawals are manually checked and clear within 48 hours. (Not instant)
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:29:44
Thanks was just about to deposit cash with bit instant but luckily saw this post in time D:
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:20:54
Interested! I was looking for a way to buy with some money sitting in my paypal :D Thanks!
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:45:18
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:14:56
Ah thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:01:39
She ;)
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:38:23
Nope I created my account today and made my first deposit about 10 minutes later.
@_date: 2013-07-12 14:54:25
Looks good now :D
@_date: 2013-05-10 11:20:23
A blonde walks into a bar.

@_date: 2013-04-09 16:52:39
I just deposited $65, had it appear in my bitfloor account, bought btc, and transferred it into my wallet within the hour. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:02:16
Count me in
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:45:06
I definitely agree about the adult industry being a big factor in BTC mainstream success. I mean, hey, look what porn did for VHS tapes ;D
@_date: 2013-05-10 05:08:47
I'd be posting to gw a lot more often if tips were involved!
@_date: 2013-11-24 04:42:26
Earned like 2~, bought 10 at an average price of $100, Another 5 at an average of $300. Would have another 4+ that got lost to inputs/coinlenders. Overall, up several times my initial investment
@_date: 2013-06-23 21:26:34
PM'd you!
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:01:31
I put in little of my own money (maybe 1/11 of what it's now worth) and don't plan on returning the amount to fiat again. So yeah I'd be a little bummed but I knew the risk going in. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:15:54
Sounds like fun! 1PLVpMdrs4RUQ1RcRK1yfa5Uu5F2Adg3gi

$700,000? Link to the discussion?
@_date: 2013-11-29 03:40:48
I planned to take them all on vacation now that cheapair accepts btc ;)
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:10:20
Yup. Actually, girlsgonebitcoin is what got me into BTC ;D
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:23:52
Hmm I don't have an avatar though and it's asking me for an avatar name?
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:28:02
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:25:05
Haha girlsgonebitcoin is what got me into bitcoin and now all my tips i earned there are 1/5 of the original value i was tipped at haha...
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:14:00
Worth a shot :) I got my first $16 of btc from tips (started posting a few days ago) Then I got hooked and put some of my own money in ha. But considering a $1 tip from 3 days ago is now worth $1.30, I'd highly recommend it.
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:27:17
Guess it varies. My first transfer took 40+ hours.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:57:04
Have you considered ? It's a fun way to spread sex positivity and BTC at the same time. Though... I feel like the only person posting there though lol... XD Don't want to dominate the whole subreddit.
@_date: 2013-07-19 00:31:20
“sing in with Facebook" small typo :)
I've put a good amount of btc into CoinLenders as well and look forward to seeing how they grow. I locked in a 90 day CD a month ago at 26.050% APR and have a smaller amount earning daily interest (debating another CD). Thanks for the informative article!
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:21:02
Went through in 15 minutes for me.
@_date: 2013-07-12 14:51:49
Your link for step 4 is broken :)
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:40:20
Also going to ask the reverse of this question, from BTC to USD.
@_date: 2013-05-10 02:55:05
I don't think I've ever seen a bitcoin tip on Gonewild, only on girlsgonebitcoin / decrypto ...
@_date: 2013-05-10 14:03:22
Just the tip? ;D
