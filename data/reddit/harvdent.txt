when someone outside the bitcoin world receives a tip for content. then realizes that he just got paid .02 for something done for free it will inspire that person to create more content more tips ..  only the dumb people will say .. hey u just gave me 3 cents for that joke .. how annoying ur a spammer !! think about it guys ;)

we cant know what the better solution is .. its too early but its a lil naive to say that Bitcoin has to be the solution.  Decentralized blockchain technology. some will be adapted by corporations, some will be cryptos that turn into corporations in venture capital kind of way. others will be big banks and corporate owned or a mixture of both .. ie: money gram coin so diversify and invest in yourself
