The inherent promises in the potential of Bitcoin are so mind blowing, one hardly dares hope it comes to be.
Most of those who really get it must suppress their hope and vision for a world ruled by a decentralized system inherently fair truth and just, lest they become crazed evangelists for a world that might not come to be.  
So we bide our time by focusing on price or coding or legal issues.  Anything more would surely wear out the soul prematurely.

25 coins per block,  1 block every 10 minutes = 6 blocks x 25 coins = 150 coins per hour  x $235 = $35,250 worth created per hour.
@_date: 2015-06-24 14:29:32
@_date: 2015-06-15 05:18:22
So assuming that btc has reached a steady state price equilibrium at $235 per coin, then that implies $35,250 / hour is the average amount of fiat that the global population has decided to pump into btc per hour. If only half as many coins are available after a halving, then that's an extra $423k buying pressure per day added to the market cap, Due to only half as many coins being mined. (Assuming steady state of 'fiat leaking into btc'  buying pressure) 
Once all coins mined, if same $ buying into btc per day was still happening, market cap would rise by $846k per day.
So $846k added per day divided by the 21 million coins = 4 cents per coin price increase per day, or about $14.70 price increase per year (which by then would actually be chump change, but if it were still based on our silly thought experiment where btc price happened to still be today's $235, would be a 6% ROI per year.  Of course, the fact that price and demand won't stay the same makes this all nonsense.. But a fun thought experiment nine the less.

Gavin is an early hero and one of the founding fathers of bitcoin.  Regardless of your feeling on the CSW or CIA issues, the fact that he's catching any shade on r/bitcoin is pathetic.  The good he's done for bitcoin far outshines any such shade.
I'd very much like to see Gavin return to the spotlight, but I can certainly understand why he'd rather keep his life simple and avoid all sorts of petty BS.

Initially there will a lot of margin calls in the financial system as everyone rushes to deleverage their portfolios... which means one of the first thing the day traders and hedgefunds would sell is something like bitcoin... so I'm suspecting there would first be a massive sell off...   then perhaps it would honeybadger again in time if was widely adopted as an alternative to the old system.

The US dollar is the most dominant currency on the globe, so the post is about if btc instead were equal to the most dominant world reserve currency, what would the purchasing power of 1 btc be.  When your countries currency takes over as the dominant world reserve currency that almost all global trade is transacted in (it won't be the USD forever), then you can rewrite the post.   It's not about US centric think... Just happens to be the biggest most widely used currency there is by a long shot.)

All valid concerns... and I'm concerned about all these points too.  It's too slow.. not nearly secure enough, and needs some sort of consumer protection.  Solutions to these problems should probably be built into the core protocol... not scabbed on by layers of jury-rigged patches.   If you fix all those, do you still have bitcoin?  Perhaps a new digital currency that implements lessons from bitcoin.

Obviously it could replace all other currencies... But I'm assuming some legacy currencies may stay around, and there may always be some alt coins, or people who hold gold, and there are way more dollars across the globe than in just America.  The USD has become the defacto global currency, for better or worse.. So this scenario assumes btc replaces the most widely used dominant currency on the globe, and btc becomes the world reserve currency like the USD is today.  I'd say that's pretty much a total win for btc.

If this guy turned out to be Satoshi after all... imagine the magnitude of irony from the most loved revered figure in Bitcoin also being the most hated dipshit in Bitcoin.  Almost makes me want it to be true.

No exit.  We the holders have revolted against the current system with our dollars. It is in essence an attempted coup.  If a coup fails, it generally doesn't end well for the conspirators.  We may find it's a one way ticket, if not for the Bitcoiners, at least for their traitorous dollars.

Heh, data mining...
"For one, an astonishing number of investors – including this writer – have a hard time getting their minds around key Bitcoin concepts.
These range from how data mining (the process through which Bitcoins are created) is done, to who is behind the various Bitcoin exchanges (this writer could not find a single Canadian operator to speak on record for a recent article), and how good the platform’s encryption is."
