An **excellent alternative to coinmarketcap is  all market capitalizations** have cryptocurrency stats, user comments, and social feeds. 
I've also been using cryptocompare but the information is presented in a more complex manner. 
Keep in mind that another alternative to get live coin prices can sometimes be on the exchange itself (use the high-volume trading sites like bitfinex, bittrex, gdax, binance etc).

Correct, IMO being one of the best alternatives to coinmarketcap.com, coinkapp nicely condenses market capitalizations and supplemental price statistics into average-sized rows. These rows are still far taller than those on coinmarketcap, so it will indeed take you longer to skim through all the coins.

Wow thank you, this explanation is really comprehensive. I have saved it. 
As other replies have mentioned here ... i feel that using a combination of an offline hardware wallet, mobile wallet, and maybe a paper wallet (for the bitcoins i want to store long term) will suit me best. I do want to start buying things with my bitcoin and sending small amounts to friends so that they can test it - hence the mobile wallet will be best for this. 
I appreciate the explanation of the difference between hot and cold storage. This is easier to understand now. Some bitcoin wallets are a strictly one or the other, while most are a mix of both. 
Thanks for that youtube video. I did not know about bitcoin expert Andreas A. He speaks really clearly and is quite the knowledgeable person (i'm currently watching his other talks).
Can anyone briefly explain what is a multi-signature bitcoin wallet?

Cool. Would Electrum be considered an online or offline wallet? Would you say this is "hot" storage?

OK thanks that make sense now. So a hardware USB wallet would be an example of cold storage?
I'm looking into Trezor right now. It has great reviews and seems easy for beginner users like me :)

Hi thanks - yes another reply here also recommended the Ledger Nano and Trezor. I think that I'll go with the latter, as it seems to be the most user-friendly hardware wallet to store my bitcoins.
