One thing we can all agree on is that education is much needed in the cryptocurrency space. Today, there are still many barriers for beginners to learn about and buy their first coin. Ben removes these barriers by providing an all-in-one mobile app where everyone can buy, store, sell, and learn about Bitcoin.
We designed Ben so that beginners feel like a friend is walking them through every step of their journey. You can ask Ben questions like "what is mining" for a quick simple response, or if you want to go more in-depth, you can read the four lessons for an overview of the technology and history.
We are posting in r/bitcoin because if you're anything like us, you've probably experienced lots of people asking you to explain Bitcoin and the blockchain. So save yourself some time and send Ben to all those friends and family who need a little extra nudge in the right direction. 
We'd love to hear your feedback:

Thank you! We also pull prices from several exchanges for every buy or sell order.

I'm so sorry! The minimum Android version we support is 5.1 right now

we spent a couple of months looking for different options until we were able to buy the [Ben.co]( domain name from its previous owner.

Hi u/thumpas! We expect to launch buying and selling in North Carolina within the next few months. Any time we add more states to [the list]( we'll send out an email about it!
