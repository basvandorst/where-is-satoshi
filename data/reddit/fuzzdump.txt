The dead cat's falling back down.

Pray tell, where does it say in my post "six days from now"? I'm looking at it, and it pretty clearly says "one month."
By all means, continue to buy if you're so confident. I'll be back in a month.

I believe this is called the "bull trap" or "dead cat bounce."

You told people to buy after a bubble pop. I don't care what you think you know, that's bad advice, and I called you out on it.


That says it all right there. Clearly you're not as confident as you appear. You're flinging "I told you so" around right as we hit the bull trap, and yet you're not even willing to commit to it long term. Sad.

If you are buying bitcoins right now, during the post-bubble freefall, then you have no idea what you're doing and you deserve every loss you're going to get.
Even if you're a "believer" who's in it for the long haul, buying now (as opposed to in a month when it'll be dirt cheap) is just bad money sense.

Which is why most people in that situation would spend fiat, and hoard their bitcoins. Wanting the item today is rarely worth effectively spending twice the price for it.
This is a problem.

And backed by a government... did you forget that part?

Equating "a month" to "six days" is not a technicality, it's a straw man.
Pretty cocky to be actually *gloating* after [five days of what looks exactly like]( the [bull trap]( I hope you're absolutely certain, because if not, you're going to look ridiculous.
Let's make a deal. If the price doesn't drop below $50 by or before June 1, 2013, I'll come back and admit I'm wrong. If it does, you come back and admit you're wrong. Deal?

There is no way to establish absolute certainty about economics, but it amazes me that there is *still* a lot of denial about the bubble that just popped. People are saying "anything could happen!" Yes, technically anything COULD happen. But if we've learned anything from every bubble ever, what is most likely to happen is that the freefall will continue for a few weeks, bottom out, climb a little and stabilize.
Saying "now is the time to buy" to people who don't know better is despicable.

...what? Did you even read that book? He says 10,000 hours is the key to success. That has nothing to do with becoming a professional. By definition, a professional is somebody with a profession.

Denial.
