i'm not quite sure, but you can't exchange bitcoin for gold. at first you have to exchange it for USD or other currency, then only for gold..and there's one problem: while you send or sell bitcoin it's exchange rate can change dramatically

Wow! I never gave a thought of it..but..i believe it is not going to happen soon, and until it's not world currency there is no reason to worry about it.

advertisements need to have a lot of viewer in order to be potentially profitable for the content creators. The max revenue of an ad would be a few dollars per thousand views, however these rates are generally for video type ads that would be unlikely to be seen on a reddit thread. 
Also people do not solely view a reddit thread because of the original content, they also view a thread because of the conversation occurring in the thread, and this is really not the content creator but the community as a whole.

Wow! Isn't it a big amount of money to give?? If there will be 100 students, then it's -1000$. And I'm sure there will be more.

Good article, but there is one moment "Bitcoin is also great for the small business owner. By using Coinbase, you can accept bitcoin as a payment method for goods you sell online. Unlike other major credit card accepting companies, there is no fee charged to your business up to $1,000,000. Even after you make your first million, the transaction fee is then only 1 percent to cash out bitcoin. " ..There is a small detail: to exchange it to cash, fees depends on the currency. Some of them are relatively high!

perhaps it needs just time and a bit of success! in case of bitcoin goes popular they may change their minds..or just see potential in selling some of production anonymously.
