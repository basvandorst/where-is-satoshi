Chill. If you payed and got a atm confirmation about the transfer your order will be save. A bitcoin transaction needs confirmations from the miners so get valid. A Maximum of 6 confirmations are needed to write your transaction in the blockchain forever. For some wallets three confirmations are enought, some want all six of them. Depending on your transaction fees your order will be written in the blockchain faster. Per confirmation of the network you have to wait about 10 - 30 minutes depenting on your fee.

yes you are right. you can call it "above ground" if you will. but a large amount of bitcoin traffic occurs in darknet sections because of the anonymity. A state cannot ban bitcoin because there always will be guys who can trade it in fiat for you.
