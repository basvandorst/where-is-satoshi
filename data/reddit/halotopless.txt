If posts on reddit can hurt a currency, it's not a valuable currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:08:54
Yes, you can buy fractions. 
Say I buy $100 worth of bitcoin, ..$85 after the FEE of actually buying them in the first place.
oh boy I have a very small fraction of a bitcoin.
if bitcoin literally doubles in price, which could take years, if it happens at all, I'll make $60 after fees/bank transfer.
There's no incentive for anyone to really buy-in if they can't afford to throw out 15-20k on a bitcoin. Not many people can afford that so they won't see a point in investing peanuts on a ship that has already sailed.

where did I talk of an $85 fee? perhaps English isn't your first language
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:16:54
I'm sure that's a very small minority. Most investors just want to make money quickly.

Jabroni..cool word
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:38:51
Exactly. It reached the end. You'll see it go up and down 1 or 2k a few times as it has been doing. It's pitter-pattering until the engine finally seizes.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:18:08
hats off to the people potentially who only lost 30% of their investment?
y'all are so delusional
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:16:13
there are no facts in bitcoin. it's "speculation"
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:45:02
Bitcoin/crypto is all speculation, so there's no stone-cold facts. 
By design, 20k was the highest bitcoin could ever go. Without hype and the possibility of becoming rich, bitcoin would never appeal to the masses. 
A couple weeks ago bitcoin came as close as it could to mass-adoption. It reached it's pinnacle of hype, where everyone thought they still had a chance to make a big profit. That in itself is what caused bitcoin to fail.
Not many people truly cared about the intrinsic value of bitcoin. Not enough to make it a real currency. 
Without people wanting to get rich, you'd likely never have heard about bitcoin. 
The future is very dim, seeing as there are so many issues with the mempool etc.
Bitcoin will never get this kind of attention again. 
There's nothing to recover from. It won't get past 15k again.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:54:23
I have not lost anything. I sold at 16k and have been making good trades all the way down today.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:56:22
This is not the same. Bitcoin got as close to mass-adoption as it possibly could have. There are no more benchmarks or milestones.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:02:18
I realize bitcoin may not have STARTED as a get-rich quick scheme, BUT....
I don't think it could have gotten mass-adoption WITHOUT being that way.
Therefore, if it no longer provides an incentive for the masses of people to make a lot of money, it will cease to grow.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:53:31
Making an educated claim is not the same as making a blind prediction.
I have followed bitcoin closely for 5 years now, I watch the charts constantly. I have a very good feel and understanding for how the market works.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:57:59
Don't have to believe me, I know I'm right though.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:30:30
Crypto was all hype. I called this crash yesterday and everyone flamed me. No crypto had any value, it was just people hoping one of them would turn into the next bitcoin, and bitcoin is essentially a pyramid scheme.

Why hold when you could sell and buy back lower? lmao. this "HODL" shit is so dumb.

Bitcoin may not behave like a stock, but some patterns/trends can apply to anything in life. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:13:29
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:07:29
I think, therefore it's true.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:01:11
Just speculating. ;)
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:07:17
I respect the enthusiasm, but if I was holding right now I think I'd kill myself. I sold at 16,000 and have been watching this thing burn and loving it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:26:21
This is unlike any other "dip". The core of bitcoin failed. It has been exposed as a flawed technology. The value is not there. On the way down you'll see people day-trading so it's going to go up and down a bit, but rest assured it will keep on falling.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:52:13
The price was cheap enough for the average person back then.
What average working person can afford an entire bitcoin at this price?
Bitcoin grows when there's a demand. There's no demand when people can't afford it.
buying .2 of a bitcoin doesn't have a chance for exponential growth so it becomes unappealing to invest.
It was appealing back when the price was under 10k/coin.
Bitcoin will never get to 20k again. That is where it will always hit a wall.
The scam could continue though.
Perhaps it goes back to 5,000 or less again....that's when the train will start all over again, bringing in the new batch of suckers. rinse and repeat.

What's with this childish circle jerk mentality everyone on here has? "Ur not kewl enough for the crypto club" "weak handz" 
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:20:52
Honestly, that's boring.
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:28:46
And as Everyone rebuttals with: if not for traders the price would never change. Exchanges are the reason the price is the way it is. It's also not like everyone was keeping their money on there long-term. The exchange went down an hour after I sent my coins there. It was just an ill twist of fate. Could have never foreseen my luck being that bad. But thank you for the well wishes.

Delusion 
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:37:53
Had my life savings on btc-e in the form of LTC (stupid, I know). But news like this sure makes me glad as hell I didn't have it in fiat. Almost hate being toyed around like this. I tried just accepting the loss but now I'm getting my hopes up. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:12:21
For sure, man. What sucks is it was really out of my control. I'd just gotten back into crypto after getting burned in 2013 when it crashed. My deposit on coinbase went through and I transferred my funds to btc-e to do some trading because I remembered that was the site I used back in 2013. I shit you not the site went down 2 hours later. I get keeping your funds on an exchange is bad, but I couldn't have foreseen something like that happening so quickly. Felt almost surreal. All I can do is hope things get sorted out. Hell at this point I'd be happy to get a quarter of it back. Definitely gonna just hold my coins on a wallet from now on if I get them back. If I don't get them back, I'll sadly just not be involved with crypto anymore.
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:59:42
I feel you, brother. I appreciate the positive sentiments. I feel stuck as well. I want to buy more coins, but after taking such a loss I feel a bit scarred. I am just bitter at the moment and feel like the price is too high for me to buy in. I will be very upset if it skyrockets to 5,000 and I'll also feel sad if it crashes. I'm not sure how to feel right now. I wish you luck as well. I have a good feeling about btc-e surprising us all.
