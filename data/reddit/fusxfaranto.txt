Tell that to the fucking Chinese companies that all stopped accepting bitcoin.  It doesn't matter how much people argue about bitcoin's specific legality in China, if businesses in China are too scared to deal with bitcoin, it doesn't matter how "technically legal" it is.

There's a difference between acting entitled about a volunteer not doing a great job, and acting entitled about a volunteer doing something actively malicious.

I'd definitely say it's much easier to trust software in Linux over Windows, though.  With Windows, pretty much every piece of software has to be procured separately, each having its own installation and updating systems.  With Linux, you can get most software straight from your package manager, which is much easier to trust than random download websites.

Well, primarily because of the fact that bitcoin is awfully unstable, so if it happened to crash you could lose a great deal of money (or all of it, if it died entirely).

Probably because the bitcoin "community" is terrible, full of libertarians at best and anarchists at worst.  Not to mention its main advantage over fiat is buying illegal things and tax evasion...
