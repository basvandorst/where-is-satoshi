While it's doubtful that the TM thing was the main driver of Gox's downfall, it is not a non-issue as shown by it being subsequently exploited to DOS the entire network after Gox brought it to more people's attention.

Ecuador actually uses the US dollar as their currency. So when the US adopts bitcoins as the official currency, it looks like Ecuador is going to be up Shit Creek without a paddle!

You're correct. 
Any economic activity being interpreted from the bitcoins sent stat is *MASSIVELY* overstated.
For the reason you mentioned, but even more so because of change addresses. When you initiate a transaction from an address with 50 btc to pay someone 1 btc, 50 btc will be added to the bitcoins sent stat, because 1 btc will go to the person you are paying and 49 btc will go to a newly created change address that you control. This is done for privacy.
Then consider a combination of these two things(change addresses and transactions between a single person). Imagine a dark market, gambling site, or exchange. This site is holding users' funds in a pooled 10,000 btc address. You request a withdrawal of 10 btc, this is essentially a transaction between you and yourself. The site sends you your 10 btc and the rest to a new change address, congratulations you just added 10,000 btc to the bitcoins sent stat.
It's not a requirement of the protocol to use new change addresses, but it is more or less the default, and even if you are receiving change in the same address you send from, I think the change will still register on the bitcoins sent stat.

Believe you about what? You said there was no DoS attack when clearly there was, and I provided historical evidence showing that in fact there was.
All Mr. Garzik is saying is that the "block chain consensus mechanism and payment system" parts of the software are not *directly* affected by the TM issue existing unexploited, however since it is all a part of the same system if someone chooses to exploit the TM issue then that does have an effect on the whole system(as detailed in the links above), including "block chain consensus mechanism and payment system."

Yes ETFs and 'strong exchanges' should they appear, would be notable developments, but it doesn't do much to change the fact that an investment in bitcoin is highly speculative and it is still far from clear how the value proposition of bitcoin is going to pan out, that is, what are people going to use it for, if anything.

Here is what OP removed.
My name is "Chris" and for the last six months it was my job to come here on reddit, on several other sites such as CNN, MSNBC, CNBC and Bloomberg and to counter your arguments about why Bitcoin is awesome.  
Let me tell you about my back story first. I am going to do this in a way where I will obfuscate some details a bit because I do know what these people are capable of and I frankly don't want to be found because of a stupid mistake.  
I'll safely tell you that I live in one of the "six California regions" and my job took place in one of those areas as well.  
I worked in the user support department at a large startup for nearly three years before the day came when out of no where I decided it was a good idea to go off and create my own startup.  
With my earnings from an IPO I figured I had enough money to make it happen. Long story short, I failed. Miserably.  
A long period of not having any money, my girlfriend leaving me, and everything going to shit soon came to be. After about seven months of this shit I just wasn't sure what to do next. My apparently money grubbing but beautiful girlfriend had left me, I was on the verge of eviction and unsure what to do.  
I wasn't quite ready to pack my bags and head back to the Midwest to live with my parents as many of my similar aged peers had done but I was just about ready to call it quits.  
One day I was literally on the verge of just giving up when an excoworker called me up and said she was no longer working at the startup we were at. She had started a new company and believed I was well suited to join ranks with her.  
Intrigued as to what it was, she simply stated I wouldn't know the details until I came to the office. She gave me the address and I pulled it up on Google Maps to see it was located in a complete and total slum area and the building specifically looked awful.  
I debated what the hell kind of seedy company was she operating. It had to be porn. It just had to be porn. Seedy building, shady hood, not telling me anything about it, she was beautiful.  
Shit, perhaps I had a chance to get paid to have sex. Maybe I would be fortunate and get to have sex with her. I'll bite.  
Arriving at the address I found the building completely nondescript and I was completely unsure if I was in the correct place. Even still I went inside.  
A sign for the name of the business appeared on the door but it didn't matter. I would later learn the name of the company would be changing every two weeks. Whoever actually owned the building didn't seem to care that the company on the lease was always changing names. I now suspect that is because they were the client.  
An older man met me at the door and said, we pay people to go online to various websites and help us influence the opinions of others. Your job would be to help our clients have an impact on the lie that is digital currencies.
What the hell was this?  
I wasn't really aware what Bitcoin was when I started. I mean, I knew some of the people at the startup I was at had been looking at it at one point. I asked where Vanessa was and he told me she was working in another office in another state to setup a similar outpost of sorts.  
During the interview I was asked how I felt about a wide range of technologies and how many friends and family members i had. Near the end they stated that what I was doing would require complete and total secrecy and that I couldn't tell anyone, not even my family or significant other (didn't have one at the time) and that a cover story would be provided to me.  
Now I was very curious as to what the fuck I would be doing so I asked. My interviewer simply stated that I would be helping to counter erroneous arguments on the Internet. That our clients would be paying for us to help point out obvious flaws in the oppositions view points.  
I'm not a moral person and to be honest when I started I just didn't give a damn. So, this didn't bug me all that much.  
The next day I came in for my first day and sat down.  
My “trainer" sat me down with two three ringed binders. He said to read and learn as much as I could because in two hours I would be tested by being thrown in to real life conversations.  
Inside the binders I found all sorts of arguments and counters to be used on various sites against Bitcoin.
Two hours came and passed and I was completely overwhelmed as I had no idea Bitcoin was such a vast thing. It was okay though, I would have the binders to help me.  
A reddit account was provided to me. It was fairly fresh minus a voting history. I was told these accounts were created in bulk, sometimes in the thousands and then unleashed upon the Bitcoin reddit at random to prevent them from being caught as shills.  
A Google Chrome extension was installed and each system was connected in a way to obfuscate the IP address. I would later come to learn it was done via various VPN services. Each system would attempt to get a different IP from each other and if more than three matched in the room it would throw it out and try for another. Sadly, I am not aware of the technical details as they kept that fairly hidden from us.  
The Chrome extension would tell us where to go. It didn't contain a direct link as apparently reddit will counter with shadow bans for that sort of behavior. It would simply tell us the links to follow to get where we needed to be. Basically it would say something like Reddit &gt; Bitcoin &gt; New &gt; Thread Title and a check box once we had completed our task.  
It was simple, go in, leave a comment then hit the check mark. A prompt came up asking for us to paste our comment and the metadata around it and click OK. Once we did that another assignment came in.  
I asked where the assignments came from and my trainer simply stated that another office somewhere else was doing the same thing but they were tasked with gathering stories. I asked him if the people knew what they were doing and he said he wasn't sure but he imagined they weren't told it was for us to come in and counter these clearly false arguments for Bitcoin.  
Sometimes our assignment would be very simple. A location would come in with a down arrow. It was our simple job to downvote the piece as quickly as possible. I remembered one of the headlines one night and looked it up when I got home. Sure as shit it was downvoted to oblivion.  
It had appeared if something was downvoted fast enough it often was ignored and these guys were the masters of this. Sometimes it would have a crossbone symbol. That meant we needed to report the story.  
This was happening 24/7! I am guessing that even this post will be downvoted to oblivion or reported immediately. We will see if it even sees the light of day. I will certainly be watching and am fully expecting it to be downvoted almost immediately to be honest with you.  
I've been thinking about how that worked. My hypothetical is that they tell people they are gathering content for a content farm or something. One thing I quickly learned was that everything was very compartmentalized and discussion amongst team members wasn't allowed.  
That said one night after work I went out with a coworker who was kind of attractive. I asked her what she was working on and she simply stated something about Israel. Apparently not everyone was working on the same things. I pressed her further but she was scared of not having a job anymore and that I might be testing her so she wouldn't go further. Granted, we did not go out again.  
I am here to answer you questions for a limited time only. So ask me anything.

Is there much evidence of that though? These companies are operating on VC money chasing returns from a perceived growth market. A perceived growth market that very well could have been primarily the result of Willy bot.
So until these companies are generating enough revenue to be self-sustaining and no longer operating on investment cash reserves, or appear on track to be doing so, there's not much evidence that "people even want a third party service to handle the portion of their money that was meant to be free of third parties."

Right they were identifying transactions using of all things... 'transaction id.'
But even though the transaction id attribute is malleable, it wouldn't have mattered unless someone chose to exploit it. And that's just what happened, someone chose to exploit it. So the businesses weren't effectively *DOS*ing themselves because there wouldn't have been an issue had someone not chosen to exploit this protocol bug/'quirk.'

It is a far riskier investment today.
Quoteth wikipedia, "Risk is the potential of losing something of value, weighed against the potential to gain something of value."
The ratio of loss to potential reward at $2 is impossible[edit: or not] to be matched today.
A bitcoin bought at $2 and sold today at $512 is a power of 9 return[edit: 2^9 return], nine doublings.
-----------edit: wild misguided flight of fancy----------  
  
To get a power of 9 return on a bitcoin bought today at $512, you would have to sell at...
2 septillion 417 sextillion 851 quintillion 639 quadrillion 229 trillion 258 billion 349 million 412 thousand 352 dollars.
$2,417,851,639,229,258,349,412,352.00  
  
Edit: To get the same return as you would have from buying at $2 and selling at $512, when buying at $512 you would have to sell at $131,072. Does that have less potential of happening than $2 to $512? What do you think?[serious]
Edit: oops, got a little mixed up. I should have known that seemed a *little* high.  Thanks guys.

The risk associated with bitcoin from an investment perspective is not, "Oh no, if I'm associated with this, the DEA might bust down my door!" but rather, since the value of bitcoin is still more or less entirely speculative, an investor could see a significant negative return on investment.

I like how it is a show about networks, but you don't want to involve 'the networks.'  Interesting how in the past, the term 'network' was often used for the hub and spoke broadcast type network, but nowadays the more relevant networks are a far more decentralized type.(ghash withstanding, which actually gives me an idea for your question)
The dramatic elements could involve some sort of crisis facing the decentralized system. A crisis that a viewer unfamiliar with the workings of decentralized systems would perceive to be more or less insurmountable.  Then the crisis would be resolved in a way so as to highlight the unique properties of decentralized systems.

Well, this is fake.
When people are lying, they'll often times add in lots of extraneous details, such as  


I debated what the hell kind of seedy company was she operating. It had to be porn. It just had to be porn. Seedy building, shady hood, not telling me anything about it, she was beautiful.  
Lots more examples in there.  
Then there's this --
"I had no idea Bitcoin was such a vast thing."  
 Well, bitcoin is not that vast, if you do the preliminary reading and check out this subreddit a few times a week you'll have a pretty good handle on it. But saying "I had no idea Bitcoin was such a vast thing," sure sounds a lot like something that somebody who would make a fake post like this would say.
OP, if you want to provide just the slightest evidence of what you're saying is in any way remotely true why not point to some evidence, that on the basis of your claims, should be easy to come by. Have any links to the copy pasta "shill" posts on the sites you mentioned? Have any links to any relevant, genuinely newsworthy post on this subreddit that were "Sure as shit downvoted to oblivion" by your little downvote brigade in the office building with the bi-monthly name change in the seedy part of town?

But would that have been safer? If I'd just said California, people might just assume San Fran or LA, but if I said in one the 'six regions' they might think Eureka or something, I could be anywhere, anywhere in *one* of the six regions!*
 
So I thought 'six regions' would be safer, and I always try to be safe, except when I'm going to seedy parts of town hoping to bang my ex-coworkers.

If people are using Circle or whatever other service that promises to make it so easy your cat could do it, then they aren't really using bitcoin, they are using bitcoin by proxy. And when you use bitcoin by proxy, that pretty much negates all the selling points of bitcoin[1], so what exactly is going to make people want to use bitcoin by proxy?
Why can't those of us who want to use bitcoin for what it is be happy with it working well enough? 
...oh yeah, because we all want to be billionaires!
Bitcoin also provides an intriguing alternative to present day monetary policy, but there are political aspects to that as well, not just technological.
[1] It's thought that widespread use of bitcoin, whether by proxy or not, would result in a percent or two less in costs, but that is still conjecture. And it is unlikely those savings would make it to the bitcoin paying purchaser. Likely they would just be saved by the merchant, or be the profit for bitpay, coinbase, or some other centralized processor of a decentralized payment processing system.

Interesting theory, though accepting bitcoin for the service might be helpful for that, rather suspicious however.
I was considering if Mark K was the sole culprit in the missing coins, whether he was clever enough to setup a new business, as if to say, "Who me? Millions of ill-gotten funds? I'm just out here entrepreneurin' trying to make ends meet."
