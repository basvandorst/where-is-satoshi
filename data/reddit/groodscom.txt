You inspired me to get mine going again! I was concerned that I was nearing my bandwidth cap from my ISP so I shut it off after about a month (I was over 90% capacity). Now I realize that there are lots of things you can do to minimize your bandwidth consumption.

The only advice I’ve ever given was to never sell everything. Keep some (maybe 50%) just in case what you think is going to happen doesn’t. This was based on some of my previous experience of trading stocks.
I had a friend who bought 10 He ended up selling 5 He wishes he hadn’t now, but imagine how bad he’d have felt had he sold it all (of course a 2x gain is still awesome no matter what).

So if both the sender and receiver are using the P2SH SegWit addresses (not bech32), is there still an additional 10% overhead, or is there only additional overhead when one party is non-segwit?

I am going to. It’s only 15% if you held more than a year so it’s not really that bad. Plus I would rather not risk being audited since coinbase will be sending out 1099Ks.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:52:45
Thank you for responding. I really am not understanding how p2sh is saving on transaction fees though. With 10% more overhead, it’s increasing fees. Where does the savings come in? Maybe there is some complex thing I’m missing?

They are all the same address so they should always have the same value according to the Blockchain.
As far as security goes, I would try to keep larger amounts in offline storage and everyday spending amounts on a phone for example. Having just one wallet on so many devices gives more opportunities for attack.

On the exchange you don’t have a personal wallet. Instead, exchanges like coinbase keep a record of your balance and manage their own wallets. That’s why many people (especially those here) like to keep their coins in a hardware or other personal wallet.

I remember when I found out about bitcoin in 2011 there was an exchange called Mt. Gox. I was curious about buying a little bitcoin (I was just starting to invest in the stock market). The only problem was that it was in Japan, which meant I had to set up a Dwolla account at the time. I started going through the process but it felt a little fishy to me, linking my bank account and doing all the verification stuff. If it was a little easier like in this video, I might have bought maybe $100 *just to see* what would happen if I "set it and forgot it." It was around $17 per BTC at that time though so not that much bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:23:21

I accidentally sold 2BTC last night. I know that’s insane, right? I’ve been hodling for years and I was just curious what the fee would be for a market trade, expecting I would see some sort of summary or confirmation screen before my order was committed. After realizing my mistake I acted quickly and put in a limit order for $14.9k. Those 1-2 minutes of stress was not worth the ~$130 before capital gains.

People don’t realize how difficult it was to buy bitcoin back then. I started the process but stopped after I set up my dwolla account. The whole thing seemed sketchy. It was actually easier to mine it. I used to mine 2 bitcoins per week but it was worth about $13 back then. I didn’t do that long though as I needed my GPU for gaming.
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:59:45
I remember that bear run. I bought at $800, $600, $500 and around $300 if I remember right. At the end of 2014 I had $10,000 to invest and I sort of joked with my wife about investing it all in bitcoin. I think it was around $200. I did not invest the $10k, but I can’t complain about the profits I took at $19k.

I remember a guy several years ago talking about bitcoin as an investment. I think it was on a podcast or news show. He said he invested 10% of his net worth into bitcoin. The next episode the host was explaining about how that guy either couldn’t talk about bitcoin anymore because he was invested in it or he had to sell his bitcoin and would be able to continue to cover it. I hope he hedl and just stopped covering it.
Also, what happens when your bitcoin investment goes over 10% of your net worth? ��

Well said. I really wonder how much of an effect the halving will have. If we’re trading now based on that speculation, then it’s kind of taking that decreased supply into effect isn’t it?

I might have given them more than .0001 BTC but I don’t know how many people took you up on the bitcoin.

A dangerous dance we are doing. The move from the 3000s to 4000s was unexplained and now the momentum just keeps building. I’ve been watching trade volumes a lot and at the beginning of the year on coinbase pro, it was less than 3000 BTC. Now, we’re near 40,000 BTC. At the peak of 2019 it was 100,000 BTC.

I mean, in that shitstorm scenario I don't even think gold would be the most valuable currency (since most people don't own physical gold). Sad to say but bullets will probably be the more useful in a that world. Call me a pessimist but I'm not sure if humanity could sustain itself in anything other than what we recognize as our current societal norms, especially if it was a catastrophic failure such as our electrical grid being fried by a solar flare. It would be mass chaos and billions would die.

Except too many people will cash out long before that, causing another correction. People get to a point where they look at their value and take profits. I think the pattern will continue for some years to come. Unfortunately, I don’t think this is healthy for adoption. Even if it’s a somewhat regular pattern over several years, it still seems unstable to most people.
Edit: I did see that it’s “long-term,” but that’s pretty vague. 10 years? 20 years? I would agree, but only after several ups-and-downs.
