Nice SJW story. The Russians created corruption in Washington and they lost the Pentagon money too.

Typical brainwashing by the liberal Zionist media.
@_date: 2017-07-18 16:34:01
Okay. It's a fairytale.
@_date: 2017-07-17 06:41:51
Exactly 
@_date: 2017-07-18 16:34:39
The Russians didn't hack anything. That story is a WW3 starter.

Will do. It's taking forever for it to download the block chain so I do it intermittently so I can use the net. It slows everything down. Thanks 
@_date: 2017-06-17 01:19:48
That's fine. I have the space on the SSD. Can I close the main one running?
@_date: 2017-06-17 01:19:07
Already sent my bitcoin to Bitcoin core wallet 
@_date: 2017-06-17 01:07:34
It's downloading though.
@_date: 2017-06-17 01:26:58
Thank you for your responses.
@_date: 2017-06-17 01:04:10
True. Bitcoin core and the block chain have taken over my computer. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 01:26:34
Thanks. I closed it and now I'm running it on a hard drive.
@_date: 2017-06-17 01:16:23
Okay, I downloaded it on my SSD. Can I close the one that's been running?
@_date: 2017-06-17 14:13:51
I'm a complete noob. Where I install -noconnect option?
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:30:01
Hope not

Thanks

Is that a command line function? I'm a noob. I was just following direction from the weusecoins site.
@_date: 2017-06-17 01:03:26
Okay, but I am just getting it downloaded For the first time and it's being the block chain has my storage toast. It's been almost 24 hours at least.
@_date: 2017-06-17 00:50:14
Both. I have had to delete everything and it's slowed down the whole machine. I got tired of the Coinbase outages.
@_date: 2017-06-17 01:20:15
Wow!! ����
@_date: 2017-06-17 01:21:21
Will do something faster when I clear this up.
@_date: 2017-06-17 01:49:37
It's on the separate disk, but it's still running down the storage?
@_date: 2017-06-17 01:16:07
Okay, I downloaded it on my SSD. Can I close the one that's been running?
