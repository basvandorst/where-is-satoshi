Before each node was equal to one miner.
@_date: 2017-03-30 01:52:43
1 CPU that actually mines. So currently miners have millions of CPU votes. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 04:41:55
There won't be 95% consensus amongst miners to activate segwit for sure. So there must be other way to force what non-miner wants. Miners will adapt or perish.

Why do you mean that they lobbied for the Ethereum Heist? DAO hack? How did they lobby for it?

Do you realize that its equally easy to start non-UASF node as it is easy to start UASF node. Do you really expect that opponents of UASF will not be starting BU or Classic nodes in response to new UASF nodes?
@_date: 2017-04-04 04:16:41
First time I hear BU is dead. What's your source? Because its not hashrate, as BU's hash rate is much higher then that for SW.

Its the record of spam transactions. Someone must be burning a lot of money for this spam attack.

If you want to use non-centralized and third parties, you can just banks to run your contracts.  
@_date: 2017-05-31 01:14:30
No, because rsk is [federated sidechain]( Requires trusted parties, thus its not trust-less and decentralized.  
@_date: 2017-05-31 01:37:10
What it has to do with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-19 07:22:47
I will do exactly opposite.
@_date: 2017-05-31 01:50:35
RSK is coming to bitcoin and it will eliminate any need for ETH. RSK at the moment requires trusted setup, not perfect, but then it not depended on a single person - Vitalik's mood of the day.  
What dapps? All of them are ICO get-rich-quick scams by its developers, unless Vitalik will start hardforking blockchain to take his funds back, as he did with DAO.
@_date: 2017-05-19 08:30:46
Thank you for the list. I will tweet them with recommendation of a different scaling solution.  
@_date: 2017-05-19 08:33:55
Even better for the spammers. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 23:18:59
They have polish speaking moderators though.

You can find his talks on [youtube](

They will not interact. ETH is in a pump now. Once the pump finishes, many people will forget about ETH, as it has no use.
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:06:36
This is different version of the segwit, not the one orgianly designed. This new version, made outside Bitcoin Core, seem likely to preserve ASICBOOST. Orginal Core version would make ASICBOOST useless.
@_date: 2017-05-31 01:40:38
For that to happen you will have to wait unknown amount of time. For now it is as I wrote it is. If you want to write about some possible future events you can write endless essays about it.
@_date: 2017-05-31 01:21:55
Yep, but you don't need explicit vitalik permission to use ethereum. For federated sidechain everyone has to go through the trusted parties to move btc in and out sidechains. And if you still don't like proof of vitalik concept, you can always go to etc.

Good luck with your paypal and banks.
@_date: 2017-06-07 06:17:44
So? 
@_date: 2017-06-07 01:25:20
The agreement also brings 2MB blocks. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:59:12
uasf is freedom from miners and their greed.
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:30:16
I'm selling and buying back more for cheaper. That's how trading works. Dumping on new users.
@_date: 2017-06-15 00:01:37
Did you buy at higher price and now want to minimize your losses by hoping that the price will not go further down?  
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:56:54
They are indicating that all current proposed solutions are rubbish. So its better to stick with what has been working for last eight years, than to support sub-par scaling solutions.
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:55:01
I shouldn't be used for spam transactions. Use it when you have some serious money to transfer.
@_date: 2017-06-16 02:45:18
I will go down as traders and new comers confidence is shaken with the constant news about forks and hostile takeover by miners. People will just wait and see what is going to happen in upcoming weeks. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 01:23:17
Why so nervous? SW + 2MB blocks are coming with NY agreement.
