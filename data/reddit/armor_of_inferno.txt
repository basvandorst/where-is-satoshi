Can you explain what asicboost is? I know what an asic is, but this is the first time I've heard the term asicboost.

Do you happen to have link to that whitepaper?

I didn't downvote you. You know reddit has auto-comment scoring, right? 
I think your advice is actually very sound. The complexities of cryptocurrency mean that it requires a lot of focus just to stay current. There are certainly easier investments out there. I compare cryptocurrency right now to the Klondike Gold Rush. People set out to make their fortunes in a sea of wild claims. There is money to be made, but most of it is by shady people making money off of fortune hunters. Paycoin is a prime example of that.

This is great advice. 
Right now, to me,  it seems foolish to invest in any mining.  There are plenty of people willing to participate in the mining equipment arms race, and they have coin to sell as they struggle for profitability.

I can't wait to see what you've still got left.  This is the new r/whatsinthisthing until we know.  We're counting on you to update us, OP.  Good luck, bro!

I've always wondered how long. I imagine that it might be hard to predict given hashrates, but do we know when the last coin will be mined?
Also, what happens to verification once that last coin is mined?

Not FUD.  Just a noob, apparently.  See my edit where I added exact figures.  And as others have suggested, if I can send via GDAX for free, I'll definitely start using it instead of Coinbase.

Ok, so was it Coinbase that was behind the $2.55 fee?  Is there any way I can know the breakdown is - what portion is Coinbase tacking on BS fees and what is the *actual* network fee?
EDIT: Corrected fee cost in USD.

I got my answer so I've deleted my post.
I don't know everything about Bitcoin, but I know that you're making it pretty damn hard to learn.

I had to look up what the mempool was after reading your comment.  For any other novices, the mempool is "The aggregate size of transactions waiting to be confirmed."
So basically you're saying that since transaction volumes are low, network fees are low, too?  I assume that 1sat/b means 1 satoshi per byte taken in the mempool?

I will definitely start using GDAX.  As I understand it, they're owned by Coinbase, right?  Can I keep my autobuy through Coinbase and just send it through GDAX?
@_date: 2018-02-09 02:38:48
**EDIT 2**: I got my answer and since some people mistakenly thought this was a FUD post, I'm going to delete it now.  
TL;DR: Coinbase is for chumps and was responsible for that fee, so use GDAX instead.  is awesome and shared [this playlist on how to use GDAX](

That's really great info!
Are fees lower now because the community solved a technology problem, or because of the market correction?
@_date: 2018-02-09 02:27:27
Thank you!  This is tremendously helpful, especially the video playlist.

If you like science fiction, you may enjoy reading a book called We Are Legion (We Are Bob), by Dennis Taylor. It is about a guy who gets turned into an AI and launched into space as a von-Neumann probe.

Does anyone do an analysis when Bitcoin prices have sharp rises or falls? I'd love to know what is behind these trends. 
I've been doing maintenance buys for a while now - just buying some BTC every time I get paid. It makes me wonder if I should instead be reading some market news and waiting for moments like this to buy.
