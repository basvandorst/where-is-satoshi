If this results in demand falling, then it will mean that the price will fall.  This will then be a buying opportunity for those interested in converting more of their assets into BTC.  Thanks Mt. Gox indeed.
Now I get more BTC for my dinero just because the IT plebs at Mt. Gox can't handle transactions properly.  Oh well, more BTC for me.

Thanks for the tip.  Here's some more:
I am working on a theory of money that takes into account Bitcoin, fiat currencies, fiduciary currencies, and commodity currencies.  Here goes:
Menger's Regression Theorem, explicitly talking about the origin or money, is relevant only for the *first* currency that eventually becomes widely accepted.  Before the usage of anything in indirect exchange (i.e. as a currency), everything was used in consumption or direct exchange (aka barter); the intrinsic value or industrial value of the things were the reason to accept them in trade at all.
**Barter to Currency:**
Certain good(s) gained acceptance in barter until people began explicitly asking for that/those good(s) rather than the things they actually wanted to consume; they recognised that it would be easier to get what they actually wanted if they accepted a narrower set of goods right now.  The first currency would then be a commodity currency; considering the nature of pre-history, I cannot in good faith claim what the first currency actually was.  It depends on the state of the economy at the time.
For largely chemical reasons, gold and silver gained ground over other currencies until at least gold was recognised throughout the developed world at the time.  The wide acceptance of gold as a currency automatically made it into money.
**Commodity to Paper:**
When printing was cheap enough, people could afford to print promissory notes for the gold, thus fiduciary media was created; the receipts were traded in the place of the heavy gold coins and ingots and the holders of the gold promised to repay in gold to the holder of the fiduciary media.  The paper fiduciary media supplanted the gold in many places until the fiduciary media became the money; the gold-backig of the paper notes was merely a limitation on the supply of the paper money.  One had to trust that the issuer of the paper notes would not lie about how much gold he actually had.
**Trust to Fiat:**
For various political reasons, governments got involved in the fiduciary media game and eventually claimed ever-increasing control of banks, the traditional issuers of fiduciary media, until the banks were removed completely as issuers of any currency.  Money had then become totally run by the State.  As late as 1970s, governments decoupled their fiduciary media completely from gold; paper currency became fiat currency.
Thus, for at least the last forty years, fiat currency is the normal form of money around the world.  Further, money is limited to largely national borders, because of legal tender.  (I am not sure when legal tender became a thing, but it largely involves the paying of taxes and settling of debts in the government-issued currency.)
**Along came Satoshi:**
Since the first commodity was accepted in indirect exchange, the concept of currency has thrived.  Bitcoin most definitely is a currency, because people use it in indirect exchange; whether it has any industrial/intrinsic value was as irrelevant to its acceptance as a currency as fiduciary media's.  What mattered is that one can get the new currency and that it could be used as such in exchange.  Perhaps people will one day find a use for bitcoins (the currency not the technology) for something other than trade.  When that day comes, the ever-increase in altcoins will have an industrial value (I cautiously kid).
Whether Bitcoin becomes a money will be an historical concern; I can only guess as to whether Bitcoin will supplant any government-issued fiat currencies as money in any country.  Very seriously, that is the single greatest challenge for the "true supporters" of Bitcoin: if it becomes a nationally or the globally-accepted currency then Bitcoin will have achieved the level of acceptance once held by gold; even US dollars are not as widely accepted as gold once was.
There is a lot of history in the above, because I find it relevant to the issue of Bitcoin becoming a money.  Further, I am still working on the theory, so any input is appreciated.

One must take into account variations in behavior due to time preference.  While you do claim there to be a tendency for short-term profit to trump long term gain, I believe this is an incorrect claim.  Very simply, for one to spend money on mining hardware demonstrates a lower time preference than those who would use the same money for sooner consumption (e.g. blackjack and hookers).  That much mining hardware for BTC consists of ASIC miner demonstrates the low time preference of those miners; they would rather give up money (possibly in the tens of thousands of USD/EUR) in the short-term for the chance at getting Bitcoin in the future.  Assuming that to be true, then the very actions of those that buy and use ASIC miners proves that, for them, the longer-term gains trump the short-term profit.  Miners are somewhat important to a bit of Bitcoin's infrastructure.
It is the pool administrators who throw a wrench in this affair, because they can have massive control while expending substantially less resources to the amount of resources they can partially control; their time preferences could be very different from the miners, if they have not bought into the mining business similar to miners.  While pool-admins can easily participate in their own pools, they are clearly paid for operating the pool for the miners, thus, depending on those fees, the admins may gain enough in fees to not bother actually mining; perhaps the maintenance of a pool and mining hardware would take up too much time, but only one would be not too taxing.  Thus, it is more possible, though not necessary, that the pool-admins could meet the adage that short-term profits trump long-term gains.

Anytime I have seen an austrian (as in the austrian school of economics) speak of intrinsic value, they typically are refering to the uses of the thing that must come before a material can become a currency; this comes from Menger's theory on the origin of money (aka Regression Theorem).  Menger was a Marginalist, which meant that he argued for the validity of the Subjective Theory of Value; it was one of most important focuses in his writings.
Terminologically, "intrinsic value" is terrible, because it leads people to think one is speaking about human preferences.  However, outside the context of the origin of money and barter it has no relevance to anything.  It might have been an error in translation that was never corrected; I can't read German, so I can only guess.  Industrial value was a synonym for intrinsic value, which is a tinsy-bit better.
Note FWIW: Money and currency are distinct in Austrian economics; a money is simply the most commonly used currency.

There is a scene from some movie that many people consider motivational.  It is a scene in some sort of mortgage business; it is raining outside.  The line that is repeated by the guy from corporate is, "A-B-C: Always Be Closing".  He is forceful and makes it known that if you are not Always Closing deals with customers, then you should leave; you are here because you are effective at your job, not to drink coffee.  Coffee is for Closers.
I propose that one should "Always Be Buying (Bitcoin)" = ABB(B).  It does not matter the amount; pick an affordable amount in the government-enforced currency (i.e. legal tender) that you normally use; buy that much worth of Bitcoin at a regular interval, perhaps monthly.  This is the First Rule of ABB(B).
The Second Rule of ABB(B) is that one should never transfer BTC out of one's control for legal tender; only spend BTC on goods and services.  It may be acceptable to trade BTC for an altcoin, but please keep it to the big boys like Litecoin and Namecoin (assuming their security issues have been dealt with).
Bitcoin is for Buyers.

It is always possible to use fake money.  If by fake money you mean counterfeiting, then you are stating the obvious.
The reason that certain metals are considered good for the material of a currency is due to two things:
 * Gold/silver are goods, thus their value is based on the subjective valuations of those buying and selling the gold/silver.  Supply and demand is another way of saying subjective valuations.
 * Gold/silver have numerous characteristics that make them useful for currency.  For instance, gold does not corrode or degrade as most other materials do.

As far as I can tell, Hocnet isn't meant to replace the Internet current infrastructure.  Instead, it looks like it meant to augment access in the short-term.
I would say that the paper focuses too much on the usage of wireless itself, especially considering the fact the proposed protocol is merely a combination of mesh-routing and the price mechanism.  Using wi-fi is merely one method; one could use wires or even optical connections.  I bet that end-users will nevertheless prefer wi-fi.

Most meshnet designs do not have very much motivation, thus little broad appeal.  The point of including the price mechanism is to encourage those with spare bandwidth to set up Hocnet routers to sell that unused bandwidth.

[Their solution]( is violence based.  This is antithetical to the very concept of the market, a process of voluntary exchange.  Instead of using the market process, this website claims that the solution is to use the government to fix this problem that Facebook is causing.  However, this problem is private: if you do not use Facebook, then you will never see anything about Facebook Credits.
The goal, getting Facebook to allow various currencies on its website, is totally incompatible with the means, to use the aggression of government.  I am steadfastly opposed to this, the privatized consequences be damned.  Only users of Facebook will be affected, thus it is a private bad, so to speak.
Facebook will suffer losses in the long-run for this move, regardless of how the government reacts.  However, government activity against Facebook will only make it worse, because it will basically mean that the government runs Facebook in big issues, but Facebook gets to run the day-to-day issues.
Fuck. That. Shit. Sideways.

From what I know, the materials of US coins are basically determined to maintain the traditional visual looks of the coins and to keep up with the supply of dollar bills.
Pennies were originally copper in America and England, thus the US mints have attempted to find combinations of materials that make modern US pennies look like copper.  However, US pennies are not made of copper, because the copper is too expensive.  In fact, even though the US mint is using metals that are cheaper than copper, pennies nevertheless cost 2 cents to manufacture.
The US mints are not interested in minting value-stable coins that can buy the same amount of goods over time.  Rather, they seek to cheapen the coins over time, to maintain the supply of the coins relative to the supply of dollar bills.

Not saying your wrong on this, but I seem to recall that ASIC cards are expensive as frell. I wonder if widespread Bitcion acceptance would lead people to buy hardware similar to ASIC and FPGA cards, which would encourage engineering companies to develop even faster hardware.

Bitcoin may never be and should not be the only currency of its kind around.  Why shouldn't a second currency be started with exactly the same methods as Bitcoins, but you change a few things such that this new (and so far non-existent) currency operates along side but separately from Bitcoin.

I can see why gold bugs would call Bitcoin worthlessness.  I think this is a newly discovered (by me :P)  form of objective valuation(my term, I think).  The labor theory of value said that everything has a definite value based solely or primarily on the labor that was put into the product or service.  Similarly, gold bugs seem to hold a kind of gold theory of value for all products and services.  Labor theory of value and gold theory of value are therefore two forms of objective valuation. Since gold and labor have almost always been valuable, this is largely an academic critique, but it shows objective valuation to be somewhat primitivistic when a radically different currency comes around.
I prefer to think of value in a subjective way, because it allows for Bitcoin and even trash to have value.  Also, this subjective theory of value means that my preferences are just as valid for determining the value of something as any other human.  Bitcoin is valuable only because each user and miner subjectively decides it is valuable.
P.S. I mean no disrespect to those who hold gold or labor to be the best standard of value, when I use the phrase "somewhat primitivistic."  Its just that I don't want to into the history of theologians and politicians trying to fix prices when merchants wanted the prices to change freely.

People (typically) aren't greedy; people (typically) want to be assured that their efforts will not be scattered in the wind due to, for instance, a fiat currency collapsing.
I nonethless agree with you that faster adoption of Bitcion is based on value and how many people are adopting Bitcoin.  Of course it works the same way in reverse, but I am trying to be optimistic.

Bitcoin shows how a materially insignificant ones and zeros on a computer can be valuable.  Bitcoin is an exercise in embracing the concept that all value humans place in products, services and currencies is subjective value, as opposed to objective valuation in the form of labor or gold and silver.

The solution to DDoS attacks on 50% or greater of the Bitcion network would be to add more mining pools. If someone is going to take down 50% of mining, then there will be a market incentive for people to dust off their old rigs and/or buy new rigs to mine.
If potential Bitcion miners are well informed about DDoS attacks on mining pools, they will be able to choose the best time to enter the Bitcion mining market, as I call it.
EDIT: I wonder where the DDoS attacks are coming from. Could Bitcoin miners be trying to forcibly push major pools out?  Could a government(s) be trying to take down Bitcoin?

Aphelion ratios of Mars and the Moon (using Earth's aphelion) =~ 1.638 (249,209,300 km / 152,098,232 km), Mars might represent $1638, when the Moon = $1000.  That's far to boring, so let's pick different numbers to try and get a better result.
If we divide the aphelion of the Moon's orbit around Earth by Mars orbit, we get ~ $685 (249,209,300 km / 363,295 km).  That would be a nice price, because it would mean that I would be able to afford more BTC, though it would mean that there would be a monotonic decrease in the USD value of BTC as Bitcoin gets farther from the Sun.  Therefore...
I propose that we try to get BTC to Venus after getting to Mars, so that I can buy in before the price shoots towards infinity as it approaches the Sun (division by zero and all that fun).  [To_The_Sun_Guy]( is accidentally prescient in this regard.
