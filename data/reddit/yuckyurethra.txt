Isn't that what Bitshares is doing with BitUSD?

Bitcoin is still tiny compared to most largeish American companies.

The same thing happened to me once. It was annoying because they had a laptop for ringing up payments and printing receipts, but a tablet dedicated to bitcoin payments. They could have just ran a wallet from the laptop, but instead they busted out their dusty bitcoin tablet which was dead. Luckily it was a market center and not a restaurant, so I just walked around and shopped for 20 minutes while it charged, then went back and paid. An all-in-one solution for merchants would be best.

Is there a chart that shows how closely BitUSD has been able to stay at exactly $1.00?

You don't make any money from the casino?
