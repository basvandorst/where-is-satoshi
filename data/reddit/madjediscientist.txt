You just nailed the next big drop. Government regulation. Cryptos will be forced to evolve and only the strong will survive. Like the one coin thats being used by big banks... And the best one for d-apps.

Keep trading balances on exchanges. Like a checking account. Get a real wallet for your savings account.

Core and Cash are existing in beautiful harmony. Lots of money to be made in both coins. Core is better to HODL, Cash is better for transactions. 
Diversification is key people. Invest wisely. Dont limit your gains by being stubborn.
