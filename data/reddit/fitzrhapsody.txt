I feel like at this point, to most people, that's just like saying "tried air for the first time; was better than methane" lol

This quote, I think, can be argued against pretty easily.
Just prior to this quote, a Business Insider writer is quoted as saying "Gold has real value because it’s shiny and can be used for jewelry."
That was probably a "good enough" reason for a resource to be perceived as valuable in ancient times, when kings and queens ruled and showed off their wealth using gold and other precious stones.
But it's 2017, and the name of the game is globalization. He who is global runs the world. McDonald's, Starbucks, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook... THESE are the companies with more power than perhaps many governments themselves. And to them, the value of a medium of exchange is far greater than the value of a precious stone or metal. As globalization and international trade continue to dominate government policy around the world, an asset's use as a medium of exchange actually gives it greater value than ever before. 
Even if that wasn't historically the case, I feel it's definitely the state of affairs today, and that is why cryptocurrencies do have an intrinsic value.

I completely agree! Global companies value this fluidity more than they value something like the "gold standard."
The author brings up a good point in that an asset's use as a medium of exchange has never *historically* given it intrinsic value, but in 2017, I think it most definitely does.
