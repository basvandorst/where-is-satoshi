I hope you don't have luck with that, in my opinion you are now trying to scam Coinbase: You paid for the bitcoins and they have sent it to the bitcoin address you gave them. Now you want to get your money back, but they already sent the coins.
As said before, please don't blame other people or businesses for the fact that you made a mistake and for the fact that you did not informed yourself the product (bitcoin) before you bought it.

Sorry, but how could it be that there is no fee, but it's always 2%-8% more expensive than Cryptsy? (I do keep the order dept in mind with the calculation).
This could be explained if they don't use Cryptsy, but they say they use multuple exchanges to get the best price.
And if there was really no fee, what is the business model? 
@_date: 2015-06-17 09:06:24
I see many typos on your website, the most noticeable is in your footer, you typed the name of your service wrong:

I have great experiences with Anycoin Direct ( You can use Sofort Uberweisung or Giropay to buy bitcoins instantly. Also, you don't have to verify yourself for orders less than 100€
@_date: 2015-06-09 16:54:35
Yes, I noticed that new feature, that makes all the difference I see.
When I use the normal (instant) feature I get:
1.00 BTC = 6847.2280 BLK
But when I specify the amount I want to exchange I get:
1 BTC = 7172.8635 BLK (this is about the same as I get on Cryptsy)
So when I use the instant (default) way it's about 4.5% fee (or spread, just how you want to call it)
Don't get me wrong, the service is great and I think fees are necessary if you want to do business. But please don't state that there are no fees when there are fees. (like for the instant exchange, the price is more expensive because of added fee/spread/costs).

Thanks for this great post! This is what we need!
One small note: There is no risk of chargebacks using iDEAL, this is the main reason Bitcoin in Holland is so big. These days the bitcoin companies like Bitplaats.nl only charge like +/- 0.5% more than Bitstamp. (this is because +/-12 companies in Holland are selling bitcoins instantly using iDEAL).

Dear MtGox Customers,"
Thank you for your patience this week while we are working on re-initiating bitcoin 
withdrawals. In addition to the technical issue, this week we have experienced some 
security problems, and as a result we had to relocate MtGox to our previous ofﬁce building 
in Shibuya (details can be found here  The move, 
combined with some other security and technical challenges, pushed back our progress."
As much as we didn’t want to only provide an “update on an update”, this is the current 
status. We are committed to solving this issue and will provide more information as soon 
as possible to keep everyone in the loop."
We are very sorry for the delays and deeply appreciate your kind understanding and 
continuous support."
 "
Best regards,"
MtGox Team

Any evidence?
@_date: 2014-02-17 14:32:04
There is no bitcoin 'main' server, also people can check their transactions on one of the other blockchain explorer. That's the power of the decentralized aspect of bitcoin.

If a company buys Mt.Gox they have to buy all, so also the possible debt.
So it means that all people will get their BTC back
@_date: 2014-02-13 12:36:26
Yes indeed, but I don't think the Chinese are doing this. Since the start BTC-e went down 35 minutes ago Houbi went down a little.
But I have no clue who's doing this.

BTC-e and Justcoin are processing withdrawals normally.
MtGox and Bitstamp are still not processing any withdrawals and did not communicate any ETA.
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:07:20
I wouldn't be surprised to see one of the big tech companies wants to get in to bitcoin with this. Like Paypal, Amazon or even Google

I think cloudflare is installing a new SSL certificate and there went something wrong with replacing it before the old one was expired. But no reason to panic, I think it will be fixed soonish

This problem has been posted 2 times before:
I experience the same thing, withdrawls aren't processed instant. 
Small bitcoin withdrawls are processed first and then the bigger ones. 
I had contact with Bitstamp and they said they did contact the system admin. But after that they are just not responding to our tickets..
@_date: 2014-02-14 10:05:43
But withdraw fiat wasn't a problem on Bitstamp, so I think the price will go up much more.
@_date: 2014-11-08 15:13:27
Users can use Bitreserve for not having the bitcoin volatility. The bitcoins are exchanged for USD but you can spend it as bitcoin.

Great, as long as the target website can be trusted ;)
Personally I think it's best to create an own platform and create an own reputation, redirecting will not create long term trust. 
I think with an domain like bitcoin.com it's worth the investment.

Shapeshift has always had high fees, some pairs are cheap (2-3%) but other pairs have very high fees (9%+). This has nothing to do with the spread, these fees are calculated with the orderbook/spread.

"The fight against terrorism and terrorist financing is a major priority for the G7. We
will continue to act fast and decisively, and will strengthen our coordinated action.
In particular we reaffirm our commitment to effectively implement the established
international framework for the freezing of terrorists’ assets, and will facilitate
cross-border freezing requests among G7 countries. We will take further actions to
ensure greater transparency of all financial flows, including **through an appropriate

From the email: What is a maker taker model? In a maker taker model, reduced fees are given to the market “makers” who provide liquidity to the market “takers”. The maker fee applies when you add liquidity to the order book by placing a limit buy below market price or a limit sell above market price. The maker fee is paid only when such orders are taken by new incoming orders. The taker fee applies when you remove liquidity from the book by placing a market or limit order that executes immediately against a limit order already on the book. All advanced orders trigger either market or limit orders and the triggered market or limit order will be maker or taker as described above.

I can certainly advice to go to Arnhem, it's a great feeling to be able to spend your bitcoins everywhere. 
Here you can find a map of all merchants that accept bitcoin:

In the city center you can spend bitcoins at many pubs, you can also spend your bitcoin in a hotel or at the local groceries store (Spar).
