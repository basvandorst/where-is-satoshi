Weird. I tried sending .01 BTC (gdax transfer minimum i guess) and it gave me an error saying
    Error: server did not answer

Anyone know how I can transfer $7 worth of BTC out of my wallet? I just sold off all my crypto yesterday and for some reason it left $7 in there and won't let me send it because it's too small

Good info thanks 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:18:34
hahaha how was it?

Lol dumb boss to risk his business by not paying taxes.

Yep thought it was just Coinbase's holding period.

I just had a very similar conversation with a friend yesterday about macroeconomic effects on bitcoin, and how the fact that its truly the ONLY known finite resource that we as people recognize as currency. Gold can be minded, money can be printed, bitcoin has 21M.
My gut feeling is that once all the coins have been mined, they will become a commodity just like baseball cards.

I'll look into it

most $ you're willing to pay

You're essentially replicating inflation through the money multiplier effect. If you can overspend, that mean the "bank" in this sense would have to lend it to you. If there's a finite number of bitcoin, and supply is really dictated by the availability, unless the "bank" has a large chunk sitting in a "vault," the "bank" would have to create a paper-bitcoin, in the same sense that you get a paper loan from a bank instead of them handing you a wad of cash. The only difference is there is no federal reserve setting rules for these "banks" requiring them to have a reserve %, so the risk of the "bank" going bankrupt from too much lending is extremely high

I haven't used Gemini, but I imagine they have stop loss sell option, which is basically your "get-out-and-run" price. It'll trigger a sale of X number of coins when the spot price hits your loss limit

I just paid almost $50 to transfer  $540 worth of BTC to my electrum wallet....not a huge fan right now....
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:10:42
None with fees like that...it doesn't require a flatbed for fucks sake

Lol you need to pick up a tax accounting 101 book. Even if its not fiat, it's still considered income. You now own an asset who's basis is its FMV. Doesn't matter if my boss pays me in cash or in bananas, he's still paying me.

Do my coinbase coins show up in gdax?
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:41:41
An order of that size would need to be executed through the exchange in person. No way coinbase is sitting on $190MM in cash
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:06:52
10% to move my own asset is ridiculous 
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:16:50
Ok I can't seem to figure out where on gdax im supposed to link my electrum wallet.

of course. Say the price of BTC for example is $1,000, and you can buy fractions. You could say, place a limit order for $800 at 0.5 BTC. Once the spot price of BTC drops to $800, it will trigger a purchase of 0.5 BTC for a total purchase of $400.
