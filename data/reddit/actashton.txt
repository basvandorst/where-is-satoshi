Matryx is a platform for decentralized collaboration that consists of a bounty system, a library of digital assets, and a marketplace. Problems are posted, along with a bounty that provides rewards. They problem solve and bring real life ideas/issues into VR that the community can help solve for MTX. Super intriguing project, check out their website: [Matryx](
