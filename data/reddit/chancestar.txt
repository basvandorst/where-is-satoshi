what's the point of acting so fake? Anything positive about BTC would get downvoted their. It's obviously the most toxic sub out of all crypto's.

no shit bitcoin has a ban list of thousands, look at how large it is. This sub is constantly being attacked and spammed 24/7. Getting tired of you fake ass people making these non sense comparisons. If that sub was anywhere near as large than it would be fair to compare but it's not.

if that's true, I don't think it's fair at all to attack this sub because of an abusive mod. People should come together to expose the mod and those actions, not talk down an entire sub that still has a good project.

This is a bitcoin sub, if you are here for something other than bitcoin than why are you here? BTC is suppose to also be a bitcoin sub but it's poisoned with BCH shills and then people like you come here acting fake as fuck.  
  
The simple fact BCH shills are using a BTC sub is more than enough proof to show how that crypto is a con.

this is apart of why banks are corrupt. They literally control your money and can even freeze your funds.

This sub isn't for 12 year olds. The fact your still using mom jokes that aren't even creative is pretty sad.

the key is to not use emotion. Always be the awareness behind your thoughts and emotions.
