Yes the UK will ditch GBP as soon as they leave the EU, they’ll make Swindon the capital city and kick the Queen out of Buckingham palace. C’mon man, have an opinion but make it an informed one.

I personally agree with some of sentiments here but will the ‘everyday person’ care to think this way when making financial decisions? This is what I am questioning. I suspect they might not.

Good points thanks for offering your take on it. Does this mean many of the benefits of using Bitcoin would only arise if the socioeconomic systems we have in place right now (which are not perfect by any means!) erode into a hyper-controlling somewhat authoritarian state?
What about the average guy/girl that does not think to care about how the powers that be may take what they have?

Also, with challenger banks such as Monzo &amp; Revolut making sending people money free &amp; instant, the idea of ‘low fees’ or ‘high speed’ do not seem like convincing benefits of using BTC.

Some great points here I’ve not considered, bots having an income is fascinating topic by itself! Will look further into some of this, thanks.

Nice, good point, financial robustness in times of difficulty would be of value to the ‘average joe’.

Interesting advantages, the ‘average joe’ would definitely be interested in discounts or concessions. Never considered how secure your data is when it simply isn’t there to be taken, I like it.
