Andreas Antonopoulos!
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:01:37
are you crazy?
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:36:07
remember you also have 19.5817 BCash which is worth ~$33,000 when Coinbase release it

might not be relevant but gdax put a really decent transaction fee for withdrawal that also speeds up the confirmations.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:33:22
Its 11k last week. Now its 14k and you called it dark time?
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:50:07
btc is on sale. It's not a big risk buying now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:00:37
thing got back to normal
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:14:36
I mean withdraw from (out of) gdax. It's free but they pay the fee for us.
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:45:50
on point

I have an order at 9412. At first it seems stuck and not fulfilled. I can't even cancel the order. Just 5 min ago it went through, the order got filled.
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:47:14
To be fair, am I smart holding BTC instead of USD - knowing the fact that USD will be worth less while BTC value increase?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:43:18
Sold at 10k, bought back at $9412.90. Happiest day of my noob-trading career :p
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:33:14
come to gdax mate. Huge sell walls at 9945, 9950 and 10000. On the other side, buy walls at 9850, 9825..
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:07:42
tbh I'm expecting a correction soon.. what goes up must come down
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:48
now your chance to buy in ;)

hi brother
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:30:48
I'm on gdax now but can't even cancel my order :(
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:23:22
it's 9975 now :)
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:15:13
drop ~50 bucks which is 0.5%
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:52:44
Very happy to have senior people like you in the community! Best wishes to you and your family :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:24:55
you missed the train buddy
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:31:08
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:55:50
next train coming soon. after the correction
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:56:24
** Volume Excluded - No Trading Fees. I think this is reasonable since it could be easy to manipulate the price if there is no trading fee
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:52:19
good move bud. its crashing now
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:50:28
it's crashed :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:10:15
This hype is insane. I'm a bitcoin fan but honestly I don't want its going up this fast. Higher entropy, bigger crash.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:21:17
Holy $hit it just dropped 1k in seconds 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:16:09
the hype is too strong right now. mostly FOMO. beware the collapse :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:56:03
the force is too strong!!
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:26:09
Send your bitcoin to gdax then send it to your nano s without fee
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:44:43
the demand is still high... until we hit that 10k wall I guess
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:17:56
Just put $2k in will be $2.1k tomorrow :)
