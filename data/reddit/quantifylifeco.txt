The world is moving toward eliminating transaction fees, I don't see how a node will be profitable when Lightning is fully adopted. Am I missing something here? I'm all about improving blockchain services, but will a node or nodes last as a profitable investment? Excuse my ignorance, I bought my Bitcoin in early 2016, forgot about it, and resurfaced just a few months ago. Now I'm looking for opportunities.

Okay, so I'm fuzzy on the technology but I have one question. How can I profit from Lightning? This seems like the next big step.

Anyone (me) could recreate these crypto services and become the mode widely accepted and used just by being the most honest and trustworthy. In the world of Bitcoin, security seems to be more important than aesthetics and ease of use.

Buddy, just wait until the only friends you have start being your friend just because you have money. At least she's not asking you to  buy x, y, and z for her.

I guess I could say that's good for me, because the only thing I'm good at is security... I'm a shitty developer

Thanks. I knew there were Bitcoin gambling sites, but I can do it better so I was just exploring the idea. Do you know if there is a legal way to go about it?

That's the end goal, right? If that's your only option, you know you've made it. Lol

The risks we take...

Yeah, but I'll post that in the appropriate thread. Stay posted.

I definitely think the Reddit community has more knowledge about bitcoin than my lawyer

Yeah I get that, but do you know if there is a legal way to go about it?
