That's not really proportional risk. If a criminal has stolen bank account information and they're just looking to cash out then they won't be looking for the best deal on the market. They're going to look for someone like Bob who is comfortable sending strangers his money without any kind of background check.
This kind of exchange is going to rely on the reputation and transparency which places undue burden on its users and it's prohibitive to growth. Now you'll have third party reputation exchanges that will exist to verify user integrity.

And what if Alice turns out to be Carl who stole Alice's bank account? Now Alice will do a chargeback and Bob is screwed. This sort of exchange would only work locally with people who know and trust each other. That's the entire point of a BTC exchange. They bear the risk of the chargeback in exchange for a fee.

It's not really a Bitcoin vs *coin issue. Bitcoin is a reference implementation of Satoshi's paper. People are free to copy, redistribute, and build newer and better cryptocurrencies so that in the end the world is based on a sounder financial system.
There are some pretty valuable lessons to learn from Dogecoin. Mainly that a high total cap on the currency reduces the barrier to entry. Maybe there is some sweet spot that is yet-to-be-found which will increase stability (i.e. maintain low volatility with near zero inflation/deflation) while impelling people to download the client and start mining coins *for fun*.
It's all one big cryptographic/economic experiment, so might as well increase the diversity of the tests.

Honestly there are a bunch of shitty jobs on there.
Some of my thoughts:
* Get rid of unpaid startup internships. Seriously what is the point in that?
* Set a minimum job amount for freelance (if you want people to visit your site then take a page from gun.io)
* Mandatory escrow for bounties.
* Caching. It's 2014. If you're not going to build a smart client app then at least cache the content to make page reloads quicker.
Other than the glaring points I feel the BTC ticker is too busy. Try to get one that changes once every 10 minutes instead of real time. Also try to use millibitcoin as a unit since dollar parity makes BTC less intimidating.

Honestly opening an exchange is like opening a bag of dicks. There are insane amounts of regulation and the capital requirements are high.
The reality of the situation is regulation stifles innovation, but from a different perspective the idiots who keep throwing their money at Mt Gox make a very compelling case for these regulations.
As much as I advocate for free markets it's downright dangerous (for consumers and Bitcoin itself) to have these sort of bad actors persistent in the market and there's seemingly nothing we can do to flush them out.

That is what is implied. There is no government backing of bitcoins and I hope it never happens.
If bank runs were to happen today, banks would be screwed if the government wasn't constantly inflating the currency. Most money is digital i.e. Federal Reserve Notes aren't kept on hand. For all intents and purposes Federal Reserve Notes are *worthless* at this point in time. Not to mention I would say a good people, like myself, live off credit.


Libertarians such as myself believe The Fed is a scam and the interventionist economic policy will ruin the U.S.. It's all a matter of time, with the current spending/debt, before the TSA gets replaced with the army and marshal law is declared. The government does not respect the constitution and bitcoins are the perfect opportunity to either strengthen the dollar or undermine it.
It can honestly go either way at this point. The dollar isn't backed by any deflationary commodity, like gold, so the dollar is devaluing by the day. All that is needed now is "paper" bitcoins and consumer confidence. I plan on implementing the former and the market will deal with the latter.

One does not own Bitcoin. One owns the public/private keys which are used to access Bitcoin.
Bitcoin remain in the blockchain and cannot be taken out because they only exist in the blockchain.
The blockchain is the central authority that regulates Bitcoin. For all intents and purposes this could be considered the Bitcoin program itself which the majority of nodes use.
Bitcoin is a new concept because Bitcoin is regulated by the people that use it. The program acts as the laws of how to use Bitcoin. Essentially the Bitcoin program is a contract.

Although with features such as chargebacks there will be less freedom with one's bitcoins because of 3-72 hour confirmation on all transactions before one can pull his or her coins out of the bank.

"Fractional reserve" is legalized cheating because the bank is dishonest about how the funds that  are actually available. 
Though there is an honest approach to a fractional reserve system-- bonds. The bond market is like a bank for bankers in the aspect that time is the reserve from which the banks borrow. If the bank cannot fulfill the cash on hand it can either attempt to liquidate its bonds or issue the bonds directly to the creditor.

It'll be much like Dwolla (i.e. payment gateway for bitcoins). Right now there is a problem with IRL distribution to use Bitcoins for Debts. In other words one cannot simply go to a restaurant and pay in bitcoins without a smartphone ore something of that nature.
In the interest of using BTC as a currency and to solve this problem I am establishing the first "Bitcoin Bank." One can open an account, transfer in BTC, and I handle the rest.
The main challenge will be making it decentralized in structure, but I am holding off on that problem.
A general outline:
Transfer BTC in|Free|Transfer BTC into reserve account
Transfer BTC out|Fee based|Transfer BTC out of reserve account
Transfer between reserve accounts|Instant|Exchange funds
Printable Reserve Notes|Free|Print out BTC to use as cash or checks, scannable by smartphones or scanner, redeemable by other reserve account holders
Chargebacks|Free|Up to X* amount of hours able to charge back funds. X is yet to be determined.
Bonds|Fee Based|Certified or Anonymous BTC redeemable bonds which may only be cashed after a specified time
All services optional.
Future Plans:
* ACH payments
* Smartphone app (Android, iPhone, Java, mobile browser, etc...)

1\. What is Bitcoin and how much is it worth? 
Bitcoin is a digital online currency used to preform unregulated monetary transactions.
It is operated with a globally distributed account ledger known as the Blockchain which tracks Bitcoin transactions.
Bitcoin is traded mainly through barter or online currency exchanges.
Since Bitcoin is relatively young the value tends to fluxuate daily.
However, the general trend of the value is positive and the current value is around $114 USD.
2\. Are Bitcoin transactions safe?
All Bitcoin transactions are verified by the Blockchain and added about every 10 minutes.
Bitcoin ownership is verified through a long password that is generated for the user.
The password is very strong and the main method of compromise is through Hacking and Phishing.
Every transaction must include the password to identify who is spending the Bitcoin.
Once transactions are added into the Blockchain they cannot be undone.
3\. Why would I want to accept them as payment?
The Bitcoin user base is growing rapidly.
Transactions cannot be undone which means they are a secure payment method.
There are no fees to use Bitcoin.
It does not require any special payment equipment.
It is instant and anonymous.
4\. How can I begin accepting Bitcoin payments?

Well non-aggression is not the same as non-violence. While violence is inherently immoral and unethical there are those that will malevolently use it to achieve their own ends and there are some cases when non-violence will not be able to produce the same outcome as non-aggression (for example aggregative events such as genocide). Non-aggression advocates that violence is exceptional in response to explicit malevolent violence.

A summary of the changes.
He dumbed down the section on "Transactions" into a Bitcoin 101 titled "How Bitcoins Work."
He modified the history section and most notably removed the timeline. There were subtle references added such as, "the currency had early technical problems, and vulnerabilities were soon exposed such as a 2009 exploit that allowed the creation of unlimited Bitcoins and the mistaken creation in 2013 of two conflicting records of transaction history."
This is repeated down below in the "The fork of Match 2013" section.
Right after that he add, "That year also saw the first interventions by law enforcement. Assets belonging to a Bitcoin exchange were seized, and an online drugs market where Bitcoin was the preferred method of payment was shutdown."
He removed the "Regulatory issues" section.
From the "Economics" section he removed the "Exchanges" subsection.
He added a subsection called "Academic research and mention by Economists" which takes excerpts from the "Reception" section.
He removed the section "Implications" and split out subsections into "Privacy", "Energy use and environmental impact", "Theft and technical vulnerabilities", and "Criminal use."
My overall opinion is the reflow is decent, but the original content should be preserved (in the article or split out e.g. "History of Bitcoin" or "Bitcoin Technical Design").

@_date: 2013-05-09 10:02:46
Well the Bitcoin blockchain is public, so they don't even need to know about your wallet.
As a user I could give them my public key and they could listen to the blockchain for any transactions from that public key.
I could maybe have separate wallets for each "goal", so keeping track of goals would be simplified.
If they decided to incorporate an online wallet instead then they could host secure offline wallets to keep my Bitcoin safe.
@_date: 2013-08-14 15:11:49

Mt. Gox has dropped the ball several times already. Their US market is essentially worthless since trades only make profit from Bitcoin sold during panics.

Brand loyalty to Mt. Gox is irrelevant and superficial (just like Dwolla). Bitcoin wasn't created for the purpose of trading it at Mt. Gox. I will not deny Mt. Gox has contributed a great deal to Bitcoin, but it was done for their own self interests and I expect nothing less.
Not everything is ponies and unicorns at Mt. Gox and until they get their act together (which is highly unlikely) they should be avoided in favor of more competent exchanges. The only way to send a message is by lowering their volume.

In what sense? What prevents malware from stealing your wallet? The average consumer has a very basic understanding of computers much less Bitcoin.


Yes and no. Bitcoins are anonymous and not verifiable (like cash). You can also mistype someone's address and there goes your Bitcoins. There is also a transaction fee to transfer Bitcoins between wallets.


There's nothing preventing you from using Scottrade either.
In general for Bitcoin the succeed as a currency there are banking services that need to be established for non-technical people. Bitcoin is very principled, so fractional reserve banking is harder (but not impossible if you have enough external money they can be pumped in).

@_date: 2013-11-25 17:22:35
It's the capital gains depending on your jurisdiction.
For example in the USA:
There are 2 different capital gains rates (short term (less than 1 year), long term (more than one year)). Short term gains are taxed at income tax rates and long term rates are taxed at another rate.
If you bought 100 BTC at $1 and sold 10 BTC at $100 after one year then the capital gains would be (IIRC)
    federal liability = amount gained * federal taxable rate 
    state liability = amount gain * state taxable rate
= ($100 * 10 BTC) - ($1 * 10 BTC) * (tax rate)
= $990 * (federal tax rate) + $990 * (state tax rate)
Assuming you are single, make more than $8,351 and make less than $33,950, and live in Minnesota that would be 0% federal and 7.85% state.
= $990 * 0 + $990 * .0785 = $77.72 state tax
Assuming you are single, made more than $33,951 and made less than $82,250 and live in Minnesota that would be 15% federal and 7.85% state.
= $990 * .15 + $990 * .0785 = $148.50 federal tax +  $77.72 state tax  = $226.22 total tax
Obligatory this is not tax advice please consult your tax professional. The figures may differ from what is presented in this post.

You're probably not well versed in Libertarian philosophy. Once the aggressing party attempts to violate your life, liberty, or property then you have the right to take recourse. Assuming DPR adhered to the [NAP]( then he would have a clean conscience (although it does contradict US law).

You can regulate the Bitcoin network as well as you can regulate Bittorrent. That would depend on the ISPs blocking traffic and even then it wouldn't affect the bottom line since Bitcoin is global. However, they can regulate Bitcoin businesses and effectively ban Bitcoin purchases via money wiring. Although the Bitcoin network cannot be shut down the fundamental widespread use case of Bitcoin can be prohibited.
@_date: 2013-10-30 17:10:24
First rule of Bitcoin is don't listen to investment advice on Bitcoin forums. Depending on your strategy (low risk/short haul or high risk/long haul) you'll want to monitor the market. If the price starts to drop then get out and make a profit. If the drop occurs before you can act then hold and wait (don't cash out for a loss).
And do spend some Bitcoin.

*You vastly overestimate the technical proficiency of the average person.*


You need the private keys of both parties involved to establish the legitimacy of a transaction. These transactions are also one way which shifts the liability on the consumer to not fall prey to a [man-in-the-middle]( attack.


But it doesn't replace a cheque in any sense.
[Yes]( If your transaction fee is low or not present then it takes longer to process your transaction. One cannot expect transactions to be free once miners are no longer getting rewarded from mining blocks.


They exist, but they are not accountable to the consumer. There are also big trust issues with using online wallets which is why many would recommend against it.
Banking services will need to exist to facilitation low latency (and free between account holders) transactions, merchant services, payment on credit, debit cards, and hold long term Bitcoin assets in secure offline storage. Bitcoin banks will probably partner with exchanges (or run their own) in order to ease the conversion from local currency to Bitcoin and vice versa.
