You're mistaken. If btc drops in value in the meantime you won't have € 1000 worth of btc by the time you exchange it for the other coin. I mean, if you do it quickly enough it's unlikely the price will have changed much... but who knows, it's pretty volatile.

I'm extremely bullish on bitcoin, but if you're serious and not trolling, you have a lack of basic understanding of economics.

Besides comparing to GDP, you also have to access what's the interest rate paid on such debt. Brazil's debt/gdp ratio is lower than US', but not long ago the Brazilian interest rate was 14,25%.

No. It's actually quite common. The purpose of an ETF is to "follow" a certain asset's price, and that can be done by simply trading futures, no need to trade the physical asset. Commodities' ETFs for example pretty much only trade futures, no ETF manager wants to have the trouble of buying corn and shit...

Exactly. So we agree that bitcoin's current scenario is different from the one shown in this graph. Therefore, maybe we shouldn't assume that it's going to follow the same pattern. I'm not trying to be a dick here, I'm being genuine when I say "maybe". No idea what's actually going to happen.
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:40:27
No! Sorry, that's very wrong. That would actually drop the value to zero, since no transactions would be validated by the miners.

I find it amusing how most people here bash on the general public that talks about bitcoin not knowing shit. The same people are now talking about futures not knowing how this market works at all. You don't have to understand futures market to like or to invest in bitcoin, but if you wanna talk about it, hey, do your homework.

The problem with shorting a future is that you're obligated to do it. For example, if you take the short side at a bitcoin future  10,000, once the contract expires (let's say 3 months from now) you HAVE TO sell that amount of bitcoins in the contract for USD 10,000, even if the spot price is way above it.
On the other hand, there's this other type of derivatives called options. In this case, you can buy a put that gives a you the right (not the obligation) to put (sell) a certain amount of bitcoin at a certain price. Since you have a right and not an obligation and you can choose the price for which you're going to sell (whereas in futures the price is defined by the market) you have to pay a premium to have that option. In futures there's no upfront premium to be paid, so that's your tradeoff. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:16:33
Actually 3678%, but no biggie.
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:39:29
Sorry, made I wasn't very clear.
Regarding the options, naturally the premium prices are determined by the market, there's no such thing as arbitrary price. What I meant is that in options you can actually negotiate any strike (and pay more or less on the premium depending on how inside the money the option is), whereas in futures the "delivery price" for each maturity is non-negotiable.
Regarding the futures settlement, I didn't get your point. Yes, they are settled at the end of each day, but how does that make anything I said wrong? You still have to settle, it's not an option, whereas with options you only exercise if it's in the money for you (profitable).
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:29:51
Even though I agree with you that this amount is pretty irrelevant, it shouldn't be compared with other current well known future products. It should be compared with those products when they were first launched. It usually takes time for the market to actually jump into something new.

The punctuation in this "analysis" makes me cringe.
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:10:32
Ok, here's the math:
If you buy a bitcoin that costs $1,000 and then trade it for an altcoin that costs $10, you get 100 (1000 divided by 10) of such altcoin, correct?
Now that altcoin is worth $20 (meaning you know have $2,000 worth) and bitcoin costs $500, so when you do the trade back to Bitcoin, you get 4 bitcoins (2000 divided by 500). 4 bitcoins times 500 per coin is still 2,000, so your money doubled anyway.
I know this sounds a bit harsh and douchey, but if you couldn't figures this out yourself, you shouldn't be playing with this.

What you are saying makes no sense, the value of things depend on supply and demand (which might be affected by a variety of factors), this consensus that you're implying doesn't exist.

Forwards are actually mostly settled by cash. Yes, you can close your future position before maturity, but it will be at a cost that you wouldn't have if you simply let an out-of-money option expire.

You don’t have to actually understand how bitcoin works in other to use it as a currency, the same way you don’t have to understand monetary policy in order to use your cash or debit card.
But, if you want to see what’s under the hood, there you go.
@_date: 2018-05-06 16:30:35

One important tip (among many): do not leave your bitcoins on exchanges. Use your own wallet to store them, and preferably a hardware wallet.

I don’t think that an ETF has to necessarily be 100% backed physically. A lot of the ETFs being proposed on the US plan to replicate bitcoin’s price via the futures traded on CBOT and CME, and said futures are cash settled, so those ETFs wouldn’t be backed by any actual coin.

I’m 100% with you. That behavior is really annoying.
@_date: 2018-02-16 10:35:37
Depends on the type of shorters you’re talking about. In order to short via futures the coin itself isn’t necessary, it’s all done via cash settlement. And anyways the shorters could still short without exchanges, the same way you can buy or sell bitcoin without exchanges, it’s just (currently) harder.
Regardless of all that, even though us hodlers tend to not like shorters, it’s important to let the market do its thing.

They’re talking about a specific sample of investors, not the overall futures market, especially because you actually necessarily have the same amount of long and short contracts, that’s how futures work.

Really shallow analysis IMO, just a bunch of number, graphs, sensationalism and a deep lack of diligence. “No one talked about the VIX”. Really? In what world? Talking about Debt/GDP ratio as a single factor, without considering all the other variables is just bogus. Comparing a 80 bps CDS with Greece’s CDS? Yes, Deutsche ‘s CDS is way more expensive than before, reflecting the Banks’s poor results and therefore greater uncertainty regarding its ability to pay debt, but 80 bps is still faaaar way from what would be considered default level.
Don’t get me wrong, the system sucks and I’m forever bullish on bitcoin, but I just don’t like this type of analysis that just want to pray on the layman, regardless of it being pro or against bitcoin.

 What do you mean by “globally we all agree in gold’s value”? Gold’s value is determined by the market and its perception of gold’s worth, just as with bitcoin.
And what is this about CIA printing money?
The fact that banks are too big to fail, meaning that the government has come (and presumably will come) to the rescue was one of the catalysis for bitcoin’s creation. That’s known since the beginning and it’s one of the reasons crypto is so important.
