That tells me that they make at least $12 per month on the $1500 that you leave in the bank.

After many attempts to convince the sending party, he demanded PayPal. Cause: safer.
@_date: 2015-01-31 00:21:12
In this case he was prepaying. It would be a hard fight with Paypal if I did not deliver my half of the deal. Either way, I get that he was nervous I am mostly frustrated with PayPals gouging.

Are there growing supplies operations retailers/distributors that accept BTC? If not, that would be a really smart idea. Or create a commercial real estate property management tool rental bridge to accept BTC. Both seem like interesting startup ideas.
@_date: 2016-12-11 23:29:08
Yes the claim is, there are large groups that are sitting on cash trying to destabilize the economy. Does this do anything?

Technically or philosophically?
@_date: 2016-11-08 00:35:14
You are 100% right, but in Cali its old school farmer types ( with a slant obviously ). That seems to be different in areas where bigger money can be applied, such as legal states. What needs to change to get Farmers and distribution to use even a little BTC? Serious question for anyone.
@_date: 2016-12-15 16:59:05
Gotta agree, its less a technical reason than an economic one.

Thats like saying, owning stock in a company has no use. The entire stock market is built on the idea that "owning" a part of the company gives you a vote. And if you own enough, you might get an actually vote on a board for example. Not to different here.

I think you just agreed with me.
@_date: 2016-09-20 07:44:14
Is there a good read on the benefits of BTC being fully classified as money? I assume everyone thinks it will increase its value, but other than that why do you care what its classified as by different government orgs? It seems like there are more benefits in its current state.
@_date: 2016-09-14 17:50:31
I seem to have this fear with the hardware. I don't know why I have this fear. In theory u should have the same fear for open source software that I can't even really understand. Perhaps it's that with open source software I assume some others smarter then I have checked that out.
@_date: 2016-09-14 17:06:45
I like the idea. Isn't there a massive reliance on the receiving party, that the private key is not known by the sending party. The sender could know the private key through some hack in the firmware and release the funds before the receiver? I am only pointing out this fraud because it would seem the goal of the product is off chain transfers.

Rev share with each robot car. Treat them like contractors that pay off their own fees etc. Master Corp like Uber, basically skims profit off the top line with zero employee or infrastructure ( car ) costs. The margins on a model like this go through the roof.

No system can guarantee that a vendor does not do this. The paper specially describes this activity and a potential solution that sounds quite interesting.

It is really amazing watching Bitcoin mature, and go though the same issues the banking and credit card industry went though in the 90s.
Once, larger institutional investors get more involved, I think people will see the reasons for ISO certifications and PCI compliance.  
in the feels man.. sucks to lose that BTC.
