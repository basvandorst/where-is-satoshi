When it breaks $11,450 on the 6hr and the EMA12 is above the EMA26, then we will enter next bull run.
Having some trouble staying above $11,450 for at least 6hrs rn.

We better not let them use crypto because otherwise who is going to buy all the weapons the U.S. sells them and other middle eastern coutries. The U.S. hasn't transitioned yet, it's not fair to them! Iran could at least hold off on changing to crypto until the U.S. does. :))))))))

When the recession first hits, it is rumored Bitcoin will crash / dip along with the dollar. The important thing however is that Bitcoin will be the one to rise instead, after people realize that they shouldn't rely on something that goes into recession every decade.

So the guy says English isn't his native tounge and writes with run-on sentences, repetition, and poor grammar.
Yet the white paper on Bitcoin written by Satoshi Nakamoto is perfectly formatted, with strong sentences, words, and explanation.
Weird, guess he just got worse at English since 2008.

You make 6 figures and tell people online how much you make and the fact that you own Bitcoin, a currency that is highly volatile right now and expected to increase exponentially?

2 years later. Bitcoin is worth $100k. People searching the internet with query scripts locating for "I own Bitcoin" and similar messages.
@_date: 2019-06-20 03:16:17
First would be panic, it would drop as people freak out and want to take out their USD.
Then after they realize they need to stop relying on USD they will pour back into BTC.

(unrequested TA, blah blah blah)
* June 3rd - Enter bear market
* June 6th - Slow recovery and stability on the 1h
* June 8th\* - Reclaim $8,000 range of +-100
* June 10th\* - Reclaim $8,400 range of +-200
* June 17th\* - Reclaim $9,000 range of +-100
Based this on the 6h and the last time the EMA12/EMA26 flipped (April 26th - May 1st) considering it looks like a similar five day date range (June 3rd - June 8th\*).

@_date: 2019-06-15 07:29:00
The overbought was what happened two weeks ago. This should be it climbing back to where it should have been by now.
@_date: 2019-06-06 11:18:08
Yup. But thankfully what happened this time was just a bug and nothing to worry about at the moment.

Copypasta now
@_date: 2019-06-15 09:12:26
I'll have to recheck the charts I follow, but I don't think we will be back at 6k any time soon. Our pullbacks mainly are around 9k, 12k, and 15k I believe. We did 9k, so next one should be after we climb to 12k but that's a wild guess!
@_date: 2019-06-21 19:47:43
The seller Trezor on Amazon should suffice?
@_date: 2019-06-06 11:03:08
So far I've heard they're moving amounts from secure wallet(s) to accessible wallet(s). Perhaps preparing for a spike in price in which they can sell. Who knows.
@_date: 2019-06-15 07:33:00
Been in the scene for 2 years or 2 months? Cause my GF would know better than that and I tell her just a bit about crypto..
@_date: 2019-06-20 08:35:12
First of all I'd be mind blown and then I would probably ask why he hasn't sold any coins considering he says he wants to retire all the time.
@_date: 2019-06-19 10:54:43
Libra is a stable coin.
It's price will fluctuate only a couple cents.
People who will only 'invest' in Libra wouldn't have invested in Bitcoin in the first place. However, they may look into Bitcoin in the future if they feel like Libra is useless and they have some understanding of using crypto currency.
@_date: 2019-06-24 05:35:01
Yeah I get annoyed not seeing my whole number but with fees it will be impossible.
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:23:24
Yep that too!
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:25:09
By 2021 correct. But this is just an example rainbow, it was created with no connection to how Bitcoin is developed and taken by the human population.
If everyone started using Bitcoin as a global currency starting tomorrow and the price went way up, the chart would be inaccurate, but it necessarily wouldn't be a bubble. So take it with a grain of salt.

People think they'll become a millionaire no matter what. This is just another new avenue.
Why do you think the top 1% get away with everything? It's because regular people think they will be in that 1% some day, so they let laws pass that would benefit them in the future they never get to.

Correlation but unsure if causation.

Oh, okay, haha. Cheers and my apologies for not being able to read the sarcasm. Enjoy your weekend!
@_date: 2019-05-31 08:04:08
Since whales had some fun today, we're back down to the 8.2 range.
Prediction is 8.2k range +-200 today and tomorrow, then back up to 8.4k this weekend. Once the week starts again we should see a bull run from 8.4k range to 9.1k during the first week.
Compared charts and took into account the recent news from the trade war, as well as the end of week and month paychecks. Not to mention summer starting and more people having time to pay attention to the markets.
FOMO will begin at 9.1k when it is steady and really pick up at a steady 10k
Edit: volume is also extremely high right now. 25b market in 24hrs!!
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:02:22
Yes, let's write a full fledged TA on a Reddit post 40 people are gonna read. Worth the time.
@_date: 2019-05-29 14:52:54
Apparently I have to put it in bold or people think I'm telling them it's 100% going to happen.
@_date: 2019-05-26 09:29:48
Price stability looks similar to the $8k hold before the bull run in Dec 2017 to $19k
$8k stable ~&gt; wait ~&gt; $10k stable ~&gt; wait ~&gt; $19k high ~&gt; $16k low ~&gt; wait ~&gt; $19k ath
Also, similar bullish and bearish traits to the May 3-8 jump from $5k to $8k
Prediction still:
Today/this weekend: $8000~ range; +-100
Monday/end of month/start of June: bull run begins
Keep an eye out this week!
Edit: posting tracking predictions here 
@_date: 2019-05-28 19:26:39
Been right 7 days in a row....
I say *range* not that it will hit it.
I've been in the exact range 7 days in a row.
I also predicted the jump on Monday 3 days before it happened.
Go complain elsewhere. I have every right to speculate and I don't have enough energy to validate your existence every single day you reply. So cheers.
@_date: 2019-05-25 08:58:51
This weekend: $7800~ range: +-$200
Then Monday (or until June 1st) onwards will be the beginning of the bull run towards $10k in accordance to activity over the last month and 1h patterns.
Edit: This weekend may hold $8000~ range: +- $100
@_date: 2019-05-28 07:59:35
**This is just speculation and prediction.**

Again, they can't be biased as per their own research methods. They can explain block chain and cryptocurrencies, but specific to Bitcoin they won't do it.
@_date: 2019-05-26 19:05:12
Y'all gonna keep gatekeeping people from making predictions? Or should I go ahead and give you guys validation and pretend to comply with your superiority complex. LMAO.
No one knows what will happen. I'm looking at patterns and making my own predictions. Whales can change the market in an instant. The market is affected by a surplus of things like personalities, governments, businesses, etc.
Get off your high horse and have some fun.

Upset you didn't buy at $3k, it's okay
@_date: 2019-05-14 18:15:46
If they were to make a video it would have to be on CryptoCurrency as a whole and not bias to a specific coin or token.
Otherwise, they could just buy some btc, release their video which will gain attention, and then make a profit off of maybe a push in a direction to get btc going.

Every day (except Sunday) for the past week it's the same.
It goes up a good percentage and once it hits it's peak for the day, it'll drop around half of it and then regain it through the night PST and then reach a new peak. I've been watching it steadily for the past 10 days. It's easy to read right now. Just because you see it drop to 7.6 means nothing. It does this *every day*
@_date: 2019-05-14 01:16:50

It's because SJWs are too vocal. Most people don't care enough, but when everywhere you go is just people screaming in all caps to boycott something, your mind wants to either join in to be a part of something social or completely distance yourself from the SJWs and the thing they're boycotting.

The market will correct.

You understand diamond value was created the same way?
It isn't even the prettiest if the jewels, there are so many others. Diamonds were marketed to the point people started agreeing they were valuable.
Bitcoin is the same way, but digital. The reason why Bitcoin or another coin I guess will stay valuable is because we as humans like to hold value in items.
It used to be bartering, then the color purple, then silk, then gold and diamonds. Now it is crypto.
@_date: 2019-05-30 07:50:39

Perfect storm for that push to $10k

Hit 8.2k and dropped to 7.6k since EU/Asia will be heading to sleep. We should see 8.5k or higher tomorrow afternoon PST.
