Currently, it is quite set in stone in our source code. We'll be only changing it if we detect a major flaw. The 2WP is an hybrid multisig-drivechain custodial. The post is talking about "any" 2WP, not just ours. That 's why it talks about all the consensus systems.

Thanks Kanzure. I think I saw you typing at an incredibly speed in the conference.

The RSK blockchain uses SBTC (Smart BTC) pegged to Bitcoin 1:1 for its native cryptocurrency. That's the cryptocurrency you use to pay for transaction fees.

The platform is in BETA. That's why. Soon no registration will be needed.

As soon as segwit is activated, we've ready our drivechain soft-fork BIP and implementation to reduce the trust in the federation even more.

I'm also very dissapointed that an annonymous_user didn't even read the paper to present any fact for or against LTCP. 
The good news is that there is still time to go and read it. It hasn't been locked under a paywall (yet).
Best regards, Sergio.
@_date: 2017-03-04 05:32:26
Yes, this guy Sergio gets on my nerves! Always saying optimistic things about Bitcoin....don't he realize being optimistic is old fashioned?
@_date: 2017-03-04 05:36:27
Because it's much harder to reduce transaction fees based on a variable-compression scheme that depends on other transactions. A user can specify exactly the fees for the blockchain space he consumes: if he consumes 5 bytes, then he pays for 5 bytes (also he has to pay for the remaining factors in transaction cost).
@_date: 2017-03-04 05:37:59
I'm not good a writing in English (not my mother tongue). Any suggestion is welcomed.

We can't say it was Satoshi. But the pattern started with block 1. It would be highly preferable the miner to be Satoshi. If it's Satoshi, I'm confident the coins will never move. If it's not Satoshi, then the risk of these coins being spent is higher.
@_date: 2017-03-04 05:27:27
First, I'm free to express my feelings in my own tweet channel as I like. I never asked anyone to re-tweet any of my tweets did I ? I've even created a hashtag for that : 
Second, It's remarkable that I had achieved the same as "dozens of people", so I feel flattered. Thank you Mark.
Third, while it's true that I was heavily inspired by Greg's transaction cut-through and Harry Potter's MimbleWimble, there is nothing similar to transaction cut-through (compressing a chain of payments where a destination is the next transaction sender) nor anything related to MimbleWimble (hiding amounts) in the LTCP paper available for you to download at rsk.co website. What did you smoke?
Fourth, show me a link to a bitcoin core roadmap where it says: "remove old signatures from the blockchain by replacing them with new aggregated signatures FROM THE SAME source.". There will never be such as step in core's roadmap because, stated as I did, it's against core idea of privacy, which I respect.
Fifth, if you had been present in yesterday's LTCP presentation at the BitDevs NYC meetup, you will have learned that there is no loss of privacy (you can use different accounts for each payment channel) and there IS multi-sig!
But I grant you a point: the LTCP transaction format is completely, radically, essentially and unconditionally incompatible with Bitcoin transaction format.
Best rewards, truly yours, Sergio.

There is a coinbase that is part of the Satoshi pattern that was used to pay to Dustin Tremmel. 
@_date: 2019-03-13 12:31:57
So sad people are still negating this in 2019. 
The "Satoshi-like" coins are identified by 3 INDEPENDENT methods:
1. The slope of the extranonce
2. The LSB of the nonce restricted to a range
3. The fact that they are ALWAYS unspent (except one coinbase).
The probability this happens by chance has been calculated before, and it's  (1/5)^20000 or about 2^-40000. 
@_date: 2019-03-25 00:05:02
I don't care. What is true is true, even if all reddit community thinks otherwise. The earth is round. Satoshi mined 1M coins. True is true. is true. is true. is true.
@_date: 2016-11-14 13:07:34
This is getting funny. 
First, nobody can patent an idea of another person that has been made public (or he can try, but that patent won't stand in court).
Second, I don't understand why some people are so focused on RSK, while there are 100 Bitcoin companies much more powerful than RSK that have absolutely no intent to pledge the DPL, and having Bitcoin patents.  This is an evident double-standard.
The only reason I find for such meaningless pressure on RSK is because RSK (and Blockstream) are the only companies working for the community at the platform level, with long term plans, and without any get-rich-fast speculative token or intent.
So they fear us because we're doing something big.
Having said that, RSK might pledge DPL in the future, but as a company we need to discuss it.

Done! thanks! I wrote yesterday's night, so I was too sleepy to take care of format. Also, as English is not my native language, it may contain grammar mistakes.

This method can be used by any merge-mined sidechain to increase its security without reducing the block rate.
RSK activated the consensus change required to use it yesterday.
@_date: 2017-04-01 02:36:57
Not if you side with me. If you side with me it can be achieved in the following months.

If you don't hardfork to something that still preserves Bitcoin value proposition of decentralization, you may have to hardfork to another PoW with no real security, if BU splits with 80% of the hashing power.
Do you still think we have a choice NOT to hardfork? I'm not sure we do. Therefore I want to have a backup plan. segwit2mb is a backup plan.
@_date: 2017-04-19 19:31:01
Also you're not seen this from an attacker's perspective. If an attacker wanted to do a 51% blockchain reversal attack, he would surely use ASICBOOST, and therefore he will only need to reach 41% of the network hashrate to out-compete the honest miners. That's why the honest miners must use ASICBOOST to prevent being out-competed.
@_date: 2016-02-12 16:11:36
Hi Paul. Yes we WILL migrate whenever the peg is ready. That's part of the contract with federator members. We don't like centralization and we'll get rid of it as soon as we can.
Regarding being slow to respond... I was on vacations! However I'm thinking about Rootstock 24/7...
@_date: 2017-04-01 02:55:40
Less than 5%.  I'm not fine if more than 5% of the community disagree. Sadly it is very difficult to measure it. I can only hear the voices of industry leaders, core developers, miners and reddit users.
@_date: 2017-04-01 02:53:08
We can only guess now the cost of transactions in RSK. In one side Bitcoin can subsidize RSK transactions, because miners are interested in seeing a new market for complex smart contract denominated in btc rise. On the other side, as the RSK VM is faster than many ETH VMs (this was true the last time I did performance comparisons), and because we plan to implement the LTCP protocol that reduces the space transactions occupy onchain, I think fees can be several times lower.
@_date: 2017-04-01 02:49:20
We have two BIPs one with segwit and the other without segwit. We've only implemented the one that depends on segwith, because it's much simpler than the other.
@_date: 2017-04-01 03:48:54
Side 1: No hardforks. We want this soft-fork.
Side 2: We don't want that soft-fork. Let's do a hardfork!
Side 3: Let's so both.
The next day after they all opted for option 3:
Side 1: Let's do Shnorr signatures now!
Side 2: Yes, good idea. Let's do it.
End of the story.
@_date: 2017-04-01 04:26:59
I don't think he will change, not do I think HF-opponents will change. I think both can make a parenthesis on their long term ideals and accept segwit2mb now, so see how LN works, to get a sense of how the future of Bitcoin can be.
@_date: 2017-04-01 02:33:13
I agree with you. The best option for a 2MiB+SW hardfork is spoonnet, and spoonnet did not get enough traction. So that is a dead end now. Therefore, we must find a simpler compromise solution. The best solution to compromise is one that modified the code as little as possible: that's how the segwit SF + 2MB HF comes into play. It's no more than 100 loc. It can be audited very easily. It is an improvement. It can untangle the current conflict.
@_date: 2017-04-01 04:30:09
Sadly there is no way to say how many proponents exists for a block-size increase, nor how many anti-HF users exists. Bitcoin was not created with an embedded voting system. 
I don't think it is only one miner that wants a block size increase.
@_date: 2017-04-06 14:34:24
By advocacy for "hardfork segwit" you mean segwit2mb ?
I remind you that segwit2mb prevents obfuscated asicboost, just like segwit does.
You can check that in the repo here: 
@_date: 2017-04-01 04:25:08
We will never reach hard-fork consensus for such a huge change! It will need to be deployed as a soft-forked extension block or as a sidechain.
@_date: 2017-04-01 02:28:00
My personal opinion is that it requires between 8 months and 16 months. In the last year, more than 91% of the nodes updated, without any hard pressure to do so.
@_date: 2017-04-01 03:37:41
Until now I have not received such request.
@_date: 2017-04-01 03:43:52
Do you think politics have not been involved in Bitcoin development since 2009? OP_EVAL was not rejected because it was technically inferior: it was rejected because a combination of risk-aversion, and mere fear of breaking things. 
Anyway, this does not set a precedent: there can be many more deadlocks in the future independently of what happens now. 
You can still oppose to any future improvement proposal.
@_date: 2017-04-01 02:35:24
Matt Corallo reply reads like he didn't read the original message. It is a compromise POLITICAL solution. It has nothing to do with being the best technical solution. The best technical solution is spoonnet, and spoonet is currently not going forward. So we need a solution, and we need it before Bitcoins splits and looses its 1st position in market cap/volume/network effect.
@_date: 2017-04-01 02:44:36
Segwit is top priority for many companies. segwit2mb will allow us to use segwit and keep innovating on Schnorr signatures, MAST, drivechains, sidechains, etc.
Time is money and Time is opportunity.

Nils Schneider discovered in 2010 an optimization of the same kind as ASICBOOST to get 70% speedup in Bitcoin mining. 
He he may have used it covertly before reporting (we don't know).
This was 2010-07-27.
Satoshi added the optimization to Bitcoin source code.
This optimization is of the same family as ASICBOOST. Nil's optimization removed a full SHA256 compression/message expansion.
You can see the diff here:
The commit is r113: "tcatm's cached SHA256 state idea, about 70% faster generating"
Nobody called this an attack.
@_date: 2017-04-01 02:26:35
That is exactly what I have done. It's good we agree.
@_date: 2017-04-01 11:27:12
I respond yo each of your statements: 
1. segwit2mb gives companies one year to  review, implement, test, re-network validate the hard fork. Yet it can be tested in much less time.
2. I took one year for 91% of the companies to upgrade to 0.12+ when there was an operational pressure to do so (dynamic fees). So the industry is ok with one year in advance.
3. The cost of validating a 2-4Mb block (including segwit) in the current state of Bitcoin Core (which has been greatly optimized for this) was discussed several times (including in ScalingBitcoin) and the results shown to me and the community by core devs were all positive.
4. It does NOT delay segwit. segwit is activated as soon as 95% of the treshold is reached. IT can be locked-in in one month. The proposal uses a second nVersion versionbit to signal both activations (segwit+2mb), but the activation times are different. No upgrade has to take place now.
You say "How about a compromise: activate the existing compromise."
Don't tell that to me. Tell that to the people who do not want that compromise. I'll be 100% ok with segwit if 95% of the community also approved it.
As of the amount of work required to deploy Segwit2mb, take into account that several core-developers reviewed the patch in about 30 minutes. It's 120 lines in length. I has 220+ lines of test cases. The patch can also be easily ported back to 0.13.1., so upgrading is even easier.
@_date: 2017-04-01 02:47:26
As you know, there is no voting system in Bitcoin. The only way to find out how much support there is from the USERS is to write an RFC and wait for user comments. Until now I have not received any comment stating that they would prefer staying on the original chain if 95% of the community switches to a new chain. 
@_date: 2017-04-01 03:46:02
Bitcoin must resist changes from external parties. It doesn't need to resist a compromise solution from its own community.

Rootstock is fully alive and going forward at full speed. Out team has grown to 10 engineers, plus other business people. The silence means we're very concentrated on this important milestone.
We don't have a official teamspeak channel, yet.
Although we're delivering our announce release on time, the official launch of Turmeric will be on the laBitConf: (laBitConf.com) on the first days of November.

No I didn't make that mistake. The segwit2mb code is based solely on weight increase. But during development everyone makes mistakes. That why we have alpha, beta, and production development cycles. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 12:06:46
I dedicated 2 weeks to audit Segwit back in 2016. I even discovered problems in segwit nobody did.
There was no mistake in the initial BIP draft, but it wasn't clear that the no-segwit block size was done by increasing the weight. This was corrected two days after, when one core dev commented on this. That's part of the BIP development process. I don't expect any draft to be perfect.

Similar concept for Lumino (RSK) I briefly presented in Consensus 2019 as TRUBEN: Trustless Batch Exit Nodes. They perform submarine periodic swaps serving a number of users.
