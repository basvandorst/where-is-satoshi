Please avoid using Copay until they add segwit. copay was busier including BCH than investing in Bitcoin.

Leverage on their wallet to accept bitcoin as well...  and also accept payments for their services like Gmail Enterprise or Google Ads

I'm leading PampaBits  development so I wanted to chime in here. PampaBits formally kicked off development at the time of the Latin American Bitcoin Conference Dec'13 where we took advantage and started branding our site. 
Currently working on multiple dimensions, legal, security, taxing rules.. that takes some time if you want to do the right thing and create a great market for the country....
So be patience, we'll be online soon! :) we are still working on it... you can follow us on facebook.com/pampabits as well

Any idea on why he wrote that tweet about Bitcoin Cash? All BCash supporters are picking that tweet as a very important endorsement 
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:43:00
I'm not sure it's all about spammers because if Spammers were taking let's say "half" of the blocks even when fees were like 5-10 dollars.. that was too expensive to maintain... so I'm not sure that was the spam as the spam was most likely on the lower end of the fees and not with fees that would actually get confirmed into the block
@_date: 2017-09-22 21:53:16
if both hold high value, and B2X has both low fee and long term scaling potential, why would you assume it's good choice to sell it?
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:59:40
Before fees in sat/byte goes up or the price goes up significantly it’ll be good if we start thinking of how to optimize UTXOs
For example if I need to send 0.12btc and the wallet finds that I have two UTXO that adds to 0.12003. And also another UTXO with 0.24... what would the wallet chose?
If it picks two UTXO I’ll end up having 0.00003 most likely unspendable money or if y use 0.24 I may receive change that I can use later? 
Or what if the wallet give me the advice of using the full 0.120003 so I do not create change back?
Or what if we improve the code so all those small changes can be consolidated somehow differently?

people moving to Eth?. that doesn't work given what's happening with ETH price at the moment

I agree Vertisnow with you, unfortunately people is using buzz words that get the general public to align without knowing exactly what are they aligning to. 
It's hard to believe when you see so many people voting against having lower fees because of "CEOs, Centralization, and other buzz words" that are very difficult to prove. It sounds like hearing Trump using "Terrorism fear" to gain votes or hearing "Maduro" talking about "imperialism" to also get everybody to vote for him although both are a terrible cancer for our society
Here you have arguments like "you are not seeing the forest for the trees" or "2x is not the problem but the way it's being implemented" and all that bullshit. There were many opportunities to implement this before and simply nobody wanted to test
So now, bitcoiners need to accept two things: Higher fees / erratic fees; and also that it's only Core Devs in charge. 
Core Devs are awesome, nothing against that, but Bitcoin is open source so no one group rules the game
Unfortunately, given that most of the people are confused with this fantasy of corporate takeover, then it's hard to introduce a hard fork causing so much disruption....  so I agree that there should be a proper replay protection
So sad to see this ridiculous discussion... Bitcoin could be much much bigger today than what it is and it's very unlikely that censorship resistance would be at risk if we go for 2x... to the contrary....

not really that I would mine but I know people that is mining and they still don't know what are they going to receive
@_date: 2017-09-22 20:06:04
What would make people sell B2X?. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 02:38:08
Are you sure that they will support both coins?
@_date: 2017-09-22 17:29:54
Good points, I believe it'll be helpful if someone starts selling "futures" so we can see where the market cap may land.. and then we can have a more reasonable transition.
with regards to the name, it's the toughest part... who owns the name?. I was discussing with a friend the following scenario:
1X has very low hashrate and is susceptible to an attack, so then CoreDevs launch an emergency hardfork to switch to PoS. Then in that case, who will be Bitcoin?
What if that event ends up with some people saying that they don't want PoS and request CoreDevs to put Replay Protection from it?.
Coming back to the mining hashrate, let's say that finally 2X ends up with 40% of the price and 1X 60% (no clue if this is a ratio but just for the sake of this discussion). Miners that started mining 90% of 2X would rebalance until they end up 60/40 but in both cases they will lose money until difficulty adjusts. Do you know how long it would take then to adjust difficulty until it's profitable? Because I foresee a scenario where it's not profitable in both chains until it adjusts

With regards to the Scaling RoadMap, it's clear to me that there is no intention to accept that discussion for real. Blocksize increase won't happen in the near-term which is silly because it's clear that current size won't be sufficient; it's also clear that increasing blocksize by itself does not mean that blocks will be always full (just look at BCH blocksize) but is clear that with the same argument that those proposing 2X are trying to gain power over Core, I can say that Core does not want to lose any power even if that's at the expense of impacting users with high fees.

I didn't review that part but it was surprising becuase on Wednesday we had that issue although it was not happening in the previous days where we also had more blocks per hours than average

Bitex.la in Buenos Aires office has a real version of that one. Here is the picture 
It’s a beautiful collage of multiple elements

nop I live in Argentina and everytime I open it it starts from Spain so I need to swipe until I bring it down to Argentina :)
@_date: 2013-12-24 20:08:42
I like the idea. It needs to be organized by a well known institution where they can confirm how much money we need to collect and then all of us drop some funds for that purpose

Guys, trading volume in China can be completely fake as Market Makers can easily do self purchases to create volume there..   when you read those volume numbers may not be completely accurate

is there any way in which I can have my Bitcoind but with a wallet.dat that does not have the private keys?. For security reasons I only need to have public keys with BitcoinD (I know I can do that in Armory but I need a way to do that as part of my BitcoinQT
@_date: 2013-12-29 23:03:15
thanks, it's because I have a software that is running some commands on bitcoinD so I don't think Armory works unless you can run command line type of instructions in Armory as well
@_date: 2013-12-29 23:04:35
thanks everyone for your quick responses.. I'll look at the different option.. my need is specific to bitcoind as I can run command line type of instructions..
@_date: 2013-12-28 23:11:57
Are you referring to bitmap? I have it already and like it very much.. But unfortunately it always open in Spain and does not bring me to my location automatically
