It's also possible that OP might not be skilled at explanation or debate/rhetoric. I've yet to hear an unintelligent, bombastic ignorant person who couldn't eventually be cornered logically or bombarded with facts until they at least had to tap out with something feeble like "well all's I know is...". Note I said "unintelligent" because there are plenty of intelligent bombastic ignorant people who are much trickier to pin down. But OP's own description of his expertise and apparent lack of confidence makes me consider that he may not yet be the most verbally skilled defendant of crypto currency. Though I would encourage him to continue to debate it with hostile opponents because, with practice, it's a learnable skill.

What about buying (with a prescription) legally online from Canada? Have they made that illegal yet? I did it a few years ago with no problem, saved a lot of money.

What was the cure for the fungus?

I'm inspired by OP's post, but it's going to be corporations -- cost savings for B2B payments -- that is the primary driver of large scale bitcoin adoption in the nearer term. That's where the big investments are being made. The mainstream consumer wave will follow, just like mainstream ecommerce followed EDI in the 90s.

Ah, I see. Thank you for clarifying.

No government will ever want to create a currency with a fixed quantity, as it would negate their ability to inflate away their national debt.
