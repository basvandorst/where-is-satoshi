Why should crypto income not be taxed? All income is taxable.
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:25:09
I think it’s important to note that you are only taxed once you convert BTC to USD or another crypto currency.
Example 
you buy 1000 usd of bitcoins on 2018-01-01 and then then exchange them back to USD on 2019-01-01 for 3000 usd. The profit is 2000 usd. So, you are taxed on the 2000.
If you never convert your BTC then you will never be taxed.
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:05:40
This looks like a scam
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:11:02
She should focus on Brexit first. She can’t even get consensus in her own party
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:31:59
Maybe people want the price to go down to 8k
@_date: 2018-01-26 07:00:41
Paying for stuff internationally is a huge pain and slow. We no longer need to go through many intermediaries.
Bitcoin wasn’t designed for tax evasion
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:22:00
Yet they take really Russian money for fake news
@_date: 2018-01-26 11:02:33
Democratic governments report to voters. If people want bitcoin then their governments will not ban it
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:21:08
Why can’t you get a GPU? I have 10 on my desk 
@_date: 2018-01-27 09:42:49
Those clickbait boobs
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:00:08
It’s seen as property by most governments. You should thus ask should governments tax the profits made on property.
@_date: 2018-01-27 10:09:24
Yeah it’s true, prepare for your cheeks to get busted
@_date: 2018-01-27 10:04:12
Looks ultra dodgy 
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:25:33
If trade coins (I.e BTC to ether) that will also trigger a taxable event in the US.
@_date: 2018-01-30 11:36:20
Should the graphic card manufacturers target meeting the demand?

“Redditor for 3 months”
@_date: 2018-09-25 03:43:40
The price may drop now because of the Riemann Hypothesis news. There will probably be a lot of poor journalism in the next few days 
@_date: 2018-08-15 04:23:26
The end of the FOMO is probably the bottom
@_date: 2018-08-09 12:10:32
Crashing so hard right now!
@_date: 2018-05-31 12:51:03
So bitcoin is crashing again. Good time to buy at 6500
@_date: 2018-08-11 05:16:02
Bottoming out of 6k
@_date: 2018-05-31 13:10:50
@_date: 2019-11-23 09:24:51
The crashining has begun
@_date: 2018-06-15 03:49:40
A research paper is not a “casual link”
@_date: 2018-06-26 06:41:17
More likely to continue sideways movement 
@_date: 2018-06-15 09:07:01
Redditor for 2 weeks - that’s very unlikely. Not with the current distrust of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-24 10:31:33
As I thought yesterday the price would drop below 6k. Insecure exchanges threaten the value of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-23 09:09:29
Below 6k this weekend is a strong possibility
@_date: 2018-06-14 18:20:15
So tether was responsible for the fake value of 2017’s bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-11 09:46:36
Buy in at 6500
@_date: 2018-06-30 06:10:03
It’s not even consistently above 6500 and we already have dudes nutting and talking about bull runs.
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:54:48
Exchanges should be regulated in the respect that their systems and practices should be independently audited
@_date: 2018-06-30 10:53:04
FOMO caused the price increase but it is artificial and will return to sideways movement.
@_date: 2018-06-25 15:32:26
It hasn’t even cleared 6500 for a whole 24 hours, but the bulls are back?
@_date: 2018-06-15 03:45:09
The market is still concerned about the the tether manipulation scandal.
@_date: 2018-06-24 10:33:34
Wow, mature debate.
@_date: 2018-06-16 16:11:20
Crashing hard. “It will never hit 5000”
@_date: 2018-06-30 14:46:28
@_date: 2018-06-29 15:12:27
Bitcoin is struggling to make it back up to its “support”.  Continued sideways movement towards 5k
@_date: 2018-06-15 05:28:23
I feel that this is like arguing with “anti-vaxers” or flat-earthers. They just claim that any evidence is false.
@_date: 2018-06-22 17:31:27
No profit in bitcoin in 2018
@_date: 2018-06-30 11:37:48
“Redditor for 3 months”
@_date: 2018-06-12 17:38:50
Is he ready to start sucking his dick?

Unrealized losses and gains versus actual loses or gains
@_date: 2018-06-12 16:32:28
Unfortunately the average joe/Jane will link bitcoin’s “safety” to the security of exchanges.
@_date: 2018-06-18 05:47:13
The bank of international settlements is fighting bitcoin
@_date: 2018-06-22 10:16:45
Crashing so hard right now
@_date: 2018-06-24 07:54:13
How mature, screenshooting people’s opinions. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 04:42:27
Bitcoin is being smashed because of the insecure exchanges and  the report from the International Bank of Settlements.
@_date: 2019-02-11 04:03:25
Why is important for a currency to have value? Go ask Zimbabwe and Venezuela.
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:37:50
Second straight month of declines. 20 % down 
@_date: 2018-11-25 12:14:14
Holy fuck just checked the price. When is the right time to buy? 2000 ?
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:24:58
That’s what I said. The actual value is less than 9k.
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:17:19
Observations over the last 7 and 30 days. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 10:42:27
It’s seems that bitcoin is struggling to maintain its erection 
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:51:52
Possibly both 
@_date: 2018-03-22 08:41:21
@_date: 2018-03-28 04:29:21
Bitcoin would be an attractive price is it dropped by another 1k
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:10:21
Then why reply :)
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:27:31
Funnily enough your average is the Mt Gox lawyer’s average. 
11k may be the ceiling for months 
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:56:56
166 000 BTC
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:28:21
@_date: 2018-11-15 17:55:22
5000 is the new 6000
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:29:11
Yes, Reddit has an API that can be used for data extraction.
The hard part would be processing the unstructured comments. But there are natural language processing algorithms and machine learning. 
Each comment is time stamped and the bitcoin price data is also publicly available.
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:37:17
Depends, how much bitcoin do you own?
@_date: 2018-03-04 09:40:34
There’s only 1 reason why someone sell mining equipment. It’s making a loss.
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:13:59
It most likely will be 9600 tomorrow at some point in the day. It was like that today.
@_date: 2018-03-27 11:43:59
Bet he has taken it in the ass more than 5 times.
@_date: 2018-03-28 15:53:19
WTF is “block chain”?
@_date: 2018-03-29 11:57:27
Reddit no longer accepts bitcoin as a payment method. This could be another contributing factor to lower value.
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:08:16
Never, look at each price while driving. Up or down could cause you to  rear and another car lol
@_date: 2018-03-13 11:45:33
Maybe for a short pump but the real value of bitcoin is slipping to around 8k
@_date: 2018-03-13 08:42:42
More proof that bitcoin is trending to 8k instead of 10k
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:23:43
When you invested more than you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2018-03-15 11:52:15
Sorry should have ended it with /s
@_date: 2018-03-14 03:04:24
Bitcoin is trending towards 8k with the upper limit shrinking. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 06:59:33
Strong pump before the Sunday sell
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:08:02
No it’s just triangles 
@_date: 2018-03-07 13:29:39
What is not true?
@_date: 2018-11-20 03:00:57
People said it wouldn’t break 5k. 5k is the new 6k
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:40:33
Look at the price 
@_date: 2018-03-27 03:14:10
Sure, “redditor for 3 weeks”: such a compelling list of reasons that you have provided.
@_date: 2018-03-11 17:58:00
As soon as it starts going above 11 k
@_date: 2018-03-02 16:15:31
Or go down to 9.5k
@_date: 2018-03-12 04:06:12
Sure, but won’t stay above 10k all the time 
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:16:52
“A lot of bitcoins” is an understatement 
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:45:04
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:05:04
Bitcoin lost another 300 usd, as I was driving.
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:56:18
They should rather pay the bounty in BTC
@_date: 2018-03-18 07:03:55
The sideways movement’s upper limit is shrinking 
@_date: 2018-03-30 07:09:41
Nice cheap coin available this weekend 
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:52:30
People hate hearing bad predictions 
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:02:43
Mm nice slutty coin- going for cheap 
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:13:24
At what price did you buy at?
@_date: 2018-03-18 10:51:01
It was probably not a pump. More likely people spending the last of their free cash on the cheap coin
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:32:59
The market values bitcoin between 8 and 9 k
@_date: 2018-03-02 04:41:42
@_date: 2018-03-12 11:41:51
That’s probably what they said about the USD too.
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:27:33
Or you could end up being a bag holder 
@_date: 2018-03-08 04:48:48
No, buy high and sell low
@_date: 2018-03-12 04:08:56
Does anyone here? It’s my opinion.
@_date: 2018-03-06 04:53:07
Yeah horizontal movement 
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:01:35
You could make quite a bit of profit with this pattern. Until everyone starts doing it 
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:56:37
You can’t see any buy orders on your exchange? 
@_date: 2018-03-20 04:26:03
Already the price is going up after the first day of  G20
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:16:42
Only if you have invested more than you can afford
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:55:50
@_date: 2018-02-10 09:23:22
Not really, I just want to lower my average before we go to the moon
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:58:50
Perhaps bitcoin is worth 9000 according the current market
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:42:03
This Zaif news is hitting the price quite hard. Expect 9500 by morning 
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:37:13
Don’t buy just yet. You don’t want to catch a falling knife 
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:49:43
Because they bought low
@_date: 2018-02-10 06:44:08
That moment when it skyrockets and you haven’t put enough in
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:58:07
You need to go back and track all your taxable events. Then record a profit/loss for each event. Add them all up and pay tax on your gains.
Taxable events:
Convert BTC to FIAT
Convert BTC to another crypto
@_date: 2018-03-27 03:23:56
Then get a job 
@_date: 2018-03-01 04:40:07
Court order
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:01:41
It’s already touched 8.5k
@_date: 2018-03-17 10:22:11
The price is waiting for G20 news
@_date: 2018-03-07 04:31:24
Because it didn’t go down in less than an hour?
@_date: 2018-03-10 18:18:39
Both 
@_date: 2018-03-01 12:30:10
The triangles show a downward trend
@_date: 2018-03-07 12:14:22
The North Korean mining and use of bitcoin could have a huge impact on the price
@_date: 2018-02-16 04:59:02
Well one of the reasons why 30% of jobs will vanish in 15 years is because “bots” don’t get tired.
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:14:29
Go read this post’s : “suggested topics”. Discussing the price is one of the purposes of daily post.
@_date: 2018-03-11 15:34:30
Or starts 
@_date: 2018-03-13 10:01:42
Daily pump is starting. Get ready to sell at 9600
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:44:52
The falling knife
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:21:46
Why are you on Reddit then lol
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:21:46
Less than 300 to go before bitcoin is, at its actual value deemed by the market.
@_date: 2018-03-09 14:49:38
Whatever redditor for a week
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:14:46
When there is more demand than supply
@_date: 2018-03-30 11:35:59
Crashing beautifully today 
@_date: 2018-03-13 11:46:56
You are programming your bot to sell low and buy high?
@_date: 2018-03-12 04:48:27
Robert is pretty annoying on his stance that bitcoin is mainly used for criminal transactions. 
Far more criminal transactions take place in FIAT
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:35:58
This! People want to believe that it is trending towards 10k but the pattern is the actual reality.
@_date: 2018-03-08 07:42:01
Not good news to those money laundering 
@_date: 2018-02-22 05:00:18
And it’s going to be nuclear powered
@_date: 2018-03-23 05:12:54
The CP allegations and Binance news seem to be hitting the price hard 
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:27:26
More likely to drop more over the weekend 
@_date: 2018-03-07 04:36:34
Look at the 1 week chart. It was pumped and now it’s dropping
@_date: 2018-03-24 07:35:56
Apparently it’s designed for paying freelancers 
@_date: 2018-03-01 04:11:28
13000 coinbase customer records have been handed over to the IRS.
Expect price drops.
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:36:04
Dollar cost average 
@_date: 2018-02-05 05:18:50
And buy again when it hits 5000
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:55:22
It’s dropping nicely, going to be a good price soon.
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:23:28
Sell high and buy low
@_date: 2018-03-15 17:44:45
Nice call back, lol!
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:58:47
Yeah, you go red candle
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:56:05
Well that’s how trading works. Bitcoin can be a stock or a store of value.
@_date: 2018-03-07 03:39:07
Below 10 k on its way
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:05:41
This reminds me of that SEC meeting drop. People sold off right before the meeting but then the meeting was positive and price went up again.
The price will probably go up during or after the G20 meeting.
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:27:59
Don’t buy more than you can afford
@_date: 2018-03-12 04:46:07
We should rather work out the cost in China. I doubt USA is anywhere near China in mining.
@_date: 2018-03-07 03:34:16
Haha, “hardware wallets” are better
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:49:30
Or maybe they lost data
@_date: 2018-02-10 10:17:40
Please drop around the 23rd
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:27:13
It’s dropping hard. Straight down to 8k
@_date: 2018-03-10 08:59:05
What would be the purpose of that? What’s so special about those bitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 03:22:44
Never selling is also terrible advice.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:51:41
It’s going down beautifully. The hard part is waiting to buy at the right point
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:58:30
That’s why the HODL mantra was created. So not everyone does it. Some make profit while others are bag holders.
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:59:06
This looks more like FOMO than a genuine recovery 
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:34:06
Bitcoin took its viagra 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:25:07
It’s crashing really nicely. Need to set an order for  when it hits 7k

Goldman Sachs were implicit in the 2008, financial crisis
@_date: 2018-03-14 03:08:52
Why does he look like a pedophile?
@_date: 2018-03-15 10:48:23
Going back down to below 8k
@_date: 2018-03-23 12:01:24
Unlikely 
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:15:49
A curried dick 
@_date: 2018-03-14 09:26:27
8k soon
@_date: 2018-03-17 10:56:46
No, we want our lambos 
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:54:38
Yeah the recent tax bills changed crypto to be seen as “real property”. Like-Kind rules no longer apply.
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:42:36
I said earlier that the price would drop below 10 k
@_date: 2018-03-12 14:56:03
Yup, only 400 to go
@_date: 2018-03-14 10:28:59
Bitcoin continues to show that it is trending to 8k instead of 10k
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:30:04
Weekend dip starting?
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:19:02
Those are probably the same people defaulting on their credit card payments.
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:38:44
That’s generally when everyone gets excited to sell. They’re scared of the big dump of 12 k
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:55:56
Well currently we are losing 1k a day. So yeah that’s possible.
@_date: 2018-02-14 05:24:53
If you can anything then you pay tax on it.
@_date: 2018-02-26 11:36:46
Will be worth $1000 000 in 2020
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:04:20
No one seriously mines bitcoin anymore with GPUs . Alt coins can still be mined with those.
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:01:18
Bitcoin is trending towards 8k and not 10k
@_date: 2018-02-13 05:12:32
When is the next drop, I want some cheap coins 
@_date: 2018-02-16 05:05:32
What will $1000,000 be worth in the future? 
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:06:07
Encyclopedia 
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:44:44
FOMO walls
@_date: 2018-03-05 04:56:42
Yeah the growth is sideways at the moment. It’s not going up by much.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:13:02
I was referring to the OP’s comment about losing $2300.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:48:00
The SEC news is not even out yet.
@_date: 2018-02-27 04:40:28
Not looking good. We may have to settle for the ISS
@_date: 2018-03-10 12:40:17
Lol sure : “redditor for 1 week”
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:47:18
Going straight down to 8.5 k
@_date: 2018-02-10 06:53:11
Come into the trap, we have candy 
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:14:46
Simple Example:
You buy bitcoin at 8000.
A few days later you buy bitcoin at 6000
The cost of your bitcoin is now 7000
@_date: 2018-03-26 04:22:25
If the price gets that low then it would be an indication of abandoned technology and it wouldn’t get ever close to a 100k coin.
@_date: 2018-02-14 11:32:46
No Lambos for FODLers
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:15:35
That’s how I see it.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:16:55
Cheap coins tomorrow
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:27:08
Your cheeks got busted 
@_date: 2018-02-28 11:39:35
Pushing back down to 9k

What’s the alternative if you have FIAT to spend?
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:58:37
Dollar cost average. As long as your portfolio’s overall cost drops then you are winning:
Unless you are a day trader, then buy low and sell higher.
@_date: 2018-02-09 04:21:29
Their cheeks got busted. NASA is totally reliant now on SpaceX
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:36:43
Yeah hold that bag
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:07:49
You missed his point. Research dollar cost averaging. It works regardless of your input currency 
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:01:59
Nice FUD mate
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:08:23
Or could drop by another 50 % and we buy it for $5k
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:29:12
What was bitcoin worth in February 2017?
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:34:34
I’m talking more about the general pattern. If you look at the chart over the last 30 days.
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:46:42
Those sweet sugar walls
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:28:22
The second point is pretty interesting 
@_date: 2018-03-15 11:51:07
They no longer accept it. Bitcoin is only worth bus tickets now 
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:05:23
No news is bad news
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:29:10
Buy in a smaller amount then 
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:03:54
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:53:55
Trending towards 10k
@_date: 2018-03-12 03:27:47
I see it now. OP’s title obfuscates it 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:21:21
Wow I was expecting your account to be one day old with a shit post like that.
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:30:08
They will and then they’ll introduce the curry coin
@_date: 2018-03-10 09:35:21
The price is closer to 8k than 10k
@_date: 2018-03-11 15:35:00
Yeah, the market does not value bitcoin at 10 K
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:26:00
Bitcoin is definitely crashing
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:44:21
Zaif coin give away
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:47:05
I’m ready to buy and fix my average cost.
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:42:45
It’s already less than 8100
@_date: 2018-03-16 03:19:20
The price is waiting in anticipation of the 19th
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:10:37
Don’t buy now 
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:11:46
Yes you can with GDPR rules.
@_date: 2018-02-17 06:59:32
FOMO just hit
@_date: 2018-02-18 07:09:07
Most likely. It won’t just go up and up without people cashing out 
@_date: 2018-03-15 08:39:20
But it can be worth a whole lot less
@_date: 2018-02-16 12:14:53
I brought up pump and dump yesterday. People didn’t want to believe
@_date: 2018-02-10 09:44:44
Haha, these redditor for 3 days accounts.
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:55:30
Saw this coming and put more FIAT in my exchange 
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:04:58
People could pull their money out of risky investments and move them to more boring and stable ones.
@_date: 2018-03-14 03:23:15
Your last paragraph basically. Bitcoin is in a sideways movement but the peaks are shrinking. For how long is uncertain. The G20 could have a positive or negative effect. 
Bitcoin is in the media, which is also good.
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:46:12
Nope, the price is at equilibrium between 8500 at 11500. But the upper limit is shrinking.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:01:12
So your solution is to regulate bitcoin and censor it?
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:36:29
No it’s gonna keep going down to the new floor
@_date: 2018-02-16 04:55:50

@_date: 2018-02-05 04:44:39
Dropping again. Will be below 8000 in the next hour

@_date: 2018-02-07 04:53:30
This must be a troll question...
@_date: 2018-03-22 09:03:43
If it is true then it would be really bad for bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:36:11
Bitcoin is behaving like a slutcoin now. Sleeping with you on the first date.

Can’t make it back up to 9k anymore
@_date: 2018-03-14 10:53:33
Bitcoin continues its trend towards 8k instead of the hopeful 10k.
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:58:54
Below 9k, now the price will start stabilizing 
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:21:12
Below 10 k is hardly a bull trap
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:23:55
Just buy at 4K then 
@_date: 2018-03-10 10:33:17

@_date: 2018-02-06 04:02:21
Yeah makes it hard to know when to buy
@_date: 2018-03-23 05:22:19
You can’t put a price on keeping your seal intact.
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:20:50
More likely to drop below 8K

You don’t pay taxes by owning bitcoin.
You may need pay taxes when
1. Trading bitcoin for FiAT (USD)
2. Trading for other coins like Ethereum
No you can’t evade taxes. Look at Al Capone, Wesley Snipes.
Just pay your taxes, so your cheeks don’t get busted 
@_date: 2018-02-10 09:52:17

Or the market has decided the actual value of bitcoin is around 8 - 9 k
@_date: 2018-03-11 15:59:47
You should bought earlier. It was already at 8700 k
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:06:25
People should have gotten their money out when it was above 10k

@_date: 2018-02-07 03:29:39
So posting FUD could lend to prosecution 
@_date: 2018-02-07 03:21:12
Love that meme 
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:25:03
It’s just people buying on the dip. Still lots of uncertainties 
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:13:45
Yeah gotta trust news from that domain name ccn,com
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:02:39
All the people selling

Bitcoin heading for 9.5 K
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:27:45
Broken the 7200 wall. 200 to go
@_date: 2018-02-09 11:15:53
Get your coins out, as soon as you can. If they can’t get maintenance right then should you trust that they are secure?
@_date: 2018-03-11 17:48:13
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:41:23
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:07:01
Trade it out before they realize their mistake
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:11:41
Bitcoins cheeks are gonna get busted 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:38:55
And they can no longer sit down comfortably 
@_date: 2018-02-13 11:42:15
Using the word “technical”  does not  magically turn it into science
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:37:17
They don’t like it because it lacks chilli
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:02:42
What’s wrong with a huge rise?
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:22:44
9.5 k today
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:10:02
It’s crashing so nicely. Keep going red candle

Each time you cash out remember the tax implications 
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:41:25
Then people would be buying whole coins 
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:53:46
It’s all relative but it’s already dropped over 10 %
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:29:19
There is no real price. The market decides the price.
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:12:35
Those people don’t own lambos
@_date: 2018-02-07 05:04:38
Yup sure, the value of bitcoin is decided bu the market. It could be worth 1k or 100k
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:55:32
Back to 8k! FeelsGudMan
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:28:15
Yeah we need to encourage people to sell 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:53:02
It’s crashing beautifully 
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:43:33
Thanks for your sacrifice. You made the coin cheaper for the rest of us
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:07:23
8k defense is down 
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:47:01
We would have a lot more to worry about than just bitcoin. Cryptography would basically be broken. All communications would be insecure.
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:25:31
You get a Lambo
You get a Lambo
We all get Lambos!
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:10:49
Your cheeks are going to get busted by the IRS
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:12:15
Yes of course, I realize that. Part of my job is planning changes to Production systems.
 
I question why their maintenance window was so long.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:35:25
As long as you don’t mind dealing with the tax events 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:06:09
Yeah baby!
@_date: 2018-02-07 05:02:39
Everyone is holding.
@_date: 2018-02-26 04:27:49
Red candles again. Can it break 9500 k
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:14:59
Yes he wants to H O D L
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:15:19
Shame you should have wait until it was back to 7k
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:00:19
Because of the Japanese exchange Zaif. Bitcoin was given away for free by accident.
@_date: 2018-02-04 08:57:56
Isn’t going to be even cheaper when tether collapses?
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:14:00
Why a minimum of 9. You don’t sound like a very good CEH
@_date: 2018-03-18 10:54:08
This is the sell off before the G20
@_date: 2018-03-13 04:33:26
What? Did they not test this? Oh well this will make bitcoin nice and cheap for a while.
@_date: 2018-03-15 16:51:03
Thanks for making us richer 
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:55:30
It popped over a month ago 
@_date: 2018-02-08 08:22:52
Yeah let him get his cheeks busted 
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:35:12
Get your coins out, as soon as you can
@_date: 2018-02-10 09:34:21
Why would we give away that information, if we knew?
@_date: 2018-03-12 14:47:53
That mini pump before that 8k dump 
@_date: 2018-03-16 07:07:32
Come on bitcoin hit my buy order. Stop teasing
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:07:32
All those people who sold... lol

Bitcoin continues the downward trend in 2018. Sideways movement is going to chase away many 10X investors
@_date: 2018-03-12 04:29:27
Yup and it was hovering even higher yesterday. So let’s see
@_date: 2018-02-09 11:13:30
Get your coins out now. Don’t support an incompetent company.
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:55:29
Too many guys jizzed all over BitCoin, so now it’s really cheap.
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:21:57
It’s not legal tender in many countries. So legislators need to change law. Right now it is classified as property. Hence the reason for capital gains tax.
If governments can make revenue from the taxes then there is less incentive to classify it as a currency.
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:49:20
There’s a famous bitcoin story about a 19 year old who made $1M from bitcoin. Anyone can buy into it and be successful.
Any good advisor will recommended diversifying your portfolio. In other words, don’t invest everything into one thing.
You can buy any amount of crypto. Start small and keep buying the dips. Hold onto coins until the meet your investment expectations.
Also, research the tax implications of your investment and make sure you keep a comprehensive logs of everything.
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:13:23
Really? Looks more like an equilibrium. Up and down forces matching each other
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:49:59

Coin tracker is a really nice portfolio app. It had a gains/loss report that calculates your dollar average. Great for working out when you can sell.
@_date: 2018-03-07 05:48:18
Massive drops in bitcoin internet searches. Suggesting that people have lost interest.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:03:18
Hope it drops to 5 again

It’s wrong to label and shun the bag holders.
@_date: 2018-07-02 03:39:14
Well OP did say every 2nd year. So 2018 isn’t a year for growth. Technically OP can still be right lol
@_date: 2018-02-15 06:13:09
Buy the dip not the run
@_date: 2018-07-06 15:16:44
Not always. Investment reports are generally issued per quarter.
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:49:11
You should sell now. Buy high and sell low
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:57:49
The lambos and crypto-girls
@_date: 2018-07-10 16:48:08
Nope. 5 k is more likely
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:30:28
How does the IRS tax people? On BTC gains in value or when they perform conversions? 
That 2300 is not lost until it’s converted back to FIAT

@_date: 2018-07-02 05:40:43
And so starts the downward sideways trend. Slowly bleeding out.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:30:27
Great response
@_date: 2018-07-05 05:51:13
The trend shows that the price is slowly bleeding out to 5k.

@_date: 2018-02-02 09:23:04
I thought rockets only went up?
@_date: 2018-02-16 04:13:17
You still have to pay taxes. That’s just tax evasion.

@_date: 2018-07-02 18:20:28
Goes up by 5 % and people forget that it went down by 20 % in June.
@_date: 2018-04-03 05:12:09
It hasn’t even gone above 8000. What price point would you consider being the moon? What is the timeframe?
@_date: 2018-04-01 09:20:23
Miners want lambos they don’t care about your games.

People getting all excited for 7400k. Claiming moon etc. 
Gosh : “Do you even bitcoin?”
@_date: 2018-04-06 03:56:34
Those are unrealized loses. You only lose original FIAT money when you sell your BTC.

Bullshit. It’s just a copy of PayPal. It’s owned by a company and not decentralized like Bitcoin:
@_date: 2018-04-07 06:24:28
The pumps are so short now because bitcoin has erectile disfunction. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:34:34
Depends on the country. Some countries are less than 2000 USD and other countries like South Korea are as high as 26000 USD
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:49:32
Can’t wait for the “whale manipulation” posts
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:37:09
That is not a thing anymore
@_date: 2018-04-03 17:11:18
So you’re just talking crap then 
@_date: 2018-04-05 02:58:30
A whole bunch of tax knowledge. Bitcoin isn’t considered legal tender in many countries. So there are tax implications for accepting an asset as payment.
@_date: 2018-04-06 03:19:05
It could also be replaced by something else and be worth 0 USD

Dollar cost average. Don’t blow your load all at one price point.

Depends on which country.
In USA, you are also liable for gains when trading between other coins.
@_date: 2018-04-04 10:04:47
So it was “mooning” at 7400. What do you say now?

We are still in the Visionary phase. We have not moved to the Pragmatic phase yet.
Bitcoin is still too difficult to use to be widely adopted. Once it’s easy to use then it may be worth 100k
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:20:25
A whole bunch of excited mooners when the price went to 7400
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:29:22
