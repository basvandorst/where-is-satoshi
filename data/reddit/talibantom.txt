That's fucking beautiful. *sheds tear*
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:50:07
Lower. My buy is at 3600 to which I'm sure it's going to correct to by mid this week. Wayyyyyyyyyyy overbought rn.
@_date: 2017-08-11 15:07:33
Lol ok 
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:23:17
Well, I've diversified when everyone panicked and sold their BCH. I still hold BTC but ive dumped most of it for BCH. Don't get me wrong, both sides to the story are compelling, but I personally *prefer* big blocks. So far I've made a nice return. I don't think we can push aside BCH as "just another alt coin"
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:17:58
Use a smart contract
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:25:05
Edited. I meant profitability. That was obvious wasn't it? Guess not.
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:45:24
My god...
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:50:15
I've not shifted everything just yet. After the 2x issue and the difficulty change, I'm gonna invest in either side depending on the outcome. We will see. Either way it's a win for bitcoin as a whole so I'm happy.
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:38:45
Held, holding. I beleive that BCH is operating on the right track, staying true to Satoshis white paper. I do indeed believe that it will soon have more more hashrate if prices continue this trend and the new difficulty kicks in. I'm not biased against BTC but I don't like the off chain solutions segwit offers.
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:23:39
He is trolling you.. keep that thing safe, don't do what he said.
@_date: 2017-08-10 06:58:40
Very very nice explanation. I liked this
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:28:58
Edited again. Jeez. Relax.
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:06:15
No too easy to do a chargeback 
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:00:38
Sure pay me.
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:34:46
That's dollars I'm sure. 300k BTC? You're saying he had more bitcoins on an exchange than the vinklevii? Than ver?  1/3 of satoshis holdings? It's not 300k BTC..

@_date: 2017-08-18 02:00:53
@_date: 2017-08-11 22:47:29
It's going to dip once it hits 3800-4000. By dip I mean 500-600 dollars tops though.
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:12:43
Nope, 
It was at parity an hour ago :)
@_date: 2017-08-17 03:20:28
They bought 150,000 coins not 1.5m coins
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:04:39
7% means by a factor of 1.07. Jihan also tweeted that ant pool will start to mine BCC if they see support.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:16:39
lol don't do this. Worst time to buy rn. Wait. Patience.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:04:30
Me. I sold thinking I spotted a correct Elliot wave. Was a bogus wave.. however I just sold about 0.5, and bought ETH. I still hold the majority of my stash
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:44:26
Lol. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 23:49:07
How much you want, and what premium is acceptable to you?
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:19:24
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:57:21
What? Huh. Don't mind me. I'm just a guy tryna make a record of my bad trades
@_date: 2017-05-09 19:45:04
Thank you 
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:07:30
I have not experienced maintence ever. First time in 4 months of using it.
@_date: 2017-07-19 17:17:51
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:32:58
The "good time" to buy was when it hovered around 2100. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 07:55:37
Its large to me. Maybe not to yourself.
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:17:37
Strap the fuck UP. Don't speak while you're in a rocket ship my friend.
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:53:42
I'm not an expert but BCC is closer to satoshis initial white paper than BTC with segwit. If you'd read the white paper I think you might agree
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:41:29
Currently, for me personally at my electricity cost. ETH Ana d zcash. Depends on hashpower and cost per kwh 
@_date: 2017-07-24 23:51:49
Use either Jm Bullion to buy gold directly with BTC instead of through fiat, or go in small amounts. I've found that 5-6k at a time doesn't cause any problems.
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:32:07
Please don't listen to these guys in the comments. If you feel the price is low, buy. If you feel it will go lower, wait. Do not listen to anyone claiming that mining will be profitable. It isn't with BTC. You're better off mining alt coins.
@_date: 2017-07-22 19:34:26
Euphemism for begging? Get out of here.
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:20:39
No my dude, we just blacked out from 10 G forces. We are slowly resuming consciousness. Strap up you cunt.
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:17:13
Satoshi himself proposed a scaling solution to BTC increasing block size. It seems ironic that his solution is labeled as not the "true BTC" 
@_date: 2017-07-17 02:43:21
I'll buy for you at 5% markup
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:24:41
Memes prepared. Let's ride this one to the moon fellas.
