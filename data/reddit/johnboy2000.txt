So - what's the risk then?
Worst case scenario, you've just bought low cost bitcoin you can't unload at the desired price...?
@_date: 2019-06-30 13:38:33
Curious about that myself...
@_date: 2019-06-30 13:41:18
True - but you've still profited
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:21:32
Coinbase pro

Stacks of bitcoin?
As in - why do they prioritize that?
@_date: 2019-04-19 18:34:50
Okay so - is it that simple now?
I have my wallet - I buy bitcoins, open TOR, find a suitable DNM, transfer to sellers wallet address and wait for my package...
Is that it?
Are hours of further tutorial vids necessary?
@_date: 2019-04-19 13:07:46
coinbase - I thought bitcoin was anonymous?
They want everything from my passport number to employers name....
**not sure if serious
@_date: 2019-04-20 16:19:54
Again being a newbie here - I assume the purchase and transfer to a wallet is pretty straight forward?
Just SEPA transfer - input wallet address - that straight forward?
@_date: 2019-04-19 20:20:06
But I thought you said study it more before buying?
I checked an article on deepdotweb about using WSM and, it's seems straight forward enough.
My only real hesitation now is, actually getting the bitcoin from coinbase via a reputable supplier, and not getting stiffed on a DNM - in addition to customs potentially seizing my order.
This is a real concern.
So - am I good to go here?
Is my understanding sufficient to proceed with these matters?
@_date: 2019-04-19 19:07:05
What I'm trying to convey is - do I have a depth of information now, sufficient to complete a purchase from DNM?
Cause - some feedback makes it sounds like it takes significantly more bitcoin management study, to safely and competently complete this process.
@_date: 2019-04-20 16:07:32
I'm only going for small amount to be used to instant purchase.
I was gonna go for Kraken, coinbase or bitcove.ie
@_date: 2019-04-20 05:36:49
What's your purpose for bitcoin then?
Cause from what I understand - the DNM is the primary reason the majority of people use it.
@_date: 2019-04-19 17:16:31
Okay - I think I'm getting my head around this.
I've got my wallet and wallet address via Electrum.
Then I log onto one of the sites you mentioned - and buy bitcoin via SEPA transfer for credit card.Should I use TOR browser whilst doing this?Or is the purchasing of bitcoin okay on chrome?
I receive the bitcoin via my wallet receiver address.
Then - to make a purchase (via a wickr contact), I simply forward the agreed amount onto the sellers wallet address...??
If I was purchasing from a DNM - I would in this case, use TOR however.
Have I nailed the - pertinent effects?
@_date: 2019-04-20 07:57:06
I think it's fairly safe to assume you are in the minority?
@_date: 2019-04-19 16:27:09
There is one in a second hand phone store a couple towns over.
If it's listed on that site - does that mean it's legit for sure?

I use this machine for regular clearnet banking, ebay orders etc.
I have not, since the malware download - logged on or into anything.
Is it possible my day to day information may be compromised at this point - despite not having input any codes/passwords since the download?
@_date: 2019-05-20 12:34:32
Yes - this.... motherfucker - electrumHelper.
He just sent me a DM to a phished site - I'll copy it just now;
@_date: 2019-05-20 09:21:02
Is this a fairly reliable method to ensure malware is now neutralized?
@_date: 2019-05-17 07:57:12
Hardware wallets are kind of pricey, no?
@_date: 2019-05-17 08:05:27
But after the fact - like now - having downloaded and installed;
Anything I can do in terms of damage control?
@_date: 2019-05-20 09:41:04
After getting phished - I am now officially paranoid and super fastidious about every motherfuckin' thing I do on the interwebs.
This is the website??
Free shipping with DHL...??
@_date: 2019-05-17 08:04:34
Any recommendations for a cost efficient one - and cost efficient place to source it?
@_date: 2019-05-17 15:21:53
I changed the passwords using a key scrambler.  
Is that sufficient?  
The first post you made -  backing up, formatting, reinstalling - can you link a guide or something as to how I do that?  
I'm not overly computer savvy.
@_date: 2019-05-20 07:52:11
I formatted and let the computer reinstall - and it reinstalled damn windows 8 somehow - even though I bought the computer with windows 10.
I tried downloading windows 10 - but microsoft website says I have to pay 140 dollards for the privilege?
