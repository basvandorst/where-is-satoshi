I have spoken to a prominent member of the Cambodian Bitcoin community and there is definitely a future for Bitcoin exchanges in this country. We are not going to see large volume in the first few months but we have to start somewhere. Like Africa, overseas remittance is a sore point in this country due to the smaller amounts involved, and Bitcoin can really improve at least this segment of the market.

Microtransactions typically are smaller in bytes then larger amount transactions as they involve a smaller number of inputs (i.e. coins).
The way they worked out the 3 tps neglects this fact, and also neglects the base block size (overhead). 7 tps is closer to the real limit - it is based on 300 bytes per transaction (a typical 1 input 2 output transaction is about 226 bytes).

Particular banks may have bilateral agreements and proprietary payment settlement processes. However, I can tell you from experience (I use these transfer routes via internet banking every month):
* ANZ &lt;-&gt; Westpac: 1-2 days
* ANZ &lt;-&gt; CBA: 1-2 days
* Westpac &lt;-&gt; NAB: 1-2 days
* ANZ &lt;-&gt; NAB: 1-2 days
BPay is also 1-2 days - making is useless for shopping payments as well.
CBA owns and operates about 5 banks (well, fronts/brands is an more accurate description) - so transfers between those may be instant.
Westpac owns and operates about 5 banks (well, fronts/brands is an more accurate description) - so transfers between those may be instant.

There is a transaction fee paid for every transaction - so that part scales linearly (i.e. just fine). When there are 10x more transactions the miners get paid 10x as much - so they are happy to buy more HDDs and network bandwidth even if the price of bitcoin remains the same.

Thats only between accounts of the SAME bank. There are 4 major banks in Australia plus about 10 smaller ones. There is currently on average a 75% chance that a random bank to bank transfer will take 1-2 days - which is useless for shopping payment processing - hence the popularity of EFTPOS (no online capability) and credit cards (chargeback risk).
 "Transfers to most other Australian financial institutions are usually available the next business day."
 "Transfers are processed overnight on bank business days."

I think inopia's math is a bit off:
* 4000 tx per second * 300 bytes per tx = 1200000 bytes = 1200kb per second of tx storage
* 1200kb * 60 seconds = 72mb per minute
* 72mb * 10 minutes = 720mb per 10 minute block
Thats 0.72gb per block, not 5.3122gb !
* 24 * 60 / 10 = 144 blocks per day
* 144 * 720mb = 103680mb = 103gb per day
* 103gb * 365 days = 37595 gb = 37.6TB per year
Each HDD holds 6TB these days, so that is about 6 HDDs a year
By the time Bitcoin gets this much use (10 years?), we will probably have 24TB HDDs, so only a couple will be needed.

No such retrictions with a real exchange like coinsetter.com or cryptsy.com
Part of the reason for limits with Circle and Coinbase is that they are not exchanges, so they have to buy bitcoins to sell to you from an exchange first, hence the limits so that they can serve more customers.
They don't want to keep too many bitcoins on hand due to volatility.

Orphan rates under 8% (2.5 minute block time) do not undermine transaction performance and the orphan rate has nothing to do with needing more confirmations, as demonstrated by Litecoin over the last 3 years. block speed or security.
