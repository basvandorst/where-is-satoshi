Stays in coinbase then you can withdraw to your bank account from there

Buying bitcoin is always going to be a risk but yeah a hack might cause it to drop more so I'll wait and see

I bought previously when it dropped below £7k and sold for £8.5k, hoping to somewhat replicate that

Thanks for the advice

I'll try and buy later today thanks

Kicking myself that I didn't buy couple of days ago, looks like it's only upwards from here. But there's always a high chance of another dip after a whale decides to dump, I'll be waiting...
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:10:03
Wait until £6k
@_date: 2018-03-09 11:24:46
Hopefully it drops more

I think there's still room for it to drop fingers crossed it drops below £7k again then I'll buy, I always have an alert on my phone set up for when Bitcoin reaches a certain price point so I'll know if it drops at all times

Yeah same, I see it going lower I predict below £6.5k. It depends on how much media attention this hack attracts which will determine the severity of the drop.

Good time to buy following the G20 news?
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:12:47
Yep anytime
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:18:06
Looks like I called it ��
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:31:17
Looks like it's settling at £6.7k
