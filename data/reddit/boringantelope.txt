meh it's adoption.
if you are using Robinhood, just know you don't actually own the BTC  (you can't withdraw)- you are just trusting Robinhood that they will remain fair with you.

bitcoin is money, but money can change in value

but when moon  
1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin = 1 lambo

He's been a pretty silent fan of bitcoin for a long time now.  
Looking forward to hear what he'll be speaking about.

I wish more people made proposols on this subreddit, you win for doing that.But my initial thoughts are I disagree - But I think a lot of it comes down to preference/beliefs.Here some thoughts:
\- Making changes in decentralized systems are expensive, this would entail changing all references from "bitcoin" to "bit" in the source code. Safe or not, it's a non-zero amount of risk introduced.I don't like adding risk to money systems.
\- Confusion between versions:Not every node is required to be 100% up to date, adds risk of api changes, etc between versions.
\- Loss of trust of brand names"dollars" AFAIK a meaningless word, but if we changed dollars to "dolls", or "bucks", or w.e we want there is a sense of change, a lot of bitcoin beliefs are in systems that are resiliant to change unless incredibly necessary.  I don't want the currency to change to incentive adoption at any moment, I want the best long term currency. Maybe long names become trendy someday, why? idk.
\- confusion between bit (money) and bits (networks)the word "bits" is already confusing AF
\- bits is a unit already used in bitcoin100 satoshi = 1 bit = 1 microbitcoin = 1 μBTC = 0.000001 **bitcoin** (**BTC**)
\- value of marketingI believe there is far more value to gain by **drastically improving UX**, implementing novel usecases, if the thing holding bitcoin back is the name.. then bitcoin will not survive.
\- language barriers
"bitcoin" is unique, bit is not


Solution for what? Bitcoin's growth has been absolutely incredible...It's a very different evolving community and has grown and changed significantly from \~$10, then \~$200, now 7.5k in like \~8 years.
My proposal:call your money whatever you want, nobody is telling you what to do, build interfaces that call it bits if you prefer that. If people agree then they'll adopt it, but understand consenses is rare and that is by design.I see people referencing "sat" as it's proven to be far more usable day-to-day in the lightning network community
EDited to emphasis improving UX, most bitcoin UX is shit.for people interested in becoming knowledgebale UX field, great way to get porfolio experience is to go to existing projects (*ESPECIALLY LIGHTNING/LND PROJECTS*) and ask if they have any UX needs. Promise you most projects will say yes and would love you to explore UX options and provide ideas! experienced or not, seriously there is a huge UX need in our industry.

it's literally figuratively literal.

You can use my lucky dice! You'll be mining all the blocks.
@_date: 2019-09-09 03:41:02
why not use sats as the base and use SI from there?

\&gt;  Succesful hard fork results in everyone upgrading and one chain continuing
why would it be called a fork then..?
\&gt;  went with a copy of the code and the chain
Yo that's a fork...[ go to the top right and fork it yourself.  
see  [UnsersGottaGo]( response for the correct answer.

fair enough, I guess it's not worth either of our time to care.
@_date: 2019-09-17 04:19:06
yeah, it could also be more restrictive, or it could be the exact same code on a separate network.
A code fork implies you are going to make changes.  
You were saying bcash wasn't a fork.. it certainly was.
