No, don't do that; select or type 'other bank'.  Then go that way.

Que?

I'm very happy for you.  I have a former student in Garanhuns, Pernambuco.  Parabens!

Now get out of Coinbase.  HIgh fees and their exchange rate is pure usury.  
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:24:01
Bittrex, or GDAX.

I did it and so far just fine in that regard.  But stay away from Coinbase for other reasons: high fees, they take forever to transfer funds, and outrageous exchange rate that is pure usury.  Once my funds are transferred I'm moving to Bittrex.

Coinbase is a block of manure

A 'dip' in Bitcoin is rather small
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:04:55
exactly.  Thank you for pointing this out.
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:20:12
What do you mean? What do you think will happen?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:44:06
Stay in Bitcoin, but get out of Coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:53:10
Everyone get out - for God's sake get OUT - of the cathedral of excrement that is Coinbase.  High fees, exchange rate usury, a week to transfer funds that my bank hands over in two days, and even NOW as I write this they're not trading bitcoin.  !

No, it's owned by them but a whole different experience.  Fees very low.
