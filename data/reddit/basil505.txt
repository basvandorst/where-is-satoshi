What’s wrong with bitcoin cash? Why is it bad to support it? This sounds like a witch hunt.

Yep. I f´d up by having my 2FA and BFX password accessible through my gmail.
I am not blaming BFX. Infact, BFX has been quite helpful providing all the information they could.
I need to find out from google how the attacker "passed challenge" to gain access to my gmail, but I can not for the life of me figure out how to do that. How do I get the attention of google security team to provide more insight into this misfortune??
Also, you are an asshole. It was probably you that stole my BTC.

"The report advises that investors buy shares in the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), a vehicle for speculators to invest in bitcoin without actually buying and holding the asset."
Is it obvious that Barry Silbert just bought coindesk? Bit odd this report would advise that investors invest in the bitcoin investment trust (owned by the same company as coindesk).. above all the other types of investments including buying bitcoin itself.... siiiighhh.
I guess it is time to find a new source of bitcoin news... one that doesnt have an agenda....
Shame on you.

How do you invest $20 per week? isnt the wire fee to the exchanges killing you for the frequent small transactions?

I would say you have a decent shot of getting this back.
Most bitcoin thefts are not not recoverable because there are no suspects.  In this case you know who did it so it is just a matter of proving it.
You need to post the transaction IDs so the community can track them on the blockchain.  $90,000USD is a lot of bitcoin to sell on the street.  There is a good chance that the thief used an exchange to convert them to USD.  He would need to have a verified account to withdraw the funds to a bank and those withdrawals would be the smoking gun.  Good luck.
