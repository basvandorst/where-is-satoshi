Everyone knows Bitconnect was a scam and a ponzi. Oh by the way, you do know what makes a ponzi a ponzi right? Because NEXUS Global has 8 products they are promoting, so you may want to research and google to find out what a ponzi really means. And again, you still haven't told me what you know about NEXUS Global that makes it a scam. So please do enlighten... and please show some PROOF of your statement and accusations, that would be real nice :) that way I can personally tell the ceo of Waterwaterdude555's proof on his company. Thank you, I greatly appreciate it :)

That's interesting. How does one know a company is a scam when it hasn't launched yet? And what do you know about NEXUS Global that no one else does? Please enlighten...

WOW!!! Seriously, that's your measure of a scam, because it's an mlm. You obviously have no clue about the mlm industry, that it is $178 Billion global market. Try googling it, I dare ya lol. And you should see the top earners of the industry if you care to educate yourself...  
Me personally, I used to make more than $25,000 a month for one mlm company, and my friends are millionaires in the industry.

This is for those ignorant people who uses the word Ponzi, obviously not knowing its TRUE meaning, and taking away a chance for others to benefit. And to those that just follow them like a sheep, missing out on what could otherwise be HUGE Opportunities... News at six, we'll see who's laughing all the way to the bank hahaha!
