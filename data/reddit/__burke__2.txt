it's 12 bucks each. 
Stop getting caught up on the price, will prob go down when it gets bigger.

It's 3 units for $37.5. I'm fine with $12.5 for anon transactions. The next guy can also give to someone else. This makes it cheap enough.  I'm sure it will come down in price once it gets bigger.

I think you are comparing with wallets.
It's not a wallet, it's a bearer bond.

You must have miss typed. It's not comparable to a online wallet in any sense. 
It's not possible to give a paper wallet with balance to someone and prove that you didn't keep a copy of the key.
Maybe, before coming to so many off the mark conclusions. You should buy it and try it for yourself.

Because he is selling it, he works for AirBitz. OP is looking for user's suggestions.

I prefer **Circle**, they are much better. 
What do you think?

Bitcoin is borderless.

100% shill post by Coinbase.

- Insurance is a centralized, trust based system = It fails all the time.
- Cryptography properly applied = very unlikely to fail.
The whole point of Bitcoin is to NOT have to trust any party.

Didn't you get hacked and lost over 300 BTC??? 
Who would still use this wallet?
@_date: 2014-10-27 18:11:19
Don't use Coinbase or Circle, or your coins will forever be tracked to you.

This post has nothing to do with ChangeTip

If you don't have the keys you don't own the Bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-01-28 15:17:15
I think so, well I have something very similar using coinkite with 3 of 5, but that just preference. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 16:20:53
Ok, so they were incompetent and got hacked. How do we know they haven't screwed up something so fundamental again?

You have a great site, but please don't incentive address re-use.

Great another US org wanting to own an international internet thing. No thanks.
@_date: 2015-03-17 17:15:10
This is awesome

It's not hard, I [export a CSV]( of my transaction history with the memos and send to my accountant. He just treats the BTC as another currency. 
@_date: 2015-10-14 14:23:37
Amazing, this should be on r/all front page!

Seems like a very shitty infomercial product with scare tactics commercial. 
Not even open source.
