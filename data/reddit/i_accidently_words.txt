What you don't understand is that we are incapable of preventing people from getting drugs. Even in maximum security prisons people get ahold of drugs. They aren't providing anything new to these people.

Which ones do you think are unhealthy, and under what circumstances?(even cyanide can be taken at a low enough dose to have no effect)
For the sake of argument, lets assume that all drugs at all doses have some negative side effects. Aside from harming the user who is doing it willingly who does it hurt? Cutters hurt themselves but commit no crime. Who does throwing these people in jail benefit?

Public school blows, as long as the parents find ways for the kid to socialize they are much better off.

Not really, transferring money to bitcoins then to silk road is a pain in the butt. Many things are more expensive. It requires an internet connection and an address to ship to. Much harder that going to a shady neighborhood to get your fix. Its safer though, you won't be robbed, or ripped off. The drugs won't be cut with harmful chemicals so you know what your getting. 
For everyday drug users the site is too much of a hassle and too big a risk. However it does make it easier for somebody to try something new, and for users who don't want to try tracking down a dealer.
I will admit, heroin and crack cocaine are very harmful drugs to those who get addicted however those addicted have a medical problem, and it should not be treated as a crime.
Aside from those(and a few others) the majority of drugs can be used responsibly. In fact i'm willing to bet you know people who do drugs responsibly, so responsibly you'd never know it.

I figured as much, i was going to try to lead him to the conclusion that authority isn't always right.

I think an exceptionally large bit coin tip would be appropriate too, like tipping 20 on a $20 bill. Otherwise the tip you give them is more work that its worth.(not that i wouldn't redeem it if i were them.)

Look man, just because the world you want to exist hasn't existed in our history, that doesn't mean it will happen this time. All our recorded history says that in the absence of a government people will form a new one, and the quality of that government is irrelevant to its short term success.

That's pretty cheep for money laundering.
@_date: 2013-06-04 15:17:41

@_date: 2013-09-22 18:00:39
And why do you feel that way?
