Dude, you must have way to much to notice that stuff. Good catch.

**Important** sidenote with respect to the segment of fiat value vs crypto value.
See 26:41 (Nouriel on central banks debasing fiat currency).
The fact is that fiat currencies lose their value because of a centralized authority (the central banks) debasing the currency **by inflation** (i.e. increasing the supply). The fact is also that crypto currencies lost their value, because of **speculation**, and that 'flaw' isn't systemic. This is human perception at play. In other words, the fiat-system behind the US Dollar also doesn't offer protection against this phenomenon. Sure, the US is less prone to this phenomenon because of it's immense power. But that is also not a valid argument when we want to discus the underlying systems.
When we are talking about fiat vs crypto here, we are talking about the nature and characteristics of both monetary systems. I found it rather disturbing and insanely unfortunate that this distinction wasn't made.
That Nouriel doesn't bring this up is ofcourse not surprising. He is after all biased as a central banker. Whether such people are smart enough to understand this, is something I'll leave in the middle. But their track-record isn't convincing.
Vitalik also didn't make this distinction. He kinda drops the ball here but atleast he rightly points out that: gold is also volatile relative to fiat currencies, and gold is, because of it's characteristics, a much better form of money then fiat. Proven by the fact that, for thousands of years, gold has retained it's value, while thousands (99%) of fiat currencies have gone to zero. The US Dollar won't be any different, it could take 5 years or 100. It'll end the same.
