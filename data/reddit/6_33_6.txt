I think he is essentially referring to the value of the original enforced scarcity of Bitcoin and also the security of the network behind it.  Basically the more cryptos that are created, the more they are considered reprints or extra notes in the system...what's the point of legitimate money if it's just printed at will?  It's basically fiat again at that point.  Totally misunderstood concept mostly by newcomers or shortcomers looking to pick a team to make a buck.
In my opinion he is right about bitcoin, but I think there will still be other winning technologies that will coexist alongside it (and even interact).  BTC is the gold standard or atomic clock of crypto even if simply due to its original properties of legitimacy in the digital sense.  I think that those who understand the full perspective of the market understand the distinction and benefits of BTC vs fiat centralized systems that can print and inflate at will, regardless of how many more cryptos are created.  In fact they may see a pattern.  It doesn't necessarily matter if BTC is at the most leading edge of technology as that will literally change by the month.  Considering all other cryptos are birthed from the creation of BTC (not in code, but release of the working concept) and more and more will continue to be created, this leads to market oversaturation.  That being said, there are plenty of blockchain technologies that have their uses and values!  On the other hand, most other cryptos are too simple and only represent 2 pieces of a 1000 piece puzzle, sold as the "next best thing".  We will also eventually see attacks on weaker networks and it will be interesting to see which ones survive.

If I listened to my dad when BTC was "too high" at $80 I would be really fucking angry at myself right now and probably forever.  Following your gut and living your own life is part of growing up and being an adult.  If I had listened to my (actually very smart, but perhaps pessimistic) father my life would be totally different, and for the worse.  $2k is nothing at your age even when you have 27k in savings...you have a lifetime to make $2k again, it is not an issue.  Tell them what you must, but do what you need to do for yourself.

@_date: 2018-01-24 18:39:08
Basically you are correct in the sense that anything after bitcoin without a separate use function is essentially infinite in supply and worth less because of their "reprinted note" nature.  That being said, there is room for more than one but Bitcoin is THE main one because of its original enforced scarcity.  If everyone leaves bitcoin and we enter an era of endless crypto, then yes there is no point it's the same as fiat.  I don't think that will happen, though, and the enforced scarcity is the exact reason why BTC will remain king.  Many try to essentially make their own money printing machines with newer cryptos but at a certain point it's just endless fiat.

Found the millennial?  I joke, I am on the outskirts myself...but this massive new wave of users is all about "fast money" FASTER.  They don't seem to care about the "legitimacy" (algo backing, finite amount) of a coin as much as they want it instantly with no regard for why certain coins are valued the way they are beyond a simple impression of new tech hype (which will always exist).  It's almost like they have no understanding or perspective of the market.  You talk about being effective but you act like everything must be done immediately, with no loyalty to any tech except that which is newer and faster.  In a year youll be chasing gains switching coins every month with that attitude.  In the future all the coins will intermingle and interact via a larger system.  I'm not sure what the problem or rush is.  Well yes, I do know: money.  Perspective is everything though...all coins will interact seamlessly and quickly in the future.  Its nothing to worry about.  Satoshi warned us about expanding too fast...fucking calm down and remember who your daddy is.

CA is a total shit hole (I said it before Trump coined it, don't get your panties in a bunch), glad I finally moved after being born and raised in Southern California (lived there for over 30 years).  Totally lost any pride I had for that fucked up state.  Regulations, taxes and fees EVERYWHERE.  $800 **minimum** to own an LLC /year too.  One of the highest capital gains tax rates in the USA.  Don't even think about owning land unless you are very well off or are willing to live in a shitty neighborhood or on credit with a large mortgage.  Good luck paying double the price of the rest of the country for an apartment, too.  The people are very unfriendly also, for the most part (it wasn't always like that but there are too many people stomping on each other like a constant Black Friday from hell).  Don't even get me started on traffic and gas prices...I could go on and on...most Californians are just disillusioned frogs sitting in slowly boiling water...it's really bad.  Most of my family are natives and half have moved within the last 5 years.

I can only speak from my own experience.  I use two banks and the local credit union is more BTC friendly than Wells Fargo.  Not all credit unions will be the same but there is more of a likelihood that a credit union will be more BTC friendly than a large bank.

Honestly I'm not trying to stick up for Coinbase but check this out from their blog:  
  


  
The banks are reversing past transactions and re-tagging them so that they know they are digital currency purchases.  People should be mad at the banks and credit card networks.

As for the rest of us, we know how to read and think so don't worry about it.

Can't tell if that's an underhanded way of saying you don't agree with the facts about California or if you really care about the metaphor that much LOL.  Like I said, TIL, thanks.

It's unbelievable how many of you don't understand how this works.  Dude...you have your seed.  Your seed can recover your keys--your keys are derived from it.

Hi yes the sources are down below.  My sources include the official US Census from 2017.  Shit hole is my opinion and you can have your own opinion too, it's okay, we understand.

I find it funny that you think you are being clever with this comment.  You do not have to be a developer to understand bitcoin.  If you know how to read and have the time to think, you should be able to understand it too.  I'm not necessarily a developer but I do have a CS background, which helps but isn't necessary by any means.

I think that eventually most will convert to gold rather than fiat, but that is at least a year away IMO.  Some do it already but as far as a trend, that hasn't quite kicked in YET.

I laugh at people like you...so brainwashed.  You really don't know what you are missing.  This is coming from a native Californian who lived there for over 30 years.  You're only hurting yourself by staying there.  Most of my family has moved in the last 5 years (all natives) and I just made the move as well.  Californians are totally disillusioned like frogs in slowly boiling water.  Especially obvious by your rant vs "dumb ass red states" and "anti-science"...I feel bad for you.  You are so confused that you connect inappropriate concepts and forces to support your imaginary perceptions and projections of other happy and productive people across OUR entire country.  Much of CA does not know they face major social issues, but it is obvious from out of state.  CA has also dropped to the highest ranking state in poverty throughout the whole USA as of last year's US Census.  You can read more about CA's problems that I found obvious while living there, here:
