that's about $4.50.  Maybe I've been on reddit too long but I was expecting that to be tree fiddy

I bought as it was rising, coinbase was taking forever to verify, I was trying to buy at 700, I ended up buying right at the very peak, around 1120 because that was when I was finally verified

First time I saw bitcoin other than online was at a juice bar in the ferry building in San Francisco
@_date: 2014-03-29 15:51:47
Actually no, I was opening an account via coinbase and I had to wait for confirmation, instead of it taking 2-3 days it took a couple weeks.  They didn't recognize my small credit union, and since I was new to this, I didn't want to use my main bank account (a big bank) in case everything went wrong ( wasn't sure if I could trust coinbase at the time, I was new at this)  Nothing happened for so long that the price shot up and I got frustrated and used the  login info for the main bank, which took 2 days and I got my BTC.  I can now use my credit union to buy BTC, but it was a frustratingly long process.  But no, please, call me a liar.  
@_date: 2014-03-29 16:25:27
Neither really, verification took much longer than was expected, and the only way to purchase BTC with any reasonable speed was to hand over my login info which I was wary of, oh well

That's really good to know, but at the moment, I'm very broke, I was going to try to get a very small amount just to see how it goes

I don't understand wanting a mansion, the property taxes would really suck

Holy hell, there are 4 donations of 4+ BTC, I wish I was that clever, he's got more than 25K
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:52:03
Thanks, for something like this, I think I'll stick with something more reputable until I get comfortable with the idea.  Also, I almost made a bad chemistry joke right there
Edit:  Added 1st sentence
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:47:41
I was going to mention that, totally blew my mind when I found out
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:16:10
Rad, I'm a huge nerd with statistics so that'll be really fun to see
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:02:41
Why would you say that?  I used to smoke a pack a day and just couldn't quit, especially when it was a particularly hard day.  Vaping helped me quit, now I use 0 nicotine and only vape when I'm hit with a particularly difficult and stressful situation, like Thanksgiving lol
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:58:10
I have a question about whether or not coinbase keeps track of how much you bought your BTC for like say if I bought 1 a month for the next 2 years, would it keep track of how much I got them for?  Kind of like a ROI type of deal
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:35:31
Hmm I think I misinterpreted this, my bad, next time I'm going to read this a bit more thoroughly before posting
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:42:33
Eh, I don't trust people that much, thanks for the tip though
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:48:47
This is the exact reason I deal with credit unions, they try to not fuck you over
@_date: 2013-12-15 05:17:10
+1 for that, I couldn't handle living in that sort of weather
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:29:31
I'm personally waiting for the bubble to pop, that way I can actually afford to buy in, $840 is a lot for me right now
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:35:00
Throw in Bourbon County Rare, 2+ variants of Dark Lord and I'm in, seriously
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:52:25
Thanks!  I haven't checked out altcoins yet so this is really cool
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:59:59
Cooool, first, I win internets, 2nd, first bitcoin for me, third, that's really nice of you

First thing I thought of when I read Bratislava
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:03:55
ha, yeah, that graph needs to be recharted badly
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:55:09
Yeah that's what a lot of my homebrewing friends have said.  But I like the idea of being able to tweak a batch and have exact results every time.  It also seems like temp control would be much much easier this way.

Tell me about it, I have 0.03 BTC right now lol
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:41:58
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:48:01
The sad thing is I heard about BTC a year ago, and thought the only way to get it was to mine and I don't have a decent computer for something like that
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:49:01
My best piece of advice I've ever received was:  when you run into a substantial sum of money, don't do anything for a year.  Get used to the idea of having it, but not spending it, lots of people do something stupid like buy a sportscar right off the bat.  Take a small percentage out consult a tax pro and a financial advisor.  But don't make any changes to your lifestyle, 30-40k could help a lot to diversify your portfolio.  And like others are saying, pay off any debt
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:27:31
Is there a minimum investment or profit that you would need before having this sort of fine imposed?  Because my account has $0.03, I don't think I should bother with reporting that
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:13:51
I saw someone selling on localbitcoin at $1700 on friday, now that's a premium
@_date: 2013-12-15 07:27:55
such profit

OP, I'd be interested if you could get Three Floyds Dark Lord, Goose Island Bourbon County Proprietors, and Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout on your tour

I remember laughing about bitcoin at $200, now I'm kicking myself
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:36:19
Good for you, however, for other people, they find this to be an easier step for quitting, and it is working for a lot of people.  I'm not implying that it is healthier, but from the research that I've done, and the MSDS sheets in my office it seems to be okay so far.  All I know is, I feel better using E-cigarettes than I do smoking, and I know exactly what is in my liquid, because I make it for myself, I can't say that for cigarettes.
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:02:01
If only I knew that before buying friday lol
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:22:01
lol yeah I panic bought as soon as I was verified at $1200, now that it's dropped I wish I had held on just a little longer, too bad I don't have any more $ to buy right now
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:35:56
Holy shit he threw him off the bridge?!

True I live in SoCal, so it's not quite a solid one, but close

this could be really cool, it makes more sense for newegg than for subway lol
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:59:02
Yeha I saw 77000 and i was like holy shit that's a lot....actually it still kind of is...
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:58:39
I'm of two minds, I was trying to buy it when it was $700, but coinbase took too long and I bought at $1200, I want it to fall so I can buy at a lower price...but I want it to rise so what I have isn't devalued lol
