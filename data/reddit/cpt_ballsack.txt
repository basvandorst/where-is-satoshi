Great gyft.com went to shit and just delete accounts even if you spent thousands with them over the years, egifter seem shady and codes are not instant.

I can not modify the fee paid AFTER the transaction is sent, I now have to spend time this morning contacting support personnel and try to find someone who knows what bitcoin is and hopefully refund me.
If blocks are full then maybe something technical should be done about it.
Why should whether blocks are full or not even enter the equation when paying with bitcoin. What if I was not as computer savvy and this has happened to a "normal" person who heard great things about bitcoin only to realize its all a load of bullshit.
Bitcoin as it is right now seems useless for day to day usage to replace banks, shitpal and card networks :(
@_date: 2016-08-11 16:37:08
The payment processor was Coinify
I did not mention the name in case anyone tries a social engineering hack on them and tries to claim my refund for themselves. You can never be too careful with audience around here
Anyways the merchant finally replied to me :)

Wow really that is your answer?

@_date: 2016-08-11 12:46:09
Unfortunately the payment processor in this case was neither Coinbase or Bitpay

I paid using Mycelium android app on my phone, fee was auto set to "Normal"
$0.07 for a ~ $31 / €27 transaction
I think your reply is a bit ass-holish, I aint a noob and have used bitcoin for years, there is a problem here with bitcoin being used for ecommerce. It should not be this stressful ordering a fecking pizza

[Yes you are missing the point]( starting with the first sentence...


payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main
benefits are lost if

Have an upvote, from the OPs post its obvious he cares more about solidifying gains in USD (lol) that long term viability of bitcoin
He is basically a speculator not a nerd like some of us who have been using and following bitcoin for years.
@_date: 2017-02-04 16:06:57
My last transaction had $5 worth of fees (at current rate), All of my bitcoin transactions had a sum of over 100$ in fees this year so far.
My bank on other hand offers free banking, free debit card, free SEPA transfers and so on.
So do tell me how is Bitcoin meant to become all it was promised to become (I watched bitcoin grow since 2011 only to hit a wall)
And how can you justify a currency which can handle less transactions in a second that I have fingers become more useful for more people (and hence growing the price to the moon, which is all speculators seem to care about)

I bought like 10 of them on  irc (im in first 1000 members there somewhere lol) for like $30 paypal transfer.
Later that year paypal fucked me over and closed account took 6 months to get 6 grand back, oh how i wish i spent it all on bitcoin....

Yep when I came across bitcoin it was like $4 and there that peak to $30 and back down to 4$ lol
Oh how I wish I had a time machine, lost shit loads of coins along the way too.
Got scammed for 10btc by inputs.io too later on
@_date: 2017-02-17 23:23:17


Not all the time, quite often bitcoin orders fulfillment is delayed (even if there is confirms on bitcoin network)

Duh the economic majority of course, who are voting with their wallets lately...
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:49:52
I have been doing transactions similar to this at least once a week going back to 2011, I paid 181.807 sat/B fee which according to  should have put transaction in next two blocks ( 45 mins average ) As anyone can see at time of the post this puts the transaction into the highest band of fees.
Context dozen people paying me 0.001 to 1 in bitcoin per week, In return for using bitcoin and not other payment methods I have out of my pocket given them extra 20% in credit (which i will now have to remove)
By offering 20% bonus on me for using bitcoin I must have introduced thousands of people to bitcoin, to whom i now need to tell that "sorry but this bitcoin bonus has to stop, please consider alternate payment methods"
@_date: 2017-03-16 11:18:39
r/Bitcoin however is where bitcoiners come to talk about Bitcoin
exponentially increasing fees is not a problem you say?

Oh the irony...


Not being able to spend your coins without having to pay insane fees is a form of confiscation
@_date: 2017-03-16 11:30:55
No it does not, stop trying to make it something its not for whatever agenda you have
Thread outlines my scenario, gives facts and my opinion that SOMETHING, anything should be done.
Who knows maybe core devs and/or miners might read this.
edit: tho' seeing how there is heavy downvoting and your own attitude as a mod to this thread...
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:59:20
I dont really care how the problem is solved the whole mudslinging match seen on this reddit is childish. 
All while real bitcoin users are having to consider alternatives
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:36:58
Exactly, its making room for a competitor to come along and be able to offer micro-payments, faster confirms, less fees
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:04:45


That's the problem tho, with exponentially growing fees and confirmation times its getting hard to actually use/spend bitcoin
@_date: 2017-03-25 13:51:42


You be giving voting rights to botnet miners, like in the good days of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:57:19
If my bank sent you a letter saying:
You had 25 transactions in your current business account this week totalling about 400$ here is a bill for 16$ in fees.
How would you feel?
Average transaction size is above 0.005 BTC here to 0.05BTC, with only two addresses having less (0.0008 and 0.0007), i already asked customers to spend at least 0.005 last week but it takes time for people to realise changes
@_date: 2017-03-25 10:14:16
So you propose to form a centralised cartel, sigh ...
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:12:14
Seems like straw splitting to me, all while transaction fees continue to increase and make bitcoin less and less useful day by day
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:59:38
Either/or would kill bitcoin, yet here we are
@_date: 2017-03-24 17:47:05


Having transactions be subjected to extortionate fees and very long confirmation times (both are growing exponentially, I wonder why...) is going to hurt demand, That demand will then switch to either/or centralized solutions or altcoins, which is already happening.
Guess as to what happens to price??
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:17:39
From a technical POV how hard would it be to implement this replay prevention?

Eh no, I sold high and then re bought low
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:19:09
Well I used Bitcoin more or less day to day for 6+ years now
[Lately its pretty much unusable]( with fees and confirmation times growing exponentially 
I never had a reason to look too deeply or use altcoins, but the longer this hoopla continues and the more comfortable I get with using altcoins on day to day, the more I wonder as to why bother with bitcoin at all.
Already had a guy who regularly bought bitcoins from me inquire about alternatives, which was a bit of a shock.
As fees rise users are not pushed on 2nd layer solutions (none exist or are usable) but onto centralized payment systems or altcoins
@_date: 2017-03-25 13:54:39


They used to say that about those who pulled their money out of MtGox when they could, look how that ended up, but since you are a redditor for 10 days you wouldn't know.
@_date: 2017-03-25 08:23:01


Having used bitcoin for 6 years, its not a question of whether there be a profit in long term
But a question of whether my coins would be usable at all.
Congrats guys you managed to destroy this HODLer trust to the core

Doesnt segwit require an "extension" block?
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:25:39
I posted a thread earlier pointing out that bitcoin fees are getting rediculous
As I was afraid it was down voted and I was met with hostility.
So I went ahead and converted 2 BTC to Ethereum, I still have 60 BTC (mostly bought at $4) but if bitcoin becomes less and less useful on day to day I will have to switch. If needed can pay [bitpay invoices using shapeshift](
Over the years i didnt pay much attention to news such as Mt Gox, various hacks, ETF, China
BUT thru all this time the network did what it advertised, relatively quick transactions at low fees, this is no longer the case worryingly 
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:15:34
 Stop trying to ram segwit down everyone throats (even if it kills bitcoin) and concede that there is a serious problem when it comes to transaction limits being hit
@_date: 2017-03-25 12:59:18
The developers are talking on this forum about changing the core bitcoin POW yet increasing the damned blocksize limit is somehow bad
@_date: 2016-06-12 18:16:39
Well i use bitcoin day to day, as for twitter i have no use for it or the time...
@_date: 2017-03-25 09:10:42

You are missing my point (backround: I've been using bitcoin since 2011-2012, have a pile,lost a pile, and last transaction i done sweeping old addresses cost me $5 in fees). If I holdr i be a millionaire now, but then if me and other early adopters didnt actually use bitcoin it wouldnt be where it is today...
Bitcoin was marketed as a currency that allows for more freedom, yet here we are reading about proposal to make bitcoin even less useful in real life.
