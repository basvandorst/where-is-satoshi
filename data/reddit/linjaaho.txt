How many orders have you received till now?

Extra hint 2 published: all the passwords contain only Finnish or English (no mixing of two languages). And there is 3-4 words. Now, this is easy - maybe too easy :-). And the words are not very strange - I believe even every 14-year-old knows them.

Bitcoin and tax? LOL! :)

Note to self, here is some feedback from Twitter:
*  If inet somehow goes down it will be total chaos even today. We already rely on   whether we realize it or not! :)
*  There are probably already more copies of the blockchain than anything on the planet. No banks have that kind of redundancy! :)
 In the event of a major natural disaster trust will be simply be localized. Mesh networks would spring up too. IOUs r fine, etc
@_date: 2013-03-08 15:42:34
Yes, one of the passwords consists of three words on that list!
@_date: 2013-03-10 13:26:10
Two more hacked: passwords are aurinkoaurinkoaurinko (aurinko = the sun in Finnish) and testingtestingtesting. One to go!
@_date: 2013-03-10 19:34:52
The last one is hacked: goatsegoatsegoatse.

That's the main point of my exercise. I want to map, how easily the bitcoins get robbed. The "lorem ipsum..." was hacked in 7 hours (as you can verify with blockchain.info). The others are "safe". **But after telling here that there is some coins to be robbed,** I expect I'll lose them in 24 hours. Please don't let me down :-).
@_date: 2013-03-11 14:27:37
Points for honesty: you charged the same discounted price which Amazon offered for me, and not the list price.
@_date: 2013-03-10 07:44:13
You're right. The password was fuckfuckfuckfuck. Stupid, indeed! :-)
@_date: 2013-03-06 18:00:27
Lol, on the forum:

Ok, to make this go faster, here are some password hints: 
@_date: 2013-03-08 09:07:03
Extra hint 1 added: in the four unhacked passwords, there are no spaces, just words after words. Example: "juicestoryfootball". 
@_date: 2013-03-11 14:00:12
Great, at least your customer support replies very fast :-). About three minutes :-).
@_date: 2013-03-06 09:34:40
Here you can find the addresses:
@_date: 2013-03-06 10:01:13
I used the  brain wallet generator. Therefore, the minimum is 15 characters.

I have a slow and stupid python script for trying the passphrases (based on  ). With it and a single CPU you can try 100000 phrases per minute. If you rewrite it in C and make some basic optimization, I think you will get 100-10000 times of speedup and crack the passwords in 24 hours (or less, if you use GPU or multicore CPU).
@_date: 2013-03-22 05:09:53
Nice to hear!
My plan is to (when I have time) to create more "wow-blingbling" style presentation with mindblowing images and charts. That bullet-style is a little boring, although it is clear.
@_date: 2013-03-10 12:43:33
testingtestingtesting and aurinkoaurinkoaurinko [aurinko = the sun in Finnish - one of the most common "stupid" passwords in Finland, according to media]).
@_date: 2013-03-06 09:41:02
Yes, please take the coin. Even if I denied it, I have no way (nor interest) to sue you :-).
@_date: 2013-03-15 10:03:09
The page is Google translated. The source, Talouselämä, is the most appreciated financial magazine in Finland (and largest financial weekly magazine in the Nordic countries).
@_date: 2013-03-07 21:24:41
* they only contain English and/or Finnish words
* only allowed characters are small letters (a-z) and spaces
* as I said earlier, the minimum length is 15 chars
@_date: 2013-03-06 09:42:34
So "steal" the coin and post the password here.
After about two weeks from this day I'll reveal the passwords for unhacked wallets.
@_date: 2013-03-09 21:49:52
Great! The second one is now hacked! (I'm not telling the password yet - if someone wants to take credit of it)

@_date: 2013-03-10 15:33:35
LOL - but you are right.
@_date: 2013-03-06 14:12:59
Use  - it is fully client side script. The algorithm itself is simple and if you know the basics of programming:  you can make a couple-of-lines script that tries different passwords until the output is one of the addresses I wrote in the original post.

word "testing" is in the Simpsons dictionary. The last one is not in the Simpsons, but it is in English.
@_date: 2013-03-11 09:34:59
The results: 
@_date: 2013-03-06 09:49:15
Well, I do not want to give too much details, but:
* one of them is in Finnish
* the three of them are in English
They are not complex, you will laugh when you see them.
