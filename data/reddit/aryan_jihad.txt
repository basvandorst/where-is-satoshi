Don't do it.
I believe you would make money over the long term, however say you suffer an accident or an unexpected bill arises and you are down on the BTC and the payment date is looming you suddenly fund yourself unable to ride out the short term blips.

A lot of people will suggest investing in stocks as an alternative to buying Bitcoin under a negative interest rate scenario but this is flawed as history has shown and as has also been shown by the recent wave of QE undertaken by Western governments.
Historically people who purchased shares at running yields of 1-2% have had their fingers burned in eschewing market crashes so when interest rates drop to -4%, we could easily see stock yields hit 0.5% or even lower as investors are essentially forced into buying the stock of terrible companies for very high prices.
Just for fun take a look at the Nikkei 225 since its inception to see the effects of financial mismanagement and that the stock market doesn't always bounce back.
It's crucial for the savvy investor to get some Bitcoins now before they become the mainstream alternative to cash and a single Bitcoin becomes worth what a house is in today's money.

I look forward to watching you eat your highly useful gold.

Except in that sort of apocalyptic scenario gold won't be useful anyway. You can't eat gold, use it to grow food or use it to defend yourself from bandits. If we ever get to a stage where it's machete law and the warlords are king, your gold will be worthless compared with assault rifles, seeds and bricks.

He doesn't understand the purpose of Bitcoin. He views it through the lens you'd view an equity where you asses the fundamentals of the business, it's profitability and assets and sees Bitcoin is not a business, but is going up, so he rejects it. Bitcoin isn't trying to be what he is criticising it for not being.

Only because of the endless wars and general military bullying.
