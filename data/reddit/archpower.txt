Here you go! I was just kidding about the $20 though, I have enough to last until payday.

Coinbase is basically one of the only places I can buy BTC and ETH while living in NY. What other exchanges are open that are accepting registration?
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:32:31
I'm looking to buy/sell/trade bit/alt coins.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:42:20
So you're just pissed that you bought high and sold low.
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:39:47
I sold ETH at like 1.50. Don't see me complaining.
@_date: 2018-01-24 03:18:35
I'm not ashamed. I'm broke. Drop some in here if you get it!

I bought 174 etherium for $200. Sold when it hit $250. I try my hardest not to dwell on it.
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:43:01
I tried Binance, but it seems like their registration process wasn't working very well.
Also, their registrations are down.
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:44:48
Oh, sweet! You're the first person to ever send me cryptocurrency, so Much appreciated! 
@_date: 2018-01-20 04:41:02
I tried to transfer $24 and after three days, no confirmations. Cancelled the transfer and lost my money.
@_date: 2018-01-15 16:21:01
Happy Cake Day.  
What do you mean?
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:57:31
I use Fidelity for my 401k. How do I switch my electorate?
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:47:39
If I had more money to invest, I would. I have like $20 for gas left.

People seem to forget what happens in the past. Where there's a large dip, there's a large amount of transactions building walls, pushing the price down. In my belief, it's a large amount of high powered transactions trying to get people to panic and sell, so whales can eat up the cheap BTC before inflating the price back up for an easy profit. In a market that moves 20-30% in a day, this is a dream for those with means.
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:44:40
Jeez. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-08-30 11:21:39
Just one of those and I'd be able to pay off all my debt.
@_date: 2018-08-03 11:22:17
I bought in at 19, 17, 16, 15, 11 and 8. In that order. Still haven't sold.
@_date: 2018-05-02 22:19:40
I thought you meant Don Draper.
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:40:36
This. If the value of BTC goes from .5 to 1.0, alt coin should go from .5 to .25 considering alt coins use BTC and USD as their relative value.

I've been HODLing since 19k, 18k, 16k, 12k, 10k and 7k. AMA
@_date: 2019-10-24 17:29:39
What is it with these super rich people having the worst hair cuts? It's a requirement for the guild or something?
@_date: 2019-10-23 15:19:26
For the life of me, I can't remember what happened last time it mooned.   
  
  
Wait... now I remember. I took out all of my crypto.

Sweet summer child

And yet again, the lower tiers of society are at the whims of those who seek to cheat the game. Sad part is, those cheating the game are doing it to have the thing BTC is trying not to be.
@_date: 2019-06-04 11:55:10
You're right, which is why this doesn't happen in the stock market. This will either spell the end of BTC or make it so unregulated and automated that it'll be pointless for someone like us lower tier humans to even consider trying. Gotta Hodl now and forever and jump ship when you think you've had enough.
@_date: 2019-06-28 03:15:53
Bought at 18k in early 2018, still hodling.
@_date: 2019-06-28 03:16:17
Give it a week. It'll spike to 19k
@_date: 2018-11-28 13:16:52
I gotta unsubscribe from this sub. It's just a cancer nowadays.
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:33:55
The only parts that matter are what price you buy in at, and what price you sell out at.
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:29:25
This was me 2 years ago. True story.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:01:31
A little harsh. Perhaps the post is a bit misguided, but the effort you put forth into your reply wasn't worth it.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:40:54
Rent is the reason I didn't buy back in 2013, all the way to 2017. It's just an excuse for people who suck as saving money, like myself.
@_date: 2018-02-20 13:56:39
I bought in at 15, 13, 12, 11 and 10. Still HODLing
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:32:14
More like an adjustment. 
@_date: 2019-09-19 10:52:59
Rule  as soon as you mention that you bought BTC, it crashes.
@_date: 2018-07-30 10:57:58
£23 for a burger? Talk about a rip-off.
@_date: 2015-10-22 11:39:16
Yeah, but I'm not a NYC resident. I'm in the mountains up north. What damage could we possibly do?
@_date: 2015-10-22 10:49:40
The ease of being able to jump on a stock while watching it realtime is pretty exciting. I don't have hundreds invested in BTC, but Poloniex was pretty easy to understand for a noob like myself.
@_date: 2015-10-22 10:33:36
My hope was to spend a little free time watching the trades, which Poloniex does. Is there any that I can access without needing to worry about my account being frozen?
@_date: 2017-06-08 11:19:05
I day traded $200 worth of BTC for 174 ETH, and then sold it at $250 to pay for rent.
It's worth like $18k now
