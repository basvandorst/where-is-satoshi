The recent change in price between BTC and USD is actually a good thing. Now, people who love USD can carry around even more of it for the same amount of purchasing power.

Not really. The truth is fiat currency is sketchy. Those printing presses are running overtime. Bitcoin doesn't have to be perfect; all it needs to be is more legit than fiat. More people are waking up to the fact that USD is on the way out. So, when rats flee from a sinking ship, its not because they have suddenly acquired a deep interest in swimming.

If you're an American, your portion of the national debt comes to tens of thousands of USD. If the government wants this money from you and you keep it in a bank, they can seize your funds. If you have an encrypted wallet containing BTC, your funds can't be seized unless you relinquish your pass phrase. I prefer the later scenario. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:36:47
Charities and non-profits are currently bound to serve the interests of of their major financial backers. Bitcoin, being an effectively anonymous means to donate, directly threatens the control that major contributors have over the charities and non-profits. This combined with the fact that it's the best currency for accepting micro-donations ever devised, is reason enough for all charities and non-profits to not only accept but encourage Bitcoin donations. 
It's getting to the point where I actually don't trust a charity or non- profit that  doesn't take Bitcoin. Its just too easy to accept. The only reason not to take it is if they have been told by the major contributors not to accept Bitcoin.

Having a math based currency is a complete game changer. One thing we know about human behavior is that power corrupts. Bitcoins fluctuations are based on people's perceptions. Its a constantly changing real world environment. 
Fiat is created, and manipulated by governments and if you study human behavior, you'll find that governments should be the LAST people you would want to control your currency.

I love how the economic 'experts' use such subjective terms like, "store of wealth" and "universally accepted" as being a defining characteristic of a currency. They make an assertion, like, "Bitcoin isn't universally accepted, so it's not currency". This assertion is in no way quantified or defined, just presented as fact. So many bullshit artists in the economic world, and this is WHY we need Bitcoin.

No governments around the world can't regulate Bitcoin at all. They can only try to regulate people. Unless they are successful with a 51% attack, they can't alter the core code at all. 
This is exactly what happened during the early peer to peer music file sharing days. People said, "this will never last. The music industry will sue everyone and the government will shut it down". What happened is, the government quickly found themselves powerless to stop the onslaught of "criminal downloads". 
Do you work the government or does the government work for you? Use Bitcoin in any way that you see fit. If the government calls you a criminal, and they will since they aren't getting their cut, ignore the bastards.

If it's point of purchase sales, set your client up so that people using BTC can pay via device, before they even walk in the door. 
Access the vendors website via device, order and pay, then just pick up your order. On the merchants side, an online order should trigger an action, like a light blinking, so that the cashiers know that an order needs to be filled.
Anyone who thinks BTC is going to work out as a point of purchase payment system needs to realize that the advantage of paying with BTC HAS to be that the customer doesn't wait in line. IF you want to set up a system where there are 3 methods of potential payment, cash, credit card, and BTC AND BTC is the slowest method of payment, FORGET IT! No one wants to wait around. We didn't get into BTC so we can look like dullards waiting in line. The reason and advantage to use BTC is to skip having to wait in line in the first place.

Here's my experience. Three years ago I was helping a friend paint his boat. I fell off some scaffolding and suffered a compound dislocation to my elbow. Several surgeries later, I've incurred more medical costs than I can possibly afford. I probably should have been a good American and sued the boat owner. In all likelyhood, I would have won the case, and my friend would be now bankrupt. 
My medical bills went to collections and I now have no credit. My crime? Walking around without health care coverage that I simply could not afford. 
Not everyone with bad credit got that way by making bad financial decisions. As far as I'm concerned, if a government has no interest in the health and well being of its citizens, FUCK that government and every financial institution that said government uses as a shit- puppet. 
The banks and credit card companies are used by the government to monitor, and control the proletariat masses. If you are born without money in this country, the truth is, you're not born with zero funds. You are born into debt. What did you do to get yourself in debt, nothing, the older generations had a big party and they are determined to stick you with the bill. The banks and credit card companies are there to make sure that status quo is maintained. 
The fact that Bitcoin lacks central control, is the only hope we have.

An economist will tell you in a very matter of fact way that Bitcoin is most definitely NOT a currency. They will furrow their brow to convey absolute certainty. When you ask them why it isn't, they cite "lack of universal acceptance" as being the major reason. When you ask them to define "universal", they can't. You see, by keeping their arguments completely in the realm of the subjective, they can't lose ANY arguement. 
Fortunately for us, Bitcoin is math. It isn't BS backed up by subjective terminology. So, these "financial types" are about to get there asses handed to them for the first time in history. BS has prevailed and served them so well for so long, they actually believe it themselves.

You have a website? If so, create a wallet, post the address on the website. What is the cost implementation? 
The truth is people don't want to understand anything that threatens the status quo. The charity you work for is a business. The major contributor is your CEO. By accepting Bitcoin, the CEO losses control of power. If someday the charity you work for accepts say 80% of its income via anonymous Bitcoin donations, the next biggest named donor really doesn't pull a whole lot of weight does he/she? I suspect that your current number one donor has no interest in Bitcoin and doesn't want to see it implemented. They will be working hard behind the scenes to make sure that the implementing, tracking, and accounting of Bitcoin seems as foreign and bizarre a concept imaginable. It threatens them.

I'm up on my investment. I notice Citi-Group has admitted to being crooks and are paying billions in fines. Looks like BofA is next.

One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. US dollars are used to fund many programs that kill people you don't know, with money you don't really have, for reasons that you don't understand.

1) buy Bitcoin in person from [localBitcoins.com](
2) places coins in encrypted wallet. 
3) when filing taxes, "forget" that you own this wallet. These accidents happen. Especially to older folks. Memory can be fleeting. We all make mistakes and we're doing our best. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:46:32
Yeah, I'm thinking that we should skip waiting in line altogether. We should order and pay via device, and pick up our order. On the merchants side, they should receive the order w/BTC payment This should trigger an event, like a disco ball turns on, and this notifies the baristas that an order has been placed. They then complete the order. 
If BTC confirmations take a long time, we need to be able to order and pay, before we even walk in the door.
@_date: 2014-03-31 21:19:51
Wait for the price to drop, like now, and load up. There are big advantages to buying anonymously. If it costs a bit more, that's okay. This is the most decentralized way to get your BTC. Who's business is it how much BTC you bought? The only correct answer is "nobody's".

By attempting to appease main stream media, governments, and god fearing Christians, we just end up playing into their hands. It's playing into their hands by giving them credibility. 
Bitcoin isn't looking for mass acceptance. The masses can either remain ignorant or get onboard, it's as simple as that. Bitcoin isn't going to be all things for all people. The way people around here were failing apart like cheerleaders on diet pills after the IRS declared BTC property was really sad. A lot of you people need to grow a pair. Stop with the constant seeking of acceptance. Live free or die.
