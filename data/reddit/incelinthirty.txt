Care to explain how?

I don't think it's possible. Fiat money is the result of the infamous debt spiral. With crypto, the economy either heads to reverse inflation or brings every holder aboard by depending on the consensus. None of these sounds like a desirable outcome for the central bank. And even if they convert all the fiat money to crypto, what exactly would they be going to do with these coins? Distribute them to their customers? What would be the basis of the distribution? How'd transactions be validated afterwards? How'd the validators be rewarded? A lot of unanswered questions and I don't think the central bank has all the answers.

Centralized crypto is not crypto.

But the developers knew that with the passing of time hash difficulty level will rise because of the nature of elliptic curve cryptography. Does that mean they knew the mining network will work for peanuts in the future? Spend a huge amount of electricity and CPU power for a flimsy return? When the day finally comes, in 2030 or 2040, when block reward is so small that it doesn't even count, what would be the incentive for mining?

Oh ok, I get it.

So you are saying the increase in price is commensurate to that of hash difficulty? Bitcoin was nearly $20K back in January 2018. Compared to then hash difficulty level has surely risen but the price has fallen significantly. How is that possible if increased hash difficulty implies higher price?
