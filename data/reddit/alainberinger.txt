Pitchfork mob ready and waiting

Get right back in there, man, no regrets!

Here's an idea: when bitcoin hits 20k, take her out to a fine japanese restaurant and propose. Make it simple, heartfelt and memorable. Your girlfriend will understand.

Oh, I see. So Quebec is the place to be for mining farms. But you guys still have maple syrup and beavers in Ontario though, right?
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:32:44
Oh, Canada, the land of cheap hydroelectric energy and cold weather. And maple syrup. And beavers.

Pretty accurate analogy. Well done, OP's wife.

I think the whole point was that the city doesn't have that much money and the city sales tax that already goes to the police department isn't enough. So it would be kinda difficult for them to start a proper mining facility.

Can't load the article. It says "content blocked".

You might be confident enough, but if you don't know where to begin, you're not exactly ready.

I hate that I have to do this, but you should probably learn the difference between 'it's' and 'its' before starting to explain words to other people.

Those fake news stories really do spread like wildfire.

Feedback: let the users decide whether they're delighted or not and, for goodness' sake, don't call it the best. Pushy sales pitches are off-putting.

Not a single day without JPMorgan proclaiming something

Looks like Canada isn't wasting any time. And any excess or wasted resources.
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:31:37
Are we trapped in some sort of time loop? Why do we keep confirming and reconfirming this?

So, you're telling me that the PBOC is not subservient to the ruling Communist Party? Somehow, I find that hard to believe. Would you still deem it a largely autonomous institution even compared to the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank?
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:42:44
Lol. While we're at it: the IRS are asking for more funds to implement the tax reform law, so maybe we should help them too.

Yeah, Maduro is filth. Are we seriously upvoting bitcoin.com now?

At the moment, it's completely deregulated in Tunisia, so it's technically legal. Same goes for a couple of the the other African states.
@_date: 2018-02-12 09:06:19
Lol. I thought that would be the case.

Why is it relevant that he may be pro bitcoin? He took the job and he is supposed to follow orders. It's not like China's central bank is politically independent.
