I'd love to be able to pay for apps and such in the Playstore with bitcoins!

Same here! Especially since the pizza I ordered yesterday via Lieferheld never showed up :(
Edit: Just saw that my favorite Asian restaurant is on the site - there go all my bitcoins!

If I understand it correctly, you as shopowner would be sceptical about accepting physical bitcoins, seeing as you don't know if you can trust the person owning the bitcoin?

My mother has no idea what Bitcoin is or how it works, but she wanted to buy one anyway. Meaning I did all the work for her  and thus am now being blamed for "losing her money" because the price is sinking.

How do they work? The concept of a physical coin for a virtual currency confuses me a bit.

So I'm not going to be able to take one of these coins, go to a place that accepts bitcoins and be like "give me things for this coin"?

Thanks! The paper wallet comparison just gave me that "aha!" moment!

So it's a novelty thing that kind of makes the whole process more complicated that it has to be?

I sold enough of my Bitcoins to get back my original investment. Now I have nothing to lose and can enjoy the ride!

I'm waiting it out and am hoping she'll do the same, until 1BTC=MILLIONS.
Maybe one day my mother will love me! *sobs*

20-year-old female with next to no income. So close.

Would you say it's safer to have a physical coin? 
Knowing me, I'd lose it within 2 hours.
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:11:00
And my mom.

Ah ok, cool! Starting to understand the concept now, thanks!
