Hi, hope all is well. Gonna get my younger kids on board when I pay for this weekend's movie with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-16 22:02:15
oh go ahead and make my tip a 5k bundle!
@_date: 2015-06-16 22:10:02
Thank you so much. Maybe I will pass the tip to the first kid who wants to open a wallet.

Good day! I treasure Tuesdays. Thanks for tipping.

Since receiving my first bits in a tip from you, I have purchased .234 BTC using Libertyx, watched its USD value fall, rise, and fall again on BitSoup, and attempted to buy coffee using Fold. I am hooked! Thank you.

Thanks for the memories!

Thank you pilaf; I did not expect you to duplicate today's tip.
@_date: 2015-05-13 02:59:25
OK, I will remember that! Thanks again.
(Actually stalked John Cleese in the O'Hare airport once a bunch of years ago; he slipped into the VIP lounge, knowing firmly that I would be unable to follow.  I just wanted to say, "You co-wrote Fawlty Towers, right?")

Thank you Kyle. If I can ever get Fold to work with my Mycelium wallet, I am gonna buy some coffee!

Thanks again. I nearly forgot I had commented!

Hi friend, glad to see you back!
@_date: 2015-04-07 21:19:59
Thank you so much! The adventure begins...

Hi AnalyzerX7,
Am I eligible for a tip?
@_date: 2015-04-14 19:42:59
Judgement call?
@_date: 2015-04-16 21:45:01
Hi. Your idea is a great one for wider adoption of BTC for everyday quick purchases; anyone can appreciate 20% off that daily cup or two. Hope your plans to spread out to other merchants is successful quickly.
Keep the discounts significant, and people will love you.
@_date: 2015-04-14 18:16:45
Great idea, with all the accountability trappings. Thanks!

I am catching your feed with the BitSoup app. Happy to learn of the tipping Tuesday. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-03-31 21:52:56
What have I done wrong here?

Charity begins at home! Great idea (and fabulous way to get me to join reddit).
TIA (we are all counting on you)
