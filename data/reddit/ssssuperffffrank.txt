You see their name because they hired a community manager who does PR as his full time job (he als has an assistant of some kind, maybe her full time job too), whereas other companies would hire more engineers.    This is cool though it is really just a part of burning through of 400k of VC cash they got a few months ago. They might get more if they manage to stay visible long enough to pivot from their wallet/directory retail plan to their edge security but-with-blockchain somethingorother plan.

most of the Gox accounts ( &gt;70% according to the leaked docs) were added from Oct 2013 through Dec 2013.  So Gox was full of newbies who heard about it through mainstream media since that's where the Bitcoin price was constantly sourced.  Gox is also the only highly visible, high volume exchange located in a jurisdiction most people assume to be subject to the rule of law with low corruption.   And they had a seal on their website showing they are founding members of the Bitcoin Foundation, which sounds impressive if you haven't been around the Bitcoin universe much and aren't familiar with the enormous bullshit factor that has to be applied to any claim made by any entity before you can trust it. 
A lot of bitcoiners who weren't using Gox indirectly benefited from its existence as the highest visibility exchange with the highest prices, since those prices are what broke Bitcoin into parabolic gains territory and got the attention of a whole new class of Bitcoin users - which is what everyone seems to agree is necessary for Bitcoin to grow.  Everyone, on Gox or not, made money in large part because of Gox.

The trollbox is 90% idiots and mod buttlickers.  It has been overrun by noobs with a few crumbs worth of coin, as evidenced by the fact that every time BTC drops 5-10% a whole swath of them are taken out of the conversation because the combined value of their holdings just got pulled under the $100 USD value threshold for chatting.  
Nobody listens to what the trollbox says, least of all the trollbox trolls themselves.  I don't even think they can be considered 'trolls' at this point, since trolling has to be at least somewhat effective to be worthy of the term. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 08:22:56
Bitcoin took a huge hit from Gox, wtf are you talking about? If you spent less time looking at cocks and more time looking at charts you'd know that prices on Stamp and BTC-e were ~750-800 before MTGox shat the bed.  
Just because the entire Bitcoin economy didn't crash to nothing after Gox doesn't mean the effects are not still being felt, and will continue to be felt for a long time.

It *will* be dismissed as trolling if you don't provide some means of validating that the bet has been put into terms, wagers posted, and that the deal is irrevocable until resolved.  
Plus I'd be careful with this.  Bitcoin is extremely easy to manipulate for short periods of time.  If someome sitting on 100,000 BTC so desired, they could single handed spark a rally (or a selloff) that would last long enough to satisfy (or fail) the value required at the close price of the previous day, if only for a few minutes prior to close. This being a 24h market you will need to define 'market close' also, though I guess this would be when the NYSE bell rings.  
You should require that the average price for the previous 24 hours is over the equivalent value of a single Berkskire Series A share (and of course, require that same proof in both directions - Berkshire share needs to remain above the USD value of 300 BTC for 24 hours before closing as well).

Oh, ok.  So Mt.Gox and Karpeles are off the hook now? Has everyone just collectively agreed to pretend they forgot that the last time this happened with MtGox, Karpeles made good on the missing Bitcoin, and that MtGox has come back from what should have been certain annihilation several times in the past?  Traders can and should expect to face complete losses due to adverse market movements or by being outmaneuvered by more experienced peers.  But the prospect of being flat out lied to and defrauded should not be a significant part of the risk equation in any civilized marketplace.  
Mt.Gox should have been marginalized a long time ago if "everyone" knew they were shady, but they weren't.  **Mt.Gox was a substantial part of the Bitcoin economy because a proportionally substantial contingent of people in that economy supported (and in many highly visible cases, vouched for) their presence here, no matter what they say after the fact.**

Miners aren't reliable either, the priorities and network incentives that govern the race to catch block rewards are different than those to process the most Txs, and Tx's are what the network is for anyway: block rewards are just a kickstarter mechanism that will diminish over time.  Pools do not solve miner centralization, they make it worse because they mask the allocation of mining resources behind a facade of discontinuous consensus.  Big bad Manny the Miner can hide a 51% attack capability easily, by distributing his own hashrate proportionally across multiple pools.  That's not even getting into the issue of whether he controls some of them already from an inside contact (or just owns them himself through proxy or partnership).
A Bitcoin that is centralized based on a feedback loop formed by favoring miner's priorities, which gives them the casting vote in consensus, which favors centralized infrastructure, will result in  little more than a Rube Goldberg re-implementation of Paypal. Such a Bitcoin, decentralized in name only, will never stand a chance against the real Paypal, let alone the dollar itself.

The same can be said for Visa, PayPal, banks, everything.  No counterparty in any relationship can survive crossing some breaking point threshold contingent of its userbase. 
But, this is the critical part.  They can choose their userbase by erecting gateways and barriers to ensure that most of the users they do let in are going to be docile subjects if not co-conspirators themselves.  
Counteracting this by being as inclusive as technically possible, with inclusivity being the  priority that all others must defer to in the event of a conflict, this is why decentralization is a basic design property of Bitcoin to begin with.

It's great for anyone starting a mining operation today, from a clean slate with no old hardware baggage costs to pay down.  
Anyone starting a farm today also gets to pick the spots known to be best for electricity/cooling/connectivity sweet spots.  All that trial and error has been done by previous miners, so new miners get not only faster chips to start with but a jump on profitability because they don't need to make the same mistakes.

Did any of you commenters read the OP's linked article?   He said a lot more than that there are fewer anti-bitcoiners around (i disagree with this, butcoin's gaining users every day and has almost a 2x higher ratio of online active users to total than here, so more of their butthurters are recent and still active).  
He also said that Bitcoin's moving away from idealist extreme views and opening up to the fact that some privacy may need to be traded for security in the terrorist era that we are in. 
The Banks he pointed out, are announcing their own initiatives, but this wording is careful to qualify this in a way i doubt most Bitcoin believers like:

There are a ton of latent assumptions about what a dollar is in this community, and you may or may not agree with all of them.  You're right, a dollar over the internet is more like an actual dollar over the internet, such as whats in your online bank account. The way dollars get issued and the way Bitcoin gets issued are extremely unlike each other though.
To tell a kid that Bitcoin is a like a dollar, but over the internet, is cheating the kid. It's piggybacking off the value the kid may already have for the what the dollar can do, and trying to transfer that value to Bitcoin without explaining (in kid terms)  why Bitcoin deserves it's own value. It's just being lazy and trying to make the kid like something for the wrong reason. Might as well tell the kid that Satoshi is like Santa Claus, over the internet.

You realize you are proving the point of the small block side by saying this, right?    
Block size is about who gets to be a node, thus who gets to have a say in consensus.  Who gets this say is able to tilt the consensus in the favor of their 'side,' concentrating it in the direction of their circumstantial advantages over time, creating conditions for a centralization positive feedback loop. 
Like any game that has an outcome that is strongly biased by players relative advantages in initial conditions (like being able to zerg rush in Starcraft), **it's not important that *eventually* everyone will have fast / unlimited connections, it's important that some will benefit from them *first*, and this advantage is magnified over time**
The fact that a handful of people in a handful of areas can get premium internet speeds (and what about monthly caps??) as an argument for larger blocks is proving the point of the small blocker's argument.  It nudges out anyone who cannot get those speeds or unlimited caps from ever forming a part of a majority consensus, they are now second class members of the network, stuck on SPV nodes or worse.

Small blocks/big blocks hard and soft forks are irrelevant. 
These are just devs arguing about particular ways to carve up how to dole out consensus and to what kind of actors, by rigging the consensus rules to favor one view or another over how Bitcoin is supposed to grow, and give that view the advantage of network weight.
What they don't ever address is the inconvenient question: why is it going to grow?  Who is the next audience for it? Nearly all the hobbyists and cypherpunks and idealists and decentralized system tinkerers are in. These people supply free (and off the books) capital to the system in labor or PR or goodwill, they put in more than they get out.  Great for them and their CVs and personal non-monetary satisfaction and whatever.  
But that is not going to attract the larger group, who will look to get more out than they put in.

You shitbags deserve to be marginalized and you are, so downvote all you want, invite your butthurt friends and bitcoinxt friends to downvote me, bring all you pathetic sockpuppets, you will not win.  Your side is TOAST.  Enjoy seeing me at -8 while your XT  disappears into complete irrelevance.  You LOSE.

You favor a system that happens to suit your circumstances at the expense of others, because fuck them if they happen to be born or moved to the less well connected place, not your problem.  Wow, I am SO surprised.  Your attitude is as un-bitcoin as it can possibly get.  You don't don't belong in Bitcoin, good thing you are getting squeezed out.

They didn't really give up on the stress test though.  They just subcontracted it out the the entire Bitcoin universe...  Read the rest of that post.   
The new plan is much, much more insidious than the old one.  I'm honestly kind of impressed with the game theory judo skills it took to come up with it.

Upvoting for visibility.  I know we hate anything that brings the word "Bitcoin" into a bad light, but this scam needs to be made visible to this community and hopefully bring as much heat on it as possible before too many victims who would otherwise be interested in exploring Bitcoin get burned by this fraud masquerading as a "better" version of it.   
It's been in europe for about a year or so, they got chased out of Hungary, they got investigated in Finland, and now they are "soft launching" in the USA.  I have heard about it from 2 people who both gave money to this shitball scam and tried to tell me how wonderful it was.  I saw the website they have which is chaotic but overall slick enough to confuse the hell out of people who even kinda sorta know how crypto works, and completely bedazzle those who don't.  
I am surprised it took so long for the natural compatibility of MLM mentality and the "become an early adopter and you win"  message of Bitcoin to find a way to be paired.  
PRO TIP:  This scam works because Bitcoin is hard to use!   The whole thing revolves around getting resellers to handhold suckers through the entire process of acquiring OneCoin claiming it is much better than Bitcoin since it is easier to use.   In reality its harder to use by a long shot, it has no working blockchain AFAIK,  and obviously just a hollow shell of a currency to get people to pay $1000, $5000, $15000 for trader "packages"  they can resell to their sucker friends.

This is an interesting point, I hadn't given much thought about why Bitcoin was created to be a p2p form of electronic cash, as opposed to being a p2p form of something else, like credit.  
Or perhaps something altogether new and distinct from the concept of cash, like p2p identity sharing.  Cash may not have been the most ideal model to use as a basis to "p2p-ify" but time will tell.

Technically not quite true, Bitcoin is indeed permissioned. You need to get permission from the majority consensus, and the agreed mechanism (by this consensus) for getting this permission is to mine your way in, or pay someone else to do it for you (buy coins).  
You can't just take coins, or create them, or interfere with their representation on the blockchain on your own terms - you have to play by the rules set by the existing majority which gate access. The fact that these rules are codified, well known, and compliance with them automated does not diminish the fact that they are a means of gaining permission.

One of bitcoin's more dependable use cases is to make people feel smart about something they barely understand, but understand just a tiny bit better than the average person.
This applies to buttcoiners and bitcoiners pretty much equally IMHO. 
@_date: 2015-10-12 08:42:00
Are you just trolling to be an ass or do you truly not understand that Bitcoin's software is an extension of its network, and as such is in many ways not free to customise to individual tastes without severing it from that network? 
"open source nature of the software" has sod all to do with it.  
What do you think this is, someone's slapped together sudoku game?

ShitShape uses cryptsy behind the scenes. This came out by accident in a recent cryptsy glitch which showed what the names of all the top accounts were by 14-day volume.  An account named ShapeShift(some random numbers here) was  at 950+ BTC.

This is supposed to be a somewhat half-joking scenario and talking about what the economic majority of the future wants is guesswork, but there are lots of scenarios that are not much of a stretch to envision leading to this.  It all depends on how powerful the new money is, what their goals are, and how they will broker a change of heart - not in the entire existing Bitcoin economic base, that is unnecessary - but just enough to tilt the scale to their side.   
For example, Bitcoin's distribution cycle will outlive a certain portion of the current economic majority. People get old, lose their coins, get incarcerated, or otherwise become unable to speak or act on behalf of the "weight" they  supposedly have as represented by their holdings.  
The current economic majority is also in large part quite addicted to block rewards and may find the proposal of extending them by rolling off old dead coins "just this once, to fix an old legacy issue from the wild west days" in order to be able to mine new ones that replace them, keeping the 21m cap but extending the time left to mine.  
Get the miners on board with promises of renewed block reward income, get the new money on board by sweetening the pot with short term boost to the scarcity of their own coin holdings (people will rationalize anything that sounds like it will profit them) and you may have a coalition strong enough to deprecate premises that were baked in to the old consensus. 
Cortes didn't have to defeat the entire Aztec empire by himself, he only needed to practise a little political judo with the other local tribes and states to get them on his side just enough to tilt the odds in favor of conquest.   Of course in the end, the rest of the people got punked just as hard as the Aztecs.

You are filling this thread with rubbish, trying to be cryptic and clever without staying on point because your real point is ideologically shit.
BTW there is something called RES you should check out some time, it lets you tag people so in the future you remember what lies at the centre of the circle they are edging their way around.

Evil genius answer:   They will get discarded in a future hardfork event orchestrated by new money that wants to get rid of "dead" coins for reasons.  They'll persuade enough members of the economic majority dominant at that time to go along with it because it will increase their investment  value at the expense of a bunch of people nobody has heard from and who haven't moved their coins in forever.

Pro Tip: People say this as a way to get out of a tiresome argument with over-persistent zealots.  Stupid people, smart people, it's instinct. 
They figure out if they flatter your ego by feigning lack of ability to afford something that you have, that you will drop the subject because you "won" the point, even if it's an irrelevant side point.  
**Try addressing the subject in terms of something they care about, even if you don't, then work your way out from there.  Be understanding and don't press it if people want to change the subject.** 
Maybe they aren't willing or don't have time to dive into a big ass mental space trip about the meaning of money right then and there.   
Don't feel the need to close the case decisively in ~~your~~ Bitcoin's favor right then and there. Just be chill about it if it drifts into some other topic and look for another opening to bring it up later on.

what i mean is, that same group doing the orchestrating sets up a hedge based on either hard fork succeeding, or forcing Satoshi to reveal he is alive and moving his coins, both substantially altering long established priced-in risk assumptions.

This company is so tangled up in shady connections it's insane.  This is what you get for hosting every shitcoin in existence. Most of them are crap used nothing but tumbling and obscuring movements of stolen BTC, and obviously pump &amp; dump scams to help with liquidity for these uses.  
Cryptsy also have a huge unpublicised connection to GAW (bigger than the PayCoin controller quid pro quo) that hasn't come out in this article, but by now the FinCEN people must know about it.  It will come up soon. Think hashrate.
Cryptsy have recently opened a new "branch" in Canada run by their head of compliance guy.  Watch this become the new main office of Cryptsy, and they leave their USA office, as this storm develops.  Their parent company is based, legally, in Belize.  Of course.
Then there is this Mintsy fiasco, linked to the DigitalBTC closure, which deprived them of most of their hashrate and gained them many new angry customers.  They are trying to distance themselves from as fast as they can.  
As a drama perk, all of the Cryptsy main players are linked in various ways to RealSolid and MCXNOW, which certainly makes things even more interesting.  
One of the Cryptsy chatroom mods was also on the moderator team for a little while until Ver bought it (oh did I say bought? I mean "took over" as a favour).  was initially used to hype a home-grown shitcoin made by one of the Cryptsy chat trolls.
Class acts, all around.

Water isn't particularly scarce, but we still have plenty of thriving markets for it.  Scarcity doesn't have to be anchored to some fixed availability quantum, it can just as easily be a phenomenon of local and temporary fluctuations in access to an unlimited supply.

For the purposes of transacting with their immediate circle of counterparties, it is.  People don't trust "the dollar", they trust the people they are trading dollars with. 
They don't even think about the unit they use unless something calls their attention to it.  Having to think about it at all increases its friction and decreases its value.  
This is why Bitcoin needs a killer app, a killer use case.  It needs something that makes it more appealing for the scope of uses that a non-ideologically motivated person actually cares about. A potential benefit that seems tangible enough to compel them to see the garden on the other side of the wall, but they have to climb it first. 
This takes effort and most people have a survival instinct trained by millions of years of evolution, that discourages them from expending resources toward uncertain results.
