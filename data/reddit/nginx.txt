Why do you feel the need to convince people to invest in something? Let them do whatever they want with their money. Just feel happy that you yourself invested.

Bitcoin has never been a get rich quick scheme. You can literally get the same percentage gains from any penny stock if that company becomes a Fortune 500 company someday. Same thing happened with Bitcoin and as usual most of us didn't believe in it when it was a penny coin.

If he is doing 4% of the job, that means he is getting 4% of what a fair wage should have been for that position.
Discontent is not restricted to just minimum wage jobs. I have worked in tech companies too and discontent for low pay exists there too because some guys are actually getting far lesser than their position demands and they know it. It's easy to say that one should quit and get a better paying job but when most companies want to screw you out of a fair wage, it's not easy. 
This all boils down to the fact that most employers want to get away with paying the bare minimum they can get away with instead of paying the fair market rate.

At some point Bitcoin too will need to get on the privacy train. Chain analysis tools are getting sophisticated and it won't be long before it becomes too hard for the average Joe to cover their tracks adequately so as not to link their Bitcoin wallet to their real world identity. Everytime I transact with Bitcoin, I feel like I have no clothes on as everyone can see my entire transaction history. 
We already have proven privacy technology. Monero has shown the way. Why not implement this on Bitcoin? Financial privacy is not a luxury. It is a necessity and it should be the default option.

So I have to give government a cut because my BTC went up in value? I can understand paying a part of my employment income as tax as I used the country's infrastructure to gain employment. I can understand paying a cut out of my stock market gains as the domestic companies are doing business by utilizing the resources and infrastructure of the country.
But why the heck would I pay the government a cut because someone in Hungary or China bought a shit load of Bitcoin and made my BTC more expensive? Government did absolutely nothing to contribute to those gains. No infrastructure or natural resources of the nation were used to generate those gains. The government has no right to tax those gains.

I am not surprised because every single day you keep that $310 million in the bank, the bank makes a killing. The amount of money the bank will earn from that deposit will be more than enough to cover any fees that the transaction might incur, so making it free is a no brainer to keep a healthy relationship with that client.
It still doesn't speak highly of the bankers. They are just using the inflation tax to dole out freebies. In the end you lose out by holding on to fiat in your bank.

Optional privacy is far worse. Anyone who uses that will stand out like a sore thumb and questions will be raised on why he opted for privacy on a specific transaction. Default forced privacy is way better since everyone will use it and fingers of suspicion cannot be pointed at anyone in particular.
Why is hiding money seen as a crime? Do you really want to divulge your entire transaction history and wallet balance to the world? It's a real security nightmare for high net worth individuals. Demanding privacy is not a crime. Financial privacy should be respected.

The equivalent of keeping money in a savings account would be keeping Bitcoins on an exchange. Would you suggest people do that so that the exchange can lend it to others like a bank?

It's a common misconception that doctors are very intelligent and rational people with critical thinking ability. On the contrary, many are highly superstitious and their logic and thought process can be extremely unscientific and erratic when it comes to topics outside the medical field. Many doctors don't even have critical thinking ability and they certainly never learned to challenge the status quo or whatever knowledge has been pushed down their throats.
I am not saying this just because we own Bitcoin and some doctors don't. This has been a general observation of mine when it comes to just about anything in life. Infact, these traits can be observed in people belonging to any profession. So we shouldn't judge someone's intellect based on their profession.

If the security was really important wherever he is working, then they would have paid way more for the job and it would have automatically attracted more hardworking people fit for the job. I don't see airport security staffs ever slacking off. That's because they are well compensated for their job. 
That fact that a slacker like him was hired and he gets to keep his job means the security is not that important at his workplace and the management wouldn't pay more than the peanuts they are offering him for someone better.
I see this all the time in places like malls where security is merely an afterthought. They keep a security guard because of some legal obligations. The management couldn't care less about security either way. So they pay a pittance for the position just for namesake. It's obvious that guys opting for that job are doing it because they have no other option but they certainly won't be motivated to work hard for that little pay.

Just went through your portfolio and I can easily see that you have quite a few winners there even though you have quite a few shitcoins there too. Winners, not in the sense that they are in loss currently but they are really great projects that will go up in value someday. 
Your biggest problem is that you are not patient enough. You are after the easy money. Somebody must have told you that altcoins are easy money and you dumped your entire load onto them. Even now you are banging your head against the wall despite the fact that it has only been 2 months or so since you invested. It ain't a loss unless you sell it. If you don't have the stomach to hold for a couple of years, then please find somewhere else to invest your money.
You want my advice? Keep the following and sell the rest:
Ethereum, NEM, Monero, Waves, GameCredits, Stratis, Golem, Factom, MaidSafeCoin
Altcoins are not a space where you can dump your money into anything you like and expect to win. You need to do some due diligence, infact lots of due diligence and you still have a 50-50 chance of winning.

Never said taxes are bad but when direct and indirect taxation rate is so high that it leaves just 30-40% of your hard earned income in your pocket, it's nothing but highway robbery. There are many countries in the world doing just fine with 5-10% tax. Hell there are even countries with 0% tax. Of course those countries don't waste public money on wars and corruption, so it makes sense that they don't need to rape the public with taxes.
Of course the taxes alone are not enough, the government has to print more money and devalue the currency to charge another form of hidden tax.
@_date: 2019-10-20 07:13:11

When enough people believe in a currency, it can work. There is no need for any sort of backing. If a billion people believe in Bitcoin and all I need is another believer to exchange my Bitcoin for the goods and services he provides, then that's all that required for the currency to function. This nonsense narrative of Bitcoin needing a backing to work is just nonsense. 
What is fiat backed by? Nothing but thin air. It's worth something because the government says it's worth something. Tomorrow if the government declares that it's worthless, you are fucked. Currency is not an asset, it's just a tool to assign value to goods and services and facilitate it's exchange by having enough divisibility and liquidity.
Bitcoin is a better currency because it takes power away from the government to manipulate it or declare it as worthless which will no doubt ruin countless lives overnight.
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:40:24

Lol do you think fiat transactions you do in the supermarket or coffee shop are instantly verified by the bank or the Credit Card company? All transactions are merely recorded on a temporary ledger and then settled at the end of the day via batch programming in some third world country's IT farm.

This guy for sure wouldn't be dead now if he held Bitcoin instead of fiat. He could have sold his stash to any buyer OTC and gotten the money for his heart surgery.

I never told anyone about my holdings nor did I preach to anyone about Bitcoin. Why should I? I think if something is really good, people will find out about it on their own sooner or later. If something is really useful, it will be adopted with or without me preaching about it. I don't need attention or derision from people by talking about my financial investments. I certainly don't need their unsolicited advice on where to put my money.
Lke you said, let them FOMO in later when Bitcoin is already mainstream and worth $200k a coin.

The government needs money? Just print more.

Any currency with such a small marketcap is gonna be extremely volatile. If you expect USD or GBP like stability, you have to wait until Bitcoin's marketcap reaches close to those currencies. When the marketcap is too big for any single entity to cause significant price movement in either direction, only then can it be stable.

What exactly is manipulation according to you? If I had a networth of $100m and dumped $10m into Bitcoin just now, I reckon you would see a $1000 spike immediately. Tomorrow if I dumped my stash for whatever reason, the price may very well dump by $900 depending on how much liquidity is in the market. Will you call this manipulation? If little guys buy and sell, it's trading but when the whales do it, it suddenly becomes manipulation?

Bitcoin was never invented to address the wealth disparity that exists in society. It was merely invented to be a transparent and decentralized form of currency which cannot be manipulated by the government.

It wasn't meant to be like that. But since our manufactured fiat currencies can't hold value for any significant length of time, we were forced to invest our money in other hard assets. What's wrong with a currency that is liquid, has velocity, cannot be manipulated or inflated and can also retain it's value? It's the holy grail we have been looking for since time immemorial and it's here. Bitcoin is the answer.

Well I think you did it right. As the saying goes, you should never sell everything because it's important to stay in the market and have skin in the game as you can never predict the top in real time. When price hit $18k, you had no way of knowing that $20k would be the top. If price went to $50k or $100k and you sold everything at 18k, you would be cursing yourself all year long.
Always take profits but stay in the game unless the fundamentals change dramatically and crypto fails as an asset class. Even I could have retired if I sold everything in Jan 2018 but I only booked partial profits. I regretted for a while but then realized I made a sensible decision since I couldn't have known a crypto winter would follow for the next 2 years. Hindsight is a bitch. In any case, I am sure this isn't the end of crypto and we would be here to talk about it 10 years later.
@_date: 2019-10-30 06:38:36
No, paper money being backed by Bitcoin essentially means that for every bitcoin issued by the government in the form of paper money, it would have to hold 1 BTC in it's reserve. The paper money would essentially serve as a guarantee that you can go to the bank and redeem it for the stated amount of BTC at any time.
Of course, this can only work if the government is honest and holds the required amount of BTC for the paper money issued at all times. But we know those crooks don't work like that. Who is gonna audit the total supply of paper money? We will go down the same fractional reserve rabbit hole again in no time.

I don't think I will be ever be "ALL IN" BTC or crypto for that matter but I won't be out of the market completely either like I did in the past thinking I can buy my entire stack at a lower price point. They tell you to always remain invested aka always have skin in the game for a reason.
They key is to decide on a percentage of the portfolio that you will allocate to BTC and invest more when the price goes down. That's the only way to stay in the game and also ensure you don't go bankrupt if BTC fails.

Assuming Bitcoin is the defacto currency in this futuristic world and everyone is paying their taxes in Bitcoin and spending money in Bitcoin too, governments can't just keep accumulating taxed bitcoins, they have to spend it too. How does continuous accumulation and zero spending work? As supply keeps constricting, the price will keep going up, resulting in lower accumulation over time.
@_date: 2019-10-30 06:50:07
No country can ever hold all the coins. That is only possible if everyone else decides to sell their entire stash and we know that ain't happening. Besides, governments have huge expenditures to keep the country running and develop infrastructures. So they will have to spend their coins and keep the money circulating in the process.

May be I am lucky that I live in a country where I can get 10% out of debt funds. So any loan at 0% interest is a no brainer for me. Banks wouldn't give personal loans below 15% here. The only way to get a 0% loan would be from friends, so no question of custody fee, processing fee yada yada yada.

Mining cost never sets the price floor. When will this myth stop propagating? If price crashes to $1000 tomorrow, it doesn't matter that it costs $6000 to mine a single coin. It will simply cause many miners to hang up their boots and subsequently reducing the difficulty, thus reducing the mining cost to $1000 or lower.
@_date: 2019-10-19 06:21:12
That's because even the precious metals like gold and silver are inflationary by nature since the Earth is not running out of these resources anytime soon. Fresh gold/silver are being mined everyday and hence the supply keeps increasing which can only lead to dilution in value. This is exactly why Bitcoin is way better than any precious metal as the inflation will eventually stop.

Social gatherings are definitely nice but only with people you are comfortable with and people who like you for who you really are. That means you don't have to pretend to be someone you are not to get their approval or appear cool. 
But this whole discussion about parties started because OP insinuated that you aren't cool at parties unless you drive in with your lambo. That is when some people hit back by saying parties are a waste of money.
Some people also try to insinuate that attending parties is the only purpose of life and all your investments and materialistic purchases should be based on what makes you cool in parties. This kind of thinking is what prompted a few people to hit back. I don't think anyone in real life actually has a problem with paying for a drink or two for their friend or relative if they are really close with one another.

BTC just broke out of the downtrend channel. This is literally the best time to buy. Of course there might be a retest of the downtrend channel which will allow you a lower entry but a retest doesn't always happen. So I am just gonna wait for a slight pullback to buy some more. In any case, I am never out of the market, so I am fine either way.

You have raised an excellent point. The fact that BTC paper money can be redeemed for real coins by anyone in the free market without going to a central authority gives it a decisive advantage over gold. Having said that, any sign of loss of faith in the paper money and the face value of it would instantly drop and 1 BTC of paper money cannot be redeemed for 1 real BTC anymore.
The Tether experiment is similar in many ways. It maintains it's $1 peg as long as people believe there is enough reserve of real dollars in the company's bank account for everyone to redeem the tokens. When that faith was lost temporarily, Tether's value instantly sunk below 90 cents on the dollar.
This is why I am skeptical of trusting bankers and the government with this shit. Why not promote the use of real BTC as much as possible? We all have smartphones. Perhaps paper money in very limited amounts could be issued for those who still don't use smartphones or are out of network coverage.
@_date: 2019-10-19 07:13:52
Well we kinda want to keep it that way, don't we? If everybody becomes smart money, then there wouldn't be any dumb money left to buy and the price won't go up. It's a good thing that we can't predict the top or bottom with any kind of certainty.

This "priced in" mechanism only works on shorter timeframes and not on longer timeframes. If there was some big news which was due to be announced a month later but is already known today, it can be priced in now but the market participants cannot account for an event that's is supposedly many months or years away. If that was possible, all halvings until 2120 would have been priced in already.

I also do all the plumbing and electrical work on the houses myself. I am self-taught. Nothing wrong with it as far as I am concerned.
At the end of the day, if I can do something myself, I definitely won't be taking the help of a middleman. It helps me save costs and bring in more profits.

If somebody does become a millionaire, the first thing he will do is leave the shithole country where Bitcoin is banned and immigrate to some nation that has embraced Bitcoin and also has favorable tax laws. Then he will reside there for more than 6 months which will grant him non-resident Indian status which means his income is no longer taxable in India. He will cash out his Bitcoins, pay minimum tax on it and return back to India with all the money. Alternatively, he may decide never to return to India.

Most tech companies in the service sector charge their clients way more than what they pay their employees for the project.

All we can hope for is that all countries will not come to an unanimous agreement to ban crypto and some will become pro-Bitcoin.

If property tax keeps rising to such an extent that retirees find it difficult to pay up, that means there is a big problem with how the tax laws are framed. Nobody should lose their house on failing to pay property tax. This is ridiculous.
Where I live, the property tax is peanuts. Not even the poorest of people will struggle to pay that. It also doesn't rise with the increased valuation of the property. I also don't know anyone who has lost his property due to non-payment of property tax. It remains pending for years but nothing happens.

Most people only look at the electricity cost of mining Bitcoin but completely forget about the huge investment in hardware required to mine a bitcoin. That hardware is a depreciating asset and so the investment has to be recouped by selling the mined Bitcoins at a healthy profit margin. 
Also manufacturing any product whose price fluctuates so much everyday is risky business and high risk means the seller has to factor in more premium while selling.
Considering all these factors, the open market price of BTC as it currently stands is more than fair even if it costs $6.5k to mine one. It's not like other commodity makers manufacture their shit for $1000 and then sell it for $1001. There is always a significant margin to every product we buy from the supermarket.

The average cost to mine will always be close to current price. The current price determines the mining cost and not the other way around. The difference between minimum and maximum cost to mine a BTC at any point of time is mostly down to the different electricity rates in various places.

Too many people believe in Bitcoin now. As long as there are buyers, price will never drop to zero. Events like the third world war will actually make Bitcoin's price soar as many nation's fiat currencies will become worthless toilet paper and people will have no choice but to buy Bitcoin to escape poverty.

Well its fun as long as the price is moving in either direction. It only sucks when its stagnant. Volatility equals money but BTC was stagnating for the last couple of weeks.

Dude do you know how to read charts? BTC was getting squeezed inside a large symmetric triangle. So it had to break out violently in some direction and it did just that in the upward direction.
This is not market manipulation. Many traders including me had their conditional buy orders set above the breakout zone. Some whale obviously triggered the breakout with the initial push but after that those large number of conditional buy orders executed and this was followed by liquidation of a large number of shorts. Check out BTCUSD Shorts on Bitfinex which just collapsed as many people got margin called. Everything happened in unison and this caused the violent spike.
You have to remember that the liquidity in exchanges is miniscule compared to the circulating supply. So it doesn't require billions of dollars to pump the price by $1k in 30 minutes. I know conspiracy theories are fun and all but that's rarely the case.

Liquidation of shorts was one of the end goals of whoever pumped the price. Unless you clean out the shorters, it's difficult for the downtrend to reverse. It's overbought on all timeframes upto the 4H at the moment. So I imagine, there will be some selling off down to $7.2k levels followed by consolidation but IMO the purpose of the pump was achieved.

Ah a douchebag. How is life treating you?

Agreed. People have been conditioned and preached to believe that any market movement that goes against the little guys is market manipulation. Yes, a lot of little guys who had shorts open got margin called and were crushed today. 
Some whale took a calculated risk in going against the market sentiment and it paid off for him. A lot of people have to lose money for a few to gain big. This is how margin trading works. It's stupid to call it manipulation.

It goes without saying that the whale is taking significant risk himself to do this since if the price doesn't go high enough, he may lose out. So yes, it's a calculated move based on risk vs reward. It paid off for him, so kudos. I wouldn't call it manipulation. It's part of the game.

Nothing wrong with it. Trading is all about making money. If I had the buying power of a whale, I would do it too.

Wtf? USDT is not supposed to go down when people are selling. That's why it's called Tether. It's tethered to USD rate and backed by equivalent amount of USD. It's not supposed to behave like a normal cryptocurrency having wild swings in price due to low market cap.

I think there will be a pullback. Look at that chart. Grandpa is going vertical. We blow the top soon and cool down for a while.

BTC is backed by people's trust and that's worth more than the government's word.
