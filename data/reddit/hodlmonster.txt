Only if we don’t sell

Go ahead and time the market Nostradamus. Join the ever growing list of people who regret selling bitcoin.

Go buy bitcoin right now—someone will set it to you for a little over 10K. The market price is an equilibrium of buyers &amp; sellers.

Anyone who's paying attention knows the charts repeat over and over again, with larger numbers, going back to the very beginning. Bitcoin is always building new floors, which get cemented in after big unthinkable breakouts.

Bitcoin is always building new floors--over and over again--which get established after the big fat bubbles. Pay attention.

Two rules of bitcoin:
1. HODL
2. BTFD

I find it amusing that each bull rally is equally astounding to people in its majesty.
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:34:14
You’re gonna miss the show. This your first Bitcoin bull run?
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:47:59
If you think people cashing in Bitcoin for houses is gonna stop Bitcoin from mooning, then you fail to grasp the economics of the financial and banking predicament the world currently finds itself in. There IS no reason for everyone on this planet not to be wealthy given the vast amount of productivity we produce. The entity that stops us from enjoying the wealth we create is the banking cabal, who hoards it all for themselves. BTC is peer-to-peer. We’re going around the banks now. Time to liberate the world. We’re not debt slaves for much longer here.
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:05:34
Yeah. First time I bought into a BTC bull market I paid $10 when the price was 25 cents months prior. This ain’t nothing. People who treat Bitcoin like a stock end up losing or missing the show.

Your problem is turning it into fiat.

Hey IRS, have ya’ll seen my BTC?? I swear I can’t find it anywhere.
@_date: 2019-06-30 14:30:56
The banks gave him that idea, and all his other dumb ideas, via intense propaganda and misinformation, as they own pretty much this entire fucked up world.
@_date: 2019-06-28 06:38:38
Get off your fucking high horse, snowflake. This sub always gets like this when the market is on the move. Doesn’t mean any of us have forgotten what Bitcoin is.

Wait we’re allowed to go to sleep?

No, you’re equating the fed’s control of the dollar to whales’ control of Bitcoin. The fed OWNS the dollar, they can create as many new ones as they want FOR FREE and then sell those to us, profiting astronomically while also diluting the rest of our dollars. Bitcoin whales don’t have this type of authority. All they can do is leverage the amount they have relative to everyone else to influence the price in the short term, but in the long term they have a disincentive to do so, as extra volatility long term would bring the price down, and allow for competing currencies where wales are smaller. Remember, even gold has whales. 
Government money is stable, but at what cost?...The value of the money in your hands itself ends up being the cost. Is disintegrates in your hands. That’s the cost of your valued “stability”.
In the long term, I see bitcoin being about as stable as gold or maybe less so but who cares. all things fluctuate, and these fluctuations mean less and less when you liberate the world from its current zero sum banking game. Bitcoin has the power to do this by stripping central banks of their control over their given populations, and this allows people to keep their own wealth and productivity and get richer and richer.

BTC builds new floors for itself, explodes from those floors to unconscious heights, and then comes back down and settles at a new floor. Taking profit at an old ATH is a mistake
@_date: 2019-06-28 06:41:16
What a wonderful phrase!
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:07:19
We're gonna be 30, flirty, and thriving... 30, flirty, and THRIVING!
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:46:56
I totally agree. Been following BTC almost every day since 2011 and I’ve seen this movie over and over again. Bitcoin always builds new floors for itself, then explodes from those floors to unthinkable new heights, then comes all the way back to settle into a new floor. Each time the numbers get bigger.
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:15:46
There is no such thing as a long term depression phase for Bitcoin. Not this early. Bitcoin is always going up, albeit in a volatile fashion.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:57:22
Everyone buys into a bull market their first time. When I first bought in for $10, it was only 25 cents months prior. When you let enough time pass, nobody ever regrets buying...they only regret selling. Unfortunately I had to learn that the hard way back then as well.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:17:17
Fiat value is ALWAYS going down--it's in the very nature of its design. 
Bitcoin value is ALWAYS going up, just in a highly volatile fashion (in the beginning)--also the nature of its design.

What did BTC start out at, do you know?
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:28:18
We feast on dips. Fortunes are made when there’s blood in the streets.

Libertarianism ���� apparently Bitcoin was just a bunch of computer geeks in the very beginning but certain libertarians I followed back then started talking about it. I was going to school for economics at the time and I read satoshi’s white paper and loved it. Libertarians began to believe this was our way to defeat the banking cabal. It’s funny remembering people back then saying we’d be millionaires if BTC hits 10K �� and even allllll the way back then we’re talking about a million dollar bitcoin! I bought my first 100 bitcoin on Mt Gox lol, I still remember how clunky the whole transaction was start to finish and the hoops I had to jump through. I didn’t end up with nearly that many BTC, as I was a freaking broke college kid who met the love of his life and was desperate for cash lol
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:36:34
This is gonna a big one. We have these constantly throughout BTC’s history. The numbers just get bigger each time. Nothing on earth can stop Bitcoin from mooning.

Good short term move, everyone will be pushing BTC to new ATHs, but halving is coming up for LTC--lots of that price increase has already been priced in though. I expect the LTC/BTC ratio to bottom out around .006 to .007, and then move hard against BTC after the halving, and possibly break through to .03

Never sell. Only buy. The first and only rule of investing in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:30:40
Yeah and it was a terrifying transaction lol and I was trying to learn it all on my own. Freaking paper wallets. I knew the economics of it but the tech part was scary and it was the Wild West back then, everyone was losing coins or getting them stolen. I remember when Coinbase finally came out I was like now THIS is how you can buy some damn Bitcoin!!!
I actually held way longer than that—into the second half of 2012 when I desperately needed some money. I sold most of my stack for around $15, before the big boom of course lol. Learned my first lesson the hard way �� then began mining LTC 2013-2014 with a techy friend, and then eventually re-bought back into BTC sub 300 in oct 2015

This is exactly what the all time BTC chart already looks like if you could fit it onto one page (without the flat part at the top). Btc will move in this pattern, and already does. It’s an exponential adoption curve, and all new breakthrough technologies follow this same curve as well.

I first bought in for $10 when it was 25 cents only months prior, and then took a massive short run haircut at $2, so I feel your pain.

Your only job is to HODL

Bitcoin builds new floors to launch rallies from after each bull run/bear market cycle. We're launching from much higher ground this time, just like we did the time before that, and the time before that, and the time before that....

Shoulda laid off that MaidSafe, Bart. You'll figure it out sometime before we hit 6 figures...
