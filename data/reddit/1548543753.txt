"Wax on....and leave it on..."  
"Err, you sure?"

No, not right.
You seem really confused.
For sure, if bitcoin goes up, you make money, but I'm not sure how you imagine that is tied to bitcoin being used as currency.
GBP are used as currency. They aren't worth $100000 each are they?
Somewhat ironically perhaps when I was a kid, GBP was well over $5 - so, mr expert, that was over 40 years ago, when are they going to be worth $10? It's just a dip, obviously. Because, as far as I can see, if you paid $5 for some £ in the 70s, it's worth a lot, lot less now - and not just because of the exchange rate either.
Yet, over that same period I would say that GBP proved itself as "the future of money" for Britain.
So explain how a dip doesn't lose any of your capital.

Just tell the people who shorted it how you'd like to see your money spent

But they could study a giraffe's scrotum or the heat-cooling cycles on the planet Boogledoodledoo, if you think they gave you some insight into the future of price you're lucky if you turned out to be "correct" and buy and sell at the right time.
i.e Smart people can delude themselves using smart things, like drawing a croggit-hatcher graph instead of the normal ziggy zaggy one, or doing some fancy pants statistical analysis, but none of that bullshit is really behind their success - that's the whole point of not listening to Warren Buffett simply because he's the one guy that made billions.
You'd absolutely expect with millions of traders there to be one big winner.

That seems unlikely because stupid money, dreams and schemes are still around. When they all panic sell and leave then it'll probably stabilize and see slow steady growth, but not until.

zig zag theory. It zigs and zags and you look how it zigged and zagged in the past and then say "hmmmmmm" and then you click 'buy' or 'sell'
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:49:31
Exactly. That's like studying a giraffe's scrotum. Smart people probably do that in zoos or the wild.
If they buy or don't bitcoin on the basis of their giraffe research they are in no better or worse position than these "smart" people you believe have studied blockchains or whatever else before investing.
Sure they are smart, but it doesn't help.
Imagine you know 2 smart people one votes republican the other democrat. That tells you that being smart doesn't help at all when it comes to politics. Same here.

Listen to my talk *"How I shorted bitcoin this morning and made $1000 in the time it took to have a dump and then spent the rest of the day gloating online like I was Warren Buffett"*
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:11:41
Sheesh. You don't understand speaking hypothetically?
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:27:41


And who would pick up? Al-Qaeda?
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:55:40
low, lower, lowest. These are not the same.
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:25:44
What? You're making no sense.
Bitcoin's value as a currency means you still lose.
It's like if you went to a car dealership with bitcoins worth $5000 each and got the guy to sell you a $20000 car for 4 bitcoins.
Now you're telling the dealer, when those bitcoins are worth $200 each that he hasn't lost money because he can still spend the bitcoins? He had a $20000 car and ended up with $800.

Hehehe. You ever heard of Ross William Ulbricht?
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:28:22
Well, no it doesn't. Cutting your losses is not a bad strategy
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:30:59
pornhub down?
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:50:38


Yeah, that's complete and utter horseshit. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:38:09
I made a point.
You claimed the strategy of selling low was bad. I pointed out that it isn't when compared with selling even lower.
This is simple mathematical fact.
One that flew over your somewhat ignorant head.


Whatever, Warren Buffett must be shaking in his boots.

Enjoy living in your bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:20:37
Going from being completely clueless and never having invested one day, to investing your whole $700k in one thing is moronic. Doing it twice? Jeez.
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:18:06
Yeah because selling them at $3000 would be stupid if they fall to $200..right?
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:01:16
If you wanted to invest in nvidia or coca cola you wouldn't go and buy a graphics card and a 24 pack would you?
Get a trading account and you can spread your investments. Short it as well if need be.
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:14:18


Well, no. I believe a £1 today is going to be worth less than £1 in the future, same for $, € et al.
I still believe in money and that money has a future.
Bitcoin's future as a currency is complete unrelated to this speculative 'get rich quick' stuff.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:22:10
What? The "point" I made was a simple, unarguable mathematical fact.
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:03:30
Haha, right. All you have to do is wait until it hits $60k. D'oh.
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:46:11
Erm, no. That's not true.
If it drops to $3000 and you don't sell, you lose more money if it drops to $1000 and then more money if it drops to $200.
The value of your assets is just that, their value, and anyone who bought bitcoin for more than their current value has lost money.
That doesn't preclude them losing more or possibly gaining again - however it's crass fuckwittery to claim that the loss is only realised if you sell.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:48:06
No it doesn't. Sheesh. Wake up.
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:39:15


It definitely means you shouldn't just buy one thing
