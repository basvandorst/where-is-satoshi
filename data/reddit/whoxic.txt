Thanks for the idea, just did that. Sadly didnt see any email from them on any email address I had. Searched all the way back to 2009
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:31:16
Its been DBAN'd using DOD 5220.22-M standards.

I checked all of my current and prior addresses for anything relating to a bitcoin wallet and found nothing sadly. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:33:53
Thats what I figured lol
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:34:55
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:25:58
I understand that this is a wallet address but im still rather tech illiterate so if you can explain what I can do with it it would be a big help. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:34:32
I wasnt using gmail at the time. I was using Yahoo and Hotmail. Both of which seem to have nothing reltating to BTC on them.
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:34:34
How do you go about searching for them? 
@_date: 2017-06-20 21:37:50
Trying to call me out m8?

I think out our best way to narrow it down would be to find an address with a single transfer from an account who's only activity has ever been generating 10 sets of 50BTC. I remember that for a fact it was 10 blocks with 50BTC rewards each. So the coins have to have been generated before November 28, 2012, since that was when the first block halving event happened.
Im sure that would most certainly only leave a couple select addresses

I think it was before blockchain existed
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:33:47
HDD it was on has been overwritten, formatted and DBAN'd with DOD 5220.22-M standards multiple times sadly.
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:08:24
not so much lol Lots of great ideas though
@_date: 2017-06-07 03:10:26
I think I remember it being very barebones with a sign in at the top right.
While I still have the HDD the wallet was stored on its been written over and DBAN'd many times so there pretty much no chance of recovery.
Ive assumed its been gone this whole time. But you know, cant hurt to try!
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:32:55
Tried it all, nothing even relating to in in my emails.
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:28:42
Also it says that wallet has a current balance of 499.72061 BTC
Mine was exactly 500BTC in one transfer.
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:35:47
I dont believe it did. I think that it was a Username and Password access to get on to the wallet
@_date: 2017-06-09 23:03:30
Made the reward that high since that what my friend wanted if he could find them himself lol
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:57:22
I'm pretty sure it was more like the standard user/pass kind of thing
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:36:21
Thanks but I dont have any private key and I seem to remember the site being a user/pass situation
Username: Whoxic
Password: *********
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:33:22
Yeah I understand, im really just doing this just incase you know haha
Would be nice to have  a quick 1.4mil
I think it may have had a login at the top right of the screen but know nothing more sorry
@_date: 2017-06-07 03:06:20
Its a .onion hosted online wallet
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:55:25
Is it a .onion? :)
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:34:16
Ahh thats true, is it possible to track the address back to a .onion?
@_date: 2017-06-09 23:02:11
Haha I know, I put this up because it really cant hurt to try. Ive considered them long gone years ago.
But, im actually messaging quite a few people right now and we seem to have narrowed it down to a few wallets. Just in the process of actually finding if those wallets belong to any banks.
