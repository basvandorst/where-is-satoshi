Sub to r/btc if you want see the other side

Ha! You must be new here ...

So you mean the problem is not the miners ... but the current BTC network capacity vs. the expectation of most users?
@_date: 2017-09-26 21:38:47
You're a student, right?
So ask yourself who stands to gain from crippling the network to arbritrary 1mb block size limit in the face of Moore's law and common sense.
"corporate bitcoin" - what, vendors and miners who want to see BTC get mass adoption for transactions &amp; moon in value &amp; # of nodes?
Or is Core, who are bankrolled largely by a central venture capital corporate entity to the tune of $70 million USD with investors wanting return on investment via layer 2 fees,  the real corporate bitcoin and the real attack?

At least from his statements, he has made it quite clear he supports layer 2 solutions, just prefers to Max out on chain scaling with a moderate and long discussed block size increase for now while we wait for LN and full segwit adoption .
Many people share this view - and 90% plus of miners are signaling for this exact and pretty sensible compromise.

"First you must understand what Bitcoin has a primary functions. It's to stay decentralised."
Remaining decentralised isn't the primary function - peer to peer cash is the primary economic function. 
If decentralising is the primary objective - why are we   proposing centralised lightning network nodes to pick up the slack?
"most people have never participated in a peer to peer system."
Hmm so the Napster limewire days were just a dream... 
Any computer post 2006 (raspberry pis / netbooks aside) can run 2mb blocks. What's the point in a decentralised system propped up with ancient hardware with fickle fee and block time confirmations - no business will use it. Back to the drawing board folks.
I actually prefer Dash's system for incentivised nodes - about 5000 running so far I believe. They get a significant % of the block reward (I think 10%) they're testing 1GB blocks soon.

Why is bitcoin fee estimation in software / wallets seemingly so bad? 
Especially when we're just bankrolling miners (who are often toted as public enemy no. 1 to bitcoin) 
So question to BTC / wallet devs .... why are we throwing so much cash at them by default?

Oh snaaap! You got me :-(

- Developing world use cases.
- E-commerce. 
- POS in brick &amp; mortar stores 
Oh well no big loss, I'm sure ... 2MB blocks?!? That means Rpi 3 not 2 for my node REEEEEEEEE

Yawn - think we've had enough of these "witty" comparisons.
Care to talk about November?

Who is the CTO (chief technical officer) of Blockstream?
Why, if it isn't the one and same wizard in chief at core, Greg Maxwell.
Do you suppose this is a voluntary position ...
There are and have been many voluntary contributors to BTC and there will continue to be long after the current crop at the top move on.

This sub seems to exist for Jamie Dimon "memes" made by adoring 14yos.

Mass adoption is the best way to decentralise and survive the coming regulatory hostile environment.
Miners are currently being bankrolled by wallets and exchanges due to how stupidly bad fee estimation algorithms cope with this block size constraint.
Well in fact not bad, because the vast majority of users expect transactions to be confirmed in next block (on threat of numerous panicky emails from users to wallet devs &amp; exchanges). However blocks are more or less full. This turns the fee into more of a bounty.
Miners see the bigger picture and want mass adoption - so that the value of their mined coins &amp; Tx volume will moon.
What hardware is required to run the LN network? More than a 2012 raspberry pi I'd guess. Who will collect fees for the LN network? Who is in charge of this settlement layer? I think that's a bigger centralization risk than modestly larger blocks.

Here here! Wonder how long this thread stays open
@_date: 2017-09-23 07:10:07
What accurate measure do you suggest?
@_date: 2017-10-07 23:14:19
Why would unconstrained on chain transactions and increased world wide adoption be in the interest of banks?
