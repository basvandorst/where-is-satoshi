Put what's left of the money back to bitcoin and forget the wallet ever exist. In months maybe or years to come you'll be back to having enough.
This is a lesson for you. Learn from it.
Speaking of those that forget about you, you know what they don't know which is the source of the wealth. Use that in your favor and never make such mistake again.
You're lucky you still have few cash left.
Sorry for you man

That's a bad business. Stabbing them behind their back.

Okay. Be careful over there, some of those guys are scam. Just follow the instructions on the sidebar and all should go well.
