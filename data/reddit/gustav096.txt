Bitmain includes backdoors in their miners to disable them remotely. This means at any instant they can do a 51% attack in Bcash blockchain .
Stay away from Bcash

Bitcoin has lots of improvements coming up. Financial institutions are heavily betting on BTC - not Bcash

They assumed the cost of electricity won't go up. 
It will. And once it does, lots of mining operations will drop off thus reducing electricity needs. And repeat

I'm only commenting on the wording Jerez 
Bitpay are not "bullying" anyone. They're influencing.  The word bully is way overused and most of the time it's used to evoke an emotional response to influence

Coinbase is FDIC insured. Your electrum wallet isn't.  
CORRECTION: not FDIC
Coinbase prioritizes the security of our customer's funds, all digital currency that Coinbase holds online is insured. If Coinbase were to suffer a breach of its online storage, the insurance policy would pay out to cover any customer funds lost as a result. Coinbase holds less than 2% of customer funds online. The rest is held in offline storage.

Yes exactly this

If this ranks crypto with the most hype then it's accurate.   
Reverse the order and you get the most powerful crypto.

You'll only lose if you're paying for electricity 
But I agree, don't mine BTC
Use CPU miner to mine monero.  Just go to any Starbucks and they'll mine on your browser for you lol

Most people are buying with Litecoin the transactions are much quicker and cheaper.  During peaks, ETH transactions take over a day to complete 
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:38:44
I have a feeling they're preventing market manipulation. Buy LTC for cheap on random exchange, transfer to GDAX and sell for higher, and repeat. There's a $20 difference between LTC price on Coinbase vs other exchanges
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:47:07
Don't blindly buy penny coins without doing your research.  You will lose in the long term.  $5 isn't much money but you are supporting scam coins and other noobs will see your purchase orders and try to get in on this too.  
Instead of investing into crap we need to make the top 3 coins stronger than ever BTC, ETH, LTC.

Bcash supporters own the miners for bitcoin. They've been introducing back doors to manipulate and remotely disable miners.  What that means is that Bcash people will be doing a 51% attack on BCH blockchain 
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:27:19
It's worse than that. Their strategy is to do a 51% attack and control the blockchain. After more and more people start using BCH instead of BTC
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:28:45
What are you basing this on? 
@_date: 2018-01-02 10:27:17
Yes. Buy and forget about it
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:06:26
Difficulty drops drastically and you'll be able to mine bitcoin on regular PCs.  Price might go down a bit too but it will stabilize as people will start buying it up on the dips expecting the difficulty to increase with time.
@_date: 2018-01-02 10:29:54
You're not going to get rich mining bitcoin unless you invest a ridiculous amount of money.  
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:25:27
Bitcoin.com is a scam because the owner is trying to make BCH into BTC and since the BCZh people own bitmain.com (bitcoin miner asics) and can control all mining power via backdoors in their machines (one was already found this summer) they will be able to pull a 51% attack on BCH blockchain 
@_date: 2018-01-04 09:09:29
I'm sorry but this can't be legit. The price is lower than bitmain.  Also bitmain provides 90 days warranty from shipment date.  Since they don't have authorized resellers, it's not possible for this site to have 180 day warranty.

Fuck BCH! Such a scam. There's only drama because of BCH backers trying to f things up
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:54:57
BTC (not BCH) is like gold.  You buy it, invest in it, and sell it only when you need the profit.  For daily exchange use litecoin with quick transactions and .20 fees.  Lots of retailers are accepting litecoin too. 
BCH is like Hillary Clinton. Corrupt AF

@_date: 2017-12-21 21:50:26
Just avoid buying BCH . Bitcoin not going anywhere. Eth has solid growth behind them but slow. Litecoin will blow up later.. I'm waiting for it to go down to 200-250 level tho

He's trying to spread panic for his own gain.  
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:08:56
The guys behind BCH are the makers of bitcoin miners. Their miners had a backdoor to stop all mining if they flip a switch. Anything related to BCH is fucking shady 
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:03:52
I disagree. Mining is profitable 
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:20:38
Just use litecoin of Eth or some other coin for transactions and stay away from bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:01:30
This seems like a bug in the blockchain to me if you can send one currency to a different wallet and the transaction gets validated.  
Can someone eli5 to me how this can happen? And yes I do realize LTC is a clone of BTC code

Crypto is stronger than any other currency.  Governments can seize your $$ , they can't touch your crypto. There will always be people need crypto to stay alive and they'll support it.  Governments will try to manipulate it as well.

There are some influential (mining) powerful people behind BCH who want to bring down BTC. There are others as well who want another drop in BTC. They'll drive the price higher than ever after buying up a shit ton of BTC at its lowest
