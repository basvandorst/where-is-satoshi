While they all talk about sport ball teams and bitch that brad is stealing all the food. Everyone thinks they are smart in their own world.

And all I have to show is a 3d printer. At least I can print a one time use gun to shoot myself, that's a plus.

Word on the streeternet is that it was actually a group of a few play writers who came together to make up billy shakes so they could slap his name on any play they wrote. Like how a business will use the rights to say star wars and out of nowhere, your now buying a bag of oranges just because it has a logo you know.

Honest question, why is bitcoin not a currency?  I agree people use bitcoin as investment but why does that make it not a currency?
@_date: 2018-04-24 20:49:26
Can't you just say it's not a stable currency? Why go the length of adding extra qualifications to the definition of currency. There is an argument of whether it's viable currency or not but I'm unconvinced that it doesn't qualify as currency.

We're taking about currency. Why is that no one will trash talk someone saving in fiat but crypto needs to be spent. I get we need circulation to make a crypto work but it seems like reddit forgets that whole purpose is to do whatever you want with your crypto because you own your keys.
Personally, I use crypto as a savings but I always try to use crypto instead of fiat when possible (really just on the internet because I live in ny). 
If we really want a crypto/decentralized economy, why wouldn't the disscution be about how to spend crypto over fiat instead of how hodl vs spedl. 
Mass adoption is key for cryptocurrencies and everyone involved knows this. I can't find an argument for why fiat is overall better than crypto. This is a time where the facts should be understood. Anyone who wants to trade back into fiat just needs to be informed (and everyone who only uses fiat for that matter). 
 Informing rational people will have a better results in expanding the crypto economy. Once the greater majority of the human race converts away from fiat, whether someone wants to spend or save will be a non problem.
