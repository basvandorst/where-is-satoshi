I found [this](  
Not really a satisfying answer though

There are 2^(160) possible public addresses.  
There are 2^(256) possible private keys.  
To generate a public address:  
Private Key  → Public Key  → Public Address (starting with 1)  
So for each public address corresponds 2^(256-160) = 2^(96) private keys.  
A collision is still extremely unlikely to find.  
It doesn't necessary means that if I find a private key that gives the same public address as someone, I could spend their bitcoins.  
If someone received a transaction in a Pay-To-PubKey format (P2PK), I wouldn't be able to spend their bitcoins because my public key (derived from my private key) might be different, but still produce the same public address (starting with 1).  
But if someone received a transaction in a Pay-To-PubKey-Hash format (P2PKH: PubKey-Hash is a public address starting with 1), then I would be able to spend their bitcoins because my public address would be the same as theirs, even though my public key might not.

What does that even mean
@_date: 2019-11-23 15:15:34
how is this even possible

You can guess a private key is lost if funds haven't moved in many years I suppose.  
There also exists the concept of Proof of Burn where people send bitcoins to public addresses which don't have any corresponding private key, such as [1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXUWLpVr](  
You can track bitcoins that are unspendable forever.

If you know your recipient's public address, what I would do is :
* Build a raw tx with the recipient's address
* Sign the tx
* Encode the signed tx as a QR Code
* Print the QR Code in an envelop with a cool message
Now you let them redeem / broadcast the signed TX themselves!    
EDIT: If they don't have a wallet yet, you could generate a deterministic wallet for them, generate a public address for the tx, and write the mnemonic words in the envelop (make sure this is the only copy, and that you do not have any copy of the words).    
Another way would be to generate a single private key, with a corresponding public address.  
* Build the signed transaction with this public address as the output. (see instructions above)
* Encode the private key as a QR Code that you also include in the envelop
* Write instructions on how to broadcast the transaction and import the private key in a wallet

It would rather be something like 10^60 years but yes

This shows that the fee is not a percentage of the transaction, which is nice
@_date: 2019-11-26 10:14:24
they are but for small transactions, though you can still choose 1 sat/B

I'm aware but it's not that simple to build a tx with it, so I built this tiny package.

It does mention that it only implements curve operations.


Although, you're correct this is not production-ready.

He's always been interested in Bitcoin but didn't really understand it... Now I made him create his own wallet with his own private key and he made his first transaction! 
He loves the math that is behind Bitcoin but he's still a bit sceptical about the Blockchain size and the computing power needed to power it.

What you could try to use is Hashcat.  
[Here]( is a tutorial on how you could get your passphrase back.  
If your CPU/GPU is not good enough, you can also rent a Google Cloud Instance or AWS, with a decent GPU.  
I don't think it should take that much time if you already know the details of your password.

You are correct.

You can retrieve your account with an identification verification.  
When you try logging in, when you are required to put the 2FA code, you can click "I don't have it" and proceed with the identification vérification. It might take a couple days though.

This is not bullshit.   
The fee per byte didn't necessarily have to be 480.115 sat/B, it could have been 70 sat/B, which is already more than enough. The size of the transaction was 13611 bytes which means the transaction fee would have been instead 952770 sats, or 0.0095277 BTC, or about $100. That is impressive for a $1B transaction...  
As others have mentionned, the tx fee was probably high to support the network.

Hey Sethbling here, today we'll be running a full Bitcoin Node on Minecraft.
_It only uses a few command blocks_
