Bitsquare is essentially a marketplace, it works well for its purposes, however, most people lost money in heists are traders which need a very high tps.
A payment channel/LN based exchange, however, could well change that.

Well, you shouldn't forget ZKCP, which allows you to pay for the solution to any NP problem trustlessly.

You were talking about economics rather than Bitcoin technology itself. What the investors want is practical predictability rather than technical certainty(and there is no such thing as techinically guaranteed cap after all), he treats the whole Bitcoin ecosystem as a blackbox which protects against inflation, so he can use it as a safe haven asset.
Unlike an alt, which doesn't inherit Bitcoin's userbase,  in case of a contentious HF the strong full node network of Bitcoin will be partially inherited by both chains. In any case, the supporter of each fork will have a large, existing userbase accessible to them. Especially consider right now it's infeasible for exchanges to not support both chains, which also create brand confusion. To an investor a risk minimized strategy would be to invest in both, as he cannot predict which chain will prevail in the end, which he doesn't need to do for the creation of a new alt, effectively breaking the promise of 21 million coins for him. At the end of the day, an alt is just an alt as an investment, yet there is only one Bitcoin, and both chains have a chance at it. Before the result is clear, each chain is not just another alt but a potential candidate for the future 'Bitcoin'. Further more, the originally relatively coherent outward facing resistance to external pressures within the ecosystem will turn against each other, as one cannot risk his chain to lose, thereby making it easier for forces hostile to Bitcoin to divide and conquer.

 &gt;If this is the case, Bitfinex may have began running a fractional exchange as far back as 2014.
It's important to note that while BitGo's segregated wallet system failure is responsible for this heist, it does give users near real-time auditability of their bitcoin holdings with Bitfinex, directly using the Bitcoin blockchain. Therefore I believe it's extremely unlikely that Bitfinex has been running a fractional reserve.

If there is only one user(in which case liquidity requirement would be small), then it at least still has the same anonymity and security assumption of Coinswap, an external observer could not link the incoming and outgoing payments, and the tumbler cannot steal your coins, even the receiver of the payment doesn't know where it comes from. However, the tumbler would be able to tell where has your payment gone to.
Tumblebit mainly improves upon Coinswap when there are more than one user of the service during a certain time period, one user would be indistinguishable from the k other users of the service during the same time period, thanks to the trick of blind signature and the very cleverly designed protocol to leverage it for Bitcoin scripts.

Would be a terrible idea imo.
Our experience on Bitbargain shows that cash deposit is the preferred method of those who obtain their funds via illegal means.
The personal information of a buyer shouldn't be available to a third party, but should be visible to the seller if he so requests, cash deposit would create a transaction that looks like a bank transfer yet the seller cannot refund the buyer when he discovers that the buyer doesn't meet the conditions that have been agreed.
@_date: 2016-08-01 22:44:43


True that, but remember the innovative part is "Peer-to-Peer", which means each node provides service to the network as well as receives it, so we must maintain a network of full nodes at all costs, meanwhile I agree I don't like the idea of Bitcoin being a full on settlement network.


I am taking a slightly maximalistic view here, in that there would only be one coin which will become the ultimate world currency, so that would probably translate psychologically to a significant portion of Bitcoin investors viewing Bitcoin chain forks differently from other alts. Additionally, as effectively all alts came into being after it was proven that cryptocurrency can make you money, we may never have a chance to experience a fair redistribution like Bitcoin again, which makes the Bitcoin chain forks special.(ETC in fact may have a chance as an originally forsaken chain that survives, let's see)


That already happened :/
Still almost all of us are working to protect the one chain atm, it's just we disagree in the approaches that should be taken, those of us who are not here simply for the purpose of disruption and provocation at least.


It's my belief that dissent and maybe even distrust should be cultivated wherever possible, which is what distinguishes us from, say, the other currency, and protect the value of the network in long term, for which some short term sacrifices are acceptable. If everyone likes Core as much as Vitalik Buterin is liked and the big block camp is facing extinction, I would be directing all my efforts into helping the big block cause. 
@_date: 2016-08-21 10:34:22
The early writings of Satoshi confirm beyond doubt that Bitcoin is supposed to work without trusting any third-party, that means you shouldn't believe whatever bullshit people spout at you. These days people take a huge deal about 'decentralization', but much less about 'trustlessness', because it sounds so jackass and unsociable.
But yeah, the real question: can it really work in a 'trustless' manner? My guess is that people are almost always honest to their money. They may have a thousand different preferences, and dislike the status quo Bitcoin in a thousand different ways, but they would be even less happy if Bitcoin is moulded in a way they don't agree with. So they will just 'accept' and use begrudgingly Bitcoin because the current protocol is the greatest common divisor between the majority of all its users.

You simply don't get it, of course nobody said running a compromised OS is no problem, that would be such a strawman.

If this is true, then it would be much easier to get the coins back, everyone worked in Bitfinex can be tracked down anyway.

The blockchain by design is very resistant to rollback, if nothing else. Rolling back one transaction means all the other transactions in the same block and all blocks succeeding it will be rolled back as well, the huge collateral damage ensures that the majority cannot just neglect the cry of a minority and sacrifice them.
The Ethereum DAO fork didn't rollback the blockchain for this reason, instead they persuade all their followers to download a version of the client which hardcoded some financial transactions into the state database to override the blockchain, aka centralized trust.
@_date: 2016-08-14 16:05:41


Or larger since it only covers up to 42BTC.
Look, say if you use 10^5 satoshis' granularity, and cap the maximum amount at 65.536 BTCs, you can cut away about 2/3 of the proof size, which is really non-trivial for small time users. Businesses sending large txs usually worry less about the higher fees they need to pay for.
I am just saying almost all the Bitcoin experts' comments give people the impression that 3KB-ish sans a 20% cut is the absolute best with state-of-the-art you can get and everyone has to swallow it as a sacrifice for better privacy. It's almost the direct opposite of the ethereum way, you guys certainly are the best at keeping us in forever depression, while alt devs throwing orgies of hopium. 
This is probably also detrimental to the prospect of a fork supporting CT since it will raise more than necessary controversies about scalability.

The thing is a huge number of people have  bank accounts, so a simple, direct, bank account to bank account transfer would hardly look suspicious(unless you do certain things, us sellers at Bitbargain has a list of don'ts people compiled with their sweat and money)


Consider the number of people using them in the West, probably any transfer to them would raise a red flag. Also, it wouldn't be very difficult for the banks to completely cut off any financial links with them, we all know they operate with almost total impunity. I mostly view Bitsquare as a doomsday alternative for Bitcoin trading, in preparation for total regulatory and banking crackdown on Bitcoin(same motive drived us to work on TLSNotary, the arbitration technology Bitsquare uses), that's probably where my possible bias comes from.


This is certainly good.

It's more like better auditability than security I think. Each user can check his own balance onchain at a maximum of 1 day's delay. So wrt " take BTC from one user and give it to another when a trade is done." they settle each day and presumably in cooperation with BitGo.But it'a 2-of-3 and the other key is in BFX's cold storage, so if BitGo is not compromised, then perhaps BFX's cold storage is.

I am disappointed, so disappointed. The OpenBazaar devs simply fail to understand the importance of innovation. They are blind to the paradigm shift, and the reality that today you simply cannot build a marketplace product without using smart contracts and launching it as a DAO after doing a crowdsale. The people at OB put helping people to buy and sell stuff as their first priority, which shows how much their thinking is still Bitcoin 1.0. Nobody today will want to buy things other than from Turing complete contract code executed on a blockchain.

Farms can do a huge number of tricks to make you eating the loss. E.g., overloading your miner before their own so it breaks down earlier and there is very little you can do to figure out what really happened. The "moving in" and "taking away" process is also nowhere near as easy as pool-hopping, consider big farms are usually in very remote places. After all, if they can bring your guaranteed profits that easily everybody would be using it right now.
But this is not even the point, the point is if pools 51% attack the network, it's a matter of time before the hashers find out you are not making them money and pull out of your pool(when using GBT it's like an instant), miner-hosting providers can do that for a very long time otoh.

I am pretty sure CSO stands for "Chief Strategy Officer" and Phill doesn't have the expertise to be a chief security officer.
Wrt insider trading, it's kind of hard to distinguish between investment and trading, in the soundclip Phil only admitted to change his positions according to the changes in price, which you can't really stop anyone from doing. What you really want to know, however, is whether he used his insider knowledge to front run his customers, which needs more detailed trading history to prove, and a higher-than-average success rate should suffice for the proof, even if it's plausible to assume he could well be good at trading, as someone with insider knowledge he should deliberately refrain from trading at the best opportunities.
The simplest thing to do would be: just pledge to only change his position at, say the 15th of each month.

The cypherpunk movement was/is extremely important partly because academic cryptography historically has been an extremely ivory tower field, probably somehow thanks to its affiliation with pure mathematics(number theory had for a long time been considered the archetype of something of no practical use). Academic cryptographers spent years to produce some earthshaking results which have the potential to change the face of the entire human society, but they would rather spend more of the rest of their time improving the result from basing on the random oracle model(which basically means there are hash functions that work), to the CRS model, or even criticizing their colleagues for using ROM, than actually trying to turn their theory into code, or teaching others to do so.The disconnection between academia and industry is so much that at the beginning of this century cryptography only had a niche market, even for those invented in the 70's. It's no coincidence that one of the mottos of cypherpunks is "cyphrepunks write code".
 
Also probably thanks to the relative obscurity and the small size of the cypherpunk groups which mostly flew under the radar, the social change brought by the cryptographic revolution has caught most of the ruling powers around the world rather unprepared.

For pure hodling property, Bitcoin has yet to prove it can be as good as gold, macroscopically.

In countries without backward regulations for the payment industry, Bitcoin can do little to compete with local centralized payment processors, if all the transactions are processed on chain. E.g., Wechat payment processes 10k-50k tps, with peak tps near 100k, not to say probably nobody wants to wait 10 minutes for any payment with value &lt;1 BTC.
If you want Bitcoin to be competitive as a payment system in the long term, LN is the only option we currently know of.

There probably will not be that many txs for which people are willing to wait 10 minutes to process in the entire world. 
And don't expect the great majority of people who are used to instant payments will ever come to use Bitcoin without something like LN. It may look like there is a chance in the U.S, but not for much of the rest of the world, E.g., China's two major payment processors which people use to buy coffees and pancakes process 50k-100k tps, on-chain bitcoin payments will never catch up even if we accept the possibility that we could somehow match VISA in scale, and by that time, VISA would have been able to increase its scale by a thousand folds or so. Why do we think they with their mainframes and clusters and million-dollars database are gonna get outmuscled in the tps battle by our full nodes? And if you accept the idea that we will inevitably end up using datacenter nodes with everyone else using SPV, what's even the point of PoW and blockchain, which are really lousy for this scenario.

At least in theory the Bitcoin holding is much more decentralized than mining, and in practice probably is as well, so hub collusion is more difficult than miner collusion.
And even better, one common Bitcoin user is pretty powerless to stop miner collusion under the current condition, while if censorship indeed becomes reality on the LN network he can take actions immediately-by running a Lightning hub himself.


Much of Bitcoin were not covered by theory in the early days(e.g., no text stated that something like an address will be used, and people will laugh in your face if you mention we are going to use a flooding network which kinda doesn't work according to the traditional theory, yet without which Bitcoin has little censorship resistance) If you are gonna wait before a theory can be fully developed to move forward, well, that would be when authorities can make quicker moves and kill you entirely.

What about bots paying bots to work? State-of-the-art payment processors are going at 50k-100k tps, which suffices for humans and their payment needs. LN, even if it can reach millions and even billions of txs per second, sounds quite pointless. But if you take a step back and think from a machine perspective, it makes a lot of sense, machines work at a much higher pace than humans, only when the monetary system that facilitates resource exchange can run at the same speed, the full potential of machine-operated businesses can be fully realized. Anything on the internet can be rented on demand, at seconds, kilobytes, pixels, thanks to the extreme efficiency of the payment system.

You didn't mention probably the most important reason of all: it's already a mild PITA to maintain a copy of the full blockchain on the hard drive, even more so syncing it constantly, much more so to make every part of it immediately accessible. The situation is going to get much worse if its size would grow 8 times as fast. The bloat of the blockchain size, contrary to many XT supporters would have people believe, does not only affect philanthropic transaction relaying full node providers, but **everyone** who wants to use Bitcoin in its full security! I would go as far as saying if you don't feel a mild headache when you hear the words "increasing the block size", you probably are either really resourceful or have never ran a full node.
The bottomline here is, under all circumstances, people should be expected to pay for the number of bytes they use on the blockchain, given that whether we should increase the block size or not is another question. I know lots out there/including many so-called VCs and Wall Street whales who want to freeload on the storage people render available, but this is simply not sustainable.

Well firstly, more than 50% of the mining power is against BIP101, not just within China's GFW, and Chinese miners are not entirely against raising the limit, but just the BIP101. And in that case, if you think we have made too much concession to the Chinese miners, it would all look like a breeze compared to the effort to convince the global miners at large to accept the limit-raising if Bitcoin mining was indeed sufficiently decentralized.

Yes, Satoshi was...very thorough.
Not only did the hashing of the pubkey provided another layer of protection against possible future quantum computers. He also chose two hash functions to minimize the possibility of backdooring: SHA256 because it was the only one that was widely used/field-tested and have enough strength, RIPEMD160 possibly because SHA-256 is from NSA so one more safety net from an independent source. Both are wise choices IMO.

I thought you were a shill, because no way in hell would someone with the slightest understanding of Bitcoin say anything like this, I was wrong.
FFS, Chinese miners produce 60% of the blocks, the block makers **are** the people who decide what size the blocks they produce is. Accommodate? Accommodate what?
Or if you think you could just fork and ignore all small blocks produced in China, then XT supporters can actually go ahead and start mining themselves, like they always could, but users are always going to trust the fork with the most hashpower behind it, this defines Bitcoin, otherwise an attack would be too easy, anyone, be it a government or a bank or some crackpots,  can just change a few parameters and say that's it, my fork is going to get most of the users, yay!
In fact, simply increasing the cap doesn't exclude the small block miners at all, they could just change the blocksize limit/version value, in theory, but still only include as much as 1 Mb of transactions in their blocks, their blocks are going to propagate even faster thanks to their smaller sizes while other blocks are large, combined with their hashrate, giving them a decisive advantage, and you could do nothing about it.

Bitfury's representative openly bragged about [this]( so I don't think it's just luck. Actually, people were worried about them taking too large a share just a few days ago.
Additionally, not all mining power being represented as belonging to Chinese pools are based in China, lots of non-Chinese mine on the biggest pools, just because they are the biggest pools.

Baby-step giant-step has a presumed 2^128 complexity, because the operation of checking if one of all 2^n elements in the RAM is equal to the value of the pubkey/its hash of the trial private key is assumed to be trivial, in fact, of course for a hash table with a size of 2^128 it's not, not to say 2^128 *256 *2 bits of RAM maybe more expensive than CPUs which are capable of doing 2^160 hashes in a reasonable time frame to begin with.

For big block size advocates/those who are new, Bitcoin is not a freaking charity, if you put your money where you mouth is and pay more fees/do more transactions with fees, miners would certainly be more than happy to increase the block size to include more transactions if they can more than make up for their loss in orphan rate, this is how free market works.

There are basically only two kinds of optimizations you can have:
1. Pollard's rho algorithm, which searches the entire private keyspace and can give you two colliding keys in 2^128 tries, but it won't give you the key corresponds to a specific hash/pubkey, you would instead have two random private keys correspond to the same pubkey(birthday paradox etc);
2.Pollard's lambda algorithm, which will give you a private key corresponds to a particular pubkey in 2^128 complexity, but it requires you to know the pubkey beforehand, which is still not helpful in the case when you only know the hash.
@_date: 2015-06-16 12:18:01
It's amazing to me, when given the opportunities, how many people would think they "know better" than the real market participants, and try to take care of their needs for them, as if the miners cannot figure out the rising/falling demand and adjust properly.

Even if LN cannot be implemented in its full form within a resaonable timeframe, there are quite a few much less complex alternatives which can do much of what LN does, such as Peter Todd's hub-and-spoke and NoRiskWallet(people have had similar ideas for years, very few paid attention until LN). LN is getting most of the momentum behind it probably just because it offers the whole package and is the most sophisticated solution. It seems to me that it maybe reasonable to be pessimistic about LN, but a bit delusional to think this sort of 'caching' technology would not be adopted overtime just because of LN's possible failure, and increasingly handle a large chunk of the network traffic, mitigating much of the need to raise the blocksize.
@_date: 2015-12-24 15:43:02


Even under the extreme condition that everyone uses lightning, the payment channel funding will consume as many bitcoins as would be transferred on the LN. However it does entail the possibility that it would be more profitable/economical for miners to charge fees per satoshi rather than per byte used, which is possibly in conflict of interest with full nodes.
@_date: 2015-06-20 06:44:27
If this is what people would call "conflict of interest", then it certainly almost exists in all protocol developments, including many that are widely used, e.g., TLS, corporations and researchers are free to propose to include the algorithms they develop in the standard, which is not really different from Blockstream's case.(Heck, we even use NSA's SHA256 hash function in both TLS and Bitcoin protocol, who obviously has an active, proven interest to sabotage both). But should we be worried? As long as all the technical merits are out there for people to see, to debate, I would say no. Otherwise in the end we could insinuate almost everyone to have a potential conflict of interest, even for those who are not paid in such a way publicly, they could receive bitcoin payments for advocating certain points of view without being discovered, we're using Bitcoin after all!

One possibility is that there were several people behind the online identity Satoshi Nakamoto, and they only found out later, after the key was created, that none of them trusted each other enough to share a key that will enable whomever in possession of it to speak with the authority of Satoshi to influence the system, so in the end the key didn't get used, to the point that using it alone would be an action exceptional enough to raise suspicions.

LN does not have a proof of receipt sort of thing, the fiat provider could always play the waiting game and deny receiving a LN transaction thus refuse to deliver the fiats, in the hope to gain a favorable judgement from the off-chain arbitrators in the fiat world,  because even in the worst case when the payment channel is about to time out, he can publish the transaction and claim he has just received it, in which case he loses nothing other than from the fluctuation of the currency and the sender would not be able to disprove his claim.
@_date: 2015-06-26 05:59:43
The thing is: if all you have is a hash, your best bet to get the private key/public key is to search through the private key space(or the public key space but in which case you need additional 2^128 operations to get the private key) , and until you try on average 2^160 of them, you won't hit on one right keypair, hash function is indeed helpful with the security.
You may want to stop abstracting things away with terms like "security parameter", and descirbe concrete measures used to obtain the keys from a hash with 2^128 complexity.
@_date: 2015-06-25 09:48:04
But centralization also tends to create hierarchical structures and trust-based networks, adding layers of middle-man directly pushes up the fees.
E.g., a Chinese farmer buying seeds from a U.S company has to jump through many hops, the U.S bank the seed company banks with wouldn't accept credits from the agricultural credit union of the farmer because the credit union could just totally go broke(way oversimplifying here) the next day. Instead, the U.S bank trusts a Chinese-state owned bank, and the state owned bank trusts a provincial bank which trusts the credit union, so the farmer has to root his payment through 3-4 middle men, unless we have a worldwide monopoly of payment processing/clearing house, the efficiency of centralization probably can never be maximized.

It's not just their proclaimed effort to support mining decentralization, their new 40MW data center, which is supposed to be online tomorrow, would put the network's hashrate distribution in a way better state than the status quo. A few megaminers established in different countries, competing with each other, while way less than ideal, is a lot better than a single-nation monopoly of mining, especially when the nation in question is China where the government could plausibly confiscate all the mining power to turn against the network.
And Bitfury's new data center is in Georgia, which is quite far away from the political sphere of influence of both the West and the East.
@_date: 2015-12-16 12:46:18
How funny, Bitfury was one of the pools that [rejected]( BIP101.
And from what I have heard from the XT supporters, the reason they most often cited in favor of big blocks now rather than waiting for things like Lightning to be in place is "We can't wait", are we now supposed to think that sufficient mining decentralization will happen way before the projected high volume of transactions paralyses the network then?
And rest assured, if mining was decentralized, it would be way more difficult to reach a miners' consensus on something like BIP 101 than just convincing a few Chinese mining magnates.
@_date: 2015-12-24 14:18:24


Not everyone likes the inflexibility of locking up large caches of bitcoins for a long time, many people will constantly create and close off payment channels, each of which involves one on-chain transactions that will be "taxed". One may not be so appropriate analogy would probably be Fedwire or some other interbank settlement systems in use today, the low throughput of which, in terms of tx/second, did in no way diminish institutions' need for them/the income of companies running such settlement houses. The difference is just in Bitcoin's case, it has a few more desirable properties, like open access and cryptographic accountability and enforceability of settlement.
Additionally, it's hard to imagine a world where people would not constantly exchange bitcoins into/out of other currencies, and thereby creating onchain transactions, unless it really attains a position of some sort of "global dominance", in which case I expect the base of Bitcoin stakeholders, and thus people willing to mine to support the network, to be much larger.

Only if you have a single dominant party or a collusion, how is a miner on the fence(who solely decides which side he is going to join by going with the majority of hashrate) able to make a decision if he sees two competing chains, neither reaches 50%? We are not even assuming some malicious parties who may want to take advantage of the fork, or active dissenters here.


this is probably most dangerous in this case because problems with handling big blocksize are not going to be visible until after a long time.

We do not need to speculate on the motives of the law enforcement people, which could even be perfectly justified, yet the outcome is still the same-laws no longer have anything to say about what you store or read in private, good or bad, and gradually will lose control of your money movement, not because people speak out people protest people occupy some places people lobby for their rights from the legislatures, but because cryptography has the upper hand. Nothing of this sort has happened for the last several hundred years since modern constitutional governments started taking shape.

@_date: 2014-06-09 14:35:33
No problem.
1.Checkpoints represent a central point of control, so in principle they are not enforced(if you want to create one client without them go ahead),and can be turned off, if you are going to switch to rolling updates of them, then the website/devs pushing these changes to you can itself be compromised.  Meanwhile, the checkpointed blocks included in every Satoshi client release represent a near absolute consensus of the network which we can be highly confident is not sabotaged(they are usually thousands of blocks into the chain), but again, you can turn it off.
2.As you somehow pointed out yourself, once you disconnect from the network for a while, you will become unaware of the blockchain situation, and are technically a 'new joiner', which can happen even out of your control, e.g., your ISP can block all Bitcoin traffic to you for a while.
3.Yes, that's why the risk of a real 51% attack may not be as big as it seems. On the other hand, Bitcoin is serious money so malicious entities will be very motivated to attack any source possible, it will always be wise to stay vigilant and make every effort to build trustless solution I guess.

From the article:“if Bitcoin, or Ethereum, or any other PoW-based platform get to the point where they have similar market cap to gold, silver, the USD, EUR or CNY, or any other mainstream asset, then over a hundred billion dollars worth of new currency units will be produced per year. Under a pure-PoW regime, an amount of economic power approaching that will be spent on hashing every year. ”
I can't agree with this, many years of tech development has shown that power supply can not scale as easily as computing power, or even if it could, you still wouldn't want to stay in a house where energy equates to a small atomic bomb flowing around you, so maybe we can reach a point where just a few tens of billions of dollars of mining power can support a market cap much larger than that, without worrying about any viable attack from several geographically centralized data centers, which are more likely to be constructed by governments/banks.

Tipping, however small amount, serves a useful purpose, to show appreciation online, like it's in RL, seriously.
When you interact with people face-to-face, you can make sure they realize that your appreciation is genuine, by, e.g., raising you voice, nodding your head, smiling, etc, but all of these are not possible online, if someone posts something good, and there are hundreds of commentors replying, asking all sorts of difficult questions, your "thank you" would probably not be noticed at all, without changetipping, it maybe better to not waste your time at all. changetip however, provides an opportunity for this sort of interaction-tipping to make sure the poster is aware that someone is genuinely appreciative, yet at the same time the amount is not large enough to make people feeling awkward, as if they are being paid for the work, which completely changes the viber.
Also small amount tipping can be helpful even when doing crowd fund-raising, when people are not pressured to make sizable contributions, it's arguable that the base number of people contributing can become much bigger which in turn makes the total amount of funds bigger.

Let's assume your conspiracy theory about Tor is true first, then you must realize that what Tor is suffering from is exactly what Bitcoin was designed to solve-the next to nothing cost of setting up a node, the inability of the network itself to curb the Sybil attack kinda forced the network to have some centralized directory nodes which are ready to blacklist malicious nodes at anytime.
Having said that, no defense is 100% effective against an adversary with assumed infinite resources, what Bitcoin does is to make the irrecoverable cost of carrying out an attack against the network as large as possible.
You may have also heard about other people proposing CPU/GPU-only mining, proof of stakes etc, but I think  the irrecoverable costs of doing an attack against them are all lower than one against the Bitcoin.

Some well-connected entities will inevitably become points of contacts, and central points of failures, if you trust but are unable to verify. In Bitcoin's case, I may not write every line of code of the client, but if I know who wrote them, then I can limit my trust to this set of people, I **do not** extend my trust, which in the other case is not true.

It must be because the theft was happening at such a a scale that they have to do something about it.

That depends on what you consider to be a "decentralize exchange". There are, IMHO, two kinds of decentralized exchanges:
* 1.one that does not keep the customers' bitcoins.
* 2.one that does not have a business account which receives fiat deposits, so that it will not keep the customers' fiats and very difficult to be shut down by the banks/govs.
From your post you seem to be mostly interested in the first kind, to run an exchange of this kind is technically quite simple-basically the exchange will act like an escrower of a 2-of-3 multisig address, for the bitcoins escrowed to move to any other address will require the signatures of 2 of the 3 people(the buyer, the seller, the exchange) involved in creating the multisig transaction, so the exchange cannot run with anything alone without the buyer or seller's consent, the technology of multisig is matured and spreading fast.  is one such service.
The second kind is more difficult to be built, as it requires the exchange to be able to prove the occurrence of a fiat transfer without receiving the fiats in its own account, a technology that is developed to solve this problem can be tested out here: note that it's not a standalone exchange, a project that is developing an exchange that can be combined with TLSNotary is here:

But it opens you up to a number of other equally plausible possibilities. Gox, of course, is still fraudulent, but since it knew if a large real buy order is incoming, it can always program Willy to front-run the order to profit, and the real order will only be executed later. We can see correlation in the trading database, but it doesn't necessarily give us the causation.

This time, it looks like the real deal. As the lows and highs are both higher, which have stayed like this for a week. At the same time, the transaction value goes up slightly but steadily, but by no means comparable with the big trading days, giving more indications that the transactions are made up more of the small value ones.
Otoh, it's quite puzzling that the jump took place all of a sudden a week ago.

Chargeback is an extremely unfair system for the merchants, who essentially need to prove themselves innocent or eat the losses in case of a chargeback. Worse still, non-legal professionals from a private company are required by law to determine if a merchant is at fault, under the name of 'consumer protection'.
But I guess many here do not care about the merchants or fairness, as long as they can reap the benefits, and they will complain Bitcoin doesn't provide 'real benefits' for the 'consumers', because it makes chargeback nearly impossible to do.

Actually, this has deep implications for Bitcoin, it means it's possible to prove a bank transfer took place, without any assistance, or even permission from the bank.

Regards escrowing, the platforms acts as a trusted escrower, actually the credit card system has everything in place, delivery signature as a proof receipt, etc, other than the shitty backward "customer gets refund first" policy in place. I mean, what's so difficult to just check the delivery receipt before you release the money?


 Aren't you exactly saying that more protection is given to the customers than merchants, and they are assumed to be innocent, and the merchants are assumed to be 'guilty' until they prove themselves innocent? If it's not unfair, then we should probably throw the whole modern due civil legal procedure out of the window as well.


This is straw man, you are arguing like all current CC customers would have withheld from buying without the credit cards, and they would have also withheld from buying without the chargeback, and the chargeback is eseentially all the protection there is, which is either false(there is e.g., escrowing, and it's not like customers in China, Germany, Russia are not generating huge volume for their online merchants), or laughably unfalsifiable, because guess what, the U.S  mandate on chargeback makes a controlled study as you suggested impossible to carry out. Heck, I am perfectly fine with and would really be happy to see some solid merchants and payment processors offering chargeback options without being forced into it, so we could see how much better they fare against those who don't.

They can't steal your signature, that's the point of digital signature. Your signature is only valid for the transaction you authorized specifically(it will cover everything including the amount and the address to be sent), so the company can't do anything other than refusing to sign on their end, the second attack you mentioned. However, GreenAddress has this covered as well:  they presigned your outputs, but with nlocktime, a Bitcoin script instruction which locks your outputs for a certain period of time, after which you can spend it without their help, in case they blackmail you or disappear.

I am currently just in some sort of a situation where Bitcoin payment could be hugely helpful for me, purely as a customer.
My roommate, who registered for all the utilities and broadband payment account in my flat, has gone missing after he returned to his home country for a vacation and didn't keep up with the payment. Now with my broadband cut off and various bills arriving at my doorstep, I am desperately trying to figure out a way to pay them ,but pretty much all the service providers I have contacted told me that as I can't provide his bank information, I can't pay for him, the only option left for me is to set up new accounts it seems, but even doing that will cause a few days of delay in restoring my broadband connection, also the discount that went into the original broadband deal would have been gone. You realize how much a PITA that is?

1.He can reverse a theoretically infinite number of blocks(other than, probably, those checkpointed into all the clients), however, depending on his real computing power, the time(and thus the resource) it took to double-spend your tx could be made very long, by requiring an excessively large number of confirmations(e.g., BTC-e demanded 100 confirmations for FTC when it was 51% attacked) before delivering the good.
2.The problem is there is few trustless way to tell a **new joiner** of the network whether a chain is promulgated by a malicious entity or not, every channel other than the blockchain itself(forums, ISPs, news sites, etc), is controlled by some certain people, and can be manipulated.
But there is indeed a temporary defense that could work, core dev Gavin Andresen once pointed out here:  that if we can code the client to accept the longest chain where most 'cold' bitcoins are sent(i.e, where all the cool kids before you hang out), we could potentially royally screw up the 51% attacker.

They are a corporation. A corporation is free to do/not do business with anyone they want, this is part of a free market.
There is also nothing, other than economic incentives stopping a miner from rejecting your transaction, if they are forced to accept a transaction then it's called regulation and not free market anymore.

I am not saying a pre-existing node is not vulnerable, some of the newest txs are of course reversible everywhere, merely that if he has a copy of a blockchain, parts of which he believes to be authentic, and is confident that the majority of the network shares such beliefs, he can choose to ignore the corresponding blocks in the larger-difficulty chain that is propagated by the attacker and that's it. In short, POW is used to reach consensus, if for certain txs consensus already exist then it's not needed, and checkpoint is just a mathematical representation of such consensus.

This is one of those lazy, boiler-plate statements that give very little real information and can be very misleading, a noob may think "Okay, I am gonna move my coins off the online wallets, and get a cilent to keep it instead." And he goes to sleep with the illusion that his bitcoins are safe in his own computer, next day he wakes up to find his bitcoins gone, because he happens to use those wallets that do not enable encryption of private keys by default, and even if he does that manually, a computer infested with trojans is still no safer than the servers of online wallets, because your pivate key would still be exposed when you spend. Even Android wallets like Mycelium could not protect you if you use weak passwords, good security practice is a system, it's not something newbies can learn overnight.
Well-designed online wallets use p2sh so if any one of the two private keys(one for the client and one for the server) is in the wrong hand, your security is still not compromised, they also use nlocktime to make sure the service provider cannot blackmail you. Services like GreenAddress also train your security skills by forcing you to use mnemonics to create wallets, using such services for hot, not too large sum, always available bitcoins is actually a rational choice.

As for Bitcoin, no matter who controls the network, using plausible current metrics, they still need to burn on average 40-50 tons of coals to mine a block, and the only thing a centralized miner could do that you can't is to destroy his own business, after spending hundreds of millions of dollars on it first. No, he **cannot** selectively censor a transaction, which is what the banks do all the time.

Another similarity could be drawn between Bitcoin and OSS is the bargaining chip value of the underdog.

Reason: check for yourself, download the extension, open the crypt.js file, lo and behold, they are using RC2 for symmetric encryption. This is simply unacceptable in this era.
The RC2 seems to be called from a minimalistic TLS library called forge, which has implementations for other cryptos, however, since the developer clearly showed a lack of care when it comes to crypto, and forge's crypto implementations have not been well-tested/reviewed, I would still recommend against it even with manual setting of encryption algorithm.

If you multiply 1J/Ghash by the total network hashrate atm（270,000,000 GH/s), it will give you 2.7 x 10^8 J /s=2.7 x 10^8 W, in one year's time it's 2.7 x 10^8 x 365 x 86400 = 8.51 x 10^15 J
According to the data here: 
in year 2013, the world consumes about 20,000 TWh of electricity, which works out to 2x10^4 x 10^12 x 3.6 x 10^3 = 7.2 x 10^19 J
Divide the network energy consumption by the total global consumption we have (8.51 x 10^15 ) / ( 7.2 x 10^19 ) = 1.2 x 10^-4 = 0.012%, so I am off by a factor of 2, but not much.

When you spend from a cold wallet, you **don't** transfer any bitcoin from it to a hot wallet(in the sense that the private keys are transferred to the hot wallet), this completely defeat the purpose of using a cold wallet, what gets transferred is a transaction that is signed on the offline computer, the hot online computer is only responsible for: (1) creating the unsigned transaction; (2) broadcasting transactions signed on the offline computer, and nothing more.


An appropriate wallet will handle all this for you, through a technology called deterministic wallet, or hierarchical deterministic(HD) wallet, all the bitcoins spent from your address will go to at least two destinations(outputs), one is for the address you want to pay, the other belongs to a "change" address next in the deterministic chain that your wallet automatically create for you, any address/private key is used exactly once, and after your transaction is confirmed it's completely useless to anyone.
About how easy it's to steal your private keys, if you create all your addresses on your offline computer, and have never used them to sign any of your transactions, but only to receive bitcoins, then nearly impossible,  the real danger for your cold wallet bitcoins is involved in the process of moving a unsigned transaction from your online computer to your offline computer, when a trojan could jump on the storage media you use to move the transaction data to try to steal the private keys on your offline computer.(for this tricky operation people have came up with all sorts of methods) If you keep your private keys on your online computer, then an appropriate wallet will have them encrypted, and as in the case of cold wallet, the period between your private keys are decrypted to sign the transaction and have it broadcasted will be when you are most vulnerable, **as long as your encryption password is strong enough**.
One last thing: never handle/touch/read your own private keys without going through your wallet, if you don't 100% know what you are doing. Whenever you see your own private key, you have already crawled out of the trench, and into the no man's land under the hackers' machine gun fire, a proper wallet will make sure you don't do the stupid things, I haven't used Electrum often, but from all I have heard it seems to do fine.

One big difference is people all over the world can already communicate with English, while banks all over the world.....what's their shared protocol?
E.g., To transfer a certain amount  from a bank in nation A to another in nation B is full of uncertainties, you don't know (1)what intermediaries it will go through; (2) the fees they will charge you; (3) the time it took for them to process your transfer. And most importantly, what regulatory checks/other types of random checks you will be subjected to, you are supposed to be kept in the darkness by the laws and you never know when you will hit a wall.
The banking system looks like it's working simply because the elites leverage all their mights and resources to back it, alternative solutions could have been much more successful given a fraction of such support.
Also that comment completely misses the point: it's about money, not some language barriers which can be overcame with a bit of communications in other forms.

How is it solved? You think they are going to build powerplants for themselves? Or I guess you haven't realized how much electricity the network is already consuming? At 1J/GHash the network is consuming about 0.02%-0.03% of the world's total power output. If it raises another ten-fold, probably no non-government entity will be able to create a facility that can 51% attack the network. If it goes up another ten fold to 2%-3% of the global power consumption(not entirely unreasonable, the aluminum smelting industry consumes as much without making much contribution to the GDP), even a government cannot pull if off without doing terrible damage to the economy.
Also note that building a powerplant is not practical as I already said, electricity is a scarce resource which takes very large investment to generate but its marginal utility is limited as long as everyone has some so it's not a profitable business.

Most people also do not, at a first glance, have reasons to use a Linux desktop, consider that Windows is pretty much pre-installed everywhere, yet Linux now has something like a near 1% of all desktop userbase. And hell, I would be terribly happy to have 1% of the world's population using Bitcoin.
So why do people use Linux after all? One reason is I think, that they don't want to do lots of things on Microsoft's terms, using Linux gives you complete control. The other is to utilize it as a bargaining chip against Microsoft, this is exactly why many tech companies invested in Linux kernel development in the first place, and why people donate to an opposition party that is hopeless to win an election.

One important thing to note when you talk about this sort of things is that not all quantum computers are born equal, whether they can be successful at cracking your cryptographic protection, depends on the number of qubits that can be squeezed into this crazy-ass state called quantum entanglement, technically quantum computer already exist in the labs, but  they can only manipulate a few qubits, and thus doing only pathetic calculation like factoring 21 into 3 and 7, to put even one more qubit into the entanglement is a great achievement that warrants a bunch of Science and Nature papers, to double the number of qubits available would require decades of huge investments, hard, persistent work and technology improvement.
Now, for a QC to become a viable threat to the network, hundreds of qubits in entanglement need to be prepared, at that point, what would be our best strategy? Well, just double the length of the ECDSA private key used could royally screw the attackers up, at a cost quite manageable(twice the ScriptSig length), giving us ample time to migrate everyone into QC-resistant digital signature algorithm like NTRUSign, or Lamport's signature while they chase us.

After an enough number of confirmations it's not reversible for anyone who downloaded the blockchain while there was not a 51% attack, e.g., if some attackers more powerful than the entire network start to 51% attack the network right now, and trying to reverse Satoshi's tx to Hal Finney, you could choose to ignore such a block  because you know it's bogus, 51% attack is only 100% effective against a new joiner joining the network while the attack is ongoing.

1. The fund is always spent by signing your transaction with you private key, but you don't need to remember the key at all, the software that does the signing for you will take care of that, you only need to remember the passphrase, you can't/shouldn't remember the private key, it's not really for human to memorize cause it's random, and to put down it somewhere, without the protection of the encryption, is dangerous!
2.Again, you don't/shouldn't memorize the private key, but only the passphrase also in this case, but in this case, your passphrase will be as random(read: as difficult to guess for an adversary) as your private key, as it's basically a human readable representation of  your private key, so unless you are really really confident with your memory, do not use brainwallet, or use some addition protections which are a bit tricky.

This may seem high, but keep in mind that, compared to many other resources, electricity is actually quite cheap, the aluminium smelting industry is conusming 3% of world's total electric power, at a cost of something like 30 billion dollars/year, so 0.01% of world's total electric power will cost about 300 million dollars, at the current price , about 700 million dollars are spent on buying newly-mined Bitcoins each year, so I would say power cost is not that big a concern.

However, the coin movement could still have been done by an attacker, the 0.001 btc withdrawal could be a message a trojan sent to its master to ask if the address is under his control, the 0.0009 btc reply is then its master's confirmation.

I always oppose to the so-called distinction between consumer and business, such a distinction is what the fiat system and the consumer society culture impose on us, everyone should/will have a chance to become a 'business', if you have something in surplus(which will almost inevitably happen in one's life), the best way to deal with them is usually, to sell them to those who need it, instead of binning them.
If you look at, e.g., China, where the friction for running a online shop and accepting payments, thanks to Alipay, is much much lower than in the West, all kinds of small-time businesses flourish on platforms like Taobao(it's estimated that there are more than 10 million registered online shops on Taobao alone, which provides jobs for tens of millions of people who would otherwise probably be unemployed) People will be very willing to run their own businesses once the payment barrier is removed.

I am sorry, but if you're still talking about them as if they are two distinct groups of people, you're really lagging behind.
The fact is: there is really nothing super secret about running a business selling stuff, running a corp maybe, but not just a business selling stuff.  Selling is just the other side of buying, in a really free market, everyone can and should become a merchant when they have an overabundance of certain things, it's as simple as that, but the haircut-happy banksters and regulators have turned that into a PITA.
A cheap, irreversible, accessible escrowing-supported payment system could really do wonders, look at what Alipay has done for China, it's estimated that C2C platforms that use it have created more than 10 million jobs, China's unemployment problem would have been much more serious without it.

Admittedly, the fiat funding will probably always be slow, and through traditional channels, however to prove the transfer happens, it's technically not necessary to have a centralized account. TLSNotary can prove a transfer directly from the buyer to the seller took place, without accessing the buyer's login credentials or MITM his connection to the bank:  basically it splits the creation process of the SSL premaster-secret into two parts, so that the auditor will be solely responsible for creating the part that generates the server HMAC key which ultimately verifies the traffic as coming from the bank, you can read the algorithm whitepaper to find out more.

The 250k address and two other addresses which formed part of the tx that moved out the donation fund later formed a new tx, so they most probably are controlled by a single entity, those two addresses were later reused in a tx that spent 125k of the 165k, after the two 10k output that Mark used in the 432k tx.

Two things I think worth bringing up:
1. common folks in the West generally hate math and don't want to learn bout it, combined with the dilapidation of public math education, people struggle with anything that requires math, even at the basic level. 
2. The elites cater to this need of people and build a financial system fully based on trust, while perpetuating the idea that you don't need to manage/understand your own money(which requires math) and should have pros handling it. Overtime people became reliant on the system, and of course, Bitcoin, being an antidose and antithesis to all this, is going to cause repulsive feelings among people, much like how you feel when you stop taking drugs for the first time in many years.
In short, it doesn't feel really good for many to swallow the red pills.

About the trading volume: I think it's possibly the other way around, one could argue the declining volume is a sign that Bitcoin has became more mature, or more like a currency, which is not traded in very large volume. Daily Forex volume for all USD-pairs is something like 20 billion dollars a day, hardly a fraction of all USDs in circulation. Also trading has became more distributed, all exchanges taken together I believe we are looking at 15,000-20,000 BTCs per day(excluding China), if we add that to  about 5,000-10,000 BTCs used in other businesses daily(which I believe is a reasonable figure), we'll have about the same figure as when Gox dominates the market.

Again, not 100% effective under an attack!=not vulnerable to an attack, at least that's what I intended to mean, if there is one tx you can't reverse it's not 100%.


Not 'has' but 'had', it makes a lot of differences, at the time the block was mined, there could just be no competing chain at all, also lots of other reasons, maybe trust-related, could compel him to believe it's authentic, e.g., he hadn't heard of an attack when the block was mined, but regardless, it's not important, the important thing is he has full knowledge it's accepted by the majority of Bitcoin users, for a long time.


For the older part of the chain the client ignores it by default already, in the form of checkpoints.

You deserve to get downvoted, because you are not just comparing apples to oranges, but oranges, bananas, and beef steaks all at the same time.
e.g., when it comes to paperworks and hassles you compare WU with Bitcoin exchanges, but when it comes to risks you compare it with localbitcoin transactions, now if you decide to take the risk to bring lots of cash to a meeting with a stranger, you may finish the money transfer nearly fee-free, and of course paper-work free. I, e.g., would be very willing to buy/sell Bitcoin for cash at the market price, since it spares me the trouble of wiring money into exchanges as well. 
Also, your estimation of the exchange fees are not correct, most major exchanges' fees are nowhere near 1%, and many of them don't charge you for withdrawing if they have charged for trading.
The statement "Send actual USD. Input $100 in the system, and pickup $95 on the other side anywhere in the world is also factually incorrect, WU fees vary a lot depending on your destinations.

Imagine one day, an asteroid did strike the earth and paralysed all communcations, internet and all cryptocurrencies networks stopped functioning, after one year or so, human beings finished rebuilding the infrastructures and decided to reboot the cryptocurrencies, but they faced a difficult problem, how can I tell which blockchain to use as a starting point? For PoW currencies, as long as one copy of the authentic chain existed, the holder of that chain can just show everybody his chain has the maximum difficulty built in it, and everybody would believe, and started mining on it. A well-funded attacker maybe able to double-spend transactions in the last blocks, but to reverse the entire chain in a short time is next to impossible. For PoS, there could be an infinitely many version of **entirely different** chains, all of which took basically nothing to create, and people would be unable to tell.
Now what about the stakeholders, can they have a say here and point to their own transactions? Maybe, but remember it's the internet, and when one speaks, you don't know if he is a human or a bot, a malicious attacker could just create millions of sockpuppets, all of whom confirming "he" has a transaction on a forged chain, any newcomer would still be deceived, remember, all these coins on this chain could belong to the same person whom is ready to dump them on the newbies.

You cannot scale power supply and cooling as easily as you can do with computing power, in fact, it's **so** much more difficult.
Electricity is a **scarce** resource, everyone gets some but one entity cannot get as much as he is able to pay for it, that's why decentralized mining makes economic sense.

And lots of banks from other countries participate in U.S Fed's clearing house, but the problem is exactly there are many houses and you don't know what's going on elsewhere, so you need trust to be in the club, trust requires status/capital, which costs and push up the transaction price.

I guess you are from U.S or a similar nation, as many of the advantages you list here simply make no sense to the majority of people in the world, firstly fiats issued in most nations are not accepted in other nations, heck in UK Scottish pounds are de facto not even accepted in England! 
About so-called 'consumer protection' I assume you are talking about the chargeback which is completely unnecessary and not worth copying, e.g., Alipay processes trillions for hundreds of millions of people in China each year and is what makes Alibaba so strong, what it relies on for 'consumer protection' is escrowing which works brilliantly and escrowing in Bitcoin is only better with multisig.
Ease of use? try sending an international transfer and tell me how easy it's for a Joe Sixpack to figure out the sort code, the SWIFT code, and the IBAN code, not to say that you will not be informed once your transfer is randomly intercepted for anti-laundering check, in which case you have to figure out whom to speak to yourself as your transfer just 'vanishes'.

The 'coins' are just accounting units in a global database/ledger/payroll book that anyone can access, so by definition they **should** represent some values.
Now you may ask lol why do I need to really represent real values with them it's not like I took my monopoly money seriously, coz anyone can create a fancy-looking accounting book and call it the best ledger in the world amirite? No, that's where the contribution of Satoshi and Adam Back kicks in-there are only so many accounting units in the book at any given moment, and to create some new ones you(your computer actually) need to do some real work and there's no way around it as we know, no matter who you are.(this bit is important!) Now if you have really done that much to get them, you may as well exchange them with something of real value otherwise it doesn't make any sense at all.

It doesn't do anything escrowing can't do(heck, escrowing works so well  that tens of millions of Chinese essentially abandon their bank accounts for Alipay accounts and shop everything on Taobao, and I probably shopped the same stuff from the same shoddy websites you described without chargeback), is principally unfair(I am sorry, your argument that you want so-called 'protection' no matter how unfair it's to the other side just doesn't resonate with me), and push the cost of doing business prohibitively high which ultimately hurts the economy itself.

I was talking about P2P solution to the problem, but regarding your question: if you use a centralized exchange like cryptsy, the site operator could potentially link your deposit and your withdrawal together, a way to mitigate it is to use multiple trading sites and accounts, which goes like this: on site 1 sell your btc for ltc, then withdraw your ltc, and on site 2 buys btc with ltc, then withdraw your btc and rinse and repeat, in which case you cannot be linked **as long as** not all exchange operators collude. Also remember to visit the exchanges with Tor, and withdraw at random times with random output values to avoid being linked with just times/values of the transactions.

Many people(including me) just like its flexibility and the freedom to use it in whatever way he sees fit without getting permissions from anyone, the same applies to Bitcoin.
One of the freedom it grants to a Western average Joe is the freedom to stop being a pure consumer and start doing business(of the selling stuff kind) without investing serious time/money/effort in it, this is actually where developed nations are behind China: CC/wire transfer/Paypal simply don't offer the kind of low entry barrier Alipay offers for anyone who wants to do business.

The processing cost for Bitcoin payment is low, as the network doesn't have to afford the  numerous kinds of extra expenses for running a CC company, so you get discounts for paying with Bitcoin, e.g., shopping on Amazon with Gyft points purchased with Bitcoin gives you 3% points back.

That's why I said a 'real' attack, in the sense that miners get no reward for a long time, while at the same time a big transaction gets reversed.

@_date: 2014-11-09 13:20:36
Forgive me if it's obvious to you, it sounds like there are several possible reasons for your problem:
1.Did you include enough fees?
2.If you did, pay attention if someone is trying to malleate your transaction in the good-old Goxy way! Have you checked if your client is up to date and utilize ntxid?
3.In both cases, if the payment doesn't go through, just double-spend your original inputs, until it appears on the blockchain. 
4.Also, it's possible to connect directly to the mining pools and submit your signed transactions there, so your transaction would not be modified half-way.
@_date: 2014-05-12 16:46:17

Ha, we built a program specifically to prove cryptographically if a certain bank statement is authentic:  But the original purpose is to defeat frauds in p2p, dencentralized fiat-bitcoin trading, by verifying if a bank transfer really took place.
@_date: 2014-05-26 18:54:04
It's actually, more or less the reversal of what your parent post described.
For encryption, your encrypt a msg with someone's pubkey, and then the msg receiver decrypts it with a privkey which generates the pubkey, but the privkey is only known to the receiver.
But when signing your tx, you don't know which miner wll process your tx so you can't encrypt it with his pubkey, which can't verify the tx is from you as well. Rather, you apply your privkey to your tx, in some sort of a reverse transformation of the encryption process, which is like 'decrypting' a plaintext, as if it's a ciphertext, and generate a signature that way. You send the signature to the network, along with your pubkey, whoever processes your sig can verify it's truly yours by 'encrypting' it back with the pubkey to see if it matches the tx plaintext you sent, magic indeed!
About the security, we can't say we know it as well as PGP, since PGP often uses RSA, which is very understandable, and in use for many years, while Bitcoin uses EC which is rocket science which the mathematicians/cryptographers agree that really works, but there are potential shortcuts which could be employed by some three-letters agency.(No evidence yet, we use a different curve from that defined by NIST) But in any case, Bitcoin offers a second layer of protection through address hashing, so if you only use each address once, you are very likely to be safe.

The central theme of the programme is Dark Web, so no surprise they made little mention of BTC's other uses.

It's the wrong way to put it, if you attribute the shortcoming of the old system to the human greed, the implication is that it's somehow solvable if there're more competitions.

Typical vbuterin, one sentence to slightly address the main point of the article, then everything else is for making his own point about PoS.
Marginal cost !=total cost in mining, but it's the other way, when total consumption of mining power approaches a percentage of global power consumption, the total cost to 51% attack the entire network would be much higher than the marginal cost. Imagining having to put 10% of your nation's electricity off-grid to conduct the attack, your industries will basically stall to a halt.

Guess what, it's exactly the value of Bitcoin, that we can put these fancy theories into work, to see if they can stand the test of time, that we can verify all the economics we learned from the book, and make it a science.
Let me repeat what has been said by many, Bitcoin is a scientific experiment, it's designed to seek the truth, even if we will fail in such an experiment, it's far from a failure of us, as we still learn a lot more, and greatly expand the sphere of human understanding. It's a much more noble endeavour than blindly follow the snake-oil economics/self-fulfilling prophecy that governments impose on us, which requires no falsifiability, no confirmation by the experiment, but blind belief in authority.

It's important to remember, that we may not have a payment system that is immune to gov attack, but it's more immune then any other such system that exists.
From a technical perspective, it's quite a real danger, but govs also have to weigh their risks against gains, they don't know how we will respond, if we, say give up the decentralization principle and neutrailze their threats using purely social methods(e.g.,  people may lose faith in Bitcoin eventually, but it's also going to harm gov badly, probably more than this mere 5 billion USD-ish market will give them(hey, you declare  war on a civil network, funded with taxpayers' money!) , and the logistical issue they will have to solve.
If our network grows much bigger, to the extent that they really want to kill us at whatever cost, it's possible that mining requires so much electricity that you can't just build several datacenters to launch a 51% attack, as a big powerplant can't even supply enough electricity.

Sybil attack is a threat to any system that works through multiple non-associated nodes, unlike Bitcoin, which relies on PoW to keep sybil attackers at bay, Tor uses centralized directory servers, whose operators reserve the power to delist suspicious relays, like during this [attack]( by CMU researchers.) in which the researchers basically created hundreds of relays to de-anonymize hidden service users. The degree to which such de-anonymzation will be successful, will ultimately has to depend on the percentage of network an attacker can control for an extended period of time without being discovered.(there are about 6000-7000 nodes in the network and to de-anonymize a user at least 2 relays in his path will have to be compromised so you do the math)
Meanwhile, it's important to not make a knee-jerk reaction and ask everyone to abandon Tor, all anonymization solutions's ultimate limit on its capability will be the size of its anonymity set-the number of people using it for purposes governments don't care about, you could have a perfectly anonymous system in which it's impossible to tell one from every other user, but only 100 such users exist, and all of them are obviously in it for something so LEs could just collect RL info on every one of them. Tor is the only anonymous network with millions using it for legitimate purposes, which would make it infeasible for LEs to go after every one, this makes it usually indispensable.
If you don't feel safe about using Tor alone, you could create your own nested-chain of VPN and Tor to distribute your trust, following the advanced tutorial [here]( for Windows users, you could try out Tortilla.

When it comes to international transfers（and to a certain degree, domestic transfers), Bitcoin could probably still be cheaper.
What people usually don't realize is that the banking system is not a monolithic consistent entity, but a network of various entities without much clue about each other, when you send a transfer from Bank A to Bank B, a system like SWIFT only transmits the message of payment, the final settlement takes place in one/several clearing houses, which is merely adjusting the debt/credit position of various clearing house members with respect to each other.
The problem is, the members of the clearing house has no way of knowing anything more about other members' financial conditions(e.g., whether you are in huge debt at another place), so it will require a great deal of trust to join such a club, if you are not a big business nobody will accept you in, there is a great amount of upkeep cost involved for the membership, these costs push up the price to what we see today, especially when it comes to international transfers, and I doubt they will be reduced in the future, as it's fundamental to the trust network.
There are other major difficulties about this system in reality, everyone is boss over his own land and it's simply infeasible to standardize all the legacies accumulated all these years(I mean heck, they are still using COBOL!), I doubt in any foreseeable future the banks can create a globally agreed upon ledger, centralized or decentralized, in fact the status quo is most of the banks probably can't even have their own books agreeing with other books belonging to the same bank.

OP was not talking about DOS.
@_date: 2014-10-18 22:51:12
You would have to first understand what OP is saying, the first thing to do in making it harder for people to track your bitcoins, is to not reuse addresses, rather, generate a new address every time, and receive bitcoins with it. In this way, when people see some bitcoins move from one address to your address, they can't tell if it's still with the same people or have been moved to you, unless, of course, the coins are sent to a place where you are required to be identified, like an exchange. All this will be handled automatically for you if you use a client supporting deterministic/hierarchical-deterministic wallet(what people would call HD wallet), you don't have to worry about it, just provide the address given by your client when others ask for it.
However, it often so happens that when you want to pay for something, there is simply not enough balance in one address(this is not an accurate way of putting it as there is no such thing as balance in Bitcoin but should suffice for now), the client will try to drain "balances" from other addresses, now when people inspect this transaction, they will see that all these addresses balances are drained from are used in the same transaction, so if it can be identified that one address belongs to you, all of these addresses can be connected to you, which greatly compromises your anonymity.
One thing you can do(my point 1) to mitigate this compromise, is to separate your funds into different wallets(you can create many fairly easily), so that those used for purposes you don't mind the public to see and those you want to keep private never mix, and the client will not drain "balances" from your "private" wallet if all funds in the "public" wallet are dried up.
Now we move on to point 2, a common service people employ to hide the trails of their bitcoins is a "mixer", which basically puts the bitcoins from several people into one address, and then separate them again, in this way no one other than the mixer operator knows which coins go to which address. The disadvantages of such a service, however are obvious, the operator could just run with your money, they can be subpoenaed to reveal the trails, you need to wait for enough people to join to start mixing, and using a mixer itself is possibly suspicious enough to be scrutinized by LE. A crypto-exchange, which exchanges different types of cryptocoins, however, arguably do the mixing job better than a mixer. They operate essentially in the same way, as they take your deposit into addresses they control, and later when you withdraw they will send from a unrelated address, they are however arguably more unlikely to run with your money, especially the reputable ones, and their volume is much larger, so you don't need to wait for other people to mix, and trading cryptocoins is a normal activity which LE likely ignores.To mix with a crypto-exchange is simple, e.g., you register two accounts on the exchange, send your BTCs into one, buy LTCs on it, then move your LTCs into the other account's address, and buy BTCs with it, then move your BTCs out, use multiple exchanges and register accounts with Tor for extra security.
Stealth payment is probably not a technique for a newbie(although it sounds cool :)), I will just send you here:   feel free to ask more about it though.
Point 4 is a general rule that whenever you receive or send or move your bitcoins, always try to use the amount people use most often, (e.g., 0.1 BTC, 0.05 BTC), rather than odd value like 0.037258 BTC, e.g., if you deposit this amount into an exchange and withdraw the same amount it can be immediately connected back to you.

Evaluated at 1 J/Ghash, this network is giving away about 200 million joules per second, or 6.3*10^15 joules per year,  which translates to about 150 kilotons of petrol, or 1.5 megatons of TNT, equivalent to 75 atomic bombs that got dropped on Hiroshima in one year's time.
The world's annual electric power consumption is about 22000 billion kWh, or about 7.92*10^19 joules per year, using purely these numbers, the Bitcoin network should be consuming between 0.005-0.01% of world's total electric power. But it's assuming the network stays static, by the end of this year we maybe looking at a number 3 times bigger...

I thought the basis of our understanding is that if they think anything is a threat, they can change the law, if they want to categorize cash as an asset, they can. Yeah think about it, cash actually may appreciate relative to the numbers invented by the banks on your "account", especially during times of crisis.
And if we don't think laws can be easily changed, then U.S is probably the only country in the world to tax the assets of its citizens wherever they are, most countries don't tax assets that are not created under their jurisdictions.

Low price=low reward for the miners, the network hashrate would drop greatly when there was no money to be made, which would undermine the security of the network.
For roughly the same reason, I don't believe any CPU/GPU only altcoin network would be able to survive alone(if there could ever be one), plenty of organizations out there could destroy such a network with their millions of CPUs at no more than ten thousand dollars in cost, Bitcoin just got off lucky because nobody gave it a damn before it was "too big to fall".

Well, repeating myself again, scaling power supply is much more difficult, it's a physics problem that has not been solved despite more than 100 years of effort. Cloud computing is scalable because their computing load is nowhere comparable with Bitcoin mining(hundreds of times larger than all top 500 supercomputers in the world combined), and their electricity demand has not reached the saturation point(actually, one of the incentives for cloud computing is in most of the data centers many CPUs are idling and nearly not consuming electricity).
@_date: 2014-12-03 14:26:55
This protocol is nothing new, it has ben proposed by many people before, and it's also woefully inadequate: the seller has much more at stake than the buyer after he lock his bitcoins, so the buyer can always propose to the seller to settle with other means(say signing a tx spending half of the coins back to the seller without the buyer paying anything, and send it to the seller), the seller rationally should always make the decision of minimum loss, and accept the buyer's proposal. Otoh, the situation completely reverse after the buyer has sent the fiat payment, in which case the buyer would have much more to lose than the seller if they cannot reach an agreement.

Thanks for your interest.
The server HMAC key(which is basically a one-time key signing the bank statement using a hash function), used in authenticating the server traffic to the auditee, is not known to him until he commits the hash of the single bank statement page SSL record, thus the content of the bank page can be checked with the HMAC key, until then solely controlled by the auditor, against the HMAC record, to see if they match, and if not, it can be proven that the bank statement has been tampered.
The reason we are able to transfer the control of the server HMAC key to the auditor, without MITMing the auditee, is that in TLSNotary the master secret is not entirely known to the auditee, the part that transforms into the part of the master key that eventually transform into the HMAC key is created by the auditor through RSA homomorphism， which ensures that he doesn't know any key other than the server HMAC key.
Also note that after commitment the auditee will acquire the server HMAC key which allows him to check the authenticity of the page, before he finally send it to the auditor, thus the TLS security model is not compromised.
For detailed infor, please read the algorithm white paper linked on the front page（we have graphs there also describing the process), or come to ask us in  on freenode IRC.

It must also be pointed out, that big time investors wouldn't just wire millions of dollars to exchanges just to have them sit on their asses, whenever a run was supposedly initiated by Willy, other exchanges followed up almost immediately with huge volumes, ruling out the possibility that it's when people only started to wire their money through banks.

That's a very broad categorization, at least one is not necessarily exclusive of another. In fact, there could very well be a option for turning on/off tipping acceptance, the tipper will be immediately prompted when he tries to tip those who turned it off(threshold can also be introduced) and those choose to not accept the tips would not be bothered with it at all, the tipping could also be sent with only the knowledge of the sender/receiver.

If you can mine bitcoins with your CPU/GPU in your basement, so can the governments/banks, who have millions and millions of them around, not to say how many old chips are in stock in the chip fabs, worse still, they can bitcoins for a while to cover the cost of a 51% attack, then shift the chips to do the attack, finishing the network off, then shift them back to do the number crunching work, without incurring any financial expense.

The miners are free to determine the fee they charge, there is no guarantee that they will include your tx before the others if you don't pay.

Negative 10x leverage at Bitfinex
Buy millions of altcoins on exchanges
Double-spend the exchanges, profit!
Watch coin go down, profit more!
First there is only 3.33x leverage on BFX.
BFX also occasionally terminated trading without executing the orders, you think they are not entitled to do so? Especially when you double-spend them, when by definition your coins as a collateral simply have not arrived in the first place(you violate the contract)...heck, Bitcoin is all over, why should anybody care still? Gox can roll back the trades so can they, they are not really bound by anything other than the prospect of less profit as people flock to other exchanges.
In addition productivity is not measured by the amount of colorful bills you make out of this, you are the government anyway, but if such energy is being used on activities creating real value/jobs. Regardless of if you get some money back from the attack, your economy will still be hurt as other productive activities demanding electricity are deeply impacted.
1-2% of global power consumption is almost 10% of that of the US, loss incurred by such a reduction in power supply, suddenly(as in order to make your manipulation of the Bitcoin market successful the govt should inform no one), will do irreparable damage to the economy, probably in hundreds of billions of dollars, if not trillions, lots of enterprises/factories making up the economy must simply close down.

Many above me have addressed the privacy issue.
When it comes to security, the private key of an address you use to receive bitcoins can remain completely isolated from the network, so hackers have no way to get it, while the private key of an address you use to send bitcoins has to be exposed to the network in one way or another.
So when you never reuse your private key, the time window for a hacker to steal your bitcoins is very short:if his trojan cannot grab the private key of your sending address before your tx is confirmed, then it will be of no use to him, as all of your bitcoins have already been moved elsewhere, if you reuse your address however, then he will be allowed a much longer time to try.

Again, at saturation point(the network consumes 1-2% of the world's total electricity) the total cost in terms of fiat simply doesn't matter, regardless of the amount of money you put in, the world's electricity output won't change much（if electricity generation could scale with the investment China would be so happy!), 1%-2% of it being taken away for something completely unproductive will make a very painful dent to anyone's economy.


According to the study here: the data centers worldwide would have probably consumed about 2% of global electricity, to have them accomodating 1.5% more doesn't seem very feasible to me. But more importantly, if you have to outsource your mining to them, they would consume probably significantly more since they are not purposefully built for mining, and this is under the assumption that all the world's govs unite in a crackdown on Bitcoin and all the world's data centers comply in giving resources, as much as they can be paid for and the rigs in all these datacenters can be managed as one(i.e., nothing goes wrong/offline in the process of a several-days long attack), which I think is a ridiculous assumption. 
If the govs go the other way, building datacenters themselves, which have to be on uninhabited lands, that means building **new** power supply lines, which in the case of building 100 data centers would cost much more than just building one data center, also cooling infrastructure, roads to the data centers, all have to be built, adding to the cost.

Hello. 
Your bank, and any server that supports SSL/TLS, technically signs your webpages already, with HMAC, the problem is that anyone tries to verify a HMAC signature needs to know the key used for signing as well, so the client would have the signing key, and after he has it he can forge any page to be "authentic".
What TLSNotary does, is to use a modified SSL stack that allows the client to generate encryption/decryption key, while a third-party arbitrator/auditor will generate the HMAC key in use, so on one hand the third-party cannot MITM the user, on the other hand the user cannot forge the page, as he doesn't have the HMAC key until he commits the page with SHA256, when he can authenticate that the page is not tampered himself.
Hope that can help you understand.

Bitcoin is as unnecessary as internet and smartphone were:

E.g., today I made a withdrawal from BFX's Taiwanese bank to my Hong Kong bank, when the withdrawal arrives, I found out that a 10% haircut was taken from the amount, no forewarning, no explanation, no recourse, no appeal, no information for other cheaper possibilities, nothing, matter of fact, my money is gone, that's it. 3 years ago when I wasn't aware of the Bitcoin, I would probably have said :"Well, that's how it works, running a financial system is not easy, there will be hiccups here and there, and we should forgive them for being too busy to look into that, we should be thankful that we can even send money across countries within days!"

The ultimate obstacle stopping governments executing a 51% attack in the future is probably the difficulty of centralizing power supply and  cooling, not the cost of purchasing hardwares, I think Vitalik has always missed that point.
E.g., at current Ghash/J rate, the network is consuming about 0.01% of the world's electricity, if this percentage increases to 1%(not that far-fetched since it costs the aluminum smelting industry about 20-30 billion dollars to consume 3% of the world's total electricity output), a bit back-of-the-envelope calculation will show that the governments will have to build city-sized data centers to carry out a 51% attack without chips melting down, not to say such power being allocated for something completely unproductive will do huge damage to the economy, and the cost to build the power transportation structure.
Unless we have cheap fusion power of course, that's another different story.

@_date: 2014-11-08 12:32:40
The following, roughly, is what happens:
1.You client first searches the blockchain for a list of 'outputs'(think of them as piles of bitcoins) that are signed by the previous sender as being sent to you, as the signature would include your address, nobody will be at doubt they now belong to you. Note, one address could contain many piles of bitcoins, think of it as a wallet with many notes with different face values, but you will normally only get to see the total value in this particular wallet if you don't dive into the blockchain, such a wallet in Bitcoin jargon is called an address, a multi-address combo in Bitcoin is called a 'wallet' instead, you will get used to it.(if you haven't)
2.Your client then combines enough of these piles to create a bigger pile that contains just enough bitcoins to pay your beneficiary, then it signs the value, the original piles create it, and the destination address's public key with your private key, so anybody can verify that you authorize the destination address to receive your bitcoins, just as those who sent them to you did, this is your(unconfirmed) transaction.
3.Then you broadcast/shout to the world, that your transaction is coming, all the full nodes in the world than forward your transaction to everyone they connect with, including miners, in about 10 seconds time, nearly every miner in the world should know you need to do this transaction, then they verify that you indeed sign/authorize your beneficiary to receive these bitcoins that up to this second indeed belong to you, and put it in their memories, and carry on mining.
4.Now why do they mine? Because we expect there to be only one version of the ledger recording every transaction, if there are two versions, you can show one person one version of the ledger, convincing him you have this much money to pay him, and after you pay him, you show another person the other version of the ledger, where your last transaction is not recorded and your balance remains the same, so she will accept your payment as well, until someday they meet and figure out your trickery, but by then you will have already run off with their goods. Now since this is the one and only ledger/blockchain, at any time there must be only one entity in charge of writing it, but what's the fair way to decide whom to write it? Satoshi settled on using a mechanism called "Proof of Work", that is, every miner(accountant) gets to solve a math problem in 10 minutes or so, whoever is the first to do that, will get to write the page of ledger for these 10 minutes, along with some BTCs as his reward, also the problem is designed so that those who compute fast will have a higher chance of being the first, but no one will get the monopoly, everyone has a chance to hit the jackpot, with the chance dependent on his computing power. The difficulty of the problem will also adjust depending on the total computing power of the nodes in the network.
5.After a while some lucky dude finds an answer to the problem for the current difficulty, and he decides to include your tx(maybe you paid a decent fee) in his page of the ledger(block) and publish it, all the miners in 10 seconds will get his block, as long as none of them has solved a harder problem at this point, they will continue to work on his block(yeah his answer and your transaction is part of the next problem, that's why it's called a chain and how your transaction also gets into everyone's book), because they know, that's the chain everyone will recognize, since the ledger that contains the answers to the most difficult problems, is the one that will stand out be considered most reliable, as there is no other way to tell which of a possibly myriad of chains is legit.
6.Now your beneficiary can verify that your bitcoins to him is included in the most difficult blockchain, the one with most computing power behind it, he will feel safe and let you collect the goods.

Except that such a system can never be global(in every sense), since they cannot really decide. Banks today are politicized institutions, unlike Bitcoin miners, they will not agree on a block based on max difficulty condition and that condition **only**.
E.g, Russia wants to transfer money to Syria, and they submit the transaction. U.S and Western bank nodes say no no, Russian and Chinese nodes say yes yes, in the end nodes on different sides cannot agree and accept different versions of the block and the network split, and no one will use a network that constantly splits.
And we are already assuming the exact initial distribution of  'premined' debt tokens(aka fiats) banks transfer over the network is a problem that can be sorted out(e.g., nobody knows if the debt relation between a Zimbabwean bank and a Botswanan bank is as what they claimed), unlike bitcoins, for which you can track every single one back to its origin.

If anyone would like to help, we recommend you to use the "self-test mode" built in the program, to test the compatibility of the logged-in area of your online banking account, by, e.g., recording your profile page and see if the session conclude smoothly. Nothing in the self-test mode is passed out of your computer as it's just messaging between two instances of TLSNotary on your own computer essentially. Once you have the results or the errors, you can report to us by...I don't know, E-mailing us at tlsnotarygroup-at-gmaildotcom submitting a post on our forum thread or talk to us in the Freenode IRC channel  yeah I knew we should have something proper long ago, but there hasn't been much interest in our project really.
BTW it's worth emphasizing that there is absolutely no risk of password leaking under any circumstance by using TLSNotary, if you don't specifically ask it to audit the password input page yourself, at which point TLSNotary should not even have been started. The new protection we build is for eliminating the risk of MITM attack(i.e., middle-man knowing your TLS encyrption key and thus able to disguise as you to make transactions).
Of course, you certainly would like to know if our claims are justified, then read the code, everything is in Python and JS, it pains us greatly to ensure that binaries are not even used in the distribution of TLSNotary.

Nah, they don't, the first 2-of-2 uses nLocktime and after a certain time the funds must be refunded to the buyer. And the second 2-of-2 comes out of the expense of the payment processor, so the merchant risks no fund of his own.

There is no free lunch in this world, and nobody here is saying that Bitcoin needs no confirmation anymore.
Both the buyer and the payment processor are expected to store quite a few transactions' worth of coins in the multisigs, which makes it suitable for the kind of small unit price, large volume business that arguably needs instant payment processing more than anyone. For the buyer, the multisig could just be used as a greenaddress-style p2sh wallet, which carries little risk for him thanks to the nLocktime refunding tx which stops the processor from blackmailing him.
However when using a payment processor the buyer may want to have more flexibility with his funds than with a wallet service, for this you should read the "reopening paychans" in the impulse.is paper to find out more.

A case in extreme is suppose no miner will mine any tx then whatever blocksize increase doesn't make sense. Then you can see that it's not logically correct to damage the capacity and ask for it to be increased at the same time.
Oh btw, Antpool just mined two empty blocks  on top of their own blocks,  " not to work on invalid blocks, and hence no hash power is wasted."? LOL.
(Note that I am specifically calling out Antpool, I have no problem with F2Pool who despite its owners' unprofessionalism and immaturity and at this point more anti-Core, did seem to make a consistent effort to reduce empty block rate.)

I am not sure what you meant, TLSNotary is for post-facto dispute settlement, the transfer has to be sent first, before the arbitrator is called in to decide if the coins should be paid out.(he is supposed to have the third key in a 2-of-3 multisig which escrows the bitcoins traded) So you are expected to review the transaction history page, as bank statement is used for lots of legal purposes, it's unlikely that banks will allow you to change it at will.

Yet another FUD from some non-sensical journalists trying to put Bitcoin in a bad light.
Egopay is more of a traditional e-wallet service which happens to support Bitcoin than a Bitcoin payment processor, and should have been regulated as any other fiat payment processor, the fact that such thefts happen demonstrates plainly how inadequate such regulations are.
In fact, had Egopay been a real Bitcoin wallet service and used the standard technology used by mainstream Bitcoin wallet providers today, including proof of solvency, 2-of-2 p2sh, and nLocktime addresses, theft like this would have been impossible, at this point in time, we can confidently say Bitcoin wallet services can offer way more protections against inside job than any fiat services can ever dream of without being subjected to the pathetically ineffective and corruptible regulations.

Most payments are paid to a hash(think of it as similar to the address, but not the same) of the pubkey, and the pubkey behind the hash is revealed only when outputs associated with this address is spent. So that means, if you don't spend them(and don't sign anything with them), nobody sees the pubkey, QC can't do anything about it, finding a SHA-256 collision is not something QC alone can pull off. Even when you spend them, as long as you don't reuse the address, your coins are probably safe, because they will get to the miners first, even if an attacker tries to replace them with a larger fee after cracking the pubkey, they need to be able to do it under 10 minutes usually, which is an entirely different level of difficulty from just "being able to do it."
However, all the earliest Bitcoin txs were paid to a pubkey, rather than a hash of it(they use an address but nevertheless are txs paid to pubkeys within the raw blocks), so once an attacker has a powerful enough QC, they could spend years to crack these keys.
@_date: 2015-01-18 11:13:20
I wonder if it would be possible to eliminate even the risk of B(rather than assumed him to be a trusted processor) 's collusion: say B and D open another 2-of-2 p2sh paychan in advance, at the expense of B's coins, which is assumed to be exactly as much as D is about to be paid. When D gets paid from A and B's paychan, D signs a tx that refunds B yet includes inputs from the tx that D is expected to receive, so B wouldn't replace the tx that pays D as he wants his own coins back, does that make sense?

Hmmm...not sure what you meant. The server provides the content is the bank server, and the audited page is the bank statement, which they have to provide unless they shut down the user's bank account, this is not impossible, as TLSNotary doesn't behave entirely like a normal browser(e.g., it only supports 4 TLS ciphersuites (RSA+AES-CBC/RC4, TLS 1.0/1.1), and the PMS(premaster secret) used to generate the keys, looks unusual if the bank server checks specific patterns, as it's created under encryption using homomorphism, what ensures that both the auditee/or can't cheat. The banks can block user's accounts based on these patterns.
Theoretically, all these countermeasures can be circumvented, we have a new algorithm that creates entirely indistinguishable PMSes already in the code, but it's disabled by default as it is firmly in the "roll you own crypto" realm and we cannot turn it on until it's subjected to proper crypto review by an expert, also there is serious performance penalty. In case TLSNotary really gets popular, and the banks decide to throw down the gauntlet to fight us however, I believe there would be enough momentum behind this project to push it through.

Imagine a big time spender tries to open a channel and broadcast his request, you would expect quite a few hub ops try to convince the miners to get their channel opening tx into the next block first so they get the business. One of the ways to do this is for the hub op to pay more fees in settlement than others. So this tx could net miners significantly more income. It's also why you would want to run you full node, you need to be constantly online to be notified of a broadcasted request first.
Of course, all this will only happen when LN really gets widely used.
@_date: 2016-03-10 23:22:11
Without full nodes checking the rules, you would not even be able to detect that miners are inflating the supply, much as how you can't find out the real inflation in the fiat banking system, maybe miners should form a CB which produces some beautiful reports every quarter, who knows.

5 Core devs promised in the HK agreement that they will write a HF patch before July, **if** Segwit rolls out with miners' support. So there can be two possible scnearios: 1. Segwit SF gets 95% and activated, Core devs get down to write a HF patch which will get us into a new round of debate, but mostly among Core devs/supporters themselves, because Classic is hell bent on stopping Segwit, once it's activated it would be considered a heavy blow to the "movement". 2. Due to Classic's opposition or some other reasons, including disagreements among miners themselves, Segwit cannot be activated, then the 5 Core devs will be absolved of their obligations to write the patch, then it becomes a game of chicken with no certain outcome.

@_date: 2016-01-26 14:05:48
"A major problem with simple approaches to increasing the Bitcoin blocksize is that for certain transactions, signature-hashing scales quadratically rather than linearly."
Quadratic-scaling would mean every doubling in block size could allow txs that take four times as much computation to be verified to be created, such txs could be created for malicious(to gain an advantage over other miners or to take full nodes offline) and non-malicious reasons(F2Pool once created a tx that fills an entire block for dust-collection) 
The 1mb tx F2Pool created took 25 secs to verify on Rusty Russell's computer  so I would say for an average node, a 1mb/2mb/4mb/8mb tx would take 15 secs/1 min/4 mins/16 mins to verify on an average node without Segwit, and 7.5 secs/15 secs/30 secs/1 min with Segwit.

Without a contest, and with a long enough time frame, near 100% is possible. That's what the F2Pool's op proposed in the core dev channel, rolling out the removal of the cap first, but not activate it until like a year later, by the miners, to make it a soft rather than hard fork.
@_date: 2016-01-17 20:06:12
I don't disagree in the long term we need to raise the hard cap, but my threshold personally is a lot higher(I am not sure if you were there during the 2013 accidental fork, it was scary), like if 99%+ full nodes indicate that they are ready to roll.

Nice try at mixing fictions with facts, even if most of the Bitcoin exchanges are unregulated(which they arguably are not), none of them is decentralized, or this risk would not have existed.

QC's workability, unlike AI, depends on a few very well known physical parameters.
Also about the possibility of NSA(or other organizations)'s capability to develop QC, you may want to read the section 4 of [this paper]( "The Snowden revelations suggest that it does not. According to an article
in the Washington Post [48], the NSA’s efforts to develop a quantum
computer are a part of a US$79.7 million program called “Penetrating Hard
Targets.” This is a very small fraction of the NSA’s budget. If the NSA were
close to developing a practical quantum computer — or if they believed that
another nation was — then they would be devoting far more money to this
project. The article [48] concludes that “the documents provided by Snowden
suggest that the NSA is no closer to success [in quantum computation]
than others in the scientific community.” I find this argument to be rather convincing, besides, 10 years is really a rather short time from a national security perspective.

I wonder if we can remove this trust on the operator, by having the operator and the merchant setting up another 2-of-2 multisig in advance. The multisig will escrow about as much bitcoins as the merchant is expected to receive from its customers in a reasonable timeframe. Each time the merchant receives a payment from the paychan of the payer, he signs a tx(must be transmitted to him and signed before the operator signs the tx that pays him) that refunds the same amount to the operator's address, and using the outputs of the unconfirmed payment tx as some of its inputs, so the operator would be discouraged from participating in double-spending?

Okay, since we are talking about max paranoia, I am gonna totally ignore your convenience.
1. Do not mount your storage media, your OS should be modified to do just that. Instead, use dd to write into/read from your USB or preferably a CD-R to safeguard from a infected USB firmware, in the raw mode, assuming you use Linux for your cold storage, which you should.
2. Segregate your private keys into multiple wallets, each encrypted with a different password, only decrypt just enough wallets to provide the amount needed for the transaction.
3. Use something like Tails/Knoppix/customized distribution, so each time you reboot, it's a fresh install, along with 2, it will make sure the most a Trojan can compromise are the private keys you just decrypted to do the transaction, and you would be aware of such a compromise when the transaction is published.
Additional paranoia can be achieved, by booting with a Live CD/USB Linux distribution on the hot wallet machine to do the transactions, and turning off all ports that are not strictly necessary for running Armory/bitcoind.
@_date: 2015-01-15 23:20:42
Yes, it's their representative here.
@_date: 2016-01-20 22:45:15
1. You have no majority, it's just a make-belief. Bitcoin is far larger than you imagine, counting exchanges alone there are hundreds of them globally, expect them to all get prepared and upgraded within a narrow schedule stretches belief. Counting the number of full nodes, which every user really relies on to know if they are on the right chain and thus avoid double spending, you don't have more than a few.
2.  Even if you really have an "overwhelming majority" the phrase you oh like to use it so much, you still should not push for a hard-fork, because any unupgraded node would not accept the larger blocks, and it's almost inevitable someone relying on these nodes to confirm their transactions would end up getting double-spent, as both theory and history show. In the 2013 accidental hard-fork due to a database bug, the overwhelming majority was indeed with one chain, yet OkPay(you even knew they use Bitcoin? Further reinforces the point you have no idea what the majority is thinking) still end up getting double-spent, though fortunately it was benevolent. So unless the core full node count goes down to negligible level(i.e., single digits), a hard fork carries high risk to cause real monetary losses for people. But judging by responses to me from many big blockers, they apparently could live with such man-made disasters as long as they get the bigger blocks they want.

Huh, if you spend a lifetime in a town, or like me, under a rock in the middle of nowhere, then true, cash alone wouldn't give away a paper trail, but if your movement is limited to one small place cops probably already know all about you.
If you ever want to move anywhere, like, e.g., carrying a load of cash on a car, then cops can intercept you and just confiscate your cash, at least in the U.S, so-called "civil forfeiture", not to say if you want to bring those cash out of your country you are guaranteed to be examined very thoroughly, and carrying lots of cash for buying anything is always very conspicuous. So yes, cash is, in theory, anonymous, but in reality it's completely another story, the sort of stuff NSA likes, giving you a false sense of security which they can easily bypass with other measures.


If you are so keen on obeying the law(whatever the law is), the same theory applies to cash as well. You will have to keep receipts of all your cash transactions.


The govts effectively own more percentages of any other assets you can think of, also the moment Satoshi moves anything without an explanation, everyone will notice, and heck, there are always other blockchains we can switch to. Also, the conspiracy theory that NSA will create something with so much effort because they are confident that it's doomed for becoming a dominant global honeypot stretches human belief. NSA are not some crazy geeks who believe a currency can take over the world just through its technical merits.

If you want my opinion on this(being Chinese), my speculation based on information gathered from Weibo and Wechat is:
1.About the hardfork, they don't like Core's approach but also don't want to push Toomim's agenda, especially his schedule, to activate on March 1st simply defies rationality, so each one gets a slap on the wrist.
2.It's also possible that this is simply a delaying tactic, as two large pools are absent, and could remain ambiguous all the time, the threshold may just never be reached due to the tacit understanding between those signed the consensus and those did not, this so-called resolution would therefore become an empty check;
3.There is communication problem across the ocean through out this crisis, Chinese miners appear to wrongly estimate the core devs, they seem to think that core devs are bidding to retain their control of the codebase, many also buy into the Blockstream conspiracy theory, there is some misplaced hope that core devs will come around after realizing the risks, having never spent anytime dealing with the core of the core devs(people like gmaxwell, sipa, laanwj), they fail to realize that the objection is based on both ideological ground and technical considerations.
4.Segwit simply overwhelms the Chinese miners, many of whom were programmers yet without background of security engineering thus unable to assess its complexity, we are also fortunate to have a group of people who are able to engineer complex cryptographical technology at unprecedented speed, so there is really no reference.
You don't really need to read too much into the article itself, which was written by someone with a clean pro big block anti-core bias and not part of the "consensus", the consensus is basically two sentences in bold fonts:
1.That Bitcoin blocksize needs to be increased to 2MB;
2.That hard fork without the support of 90% of hashpower will be opposed.
Otoh, you did make an interesting point that I never realized, but I have yet to see evidences supporting it.

[Useful site]( for checking on the nodes version, it's pretty funny to see there are some 0.6-0.7, probably abandoned nodes still going online occasionally and desperately trying to sync in vain. However, the number of pre-fee reduction 0.8.* nodes which are still actively syncing are probably worth more attentions.
Ethereum did a HF a few days ago, which kicked about 1000 nodes off the main chain, however being a network with no monetary activity and under strong central leadership, they probably don't care that much.

No, I would rather them spending time looking after the code that takes care of my money, they should not waste their precious energy to please people online(it's not like they are impolite or unwilling to help, they just don't please!), thank you very much. 
Core devs are risk-averse, conservative and paranoid, that's part of the job, and the mentality we should expect them to have.
Instead, somebody should really hire someone to help with all forms of communication from the Core, this is one of the most important pieces of code on the planet, and it rightly deserves one.

Heh, I don't need you telling me that, I was present on all those occasions.
The 2013 hard-fork was accidental, yet in the 6 hours of chaos, somebody managed to double spend the OkPay, that's what damage a hard fork, however short, is able to do.


None of them were even remotely this contentious, frankly, when P2SH and CLTV and other stuff got rolled out, I was like:"How the hell can these people procrastinate like that?" But jokes aside, it pretty much makes the point the time it takes to prepare for such changes.

Usenet e.g., has existed for 30 years in pretty much the same form, it is continuing to exist despite long stop being the mainstream form of online discussion, for me Bitcoin is the same, I used it for 5 years just fine, if the choice to be made is freedom or losing it and becoming mainstream, I would rather choose the former.

Well, as you said you really need to compare  the **cost** of hashing rather than the market cap. Hype can go a long way to inflate the price but it doesn't mean the network becomes more secure, and once an attack really starts the value will drop a lot. The 2013-2014 Bitcoin had a higher price/market cap but the network security was significantly lower.
51% attack the ethereum network is basically 10k top video cards which add up to about 8M-10M dollars, given their current Ethash rate.

Haha, it's also well known that once people become miners they start to become very aggressive :P


This is really the problem, a significant number of them do seem to believe that the support of hashing power is the deciding factor of whether a chain will emerge "victorious". Others do agree that economic majority is the deciding factor, and miners can only follow economic majority, yet fail to crystalize this understanding of economic majority. They seem to subconsciously limit the economic majority to the Americans as much as Americans do, while ignoring the rest of the world(e.g. do we know what side people who speak Spanish or Japanese are on?), which amazed(albeit only a little bit) me.

My definition: there could be thousands to tens of thousands of full nodes on the network, consensus means that the remaining number of unupgraded nodes is in single digits.

That has a lot to do with the facts that most of the competent devs choose to work on Bitcoin, why would you want to work on altcoins if you can work on Bitcoin? so altcoins usually get the bottom of the barrel. The few altcoins with decent devs, are relatively successful(e.g., Ethereum).

As normal users we can just do wishful thinkings all day long, optimism is something keeps Bitcoin alive. But otoh I am not going to trust my money to the code written by a bunch of blindly optimistic coders even less conservative than me, woh are crazy enough to think with "75% of miners support" they could just go ahead and push the fork. Bitcoin is security-maximum code, because any small successful compromise of the program could lead to what Kaminsky termed as a pot of gold directly stealable at the end of rainbow.
Such lack of concern about users' properties is a strong sign to not touch whatever they produce with a ten-feet pole.
I don't agree with people like gmaxwell on the blocksize issue, but I am much less willing to push for a fork unless there is absolutely clear strong consensus(e.g., participation of almost all full nodes) and the support of competent devs. So overall I would be willing to wait for the rollout of segwit to buy us sometime, and see if new technologies developed(weak block, IBLT etc) would allow a hard fork to become much more doable.

No, core devs do not get paid and contracted to develop and maintain the code, so you could just keep moving the goal post ad infinitum about what they should do to "take care of my money", but (1) people's energies(especially when they are free) are limited, they better spend them on places where they are irreplaceable; (2) trying to become rhetoricians may just lead to them losing the qualities of being good devs. So overall, I would choose the option of letting them proceed in the way they already are, and get someone else to do the job of communication.
And talking about social communication, you as a public figure in the community, writing a reddit post demanding already highly stressed and stretched core devs to add another burden to their workload, for free, without providing any constructive advice, while implying they are somehow socially incompetent, is certainly not being helpful in this regard.

A DOS attack costs dimes from Russian botnet ops bro. I haven't seen proof that it's done by core supporters.


No, Bitcoin consensus is not an election, a majority doesn't matter, consensus means(at least) almost everyone agrees, otherwise people using the old nodes will lose money, as theory and experience both show, so unless, say, the number of full nodes not supporting larger blocks drop to below 10, it's presumptuous to move forward.
And even if all your accusations were true, a hard-fork shouldn't be done like this because it will probably cause disasters, we are not trying to gauge support, we are trying to avoid a disaster that could kill Bitcoin.

It's funny that people arguing for "Network Effect" today don't seem to understand its implications. Miners, full node runners, and businesses are asked to bear the cost to get as many new users on board as possible, but what lays ahead?

No, consensus is what effectively everyone in the network agrees.

At first glance they use a weaker assumption than works related to SNARK,  which usually leads to worse performance. Moreover it's an interactive protocol so probably can't be used with digital currency at this stage.

Some people asked why we can't limit the tx size/sigops to deal with the problem Segwit mostly eliminates with the algorithmic improvement, here is an(hopefully correct) answer.
First you really want to cap the number of sigops/bytes hashed(i.e., the amount of computation) rather than the size, because otherwise large yet computationally cheap txs would just be rejected for no gain.
Now capping sigops/hashed bytes per block would create another form of attack: 
which the current version of Bitcoin Core also suffers from.
Essentially you can either create a bunch of computationally expensive transactions to deplete the quota of sigops/hashed bytes allowed per block, with much smaller cost than a general spamming attack, or the fee formula should be expanded to include another(very unintuitive and unpredictable for human) degree of freedom, for complex transactions this is probably gonna be one huge PITA.
EDIT: Transaction selection is already a NP-hard knapsack problem for the miners:  not sure how much more complexity will be added by throwing computational complexity itself into the mix, if miners decide to prioritize transactions based on not just two, but three factors.

Does Bitcoin Core relay blocks it hasn't finished validating? What if another block arrives during the validation? I am trying to see if miners have incentives to impose this limit in place, which they arguably do in the case of the block size, because large blocks are slower to propagate(at least that's what I think).


I don't get it, surely I would hope other miners to mine on the top of my block, so I should try to respect their limit, like in the case of the block size?

Nah, it was designed in such a way that a unsuccessful hard-fork could kill it, so a rational majority would be deterred from taking action.


Of course anyone can write a different client, but the block parameters are a different beast. It's like you can write your own TCP/IP stack, but every stack should speak the same protocol or internet stops functioning. No network stack programmer would be insane enough to not design according to the protocol spec and try to swing the majority to follow him.

It's just basic common sense for any networking software dev that you will have to design according to the standard protocol, you can innovate when it comes to how you implement it, but trying to change those parameters on you own is beyond stupidity.(yeah FYI alternative Bitcoin clients exist for years, some of them even are sympathetic with the big block cause, they are just not as insane as the Bitcoin Classic devs to believe they can push for a contentious hard fork)

ETH mining is specifically designed to be non-competitive, economy of scale at this point doesn't work. Also during a period of significant upward market activity, miners would be cautious to add more equipments, wary that the current price is unsustainble to justify the sunk cost.

That's correct, if we could turn back time, I believe this limit should be made a soft cap rather than a hard cap. However, that's really how most of the relevant rules came into place, created in "time immemorial" for reasons irrelevant today, and that's how everyone just goes by the rule because well, because they are certain none of the interested parties today was behind it.


Because the network, given its degree of decentralization, could not be upgraded wholesale with a hard fork, somebody is going to be inevitably left out, and as a result of this suffering monetary losses through no fault of their own, if we wilfully allow this to happen, we are probably no better than the central banks. I tend to believe the block size should increase in the future, but I am strongly opposed to take any action without almost universal consensus(e.g., until there are only a handful of unupgraded nodes so no SPV client could possibly retrieve block headers exclusively from them) In this regard I am in agreement with certain core devs, like Pieter Wuille.

@_date: 2016-03-10 21:52:05
A miner or a group of miners with &gt;50% hashpower can "turn back" the block ntime slowly, as the only requirement for the ntime is " greater than the median timestamp of previous 11 blocks"
What's the difference between this attack and 51%? The difference is (1). you can directly steal rather than just double-spend; (2). it can be carried out at no cost to anyone else or the miners themselves so it won't cause a havoc: every miner gets his block rewards, nobody is orphaned, yet the ntime is turned back, once it's 24 hours behind, everybody can happily build upon a should be invalid block, the only loser is the one getting attacked.
@_date: 2016-03-09 17:43:51
What also needs to be said is that in Bitcoin, the judicial power rests in the laws of cryptography itself and is omnipresent and unmistakable and impartial. Any full node can check if the executive council of miners have 100% correctly interpreted and executed the rules being given to them by the entire economy.
The difference between running a full node yourself and entrusting it to someone else, is like the difference between becoming a legislator yourself to supervise if the law has been properly enforced by committing some resources and electing someone else to represent you, and we already know how the later works out.

The million dollar paragraph for big block supporters: 
"Linear scaling of sighash operations
A major problem with simple approaches to increasing the Bitcoin blocksize is that for certain transactions, signature-hashing scales quadratically rather than linearly.
In essence, doubling the size of a transaction increases can double both the number of signature operations, and the amount of data that has to be hashed for each of those signatures to be verified. This has been seen in the wild, where an individual block required 25 seconds to validate, and maliciously designed transactions could take over 3 minutes.
Segwit resolves this by changing the calculation of the transaction hash for signatures so that each byte of a transaction only needs to be hashed at most twice. This provides the same functionality more efficiently, so that large transactions can still be generated without running into problems due to signature hashing, even if they are generated maliciously or much larger blocks (and therefore larger transactions) are supported."
@_date: 2016-01-23 10:40:38
You probably have no idea what you are talking about. "Decentralised" means nobody is in control and nobody is able to steer the network in any direction. To 'compete' as a cohesive unit is precisely the nature of a corporation with someone in charge.
Think of it this way, if the network is really ideally decentralised, there would be thousands of miners distributed around the world, not knowing each other and each contributes only a small share of the computing power, trying to convince them to act like a single unit, is like convincing all the Email servers in the world to upgrade, close to impossible, and undesirable, because anyone who is able to influence the network in a significant way would immediately become the target of our adversaries.

Even if people can be incentivized to do this, nothing has been developed to prove if an address receiving the payment is associated with a real full node, that is, a computer that has the functions of a full node and is functioning as a full node.
Now the most important function of a full node is to store a copy of the blockchain, there are indeed proposed solutions for efficiently proving if a computer really stores a up to date copy of the blockchain, but such technologies are complex, no one has taken up the job AFAIK, and diverting resources to their development would probably lead people to condemn it as wasting resources on projects with no prospect of success rather than focusing on simple, direct, short-term solutions.

Y2K is even less comparable to what we are facing than apples to oranges.
 1.You don't usually have any knowledge whether a particular computer is Y2K vulnerable, while on the Bitcoin network, all full nodes are fully reachable, an attacker could easily test one after another;
2.unlike Bitcoin, exploitation of the Y2K bug hardly leads to what Kaminsky termed as "a pot of gold at the end of rianbow" directly stealable, and that's why Bitcoin is one of the most security critical code in the world. In fact, you don't even know how should you exploit Y2K for profits.
3.Meanwhile, with much less gain, the risk of exploiting Y2K for profit was much bigger, you can count on the law enforcement agencies to go after the hackers who tried to exploit Y2K, while in our case, even if they do care, the exploiters would be hardly prosecutable as there is no criminalization of double-spending in any part of the world.
4.Internet hacking technique was also much less developed;
5.The existence of Y2K bug was transmitted to almost everyone with a computer through all sorts of media channels, because they could affect a much larger number of people.Plus, at pre-2000, most computer users were much less noobish than now and realized the importance to upgrade.
6.System providers just release updates for Y2K, while in Bitcoin's case, it's like asking users to download another distribution of Windows called 'Windows Classic'.

Things get even trickier when you move from Satoshi's "most miners are honest" model to the "most miners are rational, profit-driven and nothing else" model. 
Imagine I am a big mining farm, I could just change my version bits to make other miners believing that I will mine on Neocoin's chain, and I indeed start mining on it, and extend the Neocoin chain a number of blocks longer than the Bitcoin chain, then suddenly I switch back to mine on the Bitcoin chain.
If my gamble is successful, I could double spend lots of transactions on the Neocoin chain with the unwitting help of miners remaining on the Bitcoin chain, weaken my opponent miners who are fully invested in the Neocoin because they receive nothing in mining income due to the re-org, and possibly amplify my income by shorting Neocoin. At the same time, I get to dominate the Bitcoin mining for at least a short while, and get most of the block rewards.

I think I stated in my previous post that many Chinese miners do share the same misconception that miners vote on chains, while many others stress that the economic majority is the only thing the miners will follow, actually this is [what]( Bitmain's Jihan Wu had to tell me lately, yet they probably hadn't gone as far as realizing that the users also reserve the power to change the PoW function until Luke dropped the bomb(there's an interesting factor in play here: some miners apparently are worried that a Bitcoin with mining concentrated in China, cannot compete against one dominated by non-Chinese, possibly Western miners).

I am not responsible for what he said, but it must be noted that even if Bitmain doesn't control the majority of the hashrate, it likely exerts significant influence on them, as it controls a large part of the mining equipment supply, so they can determine, e.g., whoever kowtows to them gets the best price quote.

E.g., it took nearly 10 years for the Euro to be introduced, and in each member nation a referendum was held, which at least proved the currency had the support of a real majority at the time.

The fees/day generally noisy data, because there were big days of trading/major thefts when the senders just paid whatever it took to have their transactions processed quickly, and there was a historical network-wide fee reduction due to the policy introduced into the bitcoin core 0.8.2 which results in fees pre-May 2013 much higher. nevertheless when you smooth it out you get something like this:

If you go all out there to convince the miners to help you with the hard fork, you are arguably participating in something that risk losing someone else big money.

This so-called objection does not address any of my points at all.
For the miners, if the Bitcoin price stays stable, then as my original thesis stated, they are giving up fee incomes for getting more users on board. Otoh, if the Bitcoin price skyrockets, then the cost in fiat for doing a transaction will grow with the Bitcoin price, so users would not pay any less fees for a payment, otherwise in the end they still could not make up for the loss in the miners' income.
And for full node runners, even if we concede that the price stability is somehow related to the number of nodes in the network(which is laughably untrue, a centralized network could very well lead to a much stabler market price)it doesn't make any economic sense that the cost of maintaining a node keeps increasing with the blocksize while the price remains stable. Full node runners could be altruistic to an extent, but that's assuming the cost for maintaining a node mostly stays constant, the best altruists would give up going bankrupt.


Or how about this: me and a couple of my friends filling blocks with useless junk transactions? I hope you realize that competing crypto currencies have resources, and of course other forces hostile to Bitcoin do.

Segwit allows adding any new signing OP code with a softfork, it's one of the reasons you will want it.
QC, according to optimistic predictions from experts, would be practical(not sure how practical is practical though) around 2025.

In general a negotiation can only be successful when both sides come to the table in good faith, however I have noticed that some Chinese pool ops seem to have the interesting habit of talking in one way before the English-speaking developers, and another way in private within their small group.

That being said, yeah, I agree that the fee is already high enough, but people would probably forget about it if a bubble happened right here and now.

1. Core devs are not capable of  **changing** the consensus, the status quo consensus exists because it always has been, they are just mad because someone believe they can change it politically. If core devs could just upgrade the network to 2mb while disregarding any minority opposition, they would be the targets, and they would be those at fault.
2. About miners: did you notice that I was talking about an ideally decentralised network? We are a long way from that, but still, my bet is hard forkers would be defeated, we don't want anybody out there to lose money because they have no understanding of how Bitcoin works and follow the wrong chain, but if they want to try, nevermind, bring it on.

Heh, if "We're the exchanges, the miners, the wallets, the payment processors" along with some reddit shills could be counted as the economic majority, then Bitcoin is really small and has no real economy.
And what do you know about each of them, did you ask most of the exchange operators/payment processors from Australia to Zambia? The most convincing evidence for me, atm, is that the absolute super-dupermajority of full nodes are still on Bitcoin Core:  , you should at least wait until you can get most of them to your side to declare victory.

Here is some food for thought, if you want big blocks at some time in the future, you better pray gmaxwell will stay working on libsecp256k1, otherwise your full nodes would have a hell lota fun processing big blocks full of big transactions. In fact, libsecp256k1 is what makes processing near 1M transactions barely OK.
And no, you can't find an easy replacement for such people, pro-cryptographers likely wouldn't be interested as they consider K-256 a legacy curve, they would much rather peddle their own curves which they consider to be more efficient(actually they are) and theoretically elegant, it's a big business right now, even core devs would probably use an alternative curve/signature scheme if they choose to work on some altcoins. And we can't just switch to another signature scheme wholesale for obvious reasons.

The point is your "vast majority" is by no means a majority. I am yet to see more than 5% of the full nodes using any of the large block variety of Bitcoin client.
Your problem is exactly you believe with a majority of the hashrate you have some sort of a warrant to carry out the hard-fork. No, a majority of hashrate means nothing outside of the 51% attack scenario, in which case everyone's block structures are the same rather than different. And reddit puppet account count certainly means nothing as well.
@_date: 2016-01-20 20:07:15
1.Even if Core would be completely cooperative with the blocksize raise, it's impossible to avoid unupgraded nodes in a hard-fork(theory and experience both demonstrated, and frankly it's a no-brainer), which will inevitably lead to people losing money.
2.There is no overwhelming support, far from it, &gt;90% full nodes are running Core, numerous people/businesses using Bitcoin in the world never asked about their opinions, 72% of miners(well it's actually less than 60% now)+a reddit mob+a few Euro-American companies !=overwhelming majority, it's an extremely distorted picture of the Bitcoin community.
@_date: 2016-01-21 20:52:59
Except what you said doesn't apply in this case, they are specifically aiming for a hard fork, any cooperation from the core devs would almost inevitably lead to core devs becoming scapegoats for people's losses in a non-consensual hard fork. 
I fully support alternative Bitcoin implementations being developed, how ironic that the reddit mob choose a bunch of clowns with no track record whatsoever, while there are clients like btcd which has existed for years and developed by competent people, who are even somehow sympathetic to the big block cause.
@_date: 2016-01-27 19:35:58
Good to see dude that understands his stuff: 
"Segregated Witness is worth the effort even if it provided no block size increase,” Voisine said. “It has lots of advantages. The thing I think is most interesting about SegWit soft-fork technique is the ability to add new signature types such as Schnorr signatures. This means that if elliptic curve algorithms were broken, for instance by quantum computers in the future, we could fix that with only a soft fork, by adding a new quantum resistant digital signature algorithm. The fact that we get a quick, effective bump in block space is just a bonus.”
You know why Gavin likes Segwit? Here are the 3 aspects of Bitcoin he wanted to change most(emphasis are mine):
**1.Have transactions refer to previous outputs by a hash that omits the scriptSig.**
**2.Use Schnorr signatures instead of ECDSA**
   3.Go back in time and have the Bitcoin-Qt wallet use hierarchical deterministic keys.
From: 
Another crucial cryptographical improvement brought to you by Segwit: 
"Multisig payments currently use P2SH which is secured by the 160-bit HASH160 algorithm (RIPEMD of SHA256). However, if one of the signers wishes to steal all the funds, they can find a collision between a valid address as part of a multisig script and a script that simply pays them all the funds with only 80-bits (2^80) worth of work, which is already within the realm of possibility for an extremely well-resourced attacker. (For comparison, at a sustained 1 exahash/second, the Bitcoin mining network does 80-bits worth of work every two weeks)
Segwit resolves this by using HASH160 only for payments direct to a single public key (where this sort of attack is useless), while using 256-bit SHA256 hashes for payments to a script hash."
From: 
If anything deserves a fork of Bitcoin at whatever cost, I think it would be cryptographic hardening against looming attacks.

As many people here have pointed out: there are reasonably good alternative clients for years, some of them are even sympathetic to the big block cause,  However they do not try to force a contentious hard fork because they have technical common sense and professional integrity.
So in a race to the bottom the Reddit mob choose a bunch of charlatans/demagogues who  are perhaps most politically bold and technically inept to carry out their 'plan', these same people with no track record would end up maintaining the most security-critical code that takes care of your money, enjoy that.

Now, look, I know many people don't like LN, they think the hubs are going to gateway the access to the blockchain, I don't know if they are right with that. But you know what? Zero-conf sucks even more than LN, 0-conf is essentially "I trust some random dude hiding in the mountains of China to include my tx into the blockchain, and even if they screw me up my regulatory agencies will never be able to reach him".  And guess what, if somebody really wants to attack you, RBF can be done regardless if it's supported in the Core or not, and because your transaction is not confirmed, you can't even find out if the miner really did it. Now with such weak security, 0-conf is widely used by real Bitcoiners, so I would say, since LN's security is at least better than 0-conf, it will find its market among us, no doubt about it.

Faster Payments Service(FPS)  fares much better, they process about 80-90M txs per month atm：  
nothing can't be handled by the Bitcoin network though(30 txs/sec). Also FPS can only process payments of value below 100k pounds, that's why people still use CHAPS for large value settlements, and pay a large fee. This is actually intrinsic to a payment system relying on debt-relations. (obviously, the inner workings of all these payment systems are completely obscure so we have no way of knowing if there are other factors at work)

Some nodes running one client, some running another, now you are a merchant, the one which supports 2MB blocksize cap includes one tx in the extra space of its newest block for you, while the other which is capped to 1 MB doesn't, what are you gonna do? Accept it as a confirmation or not? If you do, you are essentially betting on this chain winning out in the end, or that tx would be invalid, and no merchant has the slightest interest in betting when it comes to the payment system they use, and no buyer would be interested to bet if the coins they are going to buy will eventually be the "right ones" as well(The block rewards on each chain go to different miners because 1MB nodes would just reject the newly mined 2MB blocks, effectively doubling the reward, breaking Bitcoin's controlled supply while we are in this limbo). It's very reasonable that if this difference is not resolved in a short time, Bitcoin's value will go to basically zero.
A unresolved hardfork is basically the end of everything, a softfork is much more desirable.
Another explanation with a graph can be read here:

Bitcoin is a global currency with many many people using it, many of them don't care whatever is going on the technical side, what debate there is with the blocksize.(Heck, do you keep yourself up to speed with Fed policies because you use USD?) Many of them don't even speak English.This subreddit by no means represent all the Bitcoin users, far from it. If a hard fork happens, it's predictable many nodes would not be upgraded in time.
Additionally, the hundreds of exchanges world wide, from Australia to Zambia, should not have any obligation to disrupt their infrastructures to support two chains concurrently, nor is there any guarantee that they would be capable of just that.
It's ironic that many on this subreddit are unable to comprehend how large the Bitcoin economy really is(these same people meanwhile, are predicting a drastic rise in the number of on-chain transactions), yes, Bitcoin is real, it happened, neither are its users limited to the neckbeard geeks, nor are the exchanges limited to a few reputable names like BItstamp or Bitfinex. The ridiculous delusion that as long as 75% of the mining power support a client a hard fork can  go ahead not only shows its believers' lack of technical understanding, but also their ignorance of the demographics of Bitcoin users, and possibly, a disgusting indifference to the possible material damages other people may suffer as a result of their greeds.

Step 1: Release the client with the Segwit update;
Step 2. Everybody installs it, other than the miners, gradually the number of Segwit nodes reach the majority of the network;
Step 3.upgrade again, so blocks don't conform to the Segwit rules are rejected by Segwit nodes past a deadline;
Step 4. now any block from non-Segwit supporting miners would be orphaned;
Step 5. PROFIT!!
But that's not the point, the real point is nobody imposes a consensus protocol change without consensus, deadlock is the modus operandi of Bitcoin, and while I think big blockers' ideas are stupid, I do consider their opposition important.

There is something missing in your EMH theory IMO, in that a significant part of capital maybe in the mining exactly to acquire bitcoins, that's why they were not reflected in the price, but the hashrate.
Now assume this influx of capital is constant, sometime before the halving we could reach a point where it's no longer possible for some of the capital to acquire bitcoins in the cheap due to the reduction in block reward, leaving them with no recourse but to hit the market.

Therefore anyone who is able to even see those transactions with less than 0.00001 bitcoins/1000 satoshis fees or roughly less than 4 satoshis paid per byte in his mempool, are either using an old version of the client, or has made a deliberate effort to welcome spams into his mempool.

With an address balance system, if you accidentally sign a transaction to another address twice, there is no way the miner could know that you made a mistake, as long as there is enough remaining balance.
If you accidentally spend the same "outputs" twice, the two transactions would clearly be in conflict with each other, and only one of them would go into the blockchain.
Far more importantly, is that in an address balance system, whenever one wants to spend from his address, the miner has to make sure the spender really has the amount of bitcoins he claims to have, so the miner has to be able to trace it back to another sender, and all the way back to the coinbase transaction where the coins are mined, however, all satoshis that this spender received in one transaction have to be unique, because otherwise the spender could just replicate a legit signed transaction to him and submit it to the miner and the miner would not be able to tell if it's from the original sender. Now how do you distinguish all these satoshis in different transactions? That's how they eventually become partitioned into units called outputs.
The same characteristic of the system is also used to design the Lightning Network, but far more elaborated.
This is only one of the possible reasons, there could be many others.

The thing is you can almost already kinda do what Todd proposed with the existing functionalities. most of what need to be written are on the client side. E.g., you can prove an output has been spent via a SPV proof, which has other uses(sidechains), even if you do not merge an OP code for the SPV proof directly, you can implement it manually after OP_CAT is reenabled after MAST is merged.

Capital control is not just about control of capital flow at the border, it's an all around restriction on where the capital can go to. E.g., many capital-heavy industries in China are mostly completely state-monopolized(the petroleum industry, telecommunication, cable networks, power grid...), ever wonder why the housing bubble in China is particularly crazy? There is just too much capital with not enough investment opportunities, and the money wants to find a way out, and they naturally flow to Bitcoin, espeically when the economy takes a downturn.

In every single informal vote which only count genuine Bitcoiners(with node count, hashrate, or bitcoins) rather than those easily manipulable by shill accounts, I have seen Core beating Classic by a large margin, and zero proof that voters want a 2MB HF.
The votings I talked about are:
1. The full node count of the Entire Bitcoin Network;
2. the hashrate voting done by Slush Pool;
3. the block signaling voting via stratrum server selection done by F2Pool;
4. the Bitcoinocracy coin voting.
I am one of those people who is willing to go by consensus, meaning that if I really see 'overwhelming consensus' demanding a 2MB HF, I would accept it as well. But again, I have as yet seen zero proof supporting it.

@_date: 2016-06-13 18:56:30
At this point, 6750 satoshis(or 5 cents) should get you a confirmation for an average one-to-one tx relatively quickly : 
However, the default fee in fiat currencies could be raising thanks to the rapidly increasing price,  last time it happened, the default fee was set 5 times lower as the expectation was miners should be content with receiving a stable fee income in fiats, and there was no reason to ask for more given they more than made up for it with the price rally. Not commenting on whether it's right for the devs to centrally coordinate the default fee, but merely we are facing the same situation again.
It's worth noting that whether the default fee or blocksize is changed or not, the user experience is likely to still be severely encumbered as many nodes have anti-spamming minimal relax tx fees in place that, with a multiplication of the price, could prove too expensive for many txs to even get relayed.
@_date: 2016-06-29 17:34:19
1.If a cryptocurrency is really being used,  instead of just traded, there would be a way to spend your money, such conditions however, may not apply to ether.
2.You can split your ethers into like 10 thousand addresses, it's hard to imagine every exchange will install a blacklist including all your addresses and update it as often as you channel your ethers into new addresses, which would be made even more difficult if the attacker sends part of them into random account addresses belonging to others, that have existing balances, just to muddy the waters.
3.As ethereum uses a account/balance model, there is a chance that the attacker can participate in some form of new DAOs/contracts/Ponzi schemes, and withdraw his ethers later without being identified. Whenever some exchanges fail to block his ether txs he could further wash them through these exchanges. The take-away from this whole thing is that for an attacker, any small fraction of the ethers he makes out with is a net win for him, as he acquired them nearly freely, and thus anonymity is a lot easier consider he can take more counterparty risks.

He was specifically referring to antpool when he talked about the relay delay. Otherwise validationless mining justifies as harmful and reckless behaviours from the pools, but 'attack' implies an intent to do damage which I have seen no proof, at least for the other 2 pools.
In fact, consider that a block header is just 80 bytes more than the block hash, I am as yet puzzled why didn't they do SPV mining instead, it could have simply been a case of sloppiness.

People paid even a fraction of the required fee would have their txs confirmed in 2 blocks:  according to the stats here, 5000 satoshis/0.00005 bitcoins/3 cents in fees are enough to get your tx confirmed in 2 blocks, no one paid even a barely reasonable fee should have a problem.

As a ethereum guy do you even remember how the Homestead HF was done?
The foundation decided on a block when the HF would be activated and past which the upgraded nodes would reject all non-Homestead blocks, which indicates a much greater degree of confidence, and dare we say, arrogance than even Gavin Andresen's BIP109, as it completely disregards the possibility that the majority of miners would not upgrade past the deadline.(in Bitcoin if you do a HF like that it would be considered suicidal) I can only assume such confidence either come from a degree of control much greater than it seems or just ignorance(unlikely)
The ethereum foundation people de facto builds the community, almost ever link passes through them, they are the nexus of the community, they could toe the 'decentralization' party line, paying the lip service all day long but they themselves are actually indispensable to Ethereum.
And no, a HF is very different from a SF.

Bitcoin Core's users, if they can be called 'customers', are the tens of thousands of people out there running the full node software that they develop.
Therefore it's of primary importance to the Core developers to do everything to make sure running Bitcoin Core doesn't cost their users too much in initial blockchain download time/bandwidth/disk space, which would eventually lead to people give up running nodes, and all their efforts pointless, since who wants to produce software that no one uses?
The opinion of Silicon valley companies are no more important than any common node operator, and the opinion of non-Core users should be completely irrelevant to them.

Of course it's not a user error anyway you look at it, if by a "user" you meant a full node runner which suffers from so-called "mempool jam"-the jam is only visible to those who deliberate set the relay fee so low that they are literally like welcoming the spam txs to their mempool, nvm running a full node itself requires you to have some level of competence in the first place.
If you are talking about those sending txs, paying a fee is exactly how, and the only way we identify the sender as a user who needs a user experience, someone holding bitcoins individually is a "Bitcoin user", things like sockpuppeting on Reddit doesn't make you one.

ELI15: A 'finite state machine' aka a 'state machine' is the subset of a Turing machine aka a general computer, the states are basically all stored information of said machine which can be later manipulated by the computation functions, therefore all general purpose computers and programs, including Ethereum contracts need memories(think of RAM) and  persistent, long-term storages(think of the hard drive) to store these states.
However, creating storage pool on the blockchain directly like Ethereum does can be (1) insecure-almost all exploits make use of out of bounds access of the stoarge, or, like in the case of the DAO, improper changing/cleaning up of the states; (2) abusing the block space for storing other types of data(eternity wall etc.) So is there an alternative? Actually much of the relevant state information within the Bitcoin blockchain are already stored by the outputs, which have only two states 'spent' and 'unspent'(or 0 and 1), and these states can be changed from 'unspent' to 'spent' once, atomically, by a Bitcoin transaction. However Bitcoin transactions can only accept those inputs that their initiators are authorized to access, the script codes, at the moment, cannot read the state of just any output in the blockchain, one way to supply them with the state information of any output is to provide a cryptographic proof, the simplest one of which is something like a SPV proof used by the SPV clients, you prove that the transaction spending a particular output can be linked to a blockhash with a huge number of prefixing zeros via a Merkle tree, so a large amount of mining power must be involved in creating it, very likely it's in the main chain! But there are several lingering problems, like how do you reduce the proof size while ensure the security, and how do you prove the state of an output is 'unspent' rather than 'spent'(as in the case of SPV proof)? OP went on to explore a number of options.
I wrote in haste, any correction and criticism very welcomed.

Thanks for the thoughtful piece jratcliff, I am happy that we could find some common grounds.

Depends on your definition of 'better'.
Ethereum's PoW(Ethash) achieves its goals to a reasonable degree, i.e., delaying the advance of ASIC Ethash miners until they switch to PoS, however whether the goals themselves are worth pursuing is a matter of debate.
One of the frequently stated risk of ASIC mining is that their manufacturing can be controlled by a few manufacturers, however in the case of GPUs, they are actually much harder to produce than ASICs, and all the efficient Ethash GPUs are manufactured by AMD alone, if AMD cares enough they could pull a 51% attack on the network, or put a backdoor in the chips, at least I would argue "trusting AMD" is not a justifiable threat model for a currency like Bitcoin. 
Other than the manufacturer, governments and research institutions have large GPU clusters which they could switch to mine ETH, or any ASIC-resistant cryptocurrency and profit from it to justify the funding of their projects, this arguably puts them in a unfair advantage over the rest of GPU miners because there is little to none capital cost for them. While the cost of acquiring ASICs is mostly sunken for Bitcoin miners, indicating some degrees of commitment.
Additionally, GPU-only mining is supposed to resist mining centralization, this is probably wishful thinking, as GPUs are much harder to scale, which could lead to large players having even more advantages over smaller ones.
Additionally, Ethash verification is a lot more resource intensive than simple SHA256, which has given the implementation of Ethereum light clients a decent challenge.

Some technical and historical perspective: it's well known in the cypherpunk circle or anyone working in related fields that the first cryptographic electronic money was ecash(also known as Chaumian Cash) invented by David Chaum, and later years of work improving on ecash produced many of Bitcoin's predecessors and finally led to Bitcoin. Part of Satoshi's motives in choosing such a title may have to do with claiming such a lineage, as academic writings often do.
Within the scope of such works, a coin is defined as, according to Satoshi "a chain of digital signatures", which you can trace back to the mint(like cash but not entirely identical) and thus unique, in sharp contrast to the credit system used in most of the payment and banking systems around the world, which uses an account and balance system. Funds within the same account become completely indistinguishable, and any transaction sent from an account will have to include a counter  value to uniquely identify this transaction, or it could be stored and resent again to remove funds from this account again and again until it's empty.(The need for a counter value to be associated with an account is part of the reason why pruning is so hard for Ethereum)
Otoh, Satoshi indeed emphasize in the abstract of the whitepaper that his cash allows payment to be sent from one party to another without a third party, so it's no doubt enabling P2P payment is part of his motives as well.

A "P2P electronic cash system", is not equal to a "P2P electronic cash system you should use for all your payments". To have such a system is wonderful, but expecting it to be competitive against other electronic payment systems, is another matter.(VISA does 5,000 tps, Wechat and Alipay does...50,000, and even if you can somehow manage to get the full nodes process so many txs, by the time you can do it, centralized processors are gonna leap forward by a few orders of magnitude)
In fact, albeit Bitcoin evangelists like to use on-chain payments to buy everything they need, for most of the purchases an on-chain payment is completely unnecessary, or at least, has no benefit over using something like a payment channel/LN.  The reason a transaction goes online, in my opinion, is to make it "unstoppable", that it will go through when almost the entire world comes down on you like a wall of bricks, it's a very strong security guarantee, do you need such a guarantee for every tx you make every day? Hardly. In fact I would argue most of your daily purchases can be replaced with something like LN, because let's face it, if you are under such strong legal pressure that all LN hubs will refuse your txs, most merchants, most of them operating legally, would not accept them anyway. 
Now after stripping away the consumeristic payments, it becomes a lot clearer that Bitcoin can be used as a payment+settlement system/much in the same way as cash, with a reasonable scale, consider that the payment tx you use it for reduces from a dozen in one day to one in a dozen days(settle debts with your friend, buying things that the government doesn't want you to buy, international payments), if used in combination with LN.

It's rather funny how much the DAO's exploit has to do with Ethereum's approach of replacing outputs with accounts/balances, the 'replay attack' has been haunting them since the beginning(the Ethereum blockchain is so far unprunable because of this) and is finally costing them dearly.
UTXOs by themsleves guarantee transaction atomicity, so repeated draining is impossible as long the inflation cap is preserved, as you can't just go and make a tx to simply spend a certain number of bitcoins, you have to specify the particular, unique outputs, via their txhashes, that you want to spend, and you can only spend each output once, if you make multiple transactions from the same outputs, only one of which will be confirmed.
Otoh only Bitcoin Core supports 'Coin Control' afaik, so frequently people who are unhappy with a unconfirmed tx cannot double spend them.

If anyone could remember, F2Pool mined 50k blocks for a while and only raised their size under the community pressure.

Well, hedging here basically means the miner opens a short position to mitigate the risk of Bitcoin price crash. Say you project that your cost of producing one bitcoin is $300 and the market price atm is $500, then opening a short position could guarantee that even if the price goes down a lot, with you mining at a loss, your short position would profit and your total margin per coins is still at $500-300=$200 per coin, assuming your share of the hashrate remains stable. Unless, of coz, the price gets so high that your short position gets called, so the miners would either need to close their positions in anticipation of a rally(I acutally witnessed the moderator of a miners group reminding members to close their positions sometime during the first spike), or convince the exchanges that their farms could produce enough coins to cover their positions eventually, so they don't get liquidated in case the price soars.  This sort of practice is actually so prevalent that in China there are specialized mining financial management firms handling it for miners.
Re: OKC, it's likely that most of the hedges are executed using futures on OKC, probably the primary reason why it becomes the dominant price leading market globally. The most important futures on OKCoin are quarterlies which gets settled every 3 months, with price frequently fluctuating during the run up to the settlement date, the next settlement date is 09/30 and mentioned in the post I replied to.

Did you see how the Ethereum Homestead HF was done? They simply decided a block number on which the HF is going to be activated then hard coded it into the clients, before the Homestead release was even used by the majority of the network. This indicates a much greater degree of confidence than even Gavin's BIP109(the new diff adjustment algorithm would require a Homestead node to ignore any non-Homestead block even if the majority of the network has not upgraded), I wonder where does that confidence come from, and would add a serious pinch of salt to any of Vitalik's claims about 'decentralization'. In fact I saw on etherchain.org a majority of miners going from a non-Homestead Geth version to a Homestead Geth version immediately, then back to the old version, then to the new version, and finally to a even newer bug-fixing release all in a matter of days, could be site dysfunctioning though.
Compare that with e.g., BIP9 for a SF, 95% of the last 2016 blocks in the 'STARTED' state would transition you to the 'LOCKED-IN' state, under which miners are given two weeks time to finish the transition before the SF is finally active.

One interesting thing I noted that was most of the Core devs weren't aware that the blocksize increase campaign was backed by some big players in the industry, who appeared to stay behind the stage and never communicated to the Core devs about their demands, until sometime around when Classic was in full force.
While I understand and deem it healthy that many people oppose Core out of their genuine demands for a capacity increase, I believe that these certain 'Bitcoin companies' want to wrestle the control of Bitcoin development to fit their agenda, which was made all the more obvious by the pivoting of one such company to Ethereum(and they made it clear that they like PoS more than PoW etc).

As you can see [here]( A large number of those transactions, are not even going to ever get relayed by nodes with the default minimum relay fee set to 1000 satoshis in 0.12, transactions with lower than 500 satoshis fees alone account for between 15-20M or half of the mempool size in the above graph. For the rest of the transactions, many of them are hardly ever gonna get mined because of miners' own minimum fee threshold for including a tx in the block, and is it any wonder that despite the growth in total transaction size, the fee/byte actually [goes down drastically](

It's really interesting that Rick is so vocal against Segwit, perhaps the only real solution to his own particular [problem](
As you can see by following the link, one of the major reasons that he was charged such a high fee was that the tx came with a huge witness, which Segwit could have significantly discounted when it comes to the fees, now let's withholding our judgement to say if such discounting is right or wrong.
But another immediate change only enabled by Segwit is Schnorr signature, which will decimate the witness size for his multi-input tx to be roughly the same as one normal 1-to-1 tx, and greatly reduce the fee he would have to pay.
So definitely curious that Rick is asking what problem Segwit is trying to solve, when it's almost like tailored for him!

They are related issues, if the hashrate is sufficiently decentralized it would be impractical to do a fork, hard or soft.


Oh, don't assume malice here, if anything these pools are just in some sort of a natural conspiracy to reduce their orphan rate, they are genuinely different entities(not to say 2 of the 3 don't have any hashrate of their own) rather than sockpuppets.
And as far as I can see, your title is incorrect, it's not a block withholding attack, rather, phantomcircuit stated that the pools are listening on each other's stratum servers which would pop forth the block hash before even the header+block content are received, in order to reduce the delay in switching.

It would be a lot more helpful then, if you can sometimes clarify some of your statements a bit when there is possibility of negativity.
E.g., your famous claim after the selfish-mining paper: "Bitcoin is broken." My understanding is that you used 'broken' in the cryptographic sense, namely any system that has been found to be weaker than its designed strength is broken(under the same definition, AES is broken as well). But most non-academicians wouldn't interpret it that way and have no reason to, to them 'broken' means something cannot function anymore and is most likely useless.

If Mike Hearn really intended to sabotage Bitcoin, he has done one heck of a job by starting this controversy. The continued polarization resulting from it could probably lead to disastrous consequences. Atm we are in a game theoretically rather precarious position: miners/pools could eventually decide to hard fork on their own out of a lack of information, which creates the false belief that the HF will not be contentious and progress smoothly. Early adopters/hodlers will interpret the HF as a betrayal of Bitcoin and decide to dump their holdings, with other investors/adversaries/rivalries(governments, banks, altcoiners etc) jump in on the opportunity to take profits/disrupt the network, as a result the price would crash to the ground and lead to a much smaller market size, and possibly eventual destruction of Bitcoin now that the network is much more vulnerable.

Outrage what? At the GFW? Yeah sure is there anyone with a sane mind not hating GFW or state-sponsored censorship in general? At the miners? They are playing a fair game as far as this topic is concerned and there is nothing to be outrageous about.
The PoW we are using is basically a embodiment of capitalism, and has the same characteristics, namely that it's bad but everything else is worse.
And it's not really that relevant to the issue at hand, hashers don't care about blocksize/GFW, they only transmit 100 bytes of data which can get through any network rather easily, the problems are with the pools, no matter what PoW you use, you need pools if you want a steady revenue stream, the only fundamental solution to such problem lies with something like P2Pool.
@_date: 2016-06-14 10:22:49


It's discounted, rather than not counted, in the sense that one byte of witness is charged less than one byte of utxo under Segwit, the rationale behind this is that the UTXO set is a pretty precious resource, as it cannot be pruned and thus should be stored by all full nodes, and thus should be made more expensive to thwart 'spamming' behaviours like encoding the outputs in a way to store non-financial information.
This debate about whether the blockchain should store non-financial information has been going on for years, and Segwit's fee calculation has been relatively contentious, a Google search should return you lots of [results](

Lol, dude, they stated on more than one occasion that they kept most of their mined coins,  they are so comfortable with their margin so fat that they can just nap through the entire halving. Bitfury is sitting on piles of coins that they only make a half-hearted effort to expand their own farms and instead focus on how to facilitate decentralization by moving hashpower to small-time miners.

At this point, anyone smart enough would have known it's near impossible to try to deal a blow to the dark net by trying to prevent people from buying bitcoins.
We already have the first decentralized exchange software, Bitsquare, and a variety of other offline channels for trading. While using Bitsquare poses some challenges and is certainly not for everyone, we all know the kind of mark-up and counterparty risk drug addicts are willing to accept to get their hands on the drugs, so at worst, all French Bitcoin businesses are outlawed, and all forms of Bitcoin tradings are quickly pushed to the underground.

More importantly, there are hundreds of hashers behind those several pools, they were very wary that if they fucked up the hashers wouldn't go easy on them. Both F2Pool and Antpool have emphasized this at past.

What you don't realize is what you refer to as 'pure speculation' is one and the same with 'capital control circumvention' here.
Capital control is not just about control of capital flow at the border, it's an all around restriction on where the capital can go to. E.g., many capital-heavy industries in China are mostly completely state-monopolized(the petroleum industry, telecommunication, cable networks, power grid...), ever wonder why the housing bubble in China is particularly crazy? There is just too much capital with not enough investment opportunities, and the money wants to find a way out, and they naturally flow to Bitcoin, espeically when the economy takes a downturn.

Right, it's true that many of us are quite a bit obsessed with lucky numbers, but the urban myth imagination that we apply the rules everywhere is just ridiculous, how can a modern society possibly function if some numbers are avoided everywhere? (More often than not, a lucky number has some social values, if a number is sought after, it probably needs some resources to acquire, so if your business partner has a phone number ending with "88888", that's an indirect way of demonstrating his financial strength)
Actually it probably costed Mike Hearn everything when he contemptuously stated that the Chinese miners  accepted a 8M blocksize because "8" is a lucky number to them, rather than the 20M blocksize as he would have liked is purely suicidal.

Never in Bitcoin history had Core developers publicly encouraged naive investors to put their money in a scheme with significant security flaws that are well known.(they were audited with the bug leading to today's event pointed out to them) The endorsement of these developers/foundation members was arguably the most important reason the DAO was able to absorb so much money.

IIRC Matt hardly ever mentioned his contribution to bitcoinj publicly, unlike Hearn, not saying either approach was right or wrong though.


He called Adam Back and Greg Maxwell liars and puppet masters, that's quite a bit different from mere disagreement. His trash talk towards the Chinese miners also probably costed him his XT.


Not saying that, but it also doesn't mean people should not ridicule him for his doom-and-gloom, if his contribution should be recognized separately, so should his failure.


Hearn said that he got the approval of his superiors to spend his 20% time at Google to work on it. He actually fared quite a bit better than many other devs who were constantly without a proper job.

FWIW, Bitfinex uses a segregated multisig wallet provided by BitGo for each user, instead of pooling all the coin into the exchange's wallet.

HODLers are more important for another reason IMO, especially the early/relatively early adopters.
They are the last line of defense against manipulation/government crackdown, if there are a large number of hodlers the governments/established financial interests can never confiscate/acquire via manipulation most of the bitcoins, and when the price crashes, early adopters usually used their profits(because we have went through so many bubbles) to buy moar.

Tor is vital to Bitsquare not just as an anonymization tool, but it is really what makes Bitsquare a P2P exchange. Each Bitsquare node is ran as a Tor hidden service and fully independent of any single centralized third party service(which can be shut down and paralyze the network) to establish connection with another Bitsquare node, I don't know of any other large scale P2P network like this exist(Bitmessage is super small and has a high delay), other than the very limited in functionality Bitcoin network.

The arbitrator uses TLSNotary to verify if a bank transfer has been made in a fiat-bitcoin trade. The risks involved in this model including:
1.The trading volume could be sufficiently big that there is a chance the arbitrator can be corrupted, especially at the nascent stage, when there isn't a well-developed arbitrator network.
2.There is a small chance that your bank is incompatible with TLSNotary due to the online banking website's use of AJAX technology and other stuff, I suspect a list of tested banks may exist somewhere. It would be well advised for the buyer to test his bank statement page with Pagesigner/TLSNotary himself.
3.Arguably the most significant one, in many nations, you could revoke your bank transaction or freeze the sellers' account after the fiat has been sent, by just claiming, e.g., someone hacked into your account and it wasn't you who made the transfer, there isn't much TLSNotary can help the seller in which case, especially when the banks are hostile to Bitcoin, and that's why bitbargain.co.uk has developed a quick ID check procedure of taking a photo of your name on the bank card, and the name on the card must match that on the bank transfer.
4.Price fluctuation risk, on Bitsquare, the maximum wait time before arbitration can be requested is 24 hours, and the seller could wait this long before confirming the receipt of your bank transfer, during which time the Bitcoin price could move significantly.

It isn't, at this point and likely any point in the future, a government takeover of the mining industry is much less likely to happen in China than in the West. Western Bitcoin mining businesses almost invariably willingly cooperate with government regulations and would not resist if they are legally required to shut down(the regulation, not the electricity cost as commonly believed, is the reason most of the hashrate is in China), while in China, you pretty much can get a warehouse and find a electricity supplier(not necessarily legally) and off you go, same as a large part of Chinese economy has always been operating.
In fact, I would argue a Chinese government crackdown could help with decentralization as the oligarchy that controls pooling will be liquidated while the miners will not.

It's important to understand that Bitcoin Core devs are first and foremost developers of a full node client, catering to the need of full node users therefore should remain their first priority. Asking them to 'scale' by voluntarily making their own software obsolete because some Bitcoin companies have problems with their businesses, or because some archaeological works reveal that the creator may not want people to use their software eventually, makes no sense(just like asking full node users to give up on their right to use a full node for the good of Bitcoin) under all circumstances, and puts undue power on those devs.
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:16:35
Also FYI, a good rule of thumb to remember is that Bitcoin Core connects to 8 nodes randomly selected across the whole IP address range, so in the case the node count is fabricated, it's very unlikely your Core node neighbours will compose mostly of the client that make up the pumped node count.

The censorship carried out by the GFW, as almost any form of censorship, is relative.
It's not really possible to completely stop people from going to whatever website they like, GFW just make it way too painful to do so, that many will give up. E.g., one of the stupidest ways to retrieve the contents of a website is to simply ask someone outside the wall to E-mail you all the contents, it's doable, but terribly inefficient.
It's much less of a problem for Bitcoin  because Bitcoin requires way less bandwidth to keep in sync than, e.g., normal web browsing. A full block is only 1M, even if you increase the cap to 10M, it's like 16KB/min(correction: 16KB/sec) to be less than two blocks behind the global network for a full node, not to say SPV,  which requires far less, So Bitcoin is very usable under low bandwidth, that alone makes it much more difficult to block than, say, Youtube traffic.
In addition, partially because of the low bandwidth reuqirement, running a full node connectable by full nodes from China outside the wall is arguably easier than running a Tor node, and also possibly less detectable by GFW for other reasons.

Fee scheduling. "Hot" outputs(those that have just been spent a very short time ago) should be doubly punished with fees, it's in the Core since a long time ago, but we have no idea how miners really implement it. As the recent fork told us, they could do any number of dumb things.

But when you have 10,000 miners mining with their GPUs, and no one knows, and can only make the most malicious assumption about another, they would be really hesitant to make any protocol-level change because one miner has no idea whether that will cause their block being rejected, the network will therefore, adopt any blocksize cap change in a bit-by-bit, gradual manner, like a miner will increase the cap just enough so that the additional fee income will compensate for the orphan rate loss.
The fact that you know there is a group out there can be persuaded to make coordinated changes=slow degradation into politics.

They can associate several addresses with one single identity, which is essentially how chain analysis works, e.g., if one address took part in some public activities like gathering donations or receiving coins from an exchange that does KYC, and is later reused in some other txns, then frequently you can infer that one single person is behind all these activities. And that's why people recommend "not reusing addresses" as the most basic/effective measure of privacy protection.
A full node taking queries from you can map all the address queries from one single IP to one entity, so it doesn't need to even pay attention to privacy protection methods like non-reusal, and frequently works even when Tor is used by doing some more elaborated analysis, and don't forget, when only big corps/organizations run full nodes, they could just disable Tor usage all together.

It must be emphasized that the so called "Core roadmap"  in question is actually Gregory Maxwell's personal proposal, which basically anyone identifiable could have chosen to sign on his own free will.
There maybe significant legal and other implications of setting up Core as some sort of an organization with the power to make the network do an upgrade.

I hope people realize the danger and idiocy of painting Core as some sort of a vested interest group who can single-sidedly impose a change on the network, putting them "in charge" is a bane rather than a boon.  In fact they are reluctant to even present a facet of unity for good communication's sake. Core should remain what it is, a diverse group of all sorts of developers from all around the world voluntarily cooperating in the development of Bitcoin, with nobody being entrusted to decide things for others, as any concentration of power is guaranteed to attract the interest of governments.

ELI5: Right now a multi-input tx in Bitcoin would require a signature for each address involved in the tx to be accepted, this essentially makes a N-party tx N times as large as a 1 to 1 tx.

A real incentive for everyone to use CoinJoin, even if you have "nothing to hide", could be a significant boon to fungibility.

I hope Turing completeness would not become the new "big block", especially due to the competing pressure from ETH.

China has a surplus of electricity generation capacity, largely in the form of private-owned small power plants(mostly hydroelectric), the state-owned national grid is reluctant to purchase electricity from private small power plants, many of them have no choice but to sell(happily) their power to bitcoin mining farms, some of the farms even have profit-sharing agreement with these small power plants. 
So in order to compete, you need to go to countries with electricity surplus as well, I overheard in some Chinese Wechat group that electricity in Venezuela is ridiculously cheap, but many are reluctant to relocate there because of the political risks.
Personally, I suspect, Bitcoin maybe that push needed for renewable energy to get big, imagine if you country have nothing but a big desert, you might just build a solar power farm, and power a Bitcoin farm with that.

According to Nakamoto, the blockchain is a timestamping system. The time order of transactions are determined by the blocks they are mined in.  We don't trust and don't need any other source of time within Bitcoin, otherwise there would not be a need for Bitcoin and mining. E.g., if the entity processing the transactions tells you that Alice pays for her coffee with her 1 bitcoin output, so she cannot pay for her bus ticket with this already spent output, he is in fact telling you that the coffee transaction comes **before** the bus ticket transaction, if the transaction processor lies about the time ordering after the coffee tx and tells the network that the bus ticket tx comes first, then the coffee tx becomes invalid because an output can be spent only once and the coffee vendor gets scammed.

There is no economic incentive for miners to do that unless Coinbase is willing to pay more than they are doing, because the demand for transaction inclusion always exists or there would not be a "full block" problem.


A single on-chain tx in this form costs as much as multiple small ones if fees purely go by the size. And Coinbase is more of an exchange than a payment processor, their customers will demand settlements anytime they want, and that's arguably one of the reasons why they are more vocal than Bitpay in this issue.

The important difference is really with P2SH, scripts with a proper amount of entropy will not be exposed to people not involved in the contract itself and cannot be brute-forced feasibly without being executed by those who knew about the contract.

It makes little sense to me: if, say, as they described, each Santander account will correspond to an Ethereum account, what would happen if a blockchain transaction is confirmed while the corresponding bank transaction doesn't pass the bank's check? Or are they going to encapsulate all the bank's internal checks in a smart contract? In which case, the entire AML ruleset used to scrutinize the transactions will be made public, something the banks/regulators have been doing everything in their power to protect and very likely illegal, The whole anti-money laundering system works on the premise of zero transparency and total arbitrariness aka 'reign of terror'.
If, otoh, say the blockchain tx will only take place if it's signed by a bank key as well, then does that mean once it's confirmed it cannot be reversed? Which is completely contradictory to how banks operate/fighting suspicious or illegal activities. Besides what benefits it offers over just freaking sign a bank statement upon request which they have been refusing to do despite being greatly in demand and mature technology for more than 30 years?

The inability for many so-called 'Bitcoin maximalists' to come up with proper, technical criticism of rival systems/altcoins bothers me, as if their confidence in Bitcoin stems from wishful thinking and blindness, rather than proper study of alts.
The whole secret of Ripple's 'fast confirmation'(for the native currency XRP, rather than alternative tokens, of course if a decentralized consensus protocol without using PoW and confirms fast is possible, it alone would be a major blow to Bitcoin! ) can be boiled down to this paragraph in their '[consensus whitepaper]( "Unique Node List (UNL): Each server, s, maintains
a unique node list, which is a set of other
servers that s queries when determining consensus.
Only the votes of the other members of the
UNL of s are considered when determining consensus
(as opposed to every node on the network).
Thus the UNL represents a subset of the network
which when taken collectively, is “trusted” by s
to not collude in an attempt to defraud the network.
Note that this definition of “trust” does not
require that each individual member of the UNL
be trusted (see section 3.2).", in short, each server will have a local consensus among the nodes it trusts, rather than a global consensus that doesn't rely on trust like Bitcoin.
So what would happen if two transacting parties do not share the same UNL? The Ripple protocol requires that they will share a subset big enough to prevent forks between their UNLs, this sounds good on paper, but note that banking started as disparate, spontaneous network building that was decentralized in the beginning, much in the same manner as RIpple, yet it's only human nature that the trust connections on the social network will eventually transform into a topology that centralizes around some backbone links(e.g., a Chinese farmer wants to buy seeds from a U.S company, their banks have never dealt with each other directly, the reason they accept each other's credits is they share a trust link that goes between one of China and U.S's national banks), especially consider, that the lower bound requirement on the size of the shared trusted server subset would lead to many 'let's both trust anyone we can find so we can finish this transaction' scenarios.

Your ignorance lies in basic database knowledge, the bottleneck is all about the locks, which validating historical transactions doesn't involve because there would be no concurrent access. Oracle is not making multi-billion dollars a year for no reason.


Guess what, it's fully possible to prune anyone else's transactions and only download/keep those needed to validate the node runner's own, and the whole chain would still validate. And more importantly, there is no point in archiving blocks if I only care about my own, once you finish validating, just prune everything away and keep the UTXO set.

Segwit can generate saving in block space as long as two transacting nodes and the majority of hashrate are supporting it, the security in which case, however, is only a tad better than SPV, with the growth of the number of supporting full nodes, it becomes more and more secure to use Segwit.
However, it's worth pointing out that the alternative to use a hard fork to increase block size also needs the same kind of majority hashrate support to expand the block size on the main chain, only in which case it's very likely much less secure than Segwit without the majority of non-mining nodes support, as you could be on a different chain than the economic majority. If the businesses accepting bitcoins, exchanges, wallet service providers...are not on your chain, the coins you get on that chain is worthless. So in a way, we can say, a **HF** is really what can only offer scaling when **the majority of economy** upgrades.

Because the  node runners are so generous towards us, then let's go ahead and abuse their hospitality!
EDIT: some people apparently think full node owners for their own sake have to keep everyone's transactions, not really, e.g., everyone could just run a fully pruned node once they finish the chain validation.
And I hope people go take a look at the kind of cluster and database software payment processors use to support high transaction rate, nobody is going to be impressed by your improvement from 7 tps to 70 tps, they will just laugh at you, cause you are still only able to support a fraction of what a decent payment processor is capable of, meanwhile you would lose most of your full nodes.
EDIT: Zander's ignorance lies in basic database knowledge, apparently he believes that real-time validation and validating historical transactions are about the same thing. Actually the bottleneck of a database is all about the locks, which validating historical transactions doesn't involve because there would be no concurrent access. Oracle is not making multi-billion dollars a year for no reason.

I suspect that part of the reason Bitmain is trying so hard to block Segwit and create their own fork, is that they are freaking out over the coming privacy enhancements, so perhaps the plan with Bcash is to, stick to their so-called 'Satoshi's original vision', and no further tech improvements.

So it can be pretty much identical to Bitcoin P2SH.
Obviously, parties who have access to both contracts can easily emulate the execution process and use an appropriate amount of gas etc.
So, in which case, must a person sending ethers to a contract account knows about the code of the subcontract as well?  Isn't the called code potentially supposed to do all sorts of things with the newly received balance, like creating tokens for it? Or maybe you can state whether the subcontract code should be revealed in the calling parent contract?

While indeed only a few devs have write access to the codebase, everyone in this world can read it, and free to raise questions/debates anywhere if they see anything going wrong, the devs thus will be forced to provide reasonable explanations, in which case if they fail to do, anyone in the world can create a new fork, and get others to use their fork purely by merits.
And in case you think "nobody will look at the code anyway", you are wrong, we are one of the most paranoid bunches in the world, we noticed it when one dev introduced a controversial yet really minor [change]( into the bitcoind package of just one Linux distribution, had something fishy gone into the crucial part of the Bitcoin core code, you can count on the person responsible for it to not have an easy time.
Btw, the bitcoin core devs are not exactly a harmonious group which can create and execute a conspiracy, they are highly polarized(I consider it healthy), many of them hostile to one another, any wrongdoing by one dev would certainly be used by his rival as ammunition against him.
TL;DR It maybe easy to write something into the codebase, but that doesn't mean the "Bitcoin protocol" is changed, you have to convince the network at large to to use your modified protocol, which is the really difficult part.

Because the whitepaper defines Bitcoin and thus takes precedence, and a forum post/Email by him doesn't?(The Bitcoin spec once out will be set in stone and even himself cannot change it) Which is also usually in conflict with his other forum posts/Emails. But yeah, I will take back that part about 'no given text', thank you very much, you always learn something new each day.


So they will by the cluster of centralized payment processors and their million-dollar database software, which will be able to handle several orders of magnitude more txs once our full nodes reach VISA-scale processing capability today. Comparing with scientific computing is nonsense btw, processing onchain txs over a certain limit by a single node **requires** expensive and professional databases not available to free software users and monopolized by a few companies, not to say scientific computing is an entirely different business from money which every single user of Bitcoin must take care for his own.


Oh yes, Ethereum is a centrally controlled network by the foundation, the nodes accepted a HF code that contains random numbers(DAO refund addresses) which they cannot even check whether is in agreement with the rest of the network, in such cases you have to blindly trust the developers and also the Github are telling you the truth, saying otherwise would be blatantly bending the truth.

The OP was talking about what Satoshi defined as Bitcoin, which has nothing whatsoever to do with what you said given the texts we have, which confirm that Satoshi wanted a network mostly made up of full nodes. At best, you are being off-topic.




Bitcoin Core only develops full node clients, they do not and can not make policies to help the network attracting users of non-full node clients, if you want people to dictate policies on you, go elsewhere. r/dollar maybe?

"Bitcoin: A **Peer-to-Peer** Electronic Cash System"
"A **purely peer-to-peer** version of electronic cash would allow online
payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
financial institution. "
People either haven't read the white paper carefully or just conveniently ignore it/handwave it for whatever reasons, I can't imagine how grossly careless it would have to be in the first case, as Satoshi emphasizes more than once that the payment system must be, and obviously only innovative because it's 'peer-to-peer'. Now what's P2P/Peer to Peer? Whether you look up its academic definition or the networks widely considered to be P2P in the real world, the meaning is unequivocally 'every node in the network uses and contributes resource to the network equally.' In other words, if the Bitcoin is not run mainly consisted of such full nodes, it will stop being Bitcoin by such definition. If the network because mostly made up of SPV nodes leeching resources from a number of super nodes and don't give back, the network would cease to be 'Bitcoin' by the white paper's definition. This is Mike Hearn's vision, big blockers who disagree with him mostly envision a utopic future in which the number of full nodes would just grow exponentially with the number of users, which according to the historical change of full node numbers was never the case.

You need to understand that MW's scaling capability comes at either of the following two conditions:
1. People use multi input multi output txs much more than they do with txs using just a few outputs.
2. Or maybe you are talking about the Mimblewimble on steroid researched by andytoshi which uses a sort of cut-through scaling that can merge all the txs over the blocks and downscale the entire chain to the size of the UTXO set, in which case it must be pointed out this process involves BLS signatures from pairing cryptography, which both uses a more untested cryptographic security assumption than the ECDSA of Bitcoin-vanilla(GDH vs ECDLP alone IIRC ), and is an order of magnitude slower than ECDSA to process(10k sigs/sec vs 100k sigs/sec in ECDSA's case), which given its potential in scalability is arguably more important.
In fact, even the vanilla form of MW is weakened in security in a number of aspects, it cannot support P2SH which downgrades its security to P2PK level, which along with the pairing cryptography do not offer the kind of preliminary resistance against quantum computing and sudden breakthrough in EC cryptoanalysis that P2SH offers. It's also functionally weakened in a number of ways, pretty much zero support for scripts(aka smart contracts) and efficient multisig that MAST is going to offer.
Given all this, I think it's pretty clear which niche spot each fills, Bitcoin for large value txs for which security are very important, MW as a sidechain for small value txs and privacy. You would most likely move your bitcoins into MW for a short period and merge them back into large amount outputs on the main chain at the end of it.

Your own node. if it already supports Segwit,  would reject blocks that include txs that spend Segwit-locked outputs without a segregated signature, so if the miners want to be able to have those outputs stolen, they would have to convince the majority of the economy to mark those transactions valid again, which is effectively a hard fork.

All talk, no substance, what say does non-mining node have over this? If they could somehow decide it, you bet sybil nodes would be spun up to manipulate it as much as possible, which is effectively costless. Eventually the blocksize will still be what the most well connected large miners can handle, which will put the Chinese at a disadvantage.


the community doesn't work together(it doesn't even exist on a large scale as 'a community' is basically a trust network), miners want to drive other miners out of business and will do everything to make it happen, which is the premise beneath Bitcoin.

Wow, the only way you could measure if you are a 'minority' or not, is via the hashrate, so eventually, either the nodes still have no say at all by being pressed into following the majority hashrate fork, or risk ending up randomly on a minority fork. FWIW, a third alternative that could have really given influence to nodes is for them to be able to ascertain which fork has the support of the non-mining economic majority, which is impossible. The whole design is just pretentious sham.


That's a pretty impressive depth of acceptance I must say.

^ The above was what you said about who gets to decide blocksize under BU, and presumably what BU officially advertises as well, while in fact, as you stated, if you don't want to end up on a minority fork randomly, you have to set your AD ridiculously high, nodes thus don't factually have any influence over the blocksize(all the control is centralized within the miners), it's effectively a blocksize adjustment via softfork.

I don't personally like miners just merge whatever consensual changes from Core or any other possible dev team, that would imply a degree of coordination and possibly collusion, which is bad for decentralization. And I also don't think it's a good thing that they give up their own idea about consensus rules under peer pressure or the risk of getting orphaned, however nonsensual their reason for protesting maybe. So Segwit's rollout would be a long-drawn out process if it's sensible, IMO.
After the SF is successful, seeing substantial size reduction would be quite straightforward, as exchanges occupy much of the on-chain tx volume and once they migrate to Segwit, blocksize reduction would be immediate.

Feudalism was the original form of decentralized governance(not saying it's good), when the king had much less power over his subjects than national governments today, thus some of the medieval kingdoms had the 'outlaw' system because the law was simply not that effective at getting those who broke it. Centralization became a trend sometime around the Enlightenment when nation states started to be formed and therefore immensely increasing the power of governments.

I think you are being a bit overly ambitious in the design, thus the fee paying problem in the original forum post. If we change the threat model a bit: not every miner needs to be kept in the unknown, the tx could be revealed to a small time miner whom under normal circumstances wouldn't risk mining the censored tx lest the cartel orphans his block, then we could improve the censorship resistance from 51% of the hashrate to something like 100% minus a non-negligible percentage, which is still good.

Lol, you are the one with 0 idea.
Even if we ignore that Chinese stock market is nothing better than an altcoin market full of pump and dump Ponzi schemes, the performance/profits of SOEs are entirely unrelated to their stock prices(Yes they do pay dividends but guess where do these money came from :P), what I was talking about is the state monopolizes these industries, so private money has no chance to enter and compete with the SOEs, you are by definition a sucker if you still choose to invest in their stocks(pump-and-dump scheme) when they don't need to give you 0 fuck about their stock performance, the SOEs are state funded(taxpayers' money), and if they are deep in red the state banks are gonna finance them with zero-interest loans anyway(savers' money), why should they give a damn? The fact is most of the SOE stock investors were total losers, and wise investors stay away from them. 
Still, if you consider pyramid schemes and MLM(Chuanxiao) valid means of investments, I guess you can count them in.

It is. Again, the challenger could add whatever date or name he likes, but it's not up to the prover to decide, the prover has to sign whatever text the validator requests, not changing it a single bit, that's it.
In other words, if Gavin requested to add "CSW" on himself, that would be fine, but Craig should not be allowed to make such a proposal if Gavin didn't say so.
The 'oracle' in cryptography is imagined as a black box for which the validator has no knowledge of its inside working, so the tricks in the code has already been accounted for in the model. It's exactly because the blackbox maybe tinkered to output a positive result when the input includes "CSW", that the input has to be made utterly unpredictable to the prover.

It has not been restated enough, but with a SF, you are fully entitled to not use, say, Segwit, if you don't want.Sending txs in the old style would, needless to say, work as before. While accepting Segwit txs you would have weakened security as in this case only the miner, and potentially other nodes on the network are there to guarantee you the tx is valid, so you could opt to not accept txs spending Segwit outputs directly. For txs not directly spending Segwit outputs, but somehow 'tainted' by them, other coins mixing with segwit coins are essentially an approval of its validity, especially if they have considerable coin age.
It's worth noting that not using Segwit also allows you to significantly reduce the data load on your full node if you store all the blocks, all in all, I consider giving users a choice an overall positive(with a HF it's upgrade or your coins are worthless), thus I prefer a SF over a HF.

 LE can have enough man power to sybil attack the entire network when the number of nodes is too small. Also there is really no defense if they can just collect information about every IP ever goes on the network and data-mine and inter-correlate all the stuff to find a lead, the only defense is like in Tor's case, when the number of users is too big that they don't have enough budget to go after everyone.

there is a status icon on the left of a transaction which shows its status, if it's something like a square, and you can't find the txid on any third-party website then it's not relayed, do a "reset the blockchain" will clear this tx, none of your funds will be spent.

The problem I see with the article is that only those coins that are being spent  and thus provide fees for the block makers and create economic activities are what matter to the miners and other stakeholders, the coins being hodl indefinitely otoh incur a cost on the network as a necessary expense to maintain the last line of defense, and do not by definition represent the economic majority, in the same way gold being buried underground are not part of the economy.
A way to counter is for the long-time hodlers to spend a small portion of their coins to take part in coinvoting/polling, at the end of the day it's the days destroyed that matters, as long as your coins are 'old' enough you could still gain an advantage.

Bitcoin Core is not a public good, you are actually putting the Core devs in the position of making decisions for the network, and if anything, this sort of thinking is what gives them undue influence they shouldn't have.

The blockchain is designed to enable people with different political/non-economical agendas to be able to reach consensus purely based on monetary motivations.
The banks, which have became political more than financial organizations, are unlikely to allow anything superseding their political agendas(e.g., what if Russia/Chinese bank miners want to confirm a tx to Syria but US bank miners reject it?), there would be frequent forks, and a blockchain is unworkable in this environment. And even if it is, it will probably be many fragemented, regional network/blockchains, an Eurozone one here, a North American one there, much like the internet 20 years ago, which has long been proven to be infinitely inferior than a global internet. Moreover, as [xkcd]( and the history of banking itself can tell us, once people stop adhering to a global standard and get fragementized, there will only be more fragmentations, in the end, they would probably end in a turmoil of all sorts of payment/money transfer chains, that is not really too different from the turmoil of payment industry today.
Perhaps more importantly, the principle on which the banks are founded on is entirely contradictory to that of Bitcoin-banks make profits by limiting your access to their network,  a closely connected network between a small number of entities providing credits to each other, is how banks came to be historically and remain are. Anyone who wants to access their 'infrastructure' has to go through one of the banks, your business cost will have to price in their expenses and profits in the first place, which curbs competition. Bitcoin, otoh, allows anyone to use/profit from the network, or be a bare-metal level network participant processing payments if you can beat others in an arguably much freer market competition. I would think it's fair to say if the banks adopt Bitcoin's way of doing business they are just not banks anymore.

get out of your bubble already, Bitcoin as a layer 1 system cannot hold a candle to the existing centralized payment systems in regulation-freindly countries, no matter how much you raise the blocksize. Alipay/Wechat e.g., are each processing 50k tps in China, people nowadays can fling red envelopes back and forth as if they are sending normal messages and buy everything from their breakfast to condoms with Wechat on a phone. Accepting payments with Alipay/Wechat for your online/brick-and-mortar shop has literally 0 cost and businesses frankly wouldn't see a need for Bitcoin even if you raise the blocksize to 20 MB. The reason why businesses like Bitpay and Coinbase succeeded in the U.S has much to thank to the stone age regulation over there(why Paypal is dead), and such success cannot be replicated in nations where such regulations are not in place.
The only hope Bitcoin has to compete with the centralized payment systems thus far is LN, which Gavin didn't bother to read up on until very recently. He is both naive and ignorant.
@_date: 2016-05-24 09:32:53
The so-called 'mining centralization" problem has very little to do with ASIC vs GPU, which is a red herring, when it comes to hashing, we are probably at the best time in Bitcoin's history, there are numerous big and small hashers, yet most of them are individually strong enough to be self-sustaining ((e.g., take a look at all the people who took part in mining the last 5,000 blocks on [F2Pool]( the real issues are:
1. the geographical concentration of miners in China, which has to do with its abundance of cheap electricity, an advantage wouldn't go away by switching back to GPU, because. well, GPU mining is a electricity hog all the same; 
2. the necessity of using pools to reduce variance forces miners to give away part of their autonomy, which has been proven time and again to rear its ugly head in all altcoins as well, until people can figure out a way to incentivize miners to use something like P2Pool, the undue influence of pools on mining is likely to last as well.
Finally, all contentious hard forks are supposed to be opposed, a hard fork that changes PoW is by all means as contentious, if not more, than one that changes the blocksize.

FYI why that particular diatribe about backdated PGP keys totally misses the point and is wrong: the hash algorithms did exist before 2009 and was labelled with the same numbers, but the particular order they appear in the ciphersuite list was not(8 2 9 10 11). Unless Satoshi had a brain-sync with the developer of ~~PGP~~ GPG one year later and shared his particular [rationales]( developed under circumstances unknown a year before), there was simply no reason for Satoshi to order the algorithms in the same manner, especially for lower-priority hash algorithms which users who can access higher-priority algorithms simply don't need to care about.

It's a clever title, but I don't think he is being accurate here, note that holders always have a collective power to balance the miners, notably described [here]( however I don't think even LN goes far enough to make the case that Bitcoin is going to use PoS, because PoS specifically describes a consensus mechanism that determines the longest chain via stake voting.

Your anonymity set is the fundamental limitation, e.g., proving you have made communication with some one at certain times is enough to get a court order to break into your house and seize your computer, may very well be when you are typing your messages. Because you have too few nodes, they could very easily build a time pattern of your communications, time windows when only two IPs are using the network. There is also a variety of other ways to gain enough information about you.


Of course we are talking about side-channel attacks, once LEs decide to put enough resources on one guy behind a certain IP, they could just not need to prove his guilt through breaking the crypto **at all**.

Lol, me as well. And I was wondering why the heck is a Westerner so fired up over this issue.


The state controls the supply, but so far they seem to run out of tricks to control the demand, people go as far as 假离婚 to acquire properties.


Sure, but guess what, nothing can crash as fast as the RMB printing machine, there is enough demand from on paper super wealthy people alone for properties in major cities, I never said the real estate market will not crash overall though. And judging by other nations' experience, the major city property bubble is probably going to last. Hong Kong has been in a housing bubble since...forever, plus Tokyo, plus New York. It will end once most fellow Chinese people realize that it ain't so cool to live in a metropolis.

There is no short supply of wealthy people in China(in the sense that they own large amount of probably worthless bank ledger tokens), but means of investment, the state basically monopolizes the oil industry, power grid, telecommunication, supply of land....you name it. In fact, a property in a major city is one of a few things in this country that is actually worth something, for the simple reason that most of the talented people are within driving distance to you and there are plenty of opportunities(employment, business), and there is at least a resemblance of rule of law and modern healthcare in the major cities.

It's my own understanding that these coins' fungibility should not and cannot be protected under a possible QC attack.
Therefore I proposed that once we are fairly sure QC could become a reality in a few years, we would start a SF to make sure that once past a certain point, all P2PK coins can only be spent to a certain type of address, support of which is disabled by default on all wallets and must be enabled manually, so anyone accepting those early coins are aware of the risks themselves.
It's worth noting that nodes had similar discretions during every SF, e.g., they could have chosen to not upgrade to P2SH and not accepting coins from outputs locked up in P2SH addresses, or coins from Segwit outputs, so I believe this is at least something worth discussing.
@_date: 2016-05-23 22:50:56


Don't give anyone too much credit, the consensus is upheld by the network nodes without which the devs are powerless, 4 months have passed and you are left with 800 of them, the result is quite convincing. (I haven't stated if I can accept a 2MB HF, rather, show me the consensus, I would go wherever consensus is.)
Free market gets torn into pieces when the state comes with their big sticks, and that's why we need decentralization to exist to protect the free market, and decentralization itself cannot be sustained with free market alone, in which strong players inevitably come to dominate the market and centralized things, whom then went on to be neutralized by the states.

While any tx from an early address purportedly to be sent by Craig Wright could still in no way prove he is Satoshi, this post raises the possibility that Craig Wright could have not controlled any early coins and still produced such a 'proof'. This is a fundamental weakness  of "proving by making transactions": the message being signed is not controlled by the challenger, and such a signature does not even constitute an actual proof that anybody pointing to such a tx as a proof of key ownership controls the key at all.
With a bit more resource, someone can, e.g.,  hack the WiFi the real holder of some bitcoin keys connect to, and intercept his tx, then make an public announcement that he is going to prove he is instead the holder of the keys associated with certain addresses by making a tx from said addresses at a certain time, then release the tx at the prescheduled time. Such an attack is not pulled often because it doesn't give the attacker real control of the coins and is thus useless, however when the identity of the key holder is a lucrative target of theft, the cost of pulling such an attack could become justifiable.

This has nothing to do with the "onslaught of ASICs." There are hundreds of hashers out there, when it comes to hashing it's hardly "highly centralized"(e.g., take a look at all the people who mined the last 5,000 blocks on [F2Pool]( what gives a few people undue influence is pooling, which is somehow centralized both in all altcoins and in pre-ASIC Bitcoin,  this problem cannot be mitigated until people find a good way to encourage most of the miners to join something like P2Pool.

They don't care so much about the survival in the long term, they care about what in their mind can maximize their profits, which is very often not in alignment with the interest of Bitcoin itself.say you are already barely at break-even and post-halving you would bankrupt anyway, so how about just take a gamble, you could reap more short-term benefits that way. Over the course of Bitcoin's history we have frequently seen large but less efficient miners being pushed out of the market by upcoming but more efficient miners, the large miners could have well decided to raise the block reward once and make as much as possible before their certain doom.
More importantly, if there are not that many nodes out there insist on validating, we couldn't even know if they have inflated the supply.

It could be a semi-P2P fiat-Bitcoin trading scenario, the bitcoins being traded are escrowed in a 2-of-3 multisig with the arbitrator controlling the third key.


In which case, the recipient may deny the reception of such a message to the arbitrating third-party.


Yes, but if they cannot distinguish a bitcoin-buying transfer from a normal one they will have to pretty much scrutinize every bank transfer.
Nevertheless, there are admittedly several ways to correlate a bank account with TLSNotary usage: due to the homomorphic creation of the PMS, there is a noticeable pattern present in the PMS plaintext(read: reduced amount of entropy to a still acceptable level), so banks could identify if an account is being accessed with TLSNotary by searching for such patterns. We have came up with a way to create 100% indistinguishable PMS, but since it's hand-rolled crypto, it's turned off by default unless(unlikely) we can get a proper crypto review for it.


Absolutely agreed.
@_date: 2016-07-12 15:20:06


Name one of them instead of using hearsay.
IIRC, Bitcoin is supposed to be a "P2P electronic payment system", while being P2P requires most if not all the nodes to be equal peers of the network, with each being able to function independently(think e.g., Bittorrent).  A number of big blockers apparently think it's a good idea to have a client/server network instead of P2P one in which a large number of SPV wallets have to rely on a few datacenter nodes to process/verify their transactions, and access the blockchain. It's those people who betray the whitepaper's original vision if there is any.
@_date: 2016-07-01 09:04:38

1.There is no point producing a new version of a historical document, which could eventually confuse things enough that people end up having different versions of the whitepaper.
2.Who has the authority to amend it if it really is to be done? And what process must be gone through to settle the differences in opinions? Have we not have enough pointless wars of words already?
3.If our message is really "The whitepaper is not important but the active network that is maintained by the consensus", changing the whitepaper is in contradiction with such a statement and demonstrates our lack of confidence.
4.The whitepaper IMO still catches the spirit of the current implementation of Bitcoin, and in some ways the ideal state of it. The Platonic 'node' that Satoshi defined is not in widespread use anymore, but it is a very good educational abstractive object that helps you understand the fundamental working principles of Bitcoin.

There are interesting comparable phenomenons in China, for a Westerner.
There are almost 0 cases of Chinese banks restricting domestic fund transfers, and even new accounts can make large cash withdrawals because there is just so much liquidity in the banking system(which is partially the reason why 419 scams are very prevalent in China, scammers can set up an account and withdraw millions of yuans of scammed funds in cash the next day). 
So it's probably by all means futile to stop people trading bitcoins because even if the banks start cracking down on trading, people can just trade in cash just fine, in fact, OTC bitcoin trading is a thriving industry in China(not using LBTC, btw)
Additionally there are other very popular and hard to regulate money movement system, Alipay, Wechat, there are numerous gambling groups in Wechat with turnovers in millions of yuans per day, would be quite easy if someone just wants to launder money through them.

Yeah, guess what, with sidechain implemented, you can have nodes who want bigger blocks moving to a big-block chain with their bitcoins pegged, they can tune the block size to however large they want, without the nodes maintaining the base consensus layer being affected, and none of Bitcoin's fundamental properties being threatened.(inflation control, censorship-resistance, security...) And you can freely pursue whatever agenda you like on the sidechain(VISA-scale onchain tx volume, financial inclusion of 3rd world people...) and be protected by Bitcoin's blockchain at the same time.

Hashing power is voting power wrt the decision of which txs get to be included in a block, but not wrt the rules of the network. The latter just doesn't make sense theoretically: if hashing power can vote to change the rules, what would you say if the majority of them vote against the 'one-CPU-one-vote' rule itself? It's self-defeating and thus will turn Bitcoin into a mathematically inconsistent system, aka not Bitcoin. Satoshi ain't that stupid man.

However as long as the fees don't make up a significant part of their block income the pressure to include transactions are always mostly social or has to do with China's GFW. In fact many pools/miners were very reluctant to increase the block size initially, F2Pool for one, being one of the most vocal advocate of 2Mb HF nowadays, mined 50k blocks for a while at the beginning of 2014(when inside GFW mining share was not the majority yet), if miners were to make purely free-market driven rational decisions, they would probably all be mining very small blocks these days.

But the problem is, like superpowers during the cold war, stakeholders in Bitcoin may make wrong moves thanks to the unavailability of good quality information, especially through a cultural barrier. For example, miners could be misled to believe the majority of the network is in support of a HF(because its supporters are particularly vocal on the social networks without committing any resource), while in reality it's the opposite. Many HF opponents seem to be under the mistaken belief that miners are not gonna take irrational actions which will destroy their own incomes, such a scenario however is well within the realm of possibilities.
The worst outcome of a HF is that the two forked chains have sufficient number of conflicting transactions to be remerged back into one chain, in which case we could say Bitcoin is dead.

Maybe look at it in another way, Bitcoin has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of international payment/settlement, break the banking cartel, and after LN rolls out, create a really efficient machine-to-machine network of value. All these can benefit the common people, help them saving money without them really owning any bitcoins, so I believe it would be a win-win situation eventually.
Besides I don't believe our wealth distribution situation is as desperate as the fiat world really, most of the large value address you probably saw belong to the exchanges/online wallets holding them for others, it's a ugly situation but there is hope that eventually they will be dispersed back to their legal owners, and LN could also help this process.

I always laughed at the idea that a Chinese government crackdown on Chinese miners will somehow spell the end of Bitcoin.
While my countrymen are known for their unwillingness to stand up in the face of an oppressive government, this is only true when there is no money to be made, a profitable business opportunity will make many of them ignoring all sorts of laws(stealing electricity for example to push down the cost) and regulations in the world and risk even the danger of death to fall over each other to be in the business. A government crackdown would not stop mining, when there wasn't Bitcoin mining, peasants just used the electricity to build illegal aluminium smelters all over the place.

While showing appreciation occasionally is nice and they rightly deserve it, I should point out that Bitcoin is strong because many of us don't trust anyone out there, as the principle of operation of Bitcoin dictates. The developers while generally being highly professional and principal people in my opinion, cannot be trusted as well, thus I would recommend the general admiration of their work must be moderated and not cultivated, and non-personal, informative scrutiny and criticism must be encouraged. The consequence of trusting the developers too much is not well understood, but can plainly be seen in the HF of the other currency: most node operators/miners blindly accept the code given to them, not realizing that had the developers included different refund contract addresses for clients downloaded by different people, the network could very well split irrevocably.

Software developers need to satisfy the need of nobody but their own users, I thought this is common sense(you are a dev yourself!). By trying to help out SPV wallet users(even if it does help) through sacrificing their own users, they are reducing their own userbase to grow other software's userbase, which is completely illogical and ridiculous to expect from them. And such demands have not been seen for developers of any other software AFAIK.

There is no way to reach a Nakamoto consensus on any refund address without putting them on the blockchain, which would be a rollback and suicidal(as a feature), you would have to **trust** the developers to give everyone the correct and the same address, and modify the UTXO set accordingly.
That's the fundamental reason why any refund via a fork cannot be done.
@_date: 2016-07-11 13:10:13


Well if you put it that way, then bar the MITM scenario, yes, you can say you are protected. However that would also make harassing you much easier, the network produces orphaned blocks every once in a while, a single malicious full node can pick up the orphaned chain and all utxo-commitment using nodes connected to it wouldn't be able to tell if something really went wrong or are they just being spammed. 


See above, the fact that this is almost always the case has much to do with how counterproductive attacking would be from the attackers' point of view.

Reading an academic paper like this is usually more about a few things other than knowledge:
1. The jargons, every subject has them, understand the meaning of most of them that appeared repetitively in most of the literatures, and why were they even created. Jargons were usually constructed upon simpler words with new meanings added, if you can find some simpler words, and then tell the differences between jargons and those words, you would understand the jargons, and with that you would find most crypto literatures become a lot easier because they share a common vocabulary. E.g., most of them talk about playing a 'game', and there is a 'prover' and a 'verifier', with the meaning of 'proof' slightly different from its usual meaning, and we have something called a 'commitment'...
The definition of most of these words can be found on cryptographic textbooks, there are many free ones that are great, but too mathematic(like the one by Goldwasser), non-free ones are usually easier to read, like the 'Applied Cryptography' by Bruce Schenier. My advice is to pick one that is broad and covers as many topics as possible.
2. Try to get to the important part, the reason why an academic paper looks daunting and overwhelming is because it uses long paragraphs to do things that will allow it to be published -proving its theory is correct, but we very often don't care about this part-the OP's paper for example, it goes to some lengths to describe how Bitcoin works using a mathematical model, his proof has to be based on that, you don't need that, you already know it, and all the cryptographic assumptions and premises under which his theory holds, together probably accounts for 70-80% of the paper. What we want to read most is the author's creative contributions, the new stuff he found and how they make things work, which is pretty well summarized in page 11-16, much less workload for you then.

boosted by random feeler connections farther away. This allows a node to maintain routing state
with space complexity logarithmic with respect to total network size, while ensuring reachability to
all other nodes with high probability.

Scams come and go, also VC frenzies, and political campaigns, in this chaotic world, people can change their attitudes a hundred times in a year, they could get hyped by the scams, pumps, then disappointed, then feeling betrayed and deceived, starting to despise Bitcoin, get furious over it for the scams' faults, cursing it, predicting its death, forgetting about it, most of them will complete this cycle. It doesn't matter. Eventually, someday, they will have a desperate need to do something which cannot be accomplished without Bitcoin, and that will be the day they find, to their dismay or delight or whatever, that Bitcoin is still there, giving zero damn about their past emotional fluctuations, ready to be useful, because Bitcoin survives and remain silent.

Dunno what you are saying, seems very likely you don't too.
1.Miners don't necessarily get paid per block mined(e.g., they sell contracts or use pools with certain reward distribution algorithms), so the point of halving would be irrelevant;
2.Miners don't necessarily incur new expenses for each new block mined, so the point of halving would be irrelevant;
3.Even if the above two cases are false, their effective cost very often varies between blocks, e.g., they recoup their sunk cost during the 25 BTC period, which is a significant portion of the total cost;
4.the speculation on the hashrate change.
For most of them, it simply makes no sense to shutdown at the last block.

@_date: 2016-07-18 17:23:11
One of my friends have an interesting theory, that 'money' is actually the antithesis of 'community', in the sense that 'community' implies a trust relationship, yet the more people trust each other, the less they need money, money is needed when you can't take the other person's words for it. And that's how market economy conquered the earth, people who cannot trust each other can work together, collaborate together, thanks to money.
However, fiat money and its banking system doesn't remove the need for trust, they just turn to use a multi-layer trust network to move values. This means that being in the periphery of the network,  individuals are only to be trusted by the financial institutions through the links connecting us to them.  This model becomes problematic when some of us become more and more internationalized, so their profiling of us stops working because they have moved far from their original positions in the network, especially when their new identities start to dominate the ones they originally used to build the trust links. Yes in many places banks have started adopting information technology as an important authentication factor, but they are never thorough in this aspect afaik, their last line of defense is always the trust established on the ground. Probably has to do with their fundamental way of thinking.

Yes, the Ethereum blockchain is doing what a blockchain should do, serving as a testament to this cheating, because blockchains are designed to do tons of collateral damage to make any rollback extremely impractical, they have to settle with the state change.
@_date: 2016-07-05 18:08:43
From the perspective of LN users, the first problem should be managed by making sure the total size of all channels are smaller than the average of empty block spaces, rather than total block spaces, in each's own settlement cycle. This part of the reason why while I am against big-blockism, I don't agree with some Core devs' "blocks should always be full" philosophy as well, an ideal state should be some blocks must be full, but overall they are like 80%-90% full.
The second problem doesn't seem like a big deal to me as I don't think big liquidity institutions will centralize the topology. While they have much larger bitcoin balances to open channels with, they cannot compete with the freelancing ideologistic introvert nerds out there when it comes to the price. Joinmarket shows us that geeks are willing to charge only as few as a few satoshis per tx if it means the coins come without effort and social interactions, while businesses would have to incur expenses for any new service they provide. As long as the combined liquidity of small time LN nodes can exceed that of the big players, the centralization risk is overplayed.
@_date: 2016-07-08 11:18:05
By some definitions you are right, by some other definitions, P2P basically means you use the resource of the network and at the same time give back, aka BitTorrent, eDonkey, so as long as the network still largely consist of full nodes it can be classified as P2P.
It should also be noted that to a large tract of reddit posters, 'P2P' apparently means you can pull out a phone and swipe up to make payments, no matter how many third-party services' help you have to seek in the process, thus the strange belief that only a Bitcoin network in which a large number of SPV clients serviced by a few data center nodes can be considered a 'P2P electronic payment system' per 'Satoshi's original vision'.

Regardless of whether you prune, you need to go through a lengthy and painful IBD process when you set the node up, and UTXO set alone simply does not suffice for accounting purposes, less archival nodes on the network also means a few high-capacity nodes could centralize the service of initial syncing, and refuse new nodes' access to the blockchain selectively. 
2. If I recall correctly, it's you who argued that 2Mb would make spam attacks more difficult to disrupt normal transactions, and cited it as one of the reasons to support a blocksize bump, now if that were the case, surely any space that is left would be filled by low-fee txs(no matter what are their natures) that could not make it into 1Mb blocks currently? So the block size would still be nearly full? 
But in any case, what's a Ethhead doing here with his so far unprunable Ethereum blockchain+world state?
@_date: 2016-07-10 12:02:49
The simple fact that you do not calculate the cost for each block separately?
@_date: 2016-07-17 13:16:16
I am pretty sure their job and legal duty don't involve buying data from those sorts of services that setting up nodes listening and correlating the transactions of every Bitcoin user they can, including non-Coinbase users. Yeah, there is nothing illegal and unexpected about this sort of attack, but same applies to the reddit posts that call them out for being dicks.
@_date: 2016-07-04 10:33:23


To this day we see proof that blocksize-limit != blocksize. As blocks are still not completely full
It came from nobody but Mr Roger Ver himself that all sorts of companies would be so happy to rush to take advantage of all the new cheap block space.
Needless to say, the only thing that can be worse, is how the UTXO set size will bloat thanks to all the blockchain businesses flocking back to Bitcoin to use our blockchain to store all their craps.
The blocksize limit is actually what's keeping them at bay, as these businesses shun away from the Bitcoin blockchain, what's left are users with genuine needs for Bitcoin and therefore their demand has not filled up the block space, yet.
Feigning that blocksize-limit !=blocksize would be border on disingenuity.
Also your argument displays the same sort of naivety and fundamental misunderstanding of security engineering similar to the xthin supporters' vehement denial upon the discovery of their design's vulnerability to birthday attack. Even if something is not happening due to socio-economic reasons, it doesn't mean you shouldn't put things in place to eliminate it if it's practically possible, however unlikely it maybe, because RL capacity is always, very often significantly lower than the theoretical design, and your adversary is almost always better than you imagined.

I am pretty regretting the title, in fact, reversing a tx is not even what the ETH people did, what they did was sending the tokens to a different address, which is not doable whether there is a longer chain or not.


Not quite true in the sense that blocks orphaning other blocks usually share same set of txs, and even orphaned txs are reconfirmed shortly afterwards as they are still in the mempool.

Lol, without going into theory stuff, let me tell you i am a seller on a Bitcoin marketplace who has done several hundred Bitcoin for bank transfer trades, and I reached my conclusion by the constant experiment, test, probing, and triggering of the flagging system of our banks by me and numerous others(we have established best practices that we provide to the buyers which can help them avoid getting flagged), rather than by imagination.
And no conspiracy is required, it's just the nature of doing business in a connection-based credit network. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 21:02:51
The fiat transfer goes from the buyer to the seller directly(or it wouldn't be considered decentralized), what Bitsquare allows is in case there is suspicion of buyer fraud, the arbitrator can intervene and request a Pagesigner(TLSNotary) proof which can cryptographically prove the bank transfer has been made, while fraudsters would be unable to submit a proof that can pass the audit, and in which case the arbitrator would not release the bitcoins in the multisig address. Of course, it doesn't prevent bank reversal of transfers, so they have to be mitigated, but not eliminated by other countermeasures.
@_date: 2016-07-17 14:05:24


The snooping thing= doxing.


Nah, every bank has their own filtering system, which have all sorts of their own add-ons and bonus checks, the law only requires the minimum.(For example the law most surely doesn't ask you to suspend all accounts that send transfers with the ref "Bitcoin", but many banks do).
@_date: 2016-07-04 13:21:42


Entire? You must be aware of SatoshiDice I guess? If they did not back down under social pressures, well, they could have certainly filled up entire blocks.


Bitcoin works because socio-economic reasons. That's what it is build upon.
As I said, under socio-economic conditions the RL strength is weaker than theoretical strength, that's why theoretical design must have limits that are stronger. Also the socio-economic argument is a strawman, Everything depends on socioeconomic conditions, but that doesn't mean "Bitcoin works because socio-economic reasons", which is exclusive, Bitcoin works because of a lot of reasons, socio-economic ones are just some of them.


There never has been a greater good, and Bitcoin thrives because none of us trust each other and we don't need to.


Satoshi said you don't trust, no matter what. Instead, you verify to the maximum, however with 51% of the miners collude a new node(not just any node) can be fooled still with maximum verification, that doesn't imply you trust the miners.


Wtf you talking about, relaying threshold has always been lower than block inclusion threshold as a matter of fact.


By whom? A blacklist? Fees are the only viable measure in a permissionless system.


Not designing a system that does arbitrary computation has the upper hand, which also makes static analysis possible.

If that were the case he would not sell until much later. I meant, if I am reasoning purely from a speculative point of view, the take away is if you can just throw $50 in it and forget about it why not...

The funniest bit is that they are demanding angrily the developers of full node software to introduce a change that will force their users to stop using the software. :)
@_date: 2016-07-06 12:27:00


As developers of full node software, why would Bitcoin Core devs be expected to introduce changes that will inevitably reduce their own userbase? This is like one of the most ridiculous demand ever.
Client-only wallets and SPV and so on are not users of Bitcoin Core's software but factually leeching resource off Core users' nodes, what is the basis for them to expect Bitcoin Core(who has no intention whatsoever to get into the SPV business) to do anything for them?
It's nobody but exactly the big blockers putting Core devs in positions with political influence, instead of just client software devs.

Same dude said coupla days ago that in case of a DAO event in Bitcoin he would support rolling back the chain. *shrugs*
However this appears to be a decision that should receive significant backing within Bitmain, not just him, probably as a way to exert pressure on the meeting to be held, I don't know.

Protip to all the experts in the field: don't talk about mining if you are not sure about what you are saying, you would be wrong.
A case in point: the influence of price fluctuation and halving on most Chinese miner's income are separated, with the price fluctuation barely has any impact at all. At least in China most miners hedge on the exchanges against Bitcoin, their revenue was thus pretty much locked in the whole period of their business operation. Halving otoh, does have some impacts, but since it's a predictable event they can be priced in! Miners are not gonna wake up in the morning and yell :" ZOMG ITS HALVING TODAY SCRAP ALL THE MINERS NOW" It's quite funny how many pundits out there were eager to point out how the halving should have been already priced in by the investors, but not the miners, while in actuality the pricing in is much easier for the latter.
The biggest enemy/risk factor for the miners, is probably the growth in the network hashrate, which has time and again proven to be unpredictable. If only Bitcoin mining was more centralized, and actually only controlled by a dozen individuals, we would not have this headache....

I don't disagree with you, if you are someone who understands Bitcoin it's massively more convenient than traditional channels. If you are not...well that's why the old remitter businesses have not gone bankrupt.

Many talk about Bitcoin's deflationary property as a bad thing, little do they realize how incredibly difficult it's to engineer a system which can enforce the deflation.
The halving is indeed an achievement to celebrate, to remind the world that for another 4 years, Bitcoin has been working **as expected**, a rare sight in this chaotic human world.

 While I am completely not satisfied with the situation that Theymos personally manages four major portals of Bitcoin information, it's anybody's freedom to participate in a particular subreddit, nobody forces you to be here to discuss,  it's not a public property and public power is not abused, if you don't like the moderation policy, go somewhere else. Meanwhile I should remind you, there are many many more subreddits with comparably sized communities and much stricter moderation policies.
Additionally, who do you think you are, Coinbase? You are merely a service some people use to purchase and store their bitcoins and nothing else. We didn't elect you to voice for us our opinions towards r/bitcoin, know your place or your users would vote with their feet.

They are already doing so in the UK, where a large traction of online Bitcoin tradings are done on a marketplace called bitbargain.co.uk. As sellers we receive fiat payments on our own bank accounts for bitcoins with the site being in custody of the bitcoins when the trade is open. The bank is very Draconian towards Bitcoin, e.g. putting "Bitcoin" in the ref of the transfer is enough to get your bank accounts suspended, so all sellers need to get trained for circumventing Bank blockade and pass an exam before they can sell, buyers are also repeatedly warned everywhere on the site. So far the site has been running almost 4 years, sold tons of coins and in general is a great success.
@_date: 2016-07-24 12:50:21


Well first, unlike Ethereum, Bitcoin scales past a subreddit and a forum long time ago(saying this as a retail seller with hundreds of trades and being in Bitcoin for more than 5 years), even if this sub is focused on the whole thing(which I doubt), the Bitcoin economy definitely isn't.
And second, $10-15 is like 2% of Bitcoin price, while ETHC has caused ETH price to slide by 9-10%, hehehe...
But overall, I am struggling to see why you are going on and on about all this while I was just making an investment advice, I can't see any relation.

Show me where in Coinbase's user agreement that stated they should agree to be spied on, not just complying with the regulations, but be spied on.


Let's see if Coinbase agrees.
 &gt;That said, I think Ethereum is ahead of Bitcoin in many ways and represents the bleeding edge of digital currency. 
 &gt;At the end of the day, I have no allegiance to any particular network; I just want whatever brings the most benefit to the world.
 &gt;Ethereum may attempt to move to proof of stake. This would be a huge breakthrough if it works as it would eliminate the need for proof of work and all of the hardware and electricity use that goes with it, but also presents a large risk. I believe this risk is manageable because there would be extensive testing beforehand.

While more liquidity is certainly good, it should be pointed out the value of Bitsquare lies in providing a Mad Max doomsday global regulatory crackdown trading option. So it's not really fair to use liquidity and other metrics commonly used to evaluate other trading platforms to evaluate Bitsquare.

Bitcoin Core is rightly following Satoshi whitepaper's original vision by defending the "P2P" nature of the "P2P electronic payment system", which requires most of, if not every client to function as a full node by making a portion of their resources available, instead of as SPV clients which have to rely on third parties to access the blockchain.
And yes, Bitcoin is an "electronic payment" system, but Satoshi never said anywhere in the whitepaper that Bitcoin should be a electronic payment system that is cheap to use.
@_date: 2016-07-17 13:46:15


Or you know what, telling users right after their deposit/they made their orders, that we do not welcome you, please leave, would be so much better than locking up their coins and make other sorts of random harassments, they are essentially adopting a bank-like approach here, which experience shows are usually more draconian than regulators require.
And regardless, you are being OT, OP was talking about that Coinbase did nothing wrong other than being forced to comply with the regulators' requests, and I was pointing out that it's probably false, as they indeed went out of their way to dox their users(which many other exchanges/wallets don't do).


It's precisely an attack in Bitcoin's privacy model, in the same sense that a "51% attack" is an attack.

I knew, but now you(and maybe someone else) are using it with a positive tone, supposedly you should have provided a reasonable positive definition(what it is as opposed to what it is not), or it runs a risk of becoming a rhetoric instrument to rally people to a cause that can be manipulated to the liking of its promoter, because it is not defined in the first place.
Bottom line: how should I decide if I can personally identify with it or not?
