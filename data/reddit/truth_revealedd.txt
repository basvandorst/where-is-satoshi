This stupid meme fails to acknowledge the fact that had one single wallet bought 12.8 million Satoshis in 2010...then there is no way BTC price would be what it is today. If one wallet controls over 2/3 of the entire Bitcoin supply, then the price would not be able to jump as swiftly. Of course, buying 12.8 million Satoshis is still a much better investment for $999 than buying that price of shit Apple stand but the return on investment certainly wouldn’t be the same as it is today. It would be a small fraction...maybe $300-400 at the most .

In “family guy what the hell does rant mean” fashion, what the hell is a 30 day?

Very quiet day. Does anybody buy this notion that $21,820,000,000 = 21.82 BILLION USD worth of Bitcoin were traded among all the exchanges in the past 24 hours, at least according to CoinMarketCap? I believe CoinMarketCap is one of the most reliable accurate sources of cryptocurrency trading data. However, I still don’t believe that this $21.82 billion volume of Bitcoin was actually exchanged as a form of currency. I believe the true volume of BTC for the purpose of currency is $900 mill which would be less than 5% of the actual volume. Currency is defined as a medium of exchange. We can damn be sure that people in the past 24 hours did not transfer $21.82 billion worth of BTC. Most BTC today is traded as a form of investment not currency. But on top of that, volume manipulation has been incredibly significant on even slow days like today. Volume manipulation in addition to price manipulation is an intrinsic part of cryptocurrency. Any trader who uses increased volume as their rationale for buying this market is deluding themselves. There’s no FUCKING WAY $21.82 billion of BTC were exchanged for the purpose of buying shit through BTC. Bitcoin’s daily volume is almost as fake as Tether...and I say almost.

Price prediction for 2020.
I’m not trying to create FUD or FOMO. I’m just trying to make a very realistic prediction on BTC’s price for 2020.  Now obviously no one factor can accurately predict the spontaneous manipulation by whales which today accounts for 80-90% of Bitcoin’s price. The best measure for BTC’s price is natural price growth and greater adoption, not volatility. I am primarily using the 2016 year for my price prediction for 2020. 
I believe that BTC price will reach the same levels in mid-2020 as it did in mid-2019 - the $13-$15K price range in anticipation of the halving. After the May 2020 halving, I believe likewise the 2nd half of 2019, the 2nd half of 2020 will be pretty uneventful until the last 2 months (Nov-Dec 2020) where we see much more steady natural growth on the way to eclipsing a new high just over $20K in January 2021. I believe it will take about 13 months for BTC to triple from today’s price and reach a new all-time high around $20.5K. I do NOT see 2021 being the next bull run barring any major regulatory change.
As for the 6-digit price of $100K, I think we are at least 4-5 years away from that price and that will be impacted more by institutional investors, for example via SEC acceptance of a Bitcoin ETF. Bitcoin’s price will not naturally rise to the trillion-$ market cap for a very long time. I think too many people are so anxious for the next bull run that they are underestimating the amount of time it takes for it to occur. Everyone thought 2015 was going to be the next bull run but it didn’t happen until 2017. Likewise, the next big bull run will not happen in 2021 nor will it mimic the duration and volatility of 2017. Every bull run is different. There’s still the mere possibility that BTC could collapse to $0 like other great inventions where the whales would crash it for good and everyone would lose complete confidence. But I believe that theory is less likely to happen at least anytime soon than BTC hitting $1 million soon. This is why during these times, it’s important to stay level-headed, be patient, stop checking prices and think strictly in the longer-term 5-year and beyond forecast.

This thread is laughable.

How do you TLDR what you said? It was only 4 sentences.

How did you lose $1500? Did you buy the dip and sell at a bigger dip? Could you elaborate please?

And on the 400th time, Bitcoin actually died!

No that’s a falsehood. Robots clearly do not eat pizza. They just drink diesel... I think.

Dude if you only have $10 to buy BTC or even $100, DON’T BUY BITCOIN. Only buy BTC with the money you can afford to lose. Unless you’re living with your parents or have some secondary income supporting you, you should not be buying BTC if you’re living paycheck to paycheck.

I think it’s amazing how people can generate FOMO out of thin air. Dubai is buying BTC. Ehh no dude, Dubai is buying more Indian and Bangladesh slaves to work for them and build their shithole slave civilization. They don’t buy BTC. Maybe the government of Saudi Arabia secretly buys BTC but Muslims in Arab countries aren’t thinking...ooooh gotta buy some BTC today. They’re thinking Allah. It’s amazing how some awful news source like Cane Island Crypto can generate absolute FOMO straight out of their asses.
“It’s Sunday morning in Dubai. 1st day of the work week in Muslim countries. And the first thing they did when they got to work was buy

The $9000 was clearly a bull trap you dummies. I’ve been calling it all last week. I was 100% right so I win. I enjoy watching you FOMO suckers bleed hard.

Honestly hate hanging around this subreddit listening to amateurs making Bitcoin predictions or having to look at some trendy bitcoin pic or meme (see that stupid Bitcoin is my pet cat). I feel this entire subreddit is full of losers who lost money in BTC and their only consolation is getting hipster laughter over the shit that’s posted in here. If you people are the HODLers, it gives me no hope in BTC. This entire subreddit feels like a low-budgeted community outreach center...except it’s all virtual so it’s less than that. I don’t think any serious Bitcoiner hangs around these subreddit. It’s full of suckers that will buy just about anything they hear.

Sumo Bro you’re asking the wrong questions. The correct question is...how was the pizza? Was it delicious? Did you experience the Itis and feel sleepy after eating it? And what did you drink with it?
Those are the questions we want to know.

I knew this post was bullshit from its clickbait title alone. A small country like Bulgaria holding nearly 1/5 the number of BTCs as Satoshi Nakamoto? Okay is this an Onion article? This is deliberately made up FOMO garbage. Buy BTC because Bulgaria fictionally has 200K worth roughly $1.7 billion USD. Lol.. in the case I heard the Chronicles of Narnia own about 22 million BTC and the Guardians of Galaxy has about 10 million BTC. I’m sure even the Wizard of Oz has lots of Bitcoin but the wealthiest Bitcoiner is actually Smaug from Lord of the Rings. That greedy dragon has 6 kazillion bitcoins. He has so much, you have to use a makeup number.

So why tell all? Again real HODLers don’t need to tell about how they HODL every fucking day. They just HODL. Fake HODLers will tell about how strong of a HODL that they are. But as soon as they experience massive FUD, they prove that they are weak and they sell. Cir2kuk sounds like the latter.

Stupidest thing ever. The fact that he failed to mention EOS just shows how incompetent he is.
