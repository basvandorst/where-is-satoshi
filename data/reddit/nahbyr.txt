Try smaller amounts first or try a bot with a small amount?
Not saying to continue using the bot, just to learn from it. See when it buys and when it sells, try to figure out why and how.

Wish I had cash to invest, but just bought a house, so very low on cash atm.
@_date: 2018-02-23 17:05:31
Ok. My idea was to invest what I mine and keep my cash for day-to-day things.
This way the most I can lose is the electricity I put into mining.
This does mean you start off slow, with barely any noteworthy profit though

Which exchange(s) do you guys watch for BTC/USD?
@_date: 2018-02-24 21:35:43
I have that one open and Coinigy on Bitfinex.
Those 2 appear to have the most information as far as I can tell, but wasn't sure if those are decent.

What's going on? It's dropping so fast!
@_date: 2018-02-23 15:26:52
Just a random question: How many of you are miners (bit- or altcoin).
@_date: 2018-02-23 15:35:55
I'm planning to get into trading soon. I've been watching, learning and reading a lot the last month and a half. Got my Bittrex account yesterday, so I'm just waiting for a moment to make some investments.
Was just wondering if and how many are actual miners (small or more advanced).
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:36:33
I meant it more as in influential people within the BTC scene. Like I said, I'm pretty new.
I kept track of BTC for a couple years, but mainly when something big came up in the news. Started mining on my old gpu just 5 weeks ago. So I'm a noob when it comes to the community.
I've actually been thinking about a project lately. I'm a web dev and I've got a great idea for an app. I've always had a mentality of asking for donations rather than payment. I might start mentioning it there.
Thanks for the info!

I'm fairly new to cryptocurrencies (and Reddit, so not sure if this is the right place). 
What got me the most is the high price of a full coin and the large decimal numbers that are pretty much worthless.
I was thinking today, wouldn't it be better to use/trade Satoshis instead of Bitcoins? I think it would lower the entry level for new people. It's also psychological.
Look at it like this, which is easier to calculate and which sounds better to have?
You have 0.000090 BTC or you have 9,000 Satoshis.
Now try this, how much USD is this if you know that 1 BTC is 11148.64 USD and 1000 Satoshi is 11 cents?
Yes, currently a single Satoshi is worth close to nothing in USD, but let's hope BTC price will increase to the point where 1 Satoshi is actually worth something right?
Both are the same, roughly 1 dollar, but  the Satoshi one sounds more satisfying (round numbers sound and 'feel' better, also it feels like you 'get more') than the BTC amount.
Just the observation of someone new to the cryptocurrency field. Would love to hear what you guys have to say about this.

That's nice. So only the initial investment of the gpu's minus what you made with the currencies.
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:26:02
Question: at what amount of cash or BTC does it make sense to daytrade? 50 USD worth of BTC at a 1% gain would net you 50 cents. Minus transaction fees. For example.
I don't have cash to invest right now, but I'm mining my way up. Was just wondering when to get into it.
I like making my own luck rather than HODL'ing and relying on others. And in the end, if I screw up and lose it all, then I've lost nothing but the electricity.
@_date: 2018-02-23 16:05:22
I live in Europe. Electricity is cheap if you forget about the fixed costs you have in a normal household anyway (fee for using the net, stuff like that).
I'm currently only mining on an old 980ti, so it's slow. But I plan to use what I get from that to start trading and checking if I have what it takes to trade (and be profitable).
@_date: 2018-02-20 00:44:03
I actually had no idea that this had already been tried.
Like I said, I had been thinking about it today and thought I'd ask. You never know when you have a great idea that's so simple, people just don't come up with it.
I think it's worth a shot to give it another try, but I have no idea who to contact to talk about this or how to go about it. Reddit seemed like a great place to start.
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:20:40
Buy the dip! That's the only positive part about this.
Now just need to find a way to get cash.
@_date: 2018-02-20 00:34:01
As I see it there are 2 ways, change it programmatically or change the way we pay/trade. If we stop displaying values in BTC and start displaying them in Satoshis then it's up to the trading markets/websites/apps/whatever. They're likely to change because it will work in their own best interest.
Changing it programmatically is harder. But would ensure wide-spread (forced - I don't like this) adoption and be more fool-proof (smarter minds than me will have figured out how to do it). It would have to be a change to BTC and not just another alt-coin.

You invest the earnings in crypto? Not in expanding your mining operation?
@_date: 2018-02-23 17:08:05
I heat half my house with my gpu atm. Good insulation means I can keep the ambient temp just from mining at 20-ish C.
It's not as cold out here though. Atm it's just dipping below freezing.
I can imagine that you'd need more than a single gpu with temps at -21C
Another pro for mining!

Went down 4.6% on Bitfinex. Going back up now
@_date: 2018-02-20 00:24:02
I know how it works, I'm just thinking about possibilities. If you lower the entry point for new people, more people will join, bring in more money and ultimately grow the adoption of cryptocurrencies.
Isn't the goal to get BTC accepted by the mainstream? If this means adapting, then why not? Ultimately BTC itself won't change.

I hope you're talking about the new Roadster and not the old one?
If you're talking about the old one then you're probably better off with a P100D or the like.
The old Roadster only did 0-60 in roughly 4s.
And I'm with you on the Lambos suck part. I would much rather have a Tesla than a Lambo.

Or whenever the candles change colour?
