I find myself spending less there every year that goes by. Now if Amazon were to accept Bitcoins that would be a whole different story.

No I do not. Didn't even think of this possibility. Thank you for telling me about this.

Well to me Newegg's level of service has dropped immensely since I first started shopping with them. For the past 2-3 years now I find myself shopping at Amazon even if their prices are slightly more expensive. Any trouble with an item I have (DOA, not delivered, pack stolen) they pay for return shipping if they need to me ship item to them and ship me a new item. A few times they said to keep the item because they shipped it by mistake. 
Every return or DOA replacement I have ever had to do with Newegg result in me paying a return shipping and sometimes a restocking fee. That is really the part I hate about Newegg especially when an item arrives DOA. Some people say you to can argue until you get them to cover the shipping cost, but I do not want to waste my time with that when there is another company that will not make me jump through hoops.

I do and it is awesome. One stupidly long random and secure password more than 24 characters to protect every password I own in keypass. Although I should think about changing the master pass. Been the same for a year now. Just so hard to remember the new random pass.

Fiat is national currency, e.g the US Dollar or Japanese Yen.
