I already have an account that gets the $10 but I can't sign up for a new one :(

Bought at 225 when the premium was at most 5%
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:40:38
I'm digging the premium tbh
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:27:18
Well they're also holding the BCC so the premium is not as high as it seems to be. Also BTC has dropped that much - like in July when it sank below 2k - and GBTC still holds the premium fairly well.

I'm so jealous
@_date: 2017-07-13 17:05:52
Thats not the guy holding the sign
@_date: 2017-07-13 18:47:50
The guy on the right is the one who raised the sign

Besides the premium associated with accessibility, and other tax avoidance premiums, to what do you associate the disconnect between GBTC (1 share = 0.1 BTC and at market close on 5/31/17 was $484.05) and BTC itself (where 0.1 at 12am on 6/1/17 was ~$230)?
**Please note:** for any speculators, there is no easy way to transfer 0.1 BTC into a share of GBTC or vice versa - thus no arbitrage opportunities. GBTC is perhaps the easiest method for most typical investors though.

Above 100? What is this 2010?
@_date: 2013-08-24 13:59:35
Could someone please comment on this that the SR accounts for only about 4% of all BTC transactions. It's killing me that I can't tell him
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:16:35
I would, I just don't have the capitol.
@_date: 2013-08-01 17:17:49
How old are you? Maybe there is an under 21 cutoff
@_date: 2013-08-26 20:29:12
Are you still handing out bitcents?
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:29:04
Oh no I totally agree. It's an interesting idea though.

The fact that all of this text is slightly misaligned makes me question this document....
@_date: 2013-07-15 14:02:44
Source? I'd love to post those all over my town and school.
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:17:54
Couldn't you take the bitcoins off of it?
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:26:02
Will those 100 always be in physical form? Could you not import them?
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:54:11
So if you had started mining the moment bitcoins became active and hadn't stopped since then, how much would you have accumulated?
@_date: 2013-08-26 20:29:49
Where'd you get the stamp?
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:46:12
Isn't there an alt coin where coins are devalued if they are not spent? Isn't this what that is trying to prevent?
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:17:20
No, I found it, look up Freicoin.
@_date: 2013-08-24 14:02:50
Can someone also comment that the US government recently recognized BTC as a legitimate currency?
@_date: 2013-07-15 14:21:54
Thanks!
