For what you want you need price stability.  Bitcoin was designed around system stability not value stability.  So, the value stability can only come from higher valuations because of supply and demand.  What you want is linked to price whether you like it or not.

Do this.  It is a good idea.  also, put around 7% of weekly check in 401K, max out a Roth IRA each year your eligible, use a 529 college account for kids, and be sure to utilize any investment programs if you work for a large company.  Do that for 20 years and you won't be sorry.  You will be living off interest comfortably.

They are saying the OTC market is 2-3 times larger than the exchange market or close to $12B.  I don't think they are right.  
The main reason is (as the article points out) the volume on the Bitcoin blockchain is around 100,000/day ($1B @ $10K).  When you do an OTC trade you don't have it sitting in the OTC account.  You only move it in when ready to limit risk.  So, at a minimum you should hit the Bitcoin blockchain once and probably twice when it is received by OTC exchange and moved to the buyer.
Can someone explain how the Bitcoin blockchain chain would not see these transactions?

I don't think it is reasonable that many transactions trade private keys.  Maybe they use a hardware wallet to do it, but this seems like it would not be the norm.  The OTC desk may hold the coins but like I said in my OP you do not have large amounts sitting in that account (to limit risk).  You move it when it is necessary from a secure location (no trust).

I was referring to 100% secure from the digital world when done properly.  Cannot be stolen from a hacker.  Of course you can still have the cold storage key stolen, extortion, torture, etc.  I don't think that concerns most people though.  Those exists with anything of value and are not unique to btc.  However, btc does have some ways to guard against them such as multi sigs, splitting private key in half, etc

It has limited supply.  It is math based and programmable allowing for it to have native automated integration into anything.  Oh yea, almost forgot the network and the currency are one in the same.

Yeah the community might suck here I don't really know.  But I am a part of it so that has to count for something right?!  
The thing is anyone who is smart and wants Bitcoin to succeed should realize you can't hide what it is.  Any real issues should be made well known and addressed.  There is no avoiding them.  Down voting real issues and concerns is just immature and defeats the purpose of this sub imo.

This.  Be more liquid.  Use what you have to buy what you can and immediately buy back what you use.  Net loss of BTC is zero and you support the vendors who are accepting (directly or indirectly).  Using something like Gyft you actually come out ahead because you get 3% back.

Ask him how/why it is a ponzi scheme/scam.  People with this view have very little knowledge of what bitcoin is and take that position because it is the easiest position to take with little to no knowledge on the subject. As he answers your question it will lead to discussion about what bitcoin really is.  If he is smart he will start to see the truth. If he is not then he may never see the truth and if/when he does it will be after main stream adoption. Also keep in mind he may not care to know the truth.

As the customer I am spending bitcoin to buy the a gift card.  So, I am making a purchase with bitcoin first then making a purchase with the gift card actually.  The point is I can spend BTC to get what I want. Whether it is directly or indirectly (through a 3rd party like Gyft) was not the point.  Back to the originally post - I was just pointing out that bitcoin is very "spendable" if you choose to use it that way (at least in the US).

It is always funny to me when I see whales on here.  Whales in bitcoin our minnows in the stock market.  If/when bitcoin starts to get whales you will see $10 million dollar orders daily.  There are very few whales in the bitcoin space currently.   Quite frankly a whale could come in a buy up all the liquidity in most exchanges if setup properly and they wanted too.  
Lets take bitstamp for example: currently if a true whale came in and put down a $15 million market order they would raise the price over $1100.  Im not saying this would be smart to do.  It is unlikely a whale would ever do this right now because the volume is way to small (although you could argue that it would completely flip the mood and create a rally).  The point is the fun is just beginning.  As the infrastructure continues to built $100 swings will be the norm until MUCH more volume enters the market.
I remember when we used to go crazy over a $1 change.  After all the early adopters  with 1K BTC were making $1K!  Craziness!

Right.  Just like not reporting sales tax for amazon purchased items is a crime.  I'm not advocating this nor did I ever say I was for it just seems to be very grey area on when you  "spend" btc and what that purpose was, to whom, etc.  No "property" in the history of taxed properties has ever been so mobile/borderless.  I was only pointing out this is fairly simple to make it look legit and probably with a little studying you could make it actually legit through a loophole of some type.  Remember many rich people pay very low taxes but they are not doing anything illegal they just exploit a very flawed system and I'm sure exploits will exist here.

What if you do not actually take the losses.  For example say that I buy 10 btc at 500 then send them to a different address at 450 each.  I have now "lost" $500 - tax deductible.  No one knows if I control the address I sent them to so that really doesn't matter.  Then the price goes back to $500 and I "buy" them back from the "person" I sent them to.  Now I have 10 at $500 again.  Price drops and I repeat.  Reporting losses in each case even though i had control of them the entire time.  Point is you can't prove I didn't send them to someone else for some service then buy them back.

This is a misunderstanding of the technology and/or terminology.  Bitcoin, the blockchain technology, is near impossible (or very difficult) to hack.

The private key is embedded/printed on something that exists in the physical world.  The private key is tamper proof meaning you cannot access it unless you reveal to everyone else that you accessed it (thus making it worthless).  This typically requires some level of trust from the creator of the physical bitcoin storage median that the key is printed on.  What may be accessible is the public key to fund the bitcoin address.  So, in theory any funds that are sent to the public key is the value of the physical unit being that the funds cannot be removed without accessing the tamper proof private key.

It doesn't have to cost anything.  Store a key in a safe at your house and a key at another trusted/secure location for redundancy.  You are not storing it in one location and it is not stored on a device.  It is stored on the blockchain.  All that matters is that you have the private key.

You act like the major companies that do accept BTC are not middleman.  That are just turning it into fiat too and that is fine.  The key here is for the people holding BTC to able to purchase what they need/want.  The utility of BTC creates value.  People who spend BTC will get more if they can buy what they want/need.  No need to get hung up right now on whether companies are turning BTC into fiat or not.  That will come later as vendors and employees start to accept/request btc.

What will the incentive be to continue processing bitcoin transactions (mining) after all coins are mined?
Will transaction costs rise much to make it profitable to keep "mining" even when there are no additional coins to mine?

Bitcoin is up 2739% over the past two.

Be patient and wait for some volatility to come back and buy on lows.  Incremental purchases mitigate risk vs current price.  Never sell.  Only use BTC to make purchases and immediately buy them back when you do.  Patience is key....just wait for weekly and monthly lows.  Keep in mind there is no magic formula this is just a strategy that I have found successful.
@_date: 2014-04-09 11:11:16
I'm not sure about the easily spendable part??  Are you in the US?  If you are you can spend at most major retailers through Gyft - Walmart, Target, Amazon, etc. Overstock and Tiger direct accept directly.  There really is not much you cannot buy using Bitcoin.  I realize Gyft is an extra step, but it is really not that big of a deal and you get 3% credit.  If I choose to I can now make all purchases using Bitcoin except food and gas.

This is not entirely true.  I have been involved in BTC for several years and what I look for more than anything is flaws in Bitcoin.  I am constantly in search of how and why it may fail.  I only downvote information that is inaccurate or not real concerns.  In many cases the OP's understanding and research was not done so they are not real issues.  If I find real issues I upvote them.  This is for obvious reasons... Real problems need real solutions and should be known.  If they are not real problems then it is just FUD and should be down voted imo.

The correct answer is not provable.  The best advice I can give you is to do some research on BTC, watch some videos (search bitcoin in youtube) and decide for yourself if you think bitcoin is the future and where you think the value should be.   Then sell or buy based on that.  
@_date: 2014-04-10 02:26:59

I think what you are asking is why do bitcoins have value?  That is a fair question.  Hopefully this will help 
@_date: 2014-02-18 22:55:34
I'm all for Dogecoin and several other alts.  In fact I think I will go buy some.  However, the philosophy in the article is easy when value is low.  I used to send several bitcoin to any friend that wanted to check it out back in 2011.  However, when the value increases like bitcoin has the value conquers all.  Decision making changes when value goes from $20 to $20000 it is just how it is.  If doge goes way up the same thing will happen just like it has with bitcoin.  You won't just send 1 doge if the value of 1 doge = $100.  You will stop and say oh shit I have a lot of value here.  I better be smart with this.

No need to over complicate it.  Setup cold storage wallet using OFFLINE system and then send btc there.  It is 100% secure.  Make redundancies of cold storage key (i.e. store in safety deposit box).
Edit:  100% secure when done properly... Which is fairly simple.

How many people were predicting the death of bitcoin back in March 2013? Predictions will be made on each side.  The history shows the truth.  Bitcoins chance of death is about equal to chance of the Internet dying.  It won't.  It will adopt and become what it needs to be because it is a technology that improves the entire world.  Just like the Internet has done.

I think this shows just how hard it is.  BTC anywhere in the world and any amount confirmed in 10 minutes.  Fiat 12-72 after a wire transfer which I would not consider easy by any means.  For me I have to physically go to my local bank to do this.
I agree that moving millions of BTC into $ is difficult.  I never stated otherwise.  I just pointed out that it's always more difficult to move fiat.  
Sure, massive volume exchanges that can do $100 million dollar transfers would be great, but it is not needed.  And when it is it will be available.  Right now if you did that the market would move like $300.  The demand for that type of volume is not here yet.  When/if that type of demand is here then the markets/exchanges will support it.  After all they make a percentage so they have every incentive to do so.

Nope this is the norm for startups/venture capitalism...that is where Bitcoin is right now.  The difference is this startup is unfolding in front the world.  Usually the world doesn't see the path that is taken to becoming the next "Apple" until it is an IPO and/or already leveled out on the s curve.
Edit: I realize btc is not a company.  This is just an analogy.  btc has more potential than any company.

I just went through an audit on mytrezor.com to test removing btc from my trezor every 3 months.  It failed.  The site locked up on every attempt.  I may have made a mistake of updating to the latest firmware first thing (they seem to have some bugs).  But in my defense it was running really slow before I updated also.  Anyhow I am going to post r/trezor.  Just figured I would let you know.  Pretty annoying especially if I needed the BTC quickly.

@_date: 2016-01-28 03:18:09
I'm not sure I totally follow.  In theory if the hashing power didn't change at all and the bitcoin price goes to $1000. Wouldn't everything still be just as secure as it is now?
I guess you are just saying that would never happen because more hashing power will come online because the incentive increased.  However, we have seen hashing power increase exponentially and price stay relatively the same, between $200 and $500, for almost a year.  Doesn't that counter your presumption?
I'm not necessarily questioning your logic.  I'm just trying to understand it.

Segwit does not change the blocksize parameter (correct??).  So, it is correct to say the block size parameter is changing for 1 MB to 2 MB.  Even though the actual blocksize can be greater 2-8 MB) due to segwit.   Regardless we are really talking about block weight which has a relationship to size but not necesarrily the same.
In reality we are talking about seeing 2 MB blocks with segwit only OR 4 MB blocks with segwit2X.  It is unlikley we will actually see 8MB blocks.  Correct?

It is up to you on what you want to buy.  Just do your research.  Bitcoin (BTC) is still Bitcoin if that is what you want.  BCash is similar but the major differences are it removes segwit and increases blocksize to 8 MB.

Making it illegal does not necessarily drop value or use.  In addition, bitcoin is priced against several fiat and other digital currencies (not just the dollar).  It's value is in the technology and defined rules around the system.  It is known what it is and a choice to use it or not.  We can't say that about any fiat system.
@_date: 2017-08-01 02:55:35
What's wrong with just increasing to 2 MB?  I've been around a long time so don't down vote me to hell.  It just seems this really wouldn't be that big of a deal.  It's no long term solution but it helps in the short term and everyone is happy.. Sorta.  We can all worry about more important things.

Either would be risky and I would not be comfortable with that lack of diversification with my life savings.  However, If I was going to do this I would prefer BTC at current prices.  I see it as a better risk/reward (less risky for what you have to gain).

You are not understanding my point.  The OP was about what BTC was worth back in the day and selling into fiat.  
All I'm saying is you COULD of understood what Bitcoin is back then and understand the potential future value.  That understanding is not luck.  That is why Bitcoin grew in value year of year and will continue to do so.   And when I say Bitcoin that pretty goes for all the decentralized blockchain projects with solid dev teams and community.
You point out the affect of speculation with has nothing to do with what I'm talking.  Absolutely there is speculation but that is not where the REAL value comes from.

The two are linked.  You don't change the world with a $1 BTC when supply is limited to 21M.  $21M won't do shit.  
I think you still may be missing the point.  
It is very likely that it wasn't luck if you held back in the day and then made more the 5000CAD.  Most likely you understood what this technology is and that's why you didn't sell all your BTC when you made a few thousand.  Quite frankly people with this understanding and belief (there is a lot) never sell for fiat.  At least not the majority of holdings.  Because in time you won't have to.

This really doesn't make sense.  First of all they would make WAY more money if the price just goes up.  They are mining the coin.  The higher the price the more they make.  It doesn't help them to push out medium/small miners.  Also, they sell to miners!!! Lots of them.  They want medium and small mining operations to buy there old miners.  People won't do that if they aren't making money.  So, basically everything you are saying is the complete opposite.  The biggest miners want the price to go up and they want everyone else to be mining and buying there old miners.

While entertaining, that's actually not a very good analogy.  Cows exploding would be luck. 
For Bitcoin Hodling is not just a meme it is about understanding what the technology is and its potential future value to the world.  This can be understood and believed and to some extent known.  That is why people HODL.  It is not out of pure speculation.  If it was they would just get scared and sell.  It is because they "get it" and Believe.  
Bitcoins growing value has nothing to do with luck.   It comes from a decentralized system that has never existed before allowing permissionless transfer of any amount of value to anywhere with a defined amount of transferable tokens. 
If you truly understood this then maybe you sell a little cause you made a few thousand but you keep the majority in this world changing innovation.
@_date: 2018-06-26 12:18:33
I was joking...hence the smile at the end.  Seriously though, it's a circular argument.  BTC will never be widely adopted because it is too volatile.  BTC volatility will greatly decrease when it is widely adopted.  
We have already seen decreases in volatility over the life of BTC.  I expect that trend to continue and finally resting on a very stable price with low ROI/speculation.  At that point primary use is store of value and a currency.

Just don't buy at all time highs.  It's a simple rule that would have stopped someone from buying at $18K.  On the flip side you would be buying now at over 50% below the ATH.

Not that your wrong, but the argument you make is  circular.
Bitcoin is too volatile so we can not use for everyday purchases.  Volatility is greatly reduced when it is used for everyday purchases.
Current volatility is not a problem it is just the required path to reach the stability for everyday purchases and a stable price.

The answer is no.  The same Bitcoin can not be in two different wallets and confirmed on the blockchain.  The only explanation is that it is different Bitcoin or they are the same wallet/seed/private keys.  If someone knows other possibilities please share.

Well you may be right on both accounts.  I probably didn't give the anology enough thought.

It's a tricky thing to share the best way to secure a seed.  By sharing the information you likely make the method less secure.  
So, all I would say is use a Trezor.  Buy one for you wife also.  Teach her how to use it.  She will have access if needed.  Assuming you trust her this is a good method.  The reality is she will probably never touch it because you are around.  But if you die she will have no issue accessing the btc.
Edit: you set up the same seed on both Trezor.  This also gives you redundancy if one Trezor is lost.

This statement is completely wrong from what I see.
The people who own the most Bitcoin already own it.  They owned it when it was worth nothing (or close to it) for philosophical reasons.  They never care to sell and it is completely different type of person than traditional rich people.  
The wealthiest will be nerds who went head first into Bitcoin before it was worth much of anything.  
The next line of wealth will be early adopters who saw it had some value then started buying when they took the time to understand it and started believing in the technology... Essentially more nerds.

Assuming Bitcoin continues to grow in popularity transactions will move to other chains (alt coins) OR primarily use 3rd parties (coinbase to coinbase) to fulfill daily transactions b/c it will not be cost effective on the Bitcoin blockchain.  Ultimately, it would really do nothing to hurt or help Bitcoin as far as functionality goes.  It will continue working as it is, however if it continues to grow the cost for getting a transaction on the chain could become quite large which I would say most poeple believe to be a bad thing.

Shutting down the internet for any length of time across the entire country would have catastrophic effects and cause a revolution.  It is unrealistic to think this is possible for any significant amount of time.
Edit: not to mention the DIY projects that would instantly be incentivised for a connection through tunnels, Ethernet cables from house to house etc.  You want to see innovation take down the internet and watch how people circumvent the control with current infrastructure.  It would be epic.  The great thing about technology is that it can not be uninvented.  At best it can only be temporarily disrupted.

Not at all.  Remember that the price of BTC 4 months ago was at an ATH of $5800.  The idea that BTC has crashed is simply false.  Year over year it continues to grow in hashrate, transactions, usability, and there is no reason to think that is going to change.  In fact, there has never been more reasons supporting that it will continue.

You don't hoard to drive up price to never spend.   Otherwise, there is no point in driving up price.  People will always spend when the value is right.  Price reaches an equilibrium of hodlers and spenders...many people like me will be doing both.  You just don't do it at the same time.

@_date: 2018-02-22 02:12:05
I have seen first hand that this theory is just plain wrong.
Why do people struggle to understand that noone KNOWS that the value is going to continue to increase.
If you KNEW it was going to always increase in value of course...  You HODL for as long as possible.  However, even then eventually you have plenty of money and don't care OR you need something and you buy regardless.
But since you don't KNOW, you will always spend at times because you feel the value is  worth it and it could drop or stay about the same for a long long long time...which is exactly what BTC is designed to do.  Reach a peak and plateau.  The volatility will slowly decrease over time and we are already seeing this.

Naw.  First off it couldn't go to $1.  Not realistically.  Too many people would buy at anything below $1K just out of novelty even if there is no utility...  Me included.  
Your second point is not valid either.  In all the major bull runs of BTC the price stabilized above previous ATHs.  This is still true.  It has to drop below $1200 to get below previous ATHs before the run of 2017.  So, if it does that the sentiment would change, but like I said people would buy just to own a piece of history if for nothing else.
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:37:53
Well that's not true.  You certainly don't want to draw conclusions based solely on history but history plays a role into the phsycology, allows for analysis that people use to make trade decisions, etc.  So, the past absolutely has an effect.  However, it would be unwise to draw conclusions from solely looking at the past b/c while it has some effect the past does not predict the future.
I think you are confusing affect vs prediction.  The past affects the future but the past does not predict the future.

You probably want to familiarize the trustee with the process to have access to the digital currency.  They does not mean they have access while you are alive.  But in the event of death they could be given the last 12 words of a seed or whatever process you choose to give them access to the funds.  You are trusting them to make good decisions for your children so this only makes sense as well.  Multisig 2 of 3 with a lawyer or other trusted entity could be an option as well.  They would have to collaborate to have access and keep in mind these are people you "trust" so the risk is minimal.

No. A significant part of lower transactions is not due to LN.

@_date: 2017-05-06 17:35:01
So this is how it is suppose to work, but in reality the IRS is not going to notice that JB sent BTC for a loan.  Nothing is triggered that they would monitor.  What they may notice is me selling the BTC to immediately to pay the loan and yet I don't owe any taxes.

You are not a loser if you sell.  Your are a loser if you sell for a loss.  It is wise to take gains especially to pay off debt.
@_date: 2017-05-26 01:14:32
If you say so.  I guess you KNOW that it can't go up to $5K and then "crash" back down to $3500 over the next week.  How do you know this???

Did you accidentally add the d to your username?




Very few actually sell at peaks and buy back in lower (like I said earlier - if you do  a it is luck) so that means almost everyone who sells later sees a higher price.  So to look at from the point of view that it is losing upside is a very unwise way to view.  Figure out the gains you want and the min. amount of Bitcoin you are ok with having.  If everything matches up then sell with no worries of losing the upside.






No one said anything about speculating with money needed in real life.  Just because you have debt does not mean you don't invest and speculate.  Most Americans owe money their house.  If your investments grow enough to pay off your house it is wise to do so.  Also, I never said I was saddled with debt.

Anyone who owns bitcoin or cares about its success is incentivized to come up with solutions to any problems that arise.  Some of the best programmers and smartest people in the world are supporting this experiment.  I'm not sure it would be wise to bet against them.

@_date: 2015-02-13 05:06:18
No, very unlikely.  A small possibility that I used that card to get verified back in the early days when Coinbase was new.  But I am  certain i never used that card to buy.  If I log in to Coinbase now (which works fine) that card is no where to be found.  My normal card is there as I would expect.  BTW the recurring buy did not go through.
@_date: 2017-07-11 15:06:24
Itbit can handle that volume.  
Edit: I used them with no issues.  Very good to work with.
@_date: 2015-02-13 04:42:55
So I have had a recurring buy on Coinbase for some time now.  Today when the buy came up I received this email.  The odd thing is these last four numbers are not the numbers on the card that I have on Coinbase.  But...it is the last 4 digits on a card I actually do have.  The thing is I haven't used that card in several months.. maybe years.  It is an old Bank of America card.  Then I go to log into Bank of America and they accept my login info but come up with no account associated to this user.  Something very odd is going on here -  how/why is Coinbase associated with or even looking at this card.  And what the hell happen to my account on BoA?  I will contact BoA in the morning, but figured I would share in case someone had similar issue or had any input.
Edit:  contacted BoA and they had shut down my account due to inactivity (didn't use card for several years).  I did use it to verify Coinbase early on.  So all is good.  Thanks to those who replied.

 I don't think this will be a real problem.  Too many variables and ways to store the seeds.  However, a simple solution is to store your key encrypted physically at your house.  Store encryption password digitally.  No worries if someone gets either one.  
Another smart move would be to store several seeds in the house.  All with little to no value except for one that is in the most difficult spot to find.  Stash a substantial (but OK with losing) amount on one of the easier ones so the thief thinks they got it...meanwhile the honey pot is safe.

I don't think you understand my reply.  I am not claiming that I know what will happen.  I had no prediction in the comment.  I am simply saying it is not a guess.  If it is truly a guess then why get involved?  Just go to Vegas.  But, for the record it is relatively clear to me that we will see Bitcoin break previous ATHs again.  When I am not sure, but I would say most likely in the next 3 yrs.  So, currently there a huge opportunity.  To say why I believe this is more of a report than a comment as it is a culmination of everything I previously mentioned.

If it's truly like Bitcoin then it is an alt coin. So, it will be no different than all the other alts with the only reason to use it would be integration with the bank which can easily be converted from other digital currencies on the fly.  I would not expect it to have much impact.  Also, if it is truly the same as Bitcoin then why don't they just use Bitcoin?  That might be the better question.
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:56:21
"The second type is signaling intent. As opposed to signaling support, signaling intent doesn’t actually do anything on a technical level. Rather, it's literally miners sending a message to the world, which has in the past, for example, been used to state a preference for a potential scaling solution. (While miners can also do this through letters or blog posts, coinbase signaling cannot possibly be faked, so it’s a bit more reliable.)"
@_date: 2018-12-15 14:10:45
It amazes me how the general opinion of this sub is that no knowledge, analysis, price history, experience, fundamentals, etc will help you to understand the value of Bitcoin and it's future value.  The data is there.  And just like times past when the time comes everyone will say, "all the signs were there.  We knew it was going to happen." Just like everyone has said after the drop from $20K, "It was obvious we knew it had to crash".  Don't guess.  Obtain knowledge and put value in the things you believe in.
@_date: 2017-06-07 02:15:05
I have an issue with this argument.  In theory I totally get it but in reality if a Trezor was compromised (especially multiple) it would destroy the company.  In addition at that time a vast majority of people would move funds off and emails, notifications, etc. Would be sent out in mass to move your money.  As far as I know noone has EVER lost funds when using a Trezor as designed.  EVER!  Am I wrong?

I think the answer is yes.  You should be able to sell your most expensive coins first.  Assuming the sell price is lower than purchase price it will be a loss on your taxes.  Of course consult an accountant for official advice.

It it's impossible to know.  You can only go off the history of btc and do research to draw a conclusion on what you think the value of bitcoin should be.  One thing is for sure - if btc is widely adopted the price vs the dollar will be MUCH higher.  Currently it is estimated only .5 percent of the US own or have owned bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-21 04:38:05
Now you are actually pointing out a valid "weakness" with Bitcoin - security.  Solvable but certainly a weakness right now.    Showing your private key publicly is not.
@_date: 2013-12-09 14:00:53
Those of us that have been involved for several years are holding all and buying on dips.  If we spend any we buy them back as soon as possible - preferably during a dip (at least that is what you should be doing).
The reason for this is because if you have been studying BTC for years you see what it really is.  These dips are repeats of the several that have already happened and we already know the aftermath of those.
It sure is fun to watch :)

What it does for most customers was not my point.  I was bringing up what it does for Bitcoin (as a currency) which would be significant. You are talking about what it does for the merchant which I agree is not much...but I never said it would do much for the merchant.  We are not disagreeing I don't think just talking about different things.

If the fee was just too small it will eventually drop out of backlog and be in original account.  Then you can send again with appropriate fee.

@_date: 2013-12-29 14:50:00
You are absolutely wrong.  The more merchants that accept Bitcoin the more value it brings to the rest of the people that hold Bitcoin.. This allows for greater utility.  Merchants accepting Bitcoin is huge regardless if they keep it or switch to fiat.  If you still do not see this truth imagine this - Amazon starts accepting Bitcoin or Target or Walmart... What would they do for Bitcoin? ?  It is obvious that it increases its value because it increases the functional uses in the world.  The companies themselves keeping btc or not is unimportant right now.
@_date: 2013-12-21 04:01:59
No, I think you are.  This shows the lack of understanding many people have.  Showing a private key is like handing someone cash - it is gone.  It is not a weakness but rather a designed feature.

If you were buying for the currency value then you would unlikely buy at the highest price ever.  Just pointing out if you bought then you were trying to make money meaning fiat not btc.  If you buy for the value of btc as currency then you really don't worry too much about price vs dollar.  You just care about getting as much btc as possible.

In most cases these purchases (Lambo) use a middle man like Bitpay or Coinbase and immediately receive the $ value for the purchase.  They never touch BTC.  Merchant doesn't give a shit what the value of BTC is vs the $.
@_date: 2013-12-29 17:03:55
Yeah I disagree.  Anyone on the fence or considering owning btc would be pushed over the edge knowing that they could easily spend them in everyday stores.  The protocol gives reasons to switch.  Merchants accepting gives utility beyond store of value.
