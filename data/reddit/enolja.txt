There are forms of governmwnt that lend themselves to particular ideals more than othera, without a doubt. A representative democracy lends itself to whatever its people want, or can be manipulated to want, which is why its so great
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:55:55
Isnt a democratic government the collective will of the peoole who vote its representatives into their posistions? So if YOU want to give money to the poor, shouldn't you want your government to give to the poor?
Or do you think that individuals are going to manage the diverse financial needs of the many poor people in the country?
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:58:25
I think we're actually in agreement - I agree that people can feel passionately about things and not want the government to be in control of providing those things. The reason we have a representative democracy is built around that; how passionate are you about a particular subject and will you vote based on that subject (Buying beer, for example). The people can let their collective will be represented by their elected officials, who in turn can vote on laws and let their constituents voices be heard.
A representative democracy is the most libertarian *form of government* a nation can have - it's just that you live in a country that isn't full of other libertarians, so the government itself at the moment doesn't hold your shared libertarian values. However, freedom to choose your elected officials who then represent those views in government is a libertarian ideal unto itself. 
This is where I get hung up with libertarians, because we live in a libertarian society *right now* but most people don't share libertarian ideals and viewpoints. The current system of government we have is the epitome of a libertarian government because people get to choose which parties are in control.
Now, weather or not you feel that the people are accurately represented is a different argument, and I do feel that we need a better system to choose our elected officials (Replacing first-pass-the-post with something better), so the people's will can be more accurately heard would be more ideal. Like I said though, that is a different argument.
Edit: if you want to argue the morality or value of government providing those services, that's one thing, I'm just pointing out that we get to exercise those values through voting - it's just people don't agree that government shouldn't provide welfare, most people think it should.

Your analogy is bad because buying a round at the bar is not analagous with providing necessities to life for a portion of the population. If you feel passionately about buying people beer though, so much so that you feel the need to vote for a governing official based on their shared desire to buy beer, then its obviously your choice, but I doubt many politicians have ran on such a platform. The opposite can't be said for welfare.

Bitcoin and others like it are inventions, and may have some kind of sociopolitical connotation that the author attempts to imbue into the technology, weather or not they're successful in that endeavor is a different topic.

The price of remittance is not one that bitcoin should concern itself with. Especially the back and forth between fiat currencies. Once value has been stored in bitcoin, the coin can be transferred for zero fees at that point it can be exchanged for zero fees for goods and services. 
Remember that the price of sending bitcoin to and from a place is always zero. Any fee that occurs is due to the innefficiencies of FIAT.

Scalability comes at a price, that is kind of a buzzword these days.

You cannot accurately predict the markets. If you could, you would take all of your available credit and assets,  and exchange everything for the investment vehicle. Instead people get lucky for a few months and delude themselves into thinking they somehow understand the market.

Outsmarting the market is not a game anyone can play. People who say differently are fooling themselves. Even the most famous investors have long track records of failures to predict the market. You can educate yourself and understand what is widely regarded as institutional and smart investing and you will do better for it. But you will never make accurate market predictions in the long term.
 The best thing you can do as a novice investor getting into a volatile asset like Bitcoin is to decide NOW if you believe in it and then dollar cost average an amount you're willing to part with completely and never stop. At least until you can predict the markets....

Because Dark Wallet uses Stealth Addresses and Coin Join to maintain anonymity. These concepts are not easy to explain and there aren't many people who fully understand them yet .Do your own research and decide for yourself if you think they provide a decent level of anonymity / security for your purpose.

Nothing about telnet is broken, it is simply not encrypted. Lots of technologies still make use of Telnet. 
Professional network administrators use telnet to this day. Source: I am a professional network administrator and used telnet today.

Everyone was posting this garbage two weeks ago. It's basically irrelevant now and doesn't really hold up any longer. 
I'm sure someone will modify the timeline to try and make it seem like it still matters.

A bank is basically the most insecure way to store your wealth. Not because they don't give it back to you when you ask for it, but becase people have a critical misunderstanding of what wealth is. 
When you give a bank 20 dollars in 2010 and they give you 20 dollars in 2014, you have lost a lot of money. That bank and used your money to generate interest and stolen it from you when they return the 20 dollars in the future. 
If people really understood the gravity and depth of interest they were losing each day/month/year they would realize that banks are really the most insecure place to store value and worth. 
If you think me storing bitcoins on my home computer is insecure and presents a security problem, you need to look at the big picture of banking and understand that is a global security problem.

Easy, by incorporating from a different place. Or by simply doing business regardless of the regulations. Like many companies before, and like many to come.

I'm not entirely certain on the technicalities. I believe it uses something called a stealth address.  You send someone your stealth address and their darkwallet generates a new wallet, the new wallet's private key is based on the original stealth address you sent them. The bitcoin is transferred into this new wallet, and within the nonce (unused data space?) of that transaction, your darkwallet will recognize it as one of it's very own while validating it and then will appear as one of your wallets? 
I don't get it but I've read the wikipedia a lot. Hopefully someone can clear me up.

You continually evade requests for evidence.

You sort of don't.
Has anyone explained decentralization to you? 
Edit: I don't mean to be so sarcastic here. But really, there isn't a reliable way that Bitcoin can be regulated. It simply cannot happen. Not because I don't want it to - but because it isn't feasible or possible.

"Legitimate business" is a ridiculous notion to begin with. 
Exchange simply exists, there is no legitimacy or not. The things you're talking about are social expressions that exist in the current state of the financial and political system. They're illusions.
Edit/example: How many legitimate music stores do you know of? Hrm.... I guess nobody has or is listening to music eh?

This is absolutely correct. Businesses will wisely leave NYS and go to greener pastures and NYS will deeply regret their decisions.
Do not let them speak to you from a position of power that does not exist. They do not get to determine regulations on Bitcoin, because they can't. Not because we don't want them to.

I thought he was the leader. I must have mis-read or mis-understood. It doesn't really matter though, a board member of the Bitcoin foundation should not be spending time working on an alt-coin, free time or not.

When the price of bitcoin is lower, it allows me to purchase more. I am always happy when the price is falling. I wish it were a dollar again.

I like when the price goes down because it allows me to purchase more Bitcoin.
Not every price fluctuation has a story. Maybe someone found out their daughters college doesn't accept bitcoin. Who fucking cares anyway, I get some more!

Maybe I'm just confused, could someone explain why I would purchase bitcoin on the "coinbase exchange" rather than simply purchasing bitcoin?
ie: All of the other bitcoin sellers have been calling themselves exchanges since the beginning, what is different here?

Your post describes exactly what I'm talking about.
You outline all the ways that art could be judged, and all of those ways are 100% subjective. Also the fact that different measures can be used for different people, from different backgrounds further proves my point that art is subjectively rated. 
I am not saying it does not take skill to create, or that it is value-less. I am saying that it's value is derived from the market, and from what people subjectively apply to it. 
*I am saying* that I could make this piece of art myself for around ~$25, and I would be more intersted in doing that, than paying more than 50x that for someone else to do it for me.

How is it a scam coin? Let me guess, it isnt bitcoin and the current price isn't 1750 USD right? 
Vert is open source, commited devs, no premining, no 'initial coin offering', ASIC resistant algorithm, active community. What else do you want? Should they call it bitcoin?

I'm working on the Wheel of Time series right now, just finished the Gunslinger by stepehen King before that, and also trying to get through Terry Pratchett books as well, most recently read Guards! Guards!
A lot of my friends read as well, many of them are in book clubs with *other people that read*. 
I really don't think you have any idea what you're talking about, people still read books, billions of people in fact.

Could only watch this for 10 seconds before turning it off. Central banking has provided insane benefits to consumers and economies throughout our history. Yes it has corruption yes there are problems, but being able to get a mortgage is a powerful thing.

I don't exactly agree with him, but bitcoin is just an invest vehicle not something you thank like a friend, you made a good investment, good job
@_date: 2017-05-13 20:08:27
My point still stands.  the reason it has very little load is because it's completely unattractive to massive mining companies which is a very good thing. It has an Asic resistant algorithm which is a big selling point for vertcoin
@_date: 2017-05-14 18:01:42
Yes of course you can, but we don't yet. Bitcoin distributed lending already exists, but it's still to volatile to be implemented for something like a mortgage. 
I like bitcoin, and other alt-coins, but we can't just make a blanket statement that all centralization and banks are evil, they empower everyday people to make purchases at low interest rates with money they don't have, it's extremely important to society. 
And to that point, not *everything* needs to be decentralized.
