To be honnest this doesnt say Much about tradeing just “ buy Low sell “ High witch is kinda a No brainer. If You want to Trade and want to make profit that is not only based On luck. Then You have to read everything there is On marked about The Stock You Wanna buy. Fx Whitepapers reports and by that You Will build know how about The marked and being able to know if stuff is under valued. Fx H n M is insanely under valued . “ Daytrading is something normal ppl should Never do Before You are debt free and have like 100.000 of freecash to make it worth doing. And buying becaus a news paper tells You too is = buying overvalued stocks
