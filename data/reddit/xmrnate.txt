I've been waiting on Tier 3 since the beginning of December. 
Escalated ticket, was asked to resubmit pics, promptly did so, and have heard nothing since. 
I fucked up and didn't do enough research on this place, the info on their website is complete bullshit and I took it at face value. Tried to cash out a significant portion of my cryptos that I've collected over the past few years, now my money is stuck and support ignores my messages. 
Proceed with extreme caution.

That's correct. 
Since realizing that  they have no intention of helping me get verified, I've been converting back to crypto and withdrawing small amounts daily. The limits are low though, and it will take me another 2 months at least to get the funds out.

This seems almost backwards to me. Not a lot of unregulated markets to observe today, but lots of heavily regulated markets and there seems to be a very strong correlation between how heavily regulated a market is and how heavily monopolized/oligopolized that market is.

That's good to hear, thanks. Hopefully they'll continue making progress

I've been waiting a month for Tier 3. 
When support finally contacted me, they asked me to resubmit my docs, which I promptly did. That was 4 days ago, no response from support, no confirmation that the docs were received, no nothing. 
It was especially fishy that right after support finally emailed me asking me to reload my docs, the site just so happened to throw up a new "permission denied" error if I tried to upload or delete anything. I ended up having to send the docs to him as an email attachment. Most concerning though, is the fact that this service rep most likely sabotaged my account deliberately so that I wouldn't be able to load or delete anything. I 100% believe that to b the case, I'd been dicking around with this site for a month every single day and never got this "permission denied" message until after this clown emailed me pretending he was gonna help. 
These lowlifes are refusing to help me and won't even acknowledge me at all anymore. Not pocket change, this is almost 100k we're talking about here.  I've been patient and trying to give them benefit of the doubt but they just keep fucking lying, stalling,and making excuses like a crackhead that thinks he's slick. 
If you're trying to deposit though, in typical ponzi fashion you'll probably get verified soon no problem.

Hello there, I've been waiting 3 weeks for Tier 3 verification. Got escalated, sent in new round of docs to CS rep as directed, and have been ignored for the past 3 days. No response, will not confirm receipt of docs, and obviously hasn't approved the Tier 3. 
In the time it took to send me the worthless emails that ignored the key points of the issue at hand, support could have looked at the docs I submitted and verified that I'm who I say I am, quite easily. 
I would've posted this on the kraken or krakensupport sub but you guys are deleting all comments. The support rep that was working on my case has disappeared without assisting me at all. So I'm forced to comment on someone else's thread because its the only chance I have. 
I want my money ,I'm tired of the endless lies and deception.

Any new developments with your withdrawal?

PokerStars ended up being the only legit US-facing room after all the dust settled. The rest were ponzis to various degrees, Full Tilt being the worst. 
Similar to crypto, they operated in grey area legally and had problems with banking, ended up getting robbed and paying out the ass for shady payment processors. Feds were seizing millions at a time when they busted the processors. This is allegedly how they started losing reserves, along with pulling multiple millions for themselves as owners (Full Tilt Pros)
But yes, a competent operation could've kept 100% of reserves and still made a killing like Stars. Full Tilt was owned by degenerate gamblers with no business experience

Been waiting over 2 weeks myself.
Support is completely non-existent. I have 45k stuck on this shithole exchange and can't get any answers.  
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:05:50
This is amazing. I had no idea this was possible. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:29:21
Incredible. The support rep assigned to my case just vanished without assisting me at all. That was a week ago, no one else has responded either.

I'd wager that it's definitely happening to some degree, we just don't know the extent. Lots of suspected wash trading bots on all exchanges. They get offered zero-fee trades by exchanges for the liquidity they provide, so it costs nothing for them to paint the tape.  
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:49:04
There are still exchanges offering no fee trades to high volume accounts. I want to say maybe kraken is that way, after reaching a couple million in trades the fees are reduced to nothing on all future trades. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:36:31


Lol, I should put this on a poster and hang it on my engineer's wall. 
So perfect :)
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:32:26
No, it's crypto only I believe. So you'd have to buy something elsewhere and transfer coins there.

Tier 2. Limit is 5k daily, 50k monthly for crypto withdrawals. Tier 1 qualifies for no withdrawals at all, of either crypto or fiat. 
I've never had issues withdrawing from Coinbase and GDAX (same company, GDAX is the exchange). But they only offer a few coins. 
Gemini, Bittrex, I'd recommend if you want more exotic coins. Then you can trade them and convert them if you needed to withdraw on another exchange, or just withdraw directly. Bitstamp is also reliable and reputable. 
If you're gonna put a significant investment into this, I'd register on all the exchanges just to spread the risk around and avoid getting your goose cooked if one goes belly up. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:40:57
Maybe for the lowest tiers, with little or no ability to withdraw. 
Try getting Tier 3 verified.

You probably went over your daily limit for withdraws, which is easy to do because they don't base the value of a withdrawal on the price you paid for the coins, or the current market price. They seemingly just pull some number out of their ass and they don't explain how they arrive at this figure anywhere on the site. I believe it's a deliberate tactic to limit outflows from their site. 
I'm in a similar boat, they refuse to verify my account so I'm now stuck trying to get my crypto off the site in tiny daily portions. I have only USD in my account, I just made an order for $4990 LTC and then tried to withdraw it (it was like 19 ltc). They only let me withdraw 17 coins, and I had to sell the remainder because I'm at the daily max limit for withdraws. They are holding my money hostage and fucking me over in fees as I try to exit this nightmare. At this rate, they will be holding all my money for at least 8 weeks. This is the most dishonest, disgusting organization I've ever dealt with. They have stolen my money, or at least forced me to loan them 95k for two months interest free (remains to be seen if I'll get it all back). I've been physically sick for the past several weeks as I try to come to terms with the fact that I've been jacked for almost 100k. This is not a trustworthy exchange, every aspect of my dealings here have been shady as hell. No help from support, not even a automated email, just nothing. 
This is not an honest business that's just been so successful that they can't keep up. Their behavior has been completely shady and indistinguishable from that of a failing, criminal ponzi scheme seeking to defraud as many people as possible. Start preparing yourself for the possibility that your money is gone. i've been anguishing over this for about a month now with no signs of progress being made or help from support.

Deposits are safe. Just don't try to withdraw anything and you won't have any problems, OP.
Kraken won't approve my Tier 3 verification, been waiting over a month. Got escalated, support rep finally responds. I answer back with new docs attached as requested, rep never responds and disappears for the past 5-6 days after providing no help. Can't get my money off this site. 
Be aware of the tiny withdrawal limits, OP. Deposits are unlimited but withdrawals are limited to 5k until they decide to verify you. If you go one cent over the 5k limit your account is locked, but  they never tell you what price they're using to calculate this number. Hint: it's not the price you paid, or the current market price.
