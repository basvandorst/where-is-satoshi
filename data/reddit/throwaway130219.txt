Sadly, unlike bitcoin; commodities differ from place to place due to the amount they are grown/found in any specific place. But, bitcoin is everywhere.

That precisely my point - you can't think of bitcoin like gold or computers or cars. Each one of them isn't global. Tesla doesn't even sell in my country. You can't buy Tesla in my country.  
Bitcoin is global. Think of the entire world as a single country.

Yeah, I agree with you. My point was to hypothetically view entire world as a single nation. For instance, imagine your peer - one who is equal to you in age/experience etc but sits in a different cabin. He earns 10x the amount you earn. Now that different cabin is a different country having a strong currency. But both of you work under the same roof. Right? You wouldn't feel happy knowing the guy in the same premises but in a different cabin earns 10x for the same amount and type of work you do.  
I tried to visualize the same thing with bitcoin - we all have this opportunity to buy: but the amount is greatly skewed because of the currency in which we live. Though my bitcoin being exactly the same as yours.

"Lack the will to work"? So, in one post you recognized my character. Wow! You should be a magician maybe. The point with bitcoin is slightly different since it's global - without boundaries. Think of the entire world as one single country.

Apologies, if the post got into a totally wrong direction. I was just thinking along these lines to be frank and wanted to know if this is even a problem with Bitcoin?

The point here is not about donation.
The point here is giving "the poorer" people an equal opportunity so that they don't even require donations. Donations are always welcome anytime to anyone irrespective of rich/poor. That's not the point I was trying to make in this post.

I picked Tesla purposely because like Bitcoin it is *a small-scale, new entrant to the market, whose production &amp; distribution are still in an embryonic stage.*
But unlike Tesla, you can still buy Bitcoin because it's available globally. Which is why I stated that comparing these things to Bitcoin isn't wise.
