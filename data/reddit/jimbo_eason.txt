wow are you really that ignorant?  do you have any idea what you own?  did someone tell you to buy BTC way back when and you never bothered to do even the slightest homework?  just take your $7000 in new found wealth and make a down payment on a Lambo...

You're right, stay away from BitCoin.  It's bad.  Your friends will be rich one day and you'll still be working in a cubicle...
But you'll be right...it's bad.  run the opposite way.

yeah it's pretty cool.  I keep it open all the time as it updates constantly.  I hope the math is correct...pretty complicated formula but it is fun to watch...makes you never want to sell a Bitcoin!

Very nice article and open letter to Jamie.  I do hope you understand one thing though...Jamie knows all the great info you put in your letter.  He simply wanted BTC to crash so he JPM could buy more...
He is the fraud for doing what he did...probably broke some laws, but what else is new.  The banksters are very very worried.  They know something is up and now want in...they missed BTC for the past 8 years and want in on the cheap...that's it in a nutshell.

no worries about market cap going to sh!tcoins right now...it's great that its happening because it will all flow back to BTC/ETH is weeks/months...
people are entering the cryptocurrency space at a record pace...trying out the "pennystock/sh!tcoins" because of low price, but will eventually move 80% to BTC/ETH.
