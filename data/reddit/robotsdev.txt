But I thought that ANY malleability fix would remove the "covert" part of covert ASIC boost anyways? not just because it's segwit, but because the bug is in the malleability problem itself.

But coinbase complains that fees are too high, while being partly responsible for that high price (as of today, if they truly could save all that blockspace)
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:13:31
I'd say this is still pretty high, but it's certainly the lowest it's been for a while.  
With more segwit adoption we can make those fees even lower.

@_date: 2018-01-30 05:21:40
To me this is just the best possible proof that we didn't need to increase the block size limit.  
Increasing it actually brings problems of decentralization (not because of hard disk space, but because you have to transmit and process twice as many transactions).  
Maybe in the future, but I'm glad we didn't go ahead with yet another hard fork.

I hope it's true, but to me it just looks like the transactions with low fees are being dropped from the mempool because they didn't get confirmed in a certain period of time.

You can try just obfuscating your seed words.  Change the order to something only you know.
Write 48 words and use only the odd ones, and half way thru, the even ones (there is a list of words, so use those, obviously, not just made up words).
Or any other unique idea you can find to obfuscate the words. Just remember that words come from a list of 1024, and if those words are all together, someone can find them and know what they are, and in the right order, they will get your keys.  
Then think of a very good hiding place too.

The point is that big exchanges haven't implemented it, and they could. The GUI is not an issue for an exchange.  
That is the point of this thread.
Another matter is that yes, the core wallet doesn't have a UI for segwit yet, and that's something we would all like to see implemented. And it's a fact that nobody is denying. They are working on it so that it's done safely for all the regular users too.  
In the end the issue is that transactions are expensive. And coinbase and other exchanges are not helping, making excuses about them needing security, but then had no trouble trying to implement untested and buggy segwit2X code.

The average bytes per transaction is already lowered if you use segwit. 
Lightning Network will take many transactions off-chain (while still being completely trustless), reducing the amount of transactions on-chain, so fees will be cheaper in the main chain too.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:04:09
It basically says that to make 7 billion x 2 transactions per day, we would need either 24 GB blocks (without LN), or 133 MB blocks (with LN, this is an estimate though).
Seems right to me, and seems to me that just increasing block size is not a solution. LN is the solution.
The 133 MB blocks are needed IF we want 14 billion transactions a day.
I don't know why people are saying that we need a block size increase, what we need is LN as soon as possible.

Of course the scaling debate is important, nobody is thinking bitcoin should always stay like this forever.  
Core wanted to implement segwit for years, but miners didn't agree, so they "forced" it with UASF. Now we have segwit, and we could basically do twice as many transactions if everyone was using segwit.  
LN will come, and then we can potentially have thousands of transactions per second.  
There are problems that come from increasing the block size.  
2X what it is now is not a big problem, we didn't change it in BTC because it was rushed and untested.  
And also because that's not the final answer to achieving thousands of transactions per second.
a 2X increase would allow for less than 30 transactions per second, and to allow for 1000s per second on chain, it would require a massive amount of space, and most importantly, many small miners wouldn't be able to even handle all that transaction volume.  
It's just not feasable.  
What we need is a real scaling solution, and this is where doing transactions off-chain comes up.  
As you point out, many people say that it's just fine as a store of value even if fees are expensive, but I think that's a minority. Most people think that FIRST, it has to be a store of value, 100% decentralized, and then it can solve the other problems.  
BCH is not as decentralized, we had a miner taking like 60% of the power when it wasn't profitable to mine it. We know the main actors ruling BCH and we know that if they wanted, they could just hard fork it to whatever they want. I don't want BTC to become another ETH.  
Increasing the blockchain size would help now, sure, but so would major players switching to segwit.  
Some of those major players have been complaining that we need to lower fees, but then they're not using segwit. They didn't want lower fees, they wanted to take control away from core.

So then the other guy says: best time was 20 years ago (enough for the tree to grow and cast a cool shadow)  
I agree with the part that the second best time was a second later, but the saying is probably about how the second best time (AVAILABLE TO US NOW) is now

@_date: 2017-12-12 13:36:40
Maybe not the most efficient, but you can do this:  
1. Download a new wallet software, install it (on your phone or whatever)  
2. Try to "Sweep" the bitcoin from that private key. 
3. Pray
Here is an example: 
Seed words are the key to generating infinite private keys. If you only have one private key, you might not have all the funds that were available in that wallet. When you do transactions, funds are usually sent to another address (called change address), but the money might still be there.
Good luck!

Once you close the channel, the aggregate of all those transactions ends up as one transaction in the blockchain.   
And the transactions stored in that LN channel can be discarded.  
It doesn't compress 1000 transactions, it removes them.

As far as I know, you can send them your bitcoins from a segwit address and you would get smaller transaction fees (if calculated properly). When receiving FROM the exchanges, since their addresses are not segwit, then sadly you'd pay a bigger fee.
But the actual point is that if everyone was using it (specially the big exchanges), then the blocks would be used much more effectively.  
Sadly most wallets still don't handle segwit addresses in their UI, but some do.

Since you know so little about bitcoin (as you said), you might want to learn just a little bit more and not sell your whole position.   
I remember a thread just like a month ago of a guy selling at 10,000 because that was the top. He could have had almost twice as much by now.  
I know it's risky, but in a way it's a safe bet. Limit supply of bitcoins, and the supply decreases every few years. In 2020 there will be another halvening, having a bit of BTC then "might" help you pay some more years of rent.

OK, it seems that you can't find it because there doesn't seem to be a list of portuguese seed words for BTC?
Are you portuguese/brazilian? if not, maybe you meant spanish words?
At any rate, here are the keywords used for seed words.  
[  
They work the same in all languages, basically if you can input the words in english, you can just look up the word from your language into english (not the meaning of the word, but the position in the word list).   
For example in Spanish I have the word ábaco, it's the first word on the lsit so I would go to the english list and see the first word, abandon, and that's the word you can input in your wallet recovery.

I never spent too much on bitcoin, but in the end it ended up being a big chunk of my savings.  
Now that the price has come up this fast, I'm also a bit scared. I started to hold bitcoin because I wanted to be an early adopter. Not because it would go up 1000x, but because I have lived in foreign countries and I'd love to have all my money outside of a bank, without borders, but still secure.  
But you know the saying: "don't invest more than you're willing to lose". I didn't invest much, but now it's worth more than I'd like to lose.  
The thing is, I believe that bitcoin will go up, or at least it won't come down from this point by too much, or for too long.  
If it doesn't, if bitcoin goes down to nearly $0, unless there is something really wrong with bitcoin (highly unlikely), I'd probably buy more, just to be ready for when I can use bitcoin every day.
@_date: 2018-08-09 15:35:36
Trying to do that made me lost money. Now I only HODL.
Also bitcoin price won't just go up slowly, it will be a sudden jump and if you blink you will have to buy half of the bitcoin you had originally.
Big whales are manipulating the market so that nervous investors that try to play the market will lose. I'm not a professional trader, other people are. I'm trading against those people, so I will obviously, in the long term, lose. 
This is why I HODL.

A Hard fork doesn't necessarily mean creating 2 blockchains. BCH survived because they implemented a difficulty change. If they hadn't done that \(which is what would probably happen if there is consensus\), then the hardfork would have died almost immediately, with not enough hashrate to reach the 2000 blocks necessary for another difficulty adjustment \(which wouldn't have been enough anyways\). Blocks would take hours or even days if it's not profitable for miners.  
But even if you don't create another permanent chain, a hardfork is still undesirable because it can create incompatibilities with older clients

By then, people might agree to keep giving rewards.  
The thing is, by 2140, if BTC is the world currency, this means 1 bitcoin is worth a lot, and we're using sub-satoshi.  
The reason the rewards stop in 2140 is because the reward is 1 satoshi and can't be subdivided any more. But by then maybe we have agreed to fork into a bitcoin with a sub-satoshi unity, and then maybe we will just fork again to allow the continuation to mining, and still just halve the reward that miners get.

Miners receive bitcoin for securing the network. Currently every 10 mintues (average) one miner gets 12.5 BTC.
After the halvening, they will receive only 6.25 BTC every 10 minutes.

I think you're mistaken about the meaning of "inflation".  We're not talking about price volatility. 
It has nothing to do with price, 0 to do with price, absolutely unrelated.  
Inflation is about the supply of a certain currency.
Governments print money constantly, that's inflation.  And sometimes there is hyperinflation, when the governments just print money like crazy, devaluing the currency to nothing, because there is more of it.
The bitcoin protocol dictates that every block 12.5 BTC are created \(every 10 minutes\) Since there are already 17 million BTC created already, this year's rate is around 4&amp; inflation. After 2020 the rate will be less than 2&amp;

The idea of HODL has been corrupted. Originally it was a guy who lost a lot of bitcoin by daytrading it.  
The point of HODL is to not get manipulated by the market, and by the whales. These whales are good at this, they are good at taking money away from the hands of inexperienced daytraders. You might get lucky once or twice, or 10 times, but in the end, statistically, you will likely lose your bitcoin.   
You will end up risking too much and panic selling, or you might miss a huge spike like the ones last year where it never went back down to $3k, and then you buy at $10k.  
In the end the idea is that if you HODL your bitcoin, you won't end up with less bitcoin. If you play with them, if you think you can time the market, then you will give your bitcoin to people who do this as a full time job and know what they're doing.

\&gt; Is this a kind-of 'work around' of an inherent flaw of the Bitcoin network? 
It's not a flaw of bitcoin though, it's more like a tradeoff. You can have security, decentralization, or speed, but not all of them together. Bitcoin gives up speed for decentralization.
LN is not a blockchain, so it doesn't have to chose between the same tradeoffs. Bitcoin transactions are just signatures made with privatekeys that prove that X wallet sent money to Y wallet. The idea basically is that we don't need to tell everyone about our transactions, specially if we make a bunch of them. We just add up the result later and settle it in the blockchain, but blockchain doesn't need to know that we transacted 400 times, if there is one result at the end. It was all just added up.
And then the other genius part is the network part. If I have a channel with multiple people, I can connect them. X gives me money to pass along to Y, and it's safe and secure because I don't know the source or the final target of that money.
Liquidity is low at the moment, as it should be. There are still a few things to fix with the LN. Watchtowers for example will make people feel more secure putting money in the LN network.

- How will users find my node?  
- How will they decide to use my node or not?  
- If I'm the only node in my area, are my chances of being used higher?  
- How will fees actually be calculated?  
- If nodes set their own fees, will it be a race to the bottom (fee-wise) for competing nodes?

So to make this clear, for LN servers to get some use, they will have to advertise somewhere else, and hope that the users add them to their wallets somehow?  
No hope for an unknown guy setting up a LN server?   
I guess at least I can create a LN server and use it myself.  
So basically "anyone can be a LN server" is sort of like "anyone can be a big youtuber", or "anyone can be a famous soccer player".  
But not in the sense that you just fire up the server and just help the network in the same way you would start a regular full node.

Consensus.  
Unless there is a really good reason for it, most people won't agree, and if there is a fork, it won't have consensus and it won't be bitcoin, it will be something else.

1. Use a wallet that let's you set the fees by yourself.  
2. Go here:  .  
3. Understand it (right now, every transaction with 5 satoshi per byte goes through for sure in the next block).    
I don't know if you can set your own fees in mycelium though.
@_date: 2018-06-06 09:07:31
You're right.  
And also BCH with 32mb blocks could achieve a higher transaction capacity. But BTC can achieve the same capacity with smaller blocks, which is just more efficient and I don't understand how someone can be against that.  
Blocks will have to increase one day, but as we can see, it wasn't necessary to increase them at the time of the fork, since we've had an almost empty pool after the December craze.
So in the future, if BTC has 32mb blocks, it will be able to do a lot more transactions than BCH at 32mb blocks. Specially because bigger blocks will also help with off-chain transactions. 
And that's how you truly scale.
Oh BTW, I'm not sure about the numbers in your calculations, I suck at math. So someone else would have to confirm those numbers. But your point is still correct.

If your wallet is still syncing, you won't see the transaction yet.  
If a blockchain explorer says that your address has bitcoin, then you probably have bitcoin.  
You have to be a but more specific with your problem.
@_date: 2018-06-15 10:09:45
1- You can be lucky and have an almost instant confirmation, and by that I mean an actual confirmation. If you send your transaction right before a block is found, and the miner decides to include it in the block.  It takes on average 10 minutes, but not 10 minutes since you sent your transaction, 10 minutes since the last block. You could send your transaction at minute 9:30 and get it in the next block.  You will also see your transaction in block explorers before this happens. The transaction is in the mempool waiting to be added by a miner. Depending on the fee, they will add it in the next block or not.  
2- Nodes can include false transactions. But then if they're not valid, other nodes will ignore it and not distribute it. The miner would lose the mining reward, and that blockchain would be forgotten.
Miners can't add a transaction from YOUR address. So nobody can even try to do that. Miners just get transactions, validate them, and then put them in the block. If a transaction is not valid, they won't include it in the block. (or else they lose a lot of potential income). Nobody votes on the validity. It's either valid or invalid. If a transaction is seeing as valid by some nodes, then it will fork, and die.
Nodes validate transactions, just because it's in the blockchain doesn't mean that the nodes will accept it. My full node will validate all the transactions in the block, and not accept them if they're not valid.
3- It would take in the order of several times the age of the universe for there to be 2 equal keys if they are generated truly randomly. You actually don't confirm that nobody has that key when you generate a new address. Even if you're online. And if you do, then you're the luckiest son of a bitch ever. It's just not going to happen.

Others already mentioned that LN can already handle sub\-satoshi transactions. But bitcoin can be made to do that too with a hard fork in the future.

Mining never becomes too expensive.   
If it does (temporarily), then miners that are not profiting stop mining. Then the difficulty lowers, then it's easier to mine.  
There is always someone there mining because it's profitable for them because they have free electricity, or very cheap.

First of all, these are transfers done I aide the exchange. No btc transaction is necessary when that happens. The exchange internally just changes how mug btc an account gas.

Average means nothing, median means nothing. The important value is "minimum fee in satoshi/byte to be included in the next block".
Which is between 1 and 2 for BTC right now.  
And then you have to use the dollar value for those, if you want to say that BTC transactions are cheaper than BCH transactions. AND THEN, you have to check the size of the transaction, which uses less bytes using segwit. Specially Bech32, which can be like half the amount of bytes.

The store of value argument started (I think) when the BCH camp started to say that bitcoin is not a currency because it costs $40 to transact.  
And sure that's a debatable point, but the problem is that the BCH camp wants to increase the blocksize, but they don't know, or don't want to understand, that a bigger block size is risky for several reasons.  
So if we had all gone the BCH way, we'd now have less security, which means less Store of value.  
If you sacrifice Store of Value you're not getting a good currency, no matter how fast it is.  
Sorry if I'm kind of rambling.

I view every little bit in BTC as its current value x100 in some years.
So something that seems to be $4 now, I think about it as $400.   
If BTC goes 10x (like it did since last year), then those $200 are $2,000.  
Unless you got already like 100 BTC, $200 in BTC is still a good investment now.

It's not supposed to mean buying at 3x value, it's supposed to mean, for example:  
There is 100 BTC in the buy orders in total, but the value traded was 3x that (I don't have data on this, just an example)  
This means that those coins were traded multiple times.  
It's really easy to do if you want with a low volume coin. And with the amount of money these people have, it's easy to do even with a big volume coin, at least temporarily.

They made me take a selfie with my ID and a paper that said Bittrex on it (or something similar).  
The problem is that I don't look like my own ID card because I lost a lot of weight, but they accepted it.  
They also wanted more data like maybe transactions I had made in the past recently, to make sure it was me. 
It also took about a week to get the first e-mail, then a bit more to actually get them to review it.  
They should have more people working on this!

There is also the case where BTC is being used in places where fiat currency has gone to hell. 
Bitcoin is VERY divisible. Gold is sort of divisible but not to the same degree.
So there is a case where the demand is not just as speculation, but as a way to save your money from terrible currencies in your country.  
I'm not saying this should be a reason for you to hold it, I mean that people give it value, so you can hold it too because people give it some value.

You can't directly trade with it because it's not on an exchange, but you can send and receive transactions easily.  
If you want to day-trade, then keep them in the exchange but know that you don't own your bitcoins, somebody else does. And many exchanges have been hacked or simply took all the money.  
If you don't need to day-trade, and you have a good amount of coins, a hardware wallet is the safest way to store them.  
The 2 most popular ones are trezor and ledger nano.

The altcoin has a hard fork coming very soon, which will change their broken difficulty adjustment algorithm (well, some say it's not broken, but then why change it!)  
This will mean that the changes in difficulty will be more smooth (once per block apparently?) so then probably x% of miners will mine BTC, and 100-x% will mine the alt, then difficulty should remain around the same for both coins all the time.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:29:45
But get the private keys from your trezor address now, obviously
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:19:57
It takes a little bit for miners to do the actual change to mine BTC, and then they have to mine the blocks.  
It (should) take around 10 minutes per block, so you still need to wait a few more hours for a considerable amount of transactions gets cleared. But now the amount of unconfirmed transactions should decrease, instead of increase.

Just make sure that your coins are in that exact address. Remember that when you send bitcoin, it will leave that address and go to the destination and to anew address.
A friend of mine lost several bitcoins (many years ago) because he stored his private key,then kept paying with bitcoin and assumed only the amount paid left that address.

I will spell it out for you:
1. Own the patent for a miner that exploits a bug in PoW solved by Segwit
2. Need to pump my own coin so that more miners mine it, and stop mining my rival coin
3. Go to korean exchange with 0% fees
And now pay attention to this part:
4. Put buy wall at highest buy price
(So people buying will buy mine)
5. Put sell wall at lowest sell price
6. Buy my own sell wall
7. Price just increased
8. Repeat ad infinitum because 0% fees.
Korean exchanges are not just 50% of the volume, they were most of the volume at the start, and then price went up so people start buying in other exchanges too.  
All you need to do to manipulate prices in crypto is enough coins and hopefully 0% fees.
But if you find this hard to believe it's ok. I'm just trying to help you understand how you're being manipulated with the price pump.

Still in development, but later you will be able to just fill a LN channel from a LN channel, without doing it on-chain.  
Not to mention that even right now, you only "need" one channel per person who joins the LN. Then those channels communicate through other channels. Opened LN channels don't have too much to do with amount of transactions, but with amount of people and wallets.  
I could have a channel with my boss so he can pay me, but it's not necessary.  
Again, I know this is still under development, but the potential for the future is there.

The point of bitcoin is that it's a public ledger, so that nobody can just go and change it, because everyone has their own copy and can know if you are trying to give them a coin you don't own, or a coin you already spent.  
Here you can see a bunch of stats about bitcoin
  
if you type your public address there, it will tell you where the bitcoin came, or where it went to. It's just addresses though, so unless you know who owns which address, you won't know who actually has the coins.

This makes no sense.  
Even if your computer is in the physical hands of a hacker, they can't steal anything if you don't sign the transaction with your trezor, which means you have to see it in the trezor screen and accept it with the physical trezor button.  
So either someone did that, or your trezor was compromised from the start and had a hacked firmware. Did you install the firmware on first use?
Also, you don't need to plugin your trezor to check your balance, it's a public ledger, you can just use a multitude of websites or apps to check the balance.

If you're talking about BCH, it's farther from Bitcoin's original idea as it can be.   
Not because of block size, but because of the difficulty adjustment change.
The idea with the difficulty adjustment would be that forks without the consensus would die. And die quickly. BCH didn't die because it cheated the difficulty algorithm. With the regular BTC algorithm it would have died almost immediately.

Even though this is true, and good, people are thinking that it costs $5 to send a bitcoin transaction. This is just **false**.  
The average is due to people setting high transaction fees, or due to big transactions (effectively more than 1 transaction disguised as 1 transaction).   
With the average of 250 bytes per transaction (and less for segwit ones), at 2 sat/byte (currently some 1 sat/byte transactions are going thru), you're paying 250 x 2 satoshis, then your transaction is less than 4 cents.  
Someone correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2018-11-27 07:53:31
When some miners stop mining, difficulty of mining goes down, so mining costs go down.
And like you said, even your number is an average. Many people have subsidized electricity costs, or they have deals with electricity companies.  
In china for example, they are preparing for a new big city somewhere, so they build a dam and all that, and the electricity produced is too much for the current city, so basically they have extra power.  
Bitcoin mining looks for those places where electricity is cheapest and it's a left-over, so there is always people who can mine even if the value of bitcoin went to almost 0.

Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and the lows pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino bucks sure no problem bro.  Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT'S GOING DOWN I'M GONNA SELL he he he and then they're like OH GOD MY ASSHOLE when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE DOING buy back in but you know what?  I'm not part of that group.  When the traders buy back in I'm already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU'RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~!  Those taunt threads saying "OHH YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD" YEAH NO SHIT.  NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD.  I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU.

@_date: 2018-02-13 14:46:00
Let's do some math.  
average transaction size is around 250 bytes.  
let's do 3 satoshis per byte, even though 2 satoshis per byte have also been clearing lately.  
3 x 250 = 750. so 750 satoshi for the whole transaction, with an average transaction size.  
1 satoshi = $0.0000864959  
750 satoshi = $0.0648858000
So yeah, it's not 3 cents, it's 6 cents. With segwith your transaction size or a 1 input 1 output transaction is 134 bytes. Which would be a total of $0.03475.  
And if you wait a few blocks and set it to 2 satoshis per byte, then it will be even less.
So fees are less than $0.1, if you don't overpay, and don't make a transaction with too many inputs or outputs.  
Oh, and using bech32 addresses you can reduce the size even further.
@_date: 2018-03-01 00:32:39
Bitcoin adoption is still tiny.  
And even if this gets the price higher than now, the current price might already account for this type of stuff.

I believe it will go higher, much higher, but it needs time.

You're missing all of it.  
Blocks are supposed to be mined every 10 minutes. Based on the hashrate of the network (based on how much mining the miners are mining), the difficulty to find a block increases or decreases. This change happens every 2016 blocks, but I'll go back to it later.  
After 10 minutes, whoever found the solution to the very difficult problem, will be rewarded 12.5 bitcoin. This doesn't change, except for a thing called "the halvening", every 4 years or so, the block reward halves. It started as 50 BTC, then 25 BTC, now it's at 12.5 BTC (every 10 minutes).  
Now about the hashrate. The difficulty is calculated every 2016 blocks (or something like that, like a week or whatever), and then all the miners look for the solution, one finds it every 10 minutes. This is just an average, sometimes a block could take 1 hour, sometimes 3 blocks can be mined within 2 minutes.  
Now let's assume that HALF the miners suddenly stopped mining.  
Well, since the difficulty is adjusted every X blocks, we still have to find those blocks, and it will take twice as long to reach the 2016 blocks. But it will be reached. Then the difficulty will be adjusted DOWN by a lot, and then it will be profitable for more miners to mine it. 
But why didn't half of the miners stop mining if it wasn't profitable?  
Well, like I mentioned before in another post, electricity is not valued the same everywhere, so some miners will always mine no matter what.  
In your last paragraph, yes, it will take the same machine still 3 days to mine it (until difficulty adjusts). But the total bitcoins mined till date have no relation with difficulty, except about how close we are to the next difficulty adjustment.

Exactly this. If you can read a graph and are able to interpret this, you can see that transactions with 2 sat/byte are clearing every few blocks, but transactions below 10 sat/byte are always being sent on the next block. If you're a bit patient you can get it confirmed within 3-6 blocks for 2 sat/byte, and if you're very patient you can get them confirmed with 1 sat/byte in a few hours.  
This is not December where fees were 500 sat/byte anymore.  And if you use segwit, you'd also be saving about half the transaction size (so less bytes, which means less satoshis)  
Bitcoin has a scalability issue, but this issue is not really present at today's scale.

Blocks are mined on average every 10 minutes anyways. Transactions are faster if they do batching than if they don't, since they were a big part of the problem with long transaction times before anyways.

Comparing it to one country's GDP doesn't seem right though, it's a global currency, and the major buyers are (were) china, japan, korea, etc. We might see great adoption starting in countries with monetary problems like venezuela or countries where something similar starts to happen. If a lot of those countries' rich people start storing their money as BTC, price can easily go up by a lot. And marketcap means nothing really. 4 million BTC are believed to be lost forever for example.
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:44:02
But it can be less than $1.
$5 is average because so many people are still overpaying. You can put your transaction on the next block for 2 satoshi/byte right now.
Average means nothing. The only relevant data is "minimum fee to be included in the next block". Beyond that price everything is just people overpaying.

I wouldn't mind a discussion (again) about how to secure your bitcoin.  
First thing is to never tell people you have ANY bitcoin, even if it's just 0.1 BTC, people may think you're one of those bitcoin rich people.  
I lost mine by being irresponsible (trying to get some of those bitcoin forks and I didn't follow all precautions), but even if not true, it's still a good thing to say to people who know you have bitcoin.  
You can also say that you sold them already or something.  
Another secure way is to have multiple wallets, trezor (and ledger too I assume) let you have different wallets in the same device, basically no way to know some of the BTC even exists until you put your keyword.  
Be careful about how you keep your bitcoin, there are many ways to lose them. Being your own bank means you are completely your own bank and can't go talk to someone about your lost bitcoin.

Don't forget about change addresses. Every time you send coins, some coins (may) end up in a change address. That's why the whole wallet is important, not just one private key.  
Also just to make sure, you mean private keys, and not your password that you use to encrypt the wallet right?  
The password is useless without the private keys or the wallet.dat files.  
The wallet.dat (assuming that's the format used) stores a way to get all your private keys.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:48:53
No.  
Coinbase and other places are paying 100 sat/byte for no reason. You don't need to pay more than 2 sat/byte (even 1 might go through in the next block). 
People are overpaying, even if you're a business. It makes no difference. If you pay more than 2 sat/byte right now, to get in the next block, your fee discovery algorithm is just failing. Or you just don't give a shit about paying a little bit more. 
Average is meaningless in this case, because someone is paying 1000 sat/byte sometimes and simply breaks the average.
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:13:20
Bitcoin tried to become a widely used currency, but it must stay decentralized.  
A distributed ledger is not the most optimal solution for anything, but it's the most optimal solution while staying decentralized.  
If you don't need decentralization, might as well use a regular old database, which is what those systems do.  
Still, I don't want to take away from what alipay achieved by allowing 256k transactions per second during the busiest (chinese) shopping day of the year.  
But yeah, not decentralized!, it's like comparing apples to oranges.

As far as I understand it, the importance of a full node during the 2X fork is that these nodes will not retransmit 2X transactions, and will only transmit the regular ones.  
And having one setup ahead of time is good because node discoverability is based sort of on how much uptime a node has.
If there are a lot of 2X nodes, then those nodes will win in the end.
But I'm not sure about any of this, it's just how I understand it.

You don't need to use coinbase's wallets. In fact, it's not recommended.  
You should use a wallet on your PC, and you should keep your seed words / private keys safe in case your hard disk breaks.  
There are good guides on the right side, like this one:  
You don't need a bank account, except to buy it in some exchanges like kraken. But some accept credit cards, and you can also get bitcoin at certain ATMs.
coinbase is actually one of the most recommended places to get BTC. for europeans it's kraken.
So you would buy your bitcoin from someone and then send it to your own wallet.
If it's a decent amount, a hardware wallet is also recommended. And there is also a way to put your money in a paper wallet if you really want to just hold it for a few years.

@_date: 2018-07-24 09:40:06
What do you mean by "also"?
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:04:29
It's not a trivial thing to do (specially if you want it to be 100% safely and secure /paranoid mode), but this will help you get started:  
But like others said, you should take the BCH out first, and I would personally recommend a hardware wallet. 8 BTC is worth it.
Steps to take the BCH out safely:  
* In october there was a fork. Whoever had BTC before, ended up with BTC and BCH. BCH is the fork nobody uses, and it's decreasing in value, so people are telling you to sell it. I agree with that. So basically the same address that had Bitcoin (BTC), now has both, Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash (BCH/BCC).
Depending on what software you use, you can send bitcoin, or bitcoin cash to somebody else. I don't know which software can see the BCH, but for example Copay can.
1. You need to know where your bitcoins are and what your private key is. It might be in a few addresses, you will need them all, and their private keys.
2. Send your BTC to another address (always remember to have a copy of your private key!) You will be using the old private key into other software, most are secure, but just in case, better to move the real BTC out to another safer address.
3. Import the private keys into a wallet that supports BCH
4. Send that BCH to bittrex.com (they call it BCC), or other exchanges that support it)
5. Sell it for BTC.
6. Send the BTC back to your new address.
7. Make a backup of your Bitcoin private key.

Do you agree with me at least that it's messes up thar my salary has to go through a bank (and they profit). And that charging 30 euros for an international transfer + exchange fee is bad?  
And I am not taking about how bitcoin is today. It needs a lot more merchant adoption, and to fix the scalability problem.  
 Scalability is being fixed by LN.  
And volatility will be fixed (also supposedly) if bitcoin price rises more (which I believe it will).  
And yeah, not everybody will want to be their own bank, some banks will hold the btc for you, but I prefer to be my own bank and not have a third party hold my money.

Bitcoin can't address the problem of people having fat fingers.  
But wallets should show warnings for situations like that. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 15:01:15
Besides what others have said, what I like most about bitcoin is that nobody owns my money except me.  
Right now I get paid, and I need a bank account for it. The bank receives the money and plays with it, making profits. They don't really give me anything back for it, except they keep it safe and the convenience of paying bills and credits cards. If Bitcoin was more widely used, I wouldn't need an intermediary to keep my money. No intermediary to pay my bills, no intermediary to receive my salary.   
I have also travelled a lot, and banks always take some percentage for trading currencies. And it costs me 30 euros for an international SWIFT transaction (to my own account in another country).  
So strangely enough, for me one of the best parts of Bitcoin is the P2P part. Although most of the other properties are necessary for the P2P part to exist.
@_date: 2018-07-17 15:14:53
Then I'll be sure to have a script that spends the transaction with a higher fee and send the money to myself instead.

A few months ago transaction fees were higher than $10. Now they're like 3 cents.  (500+ satoshis per byte VS 2 satoshis per byte now)
Segwit makes use you less satoshis, so you could end up saving money now. Maybe not. If the amount is big enough and you're not worried about having to sell quickly in the future (when there might be a huge spike in fees again). Then I'd say it's not worth the trouble or risks.

These are simple "one click" programs that just mine whichever coin has the best value at the moment and they can pay you the equivalent in bitcoin after you've mined for a certain amount.

I'm not good with words, someone has explained it better somewhere in this thread.  
But shorting Bitcoin means you're borrowing bitcoins, selling them, then buying again when the price is lower and keep the profits.  
If price goes up too much, you get liquidated and the exchange takes whatever you got to pay for the btc you sold,even at such high price.  
Lots of people were shorting and they got rekt.

Actually not just your $1000, but whatever you had as collateral. The more collateral you have, the higher your margin for the price to go the other way.
price is $6k, I short $1000 at 10x, if the price goes to 6.1k, I need to have in my account $1000 extra, if it goes over what I have, then I get liquidated and I lose my initial $1000 and my collateral $1000.

Don't cheer, but they are necessary.  
Better now than later, it gives motivation to work and support more anonymity features.

If the BCH fork was meant to be the real bitcoin, then it shouldn't have needed an emergency difficulty adjustment. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 18:41:46
I thought that we sort of reached that point already?
Is any fork worth more than 5% of a BTC? Except BCH, and maybe BTG?
@_date: 2018-04-26 16:08:39
not with THAT attitude!
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:44:02
Bitcoin Core is an implementation of Bitcoin.  
Bitcoin is Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-28 16:05:23
He already have a lot of BTC when the fork happened, maybe his goal is to get as much BTC as possible without day-trading. But with his influence, he tries to pump the price to sell the BCH for more BTC.
But of course this is just one theory, only he knows.
@_date: 2017-10-16 09:41:44
I showed the price of BTC to my brother yesterday, he said: "if I had any I would sell them immediately!"  
- why?  
- Because it's always better to have money in hand than risk it like that.
Well, I think it's better to save money than to spend it, and better to save it as BTC than as dollars.
@_date: 2018-02-04 02:14:08
Is there a way to know how many transactions are happening over the LN?
I know that right now there aren't that many, but it should still be a number there somewhere.
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:34:30
Thanks for correcting me.
@_date: 2017-05-17 12:58:44
Ideally, something will be done to resolve this soon.
They are larger now because of reasons.
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:24:49
HODL isn't about not spending your crypto. It's about not daytrading.  
Because there are people whose job it is to daytrade, their job is to program the bots that can outsmart you. They will outsmart you, and they will take your valuable crypto.  
If you think you're a good day trader go ahead and daytrade, but if not, you will most likely end up losing money (even if you win some times).
But yeah, spend it if you can, just don't try to trade it unless you absolutely know what you're doing.
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:45:22


Are you sure?  
What if right now Paypal just opens an exchange where you can trade BTC for paypal money?, and amazon said they've implemented it?  
Price would sky-rocket.  
@_date: 2018-04-06 09:35:28
Don't worry too much about it, just try to keep your addresses private. And wait for mimble wimble and other solutions.  
This is just another obstacle for bitcoin to overtake.
@_date: 2018-04-26 17:35:01
Don't know, I just read it somewhere. But like I said, no sure way to know.
But there are many ways to make bitcoin unrecoverable.
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:14:34
Yes. 
No. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:00:17
The Mt.Gox guy is prepared to dump 16k BTC on the market, so he is preparing the shorts.  
Not saying this is true, or it's happening, but it's an "obvious" reason that comes to mind.
@_date: 2018-04-14 11:48:39
What's with the old news all the time?
@_date: 2018-04-26 13:47:51
Maybe most of those are just assuming a 10 minute block?
@_date: 2018-04-26 18:35:17
Receive Bitcoin to your wallet in your PC, format PC, LOST.  
Without the private keys, there's technically no way to recover them.
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:28:10
I read somewhere that the number of shorts was at an all time high.  
And somewhere else that some exchanges were manipulating prices to liquidate longers/shorters.
I guess this is the result?
Don't trade on margin, bigger fish want your money and they will take it.
@_date: 2018-04-12 09:27:10
It will make a difference to customers. Segwit doesn't just lower your fee when sending, it lowers everyone else's fees by not using so much block space.  
When one day they want to consolidate, they will have to pay more fees, occupy a lot of block space, and if fees are high then, it will end up increasing fees for everybody else.  
And it won't even take that long to implement.
@_date: 2018-04-09 19:03:25
He said "worth less", not "worthless"
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:37:42
what if I use Bitcoin core?  
I've been out of the cryptocoin world for more than a year and I'm kind of lost with all that's happening now.
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:44:15
So tiny
@_date: 2017-07-10 20:15:57
because normies are coming!
@_date: 2018-04-14 18:08:05
Maybe this will push adoption for LN. Although I'm not sure that's a good thing yet, until it's more battle-tested
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:14:00
You won
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:14:02
This is pretty much normal with Bitcoin. 
And then there will be people saying "I was waiting for it to drop to X, but it never did and then I bought for Y+ more than what I sold it before!"
This is why HODLers exist. Time in the market &gt; timing the market
@_date: 2017-07-02 19:06:32
It says "choose altcoin" on the screen?
is it BTC/LTC? or ETH?
I assume you can only buy BTC, not get fiat for your BTC right?
@_date: 2017-07-16 09:11:16
I would buy up to the last second as long as I have time to put it back into my offline wallet.
That said, I have no money left to invest.
@_date: 2019-05-15 16:50:02
As long as your phone is secure, yes.
@_date: 2019-05-16 04:38:47
@_date: 2019-05-10 12:29:18
Or he can't afford NOT to invest in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-05-17 13:00:30
wait until it gets processed. Hopefully something will be done soon so this type of delay doesn't happen anymore
@_date: 2018-12-21 07:40:20
I'm sure it's un-labeled prices.  
the numbers on top of each candle are the number of candles with the same pattern (red or green).  
TA shamans believe that when a "3" changes direction, then that and that happens, or when a "7" does this, then whatever whatever.  
They use those numbers instead of chicken bones or tea leaves.
@_date: 2019-05-14 21:55:47
Nodes don't need to mine, the incentive is that you trust only yourself. And miners will keep working to get the fees.
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:00:47

@_date: 2018-12-19 15:19:45
Maybe they mean like, I give them my euros, and they send X BTC to the other person?  
Basically making any Western Union a location to buy BTC.
@_date: 2019-05-24 15:53:34
You don't need to pay a fee for the transaction, but then no miner will add it to the blockchain because why would they.
@_date: 2019-05-04 15:31:32
What do you mean by bitcoin CAN be hacked?
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:01:27
Blocks don't need to have transactions in them though, but yeah, it was just the first block. Only notably for what satoshi wrote on it.
This is an interesting article:
also the reward for the genesis block can't be spent for whatever reason.
@_date: 2018-12-09 19:11:44
And that's why time in the market beats timing the market. There is always a bigger fish who can take advantage of your feelings and get your money.
@_date: 2018-12-16 19:56:29
Centralization is not a feature. The other alts are giving that up foe more features. Guess what? If you're going the centralized route might as well just use a database.
@_date: 2018-12-09 19:45:58
It's one linear chain, unless you think about forked coins like branches that end up dying somewhere.  
One block must be linked to the previous one, if you had 2 parallel blocks, then someone could double spend, which defeats the whole purpose.  
Like the first image of this article:   
I just googled images until I found something ok. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 16:20:56
But those are not bitcoin though.
@_date: 2018-12-02 09:06:53
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:14:40
Yes and no. A large amount of bitcoins is held in exchange addresses, and that bitcoin belongs to millions of people.
@_date: 2018-12-19 12:49:25
Please keep reading some more about how LN really works. You got it all wrong.
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:11:33
You mean centralized.
@_date: 2018-12-09 19:08:02
I'm pretty sure there are many real world use cases for people in Venezuela.
@_date: 2018-12-21 16:49:29
I think he means that after it adjusted, then it's slowly going back up. But yeah, if that's what he meant, then poor wording on his part.
@_date: 2019-05-22 17:26:12
You can sign a message to prove ownership without having to send BTC to anyone. Most wallets have such functions.
@_date: 2018-12-28 14:48:39
Bitcoin has plenty of value.
@_date: 2018-12-01 21:10:53
@_date: 2018-12-16 20:51:26
So does any government, central bankers, PayPal, weibo, Microsoft, Google...  
We already have centralized solutions for all of that, the best feature of bitcoin. That it's trustless, comes from decentralization.    
I don't need to trust anybody to use bitcoin.
Centralization means a single point of failure, a single point of attack. Bitcoin would have died 9 years ago if it was centralized.
@_date: 2018-12-01 21:09:16
S&amp;p is only American if I'm not mistaken?  
Bitcoin, being global, will be affected by it going down, but maybe not as much. Especially once the marketcap is bigger and a few million in sales won't really affect the price much.
@_date: 2018-12-09 19:10:18
If I have a loan of 1 million Venezuelan bolivars for my house and I make 10 trillion on a week, then yes.
@_date: 2018-12-09 07:35:24
"But LN doesn't work"  
- delusional bcasher
@_date: 2018-12-09 07:22:46
Your bitcoin is as safe as that device is though. In your case your pc might be super secure, but this is not advice for the general public with 10+ virus running around their systems.
@_date: 2018-12-21 19:51:49
The graph itself is price.  
Which is what I meant, and just in case he meant the sequential numbers I explained those too.
@_date: 2018-12-15 11:34:35
I don't think it's fair to say the USD is monopoly money though.
@_date: 2018-12-09 07:29:21
Because most of us who day traded and tried to time the market got too emotional and ended up being manipulated by day trading experts. We ended up with less bit AND less fiat than if we had held and just waited.  
Unless it's your job, I wouldn't day trade.  
I called some tops and some bottoms correctly, but at some point you made a bad call and lose all your gains.  
Time in the market &gt; timing the market
@_date: 2018-12-09 14:46:26
Short term vs. long term.
@_date: 2018-12-19 07:05:16
I've had 2 stories like that happen to me.  Where the bank just misshandled my money.  
Not to mention having to explain where the money is coming from every time, or being limited to exchange only a certain amount because they think only criminals would exchange more.
@_date: 2018-12-21 07:41:17
after 210,000 blocks, so yeah, roughly every 4 years.
@_date: 2019-05-15 17:34:48
This is not like last time.   
You're forgetting a major improvement to the network that happened mostly at the end of the last bull run.  
Coinbase and others started batching transactions.  
At some point coinbase went down and we saw the mempool started to empty very quickly.  Batching transactions reduced the mempool significantly and we didn't have that when fees were $40.
@_date: 2018-12-28 15:12:04
It's impossible to really know. But for example coinbase said that they had 5 million new users in 6 months at one point.  
We don't know how many are holding their bitcoin there without an actual wallet. So unless they've mentioned it themselves somewhere, I don't think there is a way to know. Any guess could be off by a huge margin.
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:46:39
How can I give them my money?
@_date: 2018-12-09 22:02:51
But dollars are blocked apparently.  Btc is completely digital and can be used more anonymously.
My point is, there is your use case.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:56:26
I don't know, but maybe there is a way to get the private key from the wallet file, then you could import it into another wallet software
