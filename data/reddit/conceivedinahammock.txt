That makes you an outlier in the echo chamber known as r/bitcoin.

It's a little confusing at first, but there't tons of cool features.

So they're claiming to not be a stock of any kind.  "Virtual Stock" seems like a creative title.

If it was just that, people would just ignore it, or make fun of it (like they do with Feathercoin, or any of the other alt currencies that offer nothing new).  That doesn't explain the hatred and blanket writing it off that has been posted.

I did.  I used Euros and Bitstamp as a gateway.  Smooth, easy overall process.  Will definitely be doing so again in the future.

Interesting.  Why do you think surpass, and not coincide?

Is XRP really intended to be a bitcoin killer?  If that were the case, too many people would be worried about Open coin flooding the market/making it too volatile of a currency.

I'm not trying to shut them down or anything.  I'm merely curious about how they incorporated/work.

While it can't go out of business, if people stop using it, the value will drop (as low as 0 if everyone stops using it).  Technically not a bankruptcy, it's not the sure thing you portray it as in your post 
(not that I think that will happen, just that it could).

Dwolla and CampBX is a very simple and cost-effective process.
I have also used Ripple to buy BTC, and had a very positive experience doing so.

Bitcoin wasn't completely open source when it was first released (as it is now).  It seems like a lot of people fall into the pitfall of having expecting a product in beta to be a good as a fully developed product.

That would be legitimate if Ripple was to be used as a currency. But it is more of a postage stamp than a currency.  So why do people care.  Not trying to be snippy, genuinely curious.

While cool, not really an alt currency.  It's more of an crypto postage stamp.
