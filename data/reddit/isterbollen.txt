Thank you for your awnser! Very helpful :D
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:44:26
Definitely agree with that first sentence. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:24:39
Hahaha good one :D
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:23:35
This actually sounds kind of plausible.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:49:54
Unfortunately not all wallets allow you to increase the fees once you send a transaction. I am not familliar with the Electrum wallet, but there is probably information about it online. If you can't increase the fee, I am affraid the only thing you can do is wait. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:41:20
buy other cryptos lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:56:44
Nah man
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:07:51
Crash down a few thousands and then steady growth back, maybe somewhere around 14k. 
This growth can't keep happening forever. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:07:31
Why not trade them for a coin that's actually useful/stable when you have it on Binance already :P ?
Otherwise I would say no with all these fees around (unless it's a huge amount of BTC). Binance is a trusted exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:46:44
That's what BCH already did
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:26:33
These current fees are insain! When can we expect to implement the lightning network?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:06:13
HOOOOLLLLDD CADET! THESE STORMY DIPS WON'T MAKE US FOLD!
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:57:27
Also begging is against the rules on the sub
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:08:40
Pump up the transaction fees. Other than that, no.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:59:59
HERE WE GO! HODL ON TO YOUR COINS AND BE READY FOR THE RIDE!
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:01:51
Yea what the hell is going on here
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:56:26
That's how life is sometimes sadly, don't dwell on it :). 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:03:18
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:27:38
BTC is currently mainly used as trade pairs for other crypto coins and as a store of value. As a currency, it has been far surpassed by other coins.
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:11:23
because of the fees, daytrading other coins is fine.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:00:46
WOuld you be able to spend them twice then? Once on the first branch and once on the other or would they all have to go into one of the resulting ranches once you dedicate them to that branch?
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:52:27
The same argument can be made for 0.1 btc, and with time 0.01 btc. The profit is still there in equal percentage. The big thing people seem to forget is that you don't have to buy a whole bitcoin when investing. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:48:16
I'd say is actually a good source of information. The rest are to different degrees echochambers though (this sub being one of the bigger ones tbh).
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:04:01
Hope you mistyped WW2 there, Nazi Germany wasn't a thing back during WW1 dude.

time to move on mate
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:25:28
I'd honestly buy now if I were you and had money for it. There could easily be a 5k increase more at this rate before the crash and then current prices might actually still be lower than the ones that will be the low of the crash. 
edit: just realised how much this contradicts my original statement lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:56:52
That's one unlucky bastard
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:56:13
If you have been in since September you should still have made some very nice profits even if you drop out now. I would personally trade the BTC into alts having more succes than BTC atm and then transfer them ack into BTC if you ever feel like it. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:20:24
Maybe, but I don't think so. The problems of only having 1 MB blockchains have become very clear the last month with the extreamly high fees and transaction times. This won't change until the lightning network gets implemented (which  honestly could never happen or just be to far away for the coin to recover from the wait). Bitcoin at its current state is useless as a currency, which was the main thing it had going for itself. 
I think that bitcoin will slowly decline, while other cryptos increase. The whole crypto market is linked to bitcoin though at the moment so when it suffers, pretty much all of crypto does. 
If you are interested in cryptos, I would suggest some other coin. But at the moment the whole crypto market is rocking so it is a risky thing to do.  The time of constant raise in price is over. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:01:40
You do you :)
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:09:35
This is why people are switching to BCH. I suggest doing some research into the difference between BTC and BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:48:58
Nice! I am very satisfied with my own nano ledger and I hope you will too!
@_date: 2018-05-21 19:46:58
Didn't valve withdraw bitcoin payments?
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:59:05
Would the adress contain equal amounts of the both resulting currencies from the fork though or would you lose out on one of them? (For example for the btc and bch split)
@_date: 2018-06-04 08:48:58
You monster.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:30:00
Buy now or wait for potential dip? I´m already in the game but thinking about weather i should get in deeper now or wait this hype out and then strike?
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:43:29
hard to predict right now, I will myself hold off from buying more for some time more, its likely going to drop like 10-20% in the week to come (or it raises by another 2k, what do I know)
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:03:37
This. I made the misstake of panic selling during the China crash. I bought back in later but I lost a BIG chunk of the possible % gains I could have made if I had just held it all.
Lesson: Hodl
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:08:58
money laundry.
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:34:58
not really it will probably keep falling until like 25 september
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:13:51
fucking sell now then, this crash is not about to stop anytime soon
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:09:32
THE END IS NIGH!
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:27:22
Great! I just did the same
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:26:51
If all money and precious metals suddenly disappeared complete anarchy would occur worldwide and bitcoins woul d be the least of your problems. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:43:54
yea I feel pretty shit now lol
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:03:48
go ahead, this crash will last atleast another week, i´ll buy then. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 00:20:36
Yea this is obviously the case, you'd have to be blind to reality to think otherwise. However steps are slowly made for it to actually turn into a currency rather than a compltely speculative asset. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:59:22
I'd say its fairly good, all the exchanges have fees and you will never get around that. Coinbase is as good as any other site really.
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:42:39
You obviously didn't stick to your promise then as it went past 10k and beyond in December. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:03:48
go ahead, this crash will last atleast another week, i´ll buy then. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:51:47
Got to accept the risk of this insain fluiity in price, learn from your misstakes I suppose.
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:39:20
How is this any more worthless than all the "go for the moon"  and hodl memes?

Sold at 2950 usd, feels bad man.

Probably a good call, in case you buy back once it dips further and THEN hold on to it. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:29:33
Never invest more than you can loose, bitcoin is one of the most risky things you can ever invest in

No, this is a modified version. This is the original :

Pull out now before more damage is done, buy back when the tide saddles. Evade the fall, join back on the climb. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:13:09
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:15:05
people are just scared to predict the market, holding is more secure but definately less rewarding than succesfully playing the market. Myself, and I bet others aswell, don't really even have enough BTC to have it worth it to try to sell and then buy back because of transaction fees and trade site fees just evens it out anyway. It would have to be a huge drop for it to be worth it. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:42:57

Amazing :D

@_date: 2017-07-20 23:27:39
and now its on its way up again lol, this is crazy.
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:29:24
its heading back up this instant! Its insain how fast this thing fluctuates!
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:42:09
Haha, can relate to that.
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:37:01
Price correction, always ends this way at a massive spike.
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:19:19
I am not going to be awe struck that it DOESN'T suck for once, it should't be acceptable that the biggest transaction site for BTC crashes, even when high traffic arrises.
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:00:05
very bad deal, the coin is closer to 2200~2300 right now.
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:02:02
Think it will drop to 2700~2600 at max, then go back up again slowly and steady as it always does.
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:40:40
Fuck, RIP my cash
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:48:03
No, time to buy mate
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:46:07
Indeed, I have a hard time seeing companies implementing bitcoin as a payment method if it continues to go up and down as crazy like this. I mean how can you plan a company budget if the currency just suddenly jumps down 200$ in a few hours? 
Hopefully with time in a few years it will stabilize and be stable enough for trade and not just an investment to HODL.
