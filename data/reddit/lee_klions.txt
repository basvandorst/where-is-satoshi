If he accounted for the US and global recession cycles.
It’s already apparent that he considered a lot of things, so it’s not unrealistic that he took that into consideration.

“My way and my worldview is universally correct.”
That’s how your reply come across, idk if you meant it that way or not. Should I get kicked out of the house at 18? Should I pay my family for rides to the airport? Different people will have differing opinions and family dynamic. Different Culture, Race, Religion, Geography create a variety of family structures. Mine to answer your question is fine with it.
Too many people on this sub try to tell others what’s correct. While I appreciate the fact that your comment had good intentions, it’s still comes across as overbearing.
I bet you a large portion of people reading this have interesting thoughts and ideas they refuse to share in this subreddit because instead of a opening up a dialogue, the comments are full of shallow polarized replies of absolutes.
Ask me why I don’t diversify.    
Ask me what my goals are. Short, medium, long term?
Maybe i’m too optimistic expecting a discussion rather than two circle jerks that happen to share the same subreddit.
Sorry to use you as a scapegoat, but I gotta vent about the state of this sub.

Buy Gold directly with Bitcoin and send that gold to him.

Take conventional knowledge and toss it out the window. If it makes sense for Bitcoin to go down in a recession, then it will go up. I have no way to explain this but compare it to a protagonist in a story who has the odds stacked against him, but contrary to people’s expectations of him failing he succeeds time after time. Over time people start to believe in him and have positive expectations. Combine this with FOMO.
Think of the headline “GOLD DOWN WEAK DOLLAR STOCKS CRASHING but BITCOIN STILL ON THE RISE”. 
Another thing is, ok say Bitcoin doesn’t crash in a recession and it actually does quite well. That is a HUGE question answered because a lot of people were unsure about Bitcoin because it has never gone through a recession period.
What I just said may sound dumb to some of you, and that’s fine. Only time will tell.

Turn off Forbes notifications.
If you think you’ve done far more hours of research on Bitcoin than a random Forbes writer, they probably don’t have anything constructive to offer you.

Sat in on a dinner outing in China as a teenager where the local Governor/Mayor of a developing province was coming to visit. In his entourage were apparently the people who had a monopoly on windows, flooring, various development companies.
Top restaurant, great view, private room. Best seafood i’ve had in my life.
