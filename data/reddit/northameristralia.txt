You definitely support Roger ver and his bullshit don't you
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:39:01
shut up nerd
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:03:02
I agree with this dude.  Get the bcash, sell it, give that to your parents.

Hey,  don't mess with South Amerstralia. There was a moment in time where North and South Amerstralia controlled the front page for a while. r/Amerstralia baby
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:29:10
It was 105,000......
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:57:50
Thank you, it's what I'm here for. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:30:23
You're not getting me mr. Undercover IRS agent
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:42:29
Ok I believe you. Roger wouldn't talk like that about himself. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:26:25
Stop sucking, sell your crypto, get off this sub, and go back to playing baseball cards
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:10:13
How was your tinder match? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:55:10
Obviously you did zero research. These questions could be answered by Google. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:41:40
Get out of here noob. The major cryptos are on sale right now, you should be buying. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:15:58
Wave good bye to it champ
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:02:21
Yea I understand,  I'm just used to doing everything myself that's all. I posted on r/jobs4bitcoin but apparently no one wants to find out how to beat a DUI charge hahaha
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:13:05
 Please don't share any more of your completely wrong percentages and ideas. Thank you
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:30:42
 Yea man.  I refinanced 2 years ago.  1000 a month until I'm 45 years old. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:05:23
So many people are overlooking this exact idea. Bitcoin was used to make smaller purchases. Now,  it will be the gold of crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:49:23
no this won't count for your parole and probation paperwork as having a "job"
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:28:43
Super Fake News

@_date: 2017-12-22 19:24:44
Like I have testicular fortitude and happy that crypto was on sale
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:25:26
Tuition. 28 thousand a semester ( I paid 13 thousand to 14 thousand). I worked during school to pay for living expenses and played baseball
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:03:27
Well,  from years past,  35% is not nearly the worst. I would call it,  "A carefully orchestrated chain of buy/ sell walls along with Roger ver and mainstream media being a bunch of fucking Aholes."
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:43:23
 Oh....... good job OP
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:14:53
Good shit OP
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:11:16
Haven't you read the the posts about crypto and those of us who have been in it for years?  No one cares about your panic sell story. It's your own fault for not knowing how the market fluctuates. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:03:06
 Usually in the drawer next to the knives, spoons, and other various eating utensils.
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:40:39
Haha I wish man, not in public service. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:56:42
 That would be great,  but I wouldn't be able to afford that.  I'm just hoping within next 15 years I will have enough in crypto to pay off the last 4 years worth of payments at 1 time. And I would definitely buy again,  however I believe when that time comes cryptos would be way out of my price range. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:18:35
Take my upvote
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:43:30
 Yea it's rough, but it was the debt I signed up for. Learning to live on less. It led me to my career and I believe helps make me a better person. I could have it forgiven in less than 10 years,  but it's not fair to make US tax payers pay for my debt. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:57:28
Can confirm, I'm the CEO
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:46:18
Yea I mean that's true. We're around 700 officers short of what we're supposed to have. No one is signing up and I really can't blame people.  But still, it was my choice to go. It wouldn't feel right making others pay for that decision. It's rough but makes you appreciate some things.... Like managers specials on meat and double coupon Fridays haha. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:57:36
You don't bet on crypto. Idiots like you are the reason the market is so volatile at this point and transactions are high. Take your bet to the horse track dick
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:51:48
which is very good and is still to high. Look at the a crypto graphs from the beginning to prior to the week before thanksgiving.
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:31:56
 Thanks bro, paid off 40 000 from working, hoping crypto can make the next 65 easier
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:19:51
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:16:22
Ha jokes on you, there is no rule 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:09:07
I mean, if you need a name for it,  I would call it a brief slumber in a short term downward direction momentarily. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:15:14
I'm buying all of it during dip so in 5 years I can laugh at everyone else's expense
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:55:40
I'm thinking between now and second to third week of January it will stay between 11250 and 14500
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:29:38
Yea a house would be sweet, I'm looking at usda loans hoping my debt to income isn't too much.  Renting is just throwing money away because you don't own it. That's why I try to work 80 hours a week to help save. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:55:02
Well when you're 18, nothing sounds to ridiculous.  I figured it wouldn't be that hard (hindsight is 20/20). Honestly I think it makes me better at what I do.  What kills me is the interest. The loan was 105, but with interest I will have paid back just over 215 ish.  1000 a month for the next 19 years and change. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:15:10
Get out of here Roger ver

Sometimes going to have to decide, since you can't decide "where to place your bet" idiot
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:02:31
I saw the same thing and high fived my dog
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:52:45
it was repealed like 12 hours ago..... good job
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:59:08
Fake news. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:54:02
have you tried google yet or bother to read any other thread besides asking the same question that no one knows the answer to?
