Late to this but thank you for posting this. Incredible read, both parts.

That was my thoughts as well. "Oh awesome, I can support the community! But... I'll have to eat subway..."

Happened the last time [coins were reported stolen]( too.

Exactly. The volatility is common for groundbreaking new things in their early stage, us as consumers rarely see it though because it's before a company's IPO.

At least he got to finish Breaking Bad.

Smart people make mistakes. He's not stupid. He just slipped up. Once.

Just heard the interview with these two on LetsTalkBitcoin today! They seem to have their heads on their shoulders pretty straight. From a marketing standpoint the tagline, "Couple travels entire globe using only bitcoins" does wonders for the community and those who aren't aware of it yet.

Ah, there it is. There's the comment chain that made my morning. I can get outta bed and get ready for work now. Keep up the good work, boys.

On his linkedin profile it does state that he worked as a research scientist for five years. Not quite there but close enough.

What if you do both? Say your normal password is something like 0d981jt would a password like "correct horse battery 0d981jt give you anymore bits of entropy?

What's your incentive for this? Just to have fun?
@_date: 2013-11-08 14:45:06
No it isn't you ass. 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ...OH MY GOSH THE PASSWORD IS ASS.

I'm getting mixed signals here. Either "Duh, of course it will be" or "No, you're an idiot for thinking that". I have a feeling it's the latter.
I'd suggest watching [this video of the S Curve explanation]( in it's entirety. The basic gist is that the S Curve of these groundbreaking advanced usually peaks out in the 1000% - 8000% growth/year rate for a year or two before beginning to plateau. We're currently at 5000% in the last year of BTC so we very well *could* be beginning to hit that plateau in the coming months to year. Personally I believe we're still in the very beginning of this upward curve, especially as the community booms.

Yet. The whole point is that they were switching over to BTC early before mainstream adoption.

I met a 19 year old kid in the BTCe trollbox a couple days ago who PM'd me and gave me his Skype ID. Stupid as it was, he shared his screen and showed me his 573 coins.
...I was a greeter at urban outfitters when I was 19.

It has for me. Unfortuantely I've already transfered my USD to Mt.Gox and I can't buy. Wat do.

It's a good idea but has a bad downside... Some douchebag like me comes along and reposts this image but first simply [replaces the QR code]( and we have common thieves.
