My Dwolla transaction went though today.  Everything is already back up.
@_date: 2011-07-19 23:53:04
Just when they fill up.  There are, atm, about 28 people online and about 18 people registered, so, who knows?

Did someone say [referral]( number?  TH-R1266

Who here believes the holding account bitcoin wallet wasn't on the server, too?  Or, that they've fixed the flaw which permitted the intrusion to begin with?  If you think the prior bitcoin theft was large, just wait until the entire Mt. Gox holding account vanishes.
Yup, and there's my email address for all to read.  Well, guess that one's toast for junkmail. 
So you should move everything to TradeHill now, right?  And use my [referral code]( to get an extra 10% off when you do: TH-R1266, right?
Not that I think tradehill is any more immune to hacking than Mt.Gox was...

You can try contacting support.  The admin is on right now (check how much time has elapsed since I posted this).  It was easy enough for me, anyway.  Try a different username/pass/email?

I sure hope your holding wallet is not on the same machine that your web site was on.  That, and I hope it is not easily accessed from the web server.

It's actually a nice site considering they run in BTC and not USD.

11 AM Dwolla time, mtgox-&gt;dwolla
@_date: 2011-06-19 21:48:34
That doesn't do much for my confidence.
@_date: 2011-06-19 20:17:48
I don't know why they would either, but does that mean they didn't?  I hope it does.
@_date: 2011-06-12 16:57:59
Supposedly not, and I'm not sure what the laws are with regard to that.  My (very limited) understanding is that there is some law or another which requires you to register as a money exchange if you allow more than $1000 per day to be exchanged per person, but I don't know if the law is a US law or an international one.

Mt Gox mentions that if you want to withdraw more you can contact them.  They probably ask for your ID and whatnot.

No, I mean like everyone's trades being reverted.  Sony did not put at risk individual people's life savings, or cause peoples bank statements to get "rolled back."
But have a laugh for equating "I can't play my PS3 online" with "I lost $500,000 at MtGox."
@_date: 2011-06-08 22:22:57
There's a new exchange, too.    Here's my referral code, if you want one.  It gets you a 10% discount: TH-R1266

Not that I am saying you should sell (or that you should hold), but this isn't this classic definition of greed?  "I invested some money, made a return of 3000%, but I'm not willing to sell because I think there's more ahead!"  I mean, I do agree that $50 isn't much money, and it seems a shame to sell if you really believe that $50 is going to become $50,000, and yet...

Plenty of people are buying bitcoins, but be careful because the price of bitcoins are being driven by demand for the speculative currency vs./ the small supply of it due to the greed of bitcoin holders hoping the price will go higher yet.
The current marketplace for bitcoins is very small.  How many people are using bitcoins to actually purchase goods, most of which are illicit?  Maybe a few thousand.... I doubt it is even in the five digit range yet.
If the price ever starts on a serious downward trend, do you think those who hold bitcoins will choose to "ride out the storm?"  I doubt it.  There will be a massive wave of selling, and the price will fall like a rock.
After that, who knows?  Will people try to push the price up again?  Will they be gun shy?  Some people will view the massive selloff as a chance to get rich quick by buying up thousands of bitcoins on the dollar, but will anyone step up to pay $20 ($100?  $1000?) each again?
On the other hand, there are only a few million of the things around.
Here's the important point:  what is going to drive the price of bitcoins up or down is the purchase and sale of them by people who have no clue what the value of bitcoins should be, very much like how people blindly put their 401k money in whatever fund their employer chooses regardless of what the market is doing, and who all believe they can sell at the peak before the market collapses, but will miss the peak because they're too busy holding on to their coins while it passes them by.
If you can predict what an ignorant market, some of which is cash poor and some of which is cash rich, will do, then I guess bitcoins are a good investment.  Otherwise, I'd stay out.

Your theory might have some weight to it if it were not for the fact that a database has been released and several passwords already reversed that happened to have no salt.
@_date: 2011-06-10 19:32:58
Not long, as it turns out.  Just a couple of days.
@_date: 2011-06-19 19:21:22
Fair enough, but MtGox is a pretty public face for bitcoin ATM.  The media will not be so discerning.  This will be just one more story about how bitcoin is not as secure as we say it is.
"Why isn't you don't have to put a password into bitcoin to open the file?  Seems so ridiculous."
