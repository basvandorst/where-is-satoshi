Andreas WE LOVE YOU!

Well, I get your point about ownership, but every big project has someone who is working on it and usually that group of people have control over Social Media presence. Project being open source does not change that. One example is [Tor Project]( Developers need some outlet to let the general public know what is going on.
So we are going to go with [ which seems to be the right one.

I'm a developer. Could you explain why Bitcoin doesn't have a market cap? 
@_date: 2016-06-07 12:29:52
I thought this is from Game of Thrones. Hold the door, hodl the door, Hodor.

Was this recorded after the first outage or after the second?
@_date: 2016-06-16 11:31:13
We're going big, guys!
@_date: 2016-06-17 12:14:20
Aren't you risking a lot this way since you can't be sure price will drop afterwards? Except if you have a lot of assets to make the critical impact impact.
Or do you see how market has previously behaved (almost always corrected after such a positive spike) and bet on that?
@_date: 2016-06-01 17:25:27
Don't speak like that with your father!
@_date: 2016-06-21 12:21:50
Just hold. Don't chicken out. Upwards surge on the way.

Good to be in EU for this matter. No taxes on Bitcoin trading, the same as other currencies.

I bought for 300€ in 2014 when Bitcoin was at the peak. Left it untouched as a longer term investment. After the price crash I was left with 70€. Fast forward to May 2016. I randomly checked BTC price chart and noticed the upwards trend and a lot less volatility. Started reading and found out that so many amazing things are being built on top of Bitcoin and once again I was sold. Invested 3000€. My current balance is 3500€, that is 200€ net profit. I am still looking at it as a longer term investment as we can all see how world is more and more connected and this currency enables the technology to march forward with great prospects. 
@_date: 2016-06-14 17:25:13
I am interested in this, will buy if available! 
@_date: 2016-06-15 08:29:19
I don't know much about the internals of bitcoin network so I am speaking purely from the point of a consumer. We really need to speed up the confirmations to take less than a few minutes (ideally less than a minute) otherwise people will not use it. Who wants to wait so long for order confirmation? We already have (super slow) SEPA for that.

That's the best possible motivation. I was working night and day on the app I mentioned (Android only though) and then heard of Blockfolio on one of the blockchain meetups and was totally devastated :) 
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:12:57
Don't think so. This candlestick bar represents 5 minutes and the price went back to previous valuation right away.

It is El Nido, but not sure about beach to be honest. I just landed on this island with a kayak and found out that the only person on this island sells coconuts :)
@_date: 2016-06-05 14:53:11
Great, we're having vacations there in a month. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 21:03:25
How does this compare to Blockfolio? I started to work on something similar but then I found Blockfolio and stopped.
@_date: 2016-11-03 20:19:48
It is abailable almost everywer!

Forget the banks. Do your research on how to diversify and get 10%+ returns. One tip is P2P lending.
@_date: 2017-08-31 02:14:14
I didn't mean BTC P2P lending, but "traditional" P2P lending. Check out Twino, Mintos and similar. They have a buyback protection.
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:11:56
It's Kraken (BTC/EUR).
@_date: 2016-11-01 08:11:39
I love it too! Just donated:)
@_date: 2016-11-05 09:20:28
Wow they were fast. I did not know this.
@_date: 2016-11-03 19:05:26
I love these dips since I started to make money on them :)
@_date: 2016-11-05 21:04:33
Oh $% Too late now. No need to pour your bitcoins there.
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:19:33
Thank you very much! Yes, I am doing the coding. I love programming and I love crypto, so this is a very interesting project for me.
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:02:02
If I understand corectly, this way all info about your coins int hese addresses could get automatically parsed and then you would have your portfolio with gains and losses withouth having to type in the values and dates manually? Is this what you are looking for?
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:58:54
Is Slush an Octopus?
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:24:46
I see what you mean - notifications are always present for selected coins. I might implement this too, seems like a nice feature. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:05:37
Try [Airdrops - Free Crypto Tokens](
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:01:44
I am doing it since the elementary school. Also did Masters in Software Engineering so it's always been my path really. You just learn bit by bit, slowly, and apply it.  
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:18:54
Thanks! I am working on portfolio as we speak but it takes time to properly implement it and test it thoroughly. I also give a lot of though to automatization so I will try to offer an option to parse your address history and automatically deduct/add transactions on-the-fly.
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:45:17
Well.. I don't think you can get around the programming part :)

Fuck Bitmain.
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:33:32
Thank you for considering it and spreading the awareness. I am sure karma will come back to you in terms of marketing.
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:28:13
Of course, HODL! :) It depends how south you go, but generally the daily temperatures are around 10deg celsius and not much rain. It's best if you do a research on your own based on where you want to go. I wouldn't know about Spain, but I guess southern Spain has nice weather even during winter (but you won't be able to swim). What I do know is that Malta, the little island in the middle of Mediterranean, has the best weather in Europe with most sunny days and about 15degrees celsius even during winter.

As a Slovenian this is nice to hear. But then again, I am hoping to see banks wiped out and totaly replaced by blockchains.
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:14:23
A quick search shows there are already at least 2 Monero wallets on Google Play (didn't check App Store). 
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:25:08
iOS version is being built as we speak. I guess it will be ready next week, so stay tuned!
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:41:59
In case of a crash (or user submitted feedback) app log can also be sent for easier debugging. This comes with [maoni library](
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:02:39
I do not recommend it, it can break the simulation.

Will make a motorbike trip from Hanoi to Saigon (1800km+). Thanks Bitcoin.

Sure, for more serious ideas I am willing to sign NDA, show my previous work and legitimate myself with LinkedIn.

I'm from around this area, welcome! 
The graphs are temperature/precipitation charts. It's quite important for me since I'll be on a motorbike for 1 month :)

I think now is the perfect moment to buy back and get that nice extra  $300/BTC till tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-05-08 17:45:06
I love this answer. Reminds me of my grandpa stories.
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:57:42
Ok, start buying back now.
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:18:35
This. Well said.
@_date: 2017-05-08 17:38:02
This is one of the reasons I like Kraken - excellent support.
@_date: 2016-05-02 17:08:45
Makes sense. Qubits.
@_date: 2017-07-12 20:35:31
If you do a lot to promote Bitcoin, we will!
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:53:29
I sold when it started tanking, will wait an hour, and then buy back.
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:27:27
Enthusiasm here, SWEET!

They are just pushing and trying to force what is the best for them, not for the average user. Ignore them if they don't want to join us, the majority. It's their loss.
@_date: 2017-06-16 07:10:18
We need everything decentralized. Coinbase should sink and a decentralized exchange will rise.
@_date: 2017-06-26 21:04:24
Fair enough. Thanks for sharing.

This does not even run. Line 48 - wrong print usage; line 58 - wrong Exception usage, ...

This is not true or is country-specific as  says. I have withdrawn multiple times without any problem. I am from Slovenia.
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:44:09
Woah, what? What are they thinking?!
