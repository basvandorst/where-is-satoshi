Great, another shitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:57:23
This is one dank fuckin' meme. Love it. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:20:43
Oops too late
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:39:12
Jihan turned off the spam bot
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:56:38
Russian Propaganda is A-OK tho
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:49:16
And Sentinel if you just want a Watch-only wallet
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:26:45
Praise be to Andreas, our true Prophet. When FUDs got you down, just put your faith in Andreas. Amen.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:58:56
Ditto. Using Sentinel Wallet to keep an eye on it while offline. Plus they support segwit! Lovin' it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:10:06
Based Andreas. Praise Him!
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:56:27
It's almost like you could call bitcoin the... internet of money.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:02:31
This guy gets it. Whenever I hear someone talk about increasing the block size just to save a few bucks, I puke.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:57:03
And yet this sub is drowning in FUD. In Andreas We Trust.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:36:39
Fuck off FUD. In Andreas We Trust.
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:12:02
"What do you mean I can't just print more bitcoin??"
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:34:13
It starts as a store of value, ends as a currency. Remember, the internet was dog shit slow back in the 56k days.
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:26:32
What a beautiful man.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:55:02
Just be patient. I've had low fee txns clear in 3 to 4 days. Remember, we're in the 56k modem days of the internet when it comes to Bitcoin. In Andreas We Trust.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:49:06
I used  on an ubuntu server. You'll probably need to install a few other packages not mentioned in the article depending on the VM used.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:31:34
Oh no.. it's wsb's favorite Canadian. Time to sell.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:59:36
She's cheating on you with bitcoin... I don't blame her, really.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:59:50
Angry because he's frustrated that his scam isn't working.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:05:05
Disgusting false prophet. Praise Andreas.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:04:22
Bingo. Trust in Andreas!
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:46:10
Thanks Roger Ver!
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:49:57
LMAO. OP is just all sour grapes.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:51:50
America's fucking dead. Buy Bitcoin. Andreas 2020.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:23:34
Bitcoin don't care.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:38:32
Fuck off with this FUD.
Buy bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:57:47
Oh shit, I didn't realize we could use C I assumed btc was mostly linux and open source. Here we go boys!
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:09:21
To the fuckin' moon!
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:28:00
"Why can't they freeze it??" Lmao...
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:59:47
And we're back to 17
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:35:33
[Lmao. Dis gun' be good.](
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:46:23
Fuck off FUD. In Andreas We Trust.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:12:17
They just realized they can money launder with it. Probably foaming at the mouth to get in as we speak. A buy signal if I ever did see one.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:43:27
Fuck yeah, it can!
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:34:59
Just trust in Saint Andreas. Those at the top are going through the 5 stages of grief. First comes Denial, then comes Anger.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:30:37
Increased blocksize leads to decreased decentralization.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:13:53
Sentinel Wallet is a great watch-only wallet for your Nano/Trezor! I have yet to try Samourai, but it looks like it has a lot of great features. I may use it as a daily-spend wallet eventually.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:09:12
Fuck the FUD. Put your faith in Andreas.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:35:26
THIS is what people should be talking about. This is the value of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:20:03
At least at my bank, this is normal. They decline the suspicious charges and you have to try again after confirming that its you.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:52:57
Their Sentinel watch-only wallet is great for watching your hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:12:49
"Both sides are the same!!"
Only one side is trying to scam you by claiming they've solved the scalability problem when they haven't.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:35:52
Just keep waiting. I recently paid the lowest fee and it took 3-4 days. Worst case scenario, if it never gets confirmed, the btc will go back to your Mycelium wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:50:24
I will probably wait a few months for someone to simplify it a little more, though.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:53:39
but 3x ETFs are a-ok!
Fuck that shit, buy bitcoin
