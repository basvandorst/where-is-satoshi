question because I’m not up to date on bitcoin.  Are there stop loss orders available? I think the new quick money coupled with stop loss orders is where the damage can really happen.

Yeah, I agree on something this volatile. I see this as  an easily manipulated market and somebody is going to do it. The stop loss orders just mean when it hits 10k it goes lower.

People seemed confused about the term Cryptocurrency and applying cryptocurrency to mean only bitcoin.

TLDR: "If you haven't posted taxation is theft 50 times on facebook please sell all your coins and GTFO."

Inflation and the Fed is the only reason rich people can take almost all of the money.  Without a huge supply of funny money there would hardly be anything left for the people who work for a living. It wouldn't be sustainable and everything would crash.

What exactly is bitcoin backed by? An artificially limited supply?

This guy knows whats up.  I'm in several small businesses as a non-accredited investor. You can also only have so many investors before you fall under registered securities too.

Because everybody would be racing to buy it at $10k, $20k ,$30k ,$40k , and $45k.  So they could sell it at $50k. You would be dumb not to.

If somebody really thinks that the world is going to collapse I'm not so sure everybody is going to have a computer/access to the internet to use bitcoins as currency :|
Also, on gold and silver. If things get really bad that will be practically worthless too. Food, water and ammunition.
Things have to just kinda fail.
