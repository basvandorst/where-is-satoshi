If I were to guess, it would be the skewed versions of them in The Social Network that caused an underlying distrust. It did for me when I first heard about him again, but then realized that he is a person and I shouldn't judge him based on the movie version of him. Of course, I know nothing about the real-life Winklevoss twins.
This is all assumption, so Korberos is free to disagree.

Explain your comment. What event is this repeating?
What were we supposed to learn?
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:32:42
It sounds like you have a predetermined opinion about this, which leads me to believe you won't listen to what anyone here says, regardless of the validity of their statement.
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:49:36
Thanks! I finally get to use this :)

The lack of non-designers in here who think they know better is disturbing. This is a good move. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:23:00
At least 3.

Thanks for the tip! How often should I do this? Weekly? I guess it depends in my usage, eh?

True. The film did a good job of showing things aren't black and white. Zuckerberg is the protagonist but probably does the worst things in the film. Everyone else just wanted credit, he thought he was above that. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 18:39:50
Haha touché. This is why I said it is my opinion, I may connect those dots but that doesn't mean everyone will.

I haven't used it, but it's been posted around the subreddit:

The design is nice enough, I just don't know if I'd want to associate Bitcoin with an emergency contraceptive...
Just my opinion.

I'm new as of this past weekend but I haven't seen anything too harsh to newbies. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 23:41:33
Looking good. I'm glad to see them taking security so seriously, as well as handling potential expansion so logically. 
Wish I had more money to buy more than the 20 shares I have!

Warning: I don't know anything about anything.
I feel like this would be detrimental to the company at this stage. Too much growth too fast.
Additionally, I don't know if they'd want international funds mixing with the Cyprus funds.

Hopefully losing traction. People need to realize using a logo as a symbol just isn't smart. I especially hate the people who say "we've been using it for 4 years!" To them I say: are you saying Bitcoin is near the end of its growth? Or, obviously, are we in the infancy stage? Yeah, now is the perfect time to change it. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:11:37
Holy fuck a reddit cofounder posts about his "latest investment", claims it's a better way to trade, and gives ZERO information in the comments?
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:36:15
If you're new to Bitcoin, I suggest reading the [Wikipedia article]( Lots of cool information in there.
ninja edit: Oh, you're being sarcastic, aren't you?
@_date: 2014-03-19 23:18:44
What a terrible response. Should we also not change any code because he decided on it?
I don't understand the comments here. No one has any real feedback except "satoshi picked it". Who the fuck cares? This designer makes a great point. You should not use a logo for a currency. It's just plain stupid. 
If you want to try adding the symbol to Unicode, go ahead. But to say it's fine as it is because the creator picked it? Fucking ludicrous.
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:27:37
Shhh, I got him to change it. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:13:50
I'm on mobile so I can't link it as easy as on desktop, but I'm sure you can find it by typing in "rap battle" or "funny rap battle"
@_date: 2014-03-14 18:40:31
Haha I noticed that. I was like "wtf I didn't post this?"
I think there's a s3v3n7 out there too
@_date: 2014-03-14 20:03:55
When I feel like it I'll go look through my comments, about a year or so ago we "met" and decided to battle in a year.

He might be referring to actual investors in Neo Bee, not havelock investors. I assume there just have been some other way of raising capital than buying pass-through shares. 
I think. I have no idea. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 03:50:49
I don't... I mean I'm very new to bitcoin, but isn't this the opposite of the desired goal of the technology behind bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:54:27
Use Multibit? I mean, I know I'm not helping the network, but it works for me. Is there anything I'm missing with Bitcoin-QT or others? Do transactions confirm faster?
@_date: 2014-03-20 00:02:10
Of course I respect the guy. But that doesn't mean I will blindly accept everything he did as correct/the right way to do something. I am a designer, and I do not mean to sound pretentious because I am not that great, but I completely support the idea posted. We shouldn't hold on to something because "that's the way it's been". For that reason we should stick with the dollar. We shouldn't hold on to something because "we respect the creator". The USA continues to update the Bill of Rights and other aspects of the law, as does every other country, because we understand concepts and realities change. 
I understand people are attached to the current logo. It's fantastic as a logo, it's simple and clearly denotes currency. But as a symbol intended for mass adoption? No.
I do support people trying to get it added to the Unicode standard. I just don't know how quickly that will happen. And how does that update work? Does it come with a Windows update? That plan seems a bit harder to pull off than changing a symbol this early in the game. All this talk of "it's been this way for years already" should be put to rest when you ask yourself how far you want Bitcoin to go.
@_date: 2014-03-28 23:32:27
True, but this has nothing to do with that. No coins are gone. Trading has been halted due to questionable activity. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 01:09:51
And the price of those specific colour coins would rise and fall based on the performance and expectations of the company, independent from whatever the BTC price is?
@_date: 2014-03-28 22:08:58
For anyone questioning Havelock's system, they state [here]( that it is Neo's platform that is experiencing the issues.
@_date: 2014-03-29 00:05:42
I'm sorry, I still don't understand how coloured coins would specifically be used to trade shares. I'm still fairly new to bitcoin. Wouldn't you still need to send your BTC to a holding account?
