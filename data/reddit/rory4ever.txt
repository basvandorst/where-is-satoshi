Hi, thanks again for your comments. I tried to decrypt it using several tools but to no avail, no error message of some kind but it's just that nothing ever happens. 
Not particularly familiar with command line no.

Thanks for the information. At the time I was pretty unfamiliar with BTC and wallets but I am pretty sure I did the following: 
- opened a wallet on blockchain.info. 
- Checked "addresses" and saw one address generated by blockchain.info itself. 
- used the "buy bitcoin" option shown in blockchain.info wallet dashboard
- send x amount of BTC to the blockchain wallet address
- balance shown was correct. 
- backed up mnemonic phrase and created also wallet.aes.json file and put all on an offline and safe place. 
- never looked at it again for like 1.5 years. 
- wanted to check again few weeks ago, but wallet is different now (HD wallet) but was not sure anymore of the password. 
- used mnemonic phrase to retrieve password. 
- logged in using that password -&gt; I was able to get in my wallet
- saw 0.00 BTC there. 
- located wallet.aes.json file but could not find an option to import and decrypt the .json file. 
- googled a bit and found a link to "blockchain legacy wallet import page" 
- was able to load the wallet.aes.json file using the password. Result -&gt; load ok
- blockchain generated a new wallet ID and a new password. 
- logged in using new password -&gt; ok
- checked funds... still 0.00 BTC
the used address shown in "addresses" returned 2 addresses, one old and one new. All addresses shown 0 btc and NO transaction history. 
So it appears to be that I backup a wallet when there was not done anything with it but that is very strange, I am 100% sure there were funds on it. 
Also tried to manually decrypt the json file but several tools on internet crashed while I tried to decrypt it. 
IIRC, all addresses generated by blockchain.info should be in the json file + the private keys associated with it? Also blockchain.info should inform me about the creation of all addresses right? I might be able to retrieve the correct address + payload + private key and import it somewhere but weird thing is that blockchain.info import worked without any errors but still no funds at all. 
Thanks.

So basically I have everything to import it to the blockchain.info wallet and it succeeded but no funds. The BTC address shown in my wallet shows no activity at all. On blockchain scanner it even tell me that the address isnt used at all (?) Decrypt using the github wallet decryption tool didnt work either, some weird java error
