@_date: 2014-12-20 16:32:41
As a BTC owner who sees both positives and negatives of bitcoin (and Bitcoin), this post makes me really nervous.
I'm not an an_cap or a libertarian.  I don't value the decentralized aspect of bitcoin very highly.  But I see the obvious utility of a public ledger.  And I've argued in many posts here, I think cheap/fast &gt; decentralized.
Further, I am nervous about the wealth disparity introduced by Bitcoin, and the large percentage attributed to Satoshi.  And the fact that there's nothing intrinsically valuable about Bitcoin.  I've made posts about these things as well.
So am I a troll?  I don't think so.  But I do get called one here.  So I'm left wondering whether to temper what I say, or risk the scarlet letter.  censorship is a really really slippery slope.

Nobody, aside from wacko libertarians, value decentralization and the fall of fiat.  Bitcoin expects that the layperson will make compromises to support those ideals.  The first crypto to recognize that people simply want fast, easy, and cheap will win.

So.  Did you just make this up, or what?
@_date: 2014-09-15 16:15:04
To police your peer?  It's not.  It wouldn't be your responsibility to tell the people across the table not to steal credit cards.  Or to report them or anything. 
But to knowingly exchange for the proceeds from that illegal activity is a crime.  So Reid isn't culpable for not policing their crime, he's attempting to committing one of his own.

That bitcoin the coin is almost certainly not the best implementation of the protocol.
@_date: 2014-10-03 18:03:28
I'm not selling.  But I would, if there was an easy way of doing so.
I think blockchain based cryptos in general have a lot of promise and room for growth. But this specific implementation? I'm bearish on bitcoin-the-coin, because there's not a lot of value added for bitcoin over altcoins.
And I'm not suggesting that people should go buy altcoins. Rather, I suspect that there's a reason the institutional investments seems to revolve around payment processors and not bitcoin-the-coin.
@_date: 2014-12-17 20:37:47
The problem is that a huge chunk of BTC is owned by a very few people.  With the original (unidentified) miner holding the most.

This seems like a good feature.  I'm a pragmatist.  I don't think bitcoin (or any other digital currency) is going to become some world takeover thing.  It'll be useful for what it's useful for, and not useful for what it's not useful for.  So I do believe that the success of a digital currency must include a healthy coexistence with fiat.

Well there's essentially zero commerce that occurs just in bitcoins.  So I think this network effect is basically zero.  Bitcoin-the-coin transactions are based on (and mostly converted to) USD.  So the ability to spend a bitcoin is actually just the network effect of the dollar.
If we're talking about infrastructure, most of the payment processing/infrastructure built around bitcoin-the-coin can very easily process any blockchain based crypto.  So it's not really creating a network effect or adding value there either.

Unfortunately, you're not really grasping why those things happened to him, and why he is being punished.  A whimsical description of cages and guns is not necessary for this analysis.  Rather, ask yourself whether his actions merited punishment or not.  
To this -- absolutely yes.  Mr. Pascal specifically intended to exchange bitcoins for the proceeds of stolen credit cards.  To be even more blunt, he intended to do a bad thing.  Impossibility is not and should not be a defense to this, because that fact is immaterial to Mr. Pascal's intent.
Punishing attempted crimes (in this case, attempted money laundering is included in the crime of money laundering) is something that has been done for hundreds of years.  Specifically, courts have held that "when the consequences sought by a defendant are forbidden by law as criminal, it is not defense that the defendant could not succeed in reaching his goal because of circumstances unknown to him."  And this is a good thing, because Mr. Pascal was planning on doing something worthy of punishment.  He just did a bad job of it.

Of course it makes sense.  With BTC, the middleman fees directly impact the end users. The middleman fees are paid via block rewards, which inflate the BTC held by the end users.
So for BTC and for WU/MC, the fees do end up on the end user.  It just happens a little differently.

The VC investments are in tech that is portable to any blockchain based crypto.  
I think the question you need to ask yourself is why BTC?  Specifically, this version of it.  What value is there in the specific version of a system that can freely be replaced by a superior system?  This is the reality with any open source product.  So the uniqueness in BTC is what you've invested in with your purchase of BTC.  Don't confuse that with what the VC people are investing in.

Gosh, this is when it becomes a little banal arguing with an evangelist such as yourself.
Bitcoin has a larger network effect than other cryptos, sure.  But compared to the people that might be interested in internet money, it basically has a network effect of zero.  That's right.  Not that many people use BTC.
But it's even worse than that.  The only people that are dependent on the BTC network are the people that have holdings in BTC.  To everyone else (read as: nearly every business that accepts BTC, every  VC in BTC), BTC is interchangeable with any other crypto.
So don't compare IPV4 to IPV6.  Compare IPV3 to IPV4.  There's still few enough users in this space that the house can be completely torn down and rebuilt.
So yeah, I'm using lack of fundamentals to describe a product that has no compelling reason for people or businesses to use it over a superior alternative that can be freely built by anyone.  If you want to use a different word to describe this aspect of BTC, use a word you like better.

So, to clarify:  When faced with evidence that doesn't support your narrative, your response is simply to claim it is fabricated?  Like, do you really actually believe that?  Are you a fucking retard?  
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:44:53
Huh?  Ulbricht is facing charges in Maryland.  Attempted murder charges.  In Maryland, an attempt requires a substantial step.  
Like emailing and paying a hitman.  
Impossibility (like trying to murder someone that doesn't exist) is not a defense to attempted murder.  So all that stuff you said about names and bodies is really irrelevant here.
So will this evidence hold up?  I don't know.  That's why they have a trial.  It seems pretty damning to me.  But the government WILL have to show that the evidence is legitimate (as well as whether it's a substantial step).
But this is unquestionably enough to go to trial.  It is unquestionably above your 'they made this up out of thin air to assassinate his character' narrative.  So I ask again:  Are you a fucking retard?

That would be a legitimate argument if BTC had any sort of network effect.  Disregard the fact that there aren't that many people that own BTC, or that of those who own, not many use it.  
The real kicker here is that most every commercial transaction with BTC is done through a processor.  So where are the pain points of switching blockchain applications?  Some BTC owners would be mad.  But, again, this is a really small number of people.  For everyone else, all the infrastructure simply ports to whatever the next crypto is.
So I think that means that at this point, the fundamentals of BTC are quite bad.  I think you can make a compelling argument to invest in crypto services in general.  And that's why we're seeing institutional money in that area.
@_date: 2015-01-09 20:44:09
Again, there is evidence.  It exists.  This is why I continue to ask whether you're a retard.  Are you a retard?

This is really disappointing, Bruce.  Please get the correct facts and update your narrative accordingly.
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:38:02
Nope.  No moving goalposts.  The argument has been and is exactly the same.  It's that the value of BTC is tenuous because it's a specific version of a system that can freely be replaced by a superior system.  And that the network effect is too small because of the lack of real users and stakeholders.
Amongst the real users, the only ones that are really stakeholders are the ones that have actual holdings in BTC.  Everyone else (read as: all the VCs, all the businesses) just update a bit of code.
So why switch to another?  I donno, a real competitive advantage.  A guarantee of value/acceptance by a large government or corporation could be a very compelling reason to switch.  I have to imagine that the successful crypto that replaces BTC probably sacrifices the thing that most people dont give a shit about (decentralization) for things that most people do care about (usability, stability).

Well, if there was a consensus that we were all going to use changetip to pay for stuff in society, it would be broad solution.  Unfortunately, changetip's solutions only apply to transactions on changetip.
If transactions on the ledger (in this case, the blockchain) are needed to pay for stuff, these front end solutions do not solve the back end speed/cost issues.

I'm asserting that his testimony would not be relevant in the legal sense of the word.
I'm also asserting that even if it was found relevant, under Daubert (this is the standard that US courts use), Antonopolous would not be an expert.  Merit does not equal expert.  The correct person to call in this context would be a computer scientist with relevant research publications.

What a banal post.  Competition is not some binary thing where it's either perfect or shit. Your post really captures the widespread confusion found in You, like many people here, confuse what a free market is (perfect competition, perfect information) with a free-to-do-whatever-i-want market.  Those aren't the same thing.  So you obfuscate the fact that better information leads to better competition.  And that in many cases, regulation leads to better information.
I suggest you invest some time in studying math and economics.  In that order.

A lottery consists of three elements: A prize, consideration, and a chance based selection.  In this instance, the presence of a prize and a chance based selection are undisputed.  This determination hinges around whether there was consideration.
I think many courts would likely find that the premise of millionaire makers (“if a million reddit users give $1 to a redditor…”) make it a lottery because the number of postings are what give the prize value.  Therefore, consideration exists.
Legal jargon aside, one only needs to take a broad look at millionaire matchmakers to conclude that value is indeed given with the postings.  Let’s start by looking at the prize.  What gives this prize value?  The assertion that the winner will have money donated to them.  Why is that assertion valuable?  Because a real pool of potential donors is formed via the postings.  In fact, the relationship between potential donors and value of the prize is almost explicitly stated in the premise of this drawing.  But even if it wasn’t stated so clearly, that would not change the fact that the postings add value to the prize.  And because the postings add value, the postings must constitute consideration.

@_date: 2015-02-07 01:30:08
My idea is that if you're in the business of holding other people's money, you need collateral, insurance, and legitimacy. No more, no less.  And if you cannot provide that, the holding othet people's money business is not for you.  Bootstrapping a wallet or exchange and then going awww shucks and running with the cash isn't acceptable.  It isn't good for BTC, the blockchain, the users, or anything else.  The free market didn't solve those problems, so regulation needed to.
The rest of your post is some banal libertarian rhetoric that isn't particularly relevant here.
@_date: 2015-02-18 21:30:24
Free means perfect competition.  And perfect competition means perfect information.  So yeah, we need a central actor to "help" people tell the truth and be accountable.  Because as you can see from the BTC space, people decide not to do those things a lot.
As for all the somewhat meaningless graphs you posted?  I'm not really sure where you were going with that.  
Ask yourself a better question.  When was the last time your bank (or any bank) was unable to fulfill deposits?  Never in recent history.  And obviously, this is because the of the FDIC and the NCUSIF.  So because of this regulatory scheme, you have perfect information in regards to your deposit safety (which is that your deposit is safe).  So you're able to value services offered and make an informed decision.  One might say that there's a free market of banking services.
Without the regulatory structure (see: BTC), you're unable to accurately assess whether a bitcoin exchange or service will make good on its deposit.  Or whether it'll do what it says it'll do.  So a free market is unable to function.
@_date: 2015-02-06 22:54:21
Sorry, I misread your post.  Yes, e-wallet services absolutely need to be regulated.  The free market did not answer the call for stuff like accountability, insurance, and solvency.  So this is very necessary.

Yes, I think Judge Forrest has done an excellent job.  And you touched on what is likely happening.  The defense is testing different strategies so that they may keep the possibilities of an appeal open.
As for the next part, it is my opinion that Ulbricht should absolutely not take the stand.  It is my opinion that his future will be decided with the outcome of his attempted murder charges.  So my goal would be to get out of this trial without hurting my chances is the other trial.  And that includes minimizing any opportunity for him to have sworn testimony that could be used to impeach him in the later (and more consequential) attempted murder trial.
And that's not even considering whether the direct would be worth the cross exam.
As for the last part, I'd bet the house on a conviction here.
@_date: 2015-02-18 21:10:03
I think there's plenty of people in the BTC space making a fortune off of naive libertarians.  And all of it comes down to having more perfect knowledge than the other guy.  Like knowing that your exchange isn't solvent and still collecting deposits.  Part of why lawyers exist is because doing things like that is NOT ok!  
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:11:52
In what way would Antonopolous's testimony be relevant?  And I say relevant as a lawyer, not as a layperson.  Meaning his testimony would have to make a material element of this case more or less likely.
And it wouldn't.  That's why he is rightfully not allowed to testify.

Even if there was relevance to the testimony (and I think there would be if it had been for what you outlined), Antonopolous would most certainly not be an expert.
Rather, you'd call a real expert.  This would be a computer scientist who has published research in the field of merkle trees or something.

Actually, it's out of a deep respect for property rights of people that this regulation is necessary.
Right now, exchanges and wallets fold and keep the funds of customers.  So what gives?  You have a contracted exchange of property rights (you can hold my BTC to get some benefit, so I can use your exchange to get some benefit).  Only then there's a problem.  But many exchanges don't respect the property rights contracted to them.  They simply cut and run.
So why doesn't the free market solve this problem by filtering out better services from worse services?  Because a real free market depends on freely flowing accurate information.  And that is not and will not be available from exchanges.  Why?  Because it's cheaper and more profitable to obfuscate and lie.  Especially when there's no incentive (positive or negative) for them to provide freely flowing accurate information.
So, again, the free market has failed to provide a solution, and it is only out of the deepest respect for personal property rights that regulation must be introduced.
I suggest you spend some time read about math, economics, and free markets.  In that order.  I think after learning some very basic stuff, you'll really begin to have a respect for property rights as well.
@_date: 2015-02-23 18:22:20

@_date: 2015-02-07 16:04:30
What right is that?  You're not denied any rights, property or otherwise.
And in the regulatory scheme, the property rights of a company are being traded to protect the property rights of individuals.   That's a good trade in a system where businesses freely do not respect the property rights of individuals. 
Again, read math, economics, free markets.  You'll learn a lot.  Specifically about how important individual property rights are.
