So one was bug in the actual protocol and the other was a bug in just a user created smart contract...  I'm more scared of protocol bugs.

Kind of like how everytime a BMW passes me I think "What a shitty car, because I'm going to have a lambo someday."


The network so terrible that people were doing things my network can't and it prevented other people from doing things my network can't.

Coinbase is fucking expensive.  A fee of 1.5% just to buy coins?  Jesus Christ.
Use another exchange.  I use Gemini and only pay 0.25% on each transaction.  That adds up fast.

Didn't a lot of the hacking tools get lost outside of CIA control though?  The CIA supposedly lost control of a majority of them.
From Wikileaks:
"Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized "zero day" exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive."
The CIA might not give a shit about millions or billions of dollars in hackable bitcoins, but I bet that someone out there does.

It sounds like you actually care about your son, so please don't gamble with his future like this.  200k could really help him a lot and you want to gamble it on the possibility that bitcoin will still be around in 28 years AND still be worth what it is today.  I love bitcoin and all, but tech shit changes a lot in 28 years and that's a huge unnecessary risk to take.
If you want to leave him a few coins that's cool, but I'd put the money in something less exotic.

It's not just the CIA you have to be afraid of, it could be anyone out there.  If someone is willing to give it to wikileaks, don't you think someone is willing to sell it too?

That's true, but unless you've been living under a rock for the last several months- most educated people on this forum know what BU means so you don't have to spell it out.  That fact is pretty obvious from the context of the post as well, so really you're at fault for not just googling it and instead being a dick about it.

Yep... and all the first mover advantage in the world won't keep people paying a $1 transaction fee when they could easily use a different coin and pay a $.01 transaction fee.  Bitcoin dominance will continue to fall.  Bitcoin is supposed to be digital cash, not a slightly cheaper version of money orders.

I wouldn't be surprised if it hit 10k once it starts trading on the CME next month.  Besides, the price went up $2700 in the past 4 weeks... 
 if it keeps up this momentum it could be way over 10k by the end of the year.

That title is the dumbest thing I've read all day... and it has 145 upvotes.  Jesus.  We'll never take over the banks until the bitcoin community has at least a basic understanding of economics and the difference between a commodity and a business.  Fucking hell
@_date: 2017-04-08 16:58:06
The value of a company like visa is based on how much money they take in from fees, while gold is based on how much someone will pay for the next ounce of gold.  You can not compare those market values because they are completely different things based on completely different types of input.  To even attempt to compare them and relate it to bitcoin in anyway is impossible.


That doesn't make sense though.  Bitcoin can be used for payments but in reality it derives its value the same way a commodity does, always has and always will.  To think that you can compare its market cap to a payment processing company shows a huge lack of understanding of how any of this works.
@_date: 2017-04-08 15:06:09
Don't back-peddle...  you put that part of your article in bold and you made it your title because you obviously thought it was a great point to be making.  But it's a silly thing to say and just highlights a fundamental misunderstanding of what drives the value of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-09 10:43:05


None of that matters at all, because it is priced as a commodity.  If all of a sudden I could spend little pieces of gold at a store, or do a bunch of other shit with it, it would still be priced the same way- it is priced at the margin.  


No, because the amount of fees Visa takes in only shows the demand for their service not the underlying value of the money supply they use.  Widespread adoption of payments using bitcoin (even if only held for a short time) would drive demand for the underlying money supply which is much different.


If bitcoin takes over visa, the market value of visa (or something moderately comparable to it) will not move into bitcoin because that market value has no relation whatsoever to the value of the currency they deal in.  They are two completely separate and incomparable things.
@_date: 2017-04-08 15:30:08


No it's not, one is a company and the other is a commodity.  


Yeah.  That's exactly what a lot of us here are saying and it completely goes against what you are trying to imply with your title.

If he has been misrepresented then all he has to do is release the unedited video
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:36:31


He said more than that and you know it.  I don't think it would be hard to prove that he had or should've had a reasonable amount of knowledge that it was a scam but yet he chose to keep making videos day after day with the intention of misleading people.
I think the investors were foolish and deserve to lose their money, however- in cases where people profited off of a scam, they can also be forced to give up their ill-gotten gains.
As for youtube profiting, there is a big difference between selling ad time to a customer and being the person making and paying for the ads.

Youtube is a platform that sells ad time, don't try to defect responsibility.  They don't have time or resources to investigate each customer and make judgement calls on what is or isn't a scam.  If someone drives a car through a crowd of people I don't go blame Toyota for selling the car.

He knew enough to not trade and instead refer.  Also based on his own admissions in this video "It sounds evil but it's not evil"  "You gotta do some 'eh' things to get ahead"  I think it can reasonably be inferred that he (like everyone else as you said) had a reasonable level of knowledge that it was a scam but was just promoting it to get money.
