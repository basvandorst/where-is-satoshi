Duh they are even right now but I don’t want them to loose a lot.
@_date: 2019-08-24 14:57:24
I also understand the ups and downs but I don’t read the market so I don’t know if ppl think it will drop big
@_date: 2019-08-24 15:03:09

I think some people would loss faith in the dollar and in companies and want something more stable that is based off something out of the hands of others.

Getting fiat on to pro takes forever!  I sent money to avoid fees 3 days ago and it’s still pending.  I’d rather eat the fees and play.

Because it evolves shit ton of IP addresses.  I’m well aware of it being two days ago yet I brought it up. Obviously there’s more to it than you understand.

@_date: 2019-06-26 21:36:23
So a whole exchange goes down where people buy every second and now they can’t but that had nothing to do with an unopposed drop.  Then it went back to normal after Coinbase came back

Great video

I don’t think it’s a repost unless there are two funny people on the planet
@_date: 2019-06-01 15:55:15
I agree

When a whole exchange shuts down due to a problem started two days ago, it doesn’t make it the coins fault
@_date: 2019-06-27 06:25:27
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:13:35
Yeah I might have confused myself. I’ll reason out what I was thinking.  So dec 2017. Market cap was  320billion with around 17 million coins and a value of 20k.   Today market cap is 220billion with around 18 million coins and a value of around 11k.  The value is half, but the market value is more than half and we added less than a million coins or so.  I’m not using exact numbers but shouldn’t the market cap be around 186 billion?

There is the 1 million coins that haven’t been touched that he could send. That would prove he is.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:48:12
Ok kiddo
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:52:22
The market cap  for bitcoin right now shows a value higher than when bitcoin was at 20k.  There is more “smart” money invested right now which =Stability.   Today we had whales move while two exchanges were down and we really didn’t drop that much.  I’m going DCA for a bit just to be sure, then but back in big.

Well I just followed recently and haven’t seen it.  That’s the nature of Reddit...the occasional repost.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:41:49
Hopefully it would when it detected one sides transactions.
@_date: 2019-06-27 03:35:41
I don’t know how ����‍♀️
That’s why I is askn the experts.
@_date: 2019-06-04 23:05:50
You’re welcome. Next time I’ll scroll through the whole subreddit when I stumble upon something.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:37:09
Coinbase is part of cloud fare.  They even said this is why.
