Sorry but if you are going to start with questions like this I have to send you to the links on the right panel -------&gt;

ALL bitcoins are "stored" on the Blockchain, always stays there. Wallet is just the form of accessing/moving them.  
If you are dumb enough to use an online wallet (aka banks) that doesn't respect [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( then you are fucked anyway, you have nothing.

But those idiots from EU parliament they miss the whole point.  
Virtual means: non-existent in real world or   
So translating this in our world, actually fiat money are VIRTUAL, those money that those fuckers try to defend so hard.  
Why? Because fiat money are pure virtual, they exist in reality just a small fraction, in form of cash papers and even those are just IOUs.  
On the other side, Bitcoin is NOT virtual, is DIGITAL. But Digital ≠ Virtual all the time.  
For Bitcoin we have a fucking prove that exist every fucking single satoshi, The Blockchain is the open book for proving this existence, even if it is only digital.  
Central banks doesn't have any prove for their fake currency fiat! That is virtual!

Don't make any "review". That will keep you neutral. Making a "review" for such a controversial company puts you in a suspicious position. If you want to have that page very well respected, don't put any votes/reviews/notes/scores for any exchange. All those are more than suspicious.  
Focus on each functionality/feature of exchanges, be neutral with all and let the user to decide. You inform people, not pushing them to a specific place.
@_date: 2017-03-20 11:07:26
What about letting normal people to be able to start mining like long time ago with their CPU/GPU/USB ?  
Bitcoin started like that with few miners, why we can't start with basics again? I am sure there will be many more people now than in 2010-2013 that will join for mining.  
Me myself I still have some GPUs rigs around that I can start them again, for good.

Do whatever your heart and mind is telling you, not what others says.  
After staying outside of this endless debate, my mind and heart told me to activate my 3 Core 0.14 nodes. This is at least I can do in this moment. 
And HODL as I always did.  
Poring gas into the fire will not solve anything but making the situation worse.
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:43:20
Yep, the right question!

Nobody says are on VPS or for what purpose (economic or testing). I said I run 3 full nodes (in/out) to support Segwit &amp; Bitcoin future.

Every day now, I am more convinced that this HF (scaremonger) will NOT come. For more FUD you see, for sure HF will not happen.

Is not about that the review is good or bad. Is about that a review for Coinbase will never be impartial. And in special for a guy with a site that wants to list some exchanges to inform people.  
Making this review on a site that is presenting Coinbase on top of all with an A+ makes more people to ask: "who is this that is "promoting" Coinbase"...  
If you want to stay impartial, don't promote, don't make "reviews".
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:13:53
You missed an important thing in your review: Coinbase was funded by BBVA... Are we still trust the banksters?!  
The review looks more like a nice way to wash their dirty face but their clothes still stinks.  
So makes me wonder, who really is behind "bestbitcoinexchange.io" ?
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:11:45
Why is "problematic", because you will ALWAYS have control of your money?  
Chat system? For what? To accept or not an offer? Useless. You want to buy/sell BTC not talking with people, this is not Yahoo messenger/Telegram  
Reputation? No need, the escrow and fees are protecting anyway the users.  
You are too used to use LB and you can't see other ways to buy/sell BTC.
@_date: 2017-03-20 10:45:49
Yes, I agree with that. Maybe, first, you can explain a bit more each of those answers and then ask people to vote, so they will know what to vote.
@_date: 2017-03-20 10:41:31
Even that I have more knowledge about Bitcoin than average Joe, I couldn't answer to those questions. Behind the answers are lot of technical details that very few knows what really will do for Bitcoin.  
This poll I think is not for everybody. Just clicking those boxes and not knowing exactly what you vote, is like voting NOBODY.  
So I prefer not to vote.
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:01:31
You should read this: 
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:21:52
localbitcoins.com, bitcoin.de or bitsquare.io - P2P exchanges are always the best.

EXACTLY  
Just today a friend of mine, came to me, scared the shit out about all this FUD and price going down.  
He said: I want to sell all my coins, this is going to die bla bla bla etc.  
I said: give me those coins you have go back to your fucking fiat or altcoins or whatever you want.  
He said: Why do you want my coins? Are you crazy? Is going to crush to zero etc...  
I said: I want them because always will be a stupid person to sell them, like you, in panic mode for nothing. Your loss will be my win...  
He start thinking a bit and then... fuck, you are damn right! Nevermind, will stay with my coins.
@_date: 2017-03-21 10:27:24
Yes, so be prepared to dump them for the same amount of BTC, so you can double your BTC :)

@_date: 2017-03-20 11:02:59
Exactly what I said. Messing around just to make noise is not good. But then what is the meaning of this vote?

Those cards are the most stupid thing ever created. Is like putting a horse in front of a car and say you are modernized the way of payments.  
Stop fooling yourself and let be fooled by the banksters! These cards are just another pathetic banksters intent to fool people into using their fiat money.  
Use your BTC wallet when you can or just use fiat if is not possible.

There is no such thing. There are only P2P bank transfer or you mean banks will block also people to make normal bank transfers?
@_date: 2018-06-21 21:36:43


Everything starts with ownership. Once you lose that ownership of "something" you lose all the rest, including your freedom. By just giving away your keys to a bank, you lose the rights of ownership of those BTC.  


LOL seems that you even don't know what is socialism... this generation is really fucked up.
@_date: 2018-06-21 10:33:58
Indians, repeat after me: [Bisq]( is a decentralized P2P exchange that can't be stopped as Bitcoin is a decentralized P2P currency that can't be stopped.

Is not about competition here. Is about respecting people's rights and freedom. That's why Satoshi created Bitcoin.   
[Satoshi's papers]( **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
Bitpay is just VIOLATING the definition of Bitcoin.

I am sure that many Theme WP creators would accept BTC. Did you already choose your WP Theme? Then ask the creator if they accept BTC for the premium version.

 is the way should follow - decentralized P2P exchange for decentralized P2P currency (Bitcoin).  
Any sane person, after reading their philosophy, will really understand why: 
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:09:17


LOL please explain how you hand over your BTC to a bank without losing ownership...  
Please go back to your computer games kid... Next time when you try to explain to somebody what is socialism, please try to live 25 years in socialism. I lived in communism/socialism more than you think and I really know more than you about that shit.

There are no sides. Is just Bitcoin and another intent to take over (aka altcoin). That's it. Any fork of the original chain, if doesn't have the consensus majority will became an ... altcoin. Point and clear, nothing more to discuss.

No, are not. I use Blue wallet and no issues with taking my satoshis from LN and move them wherever I want.  
I see a lot of unreasonable hate lately against this new wallet, but I don't see this the same hate against Coinbase wallet, that is far more than dangerous.  
Seems that "somebody" doesn't like too much concurrency in this matter.

Bisq.network and hodlhodl.com

That's the problem with people: they prefer convenience instead of defending their rights and freedoms.

That's why govs will always abuse people's rights, because they are lazy and dumb.
