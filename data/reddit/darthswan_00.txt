If the miners agree.

I got my email notification back in 2015, it's been there for awhile.

Ahhh yes, the ability to mine your own currency.    
I love mining.  I'll probably never stop...
@_date: 2018-08-25 03:08:22
Several years until the are all mined...?

Not surprising, they know the know participants who manipulate the market....

Interesting replies..
As a former financial planner, I would say it this way....  Be diversified.   
There are two types of diversification: 
Asset Class diversification and Currency diversification.
Stocks, bonds, mutual funds are great asset classes to be diversified into.
Real Tangible assets (precious metals)and cryptos are great for currency diversification.  
Art is a good investment in good times.  
Again BE DIVERSIFIED.

What % is the current monetary system using?

I've been eyeing them for awhile also.  Can't seem to find anyone who has received them.  I've been watching them since they May batch, and no reviews have been done or anything.  I saw a YouTube video or two, but that's about it.

Roubini's take on cryptos, is entertaining.  He's part of a dying regime, and he is trying everything he can, to stay relevant. 
@_date: 2018-10-18 14:26:36
would love to see how they came up with these numbers....

I would like to know how much energy the current financial system uses.  Including the people.

Bad experience with them?

Depends on your cost of electricity.  People who say it isn’t profitable either, have never mined before or have high energy cost.  I’ve been mining since 2013.  It also depends on your personal preference.  I mined at a lose for awhile, in belief of higher prices in the future.  Those 200, 300, 400, 500 days, were rough back in the day.  I look back at it, it paid off.
@_date: 2019-04-18 02:14:46
coming from a miner, unless we see rapid price appreciation, he will not be getting his money back in a year.  Has he done the numbers?
@_date: 2019-04-18 02:35:21
Difficulty is always changing.  I hope he has the latest and greatest machines.  Tell him to triple check his numbers.
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:06:50
I've been mining since 2013 so I've watched the rollercoaster ride.  This seems to happen a year or two after each halving of the block size.  
@_date: 2018-11-21 12:03:20
oh I remember, and still have regrets not getting more @ $150

He's around for pure entertainment.  
@_date: 2018-07-12 11:20:08
i’m mining perfectly fine.   Depends on your cost of electricity..
