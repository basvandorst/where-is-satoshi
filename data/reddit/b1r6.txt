You do realize how much 'crime' is facilitated through the use of the US Dollar (as in physical paper dollars).  It's immense, and thus an invalid point.

After mining in the early days I've been running a 24/7 node for a couple years now.  Nodes are super easy to set up - spin up a VM with the daemon and some disk space and a port-forward later you're good to go!  Even people like me with limited upload capacity and peer counts (~50) capacity could become crucial to the network if under DDOS.  In a way I consider it a civil duty!

Yea, you'll want more than 8 connections so that you are improving connectivity among peers more than the average wallet user.  My first thought is that your configuration file may not have the 'maxconnections' value set to something of your choosing.  I'm not positive, but I think that by default it will only connect to 8 peers (typical wallet needs).
Since we're trying to help out the network, we want to be a net benefit compared to typical wallet peers.  In my case, it is set to maxconnections=50 in the config file, and my daemon starts with the -conf flag to point to that config file so that it knows how many to accept.  If your node has maxed out its allowed connections, online node-checkers like you mentioned will likely say it is not available; this makes sense as it won't exceed the configured peer maximum! More info here: 
Additionally, if you want to avoid choking your home internet connection with the node uploading tons of data, you should be able to rate-limit the upload speed to desired percentage of your maximum upload speed in your VM hypervisor.  Oh, and it's really fun to watch your node at work by running the program iftop.  Over time, it should show TX sum rising higher than RX sum as the node is helping to get wallet peers up to the current block. :)
