Say an afghan girl was magically given 5000 bitcoin and was a bitcoin millionaire. Then what happens? No stores around her take bitcoin, I doubt any stores that take bitcoin online ship to where she is and I can't imagine there is 1 million dollars worth of people around her willing to local bitcoins trade the local money to her. 
What does bitcoin help someone in that situation? Even a lot of bitcoin would be absolutely useless. Is she going to connect her bank account to coinbase or something?

Okay, but why do we need a block chain if you don't even need it for security and security is just fine without it? Was satoshi just a big idiot? Or is it a religious thing where as long as blockchains are somewhere in the equation you don't really need to actually use a blockchain?

Alright, so what was the point of even having a blockchain in the first place? Since we apparently didn't need it for anything?

The solution is to give up on bitcoin as providing any sort of P2P solution and hope something else comes along later that lets you be your own bank.

sounds like bitcoin is a failed product if that is what it requires!

Quick everyone say "cup of coffee! cup of coffee!" and then ignore that people buy things regularly that are hundreds of dollars without having to wait for 10-40 minutes in a store.

Don't worry about lightning networks, they are just today's buzz word, tomorrow it'll be something else, they aren't ever going to be a thing anyone uses.

Why? Those people would have literally the exact same issues. Why would they want bitcoin either? 
@_date: 2015-07-15 23:49:37
Those numbers are crazy, there is certainly not 10 million users. Actually it makes bitcoin look worse if there really was 10 million users since they are all using it so little.

There are many tiny altcoins that pretty much anyone could bring down with a 51% attack, and yet no one does. There is just not a lot of incentive right now for any of it.

"don't use bitcoin", got it!

Remember the good old days when wikipedia didn't accept bitcoin so everyone could complain nonstop how they totally should accept bitcoin and now they do the complaining moved on to how they need to implement a bunch of special snowflake rules for bitcoin? 
This is the exact reason it's not free to accept bitcoin.
