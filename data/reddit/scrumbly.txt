You can leave a pool when it gets too big, but who's to say the new pool you choose isn't colluding with the first (or even outright run by the same operators)?

You don't have to "ensure" success. Even a reasonable probability of success is enough to do nefarious things. Since there's an element of luck in the hashing, it's possible to get away with bad things, at least sometimes, with 50% or even less.

Maybe a dumb question: does the keychain hole mess up the qr code?

It's not that he didn't have any idea he had earned the coins; rather he forgot about them because he last mined quite a while ago and just hadn't followed BC since. He said he thought he'd spent a few hundred dollars in electricity to mine them so I gather he was serious about it when he was doing it. (He also mentioned that he found 3 blocks on his own before switching to the pool so actually 150 of his BC aren't from the pool but from independent mining.)

Good point; I will tell him.

To be clear, the address is the hash of the public key. Sharing the address is, at least theoretically, safer than sharing the public key because an attacker would need to reverse the hash to obtain the public key, the latter being necessary to actually spend the bitcoins. (Of course the private key is also needed for that.)

What about in general though? Are qr codes robust against small errors like this, or is the corner not important, or what. Just curious.
@_date: 2013-03-22 14:36:31
Yeah, that :)

Another difference between simulation and reality is timing. If the price moves on one or more markets before you close the arbitrage that will affect your results. And of course, having released your code, you increase the possibility of this :)

How much time do they wait after an order to confirm the transaction?

Nice project and good for you. Can you share any details about how well it works in practice?
