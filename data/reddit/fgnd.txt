I'm not really nitpicking at what you said, I'm saying that you're spewing out false information. I've personally used bitcoin recently with fees near 100-200 sat/b and been confirmed within 3 hours.

What happens when that protection doesn't work, your account is randomly frozen, then fucked by interest rates, and when you want to resolve it when you're available, they aren't because they don't cater to you.

Sort of, it's downloaded through the google app store and is used as a chrome app, but it's still a dedicated piece of software.

Just a question, what kind of interest would there be for a video guide of how to setup a mainnet lightning node. I finally setup one and if you're anything like me, you hate long walls of texts.
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:43:44
So you're saying that for node operators, the fees aren't a priority because they can barely get the LN working?
And that in the future, when there are more nodes, there will be increased competition for decreased fees to use nodes?

Sorry but what does SPV mean?

Anyone that says transaction fees are at $30-40 and takes days to get confirmed is totally wrong. It's either $30-40 and get confirmed without a few hours, or pay $5 to get confirmed in days.

There are still plenty of desktop wallets that have segwit enabled. I just really hope the electrum team takes this as a message that features need to be secure.

This is what I'm really concerned about. These investors and firms care about one thing, and that's the price of bitcoin. They don't care about the actual use of bitcoin, how additional funding / engineers could help in the creation of new technologies.
I really hope that these investors start investing in companies that works towards the development of cryptocurrencies rather than just holding onto coins.
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:30:55
Wait, I'm still very new to lightning and might have some misconceptions, but I thought that the more direct route you can go will be cheaper. 
So say if Person A pays Person B directly through only one channel, it would be cheaper than Person A paying Person C to use their channel to connect with Person B.
How would adding more nodes decrease fees?

Bither and GreenAddress are the ones that come to my mind instantly.

I agreed with you until the very end. 


The only reason why I use a card is because it's accepted nearly everywhere, but your point is still true. I'd rather have a card where everyone leaves me the fuck alone and it just works, than have "consumer protection"
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:00:09
One question, businesses and people would want their money instantly, which would require the opening and closing of channels everytime a transaction is conducted, so. How would this fix the scalability issues?
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:03:40
Sure but BTC-E hasn’t received millions in VC funding and accepted multiple coins

Not even just that, they've had very little downtime. It seems like coinbase / GDAX is down whenever there is a major price shift.
If I wasn't hodling anymore, I'd definitely be buying from BTC-e.

Is that the network part of the video? So if person A has a channel to person B, and person B has a channel to person C, then you're saying that person A also had a channel to person C? And would this mean that person A's node would communicate directly with person C, or would it community with person C with person B as a "middle-man" that relays information.

You've been saying that I've been warned for over a year now. I just used their cards yesterday and were working a-ok. Out of all the btc &gt; vcc, Wirex is the only one that I use that doesn't require an insane amount of identity verification and has responded to my ticket within 2 business days.

What makes you think I'm keeping all my btc on a webwallet? And not everybody accepts bitcoin, how is adding ONE transaction to literally a payment system of millions transactions going "back to the relation master/slave".
Get your head out of your ass and realize that bitcoin still has a long ways to go and services are like these actually help the network.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:26:43
This argument is completely flawed. Remember BTC-e? It was up for 6+ years, never touched customers money, never was hacked, barely any downtime, it was an ideal exchange that people didn't use because they didn't like its UX.
Just because something hasn't happened before doesn't mean it will.

Setup has been getting easier and easier yes, but you still need to abide by their rules, and some of the ways they get you to pay fees is ludicrous. Banks are at the whim of governments, you don't really control your money the same way you control your money with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:40:11
I hope you realized that GDAX and coinbase are the same thing.
I seriously believe the only reason coinbase is still doing so well is because of their nice UI. If an exchange had the UI of coinbase and the fees of GDAX/Gemini, expect a bunch of people to switch.

Could you explain that to me?
If I remember correctly, I had two channels open. One to blockstream, one to just another random node to test the hops. Closing my random node's channel didn't give me back any funds from closing the channel, but I'm pretty sure blockstream's did.
@_date: 2018-02-15 02:55:52
Not a shill at all, but I closed a lightning channel and received no funds. I gave it about 3 days and then it finally sent my btc back.

Ever since WWII, the US has always had a lot of debt, it's just the way their economy works. But the US' debt isn't necessarily to other countries or investment firms, but a large portion of it is towards the public in the form of bonds.
The way the treasury manages the money is dangerously close to a ponzi scheme. When it's time for the treasury to pay people, they use money from newer bonds that don't need to be paid yet. And just some food for though, the average business cycle lasts 8 years. The last major economic collapse was the 08 housing market

It's just like fiat. Yes fiat is used to buy drugs, but it's such a small amount of the piece of the pie. If all major DN sites went down, sure you could say prices would go down, but it would dip only very minimal.
You seem to think that all the demand of bitcoin is with drugs, I'm here to tell you that if the demand for bitcoin is only drugs, then this cryptocurrency is completely fucked

??? Is that not what the report is saying? 
Because I understand it as: The authors didn't know exact energy use for renewable vs non-renewable, but they can make an educated guess based on a Chinese policy.
@_date: 2018-12-04 20:15:25


of renewable vs non-renewable energy use for
individual mining operations, we can make
educated guesses based on the policy targets for
renewable vs non-renewable use laid out in the
latest Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS)
requirements laid out by the Chinese
government. 
Yes, because Chinese officials are notorious for being super strict and never taking bribes. Though the report does say more and more people are leaving China so that's good.

That being said, this paper definitely changed my mind a bit. But, the paper's inconsistencies and the short life of coinshare makes me a bit skeptical. Even if mining doesn't use true 77% renewable energy, it doesn't seem to be an environmental problem.
