I'm the co-founder of Supload. I can assure you the traffic that user was sending us was all fake pageviews from a botnet. We have to act as quick as possible when this happens or risk losing our advertisers.
@_date: 2017-01-31 17:06:12
Sorry, it's been for protection against bot traffic we've been seeing the last week. All accounts that have been getting that message will be able to withdraw tomorrow on the 1st.
@_date: 2017-01-31 18:18:02
I won't have those stats until tonight when the final analytics run for payouts.
@_date: 2017-01-31 17:43:05
There is none. It's fine. 
@_date: 2016-11-30 01:42:18
Good call. Well, we keep the nsfw off of any public facing pages
@_date: 2016-11-30 05:03:13
That's exactly what we're saying. About time that thing made you some btc.
@_date: 2016-12-30 03:34:24
I also wonder how much of that reaction was caused by some of the publics perception of bitcoin.
The usuals like, bitcoin is a ponzi scheme, it's only used for buying drugs, it has no intrinsic value, etc, etc.
@_date: 2016-11-30 14:30:28
We hope so too. We think it is a great way to get bitcoin into the hands of more people all over the world from doing things that they are already doing on the Internet. 
@_date: 2016-11-30 14:19:55
Thanks, we hope the community enjoys it as much as we enjoyed creating it. 
@_date: 2016-11-30 14:31:06
testing 1..2...3... Thank you for joining us. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 08:52:39
heh, yeah, it'll just take some time. They compare us to an affiliate site because that's all they've seen lately. Youtube is different because it's earned their trust. We'll get there.
@_date: 2016-11-30 05:52:46
No problem. We asked for feedback. Thanks for taking the time. Your points are all valid, but they are problems every website that doesn’t charge credit cards faces.
Cloud computing rentals have plummeted server costs, and the keep getting cheaper. Especially compared to datacenter costs 5+ years ago. 
We don’t have downtown Mountain View, CA office space. We’re two guys working out of our houses in cheap cities, so we can pass those savings onto our users. 
Of course, there will be a lot of low quality content, but that gets handled with a like button, a algo, and a popular page
We think the traffic required to make ads profitable will come from the competitive advantage bitcoin gives us. We can send anyone money, in almost any amount, and that is amazing. You have to have a pretty serious feature set to beat that.
And at the same time, lower the hurdle to first time users getting bitcoin. Which will hopefully help with your hodl investment :)
@_date: 2016-11-30 07:44:26
No, you're earning bitcoin now. The rate we're paying right now is just variable. You'll see your account accruing usd every hour.
We'll know an exact rate we're paying when we compile more data.
@_date: 2016-12-30 03:10:53
Sorry to hear you had a negative experience.
Your posts were of an exceptionally high quality. You put a lot of effort into stitching together long scrolling, classic gaming intro screens. As well as long titles and descriptions about gaming in that era. I looked forward to them.
I'm not sure why people would take up issue with you being rewarded for your hard work. But it would be fine if it was a video hosted on youtube? And the alternative is, your hard work generates income for another image hosting site, and they keep it all.
I guess the idea is new. I hope the general public perception changes.
@_date: 2016-12-27 23:13:13
Our analytics run once an hour. We reward only a few pageviews per ip address in that time. 
@_date: 2016-11-30 22:13:43
You read our mind. That feature is already being written. And look for us to pay sathoshis for social media shares soon.
@_date: 2016-12-28 00:04:15
How have I never seen this? And how did all this happen on a CBS drama?
@_date: 2016-11-30 00:32:46
Definitely, api is in the works
@_date: 2016-12-30 02:05:23
Next button is definitely coming soon
@_date: 2016-11-30 06:08:42
I was just noticing that. Thanks a lot for reaching out. I'll PM you.
@_date: 2016-11-30 01:36:03
Appreciate the feedback. We're a small two man team, IE compatibility fell down the checklist for launch.
@_date: 2016-11-30 06:29:15
No problem. People who come to our site will be served ads. We're not selling any of your content.
You have two options when you upload, a link to our site that earns bitcoin, or a direct link to the jpg/png/mp4/webm/gif, that doesn't earn bitcoin. Whichever you want.
@_date: 2016-11-30 03:49:42
Unfortunately, there are a lot of factors that prevent me from giving you a specific answer, because it’s dependent on the country of the visitors, the specific ads being run, the content of the page, etc.
Once we’re up for a bit and have a few months of steady traffic coming in, we will be able to give out specific rates. But for now we’re doing a profit-sharing model.
@_date: 2016-11-30 00:40:14
Is it open source? Can I get in touch with the dev when we get the api running?
@_date: 2016-11-30 00:16:01
heh, it's not spam. Just meme and gif hosting.
@_date: 2016-11-30 14:18:27
Appreciate it, thank you! 
@_date: 2016-11-30 14:22:23
Definitely yes, that is in the works and coming real soon.
@_date: 2016-12-03 21:13:21
ok, I can make an option to make that amount hidden. I was just putting it there for marketing purposes really.
And yeah, a link to the full size image is really easy to do. I'll get it done.
@_date: 2016-11-30 00:19:35
Thanks for the input. We think the same thing :)
@_date: 2016-12-01 16:29:59
I've got a partner that I'm working with
@_date: 2016-12-30 02:55:40
Great. Thank you.
@_date: 2016-11-30 14:24:32
High five! Great success! Thanks :)
@_date: 2016-11-30 06:02:20
Sorry, not at this time. We're focusing on the open web for now.
@_date: 2016-11-30 20:05:41
Definitely. We'll be launching a satoshis for referring a friend program soon.
@_date: 2016-12-30 02:26:31
Sorry, it's not us. We had an article run on bitcoin.com, and it's generating a lot of posts. We're surprised by it as well.
@_date: 2016-12-27 18:14:37
haha, relevant username. Have you tried uploading your hairy arse? Maybe it's just what the internet is looking for.
@_date: 2016-11-30 14:23:33
Thank you for the feedback. You're right that it is confusing and could be worded better. We will adjust this soon.
@_date: 2016-12-04 06:51:14
I just sent your a pm about another subject.
But for the views, it's most likely a ad blocker problem. Our view counter increments for every view. But we can only credit payment if the ad gets viewed. 
@_date: 2016-11-30 02:44:09
We’re only going to work with largest, most reputable ad networks. We’ll only use ad networks that pre screen 100% of the ads they display. And they will never exceed “pg-13” levels on non-nsfw pages.
A virus infested ad is only going to hurt our business and what we’re trying to do here. We’re trying to become one of the easiest places for people to obtain bitcoin, old and new btc users alike.
@_date: 2016-11-30 00:56:50
For those of you who are Reddit Enhancement Suite fans, our pull request for inline image viewing just got merged into the newest pre-release version.
@_date: 2016-12-03 20:54:29
Well, you can make your account private on the profile page. That will hide the btc amount. Is there a particular reason? I can definitely add that in as a feature, to just hide that amount.
You mean like a zoom feature? Click on the image and make it full browser width? That is definitely doable.
@_date: 2016-12-30 02:12:46
Yeah, native apps aren't on our radar right now. We're still a small 2 man team. But we're working on an api right now, which would make building a native app significantly easier. Hopefully soon.
@_date: 2016-11-30 19:21:14
Thank you!
@_date: 2016-12-30 03:46:27
We've seen the ad blocker ratio vary from sub to sub. not so much. most do.
We can't reward for RES loads. We made the decision to be compatible with res to please the hardcore reddit user. As a new image hosting service, a lot of subs won't allow us because we're not imgur. We thought the potential of our users being able to reach a larger audience in the larger subs was worth the tradeoff of losing the views from the few with res installed.
@_date: 2016-12-30 01:54:10
That's a great idea. We're going to implement tipping soon. But I never thought of a payment to remove ads and give to uploaders of the images you browse.
@_date: 2016-12-02 01:06:09
Thanks. We had a problem with a misconfigured nginx server. Should be fixed now.
@_date: 2016-12-30 03:11:45
No, sorry. We can't reward bitcoin unless the ads load. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 07:23:20
I tried to make that copy as small as possible. To help kickstart the idea/site. I'm by no means married to it. If that is the roadblock, it's gone.
I don't like his point of "Aside from big YouTubers, not many people are making money off it." 
There is nothing stopping you from becoming a "big youtuber". People are making life changing amounts of money from youtube. 
The internet has dropped the barrier of entry to this to simply owning a smart phone, regardless of race, location, economic class, etc. 
Bitcoin has enabled a garage startup to offer these same opportunities without funding, hr department, offices, etc. We are not going to be the last to do this, the innovation is just starting.

I haven't looked at his account in awhile. I almost broke the scroll wheel on my mouse trying to look at his trophy case.

DJ Putin'it down
@_date: 2016-12-27 17:16:49
Thank you
@_date: 2012-11-05 21:10:13
Good question. I'll add it to the faq. We only log for debugging. Tor connections are fine.
@_date: 2012-11-05 21:25:43
Nice. Thanks.
@_date: 2012-11-05 23:03:44
We comply with any DMCA takedown requests. Block accounts is in the works. Should be available soon.
@_date: 2012-11-05 19:14:42
Full disclosure. I'm the owner if anybody has any questions.
@_date: 2012-11-05 21:23:50
log files are never kept &gt; 2 weeks
@_date: 2012-11-05 22:02:31
No, there is a pretty big bandwidth cost for the server. Download speeds hit the multiple MB/s. The BTC price seems to be holding somewhat steady in the $10 - $11 range, which covers expenses. I'll adjust the price of the service for any big BTC price jumps.
@_date: 2012-11-05 22:03:09
I just answered above.
@_date: 2016-09-23 20:27:34
I love that show. What is the bitcoin logo doing in the background?
@_date: 2016-09-24 03:02:42
My life goals are now re-arranged to Gym, Tanning, Buying bitcoin. You've shown me the light.
