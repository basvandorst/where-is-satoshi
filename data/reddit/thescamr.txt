The Fed is a private peak on the pyramid of public banking set to regulate the money supply with dual goals of having beneficial impacts on inflation and employment.
They are the lender of last resort for troubled banks and work in helping checks clears from various separate banks.  Using various tools they control the size of the money supply.
What is so hard to understand?

The US reliance on debt is a problem, but the blame lays with the Congress, which refuses to raise the money it tells the executive branch to spend.
And answer me clearly, what are the economic and social ills of deflation.  Do some reading if you need to.  Cite wikipeida if need be.  Work on your edification.

Deflation is bad for ***any*** debt holders.  If you own a car, student loan, house, any debt.  Basically it is bad for 90% of the population.  The unwillingness to take on debt wrecks havoc on the economy and it is acerbated by the fact that consumers, knowing prices will drop, stop buying goods and services.  This cascades through the economy driving the downturn into a more severe spiral.  Companies lay off staff and unemployment goes up.
How much thought have you really thought to not targeting inflation?  Are you really opposed to loaning money responsibly?

The problem is if people see too much of what the Fed is doing it resorts in huge amounts of speculation.  Many members of the Fed adopt [Fed Speak]( vague/ambiguous statements designed intentionally to not excite or scare the market.


[Another main complaint is the Fed buys its Treasuries from the open market and not directly from the Treasury.](  This puts big banks in between as middlemen able to make what looks to be "free money".  The Fed defends this practice, which is required by law, to keep them independent from the Executive Branch, which controls the Treasury.

Do you want the Fed to not attempt to set inflation goals?  Do you know why we target inflation and not deflation?  Do you really believe that the Fed is free from oversight when their chair and board members can be subpoena to testify before Congress?
Supporting the Fed, or other central banks, is different than supporting other cartels due to the vital service the Fed provides.

Lets be serious, when it comes to bank bail outs how many have been facilitated BIS?  Especially in the United States, considering OP comment was a jab at the US Fed?

dear fucking god.  There are so many ways to hedge yourself against changes in the price of money.  And the Fed has an explicit goal of moderate inflation, so you know generally what they are going to be doing with the value of money.
