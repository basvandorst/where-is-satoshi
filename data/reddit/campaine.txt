I don't think that's true. The intrinsic value of bitcoin is the total cost of electricity used to run it. Bitcoin is most likely the one being mined the most at the moment, so it's worth more.

Supply and demand. Supply and demand is not directly correlated to inflation. You are implying that because you charge more, the same amount of people will still purchase your product. Elasticity is in full effect here. You don't just get to charge more because you can. You charge more because you think the elasticity is low enough where people enough people will still buy at the new price to generate more revenue. If the demand of the product increase, but basic goods don't just go up just because they can. Without calculating the elasticity, you will lose revenue and likely investments. Where are you getting the idea prices go up just because they can?

That's not inflation if BTC was the standard instead of dollars. We're talking about inflation in equivalence to BTC not the dollar.

I just bought my first few bitcoins in my life. I bought 10 because I see some promise despite all the "bitcoin is dead" naysayers. I haven't seen a reasonable argument as to why it is dead, so I'm glad I bought into it. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 19:11:12
The point is BTC to product is not inflationary as the price of the dollar would adjust. It's not a question if the dollar will inflate (which it will), it's a question if the bitcoin price will inflate assuming little to no volatility directly bitcoin related. In that case, Bitcoin will not inflate. The dollar will, and the BTC to dollar value will increase, but the BTC to product will not. Therefore bitcoin does not inflate. You cannot inflate something if it doesn't go into production. The reason currencies inflate is because a centralized org can produce more. If it wasn't getting printed, the value wouldn't be inflating. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 20:07:44
So is bitcoin valued as a currency or an asset?
@_date: 2015-01-30 21:49:29
You're going to need to link me a source where the CPI as a whole outpaced inflation just because (not something because of natural disasters or wars). If it's only some, then it's simple substitution. The market isn't inflating, just a certain good. Inflation is entirely based by the consumer price index. All the goods cannot inflate if there is no more money to increase the prices by. Everything is a substitution of weight within the CPI. 0% net inflation, but sure some goods can go up and others will go down.

Price correction on a bullish market sparked from a rumor found true. Growth is still very likely. Growth isn't always a consistent positive correlation.

Is this what you're referring to?
@_date: 2015-01-30 09:22:45
That is true, but when a currency no longer inflates, demand for the currency will constantly increase as well. It really depends on the derived inflation in comparison to buying power of the currency. If they charge the same but the buying power of the currency goes up, they are meeting the derived inflation. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 21:01:12
But what does this have to do with bitcoin? 
@_date: 2015-01-17 00:36:43
With 15% of the mobile market share and even significantly less in critical regions like Asia, this means all of nothing. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 15:59:48


That's not what inflation is. If you're currency is inflating, the prices for items goes up in comparison to the currency. You can argue that the value of the currency goes down since there is more of it as well. If you don't produce more bitcoins, you will need less as the price goes up. Example: if something costs 1000 usd today and 1010 next year, that's 1% inflation. If bitcoins are worth 1000 USD but is worth 1010 next year, the buying power has increased by 1%. Even though the value of the item inflated in comparison to the dollar, bitcoin stayed the same because bitcoins can't be produced past a certain point. It will more than likely beat inflation since there can only be so many coins.

Someone involved in bitcoins should know better when it's a market failure instead of a failure by vendors and buyers. Besides, evolution isn't the only darknet market out there in the first place.

Why does everyone come up with some conspiracy about why the price of bitcoin dropped when the answer is obvious. Evolution exit scam led to a massive coin dump. The demand can't keep up with the supply, so the price crashed. There isn't some price manipulation going on. At least do your homework before coming up with a silly theory with no evidence. Your feels won't convince anyone.

It's still extremely unethical to sell massive debt knowing the fundamental bulk will fail.

The bots are there to trade on margins and split a profit just like the bots trading on the NASDAQ. There is no motive for market manipulation. We have witnessed the price of bitcoin go from just a few dollars to over a grand and currently sit at 250~. To have the value drop like 20% is seriously not that ridiculous. We've quite a few currencies change prices that dramatically just this year. I just don't possibly see the motive for manipulation when the culprit is quite obvious.

Can bitcoin even sustain at that price considering overhead costs of mining? 
@_date: 2015-02-25 10:17:44
It may work as well, but both consumer and merchant confidence in the currency will deplete greatly if the price dropped down to $.25. With such a finite supply, that would mean the entire market value would be a couple of million. That's not even worth considering as payment. The price does matter. The price is indicative of confidence in bitcoin as an object of value. If it has no value, it's not important. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 19:29:12
Agreed. It terms of tech revolutions, it's very rare where only a moderate upgrade bests the original vanguard. When the push from cd/dvd was going towards HD dvd, most didn't think blu ray would be adopted, but companies found more practicality with it to make it worth the transition. The next altcoin would have to be fantastic in not only features but also user base adoption. If this happens, we would all see it happen. No one would be surprised.

Not the worst decisions I suppose, but it could have been better. The market may not have finished adjusting for good news do there was some opportunity to get a better price point.
