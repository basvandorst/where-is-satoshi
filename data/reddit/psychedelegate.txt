Can we get a tk;dr? “Too Korean; Didn’t Read”

Omg fucking gold. I love the art piece but this is just hilarious. You deserve Reddit Gold and Bitcoin Gold.

Thank you for showing us this! I found it very fun to understand!

Large and crypto-USD

And me as well, my fellow meatsacks!

The article mentions that Bitcoin is unseizable. [Bitcoin can be and has been seized.](

When I click "Biz Info" I do not see "Additional Information"

Also if he had kept his 10% share, Apple wouldn’t have grown anywhere near as large, because he clearly didn’t believe in the Apple vision.

Curious how the economics of that play out
@_date: 2017-09-12 07:08:57
People can be so naive, entitled, and conspiratorial. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:04:00
Yes. I can edit my business info etc from the app. 
The only fields showing are:
Service area
Meet the owner
Mark as closed
There is no "Additional Information" category.

Weird. It's not there. iPhone 6, Yelp for Business app fully updated.

�� Iiiiit’s a complicated coin, and no one understands it’ll replace money, *Bit-coin*
@_date: 2017-09-12 15:32:28
Thank you for your sympathy, but I live in America. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 06:27:39
I'm on the yelp for business owners iphone app and do not see the section you are taking about. What is the exact menu sequence?
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:13:54
Yea. Ppl need to take their tinfoil hats off. The US Govt isn't some evil entity ruled by a reptilian cabal. They really are trying to do their best to look out for us.
@_date: 2017-10-07 21:16:28
And no one “bet on the internet”.
They bet on internet startups.

Try living in a 3rd world country and then tell me that. You sound very entitled and naive. If you don't like it, run for office and stop being a condescending armchair cynic benefitting from the system you seem to hypocritically hate. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 02:47:55
I'm in the USA and I've never seen this function.

*worthless fiat*
Oh come on. Burn your "worthless fiat" if you don't want it.

San Francisco, iPhone app.

Economics and politics are intimately related but two very different things. But let's pretend the US is a mega corporation. Is business evil? When you earn your wage, are you doing evil deeds? Probably not. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 15:36:01
*Governments tend to tyranny*
You stopped thinking after you read 1984 in middle school. When's the last time "the government" came knocking on your door and told you to do something? Anything.
You completely missed the point about living in the 3rd world. Only spoiled 1st world people talk shit about the 1st world. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 16:39:42
Do you think you shouldn't have to pay taxes because the govt is just a bunch of corrupt thieves?
@_date: 2017-10-09 00:00:06
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:50:12
Super weird. Thanks!

We should always strive for improvement and social justice (without being an SJW).
But let's see this better system you're talking about. If it was as simple as that, it would already be here because people would have made it happen.
