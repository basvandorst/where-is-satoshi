So I decided to start saving for a bitcoin miner...has to be bought with bitcoin cash if buying from bitmain... so yesterday I deposited 250$ to coinbase went through just fine on mobile app.... woke up today to 180$ and selling is blocked... can't cut losses... not that I want to ... just cant... in fact now I'm stuck until hopefully I can get as close to 250 as possible so I can sell... loose on fees and save bitcoin... then shapeshift when I have 1800.... I have cld storage that I'm not touching till 2020... lesson learned....looks like this is going to hurt....

I'd be more worried about litecoin ... don't know why you need so many micro payment options ...I hate to say it but it looks like litecoin got side swiped

Yup the next week will be interesting

I think right now things like lightning network and lite coin make bch obsolete in the majorities vision... bitcoin cash seems to want to fight for a position where lite coin assumes it's position....we shall see ... this pimple will come to a head..   I think it's lite coin and I own 0...

There are fees for moving bitcoin ...this is basically what everyone is fighting about...scaling.... ledgers are great however if you are trading regularly I would just keep it on exchange...again just my $0.02..
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:15:06
I keep small amounts on gdax and most in ledger..

Why not LN AND SEGWIT2X?

But "Internet banks" still have much cheaper operating cost than brick and mortar...plus bitcoin really can be much more than a bank...w salt..and other future developments 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:38:35
I think everyone should be more worried about litecoin as its bch biggest competition....it would take decades to unwrite bitcoin as the true bitcoin...just my opinion  
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:55:09
Seriously just get to watch bch go up 300% on coinbase... worried about btc
