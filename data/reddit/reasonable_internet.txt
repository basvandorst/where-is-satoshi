With bitcoin you can experience a lifetime's worth of inflation in just a few years!

Modern accounting standards, such as International Financial Reporting Standards or Generally Accepted Accounting Principals of the United States would require you to record your bitcoins at their fair value based on prices quoted in active markets. This would include recording a paper loss either through the income statement or other comprehensive income.

Invest that money conservatively. Your goal should be to build yourself to a level of wealth where your savings adds considerably to your earning power. That is to say, you one day own a home which saves you from paying $XX,000 in rent every year, or you own shares in a company with durable earning power that consistently pays you dividends at a rate of say, %5. The idea that just because you're young and have little saved makes speculative risks somehow more palatable is foolish. What you save today has the maximum amount of time available to compound before you retire and begin reaching for your savings. To quote the master, "Investment is an operation which ensures safety of principal and the reasonable expectation of an adequate rate of return" - Ben Graham. Operations which do not meet this criteria are speculative, and carry with them the risk of total loss. You are correct that %3 on 10K is nothing, after 40 years it amounts to a mere $32,600. Try the calculation again, only this time add $10K per year to your principal, again at the low rate of return of %3. After 40 years your savings have grown to $787,800, possibly enough to retire on and likely more than many of those in your generation will have available. You might be surprised at how low that figure is, but it should underscore the importance of consistent savings starting at an early age, rather than lead to the conclusion that its hopeless and that you should be taking your money to the roulette wheel.

Didn't see a single CPA on that entire list. Might have missed it though.

Your are welcome to read the past financial results of the company, and research the industry in which it operates to try to assess its ability to pay dividends in the future.

You sound like an animal spirits type. Speculators are the reason that bitcoin is as expensive as it is, the actual volume of transactions for goods and service make up a small fraction of the total demand for the coins (don't ask me what fraction, detailed analysis isn't going to change the conclusion here.) When the greed turns to fear the race to get in becomes the race to get out. I'll level with you, Tester, I subscribed to this sub for the shadenfreude I knew I would experience when the pendulum swung the other way. It's worked like a charm so far but there is much yet in store. The best thing you can do for yourself financially is to sell whatever inventory of bitcoins you have, except those you need for day to day purchases you make with bitcoin. Extrapolating this logic is the reason why ultimately a steep decline in the price is inevitable, even if Bitcoin does end up becoming a common method of payment for online transactions.

This reminds me of a thought I've had lately. A bank could issue their own crypto currency (though I doubt they would call it that).
The bank would run the servers and infrastructure that would allow people to transfer their issued coins between people, thus no decentralized mining. The bank would also peg the value of their coins to a fixed number of dollars eliminating exchange rate fluctuations. 
This would allow users to treat the issued "coins" like money orders, and to transfer money around the world nearly instantaneously. Users would buy coins from the bank, transfer them when needed, and recipients would redeem them for currency. The system could be designed to operate very quickly with very low risks and no exchange fees. 
-Advantages to users: No exchange rate fluctuations, and the system would be overseen by an established and regulated institution. 
-Advantages to the bank: People trading fiat currency for the issued coins would create a float, a revolving fund of money that could be treated like other bank deposits. A portion of which the bank could then loan out and earn a return on. 
Overall thoughts: At the moment it probably doesn't make sense for a bank to do this because the costs of establishing the system would not be justified by the size of the float that would be created. 
Also, the bank that did this might have compliance problems regarding money laundering or other regulations.

It troubles me that people who live far better than at any point in history, with the most significant advances coming most recently, would become so disheartened by the relatively minor problems out civilization faces that they would prefer the abyss of anarchy, from which our civilization painstakingly emerged, rather than to try to treat the problems we face and keep in tact the profound benefits we've achieved.

The ETF will need to issue a prospectus prior to being traded on an exchange.

It works out to 3273.5%/year. I know tons of investments returning that much and more! PM me!

Most banks are public companies which require them to make a number of disclosures such as GAAP compliant financial statements which have been audited by an independent auditor, management discussions and analysis, annual information forms and others.

I strongly advise not equating bitcoin to the market capitalization of businesses.
Business valuations: Businesses are valuated based on the amount of cash which they are expected to earn for their owner(s) in the future. For example, if a business produced $1million cash after taxes each year with relative consistency, you might expect its value to be $10-15million. This would correspond to a rate of return of 10%-6.7% per annum. 
A currency is not comparable to the valuation of a company. If you owned all of Discover, last year you would have made $2.4billion according to its audited annual report. If you owned every bitcoin during that year your earnings would have been zero. Additionally, since no one else would have any bitcoins, there would be no one to transact with and widespread bitcoin adoption would presumably have been a failure.
I would suggest that transaction volume and the number of unique bitcoin users would be better ways of evaluating the value and progress of bitcoin than by multiplying the number of coins in circulation by their present exchange rate. I do not believe that comparing the "market capitalization" of bitcoin to that of active businesses is meaningful.

It is genuinely a bizarre situation. Some institutions are required to hold government treasuries as a certain percentage of their portfolio so they have no choice but to buy at negative yields. As for the others I don't know why anyone would want to lend at a negative rate, unless perhaps you believed the rate would become more negative in the future.

Lower interest rates make it easier for debtors to afford their interest payments. Negative rates even more so. Lower interest rates imply higher prices paid for debt instruments, implying more confidence on the part of buyers. Negative rates even more so. This article makes no sense.
