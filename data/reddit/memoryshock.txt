He's right...it's a debate topic; not an assertion by the textbook.
Good topic too...I could debate the hell out of that one...

How about no?

Could someone explain what difference there is to side chains with regards to the Blocknet proposed by the developer of XC? XC is an alt coin and Blocknet is a system that will allow multiple alt coins to use each other's features...

And this is why I love the altcoin community...:)

The article is pointless...but according to the other post here the atm is about three hours from me.  So the article itself sucks but reddit pulls through and helps me not only find the information I was interested in but shows me how to find it in the future...;)
I'm thinking of making a trip to check it out...:D

Dogecoin is an interesting phenomenon...it is the most traded cryptocurrency  - more than all other combined.  And it is purely for the fun of it.  Very relevant to note in my opinion...

I can't find any foocoin anywhere...where do I find it?
@_date: 2014-04-17 01:25:04
No.  Maidsafe is a Scottish company that is building a decentralized internet and their cryptocoin is called Safecoin.  The fundraiser starts on Tuesday where you have the option to purchase at a rate of 7,000 safecoins for one Bitcoin.  The actual safecoin won't be launched until the genesis block is which will be Q4 2014.
They are a Bitcoin 2.0 company...this could go either way.  Could be huge, could be mild.  Not sure where I want to go with this because discussion is lite all around after the sidechains announcement...
@_date: 2014-09-22 07:02:18

To be quite Frank...when ank of Bamerica released their report that ~$1300 was a fair valuation of bitcoin, bitcoin never went beyond that.
I remember reading it when it was released.

Will be decided by the market but the fundraiser is giving 7,000 safecoins per 1 BTC...
