You could say that, it just feels like the simulation is beginning to show itself or there is something bigger about to happen. It just feels very odd...

The panic is starting to subside, the selling is starting to slow down. Numbers were flying left and right over the past hour, looked like Christmas colors in front of your face

It's funny to see everyone's comments today compared to the past few days where it seems like everyone was panicking and lost all hope today because there was a loss for the day, and now that it is going back up everyone will start to freak out and say only good things. Seems to be that a lot people are not used to this price action that was previously here a couple years ago. Idk, people need to chil land realize that there will be lows and highs. Just need self control and realize where we are in this run. Rant sponspored by Labatt's Blue

I think he means the opposite of crash in this context but is very contradicting with the statements lol
@_date: 2019-05-02 19:35:55
Due to the democrats behavior and rediculous policies, Trump has the guarnteed win so he will be the man to show support

Sheeeeet, you got me. But, if they see the USD price is in that range they could still consider it lucky? Just a thought, ill go in my corner now

So I use Coinbase to check the prices of BTC and almost every day the app unfollows BTC so I have to refollow BTC? Anyone else have this issue?

If we just get to the 8k range the Chinese are going to buy the hell out of those numbers. Reason? 
"No. 8 has long been regarded as the luckiest number in Chinese culture. With pronunciation of 'Ba' in Chinese, no. 8 sounds similar to the word 'Fa', which means to make a fortune. It contains meanings of prosperity, success and high social status too, so all business men favor it very much"

Same could same for you. Illegitimate? Haha explain yourself

Week old reddit acct says he put 100k in and pulling out, dont fall for this!

If you knew anything about the electoral system of the United States, the popular vote doesn't decide the winner, the electoral college does. Second of all, the Russians did try to to steer the election, under Obamas administration, not Trump's. If you read the Mueller report you will find that Trump had been cleared of any crimes, sure he may not be the best person but did not commit a crime. You sound like a broken record spun by the mass media and will not admit defeat. Youre still trying to win the 16 election while we are ready for 20. Im sorry, but youre going to have to deal with 2 terms of him because of rhetoric such as your own

So weird to think last time there was this much volatility and upswings was 2 years ago, feels like yesterday. I totally didnt have any care for all this in 2018 and a couple months ago i got the urge to come back to it, and here we are

Its not even time when the bulls come out to play, just wait a couple hours, holy shit we are going to hit 8k by midnight

Get ready for the heinous rip to the upside
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:53:49
Wohhoo! Buckle in boys! Talk about adrenaline! you want in, nows your chance! If you didnt expect a pullback at all during this period you were sadly mistaken
