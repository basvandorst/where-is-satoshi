Hope we'll celebrate $20,000 in a few months again.

Such things make me realize that there are still lots of steps bitcoin needs to take before being effortlessly used for everyday purposes. It's sad.
@_date: 2018-09-04 09:02:00
 Yeah, fiats it's usual national money, like USD, EUR, GBP, etc. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 15:07:03
 Are you sure you checked on the Internet? :)  
@_date: 2018-09-17 08:32:44
 You could use CEX if you want to buy with debit/credit cards. They also have a bank transfer option which is even faster and requires no fees. Check the relaunched wire transfer: r/ 
@_date: 2018-09-28 14:07:50
 At CEX both short and long trades are available: r/ It's available in the USA but some of the states could be restricted, unfortunately. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 12:30:20
 Oh, man. We all now live in a world of technology, and it's a common practice. Don't be afraid, nobody is gonna hurt your dignity :)

Nice going, brother holder) It’s great that you haven’t sold your btc, it means that you still believe that it’s price may go to the moon again. I understand that you won’t hodl forever, but I hope that you’re not going to sell it any time soon. So… If you want to sell bitcoin for usd ( r/ ), I’d recommend you to do it on cex. For me this exchange seems to be the most convenient one. Actually, there is one unpleasant remark — if I’m not mistaken they operate in the USA, but not in each state. But I guess that it won't be a problem for you to recheck this info. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:47:35
OMG... Am I the only one who feels sorry for this guy more than for bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-09-19 13:25:42
 Try CEX then. There you can obtain bitcoins using your cards with fees now lowered to 2,99%. Besides, it might interest you that wire transfers options have been recently updated: r/ 
@_date: 2018-08-28 13:57:21
 Maybe, you could try to work with cex? They support buying cryptos with cards or withdrawing assets to them (just like coinbase does). Actually, bank transfer might turn out to be even faster payment method. BTW, the company relaunched this and other payment options - r/ 
@_date: 2018-08-21 15:25:48
 Despite the fact that is meal turn out to be really expensive, I think that it’s a good thing! If Bitcoin is a digital money, why don’t we use it as money? After all, even if our strategy is to hold the main part of our btc, it doesn’t mean that we can’t use it as a payment method at all.

 I've never watched this movie, but I'll definitely watch it on weekend! p.s. The more I look at this gif the more perplexed I get about my understanding Bitcoin... 
@_date: 2018-05-30 12:33:43
Well... yeah, these exchanges are pretty good, but still... why did they drop [poloniex]( [cex ]( As for me, they also good. Polo has a great variety of cryptos, cex slightly loses here, but it's rather simple in use and has nice options. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 08:35:07
 Everything in the modern world is based on technology. What now is a common practice, was once considered insane. The meaing of "tradition" has massively changed. New traditions replace the old ones all the time. Crypto doesn't have to function like a so-called traditional currency, it has its own rules and its own purpose. 
@_date: 2018-10-09 10:29:51
 Though I've used not so many exchanges I can say that they all promise “fast and immediate transactions”. But in fact, not all of them offer that. The speed of transactions will depend on your target currency, Internet connection, and many other things. Using a bank transfer option would more or less fasten the process. For example, CEX has that option renewed: r/ 
@_date: 2018-10-02 12:04:26
 Well, what should the exchange have to satisfy you? A pure curiosity. 
@_date: 2018-10-18 11:29:51
 If you don't mind middlemen, that's great :) I know one good alternative to aforementioned Coinbase – CEX (r/ You can easily buy, sell, and trade there. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:07:19
Well, I just need a time machine for getting back in 2009. Does anybody have it?
@_date: 2018-11-29 13:47:23
 Another small step to bitcoin mass adoption. A real-world usage is very encouraging. But as for now, bitcoin infrastructure is insufficient and there are issues, like the one with scalability, that need to be solved. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 11:02:55
 If you don’t know how to trade, better leave them in the wallet. Trading requires knowledge and experience. That are no easy ways become a millionaire with crypto. What you can do is just educate yourself on the subject more and more.

 BCH is a fork with some improvements of the network. BCH cannot gain such great popularity and recognition as BTC has now. Actually, no crypto is able to compete with BTC in terms of popularity, reliability, market capitalization, and price. But BCH actually represents some important advancements. We'll see how it will succeed in the future. 
@_date: 2018-11-05 14:59:12
 There was no better store of value than gold till bitcoin appeared. Bitcoin is much easier to transfer and store. The world’s tendency towards digitalization helps a new generation make choice in favor of bitcoin. But we are too far from it, it will take a lot of time. Bitcoin can also become the world reserve currency. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 11:02:09
 After bitcoin reached its peak of $20k, it became more speculated. Not only the news from the governments create FUD but crypto whales with tons of money manipulate the market for their own good. People with lack of knowledge about crypto tend to panic and sell bitcoins that play into hands of the manipulators. We should learn to distinguish actual facts from the buzz and control our emotions. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 15:44:18
 You can buy Bitcoin with a small amount on CEX – this exchange supports cards and also has an option of wire transfers  with zero fees. This is probably the best choice for making a deposit with a small amount of euro.  
@_date: 2018-03-13 10:14:09
A great video of a current stage manipultions with cryptos.
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:11:48
I totally agree with you. Tech talks whatever interesting they can be,
are not able to make such an unbelievable promotion to the idea of cryptos as decentralized 
currencies, an innovative alternative financial instrument better than the hype round Bitcoin
has already done and will do more. It's not only about greed, the Bitcoin value can be added
by public popularity. Thus, the more news round "magical money", the more people can 
know, study and, perhaps, adopt for their realities usually too far from the cryptoworld.
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:00:52
Exactly what I feel about it. The post was worth reading and 
pondering over, thank you.
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:16:26
AOL's succeeded in nineties because it was a pioneer internet company
that time, the same as cryptos and the whole blockchain stuff is now. The guy in the above
 post must have made a fortune believing in something and dealing with something brand 
new and unfamiliar. As you and me are doing now, being a part of a community. 
I guess this was the message. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 10:17:34
I have been using cex and kraken. Both are quite good and fit the needs of an inexperienced trader like me.
@_date: 2018-02-20 14:48:32
the best doctrine ever or ...
@_date: 2018-07-09 08:55:22
 Well, paxful looks not bad. But personally I still prefer using cryptocurrency websites. For example, like [cex ]( but there are more sites like this one. But mainly I buy btc there with the credit card, btw fees for that is quite low. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 15:42:54
 You can try one of those websites that you mentioned. Or try something new. Anyway, you’ll need to do another deep research before making final decision. To compare you can try [cex ]( The truth is it holds not as many coins as Kraken, but it's a great place for people, who have troubles with finding an exchange that supports their country. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 16:01:32
 It reminds me of Big Brother, as well as Goldstein from Orwell's '1984'. Nobody knows if they are real, but people keep talking about them and even stating about having seen them. Don't you find it suspiciously similar to that of our reality? 
@_date: 2018-07-06 13:07:09
 Here is a piece [cnet-explainer]( Also, there is great and immortal [Wikipedia ]( Probably, this site is not the one you may totally rely on, but I find it really useful and informative. 
Anyway, it’s better to make a comparison of info from different sources each time you learning something. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 11:00:26
 This is the calm before the storm. Pretty sure that Bitcoins price will rise again soon. 
@_date: 2018-07-10 14:41:21
 You mean privately? I know it's possible to buy btc with cash, ATM, online or through the decentralized exchange. Here's some info about that -  
@_date: 2018-07-02 09:28:36
 As usual, I would recommend using hardware wallets :) They are safer, but  though could be rather expensive. But safety worth it. 
@_date: 2018-07-13 13:55:42
 Well, I think that author meant that altcoins are dependening on Bitcoin. It's still a big boss :) At the same time I can’t disagree that analogy isn't as direct as we expect it to be in meme. There are numerous of quite promising altcoins. Besides, btc’s price is also deep now. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 11:41:18
I wouldn't call that 'tip of the day', but still quite a good idea I think. And what you offer to do is kinda marketing strategy. Not bad, IMO.
@_date: 2018-12-05 12:19:50
 Try cex. In addition to website, it has an app. Both versions are user-friendly and intuitive. The fee for credit or debit card deposit is 3.5%. Moreover, you can make a deposit via wire transfer with no commission that is awesome, imo. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 10:23:55
Agree. Actually, I don't understand the reasons to sadden. Bitcoin gives such great opportunities to all of us — both traders and investors. And I think it's great when the times of bull and bear markets go one after another. If we would have only one of them, that would really be a total crash, IMO. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 10:24:49
Well, I can say Bitcoin has changed not only my way of living but also my entire worldview. Just like a guy from the tweet above said, it changed my mind and an overall understanding of technology and my opportunities. So, it's better to say that Bitcoin made a dent in my life. And I truly believe that someday cryptos will replace common money and replace traditional banks with exchanges like CEX  ([ ) or Coinbase. I'm sure that soon enough secure exchanges with a good reputation will be used by most people in the world.  
@_date: 2018-12-06 10:04:03
 Bitcoin developers can create a donation page so that anyone could easily and anonymously do it. But I assume that Bitcoin Core developer has enough bitcoins to be compensated. I think Luke is going to work part-time on his passion project, and like most people, he is looking for better opportunities to earn.

 Try a UK-based exchange CEX. It’s a reliable and good platform. Usually, it takes less than one hour to get verified. Moreover, the exchange supports GBP apart from USD and EUR. It’s very simple in use so check out the platform. As for me, this exchange is convenient because it offers exchange and trade services in one place.
