My cousin is one of the accused, my family is working so hard with the lawyers to fight back! In my cousin's trial he made a masterclass about the bitcoin and btc mining, I hope my cousin he can get out really soon because I admire him so much and he is a good person!!! Please send your best thoughts and good energy so he can be strong!!!!!!
In Venezuela the legal process can take a while so i can do my best to keep you posted!
