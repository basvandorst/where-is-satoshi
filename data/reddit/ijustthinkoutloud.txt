This is not a dip that should be bought. What if they go to court and it does get exposed that they are a farce? That's the end of the coin and everyone holding it.
If you want to participate in this price action then you should be scalping, unless you're a believer

They changed my account information to match the name of the previous tenant in my rental. Then they locked the boxes and prevented me from changing it back to my name. Want to know the best part? It messed with my chrome autofill and now it puts in the previous tenant name and not my own on websites other than coinbase.
This was their response to me trying to get verified. I emptied out my wallet to prove it was me on video and they decided that an appropriate response was to not verify my account and instead change my information against my will.
And surprise surprise, no help from coinbase

This is their business. They are ethically obligated to improve their customer service area and be able tonoperate during high volatility times. Every other exchange can do it except coinbase, who just locks their services to avoid reporting losses. They are crooks through and through

Go both directions and keep your Stop loss tighter than your take profit

They probably manually went through their records. I was sending images and videos of me emptying out my wallet one after the other to get their attention so they could get someone who breathes through their nose to confirm that I am the man whose face and name is repeatedly coming up on the cards that I'm pulling from my wallet. But no. Instead they changed my name and locked me out from changing it.

They lock their services during volatility to avoid reporting any losses. They definitely have enough money to contract an entire call centre, they just don't want to, because coinbase is extremely capitalist as we've seen by their behaviour. As long as money is rolling in they won't fix their service, cause it ain't broke. Adding customer support is just an expense that doesn't increase their bottom line at the end of the day

"Oh, my credit is tanked? That's ok, I got into bitcoin in 2017"

This was really cool to read. Thank you elder.

You are missing the point.
When laymen refer to cryptocurrency, the first and only noun they use from that point until they decide to delve full-time into it is BITCOIN.
That's why I used Qtips and Kleenex. It's brand power. 
It's not like anyone on the Pan Am to go snap some polaroids of some foreign fords now do they?
Just shut up man you look like a fool in this thread.
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:47:33
So.... they use the weight of their position to keep the price low and purchase a lot, and then release the weight of their position and sell the lot after the price springs up?
I guess it's possible if you're soros level
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:23:32
Most people are hedging in and out and betting on a big transaction affecting market price is a ridiculous notion.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:23:29
So, which crypto is going to dethrone bitcoin?
Bitcoin is q-tips and kleenez.
Even when the package says "cotton ear swabs" everybody calls them Q-tips. Same thing goes for facial tissues. It's not a facial tissue, it's kleenex, even when it's a completely different brand, it's still kleenex.
Same thing goes for bitcoin. When people are explaining the benefits of other cryptos, they are going to be comparing them against bitcoin. It's bitcoin.
Asserting that the primary crypto will be anything other than bitcoin is pretty silly.

It's capital gain, but only when its converted back into a taxable currency.
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:21:05
Altcoins are penny stocks. You get in only if you are able to at minimum or free price and liquidate it for real asset value after the first spike. They are alternative growth streams for the primary currency, btc.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:03:22
On brand power alone? of course not, there are a lot more reasons.
And yeah, pretty much. It's 2017. This is the age of marketing where social reach and brand power are the biggest factors. 
And you still haven't answered my question, you've just responded with typical redditor crap. Which coin will surpass bitcoin and be the primary cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:48:27
I've done forex trading for a couple years, I've only just turned all my attention to cryptos.. It requires immense wealth to be able to do that on the forex market, but yeah, it totally makes sense that it can be done with BTC.  Trading is such a hustle if you know what you're doing

No, reddit is here for people to exchange ideas and learn, not be an elitist for being a part of a subreddit for longer than newcomers. 
How the fuck are we going to move towards mass adoption if we shame every person that asks a genuinely good question. 
I'm sorry you have already grown sick of hearing people ask about wallets because that's going to be your life for the next decade or two until bitcoin becomes as common as ipods were.

This is the stupidest thing I've ever read.
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:31:08
Perhaps, but that begs the longterm question: Does the US Government fear that Bitcoin has the ability to overtake USD at any point in the future?
If they do fear that BTC will overthrow USD, they would be trying to stop it, not monitor it.
So does that mean that the US government doesn't see BTC as a threat? And if that's the case, is that just stupidity on their part or do they know something that retail users do not?
I could go on and on. All in all this is a really interesting piece of the puzzle. Bitcoin is exciting

I don't buy anything from anyone. All information on TA is out there to read for free.
And if someone does have a solid strategy, the best thing to do is to sell it. It's a business asset, and assets should be leveraged to yield as much profit as possible. I could sell my own strategy, but the work involved for me to do that is much more strenuous for me than just trading. However, if the opportunity arose to market myself and my strategy I would do it in a heartbeat. Just like selling signals. I already make money off my strategy, but if I could get more capital by selling signals, why wouldn't I? The "if it's so good why are they selling it" is a stupid line of thought. If it works, it should be sold through EVERY avenue. Book, blog, signals, everything.

Totally. And to an extent you are right, bots place something like 90% of trades on the Fx market. Humans can still scrape a profit with it if they are clever and disciplined.
@_date: 2018-02-25 16:17:48
You completely misunderstand the point of business. 
I'm not selling it right now. Like I said before, I'm a trader, not a salesman. I could *very easily* make a phone call to one of my friends in marketing to go for a beer and we could hash out a sales plan and have it go live in 3 months. 
See here is the thing. *you say* why would they sell it if they can just use it and make profit. *I say* why wouldn't you do both? It has nothing to do with generosity, it has everything to do with greed. It's another avenue of income off the same product - which is my trading strategy.
What if my strategy has a downturn and there are no opportunities for 4 weeks? Or if my strategy produces 5 bad trades in a row? That's a month of losses with no income whatsoever - unless of course, I am also selling it on the side. Let's say I make 4 sales in that week and recover some of my losses and my bottomline for that month isn't as bad as it would be if I was trading exclusively. See the incentive to sell?
I can't stand the "well if it's profitable why are you selling it?" rhetoric. That would be like a farmer inventing a new combine attachment and choosing not to patent and sell it because he doesn't want to give his competitors an edge. It's absolutely fucking retarded through and through.  Trading is business, and business exists for the sole purpose of creating income. If you can't wrap your head around that, I don't know what to tell you.. maybe go hand out some resumes somewhere?

TA is a school of thought that has been around for 100s of years. Just because some people don't use it correctly doesn't mean it doesn't work.
