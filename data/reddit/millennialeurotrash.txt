I've been away from bitcoin for a couple months. Is the Lightning Network thingie done yet? And what's going on with the bCash scammers and fakeToshi, are they still around? And what about the Winklevii and aantonop and interesting new developments with TX fees and what not?
Thanks / still hodling.

What if they shut off the internet though?
@_date: 2019-05-17 07:48:43
Will it actually be a WiFi signal? Or will it be 3G, what?
@_date: 2019-05-07 05:46:51
Not the whole internet. Just the internet for people who really actually need bitcoin to survive (not us). You know, like in Venezuela.
@_date: 2019-05-21 15:22:16
So what's he gonna do with this since bitcoin is open source... ?
