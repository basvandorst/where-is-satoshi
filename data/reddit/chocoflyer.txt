KeepKey, Trezor, and Ledger are all on sale today. Trezor's the most expensive with shipping and Trezor 2 is coming out soon anyway and Ledger is closed-source so I'm getting a KeepKey! It looks like they are based in Seattle (lots of talented and experienced technology folks there) and reviews say the build quality is quite high so I'm looking forward to mine, wanted to share the deal here!
