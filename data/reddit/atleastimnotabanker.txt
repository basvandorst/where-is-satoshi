I was doing sports this morning when I checked the price and news, convinced that it would go lower.
I panicked and sold all my bitcoin. Since then I'm wondering all day if I made a huge mistake, especially because I fucked up and entered by accident a much lower selling price than I planned to and the btc instantly got sold...

To be fair, the value of the bitcoin network dropped by ~30%. That is large financial crisis level. Also, it's not yet clear if there will be more damage coming. MtGox wasn all solved after 2 weeks either

For transactions of that large value, you are most likely bound by law anyways to take their personal details (money laundering laws).
If the customer defrauds you, you sue him and you will get your money (and depending on the sum, he will go to prison).
Just because you use bitcoin as a payment method, doesn't mean that regular laws are not applicable. In my opinion double spend attacks are mostly an issue for online sales where you don't know the customer.

When looking at Arab countries for Bitcoin adoption, Dubai is probably your best bet.
The link below was published earlier this week: 
Dubai is very liberal (for an Arab country) and very open to private investments. In the last couple of years they innitiated a couple of programs to encourage and support.
Also, the average person in the UAE is very wealthy and educated.
Saudi Arabia is a completely different world. There you have a very small upper class and a much larger poor population. Also, Saudi Arabia is very restrictive when it comes to private investments.

Of course you are right, just that the majority of people would keep their money in a bank account. Yes, you are dependent on the bank being solvent, but most people would take that risk in exchange for not being able to lose their money by dropping it.

While I believe in bitcoin and think their predictions are quite optimistic, a 0.02 chance to have 200 USD turn into 1 million is actually quite fantastic. If this estimation became mainstream thinking, nobody should play in the lottery anymore and instead invest their gambling money into bitcoin. 
IIRC the chance to win the jackpot in Germany is somewhere around one in 200 million for a 1 euro ticket, so that's roughly a 0.0001 % chance to make a million for the same investment

China creates the equivalent of another new Greek economy every four months. Imagine, their growth got halved - from currently 8% to 4% - from an economical perspective this would be the same as if entire Greece + two other countries the same size just disappeared EVERY YEAR. If China is hit by a crisis, there is no way this will not have a major impact on the rest of the world. Just one example: By now, China is the largest market for Germany's most exported good: premium cars. If the Chinese stop buying those cars, the impact for Germany will be a lot worse than if Greece defaults

You first buy a voucher denominated in AED which you will receive once the bank transaction went through (usually takes around a day). With the voucher you can then buy bitcoins, the price is guaranteed when you make the purchase. The delivery of the bitcoins then takes between an hour and a day (according to my own experience).
I believe bank transfers only work if you have a bank account in the UAE though

I've used BitOasis a couple of times. They are quite good and have very fast support via livechat. Can only recommend them.

I know... 
I have already have a Trezor, but still I feel like there are a lot of ways to quickly lose money in Bitcoin.
For example, when BitFinex got hacked, I panicked and sold most of my Bitcoin - They weren't hacked, I'm not using BF, but I was afraid the price would tank even more so I wanted to minimize losses. After a few days, the price however went up again and after waiting 2 more weeks to make sure there weren't any other dumps, I bought the coins back (yet at a higher price).
Doing this, I lost a couple of thousand USD - If my family knew about this, they would think I am crazy and I would have to have serious discussions about investing in Bitcoin again - Regardless of the significant net profit I made so far with trading BTC

You have a very seller-centric view. Here is why I love amazon:
1) All sellers sell through the same layout - this makes it is super easy to check and compare prices
2) All sellers have to follow clear Amazon guidelines. As a buyer, I know I won't get ripped off and if something is not the way I like I have the full support of Amazon to handle my claim
3) Now for items directly sold by Amazon: Cheap because of scale and their pressure on suppliers, Amazing delivery times because of their best-in-class value chain, extremely good customer support
Don't get me wrong, I actually like the idea of OB, but I will probably prefer Amazon for pretty much every item I could think of. I usually don't buy hand made stuff and there are also no products censored in my country that I actually wanted to buy.

Including Gavin's response:
There has always been a split among bitcoiners on how best to interact with regulators and law enforcement.
There is the "ignore them, they're illegitimate. Honey Badger don't care" side.
And there's the "engage them, educate them, show them the positive benefits to balance the negatives that are, otherwise, probably the only thing they see" side.
I still think engaging is the best strategy. Yes, there will be more failures like the BitLicense, but overall I think every positive interaction with law enforcement or regulators helps move opinions from "Bitcoin is Evil and must be eliminated" towards "Bitcoin is an innovative technology that should be allowed to grow."
And no, I don't think "we" will compromise the technology or our deeply held beliefs because we interact with "them."
At least, I know I won't. If you are worried that talking to the FBI about the latest version of CryptoLocker might corrupt your morals, then great-- nobody will twist your arm to participate.

I wasn't fully serious, after all I kept onto my precious coins for quite some time now. If I had really believed there was no future, I would have probably sold them by now.
However, it does feel good to see them increase in value again. I still need a few more green bars to reach the average price I paid for them, though...
@_date: 2017-05-25 05:23:43
You are missing the point :)
Market cap is calculated by multiplying the number of issued coins times the latest price (as opposed to the actual price at which each coin was sold). 
If I buy one bitcoin and pay double the current price and nobody else in the world was selling, I would raise the market cap by 40 billion USD (double the current market cap) while only 5000 USD (double the current price) was invested.

Considering the size of the bitcoin economy, any impact would be negligible. It might be more useful to look for fintech-friendly policies in general.

I believe that the MI5 could get this information from the exchanges that I am currently using anyways, so I don't see what more information I am giving up.
Further, the reason why Bitcoin is valuable to me is that it is a hard currency which I can really own and which I can easily transfer between countries.
That it is pseudo-anonymous, is a nice added benefit (mostly because other people see value in it), but I don't care too much about that (e.g. I have never bought anything illegal with it, I don't use it to avoid taxes or circumvent capital controls, etc.). 
So as long as I actually receive the BTC in my own wallet, I don't care too much about who owns the ATM.
