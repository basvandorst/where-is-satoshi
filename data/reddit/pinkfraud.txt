It's because gold and plastic are classified by their actual composition of different elements. You can't change element of gold and then call it gold.
But you can fork out of bitcoin to say that it now has 22 million coins instead of 21.

Why is that certain? Just because it is written on a white paper? What makes you so sure that when enough number of people want it, more bitcoin won't be mined?

I don't know bud. People do things that can't be explained. Maybe the answer to that is some people want the currency to be more widespread to stabilize it. Warren and Charlie invest in things they can know with a high probability.
I know it feels like these old farts can't relate to the future but they are wise beyond anyone's imagination. They have proven it time and again.

His crux is that there is a finite amount of gold whether humans like it or not. The same cannot be said for bitcoin.

But then is it differentiated enough to be called something else? Gold and plastic are way different. 22 carat and 18 carat gold versions are differentiated based on the percentage of gold, but still the overall gold on earth is limited.
What makes bitcoin limited other than trust that no one will increase their number? THAT is Buffett and Munger's basis for skepticism.

Stop making investing decisions.

How do you control the votes? What if some bank decides to employ it's whole IT department to downvote their rival bank?
