This might be a very very dumb question... but...
Lets say you bought 1000$ worth of btc when price was 0.003, that would bring you a total 333333 btc. How much would this have impacted the price? That amount of btc is a 1/61 of the total amount of btc there is. 
So, was there actually a time where people could mass buy btc or were those very short lived moments since prices would rise quickly from these 1000$'s from people investing?

what stops someone from painting their own qr?
@_date: 2019-09-15 22:12:28
Fair enough, what stops someone from painting some blocks white so your qr doesn't work anymore? Not hating here, I would just be afraid of some dickhead messing it up
