The key word here is "random." Market price movements appear random in the short term, but in the long term correlate to real and nonrandom events and decisions(even if those movements are nonetheless hard to predict.)

Probably both. I expect the QR code to become illegible as years and meals go by, but characters should last longer. On the other hand, a well-done QR code tattoo would be a lot cooler than a bunch of numbers.
Also, on reflection, it might be useful to have the tattoo somewhere i can read it.

Is it a terrible idea to park my BTC in GDAX, with a permanent STOP/LIMIT order?
I know we usually look askance at exchanges here, but it really helps me sleep knowing that I'm somewhat protected against a sudden crash--which, at this point, seems even more probable than a hack. 
I suppose I could spread my money around 2-3 exchanges to keep probability on my side.
Bad idea, or worse?

It's because all of them are linked to BTC, since BTC is pretty much the only coin that can buy anything. 
If you could trade ARK or whatever else directly for fiat, they would be a lot less synced up.

I'm using a study from, yes, 2013 (the last bitcoin spike) to remind people to store their money safely. If you have objections to that purpose, go ahead. 
Meanwhile, if your confident in the rocklike stability of our modern, regulated exchanges, you may want to visit or to see how well they're working.

As far as I can tell it's not that kind of wallet. The way this one works is by storing coins right on the device, which can be backed up and passworded. You couldn't recover the wallet by re-seeding if the device was lost, for example.

Basically you find someone offering the rate you want and the form of payment you want. First you put your coins into escrow, then release them when you're satisfied with the payment.  Worked fine for me, just don't use paypal.

@_date: 2017-12-17 15:51:22
It went down, and went up again because there were still people who wanted it. That's how supply and demand works.
Old time HODLers will probably stay in the game, but a lot of the new money coming in will probably ditch their coins when they realize BTC isn't a magical money-growing machine.
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:38:01

Does that count as an HD wallet if it's a smartphone app?

The address itself is in the app's address history, but it shows no transactions.

Let's say each node connects to four other nodes. It's pretty easy to imagine an island of five nodes all connected to one another, and no one else.
In reality each node connects to 200 others\(I think\). But is it possible to have a accidental division in the network as I've described? Has anyone calculated the odds?
