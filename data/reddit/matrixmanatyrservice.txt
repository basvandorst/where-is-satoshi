Are you saying you don't think we ought to be working towards a replacement?  Or that you don't think BitPay can pull it off?

Aluminum foil hats aren't as effective.  The Government figured it out years ago, which is why they switched all the foil from tin to aluminum.

To use "x-sigma event" is to presuppose that financial crashes like the one in 2008 are normally distributed events.  That is, their occurrence is random in a very well behaved way (in the same way that a coin flip is).  If markets actually behaved like this, then you could buy a stock, pick a price to sell it at, and then just wait long enough.  At some point, your stock would be worth your target price, and you could sell it and make money.  But that's not actually how it works.  Markets do exhibit statistical fluctuation, but there are other (more important) forces at play too.  Most notably, they respond to people behaving badly.
Even if this were true, 6 is surely not the number.  To say that the financial crisis of 2008 is a "6-sigma event" implies that the likelihood of it happening is six standard deviations out from the center of the bell curve.  By my figuring, that means that--more likely than not--we won't have a financial crash as severe as that for another 1700 years.  Which is quite a bold claim.

Firstly, standard deviations are probably not the tool you're looking for. Secondly, I think you're underestimating just how far out along the bell curve 6-sigma really is.
If your standard for stuff-I'm-going-to-worry-about was six sigma, you'd find a whole lifetime of things to worry about before you ever made it to something so flimsy as money.

I would use that every day, but I bet I'm the only person for quite a long distance in every direction that feels that way.
