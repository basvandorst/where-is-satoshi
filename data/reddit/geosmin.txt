There's just so much... wrong in your comment that needs unpacking. I can't imagine living with such a skewed world-view.  
  
Sweeteners are important for the food industry. Not because they're good for you but because they're used heavily in food products companies make. Apparently things like sodas sell well, but that burden's on the consumer, not the companies (and definitely not the government.)  
  
High fructose corn syrup is subsidized because it's a sweetener derived from corn, which grows well in the States. The US doesn't have the luxury to grow things like, say, cane sugar, and I imagine since corn production is such a big part of the economy the US government doesn't want to have such a big part of the food industry outsourced to countries that can produce sweeteners cheaper.

You have no fucking idea what you're talking about.  
  


  
I don't even know where to start. 50 years? What??? JFK? Something something "end of the decade"? No? Little else? You expecting interstellar spaceflight? The only body we don't have a slew of data and high resolution pictures of is Pluto, and that's like a year away. Or were you expecting the US government to somehow colonize Mars?

I can wager a guess as to which sensationalist headline you read recently, I could also wager a guess that you would have been wise to read the comments before blindly validating your worldview. Confirmation bias is fun.

That's like complaining your bank charges you "prohibitive" fees every time you want to withdraw 4 cents.

For the sake of argument let's assume it does.

I don't disagree with the other points being made either though. Bitcoin has great potential as a fallback currency if one's sovereign state's currency were to fail, or if bitcoin would become as easy to use in people's everyday lives as cash or cards are.  
  
That said, I don't think we're anywhere near that yet, and I also it has a great potential to *fail* as a fallback currency.
  
Only time will tell, economics is weird and this is a completley new thing.

The day I can walk into a local grocerie store and buy a dozen eggs with bitcoins (whether using an android app or not) we'll talk again.  
  
I'm not saying it can't or won't happen, we just aren't there yet.
@_date: 2012-06-24 18:01:00
I'm well aware of that list, I'm just willing to bet at least 51% of the people who have bitcoins don't intend on using them to buy such goods, but rather trade them for a currency more useful to them when value rises.
@_date: 2012-06-22 15:17:38
Good question, I guess the answer is either that it's more profitable for them to do it this way, or more practical. (Perhaps distributing these ultimately leads to the growth and continuation of bitcoin and, in the end, their business and customer base.)  
  
Or we have false or inaccurate information.
@_date: 2012-08-02 22:25:17
I think you missed the joke...
@_date: 2012-06-22 16:23:47
I repeat my point because you seem to misunderstand it. You're addressing the potential of bitcoin in contrast to the state and future of fiat money.
I'm talking about the current real-world practical differences between fiat money and bitcoin, and how this relates to the current intent of the people who hold them. I completely agree with you that if our current money systems fail us bitcoin could be an excellent medium of exchange, at least on paper (pardon the pun).  
  
Right now, a certain amount of bank-issued money has very real practical purchasing power in terms of what it can be used for. Paying one's rent or mortgage, food and groceries, most commodities, etc, etc. Everything that is sold can be bought with it.  
  
What can you buy with bitcoins? Illegal drugs, artisanal gothic hand-made sweaters and maybe a VPN?  
    
I'm obviously understating for emphasis, but my point is that contrarily to gold and currencies bitcoin doesn't really have a real practical value right now, and most of the people who end up holding them are probably hoping to ultimately exchange them for a more practical currency, not goods or services.
@_date: 2012-06-22 16:57:08
Nevermind sir, you're quite dense.
@_date: 2012-08-17 20:05:20
Probably a bad time to buy when on the vertical climb of an exponential curve.
@_date: 2012-06-22 15:33:27
But my point was that until bitcoin has a real economy behind it (which it does, just not at the scale i'm talking about), it's a market where most of the people that have bitcoins have them not because they have any direct useful purchasing value to them, but because ultimatley they are seen an investment to be sold for a return in a *currency* that is useful to the holder.  
  
To me this means, in the end, bitcoin is one giant bubble. Everyone ultimately wants to sell because they rather have real money instead of btc
@_date: 2012-06-22 17:40:15
I specifically put that there to promote discussion about it.
@_date: 2012-06-22 15:12:20
What I *do* find interesting about bitcoin though is that it still has a very little economy, despite it's value. That's all subject to change but right now, at the end of the day, it's a market where everyone is ultimately looking to sell.
@_date: 2011-06-11 12:42:00
I'm very new (hours) to all of this and I think the above is an interesting aspect of an interesting topic. You can take your condescending shit elsewhere.

Could you elaborate on this a bit? It's the first time I hear of it.
@_date: 2011-06-12 02:15:33
Seems fine to me. I don't think we're facing a crash I think we *might* be facing a crash. I have no certitude.  
  
As for "eventually", I'm implying it might not necessarily be in the near future.  
  
Hunches aren't meant to be powerful statements.
