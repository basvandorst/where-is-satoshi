there is nothing stopping an EU country from saying bitcoin is not illegal and that it is tax free
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:54:33
na, not if you are an high earning employee in high tax states. Especially if he is including property taxes

Thank you so much. A lot of valuable stuff you've broken down for me, that I haven't seen anywhere else.

as someone who doesnt know much about it. where do the fees come from? I thought no/low fees was a positive about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:31:02
ok thank you. That seems to be a big issue to me long term. I think one of the big draws of a decentralized system would be a feeless or nearly feeless system (very small fraction).
I wonder if this would give other cryptocurrencies an advantage long term.

you could be making/paying that much in california and be middle class barely making extra money outside of a mortgage. Considering how expensive healthcare has become and education for kids, people can actually be sorta struggling.
Its not like they are poor, but they arent just bringing home a lot of money. It kinda sucks how this class of people gets hurt more than people making much more money who can more easily avoid taxation

I actually dont mind the state tax. I find that it is much better spent. I just hope that federal taxes could be cut so we could do more state taxation/spending here and maybe do our own healthcare system.
I just dont like seeing how much people get taxed in this country and how little they get in return relative to other high tax countries.

The thing is, everyone has this mentality. Do whenever there is a correction I see it being bought up quick.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:06:16
it does thanks

If you live in a big city in a high tax state paying mortgage and college tuitions for your kids, plus the super expensive healthcare premiums that higher earners pay, then you are def middle class.
Now if you take that somewhere else with a much lower cost of living then its a different story, but it ain't that easy.

So these can't be accessed online by others correct?
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:27:31
what are the fees like?
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:56:47
Is that not a like kind exchange. Would you be able to not pay since you are just buying the same thing over again and not really cashing out?
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:02:01
What is a limit order?
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:25:51
Thank you makes sense 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:27:44
Thank you so much. And I was planning to google it. But I like the answers here better, people here know a lot

i mean what benefit is making it the new gold, and not your second option?
right now it can be less secure (at least storing it for the masses), slower, more expensive, more volatile. Yes all those might change and improve as it gets more legitimacy and developed, but what would have been the point?
While i do think people like that it is not controlled by the government, and it brings more competition to currency, I think the bigger appeal was the privacy and the deregulatory aspect to it. It enabled a lot of freedom in expression via how we spend our money.
I think just regulating it to just be a new formal currency will disappoint a lot of the people who bought into what bitcoin was about

Inflation is usually 2-3%. And a lot of funds can get you over 10% returns.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:09:23
Thank you, very informative

What's the difference between gdax and coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:58:39
relative to the world yea. But relative to what we once were for many things, and what we can be/what other leading nations are becoming, we are starting to lag behind.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:23:44
Makes sense. I thought these payments were automatically processed for some reason. I never knew someone had to do it. That makes blockchain a bit less appealing to me.
