Sorry about that :(
Someone started hammering our site with invalid bitcoin orders and it triggered some security measures on our site and caused problems with Coinbase integration too.
I've fixed it now and hopefully this won't happen again.

Yes, shipping to South America is still a challenge, unfortunately. If you want, you can send us an email and we can give you a quote for seamail shipping to Chile. It's not an automatic option on our store yet, but we often ship to people by sea too.
I hate sites that ask for more details than they need too...
@_date: 2014-03-22 00:47:15
Yep, shipping only gets more and more expensive every year with rising fuel costs. It's a killer for small businesses too. We'd like to expand to have stock in continental Europe too eventually, but it takes a lot of time and resources so we're not ready yet. Seamail from the factory is a good, cheaper alternative, but then you'd probably have to pay VAT on the import from outside the EU, so there are pros and cons.

This has crossed my mind too. Considering how big Go is in China and Korea and how much they love gambling, I think your idea could work. 
The major Asian Go servers already have their own virtual money which you can bet on games. I remember seeing an ad (in Chinese) on the site for one of them which said something like, "Lost all your TOM money? Don't cry, you can buy more money!" So they're already doing this, but bitcoin is the perfect next step.
The main challenges would be dealing with regulations, security and breaking into the Asian Go server market. So more or less like any other bitcoin project I guess...
@_date: 2014-10-28 02:34:29
I'm sorry, I'm not sure what your point is. You've only made a series of statements that most people would vaguely agree with.
In any case, a lot of businesses, including mine, do accept bitcoin for their own reasons.
@_date: 2014-03-21 23:46:07
Sorry, that's always the problem with having sales :(
You can email us if you want to talk about it.
@_date: 2014-03-21 23:44:01
Generally we ship from the geographically closest warehouse where we have stock. If we think there's going to be issues with duties based on our experience, we sometimes hold an order and contact the customer, and possibly route the order to another warehouse.
Depending on where you are, you can tell where the order is shipping from by looking at the shipping carriers when you get a shipping quote. 
However, a clearer way would be to email us if you have concerns and we can give you a list of all the options and different shipping costs.

The 5% discount is intended to be a long term thing. It will apply automatically anytime as long as you pay with bitcoin. The 15% offer is just until the end of the weekend because we can't sustain that kind of discount for a long time.
@_date: 2014-03-18 05:15:13
Thanks for answering my questions in such detail. It was helpful and I really appreciate it.
It's on my list to look into other ways of offering the discount (your suggestions should work), but I partly wanted to see what Coinbase would say first. If Coinbase and/or Bitpay did it, it would save thousands of merchants the time needed to implement it by themselves.
I also had it in the back of my mind that it would make it easier for bitcoin merchants to help promote bitcoin by collaborating with some kind of one day bitcoin only sale. Like Bitcoin Black Friday, but it could be done at any time of year. I'd view that sort of promotion as an investment towards eventually killing fraudulent credit card orders for all of us. I know that you've already dealt with this problem ;), but I imagine you might have other stores too.
Anyway, you may be right and I'll just end up implementing it myself.
Also, I totally understand why you have to sell a lot of the coins and I think some redditors here, though well meaning, sometimes don't get that. If we had 100% of our sales in bitcoin, we'd have to sell some too - to pay suppliers, freight agents, shipping companies (actually basically everyone now that I think about it) until such a time as those people were also willing to accept bitcoin. Partly the reason why we don't convert bitcoin back is that we can afford to because it's such a small fraction of our cash flow at the moment.
I've actually been planning to buy some new hardware, so I'll check your site out on the weekend and probably place a real order to see how things work. :)

Right, the fact that the game is hard for computers was one of the things that interested me when I first heard about it too. In recent years, there have been some improvements using Monte Carlo methods to help select moves, but top players can still crush a computer.
Adding BTC to the currency list is on the todo list, we're just always busy with something else. At the moment, we only update that list (automatically) once per day, so that's one reason why we don't display XBT.

Our site is about the unfortunately named game 'Go'. I didn't want to spam reddit with a link earlier, but you can read more about the game on our site here: 
Go is an awesome game, worth checking out if you've never heard of it (I'm biased though). It's a two player game kind of like chess, so some board gamers find it a bit too serious, but it's very rich in strategy and tactics if you enjoy those sorts of games.
Go was invented in Asia a few thousand years ago. Nobody really knows for sure exactly how old it is, because it's so old.
EDIT: Also check out this trailer for an upcoming documentary about the game that some other guys are making:

Shipping in Europe is from the UK, but some equipment is quite heavy.
If you want you can email us and we can give you the price for seamail shipping to your country, which might be cheaper. Adding seamail as an option on the website is on our list of things to do, but we've been too busy and improving the bitcoin integration has been a higher priority.

Sorry about the problems with Coinbase, I've fixed it again and the checkout is working again now. Waiting for Coinbase's merchant people to call me back... We did look into Bitpay earlier, but I'll check them out again.
These Chinese style plastic stones will also (just) fit on the 13x13/9x9 board you're interested in:  and are the cheapest stones we sell.
However, I think you'd have a better experience if you just got the Bento Box (and maybe don't get the wooden board if it's too expensive). They're much nicer than the cheap stones. The 'Featherweight' set which I also recommended in the original post is very light and cheap to ship and the stones are still nicer than the 'Dirt Cheap' stones (which are heavier, so check the shipping prices too before deciding).
If you have questions or need help figuring out the prices including shipping, feel free to get in touch.
@_date: 2014-03-22 00:59:37
Thanks, the 15% discount is only for this weekend. After that it will be 5%. I'll make a note to edit this listing as soon as I have time. For small merchants, time is always in short supply.
@_date: 2014-03-21 14:29:45
Thanks! You probably got the James Hanson set in a cream box? That set is everywhere and many players started with it, including me. 
The stones are quite small (there's actually a standard size for Go sets), but it's perfectly fine when you're just starting to learn.
@_date: 2014-03-18 02:27:19
Thanks for sharing this info, it was a very interesting read.
We also accept bitcoin at our store (though not exclusively) and there are literally only a few customers that use it. It's well under 1% of total sales and I was starting to wonder if most stores were seeing the same thing. Maybe selling tech is better than selling board games as far as bitcoin is concerned right now? That seems likely.
In one sense, we're not too worried because we believe in the technology and expect that more people will begin to use bitcoin as time passes. However, we would like to be able to offer a flat discount of something like 5% for bitcoin sales, which we could advertise next to bitcoin on our homepage.
We redirect bitcoin customers to Coinbase at checkout solely to help with converting USD prices to BTC (not to sell the coins). I asked Coinbase recently whether they'll add a setting for merchants to enable a simple x% discount on all bitcoin orders and I'm waiting for a response. I hope they'll take the idea on board.
How do manage the checkout process at your store? I imagine that since you're only dealing with bitcoin you might just poll a web service for USD conversion rate yourselves and then give each customer a pre-generated address to send their payment to? Please don't share anything that you don't feel comfortable sharing, but I am interested and quite curious about the workflow.
@_date: 2014-11-11 22:39:09
Wait, are you trying to convert KRW to USD? There are massive savings to be had at the moment.
We usually trade in the other direction (USD to KRW) to pay factories for goods and recently the bitcoin price has been slightly depressed in South Korea (relative to elsewhere), but we're still saving about 4-5% overall compared to sending the money through the banking system from the US.
Have you looked at  ?
Based on the spot price right now, you can effectively buy 1 USD for about 1055 KRW. According to Google the current average is about 1095 KRW, so that's already a 3.5% saving (which gives you more than enough room for exchange fees). Not to mention the fact that you're not going to get 1095 KRW to the dollar from your bank, because their profit margin will be built into it.
Earlier in the year we were saving up to 9% in total by sending funds using bitcoin, even after factoring in a 1% exchange fee on both sides.
Look at the exchange rate you're actually getting from the bank and then compare it to buying 1 USD for 1055 KRW. Tell me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2014-10-26 23:48:49
On top of that, they also fine you $25 (which is in addition to the cost of the stolen inventory) every time someone issues a chargeback. In four years of doing business online my business has had one semi-legit chargeback (guy wasn't happy with his order, but could've just got a free return + refund if he'd just emailed us) and a whole lot of fraudulent chargebacks.
It may be different with businesses run by dodgy operators, but for honest business owners, chargebacks are practically 100% fraud :(. Reputation systems are the way to go.
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:26:30
Great, we're in!
In terms of filling out the form, where it says:


Is this an image of the deal item(s), our logo, a small ad or something else? We looked at the website for examples from last year of how this will be formatted, but the whole site is [somewhat opaque](
We support what you're doing and want to suggest that you make things a bit clearer for merchants. They're generally busy people and if they come along to offer a deal and the instructions aren't clear, they might give up or put it off for later, and then forget to come back in time. This is actually why we didn't end up listing a deal last year.

Thanks everyone for your support and for exposing some bugs in the Coinbase integration. We talked to Coinbase about the issues today and the problems seem to be fixed now.
We've ended the sale now, but the 5% discount will continue, because that's just us passing bitcoin savings back to you.
We've only recently switched to using Coinbase, so this served as a really good stress test for bitcoin payments on our store. Thanks again!
@_date: 2014-03-21 15:47:54
Cool, I'll have a look at it over the weekend. I'm buried in work, but even if I can't help I can probably send some other go players your way :)
@_date: 2014-03-23 23:29:09
Well on the Go servers, other people bet on the games between the top players. It's basically like betting on a coin toss since the outcome is (more or less) binary. I think the best way to do it is for the players themselves take a rake (%) of the betting pool, that way there's less incentive to throw a game.
If you resign, you don't lose money, you just don't get money. Or maybe you get less than you would have got otherwise.
However, sometimes if you want to play Go with a random person in Asia (not online), they'll want to bet money on the outcome. This can be either a set amount per game or this:  (which I think is what you were referring to earlier). So I guess there are a few different models one could use.
If you're thinking about building a server or something and want to talk about it more, feel free to get in touch here:  - also was commenting earlier and he's already built a server and might be interested in selling it.

It's talking about bad things that the Americans brought to China, but the original had nothing to do with bitcoin :)
@_date: 2014-03-22 00:14:06
No, if you read carefully it's a sale for bitcoin only. Of course we can't sustain it, but it's 15% off for the weekend only.
We're willing to offer a permanent 5% 'discount' for bitcoin orders, because bitcoin is cheaper to accept and even if we give up the lower transaction costs it's good for us if more customers use it. The cost of dealing with credit card payments is already built into our prices, we're basically just giving that back.
Have you really never seen a 10% off sale before?
The true cost of accepting credit cards is actually quite high in my opinion. There are the merchant fees for basic credit card service, expensive third party anti-fraud services (which still aren't 100% effective), the cost of lost goods when a fraudulent order does go through, lost time and frustration, and so on.
You know that when someone uses a stolen credit card and then the owner issues a chargeback, that's not the whole story, right? The big credit card companies make a song and dance about how great they are refunding people's money and how you're protected (so the poor security of the system doesn't matter).
Let me tell you, they simply rip that money straight back off the small merchant, who hasn't done anything wrong. When you try to talk to them about it, they're impossible to deal with. They have they power and they couldn't care less. It's not our fault if someone has their card details stolen, but we're the ones who are forced to take responsibility and pay for this 'security', because nobody else will. Why don't the credit card companies foot the bill if their system is so great?
So, yes, we can afford to give a 5% discount to people who pay with bitcoin and still benefit. And if you think rounding up to five is too generous, consider it an investment in a better future...
@_date: 2014-03-18 21:39:08
Thanks for letting me know. I'll think about where else we can mention bitcoin. That part of the site isn't a shop and doesn't talk about other payments methods either. It's for teaching people to play Go.

Cool, I learned to play on KGS ( for anyone who's interested (needs Java)
I'm 7 dan on Tygem, but I don't play as much as I used to because making the website takes up a lot of my free time these days.
My teacher and partner in this site is An Younggil. He's an 8 dan pro from Korea. Check out the other part of our site for free game commentaries and things. Younggil commented a Japanese title match from last week here: 
For anyone who's new to Go, who's also reading this, Go is taken quite seriously in Asia (where it originated). They view it kind of like a mental martial art and you can become a pro in Asia (kind of like becoming a pro chess player).
Go uses the same ranking system that martial arts do, with kyu and dan ranks (like the different belts in Karate). Fun fact: the ranking system was first invented for Go and then used for martial arts too.

It's called playing the long game. Merchants who support bitcoin do so because the current system is broken and they hope the world will be better in a decade.
I agree that 10% is a bit much for most businesses to be able to afford on an ongoing basis. We offer a 5% discount for bitcoin orders, because we have to pay 3% (+30c) for credit card processing anyway and we can afford the extra ~2% precisely because we know that customers who pay with bitcoin are not going to be fraudsters and because for small purchases bitcoin is much cheaper.
The typical retail business has to pay credit card processing fees (2-3%), a monthly subscription for some kind of 3rd party fraud detection software/service (which isn't foolproof and should be provided by the credit card company anyway), the cost of stolen inventory from people using stolen credit cards and an additional fine from the credit card company every time someone uses a stolen card (for us the fine is $25 and the business is the last person who should be held responsible for the shortcomings of the credit card system).
You might not agree that bitcoin is the solution to all this, or you might not see things from the merchant perspective, but surely we can agree that the current system leaves a great deal to be desired?
@_date: 2014-03-18 21:36:45

The code can be upgraded later and as far as I know that's the intention. This isn't a chain fork.

I just got a link to the code in question for you (habit I guess), but then I remembered that posting it would upset this specially managed echo chamber and would get me banned.
But don't believe what random commenters on reddit (like me) tell you! If you're inclined to check for yourself, you can have a look, starting at line 1194 of /src/main.cpp, and form your own judgment.
I guess this points to why people in keep repeating things with no basis in reality - nobody can link them to an alternative viewpoint (cool experiment in social control though, if you're into that sort of thing).

There are so many people mining now that you'd have to make a large investment in special hardware (called an ASIC - application specific integrated circuit) to mine efficiently (competitively).
You'd have to calculate beforehand whether you'll be able to break even and then start making a profit, based on the hardware price, your electricity costs and the expected increases in *difficulty*.
When you mine bitcoin, your hardware is basically solving difficult math problems which help to verify that other people's bitcoin transactions are legit. Because you're providing a service, the bitcoin network will reward (pay) you in bitcoins for your efforts.
However, as the amount of computing power directed at mining increases, the bitcoin network automatically increases the *difficulty* of mining, which roughly means your hardware has to solve more math problems before you get paid. It needs to do this to protect the bitcoin network from hackers as computers become more powerful.
If too many people are trying to get in on the gold rush (probably the case) or hardware speeds increase too quickly, the difficulty might increase too quickly for you to make money. You might only be able to break even, and you might even lose money, so getting into mining is risky.
If you have free electricity, it might be worth investigating a bit more, but be careful.

The reason why we don't list BTC or XBT or whatever in currency is because we pull all our rates from webservicex ( but they don't have rates for [USD to BTC](
Also, even if they did, we'd have to update our rates more often because of the current volatility of Bitcoin. That's not really a big deal for us (it might be for webservicex though).
After following Bitcoin for a couple years now, I finally added it as a payment method about three months ago, but nobody's purchased anything with it yet. Even payment by check is still more popular, which kind of sucks. This is probably partly because we haven't done enough to promote it. I've been planning to write a post about it for a few months (was going to use this:  but we haven't even been able to keep up with our normal posts recently so it's been on the back burner and we decided to just mention it in Jing's article about the new book for now.

**TLDR;** *we accept Dwolla, as well as bitcoin, in our store. In our experience, nobody seems to use Dwolla. I've been hoping Dwolla would pivot and become a bitcoin exchange, but it sounds like that's not going to happen. A bit disappointed with Dwolla :(*
We accept both Dwolla and bitcoin payments in our store at gogameguru.com, but bitcoin is much (infinitely?) more popular as a payment method from what we've seen.
When I say that, I should clarify that, so far, a small percentage of customers like to pay with bitcoin, whereas nobody has ever paid for anything with Dwolla, in almost 12 months of the option being available on the site. We've been thinking about removing Dwolla from the checkout because of this.
We only found out about Dwolla and setup a merchant account with them in the first place because of the bitcoin community.
I've thought for months that the logical thing for Dwolla to do at this stage would be to pivot and become a leading bitcoin wallet provider (or exchange) themselves. It seems like the perfect time to do so, since they've already setup so much transferable infrastructure. They could still provide their existing USD services too, so it sounds like win win to me. However, this line from their email:


...seems to imply that that's not what their plan is.
That's disappointing and I can't imagine that the idea wouldn't have been seriously discussed internally. It's just too obvious.
Maybe they thought the (not insignificant) regulatory hurdles and the risks involved would be too great? 
Or maybe they feared that adopting bitcoin would alienate some of their banking partners, with whom they seem to have formed close relationships?
I've read that many banks have been adopting Dwolla's FiSync network (a faster alternative to ACH) behind the scenes. Perhaps Dwolla wasn't willing to risk what they'd build so far?
Of course, there are also risks involved in not adapting and fading into obscurity, but perhaps if FiSync is doing well then Dwolla is content to become another behind the scenes financial service powering other people's products, like Yodlee, for example...
Anyway, disappointing.

Good idea! I'll look into how to do that when I have time.

No worries mate. I've watched you give away much more than that, over time, to promote bitcoin. Just think of it as a small donation towards your continuing good work as the bitcoin proselytizing santa claus :)
Perhaps some other people will tip you too if they feel the same way.

Thanks, I was wondering about that.

It's not really that different to any other mail order business though is it? It's all about reputation and trust. You pay him, he sends the widget. If it all goes well, maybe you'll tell your friends and he'll get more customers. If 50 people here or some people you know in person said "I sent him money and he was solid," would that change your mind at all?
Sure he could rip people off and profit more in the short term, but that's a short term strategy...
That said, I wouldn't send money to him either :)

I know. That's because it's the smart thing to do for someone who actually wants to run a serious business and not lose money. Got a better idea?
EDIT: To clarify, I'm basically trying to say, don't do it, it will make your life unnecessarily difficult.

Oh, so they're all the same? I'll trade you 10 LTC for 10 BTC. 
They're the same anyway, right? If not, how do you explain the difference?

I think you should anchor the price in whatever currency you're spending to have them made. Then you can use something like this: 
From here: 
To convert the price to BTC on the front end of your website. That way the customer never sees a USD price (for example), only a BTC price, but you know exactly what's going on behind the scenes, without things getting confusing.
Keep it simple. Once you actually start selling things and dealing with customer inquiries, you'll have a lot of other things to worry about and you won't want to be having to worry about your prices every day. When things get to the point where you can pay your suppliers and any other intermediaries in BTC, then you'll be able to calculate your costs more accurately and switch entirely to bitcoin if you want to.

Ok, got it. Thanks for explaining :)

You guys should get in touch with the Financial Ombudsman: 
They actually have a fair bit of clout and I'll bet that CBA will get start sorting things out more quickly as soon as they get a call from the Ombudsman.

That sounds like a cool idea, but what's the stop the local bank from blacklisting transactions to them too? Would it have changed anything in this case?
