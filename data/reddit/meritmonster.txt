Helloo, want some bit coin?, mmm, yes, just give me your card umber and i will send in mail.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:00:08
What bank?
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:25:23
Because they do not have the fiat cash to pay you.
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:54:30
Makes me wonder where all the exchanges get the fiat cash to pay out on the rising price of bitcoin.  May be from new fiat deposits...mmm
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:50:47
2012 ish. still sad.  :(
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:26:12
ALT's ICO's are off the chart. so much BS out there skinning people.  What happened to BTC being an ALTERNATIVE currency, as apposed to now, we just peg is value against local currency, seems to be defeating the whole object of BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:06:18
Bro i sold 12 btc for $200 dollar on btc-e.  i still have sick in my mouth.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:08:02
No idea.  But i buy with credit card.  So the only thing on my bank statements is the credit card repayments.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:13:16
But what will the fees be...
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:07:34
I fail to see how someone with a spare 10k, would be so careless.  Also, why would you save up the money, when he could have brought in -all the way up.  Meh!

@_date: 2017-11-16 16:45:31
Aye, not like you can do much with a wallet, if you give the keys away.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:29:50
Sound's like a cosy arrangement 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:57:18
meh, forget it.   $600
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:56:16
Yeah, been thinking along the same line's.  Pump, twitch and cash out, many follow, fearing risk of losing fiat value. repeat.  Whales always come up to breath a new breath for the next hunt.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:37:41
Are you stealing from your future self?
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:58:59

So you could use a little more energy, to recoup a fraction of the original energy usage, once plugged in receive a rebate in Crypto

I was right behind ya. lucky man.
@_date: 2017-10-18 09:00:35
Don't think anyone would sell BTC via paypal.  Try local bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:09:56
Thank you.  
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:47:57
Don't you get a receipt?  Weston union to strangers, you wild man!  I'm under the impression , that they will have to pass BTC to the escrow, then confirm receipt of funds.  Before the cash was released-if Weston union is a local bitcoin legit payment option.  Only ever used it to sell, awhile ago.  OH, and you would have to confirm getting the btc.
@_date: 2017-10-11 19:40:11
Aye, just checked, EU only, sorry .
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:11:42
Just empty my coinbase account.  Has notice up, of longer than usual BTC transaction times....
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:05:14
Same old scam.    Looks a bit like the auroramine  one.  
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:48:28
Whats it say.?
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:24:55
Did you manually adjust the fee's yourself? Say zero.
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:22:36
This is in the Blockchain wallet FAQ.   Guessing they will make provisions for the coming fork too.
How can I access Bitcoin Cash?
If you had Bitcoin in your wallet prior to the fork on August 1, 2017, you can access your Bitcoin Cash in Settings &gt; General. If not, ignore this message. Or click here to see the about and get started.
