It wouldn't vanish.  Some people would have the REAL money, and a lot of people would have a bunch of fake internet net money that's worthless.  Also, it's not if it will crash, it's when.

What!?  No... That's not how markets work at all.

Incorrect, it's backed by the govt.   The gold standard was hindering the economy.  You realize that gold isn't backed by ANYTHING, right!?  It's not particularly useful for anything outside of making jewelry.

It has value, because people have faith in it, and because it's backed by the most powerful govt in the world.
There is nothing backing cryptocurrency.  "Investing" is mere market speculation, and when it crashes you will have a group of winners and losers.  The winners will have all the real money, and the losers will have all the fake internet money.  
Personally, I couldn't do that.  My success depends on another's suffering.

Where do you think this money comes from?

The US dollar isn't going to crash anytime soon.  If your currency is far less stable, then I could maybe understand. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:29:15
It is not incorrect.  As long as the US govt is around, so shall be the US dollar.   That's why the US dollar is among the best investments in the world. 
Cryptocurrency is and shall ever be a form of gambling or market speculation, at best.

Yah, that's why china is holding tons of our debt, right?!   Get real.. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:31:08
No, it comes from other people.   And what happens when the system inevitably crashes?  You have some people with real money, and a lot of people with fake money. 
It's a scam.

They aren't buying as much now, because there are better investments out there.   They are buying real estate now.

Gold has no inherent value.  It's not particularly good for anything.  The ONLY value it has is it's corrosion resistance in electronics, which isn't necessary in usual electronics.

Because you own a fraction of a tangible company that is actually worth something.

No, if the US goes down, everyone goes with it.  Were you awake in 2008? 
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:54:59
No, I do know.  There is nothing outside of an extreme catastrophic event that could cause it to collapse.  In the chances of that catastrophic event, we would all be fucked.  Fake internet money would be hit the hardest, because everyone would try to cash out.

It USD's value, because people have faith in it, and because it's backed by the most powerful govt in the world.

No, a company has actual tangible assets that have value.   Bitcoin has no value outside the faith system.

ROFL.. Wow.

Total bullshit...  The govt lives or dies by it's currency. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:32:05
Exactly.  And what happens when coin inevitably crashes, and becomes near worthless?
