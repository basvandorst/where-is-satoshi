Are there any other restaurants in Paris that take Bitcoin? I am currently in Paris, and am looking to spend!
@_date: 2014-04-18 15:34:29
I would jailbreak for this.

Yes, Ledger is working on a card/screen with NFC built in.
@_date: 2014-06-19 23:44:59
Do you guys plan on making an iPad app as well, for me chants, etc?
@_date: 2014-05-21 16:39:59
Pffft. Rookie : 
@_date: 2014-08-21 18:31:04
I signed up on the very first day they offered invites, and only received mine 3 days ago.
@_date: 2014-12-14 00:41:19
Bitcoins are not made as such. They are discovered.
You can easily buy stuff on Amazon. I do it all the time. You can buy gift cards from Gyft.com with Bitcoin.
Don't mine.
See? Easy!
@_date: 2014-06-05 00:25:32
Must buy all the yacoin! To the yamoooooon!
@_date: 2014-05-16 04:43:47
This alone is going to make me switch from Coinbase, and make it my go to for buying.
@_date: 2014-08-18 19:20:03
Yeah, I signed up on the first day as well. Got my invite the other day. Hope they come ut with a mobile app soon.
@_date: 2014-06-21 20:59:44
This. It's a pain to manually buyback every time. Looking forward to automatic buys.
@_date: 2014-12-24 09:26:42
Just received mine. Really great experience. 
I'm looking forward to their card with a screen, but for now, it's great.
I would like to have the option to show fiat values in the wallet, but they are working on updating the Chrome software, so no real problems. 
In short, it's exactly what I am looking for. A high level of security without having to open private keys from cold wallets. I'll have a hot web wallet with Circle with a few hundred dollars, and the rest on the Ledger.
@_date: 2014-05-22 18:54:13
Got out a month ago. Went completely into BTC and Darkcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-16 00:56:02
Doesn't work either : 
@_date: 2014-06-03 17:51:09
I live in Paris, and am going back in a month, but in general, people might know about Bitcoin, but there are very few places that accept it.
Is there a good list of places that accept it?
@_date: 2014-06-19 23:52:28
The app still has the same problem with scanning QR codes as it did in the old app before it was banned. 
I am using an ipad. 
@_date: 2014-12-24 10:03:55
You write down 24 words randomly generated when you set up your wallet.
@_date: 2014-05-22 19:28:46
Yeah, I lost a few mbc because I was confused in the beginning. Had to restart a new wallet. 
Tested it, and it worked fine, and then sent my coins back.
Alpha is alpha.
@_date: 2014-05-21 16:47:41
A pile of fail a couple of days after they emerged? C'mon. They want to get their service to everyone, but they have to test and ramp to allow for a good process.
Otherwise, you release it to everyone and it fucks up, and then everyone complains? Give it time. Believe me, I want to switch over fro Coinbase, although they are not a bad service, but the no fees is obviously extremely attractive. 
@_date: 2014-06-09 04:28:15
Possibly : 
@_date: 2014-10-21 17:04:45
I live in San Fran. Is there a list of merchants that I can spend at? Coinmap isn't great.
@_date: 2014-09-16 09:38:46
Can't you just have it directly deposit into your account, rather than to your card?
@_date: 2014-12-06 01:24:36
I ordered mine on Bitcoin black friday. I can't wait to get it!
@_date: 2014-12-24 11:59:24
It's all handled within the Chrome application.
@_date: 2014-05-25 05:20:54
I live in Paris during the year, and I hate to break it to you, but there is almost nowhere I could find to spend Bitcoin. There is a thai restaurant on Coinmap, but didn't get around to going there.

They are mine. I want to transfer them out, but there is no way to do it.
It's ridiculous that they want to basically create a private network with tiny transactions and  where no one can use them for anything.
It just helps Xapo build their account base. Every  you send out is basically doing their marketing work for them.
What a total crock. It basically keeps these coins totally unusable and dormant.
@_date: 2014-06-19 04:38:26
Yes, don't go into any specifics or anything...

There is no standard value. It has a trading value.
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:25:08
While I totally agree with the sentiment of welcoming more women into the community, the taking your ball and going home just because they won't implement some unenforceable dictum or "standards" seems weird to me.
By having something written down for one 3 day conference  actually going to stop harassment? There has to be a better way to communicate standards of a community, and actually welcome more women in than depending on these sorts of things to solve the problems of sexism.
The great thing about the Blockchain is that it doesn't give a shit who you are, what your sex is, or where you come from. We're a diverse and global community.
@_date: 2015-01-30 22:28:31
Dude posts this stuff to get hits. Stop falling for the bait.
@_date: 2015-01-29 22:54:00
Predictable. Another oligarch "charitable" wank.
@_date: 2015-01-23 15:19:20
I don't understand what the incentive is to buy bitcoin on the service. Why buy coins for $290 when I can just buy them on an exchange?
@_date: 2015-01-31 12:50:17
Interesting concept. Not too sure about the interface design. I currently have a Ledger.
I think the killer Hardware wallet is about integration with NFC with merchants, and that will take time. Plus, I don't think Apple allows NFC other than for ApplePay, so it will be through Bluetooth.
But ultimately Ledger does what I need it to do. A connivance way to separate my private keys from the network. A software hot wallet is fine for everyday spending.
Though, how do the trader feel about this? Is it compelling from a security standpoint? The problem is that if you are a trader, you keep your coins on the exchanges anyway due to quick transaction times between fiat.

If anyone knows, where is the best place to buy in France? Does Coinbase connect to French bank accounts?

So, if he had a economics degree, with emphasis in currency markets from Montana State University, then you would be satisfied?

Is there a currency trading subreddit?

I'd like to sign up, but it doesn't support my American bank for some odd reason.
@_date: 2014-05-22 19:33:20
No. That is why I was confused. I didn't backup.
I have restored from the seed before, though, when I switched browsers.
@_date: 2015-01-26 19:35:08
Dude, stop pumping this troll.
@_date: 2017-01-24 14:40:51
Just curious. I haven't bought on Purse in awhile, and saw that the discounts are not as good as they used to be.
Is there any reason for this? 
@_date: 2015-04-28 23:06:00
Which site do you use for 50%?
@_date: 2015-04-27 03:24:43
Yes, I am going to send mine to Nepal. Actually, I introduced a man from Katmandu who runs a charity for children there to Bitcoin. Let me see if I can find his info.
@_date: 2015-04-28 23:05:24
Love the site, guys. 
But I have been getting a bunch of cancellations recently because the sellers on Amazon change their prices so much. I know there's not much you can do about that behavior, but it's been frustrating not getting my orders picked up.
@_date: 2015-03-31 23:18:15
Is the app just for authentication, like Authy?
@_date: 2015-02-15 16:10:29
If you say so.

And here I was expecting someone proposing Bitcoin+ or SJWCoin. (The blockchain is patriarchy, etc...)
But he's right, cryptography is the sexiest part. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 09:12:07
I think the problem isn't you, it's that Xapo requires personal info for payout. I had a Xapo wallet before, and it worked fine, but now they require extra info.
@_date: 2015-02-15 15:40:21
Actually, I've been thinking for a long time that the dumb Bitcoin Foundation could actually do some outreach in the real world. You know, do their jobs to promote and educate.
Funding a forrest would be good, but the question is how this would be administered, and how we could insure of the results.
If this were to happen and succeed, we would need the press release to read "Bitcoin funds a forrest." There would need to be a partnership with an existing tree charity that is known to actually plant trees, rather than pay for parties.
It would also be good if the place was a specific place, rather than just throwing money at a problem.

Well, how about a copyright/ verification idea for artists. Allowing them to verify their work's existence and register on the blockchain. Right now, you have to register copyright in all the different countries.
Ownership of assets. Though, I'm sure people are working on this.
A Bitcoin "pot" for gaming tournaments for games. People pay in to enter, and winner takes all, or the winnings can be subdivided and automatically sent to addresses once the games have been one. More for online games like Hearthstone, etc... You buy a "ticket" in Bitcoin which gives you access, and then the winnings can be transparent on the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-02-03 19:17:40
Am so sold on the idea of stock that is verified by a blockchain. It will be property that is verified, and can't be fudged by those who want to manipulate the system to their benefit.

I think we have a winner.

Hahaha. Actually, I didn't. I was checking my account today, I saw it, and thought, "who on earth would appreciate this?" And to reddit bitcoin I came! :D

I'm in Shanghai. I have Bitcoin. I would love to be abel to spend them at a bar, or restaurant, or to pay for shoes or whatever, but as far as I know, there aren't businesses that accept it.
If anyone knows of a place, drinks are on me! :)
