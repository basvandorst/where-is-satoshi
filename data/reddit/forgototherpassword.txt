In around 2 weeks, the announcement will be made for what was $64 million, then $90 million to be returned to the market, at a much lower price.
Someone will be buying that.

Seriously, it was at 170k to 175k all yesterday. Are there any anomolies that you vets see? Extra "can't figure out address" or lots of junk transactions? When I was watching yesterday, Every time there was a block, TXs would flood in, then slow at 175k until around 176k. Maybe it was just the site, but it was consistent as hell.
If they know they'll get 4-9BTC in fees, they can waste 2-7 and still make $32k per block. If they're a large miner, they know they'll hit multiples a day.

It's just rhetoric for different kind of big government. Another way to bankrupt the people. Do you want to fund lots of people with a goal but *just not quite enough motivation* to get it done themselves, or do you want to vote for war. Either way the majority of your (tax) money is going to be spent on things that don't actually benefit you or those around you.

I'm not a fan of the country coins, but I understand.
One of the reasons that Doge is popular is that you can mine a few thousand over a week or 2 with a low end video card . If you give everyone in a country say 10 coins, people will start to collect them. Some will be like "wtf is this? and effectively throw them out. They will gain value because of the collectors and will become more attractive to others.
If you give everyone in a country .08 of a coin (BTC) far more people will have the reaction, because it is easier to deal in wholes and larger numbers than fractions. Groups of people are dumb. Sometimes you have to deal with the reality of the situation over best solution.

You missed some of it too. Josh Wise showed how great of a driver he actually is. He has embraced our community and chatted with us, hung out with some of our "celebrities" (or whatever you would call them). By the end it felt like rooting for your cousin or old friend.
This was bigger than -just- a sponsorship. Our absurdity made it so much more.

His philosophy is based on actual human condition/reaction. He's not so much idealist as realist.
Allowing the market to correct itself is something that WILL work, most just don't like the pitchfork torch side. They prefer the government regulated and government protected fraud "side".

I'm not Okay with it, it's just the best solution for the current problem. I don't know Vircurex's history, but what they are doing should work, based on Poloniex (if they don't screw it up). If Poloniex was holding 2BTC of mine I'd probably be upset, but they made a mistake and are working to correct it. They didn't disappear with what was left.
Also, I've only been doing this a few months, so I'll take it as lesson learned. At least it wasn't a total Gox wash. Anyone who saw a problem with their history and kept storing their coins on the site, has no right to complain. This solution will still get them theirs back though. I dump coins in, trade them, then withdraw. I'm not leaving large amounts on the exchange.

1- As usual with Crypto chain forks, approaching an update, the coin jumps massively in price on hype. Segwit2x failed, leaving all the new hype transactions building at the peak moment. Then when people realized their hype died, they tried to get out. BCH started going up because it became more profitable to mine and Bitcoin was stuck. 40% of Bitcoin's hashrate went to BCH due to profitability which furthered the issue. People became scared and all tried to dump out at the same time to get into BCH. A couple of jokers decided to throw tiny transactions back and forth, just for the lulz.
2- At least one large mining operation in league with/is a whale with exchange bots, manipulated the entire thing due to Segwit2x hype and BCH rise on the illusion of miners saying screw bitcoin we're going to the old chain, just so they could ride both tides and dump losses with full knowledge. (Clogging the chain to make bitcoin look worse while raking profits from BCH and buying 20% off BTC before it corrected)

Sell off 70%. Move to a State with Low housing cost. Buy a nice house in a good neighborhood and on sturdy land. Save enough to cover taxes. Buy a reliable car for each of you under $35k (future repair costs in mind)
This will be the best investment for you could make. You said you are bad with money. Purchase a house you can afford the taxes on yearly. Once you **OWN** a house, you can bag groceries for the rest of your lives. You can both find jobs you like and never have to worry again.
Don't tell anyone what you have. Remember your wife has claim to half of that (depending on local marriage laws). 
Be helpful and loving, but don't waste your fortune. No splurging/parties/handouts.
You won. Now you just have to do it.
