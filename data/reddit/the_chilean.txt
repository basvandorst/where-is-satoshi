everything is basically backed by bitcoin. if bitcoin moves, every cryptocurrency move along with it
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:35:03
lol great example
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:33:36
yes. great majority of markets are priced in btc. others pairings are also depending on bitcoin price themselves. if hypothetically bitcoin goes down 90% and no market transaction is done on an X alt, X alt also goes down 90% against USD
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:52:07
so did you buy?

decentralised exchanges are a thing expected to become big this year. they operate on smart contracts
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:20:56
it does not need to be, but it's the way it is so far.. some exchanges support USD pairing but their volumes are low, unless you use USDT but it's still a cryptocurrency
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:47:39

@_date: 2017-12-05 15:13:56
actually i got the mortgage  approved but not yet given. p2p means that i will be buying directly from a person (well known person in local conmunity) i think you should find some early bitcoin investor maybe in a local facebook bitcoin community

I live in chile and if I retire at 35 ( and live till 90 that'll mean 660 months so 2,575 USD per month it's actually a very good life. of course fiat will depreciate but would buy real estate to avoid that
Btw do you think BTC is gonna be lower than todays worth in 7 years time? I find it unlikely...
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:38:09
took out a $3k loan last Friday to jump into cryptos
I regret it... not making it $10k

Why would someone be so sure BTC would hit ATH again... Nothing is forever and past behaviour is not a real signal of future results.

I think the best way is actually finding an investor to hand you a case with cash.. like in the movies. also you'd avoid gains tax
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:47:26
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:26:01
im going to do the same

if youre not selling then why would you be buying? post-apocalypsis?

@_date: 2017-11-28 18:55:53
im doing so
btc $100,000 by 3 years
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:24:05
I hope so, I'm doing a nosedive decision onto it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:04:21
i convinced my dad, he's 74, we live in chile and i convinced him about bitcoin. he ironically used to hate technology. He's "selling me" a property (to show banks I need the loan) so I can put a 20% of it in bitcoin, so losing wouldnt be too terrible. but it's a gamble worth trying. much worse is going to college and be in debt forever, with a crappy job. he used to be military too! from air force (pilot)
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:17:03
yeah better off using a crypto card like tenx or mco

or keep losing...

@_date: 2017-11-03 16:17:09
what if you set  a stop loss and the crash happens so fast your order isnt even taken?
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:55:28
im actually gonna take a mortgage loan for bitcoin. im bored to death of my job. either glory or misery I accept the gamble
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:07:46
bitcoin ath or not you will never lose yoyr money. buy asap or regret
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:37:38

i hope to see again
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:29:37
yes that's true.
for me being a millionaire is like having 1.56 million usd though, that'd make 1 billion chilean pesos.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:48:23
im so glad it's taking ages to take my mortgage out the bank so i could have purchased bitcoin and hopefully retired in 3-6 years
im not certain now about its future
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:06:49
that's awesome. I wish I knew about bitcoin earlier. I would have nose dived on it

@_date: 2017-11-05 17:40:10

the feeling must be much worse for those who owned now millions but sold cheap or lost them than those who didnt have btc at all
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:46:36
talking to millionaires seems so normal now lol
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:31:36
get a crypto pre pay visa credit card such as monaco or tenx. they hand you the card as anonymous and can buy things and tell tax to fuck off
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:12:40
they will use oxygen to cut them if they look too big since theyll assume they contain something important
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:37:00

bitcoin is finite
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:09:30
there are decentralised exchanges such as etherdelta and bitshares but they dont buy for fiat money 
the best way to ghost money is actually using cash and buying from a person... like drug dealer movies

@_date: 2017-11-28 21:05:44
first off, read 
also read the history of each crash, for example mtgox in 2013 
and learn about ethereum and smart contracts!
and beware of ICO's, 90% are scam!
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:08:52
id sell if spiked 33% in 24hrs though
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:05:02

r/chile also hates cryptocurrency. Once I asked about cryptos they just downvoted me and told me it was a horrible idea. I have tendency of going against the tide so that made me actually take a bank loan and quadruple it in a couple of months. I laugh at them now.

yeah im totally convinced btc will at least reach 100k in less than 4 yrs. a lot % of global wealth is going to end up in btc because it's safer.

bitcoin is technically bad for payments. it's more for a storage of wealth rather than payment. just one tx is taking a week of typical home usage of energy. and fees are not good at all for small txs
bch and xvg are way better in those regards

This is in Chile and it's actually not a residential property, but it's going to be $80k. (20% ish) I think it's a good amount to live off after hodling 5-7 years. We actually just talked and he wants to sell it for 250M Chilean pesos ($395k USD) Now I'm wondering whether to put it all in BTC or some 20% in NEO and have dividends (GAS).

I found/ u/kupsi comment by going to Bitcoin-talk's "Speculation" forum to see what they actually envisioned 5 years ago and found that. Maybe in the future they are going to do the same in 5-7 years more. 
The more I study about BTC and its history, the more faith I have in it.

Thanks! We are selling a property and will put at least 25% of it on BTC for long term!

@_date: 2017-10-12 21:05:39
me and my dad are going to make a big investment, do you expect a correction after fork? This ATH seems too high to get in now.
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:07:46
5 years would be enough for proper retirement I guess :P
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:07:12
I'm gonna get a $80k loan falsely 'purchasing' a property of my dad. HODL strong. brcause fuck it. I don't wanna work till im 65 
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:45:48

@_date: 2018-02-12 11:02:22

@_date: 2017-10-31 21:45:20
I'm just In since this year (August) 2013 - 2015 HODL is the dark ages. Whoever HEDL deserves my utmost admiration!

@_date: 2017-10-12 21:52:52
I know about the top coins. But for big money I'd only go BTC. Most top coins don't survive in the long-term.
Bitcoin is the Coca-Cola of cryptos. May not be the best one, but it will always be the n° 1 and will always exist.

Hi Mark,
What's your personal hypothesis of who Satoshi Nakamoto is/was/are/were?
@_date: 2017-07-29 18:58:16
Bro do you even know me?
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:14:54
dude, origin doesnt even support multiple drives 0/10 wouldn't recommend
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:55:32
Wow. Sure sounds the only reliable way. But I think you can do versioning with cloud services.

@_date: 2017-07-26 19:26:03
Yea I've installed graphs on my phone and have live widgets for btc, eth, xtr. Seems everything's going down I guess due to august 1st. im waiting to hit valley and make purchase of my first investment. I've read you need to learn to HODL and that I should wait for some years. Seems cryptos might even replace fiat sometime in decades time.  And we are the early players. Cheers for the info though!!!������
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:13:23
Hi, I'm new to cryptos. I currently don't hodl any BTC. Barely 0.35 ETH. What should I do today? purchase some BTC or wait after August?
I wanna be a long-term hodler so I can retire at 35 (I'm 27) and plan to invest 25-33% of my salary in cryptos. Any BTC veteran to recommend me something?
Thanks everyone :)
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:42:07
Do you mean cryptos are going to deflate?
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:00:42
So can I make myself rich if I invest $15k in BTC today and ~~wait~~ HODL 10 yrs?
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:22:39
im taking a course in cryptos in coursera. I think fiat are going to burst in some decades time
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:25:01
best long term way to keep a wallet?
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:13:51
what about software wallet backuped in multiple cloud services and emails under encrypted containers such as rar, 7z?
@_date: 2017-07-29 20:23:41
and get a  1x cdrom reader ��
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:20:45
You think so? I'd bet 30% my wages if what you say is true
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:23:48
better platforms? which ones? please don't tell me origin ��
@_date: 2017-07-31 04:40:03
fuck paypal and ebay fuck them well fucked
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:39:59
seems no one will believe us and we'll keeping regretting every time BTC surges
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:59:51
That's actually been my logic since they cost $100... You don't know how regretful I feel now. Well, not 30% but I could spend 10% if that sounds less insane. I'm debt-free and will inherit some property so such loss wouldn't leave me on the streets anyways. Actually 10% of my salary it's still a lot for what total spending in USD would be in 5 years time if cryptos skyrocketed tenfoldish again... Well enough for letting me live a good life without working. I live in Chile btw.
