You are so afraid to be downvoted you won't even spell BCH properly. How pathetic is that

bitcoin cash has 10minutes transaction wait time and ~0.1$ for transaction, just saying
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:41:36
I wonder why
@_date: 2017-08-30 08:47:16
that feel when you start a thread entirely for the purpose of calling bch bcash :D
@_date: 2017-08-30 10:17:37
write bcash but read it bitcoin cash, golden logic

You should start seeing bitcoin as digital gold.
Gold is the best measure of value/work that we can exchange/trade. It's rare and limited. But it's very hard to send gold instantaneously via wires. Well, with bitcoin it becomes possible. So your fears are completely invalid.

Nope, just calling out cowards as I see them. You can ignore me from now. Don't get too angry though

bitcoin core hijack goes downhill now OFFICIALLY :) \o/
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:12:26
Bitcoin Cash is doing fine though. Why do you limit yourself to the classic bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:38:30
What? I'm simply pointing out that if OP sets lower fees the transaction will get stuck for who knows how long (usually days) yet you are suggesting to do that? what kind of advice is that?
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:33:17
elaborate maybe? I think it's a pretty solid version of bitcoin, low fees, fast tx, just like in old times.
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:34:13
if you chose lower fees OP's transaction will get stuck for days if not weeks. Not the best advice
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:40:44
You are way too lucky then. Try that 5 times, 4 out of 5 your transaction will almost vanish.
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:00:45
Yes, it’s called Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:42:09
same can be said about classic bitcoin atm. Everybody is buying it as a stored asset. You can't buy anything with it due to high fees and long tx times. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:30:25
Check out Bitcoin Cash, it's an improved version of Bitcoin where transaction costs few cents (!) and transaction time is less than 10 minutes. Currently it's around $500 but growing as well as BTC
Also, mods will delete my post so I hope you had time to see this before it vanishes 
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:34:52
BitPay is going to accept it in coming months
@_date: 2017-09-11 12:17:53
tx cost
tx time
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:07:35
It became more profitable to mine it. More wallets adapting it, and as I sawore people are switchingg from btc to bch because of lower tx fees and tz time (4$ vs 0.1$) 
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:24:16
Bch is already more profitable to mine
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:22:56
Why not just use bitcoin  cash? Jesus...
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:30:35
thank you for illustration

the amount of hatred and mockery towards other opinions in this subreddit is depressing
@_date: 2017-07-28 08:00:01
You guys seem to be obsessed with BCC. Downvotes will prove my point.
@_date: 2017-07-14 11:15:45
each block originally has 1MB limit. transactions are getting slower and fees are getting bigger due to many transactions competing to be in the block. the more fee you pay the more likely the nodes will channel your transaction.
it was proposed by some parties to increase this block size. some say we need very big blocks some say we should be careful with that because the bigger the block the more likely it is to cheat.
currently btc is being torn apart, similar to what happened with ethereum
