Is there any news for a new hardware wallet to hit the market anytime soon besides Ledger/Trezor?
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:42:49
Is it only a Bitcoin wallet?

Thanks, mate. Always good to have some knowledge dropped.

Has anybody looked into Omni's team? They look like fake profiles, don't even list their last names. Just look at them 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:43:53
Yeah, I love my Ledger too. I might get a Trezor 2 when it comes out.

USAA bank isn't members only anymore, as of some 5 years ago. USAA insurance still is.

Here's another interesting parallel from the book about Le Roux:


months in Virginia Beach. In 1994, now twenty-one and back in London, Le Roux met an Australian
woman named Michelle and they started dating. A year later, he followed her to Sydney. She was brash and
swore like a sailor, according to his relatives, and they married in 1995. Le Roux picked up a variety of
contract programming jobs, gigs that gave him a window into the increasingly digital world of corporate
banking. At an Australian bank, he was hired to develop “credit process automation,” and to implement
software to simplify the SWIFT system for international bank transfers. At a travel software company, he
built accounting systems. For a Hong Kong brokerage, he created a system to automate the paperwork
associated with trading. All of it, intentional or not, was experience that would prove valuable in his more
entrepreneurial endeavors down the road.
Paul shows he also had extensive knowledge of cryptography and the banking software SWIFT.
