With every dramatic rise there is typically a 15-20% correction. Hope That Helps.

Typically it is more profitable for the average person to take the money they were going to use for a mining rig, and invest it in bitcoin.

"Being a 90 year old billionaire doesnt make you informed nor an expert."
Good thing I did not suggest that. I was referring to the actual experts.
I respect your perspective, but there are certainly experts who believe that BTC is in a bubble and vise versa.

Works pretty much the same as a traditional wallet. In the same way it is safer than keeping money in a privately owned bank. Though that isn't the greatest example because banks are much safer than exchanges due to regulations, and law. However I think it illustrates the point OK.
Basically it gives you much more control over the ownership and safety of your crypto.

There are many "informed experts" that say BTC is in a bubble and many that say the opposite.

I'm not disagreeing. I said typically there is, not every time.

In that case 100% on the ledger would be the safest.

1. You do not NEED a separate wallet for each type of currency, though sometimes it is necessary to have multiple wallets to cover an assortment of different cryptos.
2. The best type of wallet is a hardware or paper wallet. However when dealing with small amounts it is fairly safe to use Desktop, Mobile, or online wallets. Which type you use will depend on what features you need/want: Security, Ease of Use, UI, Types of Crytos, etc.
3. Futures Trading should not affect security.
4. Each time you access your wallet, no matter the type there is an added risk of compromised security. However, if you are safe when you go about it the risk will be minimal, or even non existent.
I hope that helps a little.

Clearly you are biased, or you just haven't done enough research.

By invest I mean simply buying an amount of bitcoin on an exchange and holding in a wallet.

Depends on what you are doing with your cryptos.
