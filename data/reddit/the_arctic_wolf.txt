Thank you!

Miners that were turned off are being turned back on because the higher price makes them viable again.

"Oversight and governance in the profitable management of a $5 billion financial trust." Reference to bitcoin market cap?

Go read the comments to any Zero Hedge article that mentions bitcoin. Some people still think this.
@_date: 2015-12-08 23:46:47
he's got a supercomputer in Iceland working on it apparently.

His wishlist includes sex pheromones cologne. Satoshi is kinky.
@_date: 2015-12-09 03:05:48
It's a public wishlist. I assumed it was included as a joke as everything else is about cryptography and computer science.
@_date: 2015-12-09 03:27:48
You left out the best part.
"Linguistic analysis is bloody useless at best, a dead end at worst.
Nick Szabo is not a good developer. There are many people with a rudimentary coding ability, but this is barking up the wrong tree."
Satoshi used the word bloody. This was referenced in many articles trying to figure out who Satoshi is, which I'm sure Dr. Craig read. Either part of the trolling or Satoshi dropping coy hints.

What if it's not arbitrary but based on real data and tests? We all want bitcoin to be globally adopted but have to make sure it doesn't break in the process.

He just said within 3 years, didn't say 2018.
@_date: 2016-01-23 01:08:01
It would be nice to have some certainty about that, I agree. I think they are waiting to see what kind of improvements can be made with block propagation times using weak blocks and/or IBLTs before committing to a certain block size.

Thanks, I learned a lot.
@_date: 2016-01-27 03:47:56
sweet! so only one more year until $10,000 btc! ;)
@_date: 2016-01-27 03:56:28
He said in the video within 3 years. Video is apparently from 2014.

North American Bitcoin Conference is there now, maybe some of them are already in Miami.

Which is why segwit is getting rolled out asap. :)
@_date: 2016-01-19 05:30:55
Another one to add to the list.

I'm still waiting for the $10 bitcorns I was promised.
@_date: 2016-01-20 01:29:29
Well, I know jack shit about cryptography and distributed systems so I'm sure as hell going to care about the opinion of the technical experts.
@_date: 2016-01-26 22:48:57
is just core developer bashing. Worse than ever was.
@_date: 2016-01-27 03:51:10
Everybody knows that the market should decide what the rocket boosters can handle. The engineers probably have a conflict of interest because they are paid...by a company.
@_date: 2016-01-22 20:36:36


Is it less risky and faster though? Most developers say a hard fork would take a year to responsibly deploy. SegWit should be ready around April. 
@_date: 2016-01-22 21:32:05


I believe you just answered your own question. And hard forks  require everyone to change at the same time. If you don't you can lose money.
@_date: 2016-01-28 18:01:24
11 is Gavin's favorite number, iirc. Probably had something to do with that as well.
@_date: 2016-01-21 19:28:52
They mention future increases in the roadmap. 2-4-8 re-scaled to account for segwit is a possibility.
@_date: 2016-01-22 21:43:27
I would refer you to this article that explains it better than I could:

"But in addition to making the SEC extra-cautious (and slow), a Bitcoin ETF also requires the proposal of a new SEC rule – a proposal that must be made by the exchange where the ETF will be traded.
Nasdaq never filed for such a rule change – but on Thursday the BATS exchange did.
Once filed, such a rule change must be posted for a period of public comment, usually 45 days (although the SEC can extend the period if it deems it necessary).
At the end of the 45-day period, the SEC can approve the rule or extend the period another 45 days. If the SEC feels it needs still more time, it can extend the period another 90 days, and another 60 days beyond that if need be.
So the good news for the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust is that now the clock is ticking. In theory the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF could get approval in August. The maximum period is 240 days, which puts us at Feb. 24, 2017.
Of course, the SEC could also choose to reject the proposed rule change. That would delay the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF indefinitely."
