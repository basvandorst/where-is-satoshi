Ah gotchya.
Hey, do you know which nation is the best?
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:48:01
Right but what would a major exchange like coinbase do with my coins?
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:39:13
murdered by words

I'm up about $6 USD from my 5 trades I've attempted.
I'm basically a professional money person now and im pretty sure i've had two heart attacks since i started being one!
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:08:43
I panic sold this morning, it's like a donation I didn't mean to make!
You're welcome!
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:04:31
lol upvoted
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:00:01
So why not move it to something with less/no risk? What's the advantage of keeping it on this physical token?
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:39:42
BitStamp is nice, accepts SEPA banks for low/no fee and their servers didn't get crushed under the weight of the craziness last week.
blockchain.info for the wallet and deck your account out with security 2FA stuff.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:01:16
But it will only ever be for day traders if they don't add the functionality to MOVE bitcoin.
Right now the only option is to buy or sell bitcoin, you can't move them anywhere or give them to anyone.

... The Geneva convention.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:03:24
Basically yeah, you got it ya idiot :)
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:57:06
Exactly, I think a ton of people are thinking that they're buying from the exchange itself when they purchase bitcoin. Which isn't the whole truth, you're buying them FROM someone THROUGH the exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:29:49
Ill be drowning in paper work but have other incentives and overall they're taxed pretty similarly.
Anyways I won't trade enough to be considered a trader unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:32:53
No idea, they won't tell me. If you look on coinbase sub reddit, it's pretty common. I had two buy orders pending, went to make a third and my app started saying to log into the website. Logged in and it was an account closure page telling me i needed to remove all funds.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:35:35
You effectively told someone that it's their fault someone hacked them because they didn't do research on how they were going to be hacked.
It's stupid af and you're a dickhead.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:58:46
Cute story.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:59:17
Okay ill do it right here.
I bought what the millieniums call, avocado toast, instead of having ramen, thanks to bitcoin. I feel physically ill.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:33:52
You can cuss on reddit.
Fuck. Cunt. Shit.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:13:18
I wouldn't keep them on there long term sure.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:52:23
Besides the history of MtGox, and recent reveals that exchanges aren't dealing with their growing pains too well, whats the reasoning behind this?
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:36:54
Deimos, maybe even further.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:53:02
I was in and then got banned for "violating ToS" suddenly but never actually given a reason.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:04:13
I'm in the dog house :(
it's fine there are other exchanges out there
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:51:32
eh total im still down like $100 i think... i hope
kinda don't want to calculate it and feel that bad on a sunday 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:58:51
Whats happening is sell orders and buy orders being fulfilled so fast it looks ridiculous, but it's normal.
The computer is doing the fulfilling.
Mostly people doing the posting of the orders, but people can also setup a program to do it for them.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:17:38
That's the way to do it. I threw in a big chunk of change I was going to use to buy a new computer, and drop $100-$200 a month depending on how good I am about not spending on food and electricity which normally fluctuate anyways.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:32:53
That's up to coinbase if they want to fulfill the original order.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:05:20
So...we are the drunken monkeys? OH ... MY... GOD!
Selling all my bitcoins!
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:50:15
How does it compare to the meme market though? And when is it going to go up or crash, yea or no?
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:48:17
The future is no country for old men.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:04:26
Wait, arn't these exchanges insured?
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:34:52
Man ACH would be fantastic!
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:35:49
BitStamp is pretty good, only seen very minor lag.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:46:38
Harder daddy.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:15:01
This is a 24 hour cycle? Wouldn't that comparatively put it at like a 23-26k USD spike tomorrow?

I'm drunk and tired but what I think it means is that someone values something on top of the wall and all the buyers at the bottom don't want to climb it.
You're welcomefren!
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:46:04
So why did it end up like this? Is it the fault of the users or is it the fault of the currency and how it works?
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:49:30
Oh we don't eat in the bedroom, we sit at the table always. We don't drink at all until we've finished all our food and then finish one large class of iced milk each.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:55:55
Can you provide proof of any of this occurring?
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:09:08

Beef, it's whats for dinner.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:00:36
I highly doubt anyone would have a problem with that!
ONWARD AND UPWARD DEAR BRISKET!

Exchanging fiat for crypto to help a stranger on the internet eat his gf's meat? Oh my!

Weird I can't seem to access it

Satirical comics or political cartoons shouldn't be taken seriously because they're funny!
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:14:12
Some what? Trust me mate, I want the brisket.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:08:36
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:20:44
Okay so I signed up, bought bitcoin via ACH which said they'd be delivered on Dec 2nd about 20 hours later I got an account closure email out of no where.
I confirmed the buy well before account closure, and cannot complete account closure process despite all the steps being marked off as completed, including the one that says no pending activity.
I have no yet been charged but i've read of horror stories where peoples money disappeared for a month with nothing to show for it.
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:45:21
I've only had her brisket once and it was fantastic!
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:03:28
What really is bitcoin though?
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:12:28
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:32:52
I'm damned excited!
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:50:39
Must have been years ago at that cost, who pays 40k USD for nudes
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:51:42
Using that word makes you sound like a total tool.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:08:56
No time stamp, you'll just have to trust me 
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:36:41
Also because if it crashes, not only do I not get brisket, but she'll also chew my face off for encouraging her to buy finally.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:15:44
Especially if the GOP tax bill goes through... unless third times the charm on trickle down economics.
You'd think people wouldn't want to repeat the fuckin Great Depression but noooo we gotta fail it again and again.
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:04:45
My gf just invested right before the crazy week, but she said if it reaches 8k she's making me a whole brisket to myself.
C'mon guys I really want that brisket!
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:44:52
Need to download more dedodated wams!

You know it!
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:55:43
Okay, let's try this. 
How does that paint bitcoin in a bad light?
