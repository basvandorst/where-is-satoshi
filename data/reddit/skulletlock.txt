Good news, BitPay has solved this instance and tied the invoice to the the transaction ID that was accepted by the network.  Turns out the invoices use the initial transaction ID when payment goes through, so if the ID/ HASH is modified by whoever is doing this, it throws off the invoice payment confirmations for the merchant.  If this happens to anyone else just contact Bitpay support as suggested by helpful reply's, thanks!

Currently still havent returned the funds or credited my account, opened tickets with their support.  I am assuming it made it to them at the same address but the automated bitpay invoicing system isnt set up to catch instances like this because the original transaction ID was changed.  I'm just glad it was only like $28 but worried it could happen again with a larger purchase.

I sent the transaction from a Coinbase wallet android app, they applied fees from  
what I understand.   Here is a link to the transaction, of which occured 3 minutes after my original transaction that was apparently modified and later "pruned" off the network.  
 
I have a screenshot showing the unspent outputs, the original transaction was deleted pruned or whatever, but it shows up in the screenshot. 
Thanks
