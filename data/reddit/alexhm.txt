No. We increase the block size to give us breathing space.  Alts crash - BTC’s back, LN flying by 2019.  Now how hard is that?
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:26:09
Don't be ridiculous.  We already know 90% of the miners at least were willing to support a 2x increase.  If core were to release a version with a future blocksize increase, uptake would be easily 95% plus across all nodes, mining or not.  That is not a contentious hard fork.  It's easy.
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:19:51
I think you are missing the point - this is mission accomplished for Core.  That’s not FUD, the clear aim of their plan is to force on-chain “low value” transaction use cases to be reduced.  Greg Maxwell will be opening another bottle of champagne.

Looking at his later comments, I think I spotted the troll. I agree you answered respectfully and you are, of course right - but I agree that any influx of slightly more efficient miners may have a minuscule effect until the next DA.

I disagree. Personal responsibility should be paramount.  Insurance is a way to offset thar.  As is goodwill.  Government has a role protecting those incapable of protecting themselves.  But if I take precautions, and think about my relationship with the receiving partner carefully, and act accordingly; why should I subsidise those that don’t.
These days, if I move a.full BTC, I check and recheck the address from unconnected devices; I use a Trezor and check the address on the Trezor.I might send a smaller amount first etc.
For small amounts I send it from my hot wallet on  my phone with no concern.
Bill almost gets it - but still doesn’t quite.  Trust lessness comes with responsibility and this is a good thing.

You are still new.  We had two as big as this after China shut down exchanges in Jan/Feb last year.  And they pale into insignificance vs 2013.  You really should go into this, even as a BTC believer, expecting that the same will happen again.  It could be happening now.
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:00:37

I use a Trezor.  I stored the seed in a safety deposit box and I sent the passwords that protect the accounts to my parents in a letter to be opened in the event.....
Finally - make sure you have 10% of your crypto stored in an alternative password  on the hardware wallet to guard against a $5 wrench attack.  If they sit you down and force you to unlock it you can give them the 10% password and hopefully they will leave happy.

Dumbass is too harsh - but you still haven’t grasped it.  Even if people fork the chain - it really just splits the value like a stock split.  The new coins may have an intrinsic value in the long term - but only one will ever be bitcoin - determined by consensus and hashrate together.
I don’t think you have any idea how costly it would be to break that consensus and hashrate now more costly than mining a bit more gold...
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:12:46
Yes I realise it is open source.  I also realise that the commits are accepted (or otherwise) into the release by a small group of core developers who are therefore responsible for evolution of the project.  
If the software is not being adopted, it could be because they're releasing the wrong software.

@_date: 2017-12-20 22:14:04
Yes; if only it had reasonable fees it would be a sure fire winner.  Double the fucking blocksize.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:50:22
Yes - and that's the opposite of my scenario but... There are a lot of long term hodlers in BTC who are overweight BTC versus other cryptos and fiat (on most views of the world).  My scenario is a win/win for them.  Yours could happen but it is less likely that an outside investor would see that as a dead cert win.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:15:14
How high will fees have to rise before Core do something?  
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:16:59
Robust, resilient, but useless.  How much of BTC is now locked in UTXO addresses that cannot be used?  How much is acceptable?  
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:47:26
Yes - by the look of these charts,  it's going to be quite a while.  
So we'll just have to accept exponentially rising fees.  Shame.
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:48:02
I'm sure you have read the other responses - but to be clear; Coinbase haven't done anything wrong here.  They just credited you with your BCH as is right.  Multiple exchanges (Kraken for example) allow you to buy BTC with BCH.  I would consider keeping the BCH if I were you.  It may increase in value as low value use cases migrate from BTC to BCH.  In that way it is hedge against BTC becoming increasingly expensive to use.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:51:23
Eerrrmmm...  $20 fees and massive congestion...  perhaps?

Double the blocksize,.  Do it now before it is too late.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:32:35
It will prompt greater transaction volume, but I don't see any evidence that it will rise massively.  Vendor adoption has been damped now, so I think we'll effectively see people using it for settlement, not payment - but with low fees.  Perfect.  JFDI.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:41:54
Double the blocksize now you intransigent fools.  Do it now before it's fucked.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:16:26
It just occurs to me that the opposite scenarios could be caused by hedge and institutional funds needing to buy in to get exposure and leveraging up to make it a double whammy.  Given the increased publicity, that is a possible scenario.  Either way, I'm not sure it's going to improve stability...
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:10:20
Scale of users only.  But even with a linear increase in use, the fees rise exponentially.  This is why Core insist on a second layer solution - which is right in the long run - but totally fucked up while the system can easily scale to 10 times what it does now for NO REAL COST!
@_date: 2017-02-11 10:17:41
I bought another BTC straight after the crash.  Actually the fact that upwards direction is so predictable may be a weakness.  When/if the ETF launches it is going to be insane.
@_date: 2017-02-05 10:57:15
Clearly; there is no point getting pissed off at the miners.  You need to work with them.  The offer to scale the blocks then implement segwit was sensible.  Can you take BU and incorporate the changes to allow LN?  I'd give up trying to fight a hard fork.  It was misguided anyway.
@_date: 2017-02-05 11:12:27
They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.

Sorry mate; Do you do logic?  "Y is an essential property of X" implies "If X does not have property Y, it is no longer X".  This does not imply "If Z does not have property Y, it is X";  otherwise everything that doesn't have property Y would be X.  
So according to your logic, my recently deceased pet dog who does not have SHA256 based Proof of Work, is also Bitcoin.  Good; Because despite recent warnings to the contrary, Bitcoin is not yet dead and I miss the furry little mongrel.

@_date: 2017-03-21 11:06:24
Assuming, since he shared it, that he does agree with the majority of the sentiments, a successful approach would be to suggest the following : 
 
Immediate on-chain scaling to buy some time for Bitcoin to grow further.  Then implement SegWit (or at least the malleability fix) to allow developers the time to build more functional second layer solutions in time for the next halving.  If, with bigger blocks and SegWit we can provide the room to grow the transaction throughput by a factor of 10 in that time the price should follow.  We should then be in a position for miners to benefit from a much higher number of lower fees  (that equates to say 25-100 times higher fee income overall) by the time that halving happens.  With BTC more embedded, the miners will be more secure that the existing network can pay their way.
 
So can we do it now?
@_date: 2017-03-04 14:52:16
Please can you explain what you think IS causing the unconfirmed txn count.  Please don't say 'insufficient fees' because that is not the case.  If everyone paid 10 times what they currently do, the backlog would be the same.

Probably as a result of my terrible grammar.  I just bought about 2 BTC in the current dip; I now have just over 21.  Now the ETF will probably get rejected and I'll lose 25%.  I'll still hold on for a return to profit later in the year.   Or if it gets approved there will probably be a massive spike followed by a massive drop!

I don't buy this.   The success or failure of Bitcoin is based on socioeconomic factors, game theory and psychology.  If you think programmers have any special insight into getting the "right" answer than the wisdom of the crowd, you are sorely mistaken.
Having said that, I'm not sure the miners are in any better position, but personally I would lay my bets that satoshi got it right and go with "his" consensus.
@_date: 2017-01-02 16:28:37
It almost doesn't matter they have an exchange.  They'll HAVE to buy BTC at whatever price to issue creation units in sync with the inflows that will be spurred by the increasing price or close trading.  If they do that, it looks really bad.  I guess they've already bought the 20,000 they need from the seed money, but unless they've built a huge buffer, it could get very messy.  
Maybe I'm worrying unnecessarily - and those of us who've got a few in cold storage can sit back and watch our net worth fly...
If I had to guess though; If they haven't got arrangements in place, we could see a massive spike and a huge capitulation when they have to close the fund.

@_date: 2017-01-03 07:12:04
Yes - agreed.  But it might be possible for the early adopters to torpedo it if they decide to cash out.  My judgement - based on the hope I mentioned above is that they won't.  We also may be at the point where BTC would survive anyway.  There's a lot of sunk cost in those mining farms...

The difficulty of arbitrage is just part of the story.  That explains why the gap doesn't close.  It doesn't explain why it's there in the first place.  I suspect two underlying reasons; A false exchange rate, bolstered by the Korean government; greater capital controls in Korea leading to a desire to circumvent them.
IMHO these are the factors that guarantee success for Bitcoin in the future.

@_date: 2017-08-24 02:02:42
And just to clarify.  I run my full node on a six year old laptop - and the bandwidth it uses is dwarfed by my kid's use of YouTube, Snapchat etc,  I don't. know why you think the resources required by SegWit2x would be a problem - but I assure you that it wouldn't be for 99% of nodes right now.  I agree visa size scaling would cause issues (although I also think there are other solutions to that).  Either way, SegWit is now activated so if LN is all you think it is, we don't need to worry long tern.  
Like I said - everyone wins if core implement 2x compatibility rather than playing the brinkmanship games they are.

Yes; it's one of the things that gives me hope this isn't just a well disguised pyramid scheme.  You had to be smart to get in - and not just smart in a psychopathic way.  I've seen the types of people that those schemes attract.  The successful ones tend to be dumb salespeople - attractive, superficially charming and vapid with a inner lack of humanity.  Almost (!) an antithesis of the nerd crowd driving BTC.
Mind you - it could still be a bubble that may burst - although my bet is that inner core has value that will attract use and investment in the long run.
@_date: 2017-01-02 16:32:30

My observation is that anyone who dehumanises a complicated group of individuals into a single, derogatory term is either a) iredeemiably stupid b) trolling or c) a teenager.   There probably are a small number of people who just want BTC to fail.  Most of the people you are characterising as "Buttcoiners" do not.

@_date: 2016-12-23 19:48:58
You can't seriously believe they're trying to destroy bitcoin?  This looks like trolling.  You must realise they just believe, for many good reasons, that more capacity would be good for bitcoin.

Move your coins out of Coinbase to a hardware wallet.  Keep the 24 word phrase completely secure - a safety deposit box or safe at a parents house is good (even better if you split it in half and keep it in two locations) - and the hardware wallet safe - ideally a fireproof safe at home.
For complete cold storage, move them to a paper wallet and store that in a safety deposit box.

Unless you are stupid, blind or ignorant, you must already realise that off-chain solutions and some kind of fee market will be necessary in the long run.  The questions is: What do we do now?  Centralisation by high processing/storage/bandwidth for validation and transmission is not a major fact up to, say 20MB.  Do it now and deliver the side chain technology in the couple of years of breathing space.  BTC is too young to stifle it now.  That is what big-blockers are saying.

I think it's fairly simple.  BTC has just ruled out a bunch of use cases that would have been possible with lower fees.  Those use cases are now likely to move to BCH - at least until the LN is 'ready'.  I suspect BCH will continue to take market share until low fee transaction need is met.

It's difficult to tell, as an outsider.  If I was trying to kill bitcoin, I might choose to limit its growth rather than an all out attack.  If you were kill it outright, something else is likely to take its place.  
If you were to artificially limit its transaction throughput and so drive up fees, damping adoption, that might be the best way to maintain the status quo for governments and banks.

Ok.  So he mentioned EB - but that is not incriminating.  Adam was quite keen on them a couple of years ago.   dishonest /008356.html
Maybe Purse heard this as part of their brainstorming....  don't know, but I'm not inclined to believe they are dishonest - and despite a lot of noise, I haven't seen anything to indicate anything other than they are trying to fix a problem as best they can.

What you guys have missed is that Xapo is also the custodian for GBTC.  It's a done deal....  Core better launch a 2x compatible client soon or they will really be made irrelevant.

The two things are not incompatible.  That's the bleeding point.  Working in their own best interests, they provide security to Bitcoin.  Having that empty block harms no-one,really.  Imagine that block propagation was instantaneous.  Everyone would be waiting 30 seconds to validate the previous block and assemble the next one.  Mining an empty block in that period has very few downsides, as validating an empty block should be almost instantaneous.  If miners are smart, they shouldn't have to start assembling the next block from scratch; just increment the block height and update the prev block hash and mine it.  
No harm, no foul - and they get 12.5 BTC for it.  who wouldn't? 
I find it interesting that people on this sub try to use this to illustrate why miners are evil and not acting in the best interests of Bitcoin.  Those that do really miss the point.  
@_date: 2017-05-09 06:57:52
It's a good step forward.  In my view the risk premium in giving up your keys to a third party needs to be much higher, at least for the next few years.  There is too long a track record of institutions getting hacked to give them up for 5% pa.
@_date: 2017-05-09 06:49:26
That's how most people in the US buy into crypto.  Then lots of churn on the other exchanges.  That provides a premium.  I just asked that question and this is the answer that made most sense.
I got most of mine from localbitcoins as it was easier to do bigger deals.  I always go back there to get a "real" price.  It tracks the lower exchanges mostly.
@_date: 2017-05-08 08:24:26
I'll take that as a "yes", then.

A) funny that you think 'normie' is an insult.
B) Conflating relativism with equality is another lazy and dumb assumption.
C) if there is any direction to moral philosophy it is self evidently away from reactionary conservatives like you.  
All in all, you are just creating a straw man out a fringe element so that you can get angry with them - because you have been manipulated to do so by a political group of far right politicians to whom you are a useful schmuck.
You're not a new dawn; you're just another throwback who'll be dismissed by history, but probably only after making the world a worse place for a few years like the other servile fodder for populists before you.

So - speaking honestly is a problem?
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:15:33
I think they're just creating a backup BTC in case core manage to block 2x.  In which case they'll mine empty blocks on the SegWit chain until it dies - but keep BCC going until all the exchanges move to it.  I don't blame them.
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:23:15
Marxist?  Wtf?i you may want to do a bit of research.  Assuming someone who sees sexism in everything is Marxist is as dumb as the original triggering.  You're as bad as each other.
@_date: 2017-07-27 06:48:34
'Read the discussions'.  That's where you are going wrong.  Look at a) the hash power b) when you actually get the economic players together, as in NY, the true views of the community become clear.  In reality, a small group of developers who think they own bitcoin are trying to impose their views on everyone else.  It is clear they will fail this time. 2x is happening.  Core should release a 2x compatible client ASAP so that they can continue to contribute.  Otherwise, they will be forked off - which in my view would be bad for BTC.
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:36:20
They're creating a backup BTC in case core manage to block 2x. If it doesn't happen, they will kill SegWit coin by mining empty blocks and mine full blocks on BCC until it becomes the defacto Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-07-27 11:28:09
Agreed.  But that is a function of electricity cost and first mover advantage.  Actually - the capability to design and build ASICS is in many places - and I suspect the electricity cost advantage will probably even out over time due to normal economic pressures.  As bitcoin goes more mainstream, there will also be benefits to other enterprises with deep pockets - corporates and governments - starting to mine to reduce their exposure to China.
One thing is certain - limiting blocksize is not really an important factor.
@_date: 2017-07-24 07:42:47
Most users I know want bigger blocks and are prepared to put in SegWit2x to keep you guys happy.  Please stop assuming your echo room is everyone.
@_date: 2017-07-29 10:02:46
That's all part of the fun.  Nobody seems to know what to think about Bitcoin cash, but it's looking like it might be between 500-700USD, which implies BTC should be that much lower.  On the other hand, getting the most rabid bog blockers off BTC might make it more likely that Core create their settlement layer so maybe the price should go up. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 15:09:27
When it's jumping around like this I always feel sorry for the newbies and easy marks.  I bet they're panic selling &amp; buying and getting taken for a lot of cash.  Calm down, settle in for the ride and wait for $3000.

I'm pretty sure the miners are going to do what they say they are going to do.  Rather than continuing spreading this FUD, wouldn't it be better for you to be preparing a core client that will accept the 2x hard fork for everyone to run?
Please get on board with what is a well intentioned, broad, honest consensus.

Social, business - normal human - behaviour.  Behave to others in the way you wish to be treated.  This "Machiavellian" approach has Failed.  The quotes are there because The Prince was supposedly good at this shit.  Core are not.
This is consensus and that involves compromise.  There is every reason to believe that people are acting honestly, in both their best interest and what they believe is the best interest of the Bitcoin community.  Try believing it for a bit.

@_date: 2017-06-23 18:59:55
So conspiracy theory for conspiracy's sake.  Maybe Occam's razor would be useful here.  It's not that unlikely that the miners want a blocksize increase and are prepared to compromise and accept SegWit as long as they get it.
If only core was equally open to compromise - then we could get past the stupid bloody impasse.
@_date: 2017-05-21 11:07:32
$2000 on 21st May...
@_date: 2017-06-23 19:09:35
Because they clearly don't believe that SegWit really delivers that scaling they want.  They probably also want to prove that Hard Forks can work, so that it is added back into the toolkit for the future.

Yes.  I know who he is.  I'm not a troll.  I'm part of a majority of miners, BTC organisations, hodlers and users who want bitcoin to flourish.  You (and Theymos) represent one of the two extremes who are in danger of fucking it up.

Lots of negative views on Coinbase.  They are struggling to scale with their user on boarding rate but I think they're pretty sound apart from that.
They signed up to the New York Agreement, though - which I see as a positive.  
@_date: 2017-06-24 09:44:28
Yep.  The total value that can be extracted by shorting and killing it is limited - nowhere near the potential upside.  And very short term.
@_date: 2017-06-22 22:28:49
I am genuinely surprised that such a momentous event - almost 90% miner support for a scaling solution isn't all over the front page.  SegWit by itself seemed to be dominating the first few pages until very recently.
Anyway - good to know that the mods let it through.  
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:25:16
If you look at the extremists from btc "Never SegShit!" and bitcoin "Never Hardfork! - We'll take SegWit from  NYA and renege on the deal!", it really starts to look like there are elements on both that are deliberately trying to sabotage bitcoin.  Previously I thought they were genuine actors with different opinions.
The majority wins this time.  BTC is nothing without the miners.  If core won't support the blocksize increase, the exchanges will go with the SegWit2x client (Coinbase and BTCC for example).  Corecoin will be an alt. 
It's a done deal - the loudest saboteurs are starting to sound shrill.  I can't wait until we don't have to listen to you anymore - from both sides.
@_date: 2017-06-22 22:32:12
Yes - I think given the strength of the movement, it would make sense for the core implementation to be SegWit2x compliant.  Given the only contentious bit about this is that the core implementation doesn't support it.
@_date: 2017-06-22 23:01:31
So it sounds like SegWit2x is ideal for you, then?  You would like core to update their client to be compliant?
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:54:44
Yep - understand  but I don't think POW change is practical :-(
I actually meant is nothing without the miners backing though; Now that they're signalling (kind of) 80% Segwit2x, any hope they had of killing SegWit is gone - unless the loons from scupper it by shouting that they will not follow the 2MB fork.

@_date: 2017-06-19 21:07:22
I think you need to get over this. 75% of hash rate is in total agreement with 50+ signatories of the NYA.  I would say that well over 50% of holders and users that I speak to agree.  SegWit + 2MB is happening.  Get on board or be prepared to lose. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 22:50:56
I think most "users" want a block size increase but I guess it depends on how you define "user".
Miner centralisation is a problem but a 1MB block increase probably won't impact that .  Surely cost of electricity is driving that?  
I'm banking on solar power and ASIC design/manufacturing to catch up and start making mining viable outside of China.  I don't think blocksizes of this scale are a factor.
@_date: 2017-06-23 05:16:36
I think they are signalling for the NYA;  they're just not signalling in a way that will automatically trigger SegWit2x yet.
@_date: 2017-06-01 13:31:59

There are plenty of reasons it could be uncharacteristic in this forum.
