so is all debt backed by something?  Interesting but I don't understand how that could be possible with fractional reserve lending
@_date: 2019-03-11 00:14:52
just use a Portfolio app like Delta or Blockfolio? 
@_date: 2019-03-02 15:37:10
you will need to do KYC with your ID on coinbase, so being anonymous there is "very doubtful"
BTC Atm or Localbitcoins maybe?

I believe the correct term is "satoshical"  but I digress .  I have come peasant, what would you like to know?

I think he made another, better explained post... and turns out the poor guy is genuine and perhaps a bad luck Brian.  
@_date: 2019-03-17 17:54:24
have I just been woooooshed again, or is this a shitpost
@_date: 2019-03-13 23:23:35
alright my misunderstanding.  my thought was that the bill is an IOU from the bank/gov that would be traded for its backing asset (which it doesn't have) 
@_date: 2019-03-28 16:37:52
neat!

@_date: 2019-03-14 19:31:59
do you do any mining or operate a node?

oh hey wow, this version of your post looks much better �� love the title
@_date: 2019-03-11 00:03:14
You should do quarterly updates on how this works out for you.  That would be interesting 
@_date: 2019-03-15 19:29:08
where did this come from? 
@_date: 2019-03-04 20:58:54
last time I used bitcoin it took 6 hours roughly
edit: I was using an exchange and didn't have the option to adjust fees.

well this was a subpar satirical argument but I had fun trying.  
@_date: 2019-03-13 23:03:28
you can owe me monopoly money and that has no real backing?

lol you sir do you know what you're doing
@_date: 2019-03-13 22:46:21
this post is such a fail lol you sir have no idea what you're doing

coins are used as incentives for maintaining the network.  That way the people securing the network have a good reason to do so.
If the blockchain is private, the incentive for the company would be to not ruin their own network. 
@_date: 2019-03-10 23:39:58
this scares me, but you never know
@_date: 2019-03-13 23:11:59
this went from a shitpost to straight up woooosh art in minutes.  you've got skills 
@_date: 2019-03-15 13:22:44
they could but it would decrease the value of their fiat. Probably increasing their btc value but tanking their economy in the process
@_date: 2019-03-01 21:47:23
keep a backup copy of their keys for them?  not a perfect solution tho
@_date: 2019-03-11 00:05:20
I am rooting for you

these are all excellent answers, but if I was a noob... these answers would scare the crap out of me 
@_date: 2019-02-28 19:54:53
anybody will do anything if you can answer the question "what's in it for them"
@_date: 2019-02-28 19:59:38
side note:  you're a hero in this thread lmao  I would post that "careful he's a hero" spider man meme here but that's beyond my abilities 
@_date: 2019-02-12 21:53:26
The simplest way is probably coinbase but I found their fees have have increased like 10x since this time last year
@_date: 2019-02-28 17:30:16
I have faith in you amigo :)   if you need any resources to help the process don't hesitate to reach out.  I love helping my crypto fam &lt;3

@_date: 2019-02-28 17:19:25
if they got their crypto for free this won't be an issue
@_date: 2019-02-28 18:14:53
I like that idea!  keep a reserve copy of all their private keys for if/when they lose it hahaha
@_date: 2019-02-26 14:56:39

Gamify the experience for them
I'm blessed to say I've been able to introduce most of my friends/family to crypto with open arms.  the three critical components to this success is
- KISS (keep it simple stupid) 
- Games/Gamified experience to keep their engagement
- They need to think the learning that they're doing was  idea.  that's where the games come in.  they engage 'on their own' and therefore get the feeling of accomplishment that comes with learning, which encourages future learning
I'd be happy to share what I use, but i don't want to be a shill so DM me if you want them
@_date: 2019-02-28 19:43:14
edit: I'd also be really curious to see what 'reddit style communities' (not that it was possible) would have been saying about the internet before its rise
@_date: 2019-02-26 20:14:26
Apple would probably make a wallet with no private keys 
@_date: 2019-02-21 20:31:07
this sounds fantastically too good to be true
@_date: 2019-02-28 17:00:31
free is your friend right now
takes the pressure off.   you gotta fail forward.  but when money is on the line failure gets a little more scary
@_date: 2019-02-23 21:55:48
you're a legend bud,  well said
@_date: 2019-02-28 17:26:13
I agree with you!  the world needs to know about it.   But don't you think coming up with the idea to learn yourself is key? 
think of it as farming vs hunting.
water your seeds, plant ideas, support them
convincing is the equivalent of hunting, 
no one wants to be hunted
@_date: 2019-02-28 18:24:38
lol wut? 
@_date: 2019-02-28 20:02:10
everyone!  please don't downvote discussion you disagree with.  that conditions less interaction and limits this as a learning opportunity for YOU
@_date: 2019-02-28 19:57:25
lol this is exactly what happened to me!
like 10 years ago or something ridiculous one of my friends sat me down in his basement and played a YouTube video on fractional reserve lending.  I basically put on my tin hat and hid money in a shoebox my entire teenage and early adult years "looking' for a solution like Crypto.
I found crypto, crypto found me.  I'm not so sure anymore.  law of attraction is a crazy thing
@_date: 2019-02-12 21:50:27
that's a nice Loonie, 
and one day when they are removed from circulation due to inflation like the penny, we can actually do this ��
@_date: 2019-02-28 22:54:09
you sir, are a skilled evil genius.  well played
@_date: 2019-02-13 00:45:46
I don't understand it but I still think it's really cool
@_date: 2019-02-24 14:31:18
nah that's just Quadriga
@_date: 2019-02-13 01:29:22
it's true! but their closed-source software is sketchy.  When I asked the Devs about it they said it was "nacho business" and I've been left in the dark ever since. 
@_date: 2019-02-25 16:15:37
HA!  she sure missed out
@_date: 2019-02-28 17:20:04
a person convinced against their will is of the same opinion still
@_date: 2019-04-24 16:00:18
so if this bill doesn't pass you'd be paying both?
@_date: 2019-04-24 15:54:20
I agree with the tax declaration thing... but wouldn't merchants just add the tax on their end like they are supposed to anyways... and you pay it.  and they claim it.
I don't think I get to claim sales tax right now with fiat, so why would I have to with crypto.  it's the Merchants who are paying the tax (with customer funds technically).
it would be very crypto friendly of them (which would be nice), but given governments are basically just poorly run non-profit companies, this seems like it would only hurt them
@_date: 2019-04-16 13:52:11
any business is a non-profit if you're bad enough
@_date: 2019-04-24 16:07:52
well now I'm confused.  Because this makes sense.. but it's also so stupid my brain hurts. 
I guess they have no choice but to pass this bill.. no one in their right mind would pay a transaction fee, withdrawal fee, capital gains tax, and sales tax to be able to spend their money.
@_date: 2019-04-24 15:27:28
why would you ever save 17% on taxes?
@_date: 2019-04-24 15:22:51
"a transaction cost of $100 is a good deal then" 
I just died inside reading that..  Yea I'd totally love spending 16% on transaction fees.   Honestly guys... this makes no sense.
The government isn't going to lose out on Tax dollars because you chose an inefficient method of payment.  They need all the money they can get their hands on
@_date: 2019-04-24 15:41:08
so instead of selling for Fiat and paying Capital gains tax,  you would sell for goods and pay no tax (just the transaction fee).
ok, I see why someone would do that.  But now the bigger part of the question.   
Why would the government ever do that? it just doesn't seem to make any sense... 
they would be generating less revenue for themselves and devaluing their own currency.  They lose twice
