EOS was not tested within the case study by Howmuch and Coinanalysis. 
When a 3rd party study comes out (not completed by EOS themself), with EOS being tested in real world scenarios, and has been put through extensive testing like the ones mentioned in the article, then they can be added. 
They just launched their main net recently and had a ton of reported issues. We'll see how well they do once these kinks are ironed out. I'll be rooting for them. 
There is a BIG difference between what a coin claims and how speeds are derived when used by millions of users per day. With all that said, EOS may be added to the "Worth Mentioning" section, however everyone "claims" their favorite crypto is the fastest.

- No...there is no guarantee for anything, but the fact that the news is there and accumulating more ETFs, says something (especially BlackRock). That rebut can be played on anything. Too simple.
- Don't believe charting? I thought you were a logical guy. We can't be friends...lol.
- Yup....good news has come out and nothing happened.....well until now. During bull markets, news tends to matter more. Were not out of the woods yet, but there is a glimmer of hope and not because we recently rallied but due an anomaly on the charts (yes, this means something).
- 7 months is long for crypto, but not as long as other years like 2014.
Yes, momentum is there, however I like to take a stance on "something" according to history and current movements. Stating that we could see 50k, but we could also place 5k in the realm of possibilities is not really saying much. It's like the guy who says it could likely rain tomorrow, but the sky is telling me it'll be sunny. He's "kinda" right either way.

Once it finishes it's corrective ABC Elliot Wave. On the last leg now.

Yep...one difference this time is...
- start of q3 with 2 Major trillion dollar ETFs entering marketplace
- first closed break of descending channel on charts, which is what all the tech analysts have been looking for. 
- tons of bullish news (nothing new here)
- more and more "old money" entering the market every month.
- it's been 7 fuckin months....I think the bears are exhausted...lol.
