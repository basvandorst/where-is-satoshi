It means people have been discontinuing the use of their old mining technology. It will rise more, but soon mining difficulty will be governed more by Moore's Law and bitcoin price than anything else.
The mining industry just had to go through a few jumps in technology before they caught up with other industries. Now that there are no more major jumps in technology to be had (other than those jumps that are hoped for by all other industries) the mining difficulty increases will be more predictable.

I don't use Slack, but I'm signing up for it now to try for personal use. Unfortunately I'm from the government and any professional adoption of anything other than email is many years in the future.
I never saw the dollar sign in Gmail. I guess if I had a knack for seeing dollar signs I'd be working at a startup somewhere. ;)

Is there something about Cryptsy that makes them require stricter processes than Coinbase or Circle? If not, are Coinbase and Circle not doing enough to meet those regulations?
With those two services I'm essentially giving them access to a bank account. That sounds a bit frightening, but at least in those cases the potential for harm is limited to one account. The harm from compromised Cryptsy verification photos could go so much further.

What about email?
Have a changetip email that you can "cc" or "bcc" when replying to someone and including a tip in the email.
Considering how lengthy the text can be in emails it might require some slightly more specialized syntax.

Well now that this is official, I'd like to nominate myself to be an official ambassador of the internet. Specifically I would like to be the ambassador sent to Pizza Hut where I can eat my fill with no repercussions thanks to my diplomatic immunity.

Someone told me that bitcoin is considered property by the IRS, as opposed to any sort of financial instrument. Does anyone know about this? Property might not apply to this proposed rule.

I'm surprised there haven't been any attempts at doing this.  
You'd think there'd be thousands of alternate cryptocurrencies out there if that were the case.

The King was a great man, likely the best thing ever to happen to Thailand. Even Thaksin supporters will agree with that.  
You might want to be careful that you aren't doxxed because saying he has few morals while the country still mourns his death will likely get you a 1-way ticket back to Canada.

With the approval of the, now deceased, king. Corruption is widespread and that king was a great man. He could step in where the rest of government couldn't and get rid of people harming the country, like the ex-PM.
