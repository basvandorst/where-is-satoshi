The tech behind bitcoin (the Blockchain) is certainly valuable. However, as with any currency, the value of Bitcoin The Currency is in liquidity, the ability to exchange it for goods and services. That means Users, that means Community. If you think Doge is worthless to bitcoin and cryptos; consider the 25 000 or so new crypto users it has bought in. In 8 weeks. (assuming about half doge users are new, im far from certain about that)

I doubt it tbh. If Bitcoin becomes the currency of choice, it will be because its too hard to change, not because there is nothing better. We can already see the cracks showing. Its not definitively flawed or surpassed, but many of the alts are testing protocol tweaks that will eventually outdate Bitcoin.

Scarcity remains. We continue to make new toasters, that doesnt mean toasters are worthless. Inflation does not kill scarcity, and in careful moderation it encourages spending, which is required for a healthy economy. In a deflationary economy everyone is reluctant to spend, the economy stagnates, production and employment with it.
@_date: 2014-02-04 16:42:14
Well ok, as i said it was just a random thing i couldnt really verify. I guess i shouldnt have allowed myself to be sidetracked. Im not sure why you started talking about trade volume anyway; Something would have to be very wrong for bitcoin to be threatened in that way.
We were in fact talking about user adoption rates. You were saying you dont believe doge is bringing new users faster than bitcoin (and litecoin combined), because you've seen no irrefutable figures. I was saying that although i cant be bothered finding total proof which would require some extensive market research, the 50000 users in r/dogecoin in under 8 weeks seems fairly indicative of its growth rate. Its true that crypto users are not confined to reddit, but i dont think its unreasonable to say its a hub. Besides, just as bitcoin extends beyond reddit, so does doge.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:02:29
I dont think Doge is 'taking' new users from btc. Its introducing an entirely new demographic. Which is great! In the end, we want more people using cryptos, it doesnt matter which.
And lets be honest, btc is the standard. Its what the others measure against. Its what everyone trades back into to spend. People are getting worked up that doge has reliable $ -&gt; D, but what really matters is vendors accepting cryptos directly. Thats the holy grail. Thats where bitcoin reigns. You think Gold gives a shit which currency is strongest? fuck that, its gold.
@_date: 2014-02-04 14:36:15
I know, but thats not really relevant unless doge is viewed simply as an investment stock. We want cryptos to be a/the day to day currency. That means vendors accepting.
@_date: 2014-09-04 00:16:12
At [41mins]( he gives one of the better breakdowns of the mining process that i've seen, and mentions that once 'enough' transactions have been authenticated and sealed into the block, the block is passed to the network for peer review. 
This much i've always understood, however, how many is 'enough'? a % of the transactions since the last block? everything within a time frame? a % of a time frame?  
the block is supposed to be completed roughly every ten minutes, so there must be a mechanism to prevent a backlog, could anyone explain how many transactions is enough to create a block?
@_date: 2014-01-25 10:15:59
Cryptos are intimidating and difficult to understand. Doge completely avoids the issue through humour. No one is saying Doge is fundamentally better than bitcoin, but nor is it fundamentally worse (actually it probably is, because of the confirmation time, but thats subjective).
@_date: 2014-07-25 10:19:51
Ah ok, that sounds more reasonable!
@_date: 2014-02-04 02:29:50
Is that bad? We always knew bitcoin was the pioneer, not the end product. Bitcoin is the future of currency, but not *The future currency*.
Nor is Doge, obviously; if doge were to overtake bitcoin, it would be because of a broader appeal and adoption, not some inherent advantage. 
But to be against a new currency because its not bitcoin is completely against [what i consider] the fundamental ideology behind the crypto movement. It seems insane to me to say 'hey, we have this amazing new advancement that makes currency work better in almost every way. By the way, no further advancement is possible.'
@_date: 2014-02-04 02:48:25
I wouldnt say doge is innovating. Its catching up, certainly, and its drawing in users outside bitcoins usual spheres, but there is nothing in its protocol or infrastructure that can be considered innovative. It is scrypt, but thats not a doge innovation; its got faster blocks, but that doesnt really mean anything except a bloated chain; its high coin cap, but again that is just a psychological thing, and if it should be considered an innovation, the honor goes to Litecoin again.
Better i think to say that Doge has greater potential for innovation. And this is due more to its low value than anything else. Changing bitcoin protocol is a huge deal, because of the investment involved. Just like a smaller startup can be more agile than a large company tied down in red tape, Doge is flexible enough to react to new developments. For now.
I think thats why i see potential growth in Doge, because its like a young startup with a lot of users. Its young enough to react and to take advantage of innovation, but has enough users to matter.
@_date: 2014-02-04 05:19:01

On the other hand, Doge has a demonstrably broader appeal. Adoption rate, and *where* those adopters are coming from shows pretty clearly that people are less intimidated by doge. Doge is bringing in new users from outside the traditional 'tech and libertarian' circles as bitcoin.
There are a number of reasons for that, probably chief among them are the low value and the fact that bitcoin paved the way, however the fact remains that more new crypto users are going for doge than for bitcoin and litecoin combined. 
This isnt a bad thing. It doesnt take long for people to figure out that in order to use their crypto, doge users probably have to convert it into btc, and hey presto, we have a new bitcoin enthusiast. We shouldnt be fighting a civil war amongst cryptos, its all about crypto vs fiat.
@_date: 2014-01-16 09:53:04
Thats not an answer, thats not even an evasion, its a flat refusal to acknowledge. Presumably because you cant answer in any way that supports your argument.
Its true that you very likely use government services every day. Are you not willing to pay for them? do you not agree that everything a person uses should be paid for?
As for monopolists, high horses, and pointing guns at people, im not sure what you're talking about, but im pretty sure you arnt either.
@_date: 2014-04-27 13:02:15
So support smaller merchants who are a part of the community.
Besides, it goes both ways. If you were paid in bitcoin, would you not sell some of it back for cash? maybe even most of it? Most people cant pay rent, loan payments, or even groceries in btc. Thats not going to change until the local government either embraces btc, or collapses.
I get what OP is trying to say, we need ways to earn small amounts of btc, the kind of amounts we are actually spending. But thats a much larger question than it seems. How many ways do we earn fiat? I have a job, and I occasionally sell things second hand; Not many people truly want their entire salary in btc, and market places for second hand goods exist, as do marketplaces for freelance work. What else do you want? What else is there? It comes back to my original point, the best way to get bitcoin it to exchange goods or services for it -&gt; "when you spend bitcoin, someone is earning it"

Did you delete your previous comment? I think i misinterpreted it before, thinking you were talking about the recent decision to include inflation in the protocol.
But you're saying that alts are diluting the scarcity of bitcoin. Perhaps, in the sense that if you were to take the market cap of all the alts and add it to bitcoin, btc would be higher. But thats not a sure thing, nor is it really how the market works. The existence of silver doesnt reduce the value of gold. If i trade btc for nmc, the btc doesnt disappear, the value doesnt decrease, it just transfers to a new owner. because btc is still largely the gateway for fiat -&gt; crypto, demand for alts demand for btc. This is basic stuff, an obvious analogy is the way USD is used for oil purchases, and why wars are waged to keep it that way.
Anyway thats a massive side track. Scarcity in the information age. Yes, we can keep creating things, no this doesnt mean things are worthless. The value is in its liquidity, scarcity is just how we divide it.
tl,dr; you're kind of rude and didnt really offer anything relevant to the conversation.

Do you drive on roads? do you get water from a tap? do you get electricity from the grid? do you use any of the countless other services provided by the state in exchange for taxes? Shit, even your ownership of property is a right granted to you and defended for you by the state, under the states laws. Most people take advantage of the states laws in a thousand ways they dont even consider, every day. You think this just runs itself? You think you'd be better off without it? Maybe you would, i dont know you, but society would not. 99% of people would be significantly worse off.
Controlled substances i will grant is less cut and dry. However, there is no denying that the harder drugs, specifically meth and heroine, have a negative impact not just on the users, but to people around them, often helpless people (kids). People will always say 'yeah well im a responsible user', but in the end very few are. Again, i dont know you, so i have to keep it general, but enough people end up damaging the lives of those around them to make it pretty clearly bad for the community in general.

I don't know you, but I would bet money that you, like most people, would complain about unpaid overtime, being forced (not asked) to exercise your expertise to unpaying clients not of your choosing, stolen intellectual property, whichever parallel might apply to your line of work. If you don't agree with the ethical argument, surely you will acknowledge the more pragmatic element; that she makes her money from her image, and her image has been stolen, distributed and irreparably damaged by this leak, costing her at least some part of her livelihood.

I didnt say you cant buy things with it, I said at the moment it is more of a stock. Bitcoin is behaving, and being treated by most, as a commodity, not a currency. As such, it is traded with other alts on exchanges, like stocks.
In that context, dogecoin is just another stock, an even more speculative one which people invest in in the hopes that it will gain to btc.
If you really insist on the whole 'but i can buy things with it!' thing, then ill point out that you can buy things with doge too. If you intend to say doge is worthless because it is accepted by less vendors than btc (which seems to be what you're implying), i must suggest you look into USD, it can be spent at any store in the US, and even some countries outside the us.
@_date: 2014-02-04 02:36:30
There are advantages to the inflation. 5% per year isnt so bad, and it encourages use as a currency, not just as an investment. 
The only problem i have with the inflation in doge is that it was accidental, rather than by design. Thats just an instinctual thing, im uncomfortable with anything not done on purpose. In fact, fortunate mistakes are quite common when you look back on scientific history.
@_date: 2014-02-04 20:32:18

Ahh, ok. That is a good point, however i think bitcoin is becoming (or is already) too bureaucratic to go changing the protocol, nor would the community tolerate other protocols using the same blockchain. There is simply too much invested in it as is.
I view doge as a young startup with a good (great) user base. Its flexible and has the potential to out maneuver and out innovate its larger competitors. The analogy breaks down at the 'competitors' part, because i dont view cryptos as in competition at all.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:50:35
Psychological factors. The welcoming community that so many bitcoiners sneer at (such a succinct example), the large number of coins rather than fractions, the quick block times which make people think its faster, the wealth distribution (im not sure if that actually worked out, but its well known that bitcoin is poorly distributed), its publicity drives, its focus on being the social currency, etc.

Fair enough, where should I get the stats from? As you say, Electricity is very difficult to estimate, as we dont know where all the mining is happening, nor how much they are paying. However even taking the (extremely) conservative estimate of $0.10/kwh, we're getting dangerously low operating margins.

Im not saying these things are important or even real. It doesnt really matter what the reality is in this context, just the impression to new users. Im only suggesting these factors as possible drivers behind the speedy adoption of Doge, to which you expressed bemusement.
I get what you mean about r/bitcoin on an individual level, but the overall attitude toward, say, dogecoin is pretty negative. That may not reflect most users opinion (although it might), but the anti-alt faction seems more vocal. One simply has to look to the OP we are replying to to see another description of this well noted phenomenon.
Anyway, as i said, doge is not inherently better, but its undeniably bringing in new users at a faster rate than bitcoin itself. I posit that this could be in part due to its approachability vs Bitcoin.

I'm not so sure about this. It seems like saying if you possess encypted information, you are not responsible for what it is when decypted, because that would take spcific tools.
Fact remains that blockchain could and probably is used to share child porn. So is the internet, but here the information is actually stored locally (possession) and actively spread by node operators. 
It would be a ridiculous charge, but if a gov really wanted an excuse to ban cryptos or go after an individual, this might give them a premise.

the core of it seems to be here:


Im not up to speed with SegWit / block size etc argument, but it sounds like they're in favor of a higher block size limit, which apparently is at odds with SegWit /BIP148. As I said I've been out of the loop a couple years now and am trying to catch up
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:23:03
I imagine those kind of questions have been asked and answered, the argument yet rages...
I think its basically because (and I may be wrong, anyone reading this please dont yell at me) in order for SegWit to work, it needs to use side chains. Side chains are processed by a third party, which is  in ideological opposition to a trustless network.
I've also heard that it will expand the block capacity 4x and *only* 4x, meaning that a whole new solution may be necessary a couple years down the road

I think hes saying that other than current popularity, there is nothing setting btc apart. Even the infrastructure being built around bitcoin doesnt protect it, its very very easy to port to, say, litecoin.

It is relative, but not relative to how well off you were before, but to how well off everyone else is. Welcome to market forces.


If something has a direct benefit to an individual or a class of people, and a theoretical, abstract, or amorphous benefit to everybody else,  the proponent’s intentions are to benefit the former, not the latter. If you have a silver lining, its because you're getting fucked.

One of the problems with distribution is that there is no one really pushing it. If someone was willing to shell out a couple mil to push to manufacturers and suppliers at something like the Canton Fair... to be honest i think china is where its going to take off. The government seems to be actively exploring it, with the new exchange and baidu.

far more centralized though, rich getting significantly richer. Its important to remember to consider the global view. There are countries here it is almost impossible to get btc even if you have the money and knowledge to do so. eg, im currently visiting bangladesh, a country of over 150 million, famous as an IT outsourcing destination, but not a single listing on localbitcoin, no way to make internet transfers, less than 10% of people have a bank account, let alone credit cards. If bitcoin takes off, these people get left behind in a big way

I think its not so much that they are carbon copies, as that most meaningful advances can be incorporated into btc without the need to change currency. But there definitely are advantages to some other coins. I have a reasonable bet on Namecoin, because its focusing on utility over value store/currency.

People dont understand money either, they just think they do. Once people start seeing 'Bitcoin Accepted Here' places they visit, they will start to feel familiar with it, like they understand it. People dont understand email, or even the internet. But they use it every day. It took decades to reach that point, but it happened. Bitcoin is the long game, we still have a long way to go.

Im not too sure. Most governments seem to be happy enough taxing it as capital gains for now. Germany has somewhat embraced it, and an american judge ruled it to be currency. I think Thailand has outlawed it. Canada has experimented with its own crypto-currency, Mintchip.
I guess the banks are not too pleased, but it really just comes down to moving with the times and tech. Other industries have experienced their own instances of 'software eating the world', some were able to roll with it and flourish, others floundered. In truth, banks are in some of the best positions to take advantage of btc, and i'd bet many are developing plans, but for now its too risky to move openly.
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:27:52
This kind of worries me from a 'rich get richer' standpoint, particularly at a global level. I've heard a lot of people call bitcoin an equalizing force; Its not, it will leave the developing world behind. Some, like Kenya, would benefit, most others would get even more screwed than they already are.
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:12:55
No one is arguing the ideal, im talking reality. In a situation where i can pay my rickshaw in btc, it has become so valuable that the early adopters are silly rich, controlling the money supply. Where are those early adopters? By and large, they're where the money already is. But now they have even more of the money supply, the *global* money supply, so where before local economies were somewhat insulated from outside interference, because theirs was a separate supply, now they are subject to a hugely topheavy global money supply. Cue inescapable inequality.
An estimate in a recent thread was that in the case of mass adoption, about 8 million btc would be available to the general public (non-early adopters). A rough picture can be seen if we distribute that as wealth is now. They're left with a third of the money supply they had before.
The rich get richer.
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:34:43

I take it you mean they know about it but dont want to invest. Thats fair enough, if thats the case they can hardly complain later. But did you invest in FB? Microsoft? Apple? Google? AirBnB? Uber? Dropbox? No? 
Assuming by 'everyone i look at' you mean people you know, and speak to, otherwise you have no way of knowing their circumstances. So these people you know, they probably share something with you, thats why you know them. Social Circles. Im guessing you are educated, perhaps a professional, or a lifestlyer. You probably have an interest in Tech or Finance as mentioned above, possibly a degree. You're almost certainly western, from America or UK, maybe europe. You're interested in world issues, stay abreast of news. You might even read Hacker News.
If even a bit of that bullshit crystalball gazing is accurate, you're likely rich. You're in a prime position to have heard about bitcoin early, and because you're surrounded in like people, rich people. You probably dont realize that most other people are in a *far less* prime position. So yes, those around you have probably heard about it and chosen not to jump in. More fool them. But they are a minority, a larger group than adopters to be sure, but a vast minority even so. 
Im sorry this is a pretty blunt and rude comment, but its kind of insulting to hear someone say that billions of people around the world with no means of knowing anything about bitcoin, much less understanding it, much less acquiring some, deserve to get fucked and have no one to blame but themselves. These people make up the majority, but orders of magnitude.
edit: i just reread, im sorry that did get pretty heated. I wont alter it, but will say that i didnt intend to be so personal, i meant to illustrate the typical btc early adopter

its protected from inflation because there is no way to 'print money'. New bitcoins are created at a predictable, and transparent rate, with a finite cap (21mil).
System is open source, viewable by anyone, and has been extensively analyzed both by security experts and people actually wanting to break it. The potential gain from exploiting some loophole is huge, so many many people are trying, as we speak. That they have not succeeded is not a guarantee that they never will, but it does lend a sense of reliability.
The weakness at the moment seems to be where btc meets other currencies, the exchanges. That weakness is not inherent in btc any more than it is in established currencies, but in human error (and malice). Recent examples of both could be the 18yo in aus who just fucked up his site security, and the guys claiming to be in Hong Kong who did a runner.
edit: i only have a loose understanding of all this myself, if anyone wants to correct me, please do

Re: Internet access, you may be surprised. Although usage is low in many developing countries, coverage is often surprisingly good. I get faster internet in rural Cambodia than i did at home in Auckland, NZ. If btc ever became that prevalent, there would be ways to access it, even if its just by integrating with existing infrastructure eg. M-PESA Mobile Money in Kenya (and many other countries) has been integrated with btc via the Kipochi app. Its a messy solution, but it works.

Global market / global currency. If a coke is .0000001 in america, it wont be much less in myanmar. Except the money supply in myanmar is a fraction that in US, so that .0000001 is a months wage. Local markets for local products would stay affordable, anything imported or exportable would be priced same as whatever the richest countries are willing to pay, putting them far out of reach of others.

Try to get it in writing. I assume because of the $20k they're holding that you will have further dealings with that same analyst, try to either get it in writing, OR on a recorded phone call. Many states have a law where only one party needs to agree to record a conversation, so you can record phones without telling them.
Basically, get an official statement saying "Chase no like btc"
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:14:05
To get in on bitcoin, even at this stage, you need:
-Access to a Computer
-An internet connection
-Knowledge of bitcoins existence (at this stage that means and interest in tech or finance, or people in your social circle to introduce you. That probably indicates a high level of education.)
-Capital to invest (this could be seen as a kind of polar to knowledge. The earlier you hear about it, the less capital you need)
-A vague understanding and trust of technology
-Identification, Bank accounts, Proof of Address, Credit Cards, various other documents OR Availability to buy for cash locally (very difficult outside of rich areas)
Thats hardly exhaustive, but knowledge of bitcoin alone probably rules out 99% of the 'general population'. And all of them indicate pre-existing wealth.

Its still way easier to get in US than almost anywhere else. At least those exchanges, coinbase, and local sellers are available to you.
I know we're talking in the context of the hearing and making sure it stays easy for US, but dont lose sight of the fact that it is really really easy. As an example, im currently in a city of 7million, with the closest sellers on localbitcoin 300km away (in another country) and s/he has a limit of $135. The next closest is in yet another country, 700km away, and overcharging by 40%. And of course there is no online option. So yeah, anyway, dont forget its incredibly easy in US still.

Depending on your point of view, its either because the earlier you invest, the greater the risk, so greater the returns. Thats standard for new tech. 'Pump n Dump' implies inflated, unsupported value. That could be said of btc right now, but over the long run it has real value, and eventually we will settle on a general agreement as to that value.
Otherwise; because you dont actually intend to 'sell' it, but to spend it, (which is basically the same thing i guess, but it feels different). so yeah you got in early, but you're not evangelizing to increase the value, but because its simply better. You happened to get in early, but thats because you recognized its value not because you calculated the potential returns (granted its difficult *not* to speculate). 
@_date: 2013-11-04 06:11:42
