economies are failing as we speak and citizens are seeking refuge in btc because it’s the best option to maintain/export their remaining currency out of the broken system.. record investing all over... going to have to say dank reddit memes have nothing to do with it..

No dip at 12500 or 13000 kind of surprised me.. what makes you sure about the 15k dip?

Is more of a buy-the-dip scheme ya feel me?

Powerful stuff, glad you shared this

The logic is bitcoin can’t really work as a currency until at least 100k a coin

Ohh I’m planning on hodling but I can’t help but wonder why I have not seen this type of movement yet

Don’t forget the way coinbase is basically hedging bitcoin from failing.. I joined last week when coinbase gained more users in one day than ever before and it restricted our spending until the first transactions are complete.. in other words a massive amount of ppl will be allowed to dump more in over the next few days

No kidding wth is happening

I agree about the futures.. a way for people to try and make money without actually investing in the coin :/    This game ain’t for shaky hands lol.    But what you said about people buying assets.. I disagree based off of what gold did over the last few years.  To me the words “asset”, “commodity”, “currency”, all mean the same thing. tradable value and a perceived trust in that value.

I've been hearing this question for months.. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:14:44
you have to assume the trade sites are now worth millions of dollars themselves.. if they dump a majority of what they are profiting from the transaction fees back into bitcoin when it dips not only will they perpetuate their own business and they will get more for the bitcoin they are sitting on.. There is no doubt greed is causing a lot of this, but the result will be the success of bitcoin being widely used.
