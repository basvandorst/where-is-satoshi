Notice a pattern in all the transactions.
In each hack TX an amount is being sent back to a multi-sig address (presumably bitfinex address) and a large amount to a P2PKH address (hacker's address).
I am guessing that the vulnerability involved creating an output back to bitfinex to 'trick' some of their code into signing the transaction.

Coins.ph is good

In my experience the easiest to setup for someone is Xapo.com, but they have to mail a check to buy bitcoin.
 is easy too, if you're using airbitz or copay, but low buy/sell limits.
Circle.com is also quick and easy most of the time. Also has low buy/sell limits.
Coinbase has always been the most difficult.

Its only unrefusable if you denominate your services in dollars.
The "legal tender" just means that the dollar BILL must be accepted in payment for dollars.
If I want to sell my services for .2 BTC/hour its legal and I can refuse dollars.

Try this: 
As an added bonus, it can generate the Electrum Seed AND split it into multiple shares.

* Bitcoin is electronic cash that is cannot be controlled by any government or corporation.
* Bitcoin transactions are like cash and are 100% irreversible.
* Bitcoin is the newest and possibly the best form of money invented.
* Bitcoins, like gold, are scarce and limited in their total supply. No more than 21 million bitcoins can ever be created.

I have no affiliation with Coinbase, in fact **I don't even keep more than $10 in coinbase at any time, and I prefer circle for buying bitcoin because its instant.**
I just think its pathetic when a bitcoin company offers no reward to white-hat hackers who help them prevent black-hat attacks that can cost millions.
I discovered and reported a serious bug, and as a pen-tester I expected a bug bounty, when I found out there was no such bounty I was surprised and irritated.
So yes, my post did come across as a little bit of a smear, but just because I was so irritated. I'm still recommending Bitpay to merchants who want an easy POS solution for accepting bitcoin.
You can check my post history to see that I discovered this exploit within hours of the CoPay 0.9.0 release, if you don't believe me.

"You can no longer uninvent that like you cannot uninvent electricity or thermodynamics. When you have fragmentation and isolation in the natural world, it causes evolution to accelerate. If you take a country like Russia and they decide to ban Bitcoin, you will see the evolution of highly stealthy and uniquely Russian coins that are uniquely suited to bribery and corruption of the Russian system, diverting the Russian legal system, and subverting the authoritarian rule. Those versions of cryptocurrency will be much better suited for the Russian environment, and will evolve to be much more dynamic for that niche, rights, powers, freedom, and wealth. The more authoritarian the government is, the more radical the coins. In terms of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is a cuddly little Panda bear." - Andreas Antonopoulos

Darkcoin is better for anonymity.

Upvoted. Thanks for responding. I still think Bitpay ought to have a bug bounty program. BitPay has $32.7 million in angel and venture capital funding, and a lot of people have come to trust CoPay, even though its still in Beta. Bitpay should implement a bug reward program immediately to maintain this trust, and to show that security comes as first priority.
I do think that a company's willingness to pay bounties for bugs is a good measure of how much they care about security, and when we're dealing with bitcoin security is everyone's  priority. Failure to value security high enough can lose even the best reputation in one very serious mistake (think blockchain.info.)
All in all, I think bitpay is a great company, and I appreciate your contribution to open source. Thats more than most bitcoin companies do, and it means a lot to the whole community. Thank you for what you do.
I look forward to using CoPay to secure my own funds when I feel like it is mature enough.

Yes, should be optional to include them in the balance or not.
For now, you can just use another app (maybe mycelium) to track watch only addresses.

Bitcoin paper cash idea:
* Private key split between two sides of paper bill
* Bill must be scanned to read both sides and re-construct private key
* Bill contains embedded 'change address' which allows merchant to return change to a new addres
* The bills are marked sequentially, and the 'change address' is the next bill in the sequence.
So if you are carrying 5 bills on you, you're able to transact 5 times. Each time you use a paper bill with a merchant the change is sent to the next bill and the bill you used is discarded or kept as the receipt.

I just discovered a bug, a rather serious one.
**Login accepts any password I enter.**
I created a local profile (on device, not on server), and I skipped setting a pin. Now I am able to login to the profile with any password I enter. Each time I login it prompts me to enter a pin again, but I skip this step and it takes me right into the profile.
This is very concerning to me. Obviously the profile isn't encrypted, otherwise this would be impossible.

Why not let the free market decide how much more bitcoins are worth than fiat currency? Currently, its worth about 33% more in my experience.

Use an open source Google authenticator client. There are several. One I've used is a chrome extension and the source code is on GitHub. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 07:45:11
Agreed. They should at least allow the derivation path to be customized.
What made it seem suspicious to me is that (1) this is a new issue, coinbin verify tab used to return the same results for both, and (2) the arrows returning a different result than just copying/pasting into the verify tab.
However, we've now confirmed that the keys do match, so it seems more like a severe bug. Looking at their github repo it seems like they have no code test coverage.... a bit scary.
@_date: 2016-12-17 12:48:38

ok. Yes, this tool does return the same list of addresses from the xpub/priv keypair generated on coinbin when using the bip32 tab with "m/" as the path.
So maybe this is is a non-malicious bug on the coinbin verify page.
@_date: 2016-12-28 08:43:27
Thank you. Looking forward to finding out what the issue is.
And sorry for jumping to the conclusion that it was malicious...  it seems like the keys do match, and its more likely an issue with the verify tab. Not sure. 
By the way, I've really appreciated your tool. So thanks for building it :)

Thanks. I linked to that above. Wasn't able to get it to work. Let me try it again and see if I can make it work.
Edit: just re-tested this script by running the ElectrumTest.php file; ran into a parse error without even making a change to the code.
Also, the example MPK is using the old Electrum format, not the new xpub format used by Electrum 2.0.
Their MPK format is 819519e966729f31e1855eb75133d9e7f0c31abaadd8f184870d62771c62c2e759406ace1dee933095d15e4c719617e252f32dc0465393055f867aee9357cd52
The format Electrum gives now is

Having issues, because of this line of code:
    $num = gmp_strval(gmp_init($hex, 16), 58);
Our shared server (site5) won't let us upgrade GMP 4.1 to GMP 4.2 and base58 [requires gmp 4.2](
So I would have to patch the base58 encode function from another library I guess.
This xpub function has turned into quite the project for me :) Currently trying to get the python code sample posted above to work.

Yes. You can buy &amp; sell to make a profit. Buying and holding might be a better strategy though.

This looks awesome! I've paid over $1000 in oDesk fees. Kudos!!!
Will you be adding escrow functionality? Multi-Sig?

Does it have to be a mobile app (iOS/Android/etc)? Or does a web-app also qualify?
@_date: 2015-04-03 21:49:06
Try [Wallet32]( - it uses scrypt
@_date: 2015-04-04 23:22:09
No; because you always spend change back to yourself. So even if the change goes to new address, it is not anonymous.
Is it better than using one address? Yes, much better.
@_date: 2015-04-03 02:39:37
post the transaction ID or the address

This is for privacy reasons. The bitcoin rich list is full of addresses with known pubkeys (spend transactions) and tens of millions of dollars sitting in them.
My point was simply that **by requiring unspent outputs to the address you effectively prevent (disincentivise) a single key from being publicly leaked** like so many software licence keys.... the moment it leaks, someone would spend the outputs.
@_date: 2015-11-27 02:42:39
Try airbitz or try Xapo.com if you're willing to put a check in the mail or do a wire transfer. 
@_date: 2015-11-17 04:10:41


Requiring a minimum balance of 0.5 btc should be enough to prevent sharing of the private key.
But this doesn't prevent User B from relaying the nonce to User A who can then sign the challenge message and send it back to user B.

I mean sending the private key, or a 'redeem link' over sms/email.
A few wallets already support this. Kudos to them. Its a big step forward in usability for the 'average user.'
@_date: 2015-03-24 21:34:39


Such a stupid comparison. There will never be 58 million bitcoins.  If big numbers give you warm fuzzies then you might as well say it this way:

If you have a smartphone, it might be your safest / easiest option.
You could create a copay.io wallet with your computer and your phone as signers.

Do I have to get invited to join their Slack team?
@_date: 2015-03-08 05:32:28
Yes, it really should be built into wallet apps too. Its so easy to implement with a wallet. Just different addresses/private keys.
@_date: 2015-03-22 04:09:39
Worked for me. I was able to upload a file and create a listing.
@_date: 2015-03-17 21:53:13

The Derivation Path is different. Different bips.
Bip 44 uses m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index
Bip 32 uses m/iH/0/k
You can try different dirivation paths here 
Basically with wallet32 it uses bip44 which lets you have multiple logical accounts.

I'm interested in buying a binary covered call option for 6 months or 12 months. Interested in strike prices from $280-$500.
Let me know if you are willing to write such an option for 100+btc.

Very true :)

Exactly! I've never saved 1/10th as much before I discovered bitcoin. Now I look at a cheeseburger and think 'The future value of that $1.50 is about $1500, do I really need it?"

Confirmed. THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!
@_date: 2015-10-30 23:01:10
I think it's called a "fill or kill by date" transaction. 
Blockstream is working on this for the liquid sidechain I think. 
Its called nKillTime or nExpiryTime... see discussion here

'Trial do-over', lol :)

This should be upvoted for scam awareness. I know at least 10 people locally who joined this scam. Complete ponzi scheme. Closed source. They claim its backed by gold. Just a total scam.

You can send from unconfirmed inputs with copay.io

We need hidden volumes/plausible deniability encryption on phones to protect from duress. This should be built into every bitcoin wallet too.

Subscriptions for a PUSH payment system! This is so much better than 50 companies PULLing money from my account where I have to call them up and wait 20 minutes on hold to cancel a subscription. I want ALL my subscriptions managed by a dashboard like this. 100% control over all my subscriptions, and one place to manage them all :)
@_date: 2015-03-03 09:29:49
True. So I could lock $20 to Coke for 1 year, and for the next year that $20 would be spendable at any coke machine without an internet connection. I guess a double-spend would still be possible by visiting multiple coke machines before transactions were 'gathered and broadcast.'

Who the hell wants to use a currency that has no limits on how much can be printed, and has lost 98.6% of its value since 1913?
I'd rather use a currency that has guaranteed supply limits and has gained 400,000% in value in the last 5 years without any proof-of-violence to enforce its value.

This is the answer

If the server is compromised by bad actors the code could be changed to send the keys to the server. The next time the user used the service it would upload his keys.

First link is still up. 48 downloads and counting. Glad Google drive worked for you.
If they get pulled down I can share a torrent.

Multi sig uses p2sh, and the fee is slightly higher than for normal transactions
@_date: 2015-03-10 04:20:23
[Wallet32]( supports BIP 44 (multiple logical accounts inside an hd wallet) and you can generate multiple addresses within the app.
@_date: 2015-02-20 12:08:38
@_date: 2015-03-07 08:09:51
Yes, I think it will. Might take 8-12 years though. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 05:54:41
Are you using a multi-sig address?
@_date: 2015-03-25 00:39:29


The best defense against rogue nodes would probably be to mix each input multiple times. Because there is no counterparty risk and only transaction fees it shouldn't be any problem to mix wallet inputs several times.
This mixing feature could be built into privacy-friendly wallet software and it could all happen in the background without much user interaction.
@_date: 2015-02-12 23:07:28
This is too funny! I've thought a few times that 'After Decentralization' could be the new A.D.  :)
