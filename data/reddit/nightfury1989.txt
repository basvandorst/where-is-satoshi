Coinbase charges no fee to withdraw bitcoins 
But when I transfer bitcoins from ledger nano S to coinbase again there is a transaction fee
So I wanted to avoid that
@_date: 2019-11-08 19:26:17
Is your code = 24 words seed

@_date: 2019-11-08 19:18:51
If I understand it correctly , you want to convert your bitcoin to fiat using coinbase 
You can send your bitcoins from your device to the coinbase bitcoin address 
You can find that address by following -&gt; bitcoin -&gt; receive bitcoin , that’s your bitcoin address 
And then attach your bank account and withdraw

If you don’t know anything about crypto then how are you so sure that it will be the future ?
@_date: 2019-11-07 20:54:30
It’s a great idea , if you could somehow gain more by getting more followers than you lose giving away bitcoin 
You need an initial investment to attract more followers 
That’s a great concept

I imagine , after using investing all those resources and time 
You find a seed with only 0.00000001btc ��

I see ppl who invested/mined bitcoin way back in 2011-2012 does not even recover their bitcoins 
Ppl who stores on exchanges lost few 
So my question is what were the ways ppl could buy bitcoin and not lose it 
This is the question to the people who bought very early
@_date: 2019-11-03 00:01:03
So it works the following way.
Say Alice wants to buy bitcoin, Bob(robinhood ) purchases the bitcoin on your behalf. Alice pays bob the money(9K)
Bob holds the private keys to the bitcoin. So Alice wont be able to trade that bitcoin. The only operation here Alice can do is ask Bob to sell that bitcoin and give Alice back the money.
This is one disadvantage
Second disadvantage , in case of a hard fork you Alice cant claim the hard forked coin. Like bitcoin cash had a hard fork
But Bob can claim that coin since he had private key( Pros on reddit , correct me if i am wrong on this)
On wallet , you hold the private key.
@_date: 2019-11-19 18:54:57
Good job
@_date: 2019-11-01 13:11:15
Yeah you can buy 1kg bitcoin at local grocery store and keep it in your refrigerator
No one will know if you use cash
@_date: 2019-11-27 01:53:15
If your coins was on pro coinbase and you have address whitelist on 
You could have saved some hassle
Besides that , when your phone was stole 
You have changed your coinbase password
@_date: 2019-11-14 03:53:33

And end up buying high
@_date: 2019-10-21 05:29:56
Haha thank you
@_date: 2019-10-22 22:26:36
Does anyone remember , in the recent time 
Coinbase server went down and also Robinhood was down 
You could only sell crypto when the price reached 13,700$ or so 
Did the same thing happened the last time on 17th dec 2018 ?
@_date: 2019-10-22 23:06:00
Ok cool thanks
@_date: 2019-10-22 23:05:27
So you send your bitcoins from A to websiteB mix them up and send it to your destination C ?
@_date: 2019-10-31 01:34:28
I do the same , I know your salary now lol ����
@_date: 2019-10-31 18:09:47
I wish I had a job when in 2013 like when you guys joined 
I started supported bitcoin now from April
@_date: 2019-10-30 16:50:50
I am new user of ledger live And I have my coins on Coinbase 
Correct me if I am wrong 
This isssue can’t be reproduced even by newbee now since Coinbase pro ask you to add new address to your Coinbase pro address book first ( 24 hours before ) before you send any crypto to that address. 
So in any way if you try to send coins to address from your previous transaction 
You have to consciously add that address to your know address and after 24 hours you can send coins
@_date: 2019-10-22 22:59:17
Why do you want to hide transactions ? 
Just curious 
And thanks for replying

@_date: 2019-10-30 22:07:50
Why would some one add a wrong address and wait for 48 hours to get approved/cool down? 
Instead of using the already added address ?
