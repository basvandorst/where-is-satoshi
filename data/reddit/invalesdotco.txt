It is a very good cheat.

Everything that is in the BTC wiki that is true of Bitcoin is also true of Bcash, with the exception of the block size and segregated witness data. Bcash's genesis block was 478559 of the original blockchain. Bcash has the original bitcoin distribution, and builds upon the original blockchain. We now have 2 separate currencies with the same but diverging history. One of bitcoin's greatest strengths is its original distribution and it's history. Both chains now have that same history, and both chains will have 21 million tokens. Both chains claim that they are the "original" bitcoin, and they both have valid claims as such. I think that Bcash is an ALT, but it has gotten SO MUCH value from being a fork of the original blockchain versus any other ALT!
I know I'm repeating myself, and I'm not really asking you a question. This is me trying to have a discussion about Bitcoin with others who might understand where I am coming from.

This is what I was looking for. I think I am being impatient, we just need to wait for the dust to settle. Thank you.

And yet, if you look at the "other" sub you will see multiple threads claiming just that

I agree, and thanks for your reply.
My confusion is coming from a place where LTC had its own genesis block, as well as all other alts having their own genesis blocks. They all had their own unique original distributions. 
On the other hand, Bcash's genesis block was 478559 of the original blockchain. Bcash uses the original bitcoin distribution, and builds upon the original blockchain. Bcash and BTC are veeeery similar, the only difference being how they treat the block size / segregated witness data. 
Is it an ALT? Yes. But it's a different kind of ALT. It's difficult to explain this to someone who hasn't been paying attention this whole time.

Split or duplicated, I don't think it matters in the long run which word you choose to use. As you say, we now have 2 separate currencies with the same but diverging history. One of bitcoin's greatest strengths is its original distribution and it's history. Both chains now have that history, and both chains will have 21 million tokens. Both chains believe that they are the "original" bitcoin. This is what I cannot explain.
