If you need a profissional BTC dealer in Brasil, to sell bitcoins for a fair price. You can count on me. Next month I will be able to operate very large volumes.

Yes, that's so strange. Estonia is so modern in several aspects. Even the eResidency thing. How come they are against btcoin? Really non sense. BTW, thanks for the link! I will stay away from them.

Making more bank transactions and of an unusual amounts is not a crime, not in any country that I know about. lol
@_date: 2016-04-16 00:11:04
Banks are only oblige to immediately communicate transactions that are over 10k euros. The other suspicious activities are only recorded in an internal file, as far as I know. So... in someway that could avoid the alerts to get to the highest levels. But you are right about raising more suspicions for the fact of having numerous accounts. Anyway, if they investigate me they won't find a thing... I don't do anything wrong.

Banks and financial authorities will use any excuse to prohibit what threatens their supremacy. France is already trying to ban bitcoin by saying it is used to finance terrorists. That's a joke... really. The Paris and Belgium attackers were French and Belgium citizens. They would have money to buy their explosives no matter if bitcoin exists or not. The real threat is inside, not outside.
@_date: 2016-04-15 23:30:33
No... you didn't get my point. Normally when I make repetitive or fast transaction over a certain amount (let's say 2k), banks have automatic alerts and call me to ask for the origin of the funds. But as the funds come from bitcoins, it is quite hard to explain to them what it really is. Even though it is totally legal. So I thought if I open more bank accounts I could reduce the values of transactions in each bank, and finally I would have less red flags.
@_date: 2016-04-16 08:35:21
Because I have read stories about guys with huge legal problems for doing similar things. And because no matter if what I do is legal. My bank activity will raise red flags to the money laundering authorities. 
@_date: 2016-04-15 23:55:11
You don't understand. I am not talking about being ASKED. I am talking about having my bank account blocked, about being unfairly investigated for crimes I don't plan to commit. For instance, I have read many news articles about guys in many different countries who had their funds seized by authorities, and were facing judges, just because they were trading bitcoin. Trading is not money laundry. BTW instead of controlling rich people who are sending billions to Panama, financial authorities are actually investigating people like me, who declare all revenues and who will only make small 2k - 5k transactions. And finally, you don't seem to know what money laundry is. Money laundry is dissimulating the origin of the money. I never intended to do so. I only want to be able to make more bank transaction and in higher volumes, without being red flagged as a potential drug dealer. Am I clear now?
@_date: 2016-04-15 23:27:32
Yes. That's exactly what I think. But are there tax offices specialized in bitcoins already? This is probably a very uncommon issue.
@_date: 2016-04-15 23:32:32
I totally plan to declare my incomes. That is not my concern. My concern is more like how my activity could be feasible. Because if banks would be asking me about my transactions every day, and red flagging me for every 2k - 5k transaction, than it really becomes impossible. I just want a way to freely operate a bank account as much as I want...

@_date: 2016-04-15 23:37:45
Gilbert really got my point. I want to make legal arbitrage transactions. I will declare every revenue I make. The problem here is not illegality, it is feasibility. I want to make an extra monthly income, without opening a company only for that. What I want to do is not different from trade the stock market... 
@_date: 2016-04-15 23:58:37
Yes, I agree, but in my arbitrage transaction consist of convert bitcoins to real money at some point. And when we need to transfer real money we still need banks, right?
@_date: 2016-04-15 23:41:18


Well, it is not a bad idea. It is probably what all multinationals do in some way. But in that case I would need to open an export company only for this matter. And how I would move so many goods across countries if I don't travel myself every month / every week?  But I enjoy very much your creativity!

It doesn't mean BTC-e did really hack stuff. They could simply be doing money laundry fro Mark Karpeles. We are about to discover all that! I think within two years max we will know who got the coins. Alternatively, the BTCe guys will keep 5 years with the mouth shut in jail. Let's wait and see if police find something that they can't deny.

With Japan considering Bitcoin a real currency, even if all countries in the world ban bitcoin, we will still have a refugee with our Japanese friends. Bitcoin forever!
@_date: 2017-09-11 08:33:44
You are right. I have taken Bloomberg as an official source, just because it is Bloomberg. BTW, let's wait for a comment from the Central Bank...
@_date: 2017-09-11 08:30:23
You have a good point. If OTC actually gets over exchanges, it might be a good thing for bitcoin. Less volatility will be good for the entire community. Except for traders who make big money out of price jumps.
@_date: 2017-09-11 08:29:15
Ok, I guess the grammar mistakes will stay than. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 14:09:24
Ok, thanks for the information. I actually couldn't read the entire article, because I don't have a WSJ account. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:15:58
As long as Japan keeps it legal, and recognized as a currency, bitcoin will remain. I wish to see an official recognition of cryptos in Europe. That would be the greatest news ever. But yeah... it sucks, I will have to wait til the end of the month to start buying again.
@_date: 2017-09-18 14:12:06
Is that information on the article?
@_date: 2017-09-18 14:11:35
Sure! I think even if they make the activity of buying and selling btc illegal. People will still be able to do it (in small scale), with the help of OTC decentralized exchanges, without the government being able to control it. The problem would be to trade big volumes. Those money transactions would be difficult to justify. The only way for the chinese gov not be able to control it, would be OTC markets dealing with cash money.
@_date: 2017-09-11 08:24:45
this one came out today. Is that considered "old"?
@_date: 2017-09-11 08:35:58
I know... But I wish I could edit the title to be more accurate. I am still kind of panicking with the news. I sold 70% of my cryptos because of that. And I am waiting for more info.
@_date: 2017-09-11 08:24:24
How do I edit my post title? I can't find it.
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:46:44
Well, I do think China could completely forbid bitcoin exchanges. But what they can't stop is decentralized exchanges. A new era of decentralization has to begin. As long as people believe in Bitcoin, and governments don't consider OTC trading as a crime, BTC will keep on thriving. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 08:32:24
I admit I had given too much importance to this news, just because it is Bloomberg. Wish I could edit the title. But it is not possible. Let's wait and see if there is more info on the subject. Personally I sold all my BTCs while waiting for an official comment on the whole thing.
@_date: 2017-09-18 12:45:26
What about OTC trading, like we do on LocalBitcoins or LakeBTC? Will those websites be prohibited also? Will decentralized exchanges be a possibility?
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:56:34
It seems you wil be able to recover your BTCs. Now your biggest problem is taxes. If you are not american, you could move to Portugal. There you will benefit from 0 taxes during 10 years, on all the profits you have made outside the country. If not, just start thinking about giving 1/3 of your money to the state (or more).

Jaxx is a good wallet. The only case in which it is not a good option is to receive mining profits. In this case the wallet can bug badly, but the issue is openly stated by developers. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:31:46
Yes, it scared me for some seconds. After checking exchanges prices I realized it was probably a bug.
