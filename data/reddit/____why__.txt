Ah okay I see,  thanks for the reply.
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:53:03
Thanks! I will look at the options. That's what I was thinking too, like those smaller safes someone could just pick up and carry away.

This sub is swimming in articles, read some if them.

Same thing happened to me, I thought my bank was to blame even though I'm at a credit union and have never had issues with them before. Hoping it will dip again so I can try to rebuy.

Can you explain what you mean by your last sentence?
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:51:33
Not yet! Will do this tomorrow. I'm just getting it all figured out.
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:51:54
Okay, thanks that's a good idea.

I have not done this but I would be interested to know if it works out for you. I also wonder how much they are able and willing to regulate this.

Ah okay I see. So the actual device isn't the important part,  the seed is what's needed for recovery even of that particular nano device were to go missing or get damaged. Thanks

This is an amazing connection.  Both Trump and Ver will bring on their own demise, all they need to do is keep talking nonsense.

Thanks! Checking it out rn

Oh yeah I wrote it down but just once.
@_date: 2018-05-02 12:44:16
Told myself I wasn't going to buy any more and just wait a few months but I got a little bit more when it dipped under 9k

When I lived in Kenya about 6 years ago everyone was sending each other money mpesa phone to phone. You could pick your cash up in most grocery or convenience stores. I bet Bitcoin is huge because people want to have control of their own money. Government is very corrupt.

Idk what bank you have but mine would not let the transaction through either and would send me an insufficient funds note.
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:19:49
Amazing. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 13:06:21
You mean how it's also labeled BTC?
@_date: 2018-04-02 12:37:13
I am so happy to wake up to some green today

Woke up on the East coast to BTC @ $9,300. Good morning on the up and up! 
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:26:12
