same here, also wondering
@_date: 2013-04-24 11:20:25
Seriously, take a chillpill.
The market has blown up, their main focus obv has to be on other areas rite, the fact that people have to wait 2-3weeks for cashouts is not a problem and its very understandable, think about it.

Jesus, I can feel that anger through my screen..
Bet you are loving the fact that Mt.gox is adding litecoin to their platform soon :)
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:32:30
I made a post about this very topic a couple hours ago, I worry that this information isnt more easily available. there will be a surge of people who panick because of this and dont realise that they have to repeately backup their .dat file every 100 transfer or so because of this.
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:41:13
I'm going to carefully suggest that the issue most likely is with your bank..
@_date: 2013-11-20 08:03:09
wondering same
@_date: 2013-04-24 05:51:22
That sucks man, feel for you :(
I dont know much but maybe you sent a backup to your email and someone somehow got access to it?
Given that you had a tw-factor-ident, maybe has to be this.
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:51:06
Already did it ;)
Would encourage everyone else to do the same
@_date: 2013-12-08 09:26:26
haha, made my day!

Did you just compare LTC to Quark? What the actual fuck..
@_date: 2013-04-08 09:10:41
wow thats super wierd
@_date: 2013-03-27 03:09:51
This is just how it has to be for now, given the potential and how it might "change the world"
Once the true potential is a little more mapped it will stabilize 
@_date: 2013-03-24 22:20:58
Wow I cant listen to this, its on such a high level of unbelievable ignorance. Why would anyone make a video talking about something they clearly know nothing about?
-Bitcoin is new, ofcourse the market is going to be volatile, however at one point when the potential is a little more mapped out it will stabilize obviously.
-There is a difference between MT.Gox and Bitcoin in general, what one exchange service requires in identification and fees is irrelevant in the long run. People can and will always be able to trade bitcoins anonymously and send cash almost instantaneously anywhere, without the fairs and restrictions with "real currencies"
@_date: 2013-04-27 05:36:33
yup thanks, I tried the same also now. I can relax again :)

I had a drive fail on me a while back and the actual cause was the connection  to the inner hardisc that had become faulty or something, the hardisc itself was fine. There is still hope, but dont rush into something, you could harm the disc further.

This sounds so staged.. 1mill payday for admin?
@_date: 2013-05-15 14:31:48
Thats not the correct way of looking at it though, in fact they are cutting of one of the ways people buy Bitcoins which indeed is not a good sign.

@_date: 2013-04-03 09:30:51
you need to place it within the bitcoin folder (normally its hidden so youll also need to click on "view hidden files and folders" in control panel)
BTW, remember to move/copy the .dat file thats already there, moving the old one in will replace and possibly delete the current one forever, so be carefull and make a copy if needed.
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:39:48
I think you're a bit off here. The fact that we will have to use smaller denominations of Bitcoin wont be what bring Litecoin in. But rather the fact that people are more inclined to see it as a way to diversify the investing risk and also because the market has decided that we need more than 1 cryptocurrency to keep the Bitcoin developers in check. Without Litecoin etc, they would have even more power. So its in our all best interest that Litecoin does well and therefor it probably it will.
@_date: 2013-12-11 10:25:14
u bough quarks for 9 bitcoin? lol..
Hope they figure it out, but regardless ull end up losing those so whats the point
Ohh, u sold quarks? in that case I got it wrong

Guys, this guy killed bitcoin, its clear now, its a game. lolz
@_date: 2013-04-23 20:27:37
looks great! doesnt show up in appstore tho unfortunately 
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:48:45
well if you get the cashout to your bank account you don't really have much choice, especially if its a medium/large sum.
Also, i if you ever get audited later, they will look back as much as 10years I believe and you could end up getting taxed 50% or something. + fine/jail
Not to mention that its been the hot story of the year, they might prioritize bitcoin company related transaction in order to familiarize themselves with this area to see percentage of legit uses and such.
I believe you will have to pay gain tax, only country where its not taxable is south Korea I believe.
@_date: 2013-11-15 13:53:50
I don't think that would be feasible. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:41:31
It is not.
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:48:41
It matters bc China has/had like 60% of the coins and a huge stake into mining..
Of course the market will react accordingly, so many coins stuck there, no fiat coming in.. Price has to fall. 
China was bitcoins nr.1 customer, with tons of potential etc. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:13:30
We simply sense and intercept "waves of movement" as sound. For the tree to fall, it has to ofcourse move.. therefor there answer is:
Yes, but only if there is something there to "transform those waves into sound" 
For there to be "sound" someone needs to hear, if not its technically not sound. In other words, there is really no "sound" anywhere in the way people think there is, we just interpret it like that. MINDBLOWN

I agree. Think you misunderstood the my problem a little though, all funds are in my possesion, however blockchain displays the wrong amount when i do a search on the adresses, this happens because of the thing I edited within my post. It explains what has happend ;)

Most likely the site was not hacked
@_date: 2013-05-25 05:13:38
isnt this a scam?
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:39:19
It wont be possible. Just like banks in some countries are not allowed to send payments to poker sites, even though those sites are located abroad. This is in essence the same thing, the banks will obviously get instructions to not facilitate gox transfers etc. (if not, then whats the point of the ban)
And China has these currency transfer rules making max amount u can send out approx 3k I believe
@_date: 2013-04-27 05:26:30
Thanks, but already transferred the coins out.
Do u know if this has to mean that the person got hold of my login details? or can that blockchain email get sent for some other reason? maybe it just means that someone just tried a random password.. very important that I figure this out
the email says this:
Authorize log-in attempt
An attempt to login to your blockchain.info wallet was made from an unknown browser. Please confirm the following details are correct:

Jesus, this is getting absurd almost at the point where its boarderline scammy.
Get the fuck out of r/bitcoin
all ripple does is to try and take advanage of the "crypto boom" and move people that is coming in onto their centralized platform so the founders can get rich. period.
In a world with a well established bitcoin economy there would be ZERO need for ripple and there is ZERO need for them now.. 
If your buying ripples/xrp your basically buying tokens from a company that has, how many like a billion premade tokens..
You guys are obviously smart, why go about it this way? you could have made great services and been a part of Bitcoin, instead you made this shit
@_date: 2013-12-14 21:14:20

@_date: 2013-04-08 14:58:35
I cant wait until there are some legit, "idiot proof" auto sync storage alternative, without it there is just no way of feeling good about it.
Sure coldstorage is technically the safest, but it just doesnt feel like a good solution for the non technical regular person.
my advice would be:
1. encrypt the wallet
2. make backups
3. Make more backups every time after about 50 transfers'
4. Keep those backups offline on USB sticks
5. have one in your car or in a bankbox (make sure everything cant go down in a fire or something)
6. Do not forget the password and do not keep it with the backups
7. If you have a substantial amount, DO NOT access your wallet on your regular computer. There will be a flood of new viruses and keyloggers injected into what will seem like legitimate bitcoin websites that you might happen to visit.

Is the all almighty Max Keiser really supporting these scammers? I dont get it, why would anyone invest into a coin that a handlful of developers own 98% of..

This is so wierd, blockexplorer says correct x recieved and x sent, however at the end it says my balance is -0,5 of what bitcoinqt shows
so both blockchain and blockexplorer has the correct stats, but display -0,5
btw I used the blockchain shared transfer to fund the balance

@_date: 2013-12-18 12:07:36
That timing :)
@_date: 2013-12-14 21:17:35
Its worth whats its worth primarily because the market has accepted it as bitcoins little brother. There has to be a second coin to keep the devs and others in check.
The only ones who will (maybe) get rich on quark are the devs/scammer who has orchestrated this whole thing, from the 95% "pre-mine" to the media campaign. Then as soon as they start to sell, the market will remain flat in best case scenario. Or do u think they will just sit on that 95% ? :)
@_date: 2013-04-08 06:17:12
private individuals cant print money or control fiat, governments however can. The fact that "printing" bitcoins is impossible is a MAJOR incentive for rich guys to place funds in it.
@_date: 2013-04-24 21:46:44
Yeah, I undrestand it can be annoying. Its just a volume thing, they are to small and bitcoin has grown to fast. 20k people signing up each day and 20mill being deposited, its almost unheard of.
@_date: 2013-04-27 07:06:42
