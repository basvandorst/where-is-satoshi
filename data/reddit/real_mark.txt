Believe it or not, “No one ever went broke taking profits” is misleading and bad advice. This is because people tend to sell profits early and ride our losses hoping for a recovery. The result is not only huge opportunity costs, but overall market loss. It’s the exact reason why most people are not good at playing the market and end up with losses, even if they pick more winners than losers.

There are a few reasons:
1. In a volatile bull market, it's difficult to determine the bottom of FUD induced market falls. Thus, unless you are working at it on a consistent basis, as an experienced analyst, it's easy to make a mistake and lose bitcoin by selling at the wrong time. It's easier to hold and buy the dip.
2. With the exception of the Mt. Got incident, every fall has, within a few months, recouped itself and then multiplied returns by year end.
3. If a lot of people hold, you are making a scarce resource even more scarce. This is what happened with gold and why gold is so much more valuable than silver despite having twice as much investor grade gold on the market than silver. The difference in utility between gold and silver is negligible.

I didn’t mention scarcity, because it was implied, and of course scarcity (supply) and demand are the two forces at play. My point is that demand is not directly dependent on utility, It is provable that it is not so by the silver vs gold prices with silver being not only more rare, but more useful, and thus higher utility. 
And you are wrong about the fiat dollar. The dollar gets 100% of its value as a contract. This contract is enforced by the US government. It is this enforcement which is a service that protects the value of the dollar. The dollar itself has no intrinsic value, which is what I meant. There is of course, value in the contract which is enforced. But it doesn’t have to be a paper dollar. It could be any monetary instrument, including bitcoin. So a dollar has no value as a dollar, only as an enforced contract. Bitcoin, on the other hand, does have intrinsic value (i.e. utility), because the ledger service is self-enforced.

While bitcoin has uses, it can be measured and transferred without a trusted third party, and is thus a useful banking ledger service, you are wrong to think that usefulness alone is somehow necessary for something to have value or even be used as money. Dollars have no use whatsoever and aren’t backed by anything of use, but we “use” them anyway. There’s no use case for a dollar without faith in the products and services which accept it. We just all agree to to a dollar’s measure. It is this agreement between people and institutions that hold value, not the usefulness of the dollar itself. 
Furthermore, even if we were to look at gold, and compare it to silver, we see this agreement to hold gold as a store of value has far more impact on the price of the metal than the usefulness of the metal. It is this agreement that drives demand, not the use of the metal. The ONLY advantage gold has over silver is that gold doesn’t oxidize. That’s it. And it’s purely aesthetic. However, silver is both far more rare than gold by weight (not by volume), and silver is also far more useful than gold as it can be used in energy storage and transfer applications as the best metal in its class. Not to mention It’s just as malleable for jewelry. Despite there only being about one ton of investor grade silver on the market, compared to two tons of investment grade gold, silver is still worth only between 1 and 2% the price of gold by weight. 
@_date: 2019-03-29 07:36:59


That is provably wrong. 
I’m not sure you comprehend what I wrote. 
If utility drives demand, silver would be worth more than twice as much as gold because there is twice as much gold on earth (by weight) and silver has more utility than gold. Let me repeat: **THERE IS LESS SILVER THAN GOLD AND DESPITE THE FACT SILVER HAS MORE UTILITY THAN GOLD, SILVER IS ONLY 1-2% THE PRICE OF GOLD. **
This indicates that something other than utility is driving the demand for gold. What is that, then? I will repeat: The banks all made an agreement to hoard gold as a reserve. Such agreement was a far more important factor to the price of gold than its utility. 
I’m not saying utility is not a driver to the value or price of something, just that utility is not necessarily the primary driver of demand. In fact, scarcity itself can drive demand. Agreements can drive demand. Perceptions can drive demand. Aesthetics can drive demand. Entertainment and media can drive demand. None of those things are utility. Utility alone is actually a very small driver to the value or price of an object. 


This is a statement based on your incorrect assumption that utility is the primary driver of price and value. It is not. Gold is valued aesthetically for jewelry over silver because gold doesn’t tarnish and has an appealing color. That is not utility. The utility involved is malleability, which gold and silver have equally. In this case, aesthetics drive the value of gold over silver. If people were to suddenly care more about the patina of oxidized silver over gold, then demand for silver would rise. That’s not a utility of silver. It’s a perception of beauty that society values and is 100% cultural choice. A utility DOES something. And silver is THE BEST metal for batteries. So that’s something! Why is it, when malleability is the same, silver having better energy properties than gold, gold is more expensive? Aesthetics and the banking reserve agreements. That’s it. Not utility. 


Do you know what intrinsic value means? Do you know what a bond is? Bitcoin is not a debt instrument and therefore can not be a bond. Bitcoin is a service commodity, and as such is equity. Bitcoin has intrinsic value as a self-regulating and self-enforced ledger service. That is built in value to the bitcoin system.

FTA: “First, we define any Turing complete program to be a program that halts.”
That’s not a good definition of Turing completeness. A program is Turing complete if it can simulate any Turing machine. For example, your computer OS doesn’t necessarily halt (unless you instruct it to), but is Turing complete and can simulate another OS that doesn’t halt. Bitcoin script can’t simulate your OS, because it can’t loop and must halt.
Edit: I should also note that just because a program halts, doesn’t mean it is Turing complete either. Consider the case of a simple calculator that can only do addition with 8bit numbers and a program that adds every number. Such a machine is not able to imitate all Turing machines and is not universal, yet it halts.

Why is it whenever someone is asked about the intrinsic value of bitcoin, they freeze? The answer is simple: it’s a trustless automated service network. Each transaction is made possible by the intrinsic value of the system and its economy. Each bitcoin is a measure of service, a banking service.

Someone exploited a code bug in Ethereum and stole money with the intention for use as another purpose. He also said he did not intend to return the money, and was thus a "bad actor" or thief. Yes, the code was written wrong, so he claimed that the code was law and that he had every right to exploit the bug. The Ethereum community, for the most part disagreed with him; the believed that there was intent behind the contract and that the bug had a right to be fixed. So they decided to implement a hard fork to return the funds stolen to the userbase.
That said, that would be impossible to do with Bitcoin because it is far more decentralized and requires an impossible amount of resources to implement. Ethereum was only able to reorganize the blockchain because it was clear to most of the miners that those funds were stolen, and did not rightfully belong to the attacker. When this was going on, I sided more with the Ethereum classic (the attacker, because i believe in immutable contracts) side, but today, I believe both blockchains offer value, one a social contract of contract intent, the other of complete immutability.

This analysis doesn’t really account for bitcoin being fractional. Let’s assume you’re correct in everything but your conclusion that no one will spend it. As a deflationary asset, you can live off of the gains while holding the rest, as long as others still accept the coin. 
Let’s say in 20 years, one bitcoin is worth 500k at a deflationary rate of 5% in today’s dollars. 5% of 500k is 25k per bitcoin. So as long as you spend less than 25k per bitcoin in bitcoin, you will still make money even as your overall bitcoin reserves deplete. So people will probably still spend it, but the liquid market will be a small fraction of the total market.

10 years is feasible, but a bit close. 20, I would say that’s more likely. There does not exist “quantum supremacy” quite yet, but we are close. Quantum supremacy is when some quantum computer is faster than any classical one. 
Also, for someone to break discrete log with a quantum computer, with the number of bits in BTC encryption (256 bit encryption), you need at least 512 quantum bits.  The number of Qubits required to pull off the encryption breaking algorithm is staggeringly high and a very difficult, perhaps impossible engineering problem. Right now, the best quantum chip on the world has only 72 qubits. That’s about enough to factor a 36 bit number using Shor’s algorithm. (Requires 2registers, hence the doubling on the number of qubits required, might be able to double capacity with two chips, I don’t know for sure). 
We might be ten years away at the very closest, but I think 20 years is a more reasonable target.

But, honestly, I think enough time has passed where people have a much better grasp than we give credit for, and that this notion that it's impossible to understand what happens in a quantum system, has become a bit of a roadblock to the philosophy of physics and development of conceptual notions and alternative interpretations.

Thor requires a payment to open a channel. They do accept alts, but that means bitcoin becomes dependent on other chains to scale. In other words, payments made to open your channel with Thor can't all be done in bitcoin, so the scaling is dependent on outside chains. This is only a problem if those chains are susceptible to 51% attacks, but one of bitcoin's biggest selling point right now, compared to any alt, is that it's PoW is extremely secure. By relying on alts to scale, we are forming a weak link in the PoW security chain. I, of course have no idea if this can be hacked, but if someone were to say, accept for example, ETC to open a channel with bitcoin LN, and then reorg ETC (since ETC already experienced a reorg, I think this is plausible.), this would essentially steal from the channel opening service. And we haven't even approached channel settlement, we are only talking about opening channels, for every channel open, you're eventually going to have to close the channel and settle on chain. If everyone is always doing that, it can't happen without a race to highest fees, until a better on chain scaling solution is found. Doesn't have to be big blocks, I'm not for perma-big blocks, just as a temporary solution so that the user isn't capped like they were during the last bull run.

The whole point of this thread, if you can’t understand it, is that to open the lightning network channel, you’re going to have to pay a $10-20 fee or maybe higher. So lightning network can’t fix the on chain fees when people are all trying to open up channels. If everyone in America opened a LN channel, that would be 300,000,000 channels to open. At the current rate of 7 open channels per second, it would take over 81 years to open all those channels. That means to open a channel when the world is trying to use it will cost a premium if you want it to happen before you die. 
This means it’s going to cost ten, twenty, fifty, maybe hundreds of dollars to open a channel, which means we are cutting poor people out of the system, and that is definitely not what I believe bitcoin was ever about. Anyone, at anytime, should be able to send bitcoin to anyone for a low fee. 
Now, I’m not saying big blocks are the answer, just that by not adding MB to the current situation, we are creating a huge barrier to entry that is not in the best interests of everyone in the world. 
If bitcoin is going to be “it” as digital gold or currency or even a store of value, it’s going to have to temporarily increase the block size before someday implementing some sort of zero knowledge proof or sharding to minimize the throughput as is the intention for decentralized mining operations. This increase will allow a growing userbase a seemless scaling solution and keep low fees while a long term plan is implemented.
