In the world of your emotional coherence. People ranting like you usually got burned by a horse they bet on, lost, feel tricked, scream at the wind.

But that would imply that we need a solution ready for scaling ... and we don't want that here ... right?

The question also is if 's description of how sidechains work is viable or at least based on scientific facts. I personally couldn't judge this.
Also, yes. No cultism, please.

lol, no shit? I am still waiting for the day a captain of industry, politician or else walks up and with a straight face says, 'You know what? I think I am *too much* in control of something.'

Why does everything have to be ultimate when Bitcoin is concerned? I believe that some nuances between stagnation and total breakdown of the world of money as we know it do exist. Let's see what impact things like 21.inc have over time, shall we.

Compared to Schiff, who loves gold in an irrational way that borders on sexual obession, Faber's opinion stands to reason. Also did you lose a lose a lot of money if you followed Schiff's financial advice since 2008.

How many people care about this, or even understand what it means? Reversibility obviously has clear advantages too.

It *seems* like a *real lie*. Nice semantics there, dude.

I coinsider this a low estimate.
@_date: 2016-01-07 17:41:20
Yes, it's all relative. Schiff though is pretty much a delusional fanatic when it comes to gold. He preached hyperinflation after 2008 for consecutive years. 
I'd rather not be infected by such extremism and listen to Faber and others.

Actually he is an advisor and fund manager.
