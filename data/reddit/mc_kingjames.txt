There's no helping some people

bitcoin took from 2009 to 2017 to fill 1mb blocks... get with reality 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:41:38
wrong, you have to break the usability of something to make it worth something. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:17:46
what would really suck is if they thing they're buying into peer to peer electronic cash system and got stuck with bcore.

Lightning network won't solve on blockchain tx fees
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:15:22
bitcoin was supposed to have bigger block size. the 1mb cap was implemented to solve and early problem of spam transactions. it is as if we had our leg broken and when that healed we refused to take the cast off. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:04:04
right, because limiting the block size to what it was from 2009 to 2017 will totally help with exponential growth... unless you want exponentially growing tx fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:21:14
wrong, that isn't how the bitcoin.com wallet works. you get both the bitcoin and bitcoin cash wallets linked to the same addresses. you literally can not lose bitcoin or bitcoin cash by making that mistake with his wallet. it was made to protect us against that very thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:47:52
it doesn't have a value as a currency if spending it costs more in tx fees than what you are purchasing. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:44:02
we don't need it today, we just passed up the need for 1mb blocks, we are not anywhere remotely near needing 10gb blocks... 
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:38:14
well, if you don't it goes to the mempool to die in 14 days. 
also, that's just your opinion, man. if it's not on the blockchain it never happened. that's like keeping you bitcoin on an exchange and then when you get mtgoxed being like "i never saw that coming"
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:47:30
this would just make it illegal for bitcoin exchanges to not disclose all their customers, not come after your personal accounts. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:32:58
right, paying $10 tx fees to buy $5 beers. working just fine...
people are starting to take notice and it will not be good once the speculators realize how inefficient bitcoin has become. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:19:04
'member the good old days when you could send 2 btc for pennies and it would confirm in 10 minutes? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:50:27
Ouch 
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:03:52
No, it really isn't; the problem is bitcoin needs to scale to meet demand, Satoshi originally went with a 32mb block, however in the early days spam transactions were a problem so the block size was made to be 1mb. Now that the problem of spam is not an issue we need to increase the block size to meet the demand, not necessarily going up to 32mb blocks, but maybe 2mb blocks.   
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:39:16
Or if you go back to the fork, or pretty much anything other than the past week where bch has held steady at about 1200 after shooting up from 300
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:57:58
no it is not, are we going to all raid Jaxx, Coinami, etc. and downvote them too for being a multi crypto wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:58:36
down with multi-coin wallets!!!
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:14:00
The backlog issue was happening before bcash was a thing, same with the high transaction fees. It was the reason for segwit...
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:10:10
Exactly, never use a coinbase account for anything but buying Bitcoin on coinbase and immediately moving it to your own wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:07:10
bitcoin cash has outperformed bitcoin core in the last month... but don't let facts get in the way of your narrative.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:29:59
nice fake news
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:18:08
not a bad time to do that
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:54:31
that's a conservative estimate 
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:53:44
And you probably did that when it was around a few hundred losing out on thousands of dollars too, huh? Is that what the butthurt with this sweet wallet is really all about?
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:19:53
There's nothing hidden about it, Trojans don't tell you what they're doing...
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:50:21
It's in the description on the application, there is no surprise about it at all. Have you even looked at the application or it's description?
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:25:12
When you click receive it displays the same address for both BTC and BCH. This app is so idiot proof it's not even funny. If you get sent BTC it goes to your BTC wallet, if you get sent BCH it goes to your BCH wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:08:29
people are complaining because it provides support for both bitcoin core and cash on the same addresses making it so you won't accidentally send you core to a cash wallet and vice versa. this makes people mad for some reason. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:09:35
that isn't how it works at all. it creates both a btc and bch wallet with the same addresses to ensure you don't make a stupid mistake and lose your btc or bch. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:48:23
people spending/selling bitcoin is not an attack, bitcoin just can't handle being a currency anymore...
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:14:18
Both wallets are clearly labeled, you're creating an issue out of nothing. It's like being mad at coinami for BCH support. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:30:08
just look at Bcash, they increased the blocksize instead of segwit and the issue of a giant backlog and huge transaction fees is nonexistent, this proves bigger block sizes are the answer to the problem and that needs to be addressed quickly before people abandon bitcoin for bcash entirely, which has already begun. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:23:01
i hope it goes back to 100, i could use some more
@_date: 2017-10-17 23:33:54
That would depend on of electrum will have a splitting tool, but yeah, definitely don't ever keep Bitcoin on an exchange. Ever. 
That's how mt.gox robbed a bunch of people back in the early days.
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:51:01
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:05:16
not a bad idea at all
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:08:25
Pretty much, you can import the same keys into a wallet that supports the forked coin.
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:07:48
i wish i was making that much
@_date: 2017-10-18 00:51:54
That's why you always hold your private keys
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:07:19
not necessarily 
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:31:04
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:41:28
i wish i had everything in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:34:16
you are not too late, one bitcoin and hodl and your kids will thank you 
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:55:46
what wallet address? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:58:43
when bitcoin hits half a million in a few years that $10 will be $1,000, why not? 
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:02:51
i don't know, $5,000,000 worth of bitcoin seems like it could be a bit close to fuck you money.
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:47:53
Vertcoin is where it's at, its the future. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:03:48
ouch, and i thought reformatting my phone with 1.7 bitcoin on it was bad. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:55:30
that's not how this works, that's not how any of this works!
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:22:25
i should have listened to myself lol 
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:58:57
wait, did i miss something here? is this clown pretending to be satoshi?
