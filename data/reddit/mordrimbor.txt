This is the funniest thing I've read all day.

So, like the Iphone 3g? Expecting those to go up in price too? Technology gets real old, real fast, and early models get replaced quickly. There is nothing BTC does that isn't done better by another crypto, and that's even assuming crypto does something worth doing. There is no inherent value to BTC, and it's severely outdated as a platform.


Yes, it very clearly mimicks just about every other bubble in the history of the market. It's in a major downtrend. There is absolutely no logical reason to expect a recovery.


No, *you* will see who is right here, eventually and far too late. *We* know who is right.

I predicted the crash back when it was soaring up to 20k. I forecast the bottom at 5k, and while we didn't quite get there, we got damn close. I'm not going anywhere, and neither is BTC. It's in a long-term decline and it is near to death.

Then you're disabled.


Yes, clearly disabled. 
We were talking about a specific iteration of technology. We're not talking about Apple. We're not talking about iPhones in general. Neither of those are corrolaries to BTC. You cannot buy stock in BTC. BTC is not a company. BTC is one iteration of a particular technology, and an old model at that. BTC is the iPhone 3g, and equally outdated.


Correct. You don't seem to know what a bubble is. People can absolutely make money in bubbles, but it's made in a volatile and speculative fashion based in no actual value that ultimately zeroes out. 


I'm guessing you don't really understand anything.

You mean you don't think that there could possibly be a smaller number of people buying lots of bitcoin, and a large number of people only lightly invested selling small amounts each to get out? You think there's some natural law enforcing a 1-to-1 exchange?
@_date: 2018-08-28 07:41:03


I think there are more people selling than buying, and most sales are going to speculators or trading companies. 


I don't think you know how markets work. 


That's the point. A ton of low-quantity holders got out after the crash, and their small amounts of coin primarily went to high-quantity holders, which are fewer in number.

No reading comprehension there. You know the difference between quantity and quality, right? Please learn to read.

You're high. This is just like any other technology. New stuff comes out, old stuff dies out. No one is using the iPhone 3g. Bitcoin is as old as the iPhone 3g, and there have been even more "models" of cryptocurrency released afterwards than there have been iPhones. Bitcoin has absolutely no technical value in the crypto market. 


It has always been a bubble.

They already came, and left their shit.

I mean, history, technical analysis, and common sense are on my side, but good luck on your hodl.
