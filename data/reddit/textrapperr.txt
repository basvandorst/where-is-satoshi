That is pure speculation, no direct evidence that happened. They also sold 2/3 of their etc (of which they only started with 1.1 million etc) maybe into btc? Also they have other avenues for earning money, DEVcon, sponsorship, shapeshift integration into mist so perhaps these actions earned some btc. That ether is not a store of value is FUD. Maybe the foundation believes ether and Bitcoin move in opposite directions so smart to hold at least some btc so that development is not hindered by a worst case scenario. And they hold ETH, btc, and fiat. Btc is the lowest percentage wise
Also lets not forget that the foundation got burned when their 18 million usd Bitcoin reserve shrunk to 9 million due to a btc crash. They are a big organization and some diversification is prudent to ensure the ability to pay for on-going operations

No, it's my way of trying to tell him that no one wants to read his book. Why do I know this? Bc people don't want to read any books not even good books anymore. If someone wants to read a good book it's easy enough to pick up a classic. He should have fun writing it, but he should understand from the get go that no one wants to read it.

I don't mean to be a prick and have fun writing just know that no one wants to read your book, and that anyone who reads any of it will be doing so out of a sense of obligation, and will expect you to reward them in some way for reading any of it, even just hearing you mention the title they will want you to buy them lunch or something.

What's the last book you read? Book sales have been increasing of cookbooks, celebrity biographies, and self help books. No one will will read his fiction book without being paid to do so.
