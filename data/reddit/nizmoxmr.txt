These scammers are creative. Props, although it’s fucked up.

Way too many pussies in crypto.

Space cash. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:06:16
Maybe atomic swap will avoid that. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:26:17
Their deposit limit is pretty low. I couldn’t find how to get it higher than $500. I am verified too. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:48:11
Crypto to crypto is ridiculous. I don’t think that would be true. How about crypto to its own token? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:32:28
Kinda did with Space Cash. Applies to all types of currencies really.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:59:19
My deposit is still pending since Dec 4th! Took a day for support to just send me an email that says they'll get to me. That was a while ago, and still nothing. They haven't even taking out fiat from my bank yet. Worst thing is you can't just cancel it even though nothing has even happened yet.

When is the Dojo dropping?

Thought that was the guy from Harold and Kumar.

Great arbitrage opportunity. 
@_date: 2019-03-02 04:29:07
Wonder why they don’t allow coins to buy BTC.
@_date: 2019-03-21 03:36:54
Did you get verified an hour ago or did you submit the verification and hour ago?
@_date: 2019-03-21 03:39:06
You can buy bitcoin on there without any verification. Verification is for the withdrawals, so I’m thinking you’ll need to wait a day or two for them to complete your verification process.

I was looking into building my own node but ended up just getting a Casa Node. It’s expensive compared to buying the hardware yourself but it’s the software that makes it worth it. Got to say though, I Almost didn’t get the Casa just for that dumb looking Sata cable, but definitely happy with the purchase. 
@_date: 2019-02-27 23:05:46
Yup it will run both nodes at the same time. They also ship the unit with just about 99% of the blocks synced. This saved a lot of time. You can sync from 0% if you choose to though.
@_date: 2019-02-27 22:04:53
I didn’t go the RaspiBlitz route although looked into it. I decided to spend the extra money and buy a [Casa Node]( . Yes it more expensive than a RaspiBlitz setup but the software and ease of use make the purchase worthwhile. Their software is open source now also. 
Plugged it in, found the Node IP address to access it though my PCs browser, setup my passphrase seed and let it sync. You may have to forward ports, which would be the hardest thing of the whole setup. 
Got 5 LN channels open so far, haven’t bought my [LN Pizza]( yet though ��. 
Now I do believe Casa will be releasing their software for people that want to build their own node like you’re doing. Not sure when though. 
@_date: 2019-02-13 02:22:20
Just before you confirm the purchase it says what price you’ll be buying it at. I wish it was just on the main screen too. The price varies so much it just a guess to get it lowest of the day, so if you want some BTC just buy it. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 01:54:04
Depends on we’re you live but Coinbase, Gemini, and I believe Binance just started. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 21:18:31
Don’t you have to go BTC&gt;XMR&gt;Another XMR Wallet&gt; BTC?
@_date: 2019-02-13 01:13:52
Yup. I don’t think the verification process takes too long. Probably be able to send out BTC by tomorrow. 
@_date: 2019-02-13 01:10:39
Cash App? You’ll need to verify yourself to withdraw though. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 14:28:39
Here is a [list](  of some. 
Almost wanted to wait for the Samurai Dojo but went with the Casa. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 14:16:21
Soon as I get my Casa Node I’m getting some Dominos Pizza. 
@_date: 2019-02-14 00:42:23
Just bought my CasaNode yesterday! 2-4 week waiting time though ��
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:58:40
Even if it goes through it’ll still be 4-8 days before it goes into your account. Depending on how much you’re buying you might just want to do a wire transfer. Do it in the morning and you could have it later that day. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:39:02
There are many other coins to look into. If BTC gets to 16,000 thats good, but only 2x your investment.
@_date: 2019-02-17 03:17:43
He threw away around $85. Who the fuck cares.

Ledger Nano X which is coming out soon has some nice features. Bluetooth to the phone made me upgrade from the S. Will no longer need to drag my laptop around. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:02:58
Lol like I’m saying it’s bad. With this volatile market you get 2x you money pretty fast if you play it right. Many many coins that started under a penny this year are 10x what they started at. That’s what you want to invest it. Everyone only knows about bitcoin because of the news and most are ignorant. They have no clue there are more than one coin so they flock to bitcoin to make money, when if they did some research they’d see there is better tech out there than bitcoin and it’s a hell of a lot cheaper. Say what you want, I know what sub I’m in, any talk of other coins gets -karma. 
For instance UPfiring even tho it was an ICO started at $.02 and the next day over .40, almost to $.50.  If you don’t get greedy and are fine with a 20x return sell it. Boom, get that return with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 14:35:57
Yea I was iffy on the feature too. I’m sure they did their research on it, but we can probably disable Bluetooth altogether if need so. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:46:22
Yes it’s a gamble. Coinbase isn’t a scam, one of the easiest exchanges to use at a cost of fees. GDAX is where you want to be. I don’t know if you’ve looked around the crypto world but there are more coins than just Bitcoin. ETH, XMR, Dash , LTC, IOTA, OMG, LSK, Waves and many more. If you look into them you’ll see they are not all the same and many of them if you bought in the beginning of the year you would have over 4x your investment, some +2000%. For bitcoin to get you 4x your investment your looking at 32,000 per BTC. Not likely to happen soon. People have become millionaires off of alt coins. BTC is attractive because we’ve seen its success but it doesn’t mean it doesn’t have its risk. Go look at USDT and how it is fucking everything up. Also being on the bias sub people will not recommend other cryptos. They are not all shit coin many of them have tech that bitcoin doesn’t. IOTA for example has a different type of Blockchain called the tangle. The more transactions the faster it gets. Total opposite of the Blockchain of BTC. Ripple is hated on since they go against what crypto is supposed to be but there is a place for it and they are doing a hell of a job.

Looks like the guy in the Ram bought Bosch Coin. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 11:55:48
3-4 i believe. You can load/offloaded many  wallets apps as needed, this won’t delete your coins. Also tokens are stored in their coins wallet. Then the Ledger Blue holds a couple more. That Satosh White Paper Ledger Nano is nice.

I guess right now a big problem is keeping qbits in memory for a sustainable time. Who knows when they will solve it, so for foreseeable future we’re good.

A lot of changes requires a hard fork. Which they don’t want to do if they can prevent it. Best way to go about it is to create a private side chain which would be like a 2nd layer on top of Bitcoin.

If the BCH split gave you BCH then you should get SV with that BCH you got beforehand.

You’ll want to just look into trading as a whole not just crypto trading. This site is free and has a lot of good info. [Babypips](

[Hidden Secrets of Money]( is a good series. Now the guy does sell gold, it’s his business, but his videos are great. He also has a book. I watched these and I am also reading The Bitcoin Standard, and you see relations between the two talking about the history of money.
