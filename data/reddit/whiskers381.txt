No line rental then? We also get A higher than average ping :(. I probably wouldn't be able to switch. Thanks for the info tho. SKYs "on demand" service is also shocking. It advertises a free box to turn wireless into Ethernet for your sky box to then have the on demand feature. However if you already set up your sky box without it then they refuse to give it to you because "your device has had a internet access in the past" this is because a working telephone line is required for the set up. Not that the internet that they provide would be enough for a watchable film and that goes for the router they send too.

No matter what the subject is someone will always find a way to say comcast is shit. (I would love to join in but I don't live in the US but UK service sucks too)

Waw 20-30ms sounds great. I'll just sit here with my 40-60ms

That is just about the best image for Bitcoin I have ever seen.

With sky I get 400-600KBps down and 70KBps up. We get our cable through them so it apparently doesn't make sense to get a useable internet when theirs is so 'cheep' by comparison. Don't even ask why we get cable because IDK...
