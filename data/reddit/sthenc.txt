Can confirm this guy is not OP. Cannot confirm you should care. ;)

This gives me hope.

Why would bitcoin payments be useless without a discount? Even if it were slightly more expensive for some reason, I'd pay in bitcoin vs fiat.
Expedia takes credit card and also bitcoin. Are they violating their agreement?

Not at all. From what I can tell (albeit outside-in), they bake security deeply into their company at every level. That's particularly hard in a startup, when you need to be frugal with cash, increasing the temptation to cut corners on things like security that are difficult to quantify ROI on.

If you expect adoption to happen in one fell closed-loop swoop, you're kidding yourself. It will be baby steps, often starting with accepting bitcoin through an intermediary like Coinbase or Bitpay. And yes, that's good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-29 22:29:41
That's short-sighted. Increased utility will lead to increased adoption.
@_date: 2016-12-29 07:35:58
Maybe. Or maybe it struck a chord and Airbnb will start accepting bitcoin. We'll see.

Name a more secure hosted wallet.

21 impresses me in that they don't get caught up publicly in the drama. They just quietly build great things.

I wonder what neat doodles I've been missing out on since browsers started incorporating search functionality into the address bar.

Just remember to backfill after paying with bitcoin. ;)
@_date: 2016-12-29 22:31:23
Then do the same. :)
I think HODLing is the most important use case, but I do hope to see merchant acceptance for day-to-day things increase as well.

It's an informal poll based on replies/favorites/retweets on this thread.

I control my keys because I agree with that.
But my point is that it's a practical matter of risk management. Yes, you run a risk of an exchange taking or losing your coins by trusting them. But if you don't trust them, you have to take on the responsibility of storing them yourself. Depending on your individual circumstances and usage profile, a hosted wallet may be better. It is absolutely false that it is always better to store your own keys rather than use a hosted wallet.

The more I use it, the more businesses are encouraged to accept it. The more businesses that accept it, the less I need to involve fiat currency in my life.

Oh! Whew - I missed some context and thought you meant we needed &gt; 1MB. :)

You're amazing at missing the point.
@_date: 2016-12-28 07:30:36
Ah, gotcha. Yeah, I agree it would be nice for Coinbase's level of security or higher to be more common across exchanges. That'd be great for the ecosystem.
@_date: 2016-12-29 22:59:36
No, I mean increasing the utility of bitcoin. If all else were to remain static but tomorrow you could also travel with it, it'd be more useful.
I don't think this makes or breaks bitcoin by any means, but it would help. HODLing is the most important use case, but increased merchant adoption is nice, too.
@_date: 2016-12-30 21:23:14
Ridiculous. I'm not in love with everything Coinbase does, but they're great for bitcoin. They're the most secure hosted wallet IMO and an easy on-ramp for non-technical folks to get into the space. Those people can transfer coins elsewhere later if/when they get more comfortable. The ecosystem would be worse without Coinbase.
@_date: 2016-12-27 08:06:57
Coinbase is one of the most impressive companies I've seen in terms of technical security, bitcoin or otherwise.
