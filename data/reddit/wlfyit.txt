but this isn't a post with a link. and if it were the system would have told me a duplicate post existed. So basically i'm being patronised, even though no one can provide me proof that i've double posted.

I'm actually unable to locate this "original" post when searching under "eat" "eat24" or "eat24hours" or when looking at new posts. can someone link me?

I accept your "apology" 
@_date: 2014-01-10 19:59:18
Well no. I didn't see the original post. This is from my inbox. But really... you don't have to be a dick about it. This community really does have a problem...

Per your advice I deleted the text post. the "original" post everyone was talking about didn't show back up like you said it would. I reposted with the included blog link in hopes to locate the duplicate. the Reddit system, it seems, doesn't think this is a duplicate post as i was not blocked from a repost. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 20:59:54
based on your wording i find that hard to believe. 
i spend a lot of time lurking here. it might also be worth your time browsing so you know which posts are actually double posts.

The amount exceeds your balance...

an ill conceived attempt at referencing apple's little security problems it's been having as of late.

bitcoin-qt up to date with arch's repo.

sorry I'm frustrated... I do Systems Engineering in the heart of San Francisco, and my track record shows that I'm pretty good at hardening systems. My normal every day password is in excess of 30 characters. This one was in excess of 50.
But I realize you have no way of knowing that.

Edit: No.
Was running Arch.

1. Unfortunately today i learned i got punked
2. Yes its was for the wallet itself, it was specific to my wallet
3. I have a formula in my head that i use to make all my passwords to guarantee their are long and different on each service
4. See Above
5. Key based ssh only, no ports forewarded on firewall.
6. No this computer is basically dedicated for "secure" tasks, such as bitcoin, gpg, openssl, etc.
7. It is AES-Twofish-Serpent encrypted using truecrypt and lives in a safe
8. My friends are also VERY smart and mean.

I don't need to "prove" the fact that this happened to you.
@_date: 2013-05-09 02:40:12
what are alt coins?
@_date: 2013-05-09 01:02:05
So with the exception of backing up my wallet to an encrypted thumb drive I havn't done anything with them since I bought them around 9 months ago....
What could have happened?
@_date: 2013-05-09 02:39:13
well i'm forced to believe that clearly the "safe" computer is now not the safe computer since i am not offered any other explanation than someone took the wallet file directly off my computer.
i have already pulled the drives and have begun running virus checks on em. after i can safely hope the files are safe i'll back them up and rebuild.

That was meant to be a jab at Apple, I apologize if anyone felt it was directed at them. 
@_date: 2013-05-09 01:13:37
I love being talked down to!
