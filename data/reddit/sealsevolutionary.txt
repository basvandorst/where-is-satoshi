AFAIK, debit cards are also protected like credit cards are.  So the arguments against using credit are kind of moot.  You can use your debit card on "thousands of websites" and it still has protection does it not?

Setting up a meeting with a stranger, who may or may not show up at the designated time, can this be considered "frictionless"?  Besides the literal friction involved in walking / bicycling / using a vehicle to get there, there's the time involved , and that's a lot more inconvenient to me than using coinbase and paying the 1% vig.  Also, from what I can tell, if you use localbitcoins they always charge you a insane 10% markup.  So coinbase is actually cheaper and less friction than localbitcoins.  Then again, why am I arguing with someone who by their own admission is crazy for coins?

So you reviewed the Jalapeno, they sent you this mocking foam torch, and you didn't tell people about that?  
You are a piece of scum.

In vernacular, "nobody" really almost always means "almost nobody".
Also, don't we have to take Mr. Patrick's word that he is actually keeping 
10% in bitcoin?

I'm so glad you decided to share the existence of that foam torch with the bitcoin community even though the Single came a bit later.  
Oh wait, no you didn't!

This has always made my brain hurt. How can a Christian be an Anarchist?
I mean, you have a fucking leader called Jesus H. Christ!

What's up with Circle?  Banks see the transactions , and are probably like,
WTH is this?  It looks shady as hell.  Let's block it, it could be online poker / online gambling.
I guess all the employees at Circle Jerks have to spend all the next month calling banks
telling them they're legit
