No. These studies showed people ADDING calories to their diet under controlled circumstances. 30k over a couple months in one study, yet not one single pound of fat was gained by any of the participants. In other words, their total caloric intake was maintained and they added nuts to it, didn't gain any weight. You can call names and be rude all you like, as a matter of fact I invite you to do it some more! Everyone who reads your comments will quickly see why you need to resort to such low-brow conversation, BECAUSE YOU'RE WRONG AND YOU KNOW IT.

No, that's not what the studies say. They specifically did NOT take out other foods, they ADDED nuts to their daily diet. They didn't *replace* their daily diet with nuts. Only someone who is wrong and knows they are would put those words in the author's mouth. You literally just made that second sentence up out of thin air to avoid admitting your error.

Just wanted to reply to show you that I was indeed correct:






Did you read that? *30k* (!!) calories added without a SINGLE POUND GAINED. You, and your clinical dietician mother, could learn a thing or two. The fact is the idea that 'calories in - calories out = weight gain/loss' is FALSE as well as overly simplistic. There are several foods that act like nuts do, increasing metabolism, and in general do not increase fat storage. Processed, toxic foods do not behave this way. You and most of the 'mgtows' on this board would be well-served to drop your infantile egotism and desire to be 'right', because not only does it cloud your judgment and make you look like an asshole, but it allows you to stew in GROSSLY INACCURATE beliefs.

What?? Can you answer the question in the OP, please? Why should companies that only voted to implement segwit do so when the 2x blocksize increase that was the reason for the compromise didn't happen?
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:52:22


I was watching both subs and the entire cryptosphere for the entire time. The reason that Segwit2x didn't happen was because of the severe astrotufring and twitter campaigns, brigading etc. that took place from the core side. You guys even had hats made up! To pretend like the backers just gave up for no reason is extremely disingenuous and lets me know that further discussion with you is ill-advised.


Yes. How do you determine consensus? 1 cpu 1 vote. Not 1 twitter poll, 1 vote. Not 1 NO2x hat 1 vote. 90% of the mining pools signalled for Segwit2x. Which means that 90% of the hashpower signaled for it. Only your campaign against it, which is well-documented prevented an otherwise landmark deal from going through.


No. You have higher fees because the core devs refused to release a client with a higher blocksize, thus artificially creating a 'fee market' 100+ years before it was destined to happen. BCH works today with 8MB blocks. Dash has the same rough blocksize. You are not being honest.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:56:56


Which is fine, but the agreement was segwit + 2mb blocksize, so essentially 3.7 mb increase, your side of the deal reneged on the 2mb part. So the question still stands, why should the other side, miners, companies and the like, implement your side of the deal? I mean, that's not compromise.


Even if 100% of everyone were using it, forgetting the fact that not 100% of everyone AGREED TO IT, fees would still be high and the backlog would still be there.


Lightning network has been promised for 4 years now. People want to be able to transact in bitcoin NOW. THere are coins were 'patience' is not necessary. Can you answer the question in the OP?
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:53:15


So you don't mind coinbase calling bitcoin cash, bitcoin cash and adding it as a trading pair then, right?
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:25:12
I understand that, but that should apply to core developers as well right? Bitcoin is a protocol, not a pet project. So why is there all this animosity towards those who were willing to compromise? I mean, the devs literally shat in the face of their business partners by doing this. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:23:51
All you have to do is shapeshift them to PIVX, set the accumulator to whatever percentage you want mixed, then send zPIV to your wallet and voila, clean coins.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:54:02


I'm sorry, but where in the bitcoin whitepaper do 'devs and general users' get a say? The bitcoin I signed up for clearly states '1 CPU 1 vote' in order to solve protocol disputes. And for good reason, relying on metrics such as 'devs' and 'general users' is vulnerable to sybil attacks. For example, there are about 115,000 users that you are NOT COUNTING in your 'devs and general users' who clearly wanted a blocksize upgrade. There is no way to accurately determine what the 'general users' want or even are. Twitter polls, reddit forums etc. are all easily gameable metrics, only hash power cannot be faked.

Not true. If one set of 2000 calories a day is stored as fat while the other is rapidly burned as energy then your weight will indeed differ based on what you eat. Since low quality food is usually composed of things the body cannot use for energy, these things are stored in your fat cells. However, some foods are rapidly consumed as energy and not stored at all.
@_date: 2016-07-14 22:30:17
This is just not true. This is a gross oversimplification of the bodies complex weight maintenance mechanism. 
@_date: 2016-07-15 02:58:19
Say what you will, but aside from being physically ripped myself, I have counseled several people who have successfully lost weight. The expert 'nutritionists' have not produced good results despite decades of similar oversimplifications as you present here. I only go with what works.
@_date: 2016-07-14 22:29:18
There is no need to be rude, if you are correct then you should be able to argue so. If not then you should be able to admit so as well. It is a fact that the body stores certain food as energy (fat) while it uses others. This is governed by activity and food content. For example, if you're sitting around your body burns fat to keep the lights on. But if you're doing any sort of activity that requires more effort, your body uses carbohydrates. Thus, just eating 2000 kcal doesn't mean you will store 2000 kcal, it depends on your bodies needs at the time. If you only eat a fat diet then your body will need to perform a complex conversion process to generate the simple sugars it needs for immediate energy. This is why they tell you to eat a diet balanced in carbs, fat and protein because 2000 calories is NOT just 2000 calories.
Furthermore, certain 'food' is useless nutritionally and your body just stores it in your fat. This is called junk food.

It was nice chatting with you. May you find peace.

Yes it does both directly and indirectly. Consider this, if you eat 2000 cal worth of grass, how much weight will you put on? Not 2000 cal because your body cannot digest grass. This alone disproves the notion of 'cal in, cal out'. One counterexample is always enough to disprove an axiom, but I shall go another step further.
Your body cannot digest fiber. If you consume 2000 cal of fiber, you will not gain 2000 cal of weight, because your body cannot digest/metabolize fiber. Whatever is not digested by your gut bacteria (which is different from your digestion), is expelled.


No, if you're sitting on your butt all day your body utilizes fat for energy. The second you begin moving, any movement, your body switches to using sugars from carbohydrates. This is why sitting all day is a dangerous activity, because among other things, it allows your blood sugar to rise due to inactivity (i.e. non-metabolization) leading to things like diabetes.


No. If you only eat fat your body cannot build muscle from protein synthesis. Also if you only eat fat, your body must undergo a process that generates sugar from fats, this process is called gluconeogenesis and is much less efficient than generation of energy from carbohydrate sugars. It is suspected that this is why atkins diet practitioners lose so much weight, because the conversion of fat to usable energy requires more energy than the regular pathway. But this fact alone means that 2000 cals of fat is not 2000 cal of weight because your body, without carbs, will utilize that fat as energy to generate energy proving that the calories in, calories out idea is oversimplified bs.


Yes it is. If it is indigestible like fiber then your body cannot metabolize it period. However, some things that your body cannot metabolize in food are stored in your body fat.
