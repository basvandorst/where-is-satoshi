You can exchange anything for anything if you find someone else who's willing

How'd this one work out for ya bud
@_date: 2018-01-03 07:27:23
That's the one I ended up going with, pretty fast and convenient!

I just have a slight qualm about the customer quote. "To anyone who will listen" sounds a bit crazy, as if some people wouldn't listen. Maybe just cut the quote off at "anyone"?
@_date: 2014-05-25 21:44:04
Oh well. Was good as an experiment anyways.

I don't like the imagery of the physical coin in the background. We're trying to move cryptocurrency away from that image.

He spent 100K on the other one. This one is at least 500K!

Heard him talk at a conference in Toronto. Got $35CAD in Bitcoin from him. Great guy. Enjoy the book!

I only noticed it was gone for one bundle. Anyways, it didn't matter to me anymore. I spent 35 dollars of Bitcoin on bundles, and now I'm all out.

What's to stop me from, say, getting some credit and then just disappearing? Bitcoin is anonymous.
@_date: 2015-08-27 14:29:47
100% agree with you on this. That design just screams "SCAM! STAY AWAY!".
@_date: 2015-07-18 22:49:52
What happened with robocoin?

Would credit bureaus in countries that don't recognize Bitcoin as a currency recognize your input? The thing with Bitcoin is, you cannot prove that someone owns a certain address.
@_date: 2015-08-28 11:54:41
Holy fuck. How do you even get to a total of one hundred thousand for such a shitty design?
@_date: 2015-08-28 16:58:14
"We" as in the Bitcoin community.

Slap a few unobtrusive ad banners on the bottom of the page and you've got yourself a revenue stream.
@_date: 2015-07-18 22:54:20
Oh, I see.
@_date: 2015-07-01 17:06:30
Oh, OK, thanks.
@_date: 2015-09-07 13:33:23
Is it OK if I just PM you my name?
@_date: 2015-09-20 23:26:28
That is a tiny-ass plane.
@_date: 2015-09-05 14:58:13
Address reuse?
@_date: 2015-09-07 13:34:22
So basically it's recommended to only use each address once per transaction/source?

Do we have to give our real names, or can you just use our usernames?
@_date: 2015-10-31 01:12:02
Thanks op, I'll be sure to check that out!

Preferably something physical. I've seen cool things posted on here before, but I can't find them.
