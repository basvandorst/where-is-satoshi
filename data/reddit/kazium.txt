Eh...Kind of. 
The difference here is that, using your analogy, these companies have constructed a lovely bunker for you to hide in, and would directly profit from the destruction of the environment, instead of only just 'saving money' by not implementing environment friendly measures.
The main point is that not implementing these measures is clearly malicious. I don't believe big companies that produce waste are doing so with the sole objective of destroying the environment, it just happens as a side effect and they don't give a shit.

If more people consumed these educational resources and actually learned about what the hell they are investing in, then we'd see a lot less market panic when a single country announces some regulation.

What is fake about the stats? Mempool drops significantly during the time a single service goes offline. That single service just happens to be one that is refusing to implement block-space saving measures (batching, segwit). This is just further proof that refusal to implement available features is the cause of high network fees and slow tx times.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:59:47
What, BTC is a ponzi scheme? :/
@_date: 2018-01-12 09:51:11
The fees and tx time would be lower with 100% segwit adopton, this is an irrefutable fact. 
It absolutely needs to be implemented, any refusal to do so, especially from a large provider like coinbase, is a deliberate sabotage of the network.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:40:37


Yes, it is exchangable against goods, there are retailers (both on and offline) which accept bitcoin, this is an irrefutable fact. Just because not every store accepts it does not mean it is not a currency.
Are you expecting mass global adoption, otherwise it's a disgusting failure ponzi scheme? 
Bitcoin is a first mover in fully decentralized technology. 
It is not perfect, nor will it ever be.
It is, however, a fantastic attempt at creating an alternative system to your much loved dollar, which is currently being propped up by trillions upon trillions of debt, seemingly infinite amounts of dollar printing, and it's not even got the gold reserve as backing anymore. 
Why don't we label the dollar as a bubble ponzi scheme? 


well thanks for once again reinforcing my original point.

I think the point is that these transactions are sent without using the available features to make them more efficient.
I don't think it's unreasonable to call a service which is refusing to properly batch transactions and send them using segwit, spam. Because it's doing exactly that, spamming the network with unnecessary and easily preventable extra information.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:20:13
wow so all of that was just discovered by the market yesterday? fascinating theory.
the 'value' you're talking about is it's trading value vs those other currencies. 
The dollar is also traded against other currencies, all currencies are traded against other currencies, your point is a moot one.
value of currencies fluxates depending on news, yes cryptocurrencies are more vulnerable to news as the market cap is a tiny speck in comparison to traditional markets, meaning the effect of movements are highly concentrated.
The value of the pound dropped significantly when the brexit vote passed, does this means the pound sterling has no stability? no, it just means the market thought that the news now meant it was worth less compared to other currencies.
how can an open source, decentralized currency that is freely tradeable for all known currencies and exchangeable for purchase of goods, be a ponzi scheme? please just take a moment to sit and think about those definitions. 
You need to understand that there are many people involved in cryptocurrency for it's technical and utility value. The market price is often driven by irrational investment but this does not make the product, or the development of the product, a scam. If the developers were provided external funding they wouldn't even need to make their tokens publicly tradable. This fact is further reinforced by the fact that many private blockchain products exist, they are not tradeable and are funded by private companies.
This is kind of the point I was trying to make in my original post. If more people were educated on what the product actually is (other than """free money!!""") then we would see less irrational market movements. You calling it out as a ponzi scam further reinforces my point.
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:01:51
Or we could just implement all the features. There is no reason to ignore one feature because it doesn't magically solve all our problems at once.
The feature is implemented and it works, there is NO reason to not use it. Only explanation is incompetence or malice.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:32:34




quite a difference, especially in an extremely fast moving technical product environment.
Every time you reply, you reinforce my first point.
Education will solve a lot of conflict in this space.

Every time you say 'Satoshi's vision' it further reinforces you as a BCH troll with an agenda.
Satoshi's vision wasn't to simply inflate block sizes to temporarily attempt to resolve the problem of network congestion. 
Inflating the block size also inflates the blockchain size which makes it more and more difficult for someone other than corporations to host nodes, due to hardware cost requirements. This means that BCH becomes further centralized and under the control of a company, as opposed to under the control of the users.
The 'solution' offered by BCH is nothing more than 'kicking the can down the road'. 
The real solution is proper development to find a technical solution to the issue, something which can't happen swiftly if people are too busy destroying the protocol from the inside out with greed.

Oh, bitcoin.com? That's a company owned by RogerVer, he is the creator of bitcoin cash, a totally different coin which directly competes with the original bitcoin, in fact it aims to destroy it completely.
Now, why would a bitcoin wallet created by a competitor of bitcoin deliberately enforce extortionate fees? Geez I can't work that one out...
Looks like someone didn't do ANY research and literally just typed in 'bitcoin.com'. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:29:00
Let me know what your initial thoughts are, I'm especially interested in how you think you're going to sue an open-source protocol. 
In theory, I could turn up to court to defend it. LOL.
Stay mad friend.

For every person betting on short, there has to be someone betting long. It’s a contract between two parties. Traders aren’t just going to go all short because they literally can’t, and the people going long won’t just piss money away.
They’re also not actually buying bitcoin so the mere act of them betting on the price, off-chain, does nothing to the price.
If you are insinuating that wall st wants to manipulate the prices, what is ‘wall st’ as a collective group going to choose to do? Long? Short? Why would this be any different to the whale manipulation we already experience?
All that is happening is investors with a buttload of money are looking to enter into a deflationary currency. THIS IS FUCKING GOOD.
Pls explain in a manner other than ‘loooooooll wall streeettttt’ how the launching of futures is bad for bitcoin as a currency, and us as holders.

The only fairyland is believing that institutional investors can short without another institutional investor betting on a long. 
Like i said, it’s a 1:1, thats how futures work.
Not to mention its illegal to go short and then take action to tank the price. These futures aren’t unregulated crypto wild west, they are established and regulated. People play by the rules or they lose it all instantly.

They are ASIC miners, look like antminers, so yes.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:18:53
Except that's just not true, otherwise Binance themselves wouldn't be able to trade would they?
Can you go away, research what actually HAS happened, then try this post again?
Namely, the company is registered in Hong Kong, not mainland China.
@_date: 2018-06-07 11:03:35
They don't have an infinite amount of space, electricity and staff to manage the ASICs. It's a constant balancing act between the cost of those factors and the efficiency of the equipment.  
They will run the ASICs into the ground, to the point where they are almost dying, then sell them when they are replaced by more efficient models. This allows them to maintain an optimal mining model.   
It's a business.

Coinbase is not a wallet, it seems that you’re not too sure what you’re talking about.
There is nothing wrong with breadwallet, OP appears to have encountered a rare glitch/bug.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:01:55
Please show me this 'coinbase wallet'.
Coinbase is an exchange. They offer hosted wallets within their exchange, but these are not 'wallets' in the true sense of the word. A wallet is not your own unless you own the private keys, coinbase do not give you access to the private keys, they are simply giving you permission to use their wallet to hold your coins. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 05:44:52
It doesn't exist. You can't trade out of all major exchanges directly from a private wallet. Exchanges have their own 'hosted' wallets which you must use.
Edit: neither of the replies below make any sense, nor are they relevant , so I'm not bothering to reply.

Aunty mavis and dave the builder aren't investing in crypto. We are early adopters, I've seen estimations that only 0.5% of the worlds population are currently invested. 
At the moment, it's simple technical tasks for a tech focused user base. I really don't see the purpose of the OPs post, it's answer already exists in the story of Mt Gox, go have a read.
If you don't like the current solution, then sell your crypto and come back in 5 years when it's got training wheels and a one touch iphone app to hold your hand.

Have you never seen this meme before? 
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:41:03
Yes but WHY would it do that? Remember you can't effectively TA crypto, it follows news and announcements. I can't see any advancements that BCH will make that'll rally it's price. It's hardly got a use case and is just being dumped by people who never really wanted it in the first place.
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:00:43
Cryptos aren't designed to be stored on exchanges. That's why private keys exist. A software wallet is not hard to figure out, the private key is just like a 'secret' passphrase used to get access to fiat bank accounts.
If it's on an exchange then its not your coin, they own the private keys. You are trusting the exchange to give you them back when you ask for it.
Don't hyperbole me. It is crypto 101, learn how to store your coin safely.

The 3-5 day delay is how long it takes your banks to transfer the funds, I don't believe it's a coinbase problem. 
Once it hits coinbase they will process your fiat money into crypto within the hour.
@_date: 2017-10-09 13:16:50
By not storing my shit on an exchange long term I avoid these problems.

If the private keys are lost, the coins are gone forever. 
The private keys are the wallet.
Its a good thing for everyone else though, it reduces supply which increases the value of everyone elses supply.

Mass adoption via companies which make mavis able to safely manage a cryptographic token in a wallet with a private/public key ect  are NOT compatible with decentralization and the aim of the projects. You cannot cater to these people at this time.

SEPA is an international bank transfer within europe. You initiate it from your bank account, I assume you have access to online banking? You can send the payment from there, using the details coinbase gave you. Make sure to include the reference, and make it like €7

Think hard and ask yourself 'what could possibly happen that will cause a significant increase in BCH price?'
When I ask myself that, I turn up nothing, so I would have sold yesterday.
