I just checked, and I have 150Gigs free memory so that can't be the issue. Also, I have a 2,8GhZ i7 macbook Pro 8gb ram so that can't be the issue either. 
I am a "noob" when it comes to stuff like that, so could you please tell me how I reindex? Is it a command for terminal?

I just learned that I've misunderstood the whole concept of crypto currencies - thank you for that.
I do have a few more questions for you though! 


I clicked the link, but I can't see anywhere how many bitcoins are available for purchase


So the more transaction activity there is, the higher the price per Bitcoin? I know that DogeCoin has got more transaction activity that all other cryptocurrencies combined, but the price still fell 8% in the last couple of days?

I appreciate your reply, but why should the price of BTC increase to 1k USD after a buy order of 8,5M USD? The way I see BTC is pretty similar to Stocks. If someone decides to buy BTC for 8,5M they'll post an open order on one of the BTC exchanges for lets say the current price of 600USD per BTC. Why should the price of BTC change then? Also BTC's market cap i 7,8 Billion Dollars, so a buy order of 8,5 M USD would only have a minor effect on the market cap, and hence the price for one BTC. 
If everyone wants to buy BTC, and no one wants to sell them, that's where I see an increase in price for 1 BTC.

Don't you think that if the popularity of Bitcoins increased by 10000% over the next couple of years, the liquidity would increase alot as well? I don't see why people holding massive amounts of Bitcoins wouldn't want to sell off at some point in the next 10-15 years.

I just checked, and yes it does

ok so I just "finished" syncing to 90% and once again I got the "Failed to write undo data" message. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 11:38:10
Thank you for your reply!


So if Paypal, Ebay, Amazon and Google at some point starts to accept Bitcoins, this would increase the transaction activities hundreds of times and increase the BTC price tremendously as well.
Also, what is your estimate for the price of 1 Bitcoin in 2020? I'd love to hear that.

How do I reindex? Also, would it be wise if I downloaded another wallet client and just transferred the wallet.dat file to that folder? Is it safe to post part of the debug file here on reddit? 
@_date: 2014-05-22 12:05:23
Thank you very much for the help, So far I have been trying to do exactly what you told me, but the Bitcoin-QT has still been syncing for soon 4 hours. Is that normal? I thought that the 17GIG bootstrap file would make the sync pretty much instant, or am I still doing something wrong? Please check this picture 


















@_date: 2014-06-02 16:19:07
The thing is, I never got to synchronize my Bitcoin-QT to 100% so it still says 0,00BTC in my wallet, so I cannot transfer them. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 16:13:16
Thank you for your reply. You are not the first one to recommend Electrum. Could you please tell me how I can transfer the Wallet.dat file from Bitcoin-QT to electrum on a mac?
@_date: 2014-05-21 12:31:13




How do I do that? So far I have just launched the program and been waiting for it to sync automatically
@_date: 2014-06-02 16:20:14
thank you, now Bitcoin-QT lauched by itself! 
I will get back to you whenever it has synced for a while to give you an update on the status
@_date: 2014-05-30 14:02:36
I just got this popup after Bitcoin-QT shut down 
Its weird, because I get this message every 30-40th minute, but then I reopen Bitcoin-QT, let it sync a bit and get the same message again, but still my Sync Percentage is climbing. Right now I'm at 92 Percent
