Agree. I didn't get into Bitcoin as an investment.  It's simple.  It's a decentralized currency.  Yes you can store value there (sort of right now) but it's meant to be a usable transfer of value between two individuals.  Period.  
All the Wall Street investor types can jump off a bridge with their non-production, piggy back, skim-off-the-top, get-by-with-whatever-you-can ignoble way of life.  
Bitcoin is a NOBLE idea.  It's fundamentally fair. Controlled by no one except EVERYONE.  I don't care how much it's worth.  I don't even know why it's connected to the USD.  Everyone here gets excited about WHOEVER accepting Bitcoin when everyone knows that they IMMEDIATELY change it back to fiat.  So Bitcoin is only an envelope that the fiat comes in.  Big frikkin deal.  
Here's the true value of Bitcoin:  If you and I both agree on a value of a good or service... that's how much bitcoin it's worth.  
Smaug says, "Well, actually the value of Bitcoin will go up if everyone holds their coins because this article says... bs, bs."  
Look, quit looking at Bitcoin as an investment and look at it as a tool for society.  It's value is the value of the goods and services that you and your friend agree upon.

Got a laugh out of that!

Thanks for the feedback.  It's active but you won't see it until payment time.  I'll try to put a bitcoin logo on the homepage.  Enjoy Taiwan.  Here in the American MidWest we're struggling with a blizzard.  The kids have been off school all week and are driving us crazy.

Can't compare.  The reason is that our kind of whole leaf tea can be used throughout the day as it's resilient and keeps putting out all the time.  Bagged tea is a one time deal.  Quality tea is actually cheaper than bagged tea as the best leaves are picked by an real human. 2 oz. will last a long time and it's totally worth it.  Start with the formosa assam or the Farmer changs green oolong as an initiate into the world of real tea.

Earl Grey does indeed Rock the Casba.  Thank you for the suggestion.  Earl Grey is Bergamot (A Sicilian orange) peel and Assam Tea.  We carry Assam already, so... I'll look into soucing good Bergamot peels to make a serious Earl Grey.
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:10:47
We don't convert to fiat.  You have my word on that!  We sell hand-picked teas from small family farms in Taiwan.  Good clean tea.  Not cheap crap from China made with slave labor.     
@_date: 2014-12-05 18:16:05
Oh, snap.  Just noticed that the "detail" tab is not showing on any of my tea pages at the moment,  WTH?...  thanks for the heads up!
@_date: 2014-07-29 19:04:18
We have a flat charge of $10 if you spend over $15.  I've checked... it's not bad! :)
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:45:42
Re: Article.  Exactly!  Exchanges are only for the unevolved.  Bitcoin should be independent of the US dollar and should be its OWN economy.  That's the point of Bitcoin, not investment!  The value of it is exactly this:  WHATEVER SOMEONE WANTS TO GIVE ME FOR IT and however much I want to give for a product or service.  It's negotiable.  I don't know much about Dogecoin and now I intend to find out.  I own a bitcoin accepting business but might look into Dogecoin.  
@_date: 2014-04-17 13:19:37
Perfect timing!  Can't wait to see it. 
@_date: 2014-11-04 22:26:58
Thanks for asking.  I have never converted to fiat.  I use bitcoin when I can to pay suppliers.  We even have some farmers that accept bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-03-21 16:42:38
[Beautiful Taiwan Tea Co. here] Don't have any reviews on this one yet, but trust me, you won't be disappointed with this tea!  It's high quality and is a great daily drinker bought directly from a 3rd gen farmer who is a family friend.  Free shipping is for USA, $5 for Canada, $10 international.  Thanks. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 18:40:18
Sounds like he's been creamed.
@_date: 2014-09-20 13:37:55
hm.  thanks for the heads up.  We recently went with a different theme on Shopify.  
@_date: 2014-09-19 22:18:04
Can ship tomorrow morning :)
@_date: 2014-02-18 15:18:27
Yes, support us merchants who are not converting to fiat.  Like us!   
@_date: 2014-03-22 01:56:12
Cool.  Thanks for letting me know.  Sam told me about it.  We've only done two bitcoin transactions at the shop but a lot more online.  Glad you enjoyed it and hope to meet you in the future.  
@_date: 2014-11-04 22:12:07
Haha, Three observations:  
Discount good for all teas, not just this one.
$15 orders getting free shipping is unheard of in this industry.  It's usually way more.   
Our tea rocks.  
@_date: 2014-09-26 03:19:22
sure thing. Smaug.
@_date: 2014-08-22 01:56:04
@_date: 2014-11-05 04:06:03
Hope your grocer is forward thinking.  No acting here though... ???
@_date: 2014-03-21 20:55:05
Cool thanks.  Unfortunately we stick with tea leaves, but that's kind of our niche :)
@_date: 2014-08-21 18:07:29
Yes, it gives you the option to pay in bitcoin as you check out.  Thanks for the feedback.  I'll work on it :()
@_date: 2014-03-21 20:36:09
Thanks r/bitcoin!  We've made a lot of Bitcoin sales today!  We'll send it out tomorrow.  Get ready for some real "quality of life" tea coming your way!
@_date: 2014-01-24 16:17:34
I would be impressed if they held on to the bitcoins.  Taking payment in bitcoin and immediately changing into fiat equals just another form of payment in fiat.  The point of bitcoins is to build a new de-centralized economy.  I accept bitcoin at  and I hold onto it waiting for the time when I can buy my tea from the farmers in bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-11-05 00:13:41
Haha, sorry about that.  I'll make it a point to carry it soon.  Thanks for the suggestion (demand!)
@_date: 2014-11-05 03:03:54
All of your community are us. lol. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:35:48
Hey you! Why not at least drink some decent tea while you're at your terminal? Try this one.  
or if you like Black Teas:
We just got it from the farm so it's FRESH.  Buy it with bitcoin:) 
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:01:51
I wish I was in Vienna having a beer and paying with bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-11-29 14:52:14
Ok.  We'll make sure you get it.  Thanks for your order!
@_date: 2014-01-09 18:40:33
Hi Guys, I'm one of the old-school guys that really believes in the vision of Bitcoin, a decentralized peer-to-peer currency.  Our teashop in Zionsville, IN has been accepting bitcoin for a while but now you can order ONLINE at   Our teas are getting great reviews and are a definite plus for your health and your daily life.  Cheers to r/bitcoin! 
@_date: 2014-09-20 03:11:24
haha. Is your friend into teas?  This tea is very special.  It is grown at very high elevations and has many unique qualities.  If you need any help, just pm me or take a look at our site for brewing suggestions.  Cheers!
@_date: 2014-03-22 01:59:31
yes there is fake tea.  Just like there are real men like George Washington and Teddy Roosevelt and fake men like the guy who got knocked out in 1  second in that MMA fight.  
@_date: 2014-04-15 22:33:02
I don't put much stalk into these comments either.
@_date: 2014-11-05 18:50:42
Yes.  World-wide shipping is expensive for us.  BUT, we offer a flat rate of only $5 shipping to Canada and only $10 to Europe and the rest of the world.  It doesn't cover it all but helps. 
@_date: 2014-09-20 01:10:03
Cheers.  We try to make the best quality tea available to all.  And this is the best quality tea becuase we source it ourselves directly from small family farms. face to face.  Quality assurance.
@_date: 2014-01-10 03:19:35
Haaaah. I didn't see that but I like it. ;)
@_date: 2014-08-21 16:13:39
Ok fine! But that farmer takes his bitcoin, gets online and buys something from overstock.com.  An employee of said company who accepts part of his pay in bitcoin comes to my site and says, "Damn, that looks like good tea" and buys it using bitcoin.  Ha!  
@_date: 2014-01-08 21:15:47
As for me and Woody Guthrie, "I don't want your greenback dollar".  Let Wall Street use their campaign contributing political power to regulate Bitcoin in some way?  No thanks. The whole point of Bitcoin is to cut out the 1% and their minions who help them make their money. "Freedom for my peer-to-peer people".  Seriously. If you're into bitcoin for profits only, please go back to your masters world.  
@_date: 2014-03-24 16:05:16
Question for you:  We charge $10 for shipping to Europe from the United States.  Does that sound reasonable to you?
@_date: 2014-11-05 02:59:07
I know, right? All we have to do is make a mini economy only in bitcoin, from producer to supplier to retailer to consumer.  As long as we all agree on what it is worth... THAT'S what it's worth.  That's what we are trying to do with this business.  
@_date: 2014-12-05 21:32:02
Hmm... All tea would be helpful but probably ripe Puer tea is best for that.   
@_date: 2014-08-21 18:32:31
Good one!
@_date: 2014-11-04 18:56:22
You got it!  Thanks for supporting the new economy based on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-15 13:28:29
Wow, that IS stupid.  Thanks for your feedback.  Have a GREAT day from Indiana, USA!
@_date: 2014-08-22 01:10:06
Come grab some whole-leaf, small family farm tea 30 minutes south in Zionsville, IN while your at it -- 5 minutes off of I-65.  Let me know you're coming though :)   
@_date: 2014-05-23 20:51:22
I ABSOLUTELY SECOND THAT!
@_date: 2014-08-21 18:03:35
Sorry, the bitcoin logo is on the homepage. It's a rocket!  
@_date: 2014-08-22 01:01:43
Sorry, not right now.  We do offer free shipping if you spend just $15 bucks.  That's a good deal right there :)
@_date: 2014-11-05 04:20:18
Ahh. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 17:27:40
Sure.  So we specialize in "Face to Farmer (TM)" sourcing in Taiwan with our exclusive farmers.  Taiwan is one of the best tea growing regions in the world.  
But now, we are partnering with others who do what we do in other parts of the world.  So we have a "Guest Tea" initiative that includes Face to Farmer sourced teas from Yunnan, Hanzhou, Nepal, Assam, Sumatra, etc... with an ever expanding list of top-quality teas from small family farms.  It's a fun project and I get to drink the best teas of the world on a daily basis. lol.  
@_date: 2014-06-10 15:41:15
Likely likey.
@_date: 2014-03-24 16:02:01
To those who ordered tea on Friday:  We were'nt able to get i all done on Saturday so we shipped it all out Today, Monday, 3/24 from Indiana.  Thank you r/Bitcoin.  Please let me know your experience with our tea!
@_date: 2014-09-20 13:39:47
Thanks!  Please let me know how you like them, or if you have any questions about them.
@_date: 2014-08-21 19:23:14
Haha.  This is part of our "Guest Brew" program where we offer family farm tea from other top-tier growing regions all over the world :)
@_date: 2014-03-22 13:54:30
yes, we ship to Europe but must charge $10 shipping.  It is charged automatically at checkout.  thanks!  Payable in bitcoin of course.
@_date: 2014-12-05 18:11:59
Yes, that tea is from Pinling, Taiwan.  All tea locations are up. Thanks. 
@_date: 2014-06-24 20:53:30
There are ~~a lot~~ some of us who don't care one "bit".   
@_date: 2014-10-09 15:03:39
I'm impressed with the honesty here.  Go Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-11-05 00:12:42
Yes, we accept Bitcoin.  In fact, I think we were among the first to actually accept it as currency.  
@_date: 2014-03-21 17:23:42
Thanks!  This is actually one of my favorite teas.
@_date: 2014-08-22 00:56:05
Cool!  Thanks!
@_date: 2014-03-22 02:03:38
Right.  Strain the leaves, leave them in the cup and you're golden. 
@_date: 2014-09-26 03:19:06
sure thing. Smaug. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 17:45:21
Thanks.  I'm sure you'll enjoy it!  Just keep the water temp below boiling and give it enough time to steep.  It'll be smooth no matter how to brew it but if you nail it, you'll get a very nice aroma too.
@_date: 2014-10-09 18:38:06
Only if you let it. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 03:05:18
The cool thing about our company is that we do "FF" sourcing.  Here's what that means: 
@_date: 2014-12-05 18:00:15
Yes, we disclose where each tea comes from and what season it was grown.  I don't blame you for not buying from China.  Our teas are sourced from very clean areas.  Here's a picture of our farm that grows our "Farmer Changs Green Oolong and our Honey Black tea.  
He showed me his organic certificate for his tea but it's certified in Taiwan and not USDA because he doesn't sell to the USA.  OUr other teas are from similar areas and our farmers swear to me that they don't use chemical fertilizers or pesticides but we have nothing on paper. 
@_date: 2014-09-26 03:19:37
sure thing. Smaug.
@_date: 2016-06-20 02:40:55
Thanks.  I did upgrade but the problem is that now I have two multi-bit programs instead of one.  I wish it just upgraded with my present wallets.  Now I'm not really not sure what to do after two days of looking stuff up.  
@_date: 2016-06-20 20:15:12
Thanks! I'll give it a shot.  
@_date: 2015-02-18 02:53:14
THANK YOU! We are a company that has accepted bitcoin since Nov. 2013 so we're a pretty early adopter.  This Kickstarter is to help us grow our line up of teas but if you want, feel free to visit our website and you can buy anything there in bitcoin ;)  
Edit: Although I must say that we are out of some teas right now because the spring harvest won't come until April.  But buying through the Kickstarter will insure that you get them absolutely fresh from the farm.  
@_date: 2015-02-18 02:51:23
Thanks.  That's right.  About 15% of our business is in Bitcoin right now.  We actually are buying some teas in bitcoin and selling them in bitcoin right now.  Haha.  Don't find that very often if ever. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 03:22:34
They are beautiful.  Like Chinese painting but I don't have a tea room in Taiwan.  Our store is in Zionsville, IN but I lived in Taiwan several years and that's how this all started.  
French press is better than tea ball, or just plop some in a cup and drink it grampa style. 
We have a cheat sheet here: 
@_date: 2013-11-12 02:20:06
Please do, we'd love to have you.  This is more a labor of love for me and not just a business.
@_date: 2013-11-12 04:46:26
Tea in Indiana, LOL.  No, I use personal connections to buy hand made teas from small family farms in Taiwan.  I speak Chinese and enjoy their humanity... and their tea. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 02:24:36
Please do!
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:26:36
Good one.  I expected this to happen as China is a strong blip on my radar.  I found out about Bitcoins when it was $300.  The Chinese look at it like a stock.  They were looking to get rich quick.  So I decided to let it rise and when the big government says NO and the crash comes... buy like crazy :)  
@_date: 2013-11-12 04:55:54
@_date: 2013-11-12 02:24:12
No, not me.  But We'd love to have you come by. Our teas are unlike any teas available anywhere because I personally curate them from small family farms through personal connections.  Farmer market tea is ALWAYS factory tea from China and you just don't know what's in it unfortunately.
@_date: 2013-11-12 04:01:25
Thanks.  I just added my shop to both.  What a great community!  I just started researching Bitcoin two days ago and MAN is this fun!
@_date: 2013-11-12 04:05:36
Good tea is the BEST. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:52:57
Thanks for the tip.  I'm not a twitter (er?) but I'll make an account and put it up.  I'm really excited!  Not really for personal gain but I'm blown away but the prospect of a totally new peer to peer system.
@_date: 2013-11-12 02:18:40
Thanks so much!  I hadn't seen that until today when you pointed it out.  Wow, this is moving fast!
@_date: 2013-11-12 02:21:03
No, should I be??
