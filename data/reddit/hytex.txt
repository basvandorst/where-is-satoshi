Why the heck would you keep the only copy of your wallet on a portable machine which is prone to theft and/or intrusion as is, without guarding it like you do your physical wallet?

1) You don't. You make an educated guess and hope you're right.
2) You don't. You make an educated guess and hope you're right. That's why its an investment and not a figurative safe deposit box.

Which then makes it a trust issue. Also, that still is not as anonymous as Bitcoin, since I'm still giving an alias and a credit card number which can be traced back to me if found in its raw form. All you get with BTC is a private key which is encrypted then stores, if I'm not mistaken. I don't have perfect understanding of the protocol so maybe I'm being a fool, but I definitely think BTC is more private than credit cards on an absolute level.

Make a digital trading card game which uses Bitcoin as the currency for buying individual cards, packs, etc through micro-transactions. Credit cards (and the information you're required to input) are too slow for prompting the kinds of "in the moment" impulse purchases that stores like exploiting users for, and obviously fiat doesn't work. (I do wonder though whether PayPal is viable for this, despite hearing a lot of bad things about them).

Address? Ship it to a PO Box and then go pick it up, or, if it's a digital commodity, don't provide one at all. Provides a level of data abstraction in case you're really paranoid about that particular seller getting/using your information.

Tell me, which former superpower threatened to occupy either of those states? They're not very comparable in that regard. This is more akin to WWII, where Hitler marched into Poland and everyone let him

Bitcoin first started being worth under 1 USD per BTC. It is now ~650 USD per BTC. It's value will continue to increase with the number of adopters, the image associated with it, and a myriad of other factors.

No. The blockchain is public and contains all BTC transactions. If anything it's simpler to track than cash.

This seems pretty good for bitcoin overall. Not that it is starving for attention, but giving potential (legitimate) entrepreneurs seeds for ideas might urge a few to jump into the BTC ecosystem. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:26:16
Which would happen faster if companies were bought out sooner, since they could enact price fixing and false competition faster.

I respectfully disagree. As a long-time follower of the SC2 scene during WoL and HotS as well as the LoL scene, the macro dynamic of SC2's competitive multiplayer gameplay is unable to generate team dynamics akin to that of League of Legends, DotA2, and physical team sports, all of which completely dominate viewership. Team sports simply eclipse individually focused ones in terms of the stories they are able to tell with the people that participate, which is a large factor in what keeps people invested once the mechanics of the game become familiar. For this reason, the best bang for the buck lies in DotA2, while the biggest possible impact comes from LoL.

By that point, it's likely the entire Bitcoin network would be irreversibly dying, so it's a smart move by N&amp;B. Their investment into BTC actually helps the price go up, which means when consumers give them fiat and they buy BTC with it, it'll drive up the price even more, giving them more purchasing power.

I like being relatively anonymous while making a payment, do you? Especially for things like sex toys, drugs, medical procedures, and other embarrassing purchases.
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:00:41
Could be lack of the following:
* fiat
* payment methods
* knowledge on trustworthy exchanges / the protocol overall

You supply them with any address. Doesn't have to be yours, although I see the point your question tries to make. Grab a PO box, have them send it there, and grab it when it arrives. Still better than a credit card, which requires lots of legitimate details such as your name, which is pretty important as a lot of other details can be doxxed with that alone.

Can confirm belief, am working to buy in in gradual amounts right now. I need my proxy savings account to establish, and then I will drop small sums into coinbase and/or bitstamp most likely. Can't wait to shop with ฿! :)

Upvoted. Not sure why more people don't realize this. Keep it all cold (paper, etc) and bring it back as you need it.

The more realistic (and just as good) mark to aim for is "unprofitable". If they lose money stealing your money, they won't steal your money.

You're 100% correct: one of the biggest roads that needs to be paved for widespread crypto adoption is ease of use. If doge is truly easier than BTC to use, then it will reign supreme ten times out of ten. See: Apple vs Microsoft.

That's why you test with very limited amounts of money, BTC, and people, and usually you'd test internally for a while before even starting an "alpha". You have to be prepared to lose before you start winning; that's how it is with any momentous change.

Two problems with that assumption:
1) States have already begun recognizing BTC as a legitimate financial commodity / currency, can't remember which off the top of  my head.
2) Countries with relatively large GDP, like China, have already put the boot down on Bitcoin and it hasn't impacted the global growth very much. 
The only time governmental resistance will be a problem is when EVERY government rallies against it; and if that's the case, there's likely a fundamental problem with the protocol, which means it's not fit to survive anyway.

That's why you don't keep 100% of your trade volume on their wallet and instead take it from cold  when you need to trade.

The differences between Amazon and Coinkite are as follows:
1) Amazon has billions of dollars with which they can absorb Kindle losses, Coinkite does not.
2) Unless I'm lacking knowledge, Kindle e-book profits likely make up the losses for the kindle, much like PS4 games make up for the money lost selling a PS4. The coinkite product line has no such array of unique, modular products to sell that only work with their card and reader offerings at such a reliable, fervent pace. 
Note that I do agree with you that merchants need to first adopt Bitcoin, but there are problems which may prevent Coinkite from realistically implementing what you just said. Selectively giving away units and helping stable businesses in more tech-savvy areas might be more successful, since word of mouth is powerful advertising when harnessed.
