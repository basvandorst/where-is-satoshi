It’s more what happens when we run out of people buying as speculation?
It’s hard to trade back if no one is buying and few businesses trade goods/services for btc. Even with the crazy fees.

That doesn’t give it value beyond an ideological desire for it to have value sadly.

I invest because it’s an easy speculative investment and will be for the near future. My concern is trying to answer legit questions from other investors. Playing volatility is fun and a great way to make a quick buck. Will be even easier with the futures market coming.
However, I want to have a real long term solid explanation that doesn’t rely on ideology for why it will stick around. This is not a confrontational argument at all.

My “this is not antagonist argument” is in response to the dismissive “don’t invest” comment. I appreciate your longer response.

I don’t think there will be an easy direction back to usable currency once this craze ends. Or at very least it will crash.
There’s only so many goldbugs.

Well right now I’m pretty sure the price is as high as it is due to an over abundance of speculation. I agree btc will eventually have a baseline of value if the algorithm isn’t flawed. However I just want to be able to say to an ordinary investor why the price will remain up.

I understand the store of value idea but that requires there to always be enough people with liquid currencies you can move to who can accept the store in exchange.
With gold you can always give someone gold (in theory) bitcoin is more complicated. And there is at least one global currency tied to gold so gold has an inherent value because you can jump to that.
If a nation started a btc store and bought and sold btc with their currency to keep the market liquid I could see the value store argument remaining solid permanently. But that hasn’t happened yet.

That’s really not an argument. I could easily give an explanation on why real estate, usd, gold, or oil will remain up for the foreseeable future.
However with btc the issue of it not being really effective for transactional use is a big problem because it means you always have to leave the currency to use it as, well, a currency.

I'm actually curious about this. Because if that's true, then a criminal syndicate could short the entire system in a ForEx that allows short bets, and then take the whole thing down.
at $50 a shot, you could make billions.
