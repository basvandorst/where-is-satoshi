Has anyone checked what happened to SaluS? x5 increase from yesterday, even with all other crypto falling. Crazyness is the name for this market.

1) Sell your BTCs; 
2) Donate a large amount of money; 
3) Watch it dip; 
4) Steal your money back; 
5) Buy BTC back on dip; 
6) Watch it rides up, profit.

1 - Never invest more than you can afford to lose; 
2 - HODL;
3 - Buy the dips; 
4 - Diversify your crypto investments. 
And you WILL be fine.

Good timing as well. How much have you paid?

Bitcoin traders are shitting themselves actually.

Steady rise? It's been halted around 14k usd for 2 days now.

Nothing, we are mostly likely on the "Return to normal" phase. 
I just hope that BTC's "Return to the mean" phase will be a "Skyrocket again" :)

Welcome on board! Good timing as well, we are still on Christmas sale :)

Sorry to say that, but Bitcoin is not the best crypto choice for your purposes. Its currently very slow and has very expensive fees. It's digital gold at the moment.

BTC dropped from 19.5K to 10K in minutes on Dec 22th  just to recover to 17K a few days later. 
Its just a correction after a 100% increase on 2 weeks..

Crash? Where?
