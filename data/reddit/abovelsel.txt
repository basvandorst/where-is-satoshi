Lambo here trying to trick me to waste my bitcoin on a Lambo while my wife is trying to make me waste it on the kids. What should I do?
@_date: 2018-05-03 20:53:23
I'm ready for it, finally got the 10 bitcoins I wanted to get, let's send this baby through the roof!
@_date: 2018-05-04 16:00:54
I've been buying for a while, had 9 bitcoins before it broke 2k, garbing that last bitcoin has been really financially painful lol

Seriously though, I remember last years dip causing such a ruckus scaring alot of my friends and family to pull out. When they came back in they had to come back for half of the crypto they had before they fear sold. They started with an initial investment of around 5k each, and now they have less than me even though I initially only tossed in 700. Starting to feel like I'll hodl forever seeing this happen twice now, even if bitcoin dips from 120k to 40k I don't see myself selling, hell even if it dips from 1 million to 300k I don't think I'd sell.

Dude let's do it! We can help crypto by revolutionizing the strip club world! We can make this a proof of concept model and then license the tech and business model we create for this idea to other strip clubs so they can crypto integrate too! I also wan't to start a service that helps businesses integrate bitcoin into their business model. I think it's a huge open space for the market, like the early days for google when they'd go to businesses and teach them how to list themselves and advertise online. A lot of money to be made on this early internet 3.0 days

You mean this 20k dollar deal I thought I was getting was a ruze?
@_date: 2018-05-07 16:11:34
Dude! We're going to be rich! If bitcoin keeps growing at this rate we'll be able to open it in 3 to 5 years! 
@_date: 2018-05-04 15:53:36
You telling me I should get another 11 bitcoins? Fuck it! Bring it down low boy! Daddies got some pockets to pour!

I'll do my best, but last time I tried to give Charity bitcoin she said they only accept cash at her strip club. It gave me an idea though of opening a crypto stripclub, dancers with a wallets posted on the walls and physical bitcoin mock ups that rain from the roof when bitcoin is donated. Who want's to invest with me? We can hire Charity too!!

That's what I said about 10 thousand before I hopped in, also what my brother said about 1 thousand before he hopped in and made me laugh at the 10 thousand prediction. Never say never.

This charges up your jump like Donkey Kong swinging his arm.

Low enough for me to grab 21 bitcoins without going into financial ruin.
@_date: 2018-06-20 19:30:31
Because then I won't have 21 coins, only 15. And that's not the OG bitcoin club.

Because the years of experience in the financial institute has created a plan of repetition, The wales of the world search for good companies/investments, get in early enough to be able to shoot it to the sky, then tank it down to an attractive level for other whales to be convinced to enter, then rinse watch and repeat. If any market is on a forever climb then the big guys never hop in in a significant way believing they missed their opportunity. It's the only way you get the Warren Buffets of the world to come in, because guys like him will never buy at the top of the market, because they never believe it will go further than what it is, but they will believe that it will go back to where it was at least. It's a lot easier to make people on their level believe a market will return to previous highs than new highs is the gist of the story, and when they buy with that belief, they buy a hell of a lot more than they would if they were betting on a new high.
If the regular person new this they would be rife and upset at the market manipulation, but as long as the same people manipulating it own the people in charge, nothing will ever change. The good news is it's going back up and beyond, the bad news is it's going to be a hell of a roller-coaster on the way up. So sit back and scream if you must, but don't hope off while the roller-coaster is in a drop, that's how you get dropped to a financial loss/death.

I'm waiting for that 4k and 3k dip to make my big moves. You wan't 5 million dollars bitcoin? Well bring it down low enough and it's yours!
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:26:21
Got to dip to 3k first before our clients are willing to put there money in. Proper estimate is anywhere from 2 to 5 months for us to see it get that low.
@_date: 2018-06-18 16:12:13
So mention bitcoin in every comment I make to bring the price down low enough for me? Roger that! Johnson!

Whens the circle Jerk? I'll offer my future mansion as the location.

It's the same percentage pattern from the 2013 1,200$ drop to 200$. 85% drop; they can safely bleed the market down here and use the pattern to attract the rest. After it get's this low we will advise/trigger our clients that it is time to hop in causing the next slow climb back to the top.  
@_date: 2018-06-29 16:51:55
That's fine, 4k is the number I need to make my clients happy. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 18:45:55
No one wan't to buy now knowing it will go down to 4k, buying there will guarantee much higher profits that buying now and worrying later when it dips to 4k. Plus the clients we have are the same clients we have been advising in Wallstreet for years, one of them has the means to put enough in for the 20k bitcoins. Last year we had only 5 of them in the game testing the waters, now we have those same 5 and another 50 clients slowly dipping their toes in the water, all of them waiting for the 4k bitcoin day to make their big moves. For now they're just buying enough to cause a small swell, sell most of it to trigger sell orders and further drop the market while still collecting small amounts to them during every sell off. They're the ones bringing it down, so they can get in much bigger when they get it down to their magic number. And even if they kill it, they're still making insane returns just doing this alone.
