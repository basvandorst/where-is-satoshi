Bakkt is a physical bitcoin futures contracts, that result in delivery of physical bitcoin, unlike CBOE or other futures. No way that will be negative or have no affect on price 
@_date: 2018-09-26 17:11:06
Then sell and GTFO
@_date: 2018-09-24 14:32:45
Still not close to 6200, You may as well buy back in now before youre forced out of the game or have to buy back in at a loss
@_date: 2018-09-25 15:45:09
Every poster here has said the next week is critical every single day for the last nine months
@_date: 2018-09-09 14:07:34
Made a $200 purchase last week. Fee was 10 cents, this was the default fee from BRD wallet. 1st confirmation was in about 15 minutes
@_date: 2018-09-16 15:08:45
My take is up to 6800 then back to 6000 one last time, after that around 6k for a month before the next bull run starts. FWIW TA is bullshit if you look on trading view youll see charts predicting everything from revisiting 3-5k to going straight to the moon
@_date: 2018-09-21 23:34:02
I hope it goes down once more too. I am planning on buying some more if it drops to 6,000 one more time, but its getting very close to the end of the descending wedge and this pattern may not continue much longer. FWIW I was contemplating selling some now too, just feel like its a huge risk right now
@_date: 2018-09-09 23:45:04
It wasn’t too long ago you were posting we’d be at 2000 in August, what happened to those Elliot waves?
@_date: 2018-09-27 13:18:25
6500 is the new floor
@_date: 2018-09-21 23:19:51
What price will you FOMO back in ?  its very dangerous to expect to buy back  in lower this close to the bottom
@_date: 2018-09-18 18:12:32
No, you never want to buy when prices are close to the low for the year, wait until its at least 15k.
@_date: 2018-09-24 15:25:04
Your post said you sold at 6500... Ouch
@_date: 2018-09-26 20:51:13

Dont worry about this guy, judging from his post history he is likely a no-coiner troll

Youre predictions have consistently been wrong. Why do you continue to post this.?
@_date: 2018-08-12 12:58:28
Ive used bitcoin for transaction for severeal years and ive never experienced any of the things you are talking about in fact mylast couple of transaction confirmed in less than an hour and fees were less that .50% that is half of one percent. OP I believe you are what is known as a concern troll.

@_date: 2018-08-18 12:08:40
There is plenty evidence to believe it will break out, anyone who believes otherwise hasn’t done any research or is just scared. Which are you?
@_date: 2018-08-12 13:34:00
Im sorry but with the fees you say you paid, you either dont know how to use bitcoin or you are lying. I go with lying.
@_date: 2018-08-12 18:27:45
TLDR;  OP is lying about transaction times and fees in an attempt to concern troll
@_date: 2018-05-24 17:49:15

Under a buck? Do you have any idea what transaction fees are even going for now. I just sent 150USD for .01. Yes one cent
@_date: 2018-10-20 13:57:05
If you haven noticed bitcoin has already had several “bubbles” and each time it has recovered and went on to new all time highs

Not true..its also good for buying drugs on the dark net
@_date: 2018-06-12 14:58:50
Congrats man! I started buying last August, at 1.68 now, should have 2 by this August
@_date: 2019-02-05 16:25:48
Nah Trolls like you will always be here
@_date: 2019-02-11 00:02:48
 “It’s a bit of a moonshot bet and it’s been organized in a manner that is very different than the way ICE typically does businesses. Bakkt has its own offices, its own management team, etc. They’re well along in building out an infrastructure that I think you’ll see launch later this year,” said Sprecher. 
sounds positive to me!
@_date: 2019-02-24 19:41:39
Just bought some bitcoin from Coinbase. Apparently now you have to wait 15 days to move it off coinbase even to coinbase pro. Ive always been able to move immediately in the past. Is this a new policy of theirs if soi ts finally time to dump coinbase.
@_date: 2019-02-05 18:43:24
Sure sign of a bear market ending is when you start seeing a drop in the quality of troll posts. We’re  almost there guys!
@_date: 2018-11-06 02:40:44
With the increase in the network, and by network I mean people who buy and use bitcoin, from 2014 until now. I think it’s reasonable to expect the crashes to become less severe and the recoveries shorter.
The last chrash was 90%, this one has been 70%. The last recovery took two years this one should be shorter.
@_date: 2018-11-11 19:32:35

It has to be some kind of error but Coinbase pro was showing a 24hr volume of 51 bitcoins at about 7:30 this morning, its back up to around 3,000 now

Cryptos not for you, you should just sell and get out now.

Sorry to offend you B Cash, you are one of my favorite posters here. I was only making a little fun of Neveragain, who awhile back told us price would never increase until google searches increased, and then repeated price follows interest in a multitude of posts

Wrong. Microtransactions  will be very big, and credit cards cannot do that.
@_date: 2018-11-05 19:20:32
What rally are you seeing? No rallies around here
@_date: 2018-11-07 17:13:44
I agree with you that the bottom is in, the last bull run was far from the biggest mania in history, and this crash has been 70% from ATH,
 the last crash was 90% from the previous ATH. The bear market from that crash lasted two years, that was also due to Mt Gox which handled the majority of all bitcoin sales at that time. No reason at all to think this bear market will last as long as that one.
@_date: 2019-01-21 14:54:47
thats amazing, I finally got down to 6300
@_date: 2019-01-27 15:38:52

Why is it you only post this when the price dips. If the price had gone up 100$ instead of down 100$ would you have made this post? I think not. Also you have made this post ad nauseum for weeks and weeks now. Everyone here has seen it.

If you want to buy for zero fees and zero premium transfer funds to coinbase pro and then buy with a limit order. Only downside is you have to wait several days for the transfer to clear ACH

I've used Cash App to but and it is easy to use. The no fee thing is a bit misleading because they are selling higher than the spot price. I'v tried to find out which exchange they base their price on and the percentage over they charge but havent had any luck.
@_date: 2019-05-27 15:55:34
I started buying as an investment in Aug. 17 at around 4,000. I didn't want to sell until I had held for at least a year to avoid short term capital gains tax (US). In retrospect I should have sold, I could have brought back lower, increased my stack, saved a lot of pain and still paid the tax

Completely misleading article I would expect better from Bloomberg. for those who didnt read the article they say trading volume is down, then cite the USD value of trades from this time last year compared to USD value now. Then they say pros are ditching bitcoin because number of shorts are declining, of course no one is going to open a short now.

What kind of fucking shitcoin is this? GTFO
@_date: 2018-12-17 01:31:54
I think bitcoin is more appealing to retailers than the consumer, cheaper transaction fees and not being on the hook for fraudulent transactions. If they are worried about price volatility they can convert to USD immediately and still have cheaper fees than Visa/master card
