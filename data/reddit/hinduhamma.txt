It won't recover until it has a reason for big money investors to STAY LONG TERM.
The world isn't even remotely close to using Bitcoin as actual currency lmao. What the fuck good is it? Enough with the "ohhh it's decentralized! No government controls it!"
Nobody gives a fuck. There's like 15 people on this planet that have actually went shopping and made purchases with Bitcoin lmao.
The price has been manipulated from day fucking one. Anyone with a large wallet can come in, sweep up hundreds of millions worth of Bitcoin and raise the price. Then sell off once they get their desired profit.
The only ones hodling are fucking morons. The rich are rich for a reason - smart hands &gt; strong hands. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:53:19
Wat the fuck are they supposed to think??
"Well this investment failed I'm down almost 50 percent. I guess I'll just think negatively and think the price will continue to tank forever. "
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:36:01
Memory pool has been full from day fucking 1 lmao. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:51:15
Lmfao transition to crypto currency?
You and I will be long fucking dead before crypto is the main go to currency in the world.
It's still transitioning to credit cards and you think they are ready for a step beyond that?
Not any time soon they aren't. No one is buying Bitcoin to purchase shit. They are buying Bitcoin to ride the hype then cash out with big profits. 
Cash has use in the present and in the future. Cryptos don't have a god damn thing (for now) . 
Also, a war will break out because of human level AIs don't have rights? You must be a big fan of chappie? News flash  , we aren't even remotely close to having human level AIs in the field.
Good job on listing shit that's half a century out at best.
This sub , I swear.

Lol you are not beating wall street. Get that out of your mind right now
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:38:52
This is the worst fucking advice.
You don't buy more. This is a product that literally has no value . No one is using it as currency. The price has artificially been rising because big money investors can sweep up and buy up millions of dollars worth of btc , then sell at will.
There is no logical reason for the big fish to hodl. They aren't fucking stupid. They are rich. They aren't investing in Bitcoin lmao. They are trading it. 
You need big money investors holding for non volatile price, for sustainable price action and growth. That's when you know theres something safe to believe and invest in - when the big fish are holding it for long term
This is the exact opposite. It's filled with traders. None of this big fish bought Bitcoin to use it as a fucking currency or bet against the dollar lmao. They bought it because it's easy to manipulate (drive up the price). Once they are happy with a certain profit, you hit the sell button.
Only a fucking idiot leaves 200-1000%+ profit gains on the table. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:35:27
Good for you. There's far more people who are not long on it thou.
At the end of the day, this is more of a gamble then it is an investment. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:00:20
and proceeded to get bailed out and continue winning....
they aren't gonna fail for a long term. they aren't gonna just die off. not in our life time.
this is not the 1%ers...this is the .001%ers we are talking about. they run this shit. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:40:54
Lol. Discourage? Sorry for saying things you don't wanna hear.
I should just post "hodl" instead right? 
People need to understand what the risks are. That's all I'm trying to point out. Wanna keep hodling, go for it. Just know that you should be perfectly ok with losing the entire investment you made when it comes to cryptos. 
People shouldn't be complaining and ask wtf is going on. This is the very nature of crpytos. You should know what you sign up for before buying. 
It's a speculatative gamble. Period. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:07:51
No but a group of redditors sure as fuck isn't. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:14:53
Good. I hope it goes up, for the mental sanctity of others.
I don't think the folks who bought at 19k are as glad as you seem to be lol.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:56:51
"no no no! If it's green, it's not manipulation!! It's supposed to be green, and reaching new highs all the time! It's only manipulation when it's red! No one should be selling Bitcoin so the only way it's red is through manipulation!"
There are actual idiots that believe that. Not just in Bitcoin but various other stocks, equities, etc
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:21:39
Then fucking sell.
Stop listening to the god damn 17 yr old morons on here spamming "hodl"
Take the profits and move to a real investment.
Bitcoin is not a god damn currency like so many are out here pretending it is. No one is buying SHIT with Bitcoin.
It's being purely bought for speculation and swing trading. Only a true idiot is hodling this forever. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:38:10
Hmm so it's purely a bullshit investment then?
The fuck is Bitcoin for if nobody is god damn using it? Just hold it forever and hope the big players never sell? What happens when they dump it all for gains? 
Since btc investors clearly have zero use for the actual Bitcoins lol, it's purely being held to see some gains. What is the purpose of Bitcoin again? Decentralized what? 
@_date: 2018-08-14 11:39:02
If you believe he is from the future then you better pray Bitcoin hits whatever profit target you have in mind
You gonna need the money to pay for those medical bills.
Lay off the pipe thou, for real.
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:02:25
They resort to that because their country/economy is fundamentally in shambles.....
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:21:19
So are you. There's a lot of things that were rotten from the core with this country...
Leadership/political being the key driver..
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:24:14
What fucking fundamentals? It's purely being used (ok 99%) as a get rich quick scheme.
Most of the world hardly even uses credit card lmao. And you think crypto will be the currency of the near future? Not even in our children's life time will it be used widely. It's gonna be centuries .. and that's a big IF. 
Fundamentals lmao. Everyone I know just wants to BTFD and cash the fuck out with a quick 50-100% gain or whatever...
Only fools are hodling. If this bitch ran to 10k next week those "hodlers" would be the first to cash the hell out. 
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:14:14
Google is your friend.
@_date: 2018-06-24 13:02:29
Based on the fact it's a grand pump and dump scheme.
Only reason it ever jumped to 19k was big money players (whales)...and those folks with that kind of money is smart...they unloaded the fuck out of their holdings for a reason.
Because the point of this game is to make profit.
Once you have it, dump.
Hodl for what? Some baseless notion that the world is gonna use it as currency lmao? The world has barely adapted to credit cards. 
No Bitcoin is absolutely useless for the foreseeable future. It's purely a get quick rich scheme. Every single fucking person on here saying just "hodl!! It's the future.? Decentralized!!" Is a joke - they be dumping their coins immediately once they are in the green.
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:40:12
Lol if you actually believe anyone is buying or trading this shit for "fundmentals". "Currency of the future, block chain! Hodl!!"
It's just a big fucking pump and dump.
99% of the ppl chasing this bullshit are in it for a get rich quick scheme and hope to flip a few 100%. That's it. There's nothing more to it.
No one's fucking buying it to use it as a currency outside the 13 edgelord millennials in Seattle or some shit. 
Only reason anyone bought this while it's been range bound in 6k is hopes it goes back to $10k + and they will hit the sell button immediately...too bad the whales already did their big moves. Good luck finding more of them 
@_date: 2018-11-25 02:30:45
K well continue speculating on that belief that is not going to be corruptable at all and can't be used for unethical reasons. 
No one buying/selling crpytos right now give a shit about that crap anyways. All they care about is profits. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:53:08
You absolutely delusional if you think the avg joe on the internet, who can barely understand email, will be able to understand how the fuck this works or what the fuck, Bitcoin even is.
This a completely advanced game in an unadvanced world of tech literate users. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:35:43
The avg joe is completely clueless on what the front end is for this....hell the average person in this world doesn't even know what the fuck GUI stands for lol.
This is not even remotely close to being some world wide utilized tool by the average person like email is or how credit cards are used.
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:40:54
Heh. Bitcoin is a trade. Not an investment. 
Majority of the big money "investors" aren't fucking holding this bullshit forever. Like they would shares of apple or Amazon. 
They are "trading" evident by the fact a lot of whales cashed the fuck out after x amount of profit. 
Only a delusional person is actually hodling this bullshit. Decentralized! Block chain! No govt control! 
All that is meaningless. Did I make money no? Nope. Then gtfo and move on to something else. Not blindly hodl and hope for some more whales to play this again.. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:00:45
I don't need to fucking own Bitcoin to see what kind of uses it has and what people are "hodling" for. 
You are delusional if you think investors are just buying Bitcoin for fun and holding forever no matter what happens. They are buying it to make money
That's the point of this game. To make a profit. That why people mine it. To trade it for actual money. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:04:15
Mass adaption isn't happening in our life time. The world barely even uses credit cards.
Contrary to popular belief, a lot of people in this world are not in some advanced status of life. To be able to afford BTC, understanding the fundmentals, it's not some easy concept. Understanding how to keep it safe and store it properly. Etc etc. 
It always been, and will continue to be, a pump and dump, get rich quick scheme. 
Not some massive widely accepted currency lol 
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:48:26
You think people are mining gold if it wasn't worth real fucking money?
What do you think is happening here? Think miners are doing this for some high moral belief in their time/energy is for great purpose?
Fuck no. They are doing it to make REAL money. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:45:10
The only moron is the one treating BTC / crypto in general as anything more then a pump n dump. 
Majority of the crypto "investors" are not in for some bullshit fucking keyword or it's massive potential in 50 years as a currency. 
They are in it because they see it as a lotto ticket/get rich quick scheme.
Anyone calling Bitcoin some fundamentally sound , un corruptible , unbeatable, mass adoption world wide currency , is completely and utterly delusional and purely speculating.
This is a trade. Not an investment. You don't know what the future holds for this ticking time bomb. Stop acting like it has guaranteed potential in the future.
All that matters is the present. And in the present, the price action tells all. This has purely been a pump and dump scheme by whales for over a year now. Whales aren't playing this game to hodl forever. 
They are playing to make profits and gtfo. As should anyone else right now. The only ones claiming to "don't worry, tis but a scratch, we will make ATHs again, etc etc" are wishful thinkers and dreamers.
You don't trade on dreams and blind hope.. Trade what's in front of you. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 21:25:29
Lmao get to 15k first. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:51:27
Fuck if I know. Anything is possible. But I do know if it does, it will 100% be dumped again. And harder. 
The only reason it ever pumped this high is literally because of whales. They can come back in and run it back lol. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:58:07
They at church . Praying. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:18:45
That's fine. Continue to believe that. I hope you have conviction of your investment and see it throughout.
I'm just pointing out there is a rather LARGE group of people who just see this as strict "get rich quick scheme". That's why you had that unrealistic pump to 20k and now a dump all the way to 5k
Price action speaks for it self. This was a massive trading train that took it up, then sold off and got off the station.
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:45:28
Your mistake was treating this is an investment. 
It was a trade. Point blank, period. Shit doesn't just go straight up at a 90 degree angle. It was a bullshit pump and dump trade by big money players and you didn't exit when the signs were flashing.
All there is to it. Treat it as a trade. Not an investment. The point of this game is to make profit and gtfo. Only a delusional fanatic believes this trash has some relevant fucking future in our life time.
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:21:37
Lol if you actually think Bitcoin will be some safe haven, 110% uncorruptible entity and can never be influenced by any government. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:29:53
No I'm pretty sure your neighbors kid is actually smart and is going places, and thus in an above avg neighborhood.
The avg neighborhood is not filled with kids that know how to code...it's filled with kids that just get by with the best they can get from their parents..play some ball, be lucky enough to get video games or even a computer in the first place. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:35:16
You are welcome. Much better then the "hodl!! Reversal soon!" Posts right? 
Good luck in your "investment"
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:11:29
What did you expect? It's a god damn bubble lol.
No one is buying fucking Bitcoin as an investment..or to use it as currency or whatever lol.
It's being strictly manipulated and ran up/down by big money players...tis a traders dream and an investors nightmare...if you made money congrats...but if you are thinking of jumping in now or when it was 15k or whatever..step the fuck away...there's no logical reason to fucking buy and hold bitcoin....it's a day trading penny stock but it just has higher numbers
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:08:30
I don't think you realize how little majority of the Bitcoin traders care about that.
Don't confuse trading with investing. You hodlers don't realize decentralized, limited quanitity , block chain, etc are just keywords. They mean nothing to the traders. That's what moves this "currency"
The traders. Not the buy and hodl forever group. Traders only care about price action. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:57:59
Point was there's far few people actually using Bitcoin. Most are just holding it for a moonshot return investment. 
That what people see Bitcoin as....a lotto ticket.

you can do that without spending real money on a virtual fucking coin.

Hodl is the term used in crypto communities..... Go tell them how dyslexic they are
@_date: 2018-04-07 12:38:17


There's hardly any big money player that gives a flying fuck about Bitcoin. They are in it to make money. 
Most ppl in general are trading Bitcoin to make actual money. Because that's all it is for now. A get rich quick scheme.
You think they give a shit about hodling ? Using it as currency lol? About decentralized? None of those things matter. It's a basic pump and dump
Get in low, ride it to +50% or whatever profit range you had in mind and leave a winner.
That's what happened on that bullshit manipulated ride up to 19k. Big money pushed it up and sold the fuck out. It would have a sustained move up if they actually believed in "hodling"
Only fools are hodling. The minute you are in a decent profit range, cash the fuck out. 
Don't care about no damn future use as a currency, as a decentralized tool, etc etc. Ppl just wanna make money. Could care less about the morals of this asset lol. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:24:34
Lol what bargain? It's a biblical level pump and dump scheme. 
You are out your mind if you seriously believe Bitcoin has any relevant future right now....it's a massive manipulation tool for the rich millionaires that understand this game...
Hardly anyone is using this crap as currency.  No one gives a shit about decentralized crap. You are holding a ticking time bomb.
Rich players drove this up to 19k...guess who drove it down to 6k? Those same rich players. 
Good luck convincing them to hodl lol. They understand what this is. A get rich quick scheme. 
Anyone of you hodling Bitcoin for moral reasons is delusional. Get your profits and cash the fuck out. That's exactly what the millionaires did.
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:59:23
Ya anyone with emotional talk is automatic ignore.
This is purely business. Profits and losses. I don't care about your morals or philosophy about Bitcoin and how it's gonna save the world or whatever else dumb shit people spew.
This is simply price action...the trend has been set since the manipulated run up to 19k...and it's clearly been a down channel but proven support and bounces have established in the 5-6k range...so play the tight range and exit on the bounce when it happens
If it breaks under 5k and goes toward 4, good night. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 16:23:25
It's too volatile to predict. Who knows if there will be as many big money pumpers as last time on the ride to 19k...maybe it run out of gas at 12k this time and they leave.
It's definitely a traders market right now. Even in stock. Volatile markets across the board. Those caught simply trying to time a swing trade can get burned easily so be careful.
Don't hold and be greedy with profits. If this dumpsters to 4-5k and you wanna swing it. Go.for it. Just don't say I'm gonna wait till 19k! I'd take profits and run even at 10k. You'll neveer be sad with profits
Those that said BTFD at 12k are getting royally fucked. The first drop is never the floor lol. There's always plenty of room to fall. Just be patient for an entry and don't be greedy on your exit
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:17:49
You folks need to understand the big money game. 
These players with millions of dollars can manipulate the fuck out of this crap. 
You are absolutely delusional if you believe the main big money investors are "hodling". 
They are driving it up and cashing the fuck out.
Their is only one goal here - get rich quick.
Spamming "hodl, future of currency! Decentralized!!!" Is absolutely meaningless to these millionaires playing this game.

Lmfao not a single motherfucker is looking at RSI and saying "hmm this means a bounce is coming, time to buy , it's basically free money. The rsi indicicator is fail proof I will make money buying every time it's oversold and I'll sell when it's overbought, it's so easy, why am I not a millionaire using this tool yet?"
