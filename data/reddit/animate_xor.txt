I've been subscribed for a while but haven't checked in like a week and I'm confused.

Because of this capitalism is fundamentally unstable, and like all prior relationships of production will ultimately fail.

The problem with relying on markets for everything is that they are entirely incapable of delivering critical use values in a rational fashion. Take Homelessness in the united states for example. There exist 5 vacant homes for every homeless person but somehow solving homelessness remains a mystery to most liberals.
And I don't believe bitcoin could ever solve, or even ease class relations in capitalism. It may serve only to deepen the rift between "owners" and "workers"

Man I really wanna post this to because god damn that is some I D E O L O G Y 
You have no idea do you, under capitalism the worker's sweat is expropriated from him by the capitalist and then sold back to him for a profit. A capitalist's wealth is "earned" for him by his employees and his position of owning the means of production.




Fixed this for you, seriously, you just reiterated a common marxist criticism of capitalism but then substituted some words and made it a completely nonsense argument trying to fit it to your shitty ideology.
Socialism on the other hand, is broadly the idea that the working class institute a state in their class interest, literally a dictatorship of the proletariat, as opposed to our current dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Most socialist countries current and former were radically democratic in ways that put liberal "democracy" to shame.

Seize the means of production! Eat the rich!

100% Bitcoin Adoption would do nothing to prevent the vast accumulation of capital by currently existing capitalists, if anything it would be another bludgeon used to beat the working class into submission. Capitalism is not your friend.

I did leave room for ancoms in my wording and respect their position, but where I personally sit though is that any worker's revolution will need to be defended against counter-revolution and the tendrils of the global bourgeoisie until socialism takes a firm hold on the majority of the planet's population. Any real defense of the revolution would need to be coordinated and will end up resembling a state, but one comprised of the proletariat in their class interest.

Man you like to imagine yourself on top in this dream scenario. In reality "stateless" capitalism is an impossibility and any attempt to create it would be a return to feudal class relations with the capitalist and their private militias that would enforce their private property 'rights' serving as lords and knights respectively.
Also your conception of socialism is completely fucked and it seems like you're just using it as a catch all term for "Bourgeois government doing stuff to help the poor sometimes"

So tell me, how will bitcoin destroy consumerism and produce a sustainable economy within the capitalist mode of production.

The state exists in its current form to reproduce capitalism, and to enforce the social conditions for reproducing capitalism. The internal contradictions of capitalism cause the boom-bust cycle you describe. Eventually those internal contradictions (chiefly the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and proletariat, capitalist and laborer) will cause the system to collapse in a wave of revolutionary class struggle.

If we simply do away with the concept of private property and parasitic landlords all of this could be avoided and we could end a large deal of human suffering in one fell swoop.

I was pointing out that the constant crises of capitalism and its presumption of infinite growth will lead to its demise.




What the fuck are you smoking over here

Oh man this passage in hopelessly naive in its historical conception of private property. There would literally no reason for this car to not be communally owned.
