i wanted to buy bitcoins at mt gox but since i have no utility bills in my name they refused.
i guess i need to know a trustworthy place to load and unload bitcoins onto paypal or credit card?

anyone very familiar with this site?
it seems like if i stick to any pattern i lose money but if i kinda vary my pattern i can steadily climb...
do they have pattern recognition software?

Thanks everyone... so far I'm up .30 btc on just dice :)

is anyone familiar enough with just dice to know how long it will be until my deposit shows up in my account?
@_date: 2013-10-04 18:21:57

walmart employee card for paypal
used direct deposit info as my paypal bank account info.
i've had bank accounts in the past but in 2002 i closed both my bank accounts &amp; all my credit cards but 1.

whats insane?
my family has dealt with the same credit union my whole life.
every member of my extended family does there borrowing from that credit union.
i had a savings account there and a checking account elsewhere and closed both in 2002.
its way too easy for me to spend money if i dont have it in my hand so i made it easy for myself to manage my money by dealing in mostly cash.
