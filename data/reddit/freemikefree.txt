Yeah, jokes on them. Only **I** know who the *real* wallet inspector is.

yeah you're right. guess we all should have went in at $1000, right?
@_date: 2015-01-16 00:40:22
yeah, but if it's **[THIS Ashley Barr] ( this might start to make sense. This Ashley Barr worked at Mt. Gox, currently lives in Japan, and has worked/lived in Vancouver... which White Rock is pretty much a suburb of. 
He'd have 2 strikes against him in Karpeles' eyes.  He knew something about gox and silk road....

Depends what you mean by overproduced? 
If its bitcoin you're talking about - there is no over-production, it's a controlled release according to algorithm. 
If it's hashing power you're talking about - I think you're right in that they either oversupplied the market in terms of hashrate **or** they over paid for their hardware. I completely understand a company needing to re-coup their R&amp;D cost, but there were *so* many people gouging people down the lines for reselling. Most of the time (if you could get your equipment), your rig was out of date by the time you got it. Not to mention when you find out these rigs you got...some of the manufacturers/suppliers were running your equipment, and mining ACTUAL coins before you got it... and not told it was pre-used. 
I think this might be the catalyst a lot of people were looking for when they were complaining about that mining is too centralized. CEX has shut down cloud mining. CoinTerra is in default. There was a giant dip and then spike in the hashrate.
But if these companies are going tits-up - that means you're going to have liquidation sales in mining rigs... meaning the average joe can get get their chunk of hashing power and do whatever they like (ie p2pool!).  
For me, I'm long out of the serious mining game. I do some for shits and giggles with a couple handful of BlockErupter USBs to do a random altcoin when my htpc or my desktop is on. 
Not to mention - those mining contracts were complete sketch on CEX. Buy a GHS for bitcoin, and watch it drop in price by half the next week!  Interesting concept, but just doesn't work in the real world because of so many outside variables.

super serial...

He worked at Gox, lived near White Rock and is apparently still in Japan?  The plot thickens because Barr would have dirt on Gox and Silk Road.

i'm lucky that i was in on it during the 20s, and 40s.... so i'm still 'up' but i've been buying steadily even at the $1000 mark. However, I have been buying in the same dollar increments... $20here, $50 there with every paycheck. 
People are so psychologically fixated on the price though. People think it's not worth having unless they own a *whole* bitcoin. I've come across so many people... They'd have $40 to 'waste' - but saw no point in buying because 'well, i want a whole bitcoin' - but if the prices shoots up 200% over a year - they're still up 200% on that $40.

Guys, i'm serious. look at this [Ashely Barr guy](  Mark has more than one motive to kill him. He's a former Gox employee (and pretty much unknown at this time in the whole saga). 
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:25:53

So if Karpeles paid a 'hitman' to take out Ashley Barr - and Ashley Barr was the other person behind Silk Road, and was a former Gox employee... and no murder took place? Do we have any bets that Ashley Barr could have been the guy who took Mark's payment? I really think Mark would be that stupid and naive. I bet this guy, being head of 'ICT' was watching all of his communications - and Mark would be too stupid to even check the services running on his work computers, or cell phone for that matter.

our 'job' is to support and push the technology forward. our job is not to pander to special interest groups. 
the software is free, the code is widely available online, there are whitepapers galore.  if they're not interested - it's not **my** concern.
for almost 15 years i was interested in this little thing called "Linux" (you might have heard of it). I still get the odd tease like "Linux runs best in your mom's basement."  
Maybe if people didn't dismiss technology enthusiasts as male-loners doing stupid things with computers that others don't understand - women would be more receptive to it?  Now I know that solely lands on other men and women's shoulders, and not mine. 
Blame society, not bitcoin.
