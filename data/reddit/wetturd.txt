My point is, has that not been a bad strategy so far.
In terms of just supporting the technology without being wrapped up in the price is keeping a neutral position not ideal or is it that you've not invested too much thus far?

Wow, what a let down

China carried the price from $100 to $1000.
Lots of bitcoins about to enter the market along with gox coins and all the other frauds

Arrows are just there to indicate where we are now vs where the last crash bottomed out. 
While it looks like we have a bit more to go this is a three day graph meaning each bar represents three days so that bar is not yet formed but if you see where the crosshairs are @ $610, thats where we are now.

I think your title is distracting from the fact the only way their business model would work is with constant rising Bitcoin value.
Karpelles also said bad people (hackers) ruined his business so don't automatically assume this guy is telling the truth about death threats.

isn't that the only logical outcome for bitcoin given the efficiency incentives to centralize mining. 
There is likelihood those who are in bitcoin for the lack of central management will start supporting a proof of stake over a proof of work coin in the future. 
even satochi didn't like the idea of gpu mining in the beginning as it would start an arms race in coin generation

Considering there has not been a peep out of their twitter or any social media accounts in light of this I'm calling "Goxed" on this whole thing now
is their account on reddit which has also been dead for over a week now.

3Day Graph of bitstamp in log view from 
For what it's worth the last two crashes followed this exact form and when we zoom out even more you can see the earlier crashes also followed the exact same pattern where they just dip under the 3 day moving average

Funny how must the "Fud" turns out to be true in the end though.
I was called fudder for pointing out the obvious holes in the neo &amp; bee story and would have thought post Gox people would learnt to see the signs.
Everyone here is too invested to think rationally in my opinion 
@_date: 2014-09-30 13:40:25
I also had similar thoughts 
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:35:18
But that's the thing, I would be willing to bet many of the smartest tech guys out there drift to the blackhat side of things and the same people have the skills to then make bitcoin a nightmare to secure.
I don't want to sandbox every pdf attachment just to feel safe using bitcoin out of the box
Bitcoin needs an upgrade IMO
@_date: 2014-03-09 21:32:12
Can confirm, bitfinex are best IMO for day trading and you can also short the market which is only available on btc-e otherwise and I consider them a bit sketchy too.
@_date: 2014-02-27 11:45:25
Except I will then have to go out and find some other person(s) to do my dirty work and most likely I wont be able to pay for my road's, childcare, school, street cleaning, trash collection, food standard safety, environmental protection and all the other things this utility company takes care of in one easy payment taken at source. 
Just seems like it will be a lot more complaceted trying to figure out who is genuine and providing value for money in a market regulated by nobody. 
Sounds like stress to me sorting out all that so no thanks
@_date: 2014-09-30 10:16:16
can you explain why you think so?
I find it a very good hedge and my bank account says so too.

How can you say that for sure? 
My point is people said the exact same thing about DPR until it turned out he shared a used the same username/email on another site and then there was a breadcrumb link to follow (although many say NSA tech found him and police just filled in the blanks)
Good op-sec is very hard as one mistake will ruin it all.
I'm not saying Satoshi was sloppy but he was on the scnene for a long time so there was many opportunitys for him to slip up.
The fact he called it a day before bitcoin really exploded says he take his security seriously but I still think if people with the tech (nsa) want to find him it could still be possible.
Edit: One other thing, developing and deploying a piece of networked software via tor sounds like a very hard task due to the speed of the network and ip changes

With paypal I just click pay, it even remembers my address, cc info and will pay me back if the buyer scams me.
I think you are forgetting how 99% of the world thinks and operates which is, understanding and obtaining bitcoin is too confusing when I can just click the paypal "pay" button and enter a password.
not trolling it's genuinely easier than bitcoin and I don't to worry about price fluctuations.

This hacking shit needs to stop and I'm afraid to say the incentive alone is now a big problem for bitcoin because even if the hacker just gets personal data it's still not a total loss for them (identity theft etc) but finding a bitcoin wallet must be the crème de la crème for these shits.
There should be no incentive for scammers to break onto my PC even in the HOPE of finding a wallet.dat.

I tried freedom one time than I realized I don't like organizing my own water, transport etc so I just let some people take care of it for me and I pay them a percentage of my income.
I'm sure it's not the best value for money but steak is also cheaper in the butcher shop yet I still prefer a restaurant
