We need to boycot bitpay, coinbase all the institution taking altcoins as payment. Ethereum is the problem fuck vitalik and his ICO scam. all these fucking ICO shitcoin are ruining the crypto ecosystem. Billions of dollars funded/scammed in these worthless tokens made in 1min with a pretty looking website just to enrich its creators.
