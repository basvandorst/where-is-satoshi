Less than 12% year compounded... "Very, very good"?

What is my "house" in this context?

I'm pretty sure it was about the insane $30 BTC tx fees to get on the next block that pushed BTC holders to fix BTC blocksize to lower tx fees  (this did happen. Do not rewrite history).  I dont want to increase the utility of Litecoin by purchasing Litecoin to transact - I want to increase the utility of BTC, hence fork.  
So Bitcoin Cash did not overtake BTC in hash or price?  Great, not a problem.  With the fork I still have the same balance of BTC, + new BCH and I never had to leave the protocol to tx on Litecoin.

The S&amp;P returned the same exact annual return over the same period. So, no I'm not kidding. Warren's firm did not outperform the market.

I've been with BTC since 2012 - thanks for the advice though

if one side gets to call Bitcoin Cash protocol whatever it likes (BCash, BTrash, BCrash) then the other side also gets to call the Bitcoin Cash protocol whatever it likes (Bitcoin Cash in this case). Surrender to it.  
Bitcoin cannot be trademarked and even if it was, who cares?

That's your perspective, thanks for sharing.  Do you have anything to say about the technology itself?  Because I own both BTC and BCH and am rooting for both equally, so everything you listed is pure bs to me.

Don't bother - these are the children of Mammon you're trying to convince.

Is that a gift shop on the first floor?
