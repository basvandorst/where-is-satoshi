Word. 
I had a bunch of trolls claim I was a bagholder at 300$. Damn it feels good to be a gangsta.

Your logic would hold if instead of paper notes, the government issued fractional ownership of its assets.

Metherium is Ripple 2.0
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:25:30
Most implementations of LN are p2p. Which are you referring to?
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:27:28
I had a troll claim I was a bagholder around $300. Same deal "sell sell sell." 
Yeah, I'll hodl, thank you very much.
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:56:33
Shhh. We are tying to be like and pump metherium.
@_date: 2017-06-26 19:18:53
I think that is why ETH is tanking 3x faster than BTC. They see the writing on the wall...

Demand letters are cheap. Ask a fresh outta-school attorney to do it on the cheap. These lawyers are desperate.
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:31:57
Some good points but I am not with broski 100%.
It is fun watching the methereum hangover kick in.

Sad thing is the heavily advertised ones are a scam ala iDice (Russian scam) and Monaco.

I don't think links start with an *
@_date: 2017-06-22 19:29:37
It is a serious flaw. Time will tell if they can shart out a fix.
@_date: 2017-06-25 06:07:17
Good call. I thought it was already there... YIkes
@_date: 2017-06-27 22:28:11
As someone who has sued many, it sure get's their attention. Usually they make it right immediately. Try to get a lawyer to send a demand letter for 500$ instead of a percentage as a first step.
EDIT: Demand 200,000$ but the letter creation should be 500$.

I don't think he can rewrite history, just affect future transaction.
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:01:52
Ripple already did a flippening because of its massive pre-mine, similar to ETH.
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:57:45
Shhhh. Everyone look away from the elephant in the room -&gt; 72 MM token premine. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 22:34:42
This. 90% of all evidence in litigation these days is digital. Document every last thing you can.
@_date: 2017-06-26 23:38:15
The mEthereum hangover is brutal. Putting down the glass pipe is a good first step :)
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:41:13
They don't seem to mind the 72MM out of 94MM ether premine. Bitcoin premine: 0.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:47:35
Just heard a piece on NPR about Bitcoin. Barely mentioned ether. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 19:28:57
I read it on the interwebs. 100% legit.
@_date: 2017-06-13 15:48:40
@_date: 2017-06-21 18:31:21
Shhhh. It is culturally insensitive to criticize the revered mEthereum.
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:22:27
Make that 10 years and a $1,000,000.00 fine. Ouch.
@_date: 2017-06-28 19:50:15
77% of that market cap is the premine. Doesn't count. K THANX
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:18:45
I think even the Metherium folks can agree this is madness.
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:20:00
Written by nChain. Nuff said.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:39:32
Sorry. ETH has a dirty little secret:
60-72MM out of 94MM ethers have been premined. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 04:46:28

@_date: 2017-06-27 22:31:43
Usually it is an honest mistake but you gotta put a fire under their butts to take a look. Life is a competition for people's attention.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:33:38
Heard it. They barely mentioned ether. But supposedly it is taking over? Hubris.
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:05:13
That is like saying "That restaurant sucks, look at the long line!"
