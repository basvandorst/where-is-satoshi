Well thats some great numbers, but the tech is progressing, it's like if you wrote about how the internet will never be able to scale for worldwide intensive use in 1990. It seems impossible when you look at the current tech, but it's just cause were not there yet. Good quality post tho!

You actually pretty much need yo do that, the ledger gives you a seed that you must keep when creating your wallet. if you lose it, buy another one, enter the seed and it becomes an exact copy of your old ledger nano

The mempool is clearing out like crazy in the last days, the suggested low fees right now is 5sat/bite and you sent your transaction with 3sat/bite, if things keep going down, you should have your transaction mined anytime now

If you buy for 1000$ then 1000$ goes to the person you sold it for, if the price goes down and you sell at 700$, that person you bought it from still has 1000$ of your money, nobody gets a 300$ somewhere. If you sell it for 2000$, then that extra 1000$ is coming from the person buying it from you for more than what you initially paid

To understand why cryptocurrency are a good thing, you must not learn more about cryptocurrencies, you must learn more about fiat money:
Not crypto currency related, but general way forward of our future shares alot in common with cryptocurrencies, decentralisation and distributed systems are the next step in the economic revolution alot of concept you can adapt for your arguments from this :

Yes bad fees estimator are plague and sending high transaction fees that then bias their already bad fee estimator even higher, only use wallets that lets you choose sat/b, samourai wallet seems the best from those i tested on phone. And ledger nano on PC

In a world where bitcoin is a worldwide currency, its price would stabilize and only raise a couple % every year, following the economic growth. In this situation paying with bitcoin or saving them would be equivalent as right now choosing between buying something with fiat, or putting your fiat in a savings account.

Bitcoin is the longest chain (the chain with the most "work" that has been put into it) from the genesis block. That's clean and simple rule everyone agrees and that's what make Bitcoin Bitcoin, just like gold is gold, and that what make forks of bitcoin, not Bitcoin.

With the 2FA, your wallet is a 2 of 2 Multisig wallet, where you control 1 key, and blockstream's server control the 2nd. When you request the 2FA for a transaction the server sign that tx with the 2nd sig to make it valid. The multisig also has a timelock feature so that if blockstream loses the keys or whatever happens, your own key become valid to be the only signature needed. Its a pretty neat system, not centralized, just some clever smart contract for an extra layer of security, its optional also.
