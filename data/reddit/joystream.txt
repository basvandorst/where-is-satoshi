Very much so, but we have limited capacity to integrate it at the moment, so for now we use our own payment channel tech.
@_date: 2018-03-01 13:29:50
That's the idea
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:40:53
None that comes to minds. Its really just a question of getting the license, documentation and build &amp; dependency systems in a form where they are actually usable for others.
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:22:59
Still testnet, but not for long now.

A BitTorrent client which uses a modified version of the BitTorrent protocol in order to reward seeders with micropayments over payment channels. Give it a try!

Please do, let us know what you run into.

Hi, developers here.
@_date: 2017-10-26 11:39:38
Very likely, yes, we are using simple one off channels now, however that is costly. A lot of what we have already built can be adapted for use with lightning.

Haven't looked into that particular project, but we are working on a discovery and publishing layer, and it would make sense for publisher to be able to create crowd funding/assurance contract like funding options for publishing new stuff that users are interested in.
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:01:02
Had never heard of that, is it this ?
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:56:56
soon! (we have been saying that since forever, but... really, soon)
@_date: 2017-10-26 11:59:46
You are, and you are doing it only if you want to, which would typically be if the downstream bandwidth you are seeing is lower than you would like. We are particularly hoping that this improvement will make instant streaming of long tail HD media feasible.

JoyStream works with all existing torrents, there just needs to be JoyStream peers on that torrent. There is no specific tracker or website which organises torrents which have JoyStream peers, we don't really have plans to create or operate one either. If you are thinking of trackers for peer discovery, then JoyStream supports all the normal peer discovery mechanisms:
- Mainline DHT
- Peer exchange
- Trackers listed in the torrent file

What price?
@_date: 2015-09-30 03:29:17
Thank you for giving it a try, it would really help out other users if you could head over to our bug thread and describe what is happening when it fails
@_date: 2015-10-02 01:39:16
All clients will have this, that is the goal, but its still early, severe stability issues exists in plugin, and paychan implementation handles no edge cases, and bep is not even done (double spend handling, ddos counter measures, tracker price information, etc) ... it just takes *a lot* of time.

what problems are you having removing the software? Be aware, closing is done from system tray drop down menu.
@_date: 2015-10-09 22:11:32
It is only using testnet, as it states in the client. More work is required too make it handle a lot of different edge cases which can occur. Testnet is also a good testing ground since it has a lot of forks and weird behaviour.
@_date: 2015-10-26 02:08:25
Great question. If the payment is finally broadcasted and confirmed, then it spends the contract output, in which case the refund is no longer valid because it tries to spend the same output, does that make sense?
@_date: 2015-10-11 20:48:38
Ok, so you would prefer if exit button was close of application, and then perhaps "minimize" would go to tray?
@_date: 2015-10-23 12:57:14
Not stable yet, protocol and core p2p routines will almost certainly be open, if not the entire client.
@_date: 2015-10-09 17:19:47
site was just updated, lost the alpha/tesnet tagline, thanks for pointing it out.
@_date: 2015-10-11 20:47:15
Currently in boost.vc, and I can say it was the best decision I ever made for the work I am doing. If you are doing something new and unorthodox, then you need partners who are patient and willing to imagine what the future *can* be. This is very hard to find, as most people are in practice looking for proven recipes, slight variations or incremental improvements, despite what they actually claim. 
@_date: 2015-10-09 22:13:42
Totaly get that, onboarding is very poor. Try to grab the torrents in the list you find by clicking on "torrents" button. Load some testnet coins into the wallet using the faucet link in the "receive" button. Then load in the torrent and choose "buyer" plugin mode and pick the default price. Will get easier with time.
@_date: 2015-10-26 02:08:51
What needs clarifications? I can add text overlay.
@_date: 2015-10-09 17:16:01
when closing, it should minimize to system tray, where there is exit menu option.
