You could brute force it if you know *for sure* all the words in the string. You would then take all of those words, write a bash/Python/Perl script to run through each of those to create your dictionary and push them to a file. Once that is done, you will have to manually go down the list and enter them into your wallet, one by one until you get it. Problem is that would be time consuming. But with 40 Large on the line, I'd probably try.

The only way to feasibly brute force this would be if you had all the words for the pass phrase. If you are missing parts, you are probably out of luck, as there is not really a way to know which words were used and there are 100's of thousands of words, combinations of which stretch into the millions... All of which you would have to enter individually. I would be wary of programs claiming that ability to recover lost passwords... Sounds scammy.
