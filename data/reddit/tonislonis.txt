You can also see that the volume is decreasing each bullrun, so that’a a bearish divergence.

I already feel bad,  because I bought 10 l3++ 450 a piece in the beginning of summer, but now it's so much cheaper..

All I can say that volume is the most powerful indicator, because it just validates the price action.

I'm pretty hooked on gaming too, but I'm really obsessed on crypto. I read news everyday and check some great articles on reddit. I follow only one person in crypto and that is Carter Thomas(You can check him on youtube coinmasterytv or sth like that). I love my dad cuz he trusts me with insane amounts of $$, which is a lot for me. I'm always reading others stories and trying to learn from their mistakes. Hope you can understand me because english isn't definetly my main language.

Uhm, I'm 15 and I'm been in crypto since last summer. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 10:29:21
No, that's not true, but I am really believing in crypto.

I hope you learned something from this, because if you didn't then the loss was absolutely pointless.
@_date: 2018-12-29 22:26:42
Yes that's true, but I was so newbie that i didn't even know what stop is. That's one way to secure profit, but you still miss alot of profit or there's a chance it crashes down, hits your stop and then goes back up.
 The better way is to identify what stage is the bullrun in and just start taking profits as it's showing weakness or has trouble at resistance.
If you know it's gonna crash back down then why not to take profit and short it? You could earn double the amount by longing it and then shorting it back down. 
The point is that stops are really basic ways to secure profits/losses, but there are better ways to do it.
 Trust me (I know I'm fucking young, but I just love finanical markets and I want it to be my future), because I have done alot of research and also learned from my mistakes in trading/investing stock, futures, bonds, option markets.
(If you don't know the meanings of some of the words then you can google translate them)

I'm in!
@_date: 2018-12-29 20:14:55
Go for it!
I'm 16 and I invested in btc when I was 14 with much bigger size thanks to my dad. It's down alot, but I'm not worried, because I'm daytrading/trading stocks aswell. Pretty much managing my parents funds rn and I can keep 50% of the profits. 
I just really love financial markets, reading all the news, analysing and trading what market shows me to do, not what others think. That's pretty much off-topic, but I just want to give you some inspiration.
Good advice : Before you can start winning, you have to learn to lose.
Good luck and have fun!

Yeah, but you can't think "what if" or what could have been. It's hard to get the top, when it's the first time experiencing such crazy bullrun. The thing is that you MUST learn from your mistakes or what you could have done better and this is the best learning way by actually experiencing such things. 
Also I forgot to mention I just turned 16 and I invested on the half way to the ATH.
