Fortress Investment Group, which became the first Wall Street company to declare an investment in Bitcoin, is rolling its holdings into a $150m hedge fund that is targeting investments from digital currency enthusiasts.
Fortress is swapping its $13m stash of Bitcoins as part of a deal that will hand it an equity stake in Pantera Capital Management, the manager of the three-month old Pantera Bitcoin Partners fund.
Benchmark, the California-based venture capital firm whose investments include Twitter and Snapchat, and Ribbit Capital are also taking equity stakes, Pantera announced on Tuesday.
The deal, full financial details of which were not disclosed, will give the trio a minority stake in Pantera and an interest in the management and performance fees of the Bitcoin fund, which they have promised will become the vehicle for all their future digital currency investments.
Pantera, founded in 2003 by Dan Morehead, a former chief financial officer at Tiger Management, is seeking a second life as a Bitcoin pioneer, after having closed its funds to outside investors following the financial crisis. Before the crisis it managed $1bn in macro investing strategies.
Pantera Bitcoin Partners was launched in December with investors who included major fund managers at Fortress, including Michael Novogratz, its co-chief investment officer of macro funds and one of the first senior Wall Street figures to reveal he had bought Bitcoins.
A December filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission revealed an initial $147m in assets under management, and although the value of its Bitcoin holdings has fallen since then, it is believed to have attracted additional investment.
It has also revealed investments in Bitstamp, which since the decline of Mt Gox has been the leading Bitcoin exchange, and in Xapo, a Bitcoin storage company. The fund has told prospective investors that it expects to reduce its holdings of Bitcoin in favour of investments in promising start-up companies.
Fortress revealed in its annual report in February that it bought $20m of the virtual currency in the final months of last year, making it the first mainstream investment company to list Bitcoin among the assets on its balance sheet.
The virtual currency was created in 2009 by an unknown developer and has attracted increasing amounts of speculative trading this year.
“In our business, we closely follow developments in trading, exchanges and global commerce, and we see potential for the broader adoption of Bitcoin and related technologies to reshape the global payment space,” said Mr Novogratz.

They're keeping keys in space now in addition to cold storage.

Let's just be clear here: Africa is *not* a country.

Not really that crazy, actually. Zoona.co.za has been operating for years and has a similar operating model as to what I'd imagine this will look like on the ground.

Same thing happened to me, and I'm still waiting for a fair resolution. Was credited 10 of the bitcoins that I purchased more than a week ago. Still waiting on others, and still haven't been credited them at the current market price. The only reasonable resolution, given their mistake.
