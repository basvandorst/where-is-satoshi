I am the "worst kind of human being possible" ?  Because i don't believe in your idea of house hold debt makes you elite?  
Did you eat a bowl of retard-o's for breakfast ?

I have never went to buy one and have them sold out.  As a matter of fact i think ill buy one today and play some online poker for 7% fees.
Yep your poor,  and don't care about fees.  Got it.
Bitcoin will make online gambling easier for people that already have the means.  Poor people will still be victimized by things like vanilla visas and their ridiculous fees.  The same methods they use to get money onto pokerstars now would be used to get bitcoin basically.  It doesn't make it much easier or harder for those without the means.
For those with the means,  it will make it easier, cheaper, and basically frictionless.  
In Canada you basically have to be living on the street to not have a bank account.  There is poor and then theres poor.  The real poor people aren't playing pokerstars to begin with.

"Nobody cares about fees"  
Ugh, and we wonder why the entire western world is basically broke and overextended.  Speaking about Canada where household debt is at ATH high levels.
"Nobody cares about fees"
Maybe we should be caring about fees.

I wasn't complaining, I was saying that fees do matter.  You were disagreeing with me saying no one cares about fees.  I am saying the problem is that no one cares about fees.  Everyone on this continent has so much spare money they can afford to throw out an extra 7% whenever.  To the point that the savings bitcoin would provide in this context is "irrelevant"  not even a talking point.  That is preposterous. 
BTW I may have never been homeless (mainly because as long as my parents still have a house they would never let that happen).  However I have been down and out and poor, I did spend a lot of time in some pretty bad conditions growing up,  I've seen tons of poverty and experienced addictions first hand been right in the thick of it,  more so than i would even like to admit.   So please don't tell me i am "ignorant" of the human experience.  I may be ignorant of being a poor kid in Africa, but short of that i've been high low and everything in between.  I have seen some of the worst of what Canada has to offer anyway.
Having access to credit facilities is one thing.   Abusing them (and saying stupid things like no one cares about fees)  is the problem i am talking about.  It is exactly that "ah, it's only 7%" attitude that made things this way.  ie: WHY FEES MATTER AND PEOPLE SHOULD CARE.  7% for WHAT?!   Bitcoin does this at a fraction of one percent.
Also i don't own my house,  there is a mortgage on that.  It's only half paid for.   I don't subscribe to TV,  but i do torrent a few key shows i like ;)

Vanillas can be bought here at any petro canada or co-op,  probably bunch of other places too. 
Instant e-check lets you use your bank account (without online banking).  Any chequing account works all you need is the numbers on the bottom of your cheque,  just like you were setting up new payroll deposits or something.  Poor people included.
The restrictions were put in place because the financial institutions don't want the RISK of poor people gambling,  not because they give a shit.
Bitcoin (or some form of crypto currency)  will be on pokerstars within 2 years.  
Most likely it will be bitcoin itself,  in 2015.
I am SHOCKED it hasn't happened already.

I was being sarcastic, pretending to be part of the "global elite".
I have a positive net worth,  savings, property, OWN my vehicles outright with no debt on them.  Guess i am NOT part of the "global elite".

Live here,  done it.  
You can use your bank account,  you can use prepaid cards.  Done both.
Lots of credit cards have gambling restrictions.  Maybe 20-30% of cards work.
5-8 years ago different story, most cards worked.
"rich people are the only ones allowed to gamble"  nah..  
I definitely welcome Bitcoin acceptance on pokerstars.
