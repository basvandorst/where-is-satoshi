For the time being, you have to open another channel. In the near future, we will allow you to add funds to existing channels

Eh. I do love working on LN, and I don't consider it a job, but I can say that the only thing that can speed up Lightning is more engineers. I am the only dev behind Zap (I'm Jack Mallers) and I only spend time I can afford to spend. One more dev on Zap and myself officially full-time would make a worlds difference

Hey Really sorry you had that experience. We had a couple of reports of this, and we've pushed a new release 0.6.2 with a fix that should work fine. Can find it here if you're interested:

Hey! I'm Jack, developer behind Zap. As I said in the blog post I only announced today because of the timing with the segwit lock-in. 
The reason I don't want to release the code without proper contribution guide, README, linter, design rules, etc. is because managing an open source project and its code quality is tough. The code is a bit messy still and would not be easy for developers to contribute to productively. I would much rather have these things established and documented before there are any PRs and design discussions :)

You don’t need to run your own LND if you don’t want to. This release comes packaged with running LND non-custodial on your phone

Thanks smeegletoot!
I remember your reddit post about Zap not too long ago, I appreciate all the support

It’s entirely non-custodial, the Lightning node runs on your phone.
It can’t show unconfirmed balance because the node uses neutrino, it’s not a full node.

We decided to make mainnet an entirely different app so that we can keep testing things on testnet. You can download the mainnet version here:

Hey BashCo, it’s Jack. We opted to start a new TestFlight program for mainnet, so we can continue our TeatFlight testnet program for testing ambitious features. The new mainnet release runs LND via neutrino on your iPhone, non-custodial and no remote setup required. You can download it here:

Hey! I'm Jack, the author of the tweet and developer of the app you saw demoed. Correct, I am not a main developer for the Lightning team, I just started this project a few days ago on my own time. 
I do agree that recognizing nodes and public keys is a UX hassle. I just released a MVP demo. I'm working on a feature now where you'll be able to save pubkeys/nodes into a user friendly contacts list. Also allow the ability to scan a QR code.

Hey Hmmm, strange. Sorry about that. If you'd like to join our Slack I'd be happy to help you and get to the bottom of what's going on.
You can find our slack link on our website:

This is due to the fact that you've run LND before and there is already an LND wallet on your machine.
See this issue for more details:

exchanges will offer what users want to trade. they don't determine where the market demand is and what users will/want to trade
