Good looks

You can't just assume normalcy.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:13:03
bitcoin is backed by the full authority of the meme ecosystem
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:54:45
and $25k, 7 seconds after yours.

Where is my BTC-BCH trading GDAX??
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:39:45
Not anyone on Coinbase or GDAX. Seemed like the right time to sell, and then I literally could not
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:19:55
nice caps, really gets me in the mood to do what you say
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:59:43
No YOU'RE a bubble!!
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:57:52
fiat brothers, just keep hodling! USD was worth so much BTC not too long ago. Hang in there!
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:31:03
I'm waiting for BCH-BTC to open on GDAX!
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:53:59
Wow, I did it! How did I manage that?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:56:24
ok it's been 10 more minutes. sell or just hodl each other tight?
Edit: hodl
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:28:24
I totally panic buy
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:38:44
Annoying that Coinbase and GDAX went down just at the right window to not sell when I knew I should have...
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:01:16
Yea except you're not going to chase down a bus that passed by you, especially if it's headed to the moon.
Unless you have superhuman speed or flying... but then why do you care so much about catching a moon bus?

@_date: 2017-12-07 16:55:45
Short term
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:06:02
When it benefits them I guess
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:12:58
It's not giving me enough time to make more money to invest
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:50:27
Why can't I just have it all? I've decided I'm just going to have it all. Just going to do it.
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:49:29
Literally now
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:13:52
Yes, I know of others who do something quite similar...
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:55:21
Last week, I bought and transferred equal amounts of BTC and USD into my Coinbase wallet.
What was I thinking???
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:22:57
Yeah it was more intense than usual, almost like playing some ball and skinning your knee because you're on that fake grass stuff... what do that call it again?
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:58:43
Which do you use then?
