It is disheartening that the Machiavellians at Stratfor found no cause to say anything about **why** individuals might *not* want to outlaw Bitcoin, when they said that governments might find it "unacceptable" to change their taxation and deficit strategies.  Bringing about that "unacceptable" change will be a long and difficult conversation.  However, governments existed for many generations before the current monetary regime.  Change is possible.

The same article is [also posted on Tyler Cowen's blog](


At first this sounds like an easy truism: the mindshare value of money is the expense you'd have to pay to overcome resistance to not using it.  But Mr. Cowen's use of it as an intuition pump fails to account for any marketing cost as sunk; while subjective value in a digital commodity-money remains.  
Thus, if Mr. Cowen paid top James Bond spies several BTC to persuade me to accept DOGE, I would still only have the dubious value of Dogecoin in hand, unless I also had *stored promise of the use of said top spies*, whenever I next found a profitable digital currency transaction, so that I might convince the seller to take said dubious DOGE, instead of the BTC the network would expect.  What we see in this example is that money is made to *hold counterparty risk in its acceptance network over time*, and this has **not** been captured in Mr. Cowen's simplifying arithmetic.


Except it won't have the effect he claims, because the infinite regress of persuasive spies isn't being measured.


Here we see the symbolic tail wagging the economist.  Mr. Cowen claims that if a peer-to-peer network is popular and strong, its innovation (which in the case of peer-to-peer currencies means the value stored in the originating blockchain) may be easier to replace.  He implicitly assumes that everybody who is open to the logic of Bitcoin is equally open to altcoins - because he is not open to the logic of Bitcoin and assumes it is as illogical as the copycats.
I'll skip the broken cellphone analogy, which holds closer to a redesign of the face of paper money.
Mr. Cowen, the larger and more established the Bitcoin-accepting network becomes, the more monetary trust its blockchain will hold, and the less anyone will bother taking a second look at newcomers that serve *almost* the same function, yet *without* similarly wide acceptance.  The positive feedback loop of network effect is Bitcoin's superpower, not its kryptonite.

There is such a way, as a zero-knowledge-proof, proving you at least had a certain balance at one point in time.  We don't have software to make it easy, yet.  Feeding it the blockchain would also currently take a very long time to verify, so further refinements may be necessary before that's possible.  The proof, however, is nice and short, so you could easily paste it in a comment.
I do not know if it is also possible to carry around a proof that you still have any bitcoins.  I suspect it is, if you are willing to provide other people with some bloom filters to verify against you, and a second proof that those bloom filters are sufficient to rule out your coins having moved since the block you completed your first proof.

Late to reply here, but local services can be covered through (HOA style) insurance requirements on homeowners and renters.
This **shifts the question** to one of which insurance agencies have sharing arrangements with your HOA/municipality's providers.  You can imagine the same social structure and bottom line payments as with local government monopoly, yet also allow for competition.  A seemingly crazy idea like competing fire departments might only arise in practice where there is some underlying cost or performance problem with the default local provider.  
If two fire departments could fight for billing rights upon both delivering water to a fire, then we can imagine the HOA/municipality must take the responsibility to require that all the local providers agree to a splitting method, in order to bill insurance.  The kinds of questions government must answer shift from "what should we pay a firefighter" to "do we have sharing metrics that encourage the best providers to serve our area".
So what seem like geographic non-excludable externalities can be covered (since leases and HOA membership **are** excludable) in a way that still allows choice.  Some people will always evade excludable agreements, but they should be a tolerable fraction and of the self-sufficient type (i.e. not worth the expense of going after, to squeeze money out of).  
Those of us who believe that competition matters would like to see the laws written to support competing-yet-sharing providers at all levels of government.  Taken to its logical conclusion, anyone could choose (compatible) competing jurisdiction even in the laws they are responsible to uphold!  The most peaceful way for non-geographic interacting jurisdictions to resolve their edge-differences involves monetization via fine-grained tariff.  You can imagine we still need to build some legal and accounting tools for non-geographical tariff ideas to sound within reach, but the idea of local service competition can be approached through baby steps, as in the earlier examples.

You can find them in old CPU mining code.  You can also look up FLOPS and look for an estimate from someone else.
Supercomputers have always come in all forms (which is why unlike the other responses I don't reject the comparison outright).  Some had broad memory access, some narrow.  They measured in FLOPS because they were all doing numerical physics.  Now, many of them are made with stacks of graphics cards.  The kinds of problems you can solve on stacks of graphics cards are different from those you could solve with a single chip 10 times faster than the one in a laptop, although software can usually slice a problem to best fit the computer given.  Bitcoin mining takes this to an extreme, by making chips that take a few bytes of nonce for coordination, and only run the crypto operations.
Supercomputers are the elephants, weighing many tons.  Bitcoin miners are grasshoppers, collectively weighing a few orders of magnitude more.
Community is a better measure, because a human choosing to spend an hour on one thing versus another is more directly comparable.  Unfortunately, that metric does not shine as brightly under our streetlight.

Yes it is helpful to have many nodes even when they share a network connection, if forking becomes an issue.  Every full node gets a veto on transactions and blocks it doesn't like.  If enough are running the protocol you want, then that protocol may achieve consensus.

If two nodes are running from the same location, it does not provide distributed redundancy against physical attack or failure, but as long as the network pipe is sufficient, it does still allow independent operators to have their say in a blockchain fork.  
Although full nodes do not decide what gets mined, they can still veto transactions or blocks that they don't like.  If only cooperating nodes sourround an uncooperative node, then the uncooperative node is neutralized.  The number of cooperative nodes does play a part in network consensus, but since some miner supernodes try to connect with hundreds of nodes, it's very hard to tell how much effect other full nodes have to the shape of the network.
*TL;DR:*  There's a possible benefit to adding another full node from a location already running one.

You still list gold as having value for different reasons than bitcoins.
Take a further look at gold.  It does not have value because it's shiny or because of any scarcity that's different from Bitcoin's scarcity.   It has value because people agree that objects that degrade are less preferable for trades when long term storage is desirable, and because everybody knows how much work it takes to get gold.  Same with Bitcoin. Think of gold as having won a series of this-or-that contests on what people want to use as money, and Bitcoin facing the same questions every day.  The answer to this-or-that is based wholly on function.
So my point is that those monetary functions are evaluated the exact same way for gold and Bitcoin.  Gold even has a network of transporters and quality testers, like Bitcoin's - it just doesn't have those built-in Internet wings.
I understand that my stance on the shiny issue is a minority view, but I think it's actually critical to a correct understanding.

No one has a provably fair method of wealth (re)distribution.  Usually, through history, it is done very messily, with guns.  What Bitcoin does provide is a provably ~~level playing field~~ *transparent and fixed mechanism* for the issuance of bitcoins, and maintenance of the network.  
Although people are a bit too impatient to wait for it, having a ~~level playing field~~ *transparent and fixed mechanism* may reduce the Gini coefficient, over multiple generations.  It all depends on whether Bitcoin remains a saver's coin, or whether people start borrowing bitcoins at interest.

issue them as needed, after prior banking crises like 1934: such

This picture of Dorian's life ages with an immoral doxxing.  The idea of Bitcoin, and health of its incentivized dev team, still looks young.
I am not confident that this really is the juicy story of why we have Bitcoin today.  It's really juicy, though.  Did he really get foreclosed on?  Did he really bitch about wire fees to the UK (and was that pre-PayPal or something)?  About 6% of 57 year old men will have a stroke, like his, in the next 10 years, and risk cognitive loss.  Did that really happen to him just before he was discovered?

Demonization of hoarding hides a lie that we need to confront, so taking the word back is a necessary step.  Hodlers unite!  
They want it to conjure up money that is never invested, thus wasted.  This viewpoint comes about due to the inadequate instantaneous algrebra economists get caught in, which throws out the important medium and long-term decisions people make about where prices are going and what action they want to take.

It is possible that you are using "economy" in a way that allows any commodity to be an "economy".  Most people define "economy" to include trade and the production of goods within a measurable boundary, and when they measure it, they are trying to measure productive output.
Gold looks good because fiat has issues.  It does not produce anything.  It is a commodity.  I would say the same of bitcoins.
I challenge you to define a "Bitcoin economy" that is separable from fiat economies.  In my example above, I already provided an instance where real productivity gain available in exchange for BTC (not "represented by") could not be separated from the fiat economy's metrics. 
The only thing bitcoins represent is burned work.  They hold value because of how they function.

You've got the right spirit, but should follow through you lack of trust with more research.  The devs are making good choices.  Back during the 2013 blocksize argument, I used to be more worried about their attitudes regarding full node bandwidth scalability verses blocksize; but I've seen the dev team's patience pay off, with work now going into headers-only block distribution, giving us both.  I also respect the effort and testing time these things take.
Regarding Tor, no major OS player could switch to it without paying ongoing CDN-level infrastructure costs to help the network share the load.  There are also real legal costs to running exit nodes.  Infrastructure costs were also more measurable for node-to-node encryption, before chip instruction sets were extended to support it.  Google cares about every fraction of a percent it can shave from its power bill.  And the user interface for mostly-background PGP key management is only now coming together, and to make that easy you still need a piece of hardware you trust.  These are not side problems that any for-profit company can solve easily, although there are now privacy-minded companies out to focus on them - for customers willing to pay.

From the first page of the book:


        neutral countries of Europe (and possibly later the

        formal treaty not to place any obstacles in the way of
        the free dealing throughout their territories in one
        another's currencies (including gold coins) or of a
        similar free exercise of the banking business by any
        institution legally established in any of their
        territories.
Hayek goes on to explain that this would allow people to pull their money out of a failing currency, and this should force governments to issue reliable money.


 utopian scheme of introducing a new European currency, which
 would ultimately only have the effect of more deeply entrenching
 the source and root of all monetary evil, the government
 monopoly of the issue and control of money.

The explanation for why side-chains are insecure is: side chains rely on the 51% assumption.
Discussion of Peter's tree-chains then ensues.
Not discussed: 51% attack on a subtree (which is implementing an altcoin, from which Bitcoin will accept an SPV-like proof to release backing coins, which then propagates up, solidifying over time).  I'm not sure how imagines a feature releasing backing coins, in a way less susceptible to 51% attack than the non-subtree side-chain idea.
BTW, with tree-chain (and mastercoin) notary-only ideas, there's less information about what results the consensus codebase generates (unlike the definitive winnowing done by miners), so everyone is more locked-in to the default client.

While both do build on open ledgers, the main technical difference from Bitcoin is that (at the exchange level) hawala is essentially a credit instrument.

It's a matter of standing.  Only the person wronged gets to complain.  It's supposed to cut down on spurious lawsuits, but government uses it to keep regular people from changing bad things.
As pointed out in the article, Ulbricht has apparently admitted that some of his communication went across Silk Road.  If so, that should be enough to establish a privacy interest.  This can be argued on appeal.
**edit:** I see two key legal questions.  The first is privacy interest in communications over a server, regardless of who controls the server, as mentioned above.  The second is whether facts affecting standing are established by your own claims, or by accusations against you, or by facts established at trial.  IOW, can Ulbricht argue that *if* the FBI were correct about his ownership of the server *then* he has a privacy interest.

Thank you for this very clear explanation of Bitcoin's most compelling  ~~intrinsic~~ value proposition as low-fee online transactions, in answering why it has non-zero price.
Szabo argues, in ["Shelling Out"]( that embodied work need only be recognized and trusted to create value that can be traded.  The result of the work (e.g. beads on a necklace) need not provide "intrinsic" utility.  It is a dramatic departure from Mises, because it posits that humans need money itself, and know how to look for things that can (and thus will) functionally act as money.
[Here](is an older discussion touching upon this, with pointers to references yet further back.
**edit:**  Rereading your comment, I find my comment unnecessary.  You state a "value proposition", which is true.  You do not call it "intrinsic value".  You also describe the electricity used to create the blockchain.  I would not call electricity required to create the blockchain commodity value, but rather proven work (no biggie).  I think your focus on proven work indicates you already understand everything I reference.

You can still trade for personal use without registering as a MSB.  For FinCEN to claim otherwise would completely outlaw private use of money, which USG has not dared to do since FDR.  Now, the limits for what is personal use may not make you happy.  I seem to remember a few hundred dollars worth per day, but don't remember if that was guidance or USC.
**edit**: [31 CFR 1010.100.ff.8.iii "Limitation"]( excludes a natural person acting "*on an infrequent basis and not for gain or profit*".  It does not mention a daily limit, and I don't know where I got that idea.  My reading is that providing liquidity based on a spread, like the Localbitcoins software encourages, *would be* for profit; so except for your claim of "ALL", I would agree with you.  Safe activity may be where one completes no more than one transaction per week with all transactions of the same type (whether buys or sells).  Then it's difficult for them to claim you are acting for gain or profit - perhaps you are acting to pay your bills or to diversify your risk.  As a disclaimer I believe money is free speech and its transmission cannot be regulated in the US on Constitutional grounds, but my view will not prevent them from pulling guns on anyone.

The argument for ETH to take off as a **long-term** scarce resource requires evidence that *verifiable yet uncensorable* computation has some intrinsic network effect - one for which cryptographic advances cannot offer any alternative solution.
Bitcoin transacts between users creating a network effect with *adoption* enabling more fruitful exchange.  The original *scarcity limit* of 21 million bitcoins gives each unique meaning.
Ethereum's *verifiable yet uncensorable* computational service **cannot be kept scarce** with adoption.  If a competing æthereum service offers similar features, then there is **no network effect advantage** for Ethereum, that increases with Ethereum adoption, unless its mining network offers more security with more growth.  Some [newer cryptographic advances]( are poised (over the course of several years of research) to offer **verified computation at cost**, which nullifies the advantage of more security in a more powerful mining network (or a more diverse one - in the maybe-someday case of POS).
In the medium term, Ethereum needs to be tried, and the world needs to see what can be done with it!  Once competitors arise, value pouring into the Ethereum network will remain limited by marginal security advantage (such as from a better mining network), rather than seeing the power-law growth of a network effect based on adoption, unless some unique-to-Ethereum inter-application advantage takes over.  As long as the dev team works hard and it remains the best tool for the job, value will draw towards ETH.  Over the long run, ETH will not be priced like BTC.

Coinbase is "trying", which means they've kowtowed to regulators, but the regulators have not granted them the required licenses yet.  They are not making obvious mistakes, but aren't exactly waiting for a green light, either.  As part of this balance, they pretend to not run an exchange.  USG's tolerance of them depends on the pull of the VC egos backing them, rather than a clear right to operate.

You are correct that were any existing altcoins to take over - or even survive convincingly - they will damage Bitcoin to the point of damaging themselves (except there's room for Namecoin to thrive).  Sidechains were invented to allow experimentation without this "inflation" - although sidechains still allow an altcoin-like asset, so have not completely solved the problem.  
There is a **value-preserving upgrade experiment** that does no damage.  Aethereum (an altcoin which hasn't yet started) proposes an initial distribution using UXTO (the address balances) from Bitcoin.  Even if Aethereum ideas cannot merge into the main Bitcoin client, and even if they suggest futher splits will be needed, they preserve the value of bitcoins.

The Bitfinex borrowing question is a good one, and as of my writing, seems unanswered.  What makes Bitcoin harder than gold to manipulate in this way is that borrowing (and the dreaded rehypothecation) is limited by ease of personal cold storage, and the possibility of transparent accounting mechanisms when stored by a third party.
Suppose Bitfinex, or a similar exchange, or an eventual ETF, does have a mechanism for the very borrowing manipulation you fear.  Unlike centralization of gold storage (with most of the gold - which is in trade - guarded in New York and London, I presume), the borrowed float available in vulnerable Bitcoin markets *could* remain very small, if standard practice is to withdraw coins to cold storage, or if multisig or other accounting safeguards are used.  If traders leave coins in major exchange wallets that don't provide these safe guards, or if there are even bigger third-party wallet heists than we've seen already, then we'll have more to fear.
Eventually, of course, the free-market interest rate for loaning coins would also matter, as would the infinity of dollars required to keep the scheme going.

Imagine a government tacking on KYC requirements to the point that Bitcoin fees exceed credit card fees.

Coinbase stands up for the little guy pretty well, here.  I've found three incentives to do so:

1. A business facing harm is the best voice for their VC backing to speak out about innovation in general.
1. BitLicense has a clause - argued against in this response - which would rope them into checking license compliance for any little business that might want to use Coinbase services.  Coinbase wants these startups as their biggest customers, and later as acquisition targets.
I feel like this is a pretty healthy alignment, so far.  Nice writing, Coinbase!

You are correct, that's what I was arguing.  I'm saying that USD debt is largely (but not entirely) against the banking establishment, and its loans.


The connection is that when banks are undercollateralized, such as due to falling asset prices, the rules say they have to write off debt, which means writing off fractional-reserve dollars in their [excess reserves]( which are directly measured in M0.  So we do see a direct connection between M0 and the ability to collect a bank's asset of a certain value.
*edit:* I noticed you keep talking about sound money and sound
bank loans.  I'm not arguing for soundness of any part of the
system I described.  I'm just saying that when it's operating,
there are promises and goods that can be extracted for many (not
all) of the dollars that have been assigned into existence.

You are correct here, and this is very important.  Your comments on the
pressures against Bitcoin fractional reserve (all of which are
technological defenses) are also on target.
However, you are wrong about what collateralizes the dollar.


No.  Not anymore.  It's an IOU on whatever promise the borrower
made to an accredited bank.  Such banks, in the US, are private,
and the Federal Reserve authorizes them to issue USD according to
capitalization and reporting rules, like [Basel
III](  (Note that this
is different from other debt, like that against credit cards,
which remains private and is not counted in
Banks give both collateralized and non-collateralized loans, but
they are much stricter if you do not bring them a title to hold
as collateral.  Generally, if you're not betting the farm
(house), then they want to see very steady business income.  This
means that the dollar is built upon American real estate value
and the promised profitability of American businesses (and public
bank bailouts when those fail).  When you think about how hard
people are working in all those American businesses, then even
though it's an intangible and maybe nobody will come to work
tomorrow and keep things going, it's not exactly a blank promise,
either.  Foreign assets aren't disallowed, but under Basel III
they can affect the Liquidity Coverage Ratio.  Land and business
describes most of the value behind the dollar.
In theory, when you pay off your mortgage, or any other bank
loan, it *cancels dollars* sitting on the bank's balance sheet
(or issued against a mortgage recently bought by the Federal
Reserve and sitting on *their* balance sheet, as a form of
proactive bailout).  When the payoff mechanism is operating
correctly (fractional reserve leverage considerations aside),
then it is fair to say that the private banking system is issuing
dollars against new assets that were brought into the economy.
So the debt-based banking system encourages people to **monetize
their land and businesses**.  The transition from non-debt money
to debt-based money meant that there were initially lots of fresh
assets to collateralize, but now that well is much more dry.
There is one more special issuer, that despite leading the way to
debt-issuance in the 1860's, still played a very small part in
the scheme in 1971, but is now growing to control much more of
the the debt the dollar represents: Congress (and its political
enablers: Treasury and the Federal Reserve).  They create
deficits which require interest payments on bonds.  Their debt
fits your complaint perfectly: it **is** nothing but on IOU,
backed by whatever scary violence is required to plausibly get
you - citizens - to pay them enough taxes (someday) to cover all
of it.  You know, to win *the wars on everything and
everybody*...  When people complain about the debt system, they
are right to focus on this injustice, but it is not (yet) the
principle component of what backs USD.
Bitcoin's underlying commodity-scarcity value is **of course** a
massive improvement on dollars based on collateralized assets
brought into regulated-but-slightly-decentralized private
banking, because Bitcoin's "deflationary" monetization is totally
global and market driven, as has been gold's since ancient times.
Unlike gold, there are no fee problems from storage or physical
transportation, there is the potential to almost completely
eliminate thefts based on scary violence, and there is that
wonderful promise of the pressures against Bitcoin fractional
reserve.  As with any commodity, there is no foreseeable way for
the US Congress to capture Bitcoin's issuance logic for IOU
deficits - you know, to continue the
financial-prison-military-industrial complex...
**TL;DR:** Debt-based dollars primarily represent monetization of
US real estate, US businesses, and US taxpayer obligations.
Despite there being assets sitting behind each of those, the
debt-dollars are ultimately enforced by USG's credible threat to
enable banks and the IRS to take things when the debts aren't
paid, and this is part of why USG is so crazy-sensitive about its
power projection image.  Bitcoin's non-debt nature offers a
workable and totally nonviolent alternative, but society has a
long way to go, to learn once again how to live with less debt.

Where does the wealth come from?  This is an interesting question because the answer isn't the same as for gold.  Several factors:
* dollar inflation will create some part of those dollars out of thin air, making everyone who believes in dollars poorer (just like gold)
* the things you - or robots - can do with bitcoins will create wealth, even though some of this wealth will manifest as price deflation
* billions (2.5) of people without access to PayPal or regular banking will have fast reliable economic connections, making the products available to you better, and creating wealth
* the wealth you create by not standing in line at Western Union (whether you then cook your own dinner or sell more widgets) will decrease your preference for existing dollars, making them cheaper to you
* wealth created by people who are not ultimately working within the US financial system will gradually strengthen Bitcoin's trade-weighted prices, and make bitcoins scarcer on markets that exchange for dollars
* people will regain some personal control of the 8.6% of US GDP (well over a trillion dollars) that falls into the financial sector
* governments will have less customers buying bonds, and their cost of borrowing (which most of them successfully ignore) will go up, which will increase inflation pressure
* "people that got in later" will pay higher prices because the world is always in transition to the best store of value available, and Bitcoin changed the game the moment it was announced
Even though there are some elements of price deflation here, I accept your premise that Bitcoin's scarcity will result in upward-trending BTCUSD; mostly due to the network effects of money.
The key perspective is that the dynamics of a shift to a better store of value (whatever value is to humans) are as rich as the underlying transactions exchanging value.  It is the essence of progress.  It is not zero-sum, but it is not wholly outside of the realm of competition, either.
Keep in mind that at every point, everyone who participates does so because they believe it can help them, in that moment.  From that perspective, nobody coming to Bitcoin late is losing out (provided they take a mature viewpoint on their investment risk, and don't put themselves in a position where they can't accept the possible consequences).

Most people do not understand Bitcoin in a few hours.  Here is what I’d want to teach.
[Some dollar history](is required.  Teach about inflation and who it benefits.  Bonus points if you link in Roman history.
Understand the differences between credit and commodity money!  I posted [some thoughts on related reading material in this thread](Understand the primary functions of money.  Understand subjective theory of value.  See [links here](The [history of e-gold, is essential political context]( and explains why PayPal can’t innovate the same way.
For discussion about Bitcoin’s potential I still like [The Bitcoin Phenomenon](from 2013 (35 minutes).  
I would spend only half of your allotted time helping them set up cell phone wallets and getting fractions of coins safely onto paper wallets.  Note which wallet options are distributed, and which have central points of failure.  Warn that private keys must never be transmitted over the Internet in the clear.
I would not explain much about how Bitcoin works, other than to emphasize that no particular participants are central to its operation.  Smart kids can [research that themselves]( if they get turned on to it.  They can try to read [Satoshi’s whitepaper]( - most sections of which will make sense to anyone who can imagine that a hash is a lot like a fingerprint.  There’s also a great collection of historical technical literature (as a reference list to leave behind) at the [Nakamoto Institute](
For the technical basis of future possibilities, [Mike Hearn’s 2012 talk]( on [smart property]( shows the way.  We also have a recent Bitcoin-inspired-but-not-Bitcoin example of future possibilities with [The Republic of Doug](
Even though you teach a technology program, Bitcoin is as amazing for [*why we want it*](as for the cutting edge computer science it relies on (which includes, BTW: cryptographic hashes, elliptic curve cryptography, proof-of-work, the blockchain invention as solution to the Byzantine Generals Problem, bloom filters, now invertible bloom lookup tables, and soon zero-knowledge proofs) - especially given that it's just a ledger at heart.

Gold's returns beyond measured fiat inflation (which I did not address well in the other reply to this post) could indicate either mismeasurement in fiat inflation, expectations of future fiat inflation, or growth in the international network of potential gold buyers.
IOW, every time a potential gold buyer gains wealth, we should expect their willingness to pay higher prices for gold to store that wealth to also increase. I still wouldn't define the group of potential gold buyers as an economy, no matter what their prevailing economic activity.

The good thing about sidechains is that we can be selective about what sidechains we participate in, once we can see their properties.  You don't have to move coins to an SPV-only sidechain.
I'm overall positive about the sidechain-enabling opcode, because I recognize that testing limited-duration pegged sidechains is the best way for Bitcoin (the main chain) to test features for inclusion that could otherwise obsolete it.
For all the worries in this thread, I submit that current altcoins have the most to lose, due to plain old competition through innovation.  Sidechains are the way for Bitcoin to integrate their best features into the strongest network, and sidechains give privileged transfers back to the main Bitcoin chain (although there are real SPV concerns to be aware of and search for technical solutions to).

Yes, but.  The state has always exercised its power to take one's money.  In earlier times, this literally meant taking one's gold.  That's why OP's references to guns are important.  In practice, gold was complicated enough to protect that it was either hidden by the owner and not available for transactions, or protected by a bank and available for transactions.  One could not easily choose both.  If you wanted to make transactions then you opened yourself up to government seizure.  Bitcoin does allow both resistance to seizure and immediate availability for transactions.  This is a fundamental shift in the balance of power between individual persons and the people's collective actions as government.
Government still has the power of extortion.  They can scare you by threatening to destroy your life, but if you're using your bitcoins properly, the ultimate choice to pay them remains yours.

I can now explain clearly why its hogwash.


it does not back the dollar. The collateralized banking system
requires both collateral AND sound money to operate.
I understand our main difference.  My explanation doesn't focus
on what will survive.  It says what is.
Let's start with
and bear with me while we use Q to represent not real value
already used in aggregate expenditures, but rather real value
sitting on the sidelines as collateral.  (You don't have to
accept the formula, because it's the thesis of my posts here that
such collateral should apply at all, but if you let me use it to
describe our viewpoints then I can show you why we're arguing
past each other.)  Our Q is distinct from all money supply M,
unlike a saved dollar under a mattress, as we're talking about Q
as collateral - houses, business promises, and tax promises - and asking if changes affect P.  Then
note that if M is rising, and Q isn't, then P is going to rise,
as you describe in hyperinflationary currency failure.
Rising monetary quantity (M) is a constant political activity
with fiat currencies, has generally held at about 2% for gold
discovery, and is programmed to drop to 0% with Bitcoin.


the fact the currency is used in collateralized loans, and those
loans won't stop the currency from failing at all (as history
shows in hundreds of cases of currency failure).
You are looking at M and noticing that one can't have sound money
if M is moving (especially if moving faster than people can adapt
to), even if Q is well understood.  You note that I have not
explained a way for fiat money to keep M steady, and thus even if
there is some collateral behind fiat money, it won't stop bad
things from happening.
I am looking at Q, and saying that even though Q is no longer
simple to understand, *it still exists, and is an important part
of the equation*.  That's actually all I'm saying.  It's still a
narrow correction of your original statement that the dollar is
an IOU on an asset long defaulted upon.  It used to be simple to
substitute in actual gold (as long as politicians let you, which
meant not in the US during most of 1933 or post-1971).  Despite a
simple Q, even gold-pegged USD was not ultimately sound money, as
we now know; due to that era's political problems with M.


the banking process is nonsense.
Perhaps my perspective offering allows you to now agree that it's
not nonsense, because it still allows room for your concerns
about failure.
As an aside, it is the thesis of the banking industry that if Q
rises (perhaps when someone monetizes their house via mortgage)
at the very same time that M rises (perhaps via creating dollars
to give to the borrower who offered their house), then you have economic growth with
price stability for P.  It is the thesis of Bitcoin that P can be
perfectly flexible in any direction, including "deflationary"
down, so the economy does **not** need to wiggle M when it
discovers value, as adjustments to P will ripple outward from
whatever value was created; and that this mechanism is even more
natural and decentralized than the banking industry's approach.
**TL;DR:** I do not speak to whether fiat money is sound or
unsound.  Non-gold monetary collateral exists, and we can
understand it separate from "printing" problems of monetary

It wasn't, and that's the point.  Yet it settled a debt or traded for money or valuable goods.  
In Eric's world, exposed via the highly confusing quote that started this thread, it's the collateralization of the gold that makes it a financial instrument.  He's not interested in whether a commodity can trade for things of value, or settle a debt, and so [his financial instrument formula spits out a zero, and he blogs about it]( as you've linked elsewhere in this thread.
Some things hold value better than others, and ultimately international trade does put the thinking process into play that Menger (incorrectly) used to explain the origins of coinage.  Add in Szazbo's descriptions of proof of work, and these are the concepts underlying commodity money.  They don't depend on a narrow definition of financial instruments, and they explain why gold bullion and bitcoins have international market value.  For any commodity, Eric would say the market value doesn't follow his formulas for computing a promised fair value, and so can't be the basis of a "sound monetary system".  This is separate from any claim of market value.
Why so many economists think a sound monetary system should hide fluctuations in supply and demand, while also inviting unlimited moral hazard via government deficit spending, is left as an exercise for the reader.

The point is that deflation shows weaknesses in banks' asset sheets, where they need strength in order to maintain the fiction of fractional reserve.  When their [reserve ratios]( fall below 10% (in the US), then they are no longer licensed to play bank; including authorizing your debit transactions, and filling their ATMs.  Normally at this point the FDIC steps in, but that process usually involves a few rounds of letters, and if something systemic happens, then the [FDIC's chronic underfunding]( may come into play, or they may need a few days to ship crates of cash to a bunch of banks all at once.

Sign a 1-of-n transaction to the n whitelisted receiving addresses.  Broadcast **or store** this transaction as the "cold storage wallet".  If the transaction is not broadcast, then burn the original private key.
The example is confusing because you don't actually have to put the transaction in cold storage, and the whitelisted address owners also need some way to cold-store *their* wallets, to access these whitelisted addresses.  
The advantage of not broadcasting the transaction, and actually using it as a key to the cold storage "wallet" (which then isn't technically a wallet), depends on how access control to the cold storage vault is assured, and what the hot-wallet threats are.

Thank you for an insight into Eric's surprising quote.  Physical things, when they are used in the transmission of value, become part of its trust chain.  It's no confusion to care deeply about how work is transformed into tradeable value.
From Eric Tymoigne's ["Money: An Alternative Story"]( page 11:


By pages 13 and 14, Tymoigne is discussing international payments and sovereign default, and explains that "coins with precious metal content" were demanded as payment from the sovereign, yet goes on to state:


He's right that debt motivated these transactions, and that when the debt could be enforced another way then collateralization was possible.  He's wrong that the bullion received in such a transaction was collateralized.  
For some reason, someone in the transaction chain demanded more than a promise, and was send gold.  Why humans constantly settled on precious metals in these circumstances is better explained by the metals' trustworthy physical properties for holding value (i.e. proof of work), rather than explained by whose face was on a coin.

First, do you realize that your "thin air" phrase is the same as my "issues" phrase?
You understand money creation as it occurs in our banking system, but you did not understand Mike's limited example; which he used as an intuition pump, and which set the context I was replying to.  Mike started with: "If you borrow the very first dollar into existence, and that's the only dollar that exists on the planet..."  Did you watch the video excerpt?  It takes about 60 seconds.  You don't even need audio, because the text he talks is on screen in the animated infographic.  He's talking about the mathematical impossibility of extinguishing debt.
My limited point is that there is not some net sum of leftover losers (whether private, or the government) who *have to borrow* the interest to pay off a loan, if money has velocity.  Mike says, at 13:04, that *in order to pay off a debt, you have to borrow more dollars into existence*.  It's a claim I've seen many times, in many places, and my example shows why it's an incorrect claim.
The purpose of Mike's example is to show you the leftover debt overhang, after the dollars in existence in the economy are extinguished against the debt that created them.  It's true that there are more dollars owed than exist.  It's true that paying back debt, thus canceling it, would be deflationary.  It's **not** true that the debt cannot be paid back.  It's more clear to say that successfully paying back interest on debt requires velocity of money.
I agree with you that fractional reserve has a lot of problems.  I do not agree that I presumed anything about the speed of debt creation.  I provided a fully contained example.

* you repay $0.50 of your loan
* final balances in economy: you and mop-maker have $0, banker has $1.
But you have a mop, and the mop-maker has a clean floor (and some bank services), and the banker has a very clean floor.
Whether or not you think it's *fair* to work for a banker in order to have the opportunity to buy that mop depends on your (conscious or unconscious) view of the [time value of money](  In societies that function on informal credit, where the mop-maker might have trusted you enough to make the mop for you, bankers seem less useful.  Once the mop-maker needs the banker's services too, they may prefer to trade mops for money rather than informal credit.
This example illustrates [velocity of money]( Mike incorrectly assumed a velocity of zero in his trivial example.
**edit:** In real life, upon final debt repayment, the banker gives up any collateral claim, thus extinguishing fractional reserve dollars available for issuing on the balance sheet.  The banker's final balance will then also be $0.  Mike's explanation of "debt as dollar antimatter" comes at 14:15, well after the claim that the $1 loan scenario is impossible to pay back.

While new blockchains can start, it is also true that if the incentives that secured Bitcoin's blockchain do not lead to long-term stabillity, then a simple reboot won't work, either.  Miners need real money to pay real electricity bills.  Something new would have to be tried, and it would be another grand experiment, and could fail similarly, years later.  The lost trust would be a difficult hurdle.
That is why Bitcoin's current blockchain matters more than most people realize.  That is why the developers will remain so conservative, until side chains allow merging of well-tested experiments, instead of just well-reviewed code.

It is basically as difficult as bootstrapping a reputation network of trusted friends and institutions.

If Keynes has some redeeming logic to his comments, it is lost in modern (non gold standard) perpetual deficit funding.  This distinction should be brought out.  What did the politicians like so much, and what obvious consequences have been shouted down, in the ensuing years?

[8.4% of US GDP]( as of 2011.  In the 50's it was down around 3%, and that's including all the ancient paper shuffling.

By Taleb's definition, fragility means accelerating sensitivity to harm.  Bitcoin, like all [networks drawing power from the users]( has some serious failings in its moments of doubt: its deep stability of a deflationary future can get overwhelmed by price swings, risking participants' savings, should they need to transact soon.  There are also questions about rule changes favoring eventual oligopoly in mining.
In Bitcoin's antifragile favor: 
* [convex transition]( from issuance to deflationary future
* peer-to-peer exchange never gets delisted
* enough privacy *potential* to break out of all censorship
* no single person is critical
* already weathering dirty associations with drug money
* Bitcoin code/culture has, *so far*, prioritized privacy and miner incentive over transaction speed
**Blacklisting stolen coins would make Bitcoin fragile**, by opening an attack channel less resilient than a 51% attack.  Of major names I remember, both MtGox and Casascius have tested the waters in recommending this (MtGox in 2011, and Casascius in 2013).  That, and mining changes that destroy anonymity, are perhaps Bitcoin's greatest long-term risks.

It doesn't matter if Bitcoin is the sole currency anywhere.  What matters is how deep in the supply chain you can go without a currency conversion.  
Translated for this concern, you're right that the index doesn't make sense yet, because the point of conversion is after the burger is bought.
Not all of McDonald's beef is locally grown, so even the original index isn't completely free of conversions.  McDonald's probably won't accept anything but the dominant fiat currencies for some time.  Even if someone else makes a similar burger to sell for bitcoins, it will be a while before much of its ingredients can be sourced in bitcoins.  We'll have to accept conversions, and note where in the supply chain they occur.

If you do need to make a call on whether a patch is useful, I offer the following:
* starting a module that remains in some form, through many versions, was a useful architectural addition
* code that later has many patches to it means those later patches should share credit, even if the developers didn't know until the patch was submitted (e.g. security flaws)
* a rocket launch has a clear date to measure success, but most software's success is measured by gradual adoption

I'm with you on value storage, but bitcoins work for "value transaction" by virtue of medium-of-exchange prowess, with a little leaning on fiat for unit-of-account.  Is Bitcoin, among other things, an experiment to prove that mv=pq, and a stable unit-of-account, are not as primal as a store of value?  I'd say maybe, and stop short of saying it can't rise to the level of a currency.  Monetization takes time.

Imagine you live in an unlucky tax-policy country.  You decide to buy something in BTC with early-adopter coinage that cost you almost nothing (low basis); something that's an observable aspect of your lifestyle (i.e. trackable).  But then you have to withdraw 20%-40% extra, to cash back to fiat, to pay taxes on things you're buying *in BTC*.  It just makes me puke.
Now imagine you are aware of this class of goods that are made by tax-exempt organizations.  When you contribute to them, and save a receipt, you do not have to pay income tax on the gains you transfer to them.

I agree that in the non-hypothetical cases looser supply of money
is somewhere at play, whether as direct printing or gradually
accumulated bubble due to low interest rates.


I'm suggesting that a hypothetical supply shock (from sanction,
disaster, or war) *is* a reduction in q, even with constant m
(not printing it).  
Imagine hungry people, not giving a damn what
their money is worth tomorrow, if they can get today's bread.


  would anyone demand it less, without reason.
Time preference is a reason.  Stomachs are relentless.  War makes
plans uncertain.


  will ever be found to be inflationary after the last bitcoin is
  mined? Not a chance. Even now, at a controlled inflation rate,
  it's still long-trend deflationary.
Bitcoin's constantly-lower-prices pressure will continue while it
reaches its global market saturation potential (due to stronger
network effects increasing q, for the same m).  This may reach
equilibrium before or after 2140.  Even then, supply shocks
(less q) could affect local prices.  Some would call any briefly
higher p "price inflation", but given constant m, I'd agree that isn't an
"inflationary Bitcoin".

It should be obvious that the actual US outcome will be overregulation, arbitrary harsh enforcement, further normalization of System D, and gradual decline of the empire.

Well said, mostly, but be aware that despite the initiating value spark of a decree to pay your taxes in dollars, or prohibition against gold, the dollar's value is also subject to market "consensus".  
This is most obvious when dollars are accepted overseas, alongside other currencies.  The benefits of trade with US subjects are judged several degrees of separation from those directly subject to US threats.  Such judgement must also take into account arbitrary actions like Federal Reserve manipulations.  These collective forces influence exchange prices.
You used the common idiom of market consensus; and while I have no objection to it, I put consensus in scare quotes because all transaction decisions are local, and depend on personal judgements about value.  Even the choice of which metric to aggregate reported transactions with is an independent one.

Mr. Brito, you just missed an opportunity to explain that MSB laws only protect consumers when someone else's ledger balance is in use, and must be trusted.

Mr. Allaire has no incentive to explain this, as it invites competition.

The nongeographic Bitcoin nation creates *the supply chain of goods available in Bitcoin*.  Due to the nature of Bitcoin, those prices move a lot!  They move *mostly* when collective players say that Bitcoin is overvalued on the exchanges, relative to big currencies like USD.  *Sometimes* they also move when a merchant offers a price discount for BTC, or when a merchant hedges against their local currency rather than USD, or when a micropayment is anchored near the transaction fee.  
The supply chain's pricing choices are not entirely against the most stable unit-of-account that customers are familiar with, and this represents Bitcoin's penetration into that role.  Note that a small part of a pricing choice could take BTC factors into account (like localbitcoins pricing), and yet the sticker price could end up in USD.  If a product is made of other products purchased in BTC, the USD cost component could be small, perhaps covering only labor and transportation.  When the BTC supply chain is deep, it will be acting as a unit-of-account without needing the coercive monopoly power of a fiat currency.
Unit-of-account is a winner's circle, reserved for the biggest currencies.  Only the most stubborn minds would try to force it before its time (and risk arbitrage against their products).  Even gold, the global standard for hundreds of years, had its place yanked by a viscious 40 year prohibition campaign in America, and subsequent attacks by worldwide central banks.
This one is going to take some time, but it is still within our sights.  There is no shame in a child passing by a chance to steal a smoke of cigar.  When we are ready, the cigar will be offered to us, and it will taste so much sweeter for that.

There are several ways to understand "deflation", but one of the most common is that goods seem to cost less.  This *is* occuring with goods priced in Bitcoin.  You can think of it as demand for the money (as savings) exceeding demand for the goods.

Pretty good reply.  I agree they are using the children.  But you gave them the hinging fact: that child pornography is driven by commercial interest at all in the first place.  You have to challenge that too, and searching "history of commerical child pornography" will set you on your way ([thanks Wikileaks](
There does appear to have been a period of obvious Internet commercial CP activity, while the laws were just being implemented.  The Bitcoin community, which draws *all of its strength* from uncensored transactions, and which is in the minority for thinking that centralized censorship has *any* drawbacks, will not win on "they care about protecting themselves from revolt".  We are going to need to break down their "saving the children" claim piece by piece.  And where they *are* saving the children, we'll need to come up with creative and effective means of distributed community policing, for achieving the same.

Well, I could be wrong here, but I think you're misundrstanding my attack.
The difficulty of finding a collision in human-memorable space is limited by how many words the humans see.  That won't be a bitcoin address collision, and it won't even be the first (as in firstbits) use of that human-memorable name, but it doesn't matter if the attacker gets to send their own Merkle branch.  A thin client won't be able to prove it's not firstbits.
It just occurs to me that a combination of bloom filter and a tree structure could answer a low-dimensionality firstbits query with a date range, in constant space.  Since bloom filters can be wrong, the name generation algorithm would have to take this into account, providing determinism and steering around false positives.  Legacy query results would have to survive many future versions, so you'd want to allow expansion to more than three memorable words, too.
In combination with the Merkle branch, for exact address lookup, a thin client could then reasonably believe that this was a unique memorable name.

We can look to the era of [illegal gold ownership in the US]( for guidance (1933-1971).  USG did not search bank safety deposit boxes for gold.  At least one person created a situation where their gold, in a bank, became known to USG, who then stole it (after the executive order was tested in the courts, which bent over willingly).  
In the case of Bitcoin, this would look like getting swatted and seeing all your computers disappear, for evidence against you, in your witch trial.  Hopefully that does not reveal your keys.
During gold prohibition, as a result of foreign options for ownership, interesting gold holding companies were born.  If you look at the history of commodity ETFs, you see that a Canadian, in 1961, figured out how to run a company that just stored gold in a vault, and got it listed on US exchanges.  Since gold usually requires a counterparty anyway, when holding large amounts, this was not much worse than legal ownership.  This stock market blockade-running (easy for the rich but inaccessible to the poor) is probably what forced Nixon to relent about gold ownership.
**tl;dr:** Give Wall Street a way to sell it as paper, and they will help you keep it liquid and legal.  But hold your own, and be ready to ignore orders that you help the government steal it!

Have you forgotten the time before Bitcoin?  Back when only cypherpunk theorists and bankers could have had this conversation?  If it weren't for Satoshi's thoughtful balance of potentially-anonymous miners, there would be nothing inevitable about cryptocurrencies.  
The US still maintains a list of countries, and individuals, who it's illegal to transact with.  This power depends on being able to arrest bankers.  The moment they can, regulators will reassert their primacy in this domain.  They will not sit down for a debate about the opportunity costs of enforcement, or whether stating a value transfer is freedom of speech.  They can only be shown that yet another desired power is not theirs, but ours.

Surprisingly story-oriented.  I expected a much more conceptual-upload-oriented description.  Where technicals are imparted, it's done while trying to tell me why they're necessary, or with metaphorical aides.  I feel that in an encyclopedia, these various perspectives should be in separate sections.  I have no idea what EB has become, though.  For instance, should it be written with timely concerns in mind (e.g. Early days), or as a kernel of truth for the ages?  All depends on the update policy.
The PK-crypto section is mostly not answering that question.  It is describing how bitcoins are secured, and what the issuing algorithm is (hashes are not PK-crypto).
Governments issue currencies, not moneys.  In my personal taxonomy, moneys means mostly the same thing, but includes any good's inherent durability/fungibility/scarcity/unit-of-account; thus allowing, to some degree, chickens (where the market trades in them) and gold.

Thank you for your merchant-on-the-street viewpoint.
Monetization volatility ends when everybody with economic standing knows how to use Bitcoin.  For Bitcoin's overall success, store-of-value is much more important than merchant transactions.  Meanwhile, it's probably the case that either you could accept fiat, or your customers could store more fiat in exchanges.
There is probably a formula, based on option interest, which you could use to estimate customer losses from rising price, and offer to split the difference with them as a  discount.  You'd also raise your BTC price in advance, in downturns.  It's risky.  You could tune it for the amount of coin you keep after costs, though that would make it less attractive.
Gresham's Law is also at play.  That is a bit different from monetization, but causes the same speculative hoarding behavior.

*AnalogDoubter* generations have a (subconscious) point in that the process guaranteeing limited issuance (to 21M) requires assessing the incentives/politics of a large ecosystem.  
The protocol is a group decision where many participants actively vote (the full verification nodes).  Its rules implement the peer-to-peer process of immediate shunning, preventing schism.  But even that is complicated to explain, since the verify-or-shun algorithm is not *yet* set in stone.  Rules like maximum-block-size are changing.  Developers must listen to the will of *ThePeople*, but with few options and swarms of newcomers, the people could be swayed.  
For an *AnalogDoubter* who spent decades frustrated that *ThePeople* were unwittingly losing freedom as their rules changed, I can excuse some additional default wariness.

For those of you lucky enough not to understand why explaining divisibility matters, the reason people get caught up on this is that the state education myth, about why we don't have a gold standard (really just a peg), was that gold was too scarce, so prices became illiquid and volatile.
This is what I was told in a US public high school, when I asked what was wrong with the gold standard, upon learning about Nixon's ending of gold convertibility.  I had never heard of a goldbug, yet remember the question, and a feeling of distinct dissatisfaction with the answer.  The real answer is that I was being scammed.  Bitcoin shows the fiat scam, and protects one from it.

"* is political" is an idiom, not a definition.  
It means that the subject is controversial; that it enables humans to take actions that have real consequence in this world.
You're wrong to pretend it's "simply a protocol".  You know that what makes a money is human judgement.  There are tens of thousands behind the network, agreeing to make transactions when prices look good to them now, or contributing to the idea of real savings when prices will get better later.  There are also the miners in action.  These things are not the Bitcoin protocol, and Bitcoin the money and payment network would be a dead (academic, apolitical) idea without them.  You know this because your money sometimes sells for a new price, even when your protocol hasn't changed a bit.
Bitcoin draws plenty of cringeworthy political attention.  Perhaps storing value is the simplest nonviolent action.  With even that having political consequence, I cannot say "it merely is".

I agree that were the Regression Theorem worded more loosely, we could adapt our understandings through its lens, since subjective value theory reigns.  However, such a definition goes circular, as one claims the historical reasoning for something being money is that people see its future monetary value.  We need no regression (because, as I claim, we are not using the Regression Theorem), but any regression theorem does.
[Quoting from Mises]( as copied from the [linked pedantic discussion](&gt; If we trace the purchasing power of money back step by step, we finally arrive at the point at which the service of the good concerned as a medium of exchange begins.

I upvote you a lot.  Let's talk about this.  Can we agree on [quantity theory of money](  
I think in the case of Venezuela, you're right that higher interst rates, and an expectation of inflation, play a key role; whether the money has arrived yet or not.  But higher v or lower q can also push p higher, decreasing the demand to hold money.  
Now granted, v is mostly going to react to future expectations, but reducing friction in payment systems might, for instance, increase v in some natural process.  What about q - can we drop it off a cliff?  Well, yes, we can, in circumstances of limited supply: sanctions, disasters, and possibly even generalized fear.  
Would q, and thus p, "recover" from disruptions like that?  Under good governance, yes.
The point is only that p does not respond to m alone, as your statements seem to suggest.

People care very much whether transactions in the memory pool are allowed to be rewritten.  The resolution chosen (which does seem like it has room for improvement) is implemented by the "satoshi client", and is considered as much a part of the unwritten specification as any other rule on which transactions may be mined into the blockchain.  Should some clients disagree, they will end up mining invalid blocks, and peers will drop them; so there is economic incentive.  If 51% of the network agrees to the rule (as now), it will stand.
The fact that Bitcoin's protocol is imbued in an executable (rather than an IETF RFC; or an authoritative whitepaper, complete with all the rules; or even the wiki) is not ideal, but it is something we live with.

Very few coins escaped via the MtGox hack.  That's not an issue.  I'll let someone else explain that hack.
Compromised, or "tainted", coins are just like hot gear at the pawn shop, or at an auto chop shop.  Somebody said their computer got hacked, and they pointed at a transaction in the Bitcoin ledger.  The coins are moderately identifiable, for a while (or for a long time, if the thief is stupid).
The Bitcoin community currently runs under a consensus that tainted coins are as safe as US Federal Reserve Notes tainted with traces of cocaine: they work fine.  If you lose bitcoins, it's your own fault, and the way to get even is via contacting the police, rather than asking the network to shun others who might quickly get stuck with taint from the heist.
MtGox toyed with keeping a blacklist due to an incident unrelated to their own breakin, in 2011, but backed off when they realized how toxic the idea was to essential characteristics of money's fungibility.
Unlike many other economically relevant rules in the Bitcoin network, this one has not yet been written into the code, to be enforced via mining and p2p consensus.

It'll happen.  Fractional reserve and rehypothecation too.  But institutions sporting those features will be more prone to failure (because there are no central bank bailouts in Bitcoin), and prices will reflect their reputations.  
The main check on all this activity is that it's easy enough to take "in-kind" delivery of Bitcoin.  
If "banks" have the money they loan out, and they evaluate projects based on expected rate of return, then they start to sound like Venture Capital.
History is rife with [downturns caused by bank failures]( usually closely tied with fraud.  Companies cease work, and preople reshuffle what value remains.  In many ways, those were ages of more mature customers, who had to have a sense of where their money really was.

Caring about one another arises from empathy, which is possible when mutually respecting individual boundaries.  This includes not stealing from one another.  There is no need to apply pressure to redistribution, because the first casualty is empathy, and the sharing goes sour anyway.
When people are free, and not scared, they will produce what they can, and share as widely as they can afford.  It is the most honorable thing anyone can think of.

speculation and total control over your money.  
Total control cannot be achieved when you rely on anything with

I found this a challenging topic.  It's clear the hosts agreed on "do something", but it's not clear that scrypt parallel ASICs on custom motherboards wouldn't also rise to 10,000x the power of my desktop.  Doing something may just shuffle an oligarchy along political lines: hardly how we want to run Bitcoin.
There are several complicating factors which the hosts missed completely.  
* Litecoins are being mined on GPUs.  Work on Litecoin ASICs has begun.  Scrypt may be too complicated to rule out hardware development completely.
* Litecoin chose memory to fit in L2 cache.  It's possible higher memory requirements would eliminate GPU use.  What are the politics of the L2 boundary?
* "Nova" claims, of scrypt ASIC development: "It's much, much harder than SHA256 and the hash rate will never be equal to an ASIC running SHA-256, but relative speed ups should theoretically remain the same as we saw in the progression of BitCoin mining." And "2112" says, "those who tell don't know, those who know don't tell".  Yikes!  More [on Bitcointalk](

Wrong, *wrong*.  **Wrong.**  
Ignorant is one thing, but ignorant and calling others ignorant -
well that takes an idiot.  Go learn [what money
is]( before attaching an
argument only to Bitcoin's medium of exchange feature.
Bitcoin is both the payment mechanism *and* the money.  It *is* a
store of value (the best ever devised).  The exchange rate is
all-important to keeping score on whether it will gain widespread
adoption.  If it is not widely adopted, then its store of value feature will suffer.  When anything gains widespread adoption *as money*, we
call that monetization.  All asset bubbles are partial
monetization events.  Gold shows sustained monetization.
It is even questionable whether Bitcoin-the-medium-of-exchange
could survive an exchange attack that would lead to total loss of
stored value.  Unlike pure mediums of exchange (such as
credit cards), Bitcoin's transactions *do* suffer if the exchange rate
goes south.  Miners would lose incentive, the block adjustment
period would stretch far into the future, and transactions would
no longer be fast and secure.
**TL;DR:** Bitcoin is money, stupid.
*edit*: I do agree that to understand its potential, the other disruptive effects listed are very helpful.  If I read the author's words only as informing Bitcoin's broader potential, rather then whether it *is not also* an investment, then I don't need to have posted this.
*edit2*: Why did I take the narrower reading?


Bitcoin is a commodity.  When the author made this mistake, words that could have just been painting a disruptive future became instead misleading to investors.  And it is investors that are making Bitcoin into money.

The taint problem exposes a coming political era for Bitcoin, where each miner must decide what to do with a stolen coin.  It is a very dangerous transition for us, because we move from a pure consensus of clients based on packets and fees, to arguing about crime reports.  Needless to say, crime report collection, verification, and final judging are currently geographically monopolized.
Accept that taint claims will be available, for your use, if you choose; but beware any miner that would block a transaction.  
One critical factor in coin theft is information asymmetry.  The thief can mix the coins well enough before anyone knows they're gone.  Unwitting parties in transaction might bear most of the cost of any coin-blocking movements.

A deep theoretical property of money, unifying debt and bullion, which almost all current discussions haven't had the language to address, and which Bitcoin nails perfectly!
This is a great find, and thank you for the very clear presentation.
You are my newest friend.
This paper misunderstands Kocherlakota 1998's use of memory, when making the "imperfect memory" claim.  Bitcoin's memory is not imperfect from the user's perspective, or the perspective of preserving the value of the coins.
It is the user's option what identity to attach to any address.  One use case is to reuse the same address constantly, building a perfectly public reputation with it.  Another use case is trying to preserve as much privacy as possible.  Which case a Bitcoin address owner chooses depends on their technical options, as well as what forms of memory will aid the transaction, and any requirements of extended contracts.  None of this affects value.
From *"Money is Memory"*, Kocherlakota 1998:


happens if agents know only the past transfers of resources made and
received by all agents in their current match [formula 2]? It is important
to note that in the environment with memory, each individual's imaginary
balance sheet does not just depend on his own transfers; in particular, the
maker of a transfer of resources does not see an increase in his balance if
the receiver's balance was zero. For this reason, the entry on any person's
balance sheet is a function not just of his actions, but also those of his
trading partners, their trading partners, and so on. Thus, if it is to replicate
the benefits of money, memory must include the past actions of all agents
in [formula 1], not just in [formula 2].
Bitcoin perfectly contains all the information necessary to reconstruct the balance of any address, and that is exactly what the software does (clients and validating nodes), every time a transaction is created.

I think Satoshi just wanted to give early adopters the maximum incentive for it to succeed.  Money is *the most monopolized thing on the planet*.  This competes with all that, without using any guns whatsoever.  
So I wouldn't say it's "designed to concentrate wealth".  I would say Satoshi expected news to spread over a long period, and realized that *at each moment a potential participant hears about it, there needs to be an incentive to take action now*, rather than later, or everyone will let the other guy take the risk of committing to it.  I do not know if the Satoshi imagined the exchanges growing as they have.
I understand the unfairness feeling.  It's very primal.  Have you considered that almost everyone who has a lot of bitcoins is a developer who wants to nurture the new economy's startups, as an angel investor?  Do you know how much money the median angel loses?  The only thing they can think of doing with the money is making their shiny new thing better for everyone!

Good to see Jared in the action.  He gives the simplest answer possible, as if letting Bitcoin sell itself.
I cringed when he said gold was backed by something, as if he was confusing backing with physicality.  Gold has the same monetary scarcity and confidence characteristics as Bitcoin, just with a longer history.  People like Warren Buffet even ridicule gold on the same basis, obliquely joking "you can't eat it".  
The differences are: that gold has been used for taxes in the past, which is fiat  justification following consensus; and that  Bitcoin is so new that the early adopters, who understood the value and
brought that belief to the physical plane without looking to other people for guidance, are still alive to laugh at and envy.

I agree there is a certain obviousness to the memory perspective, in Bitcoin.  After all, Satoshi knew it was a requirement.  In other circles there is still lots of confusion around "intrinsic value", or the value brought to the table when banks issue debt money; they seem like different things, and this makes money seem like an arbitrary game.
Before Bitcoin, when I thought of money solutions involving functional application over distant transaction chains, my brain would report the problem as "too hard", and turn off.  That is similar, in kind, to the current limitations of most people, staring at their imperatively calculated checkbook balances.  Giving the memory concept a clear foundation helps explain what money has been all this time, and incidentally, why Bitcoin is money.

Well, offer doesn't apply to virgins.  But I can talk about it.
Every trade is a pairing of an offer, listed on the book, with a market order, entered for immediate execution.  If you want to accumulate coin, you can either list your price as a bid, or execute a market order against prices you see on the ask side.  If you bid, someone will sell to you, and your book entries will absorb price movement.  You provided liquidity.  If you execute, you consume the liquidity of asks in the book.
Since liquidity prevents price shocks, it's generally appreciated in all forms, bots included.  Fake liquidity, which consists of book orders removed when prices get close, can be more suspect.  Bots are very good at that.  Even there, it may be part of an overall strategy helpful to market liquidity.
There are many reasons to spread a 1 BTC buy over several prices, letting them sit as bids in the book.  It's well adapted for random price swings by enthusiastic sellers.
If someone does have a many-price order spread about in the book, as bids, a single large sale can execute them all.  No bot is required for that.

Along with his own physicality statement:


Mish also [quotes Hugo Salinas


These are not logical arguments.  They deserve no reply.  But,
Mish taught me about *debt-deflation*, so maybe I can help
explain a bit about a
*community-maintained-algorithmic-rival-good* in return.
 First, let's reformulate the question:
*How can a new network solve the age-old money issuance problem?  Bitcoin
miners are, after all, just __coining it__.  What, specifically,
is there to point to, in explaining why those who coin will be
restrained from assigning themselves easier rules, when supply dwindles?  Even if more distributed, aren't they
in the same position of power they have always been in?*
 Next, some background:
In Bitcoin, transactions are registered in blocks.  Before
transactions get listed in a block, they are shuffled through the
network of peers.  Miners get the right to issue themselves a
transaction of new coins for solving a block, and it is the rules
on that particular kind of transaction that limit supply.  New
blocks are shuffled around by peers in the same way transactions
are.  The original client, called the *Satoshi client*, validates
everything it sees.  This is an operation separate from the
mining itself.  Although you will commonly hear mining described
as securing the network, that's omitting something: *mining only
upvotes* transactions, and prevents reordering transactions for
double-spends; *it is validating clients that can downvote*,
securing the rules of all transactions on the network.  If a
transaction, or block of transactions, doesn't fit the rules
(that the person running the node has chosen to support), then it
is simply dropped, and not transmitted to any peers.
 So, what are the incentives?
* developers want to remain relevant
* miners want more coins, whether newly issued or as transaction fees
* owners want to keep the current issuance algorithm, validating to shun non-compliant nodes
* mobile smartphone users want simple clients (which currently do not validate locally)
* centralized merchant processors want trust, and their cut of fees
* merchants want to avoid lock-in to any single merchant processor
 What happens in case of severe disagreement?
The chain splits.  There would be more than one book of who owns what, and how it was spent.  Splits can be planned and orderly, but if disorderly, then security and value will suffer more.
 The game-theoretic equilibrium is... what? 
Owners have to be ever vigilant, and be ready to join forces as miners or larger validating nodes themselves, when necessary.  Merchants may do the same as merchant processors.  Although not yet developed, [this
shared infrastructure]( is possible.
Security payments may come due as transaction fees to approved payment processors, or owners may prefer some model that operates continuously, and feels more like
**TL;DR:** Mish is correct to want a closer look: the guarantees are not as simple as a physically-scarce thing.  But it's not just
a hollow promise of scarcity, either.  It's a rainforest of
mutually supporting incentives, keeping supply limited and transactions flowing.

Ultimately, the corporate case for doing the work to get and spread bitcoins is the same as the individual's case: it is a totally unique speculative investment, undergoing a global and well-designed monetization phase.
The question for any corporate board of directors is how agressive they are going to be about identifying the consequences of this powerful force.  If they're serious, and they think Bitcoin's growth will be serious *(which can only occur after they understand the [subjective theory of value]( network effects, and [core functions of money]( then they should reduce reinvestment at the current business's ROI, and divert cash flow to acquiring bitcoins, in accordance with the proportion they want to declare high-risk-high-reward.

Since you can't stay there anyway, what makes it special?  If you lowered prices further, and lost $N00,000 USD fast, how much would sales go up?
Your store is a fund that buys BTC using free cash flow on gadget logistics.

Think through your fund's expected return if you go long with the coins before your supplier is due.

There is no consensus because apart from the unproven transaction fee experiment (remember we're still buying hash-rate with inflationary giveaways), larger blocksize also makes miners less private, and more reliant on established data centers.  
Once a larger blocksize algorithm can be more clearly imagined and tested, the future-fee problem will get argued more rationally.  With CoinJoin's possibilities sure to get developer attention, most participants will feel they have enough privacy options.  There is probably even a privacy-friendly pooled mining option that cuts down required bandwidth a huge amount, but it hasn't been discovered yet.

Mises's Regression Theorem states that the thing must have had some value other than a medium of exchange, first.  Mises limited himself to this conclusion because he explained money's value today in terms of the memory of money's value yesterday, and risked a circular argument if not specifying a terminating condition.
The correct answer is that the network of users of a money bring the value, per Metcalfe's Law, because money's value is in arranging and completing transactions.  Once we are free from Menger's just-so story, we can rationally evaluate a money based on how we want to use it today, and expect others to do the same.  On this basis we can also think in abstractions; e.g. claiming that [Money is Memory]( and assigning further relative value to the money which most perfectly captures memory.

Slow bloat can be solved via market mechanisms (just don't increase blocksize too fast).  It could make our transaction fees sucky, like credit cards, but will never end the experiment.  There are more agrressive pruning algorithms than we're using right now.
A 51% attack is quite serious.  Some could be resolved with peering rules, again, or via a change in crypto, that resets any ASIC advantage.  The most likely long-term defense against 51% attacks is a miner army, waiting on call for higher fees.

What's the tl;dr on calling it a pyramid scheme?
@_date: 2013-02-22 05:40:23
The very short answer is **network effects**, like the reason you joined Reddit (and maybe Facebook).  It's the most important fundamental in money, because without a transaction you have nothing.  Most people look only at that, which means herd behavior.
There is something underlying, for those who think things out, and it's the reason we're not still trading seashells.  People *really* want good honest [money]( that they control.  They can **identify honest money properties** in Bitcoin, and each person brings their own vision of how to use it.
But, look back at the shackles you had to drop to see its value!  You might as well be switching religions.  
For me, recognition of Bitcoin's real value included seeing value in the network of geeks, who will stay strong through the trials to come, much like the rise of Linux.  That part is a little easier in 2013, with multiple venture capitalists, major internet sites, and actual ASIC deliveries lending credibility the network.  For many people, the early adopter payoff still looks like a ponzi scheme; rather than incentivized startup founders, who were necessary to get this kind of thing going.  Still others believe that fiat's devaluing model is absolutely necessary, to prevent deflationary spirals; despite constantly seeing banking scandals and worldwide debtor riots (Egypt is next on the riot/inflation/bailout cycle, because they can't afford their wheat imports any more).  Last but not least, all newbie Bitcoin users must find a safe technology to receive and hold the coins, and make that first transaction.
Then once it starts making sense, you have to figure out whether it might be squished!  That's a hard one.  Again, most people are incabable of doing a risk/reward calculation where the chances of total loss are as drastic as with Bitcoin.  It's an entrepreneurial mindset.
All these shackles, for all these people, have to fall off before they can go long.  Many will decide to keep paying the hidden costs of fiat.  But a significant percentage of us can see now, and more will find the way every day, for a long time.

It seems your "unenforcable" claim relies on the second part of your reply.  Otherwise, you would not believe any rule could ever work.
I believe the satoshi client is a full-validating client.  By that I mean it checks all the data it gets against all the rules.
I don't see what the issue is with forks.  If a transaction is cloned that's different from a double-spend, and it can be deduped without much processing.  Some contracts do allow updates in the memory pool, BTW.  
I believe false-transaction DoS is handled more generally, cutting off nodes that relay any non-validating spam.

Nobody has answered this correctly yet.  If you are actually using a local client, you find the wallet file (wallet.dat, for the bitcoin-qt client), and [copy it to the new installation](  Some online wallets, like [Blockchain.info]( also allow importing this file.  The wallet is the small database of your private keys.

Your technique has the advantage of working for unauthorized forks, allowing someone to verify the (hopefully small) amount of code that was changed.
Your technique does not prove your personal guarantee on any code that was delivered.  When there is a code change, people who don't read code will end up trusting that you still control your github account.  Community warnings resolve both GPG key revocation and cracked github accounts.

This episode went fine (although the Bitcoin-ID guest had jarring sound difficulties), but several comments disparaging MtGox tripped my BS detector.  Here is a list of complaints:
* MtGox did not trip the $50M clause.  That deals only in exclusivity.  CoinLab's $75M is not strongly based on any other calculation in the contract.
* Is it "Mount Gox" (it is) or M. T. Gox (it isn't).  Pick one, you damn anarchists.
* Silicon Valley Bank does not solve the MSB situation in 50 states.  CoinLab is not obviously ready to proceed in a legal manner, as required by contract.
* Mark has promised US customers (via Bitcointalk) the choice to transfer to CoinLab, or cancel their accounts.  If his heart is in the right place, his contract review skills missed allowing for that.  I hope he forces it anyway.
* Tihan Seale, CoinLab cofounder, has a rather sullied name from the Bitcoinica failure.  Whatever the cost, it may be very good to keep his hands off authentication keys.
* Other US Exchanges were shut down for obviously not following MSB and AML KYC laws.  MtGox has done an annoyingly good job of not tripping afoul of these, so far; by collecting all your personal information, and implementing fraud detection logic.  They have also been navigating banking relations (including many closures) for several years.  Their survival is not random.
* I have heard it said (on Reddit or Bitconitalk.  *edit*: Bitcointalk comment by retep, a developer, May 5th) that MtGox uses tamper-proof hardware, and that's why the transaction rate sucks.  I don't think anyone can know this for sure, but it would make sense if I was a paranoid Frenchman in Japan trying to keep servers safe in an inhospitable US legal environment.
* MtGox has not been breached in any public way since Mark scrapped Jed's code and rewrote everything.  They've even bought ripped-off customers in other jurisdictions and made them whole.  That counts for something.
* The DDoS attacks against MtGox have, at times, been very substantial.  OTOH, sometimes lag appears to have initiated purely via the order book.  Both types are serious threats coming from a determined attacker, and the entire web-facing Bitcoin ecosystem has fallen at one point or another to DDoS attacks.  The attacks against MtGox, however, are for real money (unless they're faked entirely).  I have to again give Mark the benefit of the doubt, and assume he's been working hard to adapt.  Given those trials, it's entirely possible his team has just been too busy to write good code to hand customers over; and that this was the right prioritization.
* You and I neither monitor Washington State's court system for cases filed against us, nor would we even if in that jurisdiction.  Being served process solves that problem.  There is nothing unprofessional about MtGox's hearing about the case from someone who contacted them.

MtGox has weathered several outright account closures, but this glitch forces them to retreat a bit in Japan, which was supposed to be their strongest fortress.  They may completely recover service, but this is a similar interruption in service to the exchanges that later folded, so it's confusion (fear) that you see in the price.
In order to tell if MtGox is on good terms with its Japanese bank, as they claim, watch for the throttled USD withdrawals that they said they'd be able to do.  Ask around, because if these are coming through, then it really is a manpower problem and not a regulatory problem, and MtGox will survive this.
Then that price difference is great for buying elsewhere, and selling on MtGox.

mismanagement of our central bankers (in which I include their
mechanism for hiding fiscal deficits), everybody has to speculate with their fiat,
every day; and probably for the rest of our lives.
You can see that speculation is an incredible driver for massive price appreciation; even if people are only using Bitcoin to store value, and only sell it for fiat to other speculators, when the urge to visit a store hits.

Wonderful drivel, from Statists attempting to deny that they were ever wrong!
Some claims from the article:


some of the enthusiasm for bitcoin is 
driven by a distrust of state-issued currency, it is hard to imagine a world where 
the main currency is based on an extremely complex code understood by 
only a few and controlled by even fewer, without accountability, arbitration, 
or recourse.
I assume that was not intended to be ironic.  Chicago School also delivers obligatory Hayek references, though twisted almost beyond recognition.


Hayek [endnote cites Denationalization of Money] that money should cease to be
a state monopoly and its production 
should be left to the competitive private 
sector. The linkage is misguided. Bitcoin 
is indeed free from government (so far) 
but has turned out unlike anything 
Hayek imagined. It is not issued by a 
private enterprise operating in a competitive environment, disciplined by the 
market to maintain the stable value of 
its currency. The bitcoin network is an 
automaton, issuing currency at a predictable rate, perfectly incapable of providing “good money” in Hayek’s sense, 
i.e., a currency of stable value. It has, 
moreover, a status of quasi-monopoly in 
the realm of digital currencies by virtue 
of its first-mover advantage, and Hayek 
did not address whether currency is a 
natural monopoly.
Hayek did propose that over the long run both issuers and debtors would have to agree on a currency, but one hopes he would not have confused the volatility of startup monetization with final stability, as senior economist Velde did.  Stability at equilibrium (yes, there is never equilibrium; but there is Bitcoin's post-inflation stage) comes from a static supply of currency, and is far more desirable for holders of that currency than any planning commission trying to hand money to banks to keep the price of milk stable.  That is the perpetual myth of economists (at least those in cahoots with government): that people can't be bothered to think about changes in prices, whether from shortages or productivity gains; and so they want to own something in their wallets that loses value.  One also hopes he could have recognized pure competition so strong that it upsets the imprisonment-and-death-backed fiat currency model.  
Here's a final laugh:

  viewing--I'd argue--is not truly inflation. But here I am
  deviating, because I'm preferring my own definition, I
  know. Now here, I'd say, you have prices rising, which is one
  way of measuring inflation, but not due to actual inflation,
  which I'm defining as always an increase in the quantity of
  money.
That's why I structured the discussion with these particular
single letter variables, rather than using the term
inflation. &lt;wink&gt;  We can agree about what is happening, and need
not get lost in all the ways to split a definition.


There are two sides to every trade.  The conventional view does
not differentiate between these purchasing power and value


You just said that (in our hypothetical supply shock) since money
supply didn't change, money demand didn't change.  This is wrong.
In fact, if p is rising, it is the same as saying that people are
selling their (less demanded) money for goods.




It's not in my interest to define "true inflation".  I leave it
up to you to work out how to communicate with people who are
using the word "inflation" and listening for same.

I've thought about this more.  If you're going to list your purchases and sales for credibility, you should disclose all of them, with amounts, and keep them updated.  You also have the consistent option of not talking about your finances.
I said you "sold out during the crash", and phrased it as "dumped after the pump".  I was basing it off my memory of your own earlier admissions, and made no claim that you profited by dumping early.  I certainly did not say you sold at $30.  I am technically correct in my claim: I said you dumped, and you say it was at $7.  
You tried to **reword my claim** as implying that you *caused the crash or profited from it*, and the upvotes show people either read poorly enough to have believed you, or like your politics enough not to think about what they were doing.  
Note that nowhere do I judge you for when you found it profitable or necessary to sell.  I judge you for looking fake in using your purchase decision as a badge, when you had actually flipped to sell. If you still hold some coin from that 2011 decision, great.  That can still be your badge.  But it should be described differently.

This is also the point in the article that read least true for me:




That's itself a flawed comparison, because OP is saying that tulips are fungible.  Bitcoins are even more fungible, and it's what makes them valuable as money!  It seems that OP would like to have made a statement about ultimate scarcity, but was flying at too high an explanatory altitude to hit the target clearly.
I can see why OP wants to get through the issue quickly.  But the tulip meme persists because it takes a few hours of study, using recent sources, to dig to the bottom of it.
Tulip-mania-expert Garber does mention plague.  I've also seen the contract rules of the grower's association considered primary, with the state's decision to nullify the (then new) futures contracts causing the crash.  Tulip growing is also still a huge business in Holland, and bulb breeding is much more complicated than you'd expect.
OP could instead state that it's hard for us to understand the scarcity of beautiful breeding bulbs, or the legal and banking arrangements of futures contracts at the time; but modern research suggests that when real money actually did change hands, deals were more rational than the old stories would lead us to believe.
When I'm confronted with claims of tulip mania, I tend to choose not to confront the ignorance directly, unless I have unusual amounts of time and respect for my audience.  Instead, I counter the analogy by picking a speculative rush that later proved itself - and I make it one involving some network effect.

The fundamental good being produced is private secure value storage.  You can call it savings or hoarding.
A secondary good is cheap medium of exchange.  Call it Western Union competition.
In order for value storage to work, there needs to be a large network of participants, some who will want to save when you find something you need to buy (IOW, you need an exit strategy).
Buying goods is helpful in eliminating exchange bottlenecks, if you want to spend your savings buying things that are easily available, like programmer hours worked.  But the underlying motivations of the business owners (hoard, reduce transaction cost) are how business adoption changes the price of BTC.
The underlying value limitation is governments/banks busting the exchanges.
Credit cards charge 2.5%, and bring other risks for merchants.  Bitcoin merchant payment services charge 1%.  [Global mobile payments]( is a $170B market.
Foreign remittance is a $350B market, with fees near 10%.  BTC could own 10% of that, by charging people 3% less.  Reduced cost would not go to any company's profit, but to customers.  The question is how many of them would hold coin themselves, as savings that they can use locally, perhaps as street cash; thus increasing Bitcoin's float.
What this means:
* intrinsic value grows with network participants squared
* increased float is the same as more hoarding
* early valuation metrics are based on erosion of overpriced existing services
* merchants adopt to reduce fees
* customers adopt to save, seeing merchants as distributed exit strategy
* privacy features don't drive price; although they keep international doors open and mean the network can ultimately scale larger
* speculators adopt now, because the network has a long way to grow
* price should be discounted by the percent chance that banks (via governments) declare total war.
**tl;dr:** Speculators, hoarding, network effects, street cash float, crackdown discount.
*edits:* clarified business adoption, guessed at remittance average fees

I agree that more merchants accepting Bitcoin give people more security that their coin will have value in the future.
But, there is no cure for volatility during the monetization phase.  
People are still coming in droves to explore its eventual value (even if not all decide to buy in), and their speculation cannot be eliminated by merchants flipping coin into fiat.
In your example, Joe is still making the speculator's decision to sell.  There is no cure for the decision, for everyone, at every moment.
Monetization ends when Bitcoin reaches its equlibrium with other currencies. Nobody knows what that will be, right now.

I also dissent here, mostly on "user surprise" grounds.
Curiously,  the option is not exposed in docs.  Maybe that's because it's supposed to be temporary, while some miner market mechanism is devised.  
I suspect the thorniness of the issue is gradual rollout of miner feedback.  People keeping old clients around might make this somewhat important to get in early, or the effective relay rules may get too sclerotic.  I'm actually uncertain exactly how this affects relay rules, so please correct my weasel words.

The question is how many US customers feel their data is in fact more private in Japan, and thus will opt not to accept ToS, and are finalizing their trades accordingly.
Worldwide, banks have opted to give the US data upon request, rather than be cut off from the US banking system.  MtGox has chosen a different structure, in not allowing US customers.  This is circumstantial evidence of maintaining some reasonable separation from required paperwork, that a US bank cannot opt for.  
There are other motivations for the change, such as MtGox's bad luck with foreign banks freezing their account now and then, and similar troubles I've heard of with incoming US wires.  These also suggest that MtGox is still slighly outside the certified ring of banks, and perhaps has lesser reporting requirements.
It's a curious matter to me, and I don't know exactly what the difference in reporting requirements is.  I am only explaining that there is circumstantial evidence for some difference.  
Is someone else more famialiar with foreign reporting requirements to the US, as they apply to MtGox's pseudo-bank status?

Non-protocol (kooky) sharpie changes are not a store of value because they are copyable.  Bitcoin's on-protocol ledger does accept changes from any sharpie holder, but proof-of-work limits how often.  Network effects (the value of having someone to transact with) mean there is one strongly prefered ledger, which people soon identify as a store of value.  The rest will have been future perfect.

Your bitcoins will be fine, the way Bitcoin will fork this time.  The rule transition is being carefully managed months in advance, with forward compatability built into the system several versions ahead of the split.  There probably won't be any stragglers to speak of.  It's a civil discussion, based on the merits, and everyone wants Bitcoin to succeed in the long run.
DrMandible's perfect world would leave serious double-spending issues, if the blockchain were forked.  Better to fork just the codebase, while starting a new blockchain, which can succeed or fail on its own merits.  It is important to distinguish these cases very clearly.

Actually, the [blocksize debate]( has a lot to say on this, because one way to centralize Bitcoin is to require commercial facilities to maintain a relevant peer.  
Developers are going to make a call on the new blocksize rule, and miners will make a call on whether to accept the version released, and then validating nodes will weigh in.  The Bitcoin Foundation has a lot of potential sway over developers, and lots of sway in transaction fees (especially if you include off-chain transactions).

You're definitely getting warmer.  Since a short double-spend attack would be easy to detect and block, let's imagine a sly attack.  
The mining pool delays acknowledgement of competitor blocks by 900ms.  This helps everyone in the pool a tiny amount.  Orphan block rate goes up.
The mining pool gains undue political influence in the future changes coming to mining fees.  They find some sliver of an issue that will help them remain the leading mining pool well into the future, and use their miners' votes to push it through.  Soon, mining fees increase.
The mining pool games the transaction queue to create "friend" and "foe" classes of merchants, and starts their own merchant processor as a side business.  Merchants joining the wrong processor see flaky transaction delays, and their customers tell them to switch.  But the leading (corrupt) merchant processor charges double.

I enjoyed the Nixon-era references to gold intrigue as foreign policy.

Bitcoin is made for busting through the regulatory capture necessary to keep a monopolist in power.  It takes a bit of history background to sniff out the government backing in all the worst monopolies, but you'll find it, once you start looking.
Early adopters will probably **invest** their money as angels, since there's no banking scam to keep them in power with bailouts of fractional reserve lending.  A few will take on social projects that don't need government coercion to sustain, since those are the kind of people that first realized what Bitcoin will be worth.  Sounds like **win-win**.
If you look around a productive place like Silicon Valley, those who haven't made it big aren't out to slice the throats of those supporting the next crop of entrepreneurs.  The optimism of the area spills out as positive social benefits, despite wealth disparity.  It's a totally different place than one where the wealth disparity narrative is plausibly about oppression.
Lastly, unlike the sociopaths who rise to the top of investment banks, oil companies, or defense contractors, you are dealing with *a bunch of geeks* who saw how the system works, and **solved the problem in a way that everybody can benefit from**!  And they didn't need to force anyone to do anything against their will.  Some will [bling it out a bit](but many will rise to the ethical challenge of influencing the world in a positive way.  In that lineage of wise investments, someday someone will bring an even greater gift to humanity.

This piece writes about an important connection.  It could go one step farther, and address the stranglehold on energy distribution.  
It is illegal to sell power in the US, if you are not the approved monopoly.  The history of this "natural monopoly" is rather sordid.  Selling private power might be an area ripe for civil disobedience.  
Batteries and supercapacitors need additional improvements, to route around the currently-censored grid.

* with a traditionally weak second-place position, and with no compelling differentiating features to make a strong case for Litecoin, it will shrink into obscurity  
* *then we add a nonstandard definition*: "any currency that grew from nothing, but is not going to survive forever, is a pyramid scheme, because the early adopters profit more than those stuck holding at the end, which is the profit pattern in a pyramid scheme".

I don't know of anything beyond the [contingency plans](
but we can think it through.  
If the objective is responding to a bug, then the procedure will move everyone, and look like the issue a few weeks ago.  Alerts and coordination will prevent transactions on the old fork.
If the objective is a warring Newchain, then one possible split will honor old Bitcoin balances before a genesis date, though being powerless to prevent double spending on the original Bitcoin chain.  So far, all new chains have had objectives opposing this.  Newchain could further state that it will merge at later points in time, too.  It could rollback all detected cross-chain doublespends.  It could respect irreversible destruction of Bitcoins, when they are declared in favor of Newchain (and this would make all other bitcoins stronger - a nonviolent "drop-out" option).  This would all be very costly for Newchain's perceived fairness, but might dilute the incentive for individual Bitcoin stakeholders to fight it.
One might think, at first, that this is dangerous information, and threatens Bitcoin.  But if one's incentives are aligned with one's balance, then the point is that blockchain technology can evolve however it needs to, and buying in now (to the Bitcoin blockchain) might not be punished, even if Bitcoin is made obsolete.  *Knowing of possible Newchain offspring, that respect one's balance, may strengthen the current Bitcoin adoption rate*.  
There is the larger question of whether schism destroys value, and how Bitcoiners would come to evaluate, and defend against, that risk.

If you consider that the role of a central bank is to be the lender of last resort, and that central banks cannot issue Bitcoin, and thus cannot bail out any subsidiary banks in their fiat infrastructure who get ruined while dabbling in Bitcoin, then their "do not touch" directive is perfectly reasonable.  Keep in mind that there is a giant shadow banking system in China, built to serve the needs of people that the regulated banking system will not serve.  I'm not worried at all about this stifling innovation in China.

Every few generations there is an event that exposes rehypothecation.  These events will be very clear in the Bitcoin world, because there will be very little risk to holding bitcoins yourself, once the software development has settled a bit.

You have to trust SSL certificates.
It might be possible to use message signing, with vanity addresses, to verify identity.  The vanity addresses would be static, but the escrow transaction itself can use any other addresses needed.
* merchant **signs message using vanity address**, with escrow transaction instructions and URL
* client checks merchant message
* new merchant (and escrow agent) vanity addresses are stored in a **"Trust on First Use"** client database
* when a new address is found, a modal address confirmation dialog displays: the address, and a human-memorable unique image, generated from the address
* client follows URL to escrow agent
* escrow agent signs message with escrow transaction instructions 
* client checks escrow agent message, using same TOFU principles
* client proceeds with escrow instructions
* major merchant (and escrow agent) vanity addresses are built into client

The Economist [just wrote an article]( on volatility.  As an economist yourself, I'm sure you've read it.

I'd call it about two dozen, with three that matter.  They will share (probably distributed along a power law) several more orders of magnitude of value than we see in Bitcoin's network now.
**tl;dr:** Bitcoin proves itself valuable now, as a volatile speculative saving instrument, while it gets big.  It only stabilizes in a merchant-friendly way when it's already *very big*.  That could involve all money-using Earthlings accepting its value, and knowing how to access it, using the nearest smartphone interface.

Something about silver is accessible enough to be used in coinage, in denominations that matter to people.   They have a history evaluating and working with it, and there's an industry that can assay it.  People can hold it, think loosely about prices in silver, and know they'll be able to use it.
If silver was only owned as a number in an account, and if platinum were as easy to hold (removing any relative difference in mitigating counterparty risk), then your issues would be the more important ones.
Lastly, platinum is used as a catalyst in making nitric acid, for fertilizers.  It soaks up hydrogen atoms as required, then releases them.  [Most of the platinum sticks around](  Current processes lose about [44 milligrams of platinum per ton of nitric acid produced [pdf from 1999]](  I'm not sure how many tons of platinum industry loses in total, but I'm sure it's priced in properly.

I [wrote about this back at $30](Bitcoin's value can keep going up because it is driven by network effects, and the potential network is vast.
There is friction against network adoption.  The most important is changing one's mind about what money is.  Trusting the technology to scale (which means how the supernode problem gets solved) is also a major factor.  There are others, too, described in the above link.

Thanks.  I agree that price is a matter of supply and demand, and that recent good news is also a factor.  I might be totally wrong here.  I can improve my argument.
* Higher difficulty has made a temporary shift to more serious miners. 
* Self-selection means only the most long-term optimistic miners are investing so much time and personal energy into Bitcoin, so their tendency to hold makes sense.
* Stated as inverse: small miners, who are now less competitive, were more likely to sell, but now cannot.
* Non-miner large investors move the price when they cannot competitively mine.  Their mine-or-buy math says buy.  It is easy for their buying to occur over a much shorter period of time than a mining investment would, especially in a market with a long-term upward trend.
* If large investors had mined, due to a difficulty they could conquer, they would reduce small-miner supply, but the effect would be more spread out over time.
* Small investors move the price as a group, but they were already less likely to get into mining.
I overspoke using words like "can only be explained by".  I can only explore whether  there is a feedback mechanism here, not the relative weights of factors.  I think there is a feedback mechanism.

Skipjack was an attempt to control technology at the point of manufacture, but attempts to make all alternatives illegal munitions eventually failed (PGP).  In the current US police state, you have to check in before exchanging money, or you are a criminal.  
It is not that US regulators, military spies, and incumbant banksters are directly trying to control Bitcoin.  It is that they want to deny Americans the use of interesting money technology, when used without registration.  And they have no choice: they must do this, to tax it enough to make it less competitive than fiat dollars, for most people.  If they fail, dollar dominance wanes earlier than their expectations for a manageably declining empire.  Americans actually lost the war for monetary freedom long ago: once in 1862, and again in 1913, when they allowed the State to define an interest in their labors, rather than the mere things around them; such as titled holdings, or goods passing through customs.
Criminal consequences, and over a hundred years of precedent, are two reasons why the State will attempt to keep fighting.
They don't care about unleashing human potential, while adapting taxation to a future of titled assets, or quantifying the actual costs in loss of privacy for the feeling of "security".  They only care about a few extra years of fat for their profits and pensions; a horizon on which the war on any money friendly to privacy (thus offering a hope of anonymity) looks sustainable.  Call it soverign moral hazard. That is why I think they will keep applying force to AML, KYC, and MSB regulations, this time around.  Every interrupted exchange between individuals who choose not to submit to centralized registration is a success justifying more State control, no matter who gets hurt.  
VC-funded companies will throw customers' privacy under the bus at a predictable rate, too - they aren't allies with privacy, whether or not their fees are lower than traditional fiat banking fees.
**TL;DR:** They don't have to stop the tech, as long as they get their spying done.  NSA-versus-you looked very different in 1996.  This time your incorrect (unregistered) use of tech can land you in jail (especially if in the US), and the cultural expectations for their monetary control mechanisms have been baking for over a hundred years.

Incorrect.  There is a feedback loop, as articulates.  
New investors have the choice to become miners; so they take difficulty estimates into account, for an alternative price on the coins they would buy.  If they want bitcoins, and see that they would have to pay X to mine them, then any purchase price for less than X is worth considering.
I went through this decision.  I know it is part of a rational investor's calculation.
It is true that the feedback loop between difficulty and price is not of the kind we'd call directly causal.  But both are part of the chaotic ecosystem of incentives that makes Bitcoin the miracle it is.

Thank you OP, for this clear description of what I call "*the
monetization event*".  I take your point to be describing how
monetization can be incredibly rapid, and have these
characteristics, without putting additional pressure on
"management".  
Adoption work is distributed to each person, at the moment of  changing their
mind (and their software) to accept the new money, and
process transactions.  Bitcoin can still be overbought,
creating swings in price, but it is not the same as a stock's
management missing earnings expectations, showing some
paradigm failure.
Eventually progress on the [adoption curve]( will slow down, and the froth on the price will invert for a while, but that is still a long way from here.

This is a useful effort.
Under fiat currency, backed by debt, when asset prices collapse then loans fail and thus money is erased.  
On the far right, instead of using the phrase "the bad kind" you could instead say: "Monetary deflation (less velocity of money per person) reduces lending.  It also discourages weak investments, and luxury spending.  Bitcoin's monetary base is not dependent on lending."  The implication is that Bitcoin's economy need not have the same lending-instabilities as current fiat economies.  I think this suggests splitting the right side.  You might also point out that fiat is likely to maintain its excellence as a currency to lend in, alongside Bitcoin. 
[Steve Keen]( is perhaps the most vocal educator on debt deflation.
On the far left, you could point out that all saving is investment in the economy's future, delayed to account for life's uncertainties, but available for investments judged appropriate.

Yes.  If you are interested in the long term value of your
bitcoins, you should be *very* interested in [taint](
Whether or not you eventually submit to taints affecting the value
of your coins, you will likely have software available [to see
those taints](
The worst case is they are used in mandated blacklists, and all
the big exchange houses are regulated closely enough to block coins
based on the list.  You may have done nothing wrong, yet been
handed "hot coins", which are now mostly worthless.  Maybe you
even get detained and questioned.  Maybe they break down your
door in that process.  Your only defense is to check the
blacklist yourself, before accepting the coins: **the blacklist is very viral**.  Since
governments play other tricks too, the value of all bitcoins
would fall, in correspondence with the fluctuating corruption index of
powerful governments.  It does not even matter if you think your government is great; you do not want your global cryptocurrency's [network value]( suddenly sharded per legal realm.
[Mike Hearn
proposes (to loud boos both on Reddit and Bitcointalk)](people maintain their own taint lists, using their own moral reasoning, because nobody wants
violent criminals to succeed.  The argument against is mostly "give government an inch, and they'll take you a mile".   Also, once you lose total fungibility, a whole variety of payment
scenarios become impossible.  Our points out that coins will [almost always be laundered before they are ruled tainted](  And how is anyone going to track
their feelings about all the latest criminalization movements, anyway?  To Mike's credit, the issue has a ring of inevitability, and must be discussed.
The most robust solution: let anyone taint coins, but just
have so little monetary interaction with forceful government
entities that nobody is worried about accepting coins tainted with
consensual maybe-crime, such as we find over in Most owners do
not think of Bitcoin's growing tendrils of influence as needing to constantly steer around government, at present.  There is great hope that all will be forgiven.
**tl;dr:** Privacy was not a robust solution to bad laws.  We
  really have to fix our governments.
