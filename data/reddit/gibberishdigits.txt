Hey look, elitist peasant is bragging about his sudden luck.
If fees will be high, you will participate in an economy of  wealthy duches, like yourself, which are very few. If poor people will not be able to use currency, they will not work for this currency. Good luck using your wealth in an economy, where nobody needs your money and everyone needs something to buy.

then reach out to your team with a message, that their credibility as journalists is at stake. There was never a controversy. There was just another loud impostor, that does not have the private keys to prove his claims. There are lots of Napoleons and Hitlers in mental hospitals. hope your team does not make to many documentaries about them.

It'll be winter for the whole norther hemisphere. US inauguration will be like... in December 2020 or so?
Your country prints world money out of thin air and can pay for most sophisticated intelligence and military force on the planet, remember? Do you actually believe Putin has power to elect someone for US? Keep blaming Russia and personally Putin. It's much easier to live with that, then admit that someone in your country will do whatever it takes to get to power, even if it will push US to the brink of a civil war. Neither Trump nor Hillary nor any other elderly puppet decide shit in the US.

Putin will be the last one, who makes up his mind.
It's his game: one step forward two steps back. Expect things to go down with stakes being doubled every turn, so it seems like it's still okay. At the end it will seem like he is ready to assign bitcoin as a new national currency, but then it will be outlawed. He already started to crank up on VPN, encryption and all that. Crypto is one of his sparring partners now.
As s Russian, i like Putin. He understands people's weakness and masterfully uses them in politics for Russia's benefit. Tech and math does not have weak points. I hope, he will loose this one.

VPN ban will be inefficiently enforced in Russia. So no, he will not.
@_date: 2017-07-31 09:57:29
they can. 
business vpn are allowed.
actually, all vpn are allowed. they will only ban those, that widely used to access banned web sites. they are trying to battle priacy, actually. but they will loose.

That's called a brigand. 
"trade deficit"? You pay US dollars for real tangible goods and labor overseas. Those dollars - are just variable values in a FED database, incremented by Yellen (and without any audit). The minute you decline to sell your oil with dollars - you will have F16 bombing your home to make an example out of you or riots to put a puppet govt in your country, that will accept a generous offer of "FED IOU". This is how you borrowed goods for 20 trillion dollars.
@_date: 2017-07-29 17:08:56
yea, sure. the verge will explain you the truth

Oh, honey... US does not protect "free trade". Your tax dollars are a mere droplet in the sea of trillions of dollars made out of thin air to fund american military industrial complex. US borrows goods from other countries to build bombs to threaten those countries with, while  "borrowing" new goods (to build new bombs). Free trade does not need "protection". US fucked this word in all it's holes.

Most film and traditional media content creators in russia are arrogant and not very smart, but they have connections in places of power. Govt subsidies programs to develop film and culture. Those corrupt guys get the money, shoot some shitty stuff and then they blame piracy for not being successful in competing with US and Canada production. If you look deeper into this law, it starts to make sense, unless they will enforce it too much.

If your country has a US military base, you are occupied. And they will use this base to bomb the shit out of anyone, who proposes to stop being an "ally" to US. So, it's kind of not an option. For like 70 years not an option.
