A lot of the Bitcoin videos lack a simple way of explaining the technical side of bitcoin. More specifically a way of explaining how bitcoin and the blockchain are not just a currency but a platform for innovation. 
Too many videos focus on the price and economic aspects of it. I think the technical and political aspects are the most interesting. 
One of the most important questions that isn't often asked is... What is money? You could discuss how you think bitcoin may or may not fit into a scholarly concept of what is money. 
Just some random ideas.

100's? There's talk that BFL has over 50,000 orders right now. 
Will it be profitable? I'm not a wizard and nor is anyone else. I have no idea if it will be a profitable play or not. If profit is your goal, you be just as well off putting that $2,500 on black.
That being said, do not get into mining if you're only interested in profit. Get into mining because you want to support and idea. I mine because I think central banks are a plague on society and I am willing to devote my hard earned money to fight for the cause.

Avalon says they're ready to manufacture in mass. BFL is beginning to manufacture in mass. Wait a month or so and pick the company that does it better or more profitably. 
If you preorder with BFL, expect around 6 months shipping time from now. Avalon I'm not sure about. I'm sure they will announce a new batch soon. 
As far as new companies. I like terrahash (base their miners on Avalon chips). I think Kcnminer is not going to hit anywhere near their shipping target so I would avoid them.  We will probably see a company with BFL chips soon. 
TLDR: wait 
@_date: 2013-05-28 08:40:54
Does anyone know why?
@_date: 2013-06-13 04:08:59
They almost have a monopoly on the ASIC game, minus a few Avalon and BFL machines. They produce chips based on older technology than either Avalon or BFL and competition is only getting hotter. Don't expect this dividend to last. This stock is structured very much like a Ponzi scheme.

I'd say not that low, but I expect the price to go lower. I'm waiting for $100 to buy, and I'll buy more if it hits $70, $50 and any lower. Small chunks each time.
I feel like most people don't have the stomach for these price swings and will cash out. I'm planning on capitalizing on that. The media will stop talking about bitcoin and the price will adjust to a reasonable level. However, keep in mind that Bitcoin's value is based on speculation and we will likely continue to see wild price swings.

Those Nvidia Tesla cards are beastly but heads-up probably can't even beat a 7970 at mining. 
@_date: 2013-06-26 04:13:19
Take a real example: ASICminer. They were able to produce more ASIC devices more quickly than any other company. So much so that they could have pulled a 51% attack on the network if they kept all of their ASICs. However a 51% attack would be so hugely detrimental to bitcoins value that the bitcoin they mined would be worth very little so they sold some of their ASICs to customers and kept some to mine for themselves. 
Another reason. ROI is phenomenal if you get in early and miserable if you get in late. Avalon mines on their customers hardware before shipping because of this. However, down the line after a lot of ASICs are in the wild mining, the real profit will be in selling because ROI will be approaching never. If you can get in new technologies early, do so because that's where the money is at. 
Another reason: it costs a lot of money to start an ASIC company and preorders are an easy way to generate that capital. 
@_date: 2013-08-28 21:41:35
First off, this has to be the least relevant thing I've ever seen posted in the subreddit.

@_date: 2013-11-04 18:49:43
This has been known as a vulnerability of the system for a very long time. It also goes by the name "50% Attack". This research is by no means groundbreaking. 
One thing you have to realize is that it is very unlikely to ever occur because the bitcoin that could be potential gained would be massively offset by lost of trust in the system. Bitcoin would massively crash if someone could acquire enough hardware to perform this kind of attack because people would lose trust in the system. Not to mention only a large country like China or the US would have the resources to pull it off. It would cost millions if not billions of dollars. Maybe a mining pool operator could go rouge but I doubt it. Slush and Eligus have shown they are very trustworthy. 
@_date: 2013-07-28 01:24:40

I think friedcat needs 15btc/block in fees for Asicminer dividend (and also stock price) to not tank. Lots of ASICs are about to be hitting the market and this valuation is not sustainable. If Asicminer is putting 70% of its stock price in hardware, what happens when the price tanks? Do they sell off hardware? I find the lack of regulation and transparency alarming.

I think the important issue here is your situation. Do you have a wife and do you have children? What other financial obligations are you under?
The best advice is don't invest any money you can't afford to lose. So can you afford to lose that $50k? Wallets get stollen or the price could crash. You have to have a very high tolerance for risk to make that move.
I personally have about 25% of my savings in bitcoin. I am 24 without a wife or children and consider my risk tolerance to be extremely high. My mom (who is a financial advisor) thinks I am insane. I think it's a calculated risk.
Ultimately it's your money and it sounds like you already made your mind. Best of luck to you. I admire you making such a brazen move.

Ripple seems to me to be a ponzi scheme. I'm not saying it won't be successful, but it is the antithesis of bitcoin and I will not be supporting it.

So mining can be unprofitable in two senses:
1. Mining can't beat the cost of hardware before the hardware become obsolete
2. Mining costs more than the cost of electricity
 is a persistent risk that all miners face because the price of bitcoin in the future is impossible to predict. Fundamentally, mining is gambling and most miners realize this. 
Now  is already a reality for CPU miners, and I believe it will become a reality for GPU miners in about a year once the market becomes saturated with ASIC miners. The thing is, people will take their miners off of the market if they can't beat the price of electricity and the difficulty will go down. The market will correct itself so that it will be profitable. Considering the efficiency of ASIC miners, it will be a very long time before this happens. Everyone taking their miners off the the market simultaneously will never happen because difficulty will decrease and at a certain tipping point it will become profitable again. Not to mention that some people mine for ideological reasons and not profit.
TLDR: Mining is risky and profitability is impossible to predict.

Don't compare BFL to KNC. 
BFL has working products, KNC does not.
KNC has yet to demonstrate that they have operational chips yet. It is very risky to purchase a miner from them and I think it is unlikely they will ship on time.
BFL on the other hand is run by idiots. They insult customers, are terrible at communicating and lie about shipping dates. I have been waiting on a preorder for 6 months. Don't buy from them, they will go out of business as they deserve. 
Another company, Avalon, is also having serious issues shipping. 
So where do you get ASICs? ASICminer. 
I sell block erupter USB sticks. I am sold out right now but will receive my next shipment in a week. $50 paypal per 334 mh/sec miner or .45 btc. Free shipping to anywhere in the US. I will have a shit load in stock the 19th or 20th and ship fast. 
I'm also going to retail the new blades. They come out in a week or two. Let me know if you are interested. 
ASICminer always ships on time.

Current profit is more like .006 BTC per block erupter per day. Plan on 1-2 years for ROI.

Since you're young, you have a very high tolerance for risk. Only invest money that you can afford to lose. I see no problem with your strategy. 
I only invest around 20% of my net worth in bitcoins but that stake will probably be growing over the next couples months. 
I feel like why not let it ride. Investing in bitcoins is way more fun that the stock market.

First off what Mac can draw a 500w? None of them except for a Mac Pro at load. MacBooks idle around 10W and iMacs probably don't idle at much more than that. 500W no way.
I feel like most people that recommend RBPs for mining have never mined with a RBP.

Good for the price of Bitcoin. Bad for the world. Very bad for the world. 
However, don't plan on it happening. The media is freaking people out about it to get ratings. Politicians know how bad it would be and won't let it happen. 
@_date: 2013-11-02 17:04:33
Um... you need to consider rise in difficulty. Difficulty is rising much faster than price and therefore you are fucked good sir.

In the last 3 months the difficulty has quadrupled. Assuming that continues, which I think it will be even more extreme, ROI is one year (use an online calculator, default difficulty estimation is a joke). When BFL is shipping 500 units a day difficult is going to go through the roof. That ROI assumes 100% uptime, doesn't count electricity or computer electricity and also assumes it doesn't break. Good luck. 
Like you said, it has tremendous novel value. I own one myself but am not expecting a profit.

Gox doesn't give a shit about the price of bitcoin, in fact the more volatility the better for them because they can collect more fees. Plain and simple reason they don't stop this nonsense.

Paypal is interested in bitcoin precisely because it encroaches on their business model. They will slowly realize they need to co-opt bitcoin or go out of business. Faced with that reality they most certainly will start supporting bitcoin transactions. Threyy will most likely create a technology that competes with buttercoin.
