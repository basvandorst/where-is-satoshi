Very true! Would much prefer paying for my rigs in bitcoin. New egg would be stupid not to jump on the bitcoin train.

Btw that same former vp, who has serious connections in silicon valley and major companies , told me to invest as much as possible into bitcoin before it becomes commercialized and widely accepted of course. Says that huge corporations are already investing big and considering bitcoin as a viable form of payment

Imagine the FBI is doing this to increase the value of bitcoin. I mean they do control a pretty nice amount of bitcoin after the sr takedown

Great explanation of bitcoin. Still reading.... so far seems really amazing. What course is this for?

My best friend used to be the vp of ecommerce a few years ago at amazon. If only he didn't get an executive position elsewhere.... I would have had the power to single handedly convince amazon to accept the coin and increase the demand for bitcoin even greater

Could this pose a threat to the stability and value of bitcoin and the situation going on with the Chinese next week?

Wait until the end of the month when the NY hearings are over. Federal law surrounding bitcoin may face a change very soon.
