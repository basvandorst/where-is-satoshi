Can I get in too? I've wanted to subscribe but the cost against how much my portfolio is worth is prohibitive.

What are the right reasons? Let the guy have his car.

What is the best website for charting cryptocurrency? I'm new but I want to start understanding trends. Any pointers for learning material like videos would be very welcome too.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:14:47
Awesome, thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:55:44
I'm on data. Can't read your comment.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:20:38
Thanks. I wonder what we might predict is the current number of people involved. Maybe in the low hundreds of thousands?

Any recommendations on research resources?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:47:57
Is there a higher quality sub or chat? I'm shocked at the quality of the questions. I'm new myself but people don't seem to understand even basic stuff.

Speculating. Just like you are. The price could half by next month, then triple in a year because of multiple factors beyond our control and comprehension. Oops I mean HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:29:52
Perfect. Thanks!

I think you don't understand pump and dump.

Any suggestions on a good wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:44:54
Thank you for your insight. Good to hear a careful approach in these heady times.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:51:36
Who knows. Why ask?
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:12:27
Should work now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:19:37
Why would you wait for a higher price? Is this /s?
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:02:09
Interesting. I figure that the average person who will massively profit from bitcoin falls into one of two camps:
1) bought a small amount at a low price, early 
2) bought at a high price but invested more (took more risk)
It's too late (arguably) for 1) and not many people I know are willing to do 2). This means bitcoin will only change the lives of pioneers and risk takers.

If you believe in it. HODL. So what your entrance was badly timed, it's if your exit is badly timed too that you really fuck it up.

I would sell at least your original $1000 but take some profits out too. Then I would split half of that into cash and half into altcoins. My opinion. Congrats on your fortune.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:05:45
Attach a bank account?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:58:24
Would that put it at roughly $170k per coin? (17k x 10)

I have two questions for knowledgeable folk. Firstly, how many people currently own bitcoin? Is there a way to find out or a way to come up with a rough figure? And related, I know only 11 million can own 1 full bitcoin, but is there a maximum number that can own a fraction?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:17:20
Yes. It will increase your limit. Go to your accounts and look for your currency. I assume USD? Then deposit using payment method and add a bank account.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:37:46
You can buy gift cards which allows them to open their own account.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:52:50
Didn't realise there was one. I'll check.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:22:39
Why would anyone give you $2900 in three days for nothing. Are you serious?
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:47:54
Do you know how long it takes to transfer from a bank account? Just deposited 100 and hoping I've done it right but it says it could take 2 business days.

Also Twitter username. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:52:21
Can you store any other coins on nano? How does Trezor compare?
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:39:33
Fair play. I'm maxing my limit so needed to link my account lol 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:08:59
Looks like it: 
No worries though just pick another exchange and trade from that instead.
