Message me by the end of the day (USA, 10PM EST), I'll make you a bot.

Now, RPi (or any unix based machine) is the hardest to use, mostly because even if they do, you can't just send a keystroke. So I am going to make the arcade cabinet with a RPi and an old windows machine I picked up for $18 and see if I can make one or the other send keystrokes. Probably going to wire the RPi to a keyboard to hit the start button on the windows machine.
Using retro arch, this isn't too difficult, just a little pricey for me to set up :/
EDIT: Simulated keystrokes I mean. UNIX doesn't seems to be too friendly with those.

BitCoin. It's a digital coin. Two words combined. They are thinking of calling 100 Satoshis, a Bit. A BitCoin is a valid term.

Recycling phones to make BitCoin wallets would be interesting and great.
But Raspberry Pi can emit radio signals, proven by the Pirate Radio project Radio Shack presented.
Now if I were to come up with a long term solution, I'd make keychain FOBs with a key linked to an online wallet. Much like PayPals solution at stores.
This would eliminate the credit card issue, unless we wanted on of those too. Different companies can control different cards, much like Visa or MasterCard.
Whatever works I guess, I just don't think a hardware wallet from china is going to be widely accepted.

If someone can get me there, I can bring 5-10 Verizon 4G Jetpacks to host wifi. They have great signal almost anywhere and are really fast. 
Each can handle roughly 5-15 people, depending on how heavy the use is.

On your first statement,




Yes, it would crash the price. As far as everyone knows, those coins were burned. Burning means no one can touch them. This also mean, the "supply" of bitcoin is reduced 10% of the overall, and since right now our market is Supply vs Demand, that could drop us like a rock. Imagine billions of dollars worth just somehow enter the market out of a burn address and that wallet is found active... That means it dilutes the price quite a bit.
@_date: 2014-05-05 15:21:50
I make things easy for people to understand. BitCoin. You notice "coin" in there, correct? What do you rekate that to? Money.
If a new, grandma level, computer user wants to join Bitcoin, they want to relate it to things they know, rather than learn new concepts.
Now, if one were to say Bitcoin, you take it as a name. You still see "coin" in the name, but it is presented as a new concept.
You want new users to slowly learn. I am no Bitcoin expert, but I did study public relations and have been using Bitcoin and DogeCoin long enough to help new users. If you look at my original tutorial on DogeCoin, and see all the new user's comments, you can see how easy it was for them, and how it made an impact to just be simple. I related to things they knew.
@_date: 2014-04-08 23:37:36
The password was 50 characters long. I just generated two wallet addresses and plopped them on top of each other. It gives me errors occasionally because of the length though.
I don't know too much about SSL or web security in general, but I've been using VPN through my computer without issues. I'm assuming this is bad as well? I'll look into SSL and maybe getting rid of the VPN.
I'll be sure to do that. Do I need to update the BlockChain everytime I upgrade the BTCD?
@_date: 2014-08-17 22:35:58
Scam coins? Only Doge and BTC are supported.

iPhone 4, push either doesn't work or delays by an hour. I do really need a phone with a working push feature, but I can't upgrade without losing my unlimited plan. So I'm a little stuck, since I need unlimited.

They probably didn't submit on GitHub, which is where they check for changes.
@_date: 2014-04-08 23:51:02
Yeah I trashed the addresses, plus they were blank PotCoin addresses, which I don't use. I never really thought of just making a generator, I guess I was/am just lazy.
My app isn't public quite yet, so for right now I'll stay with VPN. Once it goes Open Source I'll have to change to SSL of course.
Awesome, I don't know how large the blockchain is, but I do not want to have to do it twice or more.
Thanks for your help :)

One that would receive a frequency with amount needed, take the stored coins, partition a certain amount, and pass the key back to the receiver. 
These wouldn't be expensive, actually the hardest and most expensive part would be distribution and design.
@_date: 2014-05-06 00:53:30
That's called a pump and dump scheme.
Though, as a DogeCoin and BitCoin user, neither is traded for the other. I like both coins.
Some people do do this, but BitCoin isn't the primary currency. That's like asking:
"Isn't printing Bitcoin the same as printing USD? Since the coins get cashed out anyway?"

I do! I actually am planning on setting up shop with a retro video game store.
Quite honestly I think we should embrace all of it as an open market, and dilute the illegal stuff. At least then people won't be afraid to try something out or people won't link this directly to bitcoin in a 100% negative way.

Speaking of NES aswell, I have an [NES right here that can uses DogeCoin as payment (to hit the start button in a MAME emu and soon to be others). I am really trying to get bitcoin to work also. It would be cool to have an arcade machine that you can pay with BTC. I'm only using it for the MAME emulator though.](
It's a modified version of RetroPie and the wallet server running on a laptop on the same wifi.
I want to try to get this into a handmade cabinet instead of just an NES case.
***EDIT: I used DogeCoin because it was just easier at the time to send whole numbers (i.e. 440 Doge ($0.25)). But I am going to put BTC on there.***

I went to the waterpark today actually, which is a good example of my work day.
I had to pack two rechargeable batteries for my phone, because I cannot let it die. I did use both.
Basically, I am just hitting the refresh button on my browser and mail app all day. While I drove there, I refreshed my phone. So while I waited in line, I refreshed. As soon as I finished one ride, I refreshed. When I walked from one ride to another, I refreshed. While I'm driving home, I refreshed. 
The constant checking ruins quite a bit of my trips.
And also, I got zero emails today. So it sucked. And that's pretty much my day.

No, I completely understand, I was just joking. Having to line your walls with bills shows just how much he had to hide. And how much he gained illegally.
And you can't just launder it, I'm sure he bought things illegally with it too, since he can't really spend it without raising any flags.
So yeah, I see your point, and how illagal that is. If it was just one Bitcoin, there would be a lot of news covering it.

At least you can hold the BitCoin on an Android phone. No one would know!
But in all seriousness, I also see your point, USD is used more for drugs than any other currency.

Ah good, someone to ask about BitCoinD.
I'm well into iOS development and made a mobile wallet on my iPhone (I can't get an android, Verizon will take my unlimited plan from me) with DogeCoinD.
Are the commands just ported from BitCoin? I guess what I'm asking is, can I just run BitCoinD and connect to it the same way with the same commands? I haven't found anything on google that was useful, they direct me back to LiteCoin.

It's open source, so yes. Just host it yourself :P
But I do plan, even as a developer for the main project, to fork it for my own features. I would also like to see direct deposit. Unfortunatly, unless you are hosting yourself, it cannot instantly comfirm payments. So it would need to be a forwarder of sorts.

It's just a saying, meaning DogeCoin want's to have it's own value. How much is a dollar? It's a dollar, you don't compare it to gold (not directly anyway) and you don't compare it to Euros.
A cup of coffee is NOT $2, it is 0.004135BTC, but you are so used to comparing it to your native currency BECAUSE they don't accept BTC.
If you wanted to buy a coffee at some BitCoin exclusive shop, it would be priced at 0.004135BTC, not $2
You are NOT comparing it to other currencies, you're comparing it to the good you buy with it. The value stands at 1 BTC = 1BTC

*My local Dollar General is a PayPal retailer, and I could potentially buy non-food groceries from there with BTC soon. And my extra money goes to the only Radio Shack near me with DIY stuff on their shelves, and accepts PayPal.

On the bright side, I bought BTC yesterday and I am up 12%, so I got that going for me, which is nice.
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:15:38
You got me, but I have more BTC than you, SO HA. ***cries a lot***
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:11:34
I have no idea what that is but I'm sure there can google can help.
@_date: 2014-10-16 22:36:43
Landon had nothing do with this, please do not rip him. Landon had no idea.

Is this in South Carolina? Because if so, I can locally get behind this.
I'm at work so I can't research really, but if it's near Columbia, I gotchu.

So, what part of the pyramid would you like to start on?
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:16:22
Briliant. I can do this in the center of my ABORTIONS4BTC building.
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:38:58
That would be awesome, I definitely will look into this after work
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:14:47
- Not bad, need donations
- Hell yes, it's legal as long as I state is educational and an exaple of what a ponzi scheme is and how to avoid them, while letting you play a ponzi game.
- So, like, day trading for fun with other people's money? Totally can do that!

The original title was supposed to read: If the price goes back up to $250 OR goes down to $99 in the next *24* hours, I will take a picture of my dick and create a company centered around it. Somehow.

I'm in favour of your ideas. Literally. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 23:31:30
Hoping this gets to 
@_date: 2015-01-05 14:51:10
Gox 3.0, there was still MintPal
@_date: 2015-05-13 14:08:24
I'm emailing them now explaining the situation. I hope this can be resolved.
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:10:42
Already done actually, I broke the store so it's down at the moment, but you can buy retro video games and consoles from me for Dogecoin.

You've been banned from the future establishment.
@_date: 2015-01-04 13:48:57
Then do you mind buying all the coins you see? Thanks
@_date: 2015-01-14 23:32:11
Sorry, I saw Redskins somewhere in here. So go fund yourself.
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:20:08
Oh god, you better donate the shit out of that if I do.
@_date: 2015-01-16 19:02:22
And then lose all your coins and buy cheap. Rinse, repeat.
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:09:59
Maybe invest in Ripple as a backup?

A lot of girls are on there just to see if anyone thinks they're cute. It's not you, it's your area.

This will prove difficult, but not impossible.

You can probably liquidate those Magic cards on MTGox.com, wait a second...
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:35:42
That would be immoral. Luckily I don't care and will be proud of my small Bits.
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:07:41
I like your username, that is enough of a requirement for me, you're hired.

It's not a product if it is crowd funded by Make it a Reddit advertisement paid for in Bitcoin, like Doge did, except theirs was to show off the funny Doge and what it can do.
It was just funded by a cool currency, by a community on Reddit. That still gets users.
@_date: 2015-05-13 14:07:40
Both transactions are mine :/ I'll submit an issue and send an email.
@_date: 2014-06-18 03:16:42
I feel like if "dogecoin" was replaced with "Bitcoin," and "Bitcoin" was replaced with "USD" in your opinion there, a lot of people would be upset.
It's very hypocrytical of you to say that. I am trying to make myself simply spoken when I say, I use Doge only. I used to use Bitcoin, and I love what Bitcoin is, but I decided to move, just like you did when you made the jump to Bitcoin. I'm not in it for the community, I honestly feel as though Dogecoin has a chance.
No, I'm not part of the majority of users who only owns 50 bits worth, I am actually putting money into it. You are only judging the coin by the bottom percent users.
@_date: 2015-05-13 14:03:38
If I changed to my own then it would work, but it's not my address.
@_date: 2014-04-22 18:55:14
I'll start picking mine then...
@_date: 2015-04-21 21:31:09
"All the users"
I'm certainly not, that can't be "all." Bitcoin is popular in the Linux/Unix scene, as it appeals to tech users. It is definitely better where it is. Windows just sucks to work with when making this type of thing.
@_date: 2015-04-21 22:44:03
Shit, you are correct, I have lighthouse on the mind, but I did mean OpenBazaar. Thank you.
@_date: 2015-04-20 10:46:45
Why upvote him? When the difficulty readjusts, it will be much faster. It just doesn't shift quickly
@_date: 2015-04-21 21:41:43
Bitcoin is different, it was made in mostly the same language, and written to work across all platforms.
OpenBazaar is written in multiple languages and does not always work across platforms.
A lot of the world uses a Unix. Not all, but a lot.
@_date: 2015-03-25 02:06:02


God dammit, you are adorable
@_date: 2015-03-09 04:59:18
First off, fuck mumzie. She is still committing fraud by using a fake name and identity in a legal foundation.
AND MARKET! Jesus I remember you :D
DogePOS is not being worked on right now, I think it's just idling on Github at the moment.
@_date: 2015-03-07 04:27:27
Thats ok, thanks anyway :)
@_date: 2015-03-25 02:03:27
OH WOW, PATRICK HIMSELF? /s
He has no real athority to tell me any of her information is correct. Unless he knew who she was, which he doesn't.
@_date: 2015-03-07 04:24:19
That would be buying and selling, not accepting for products.
@_date: 2015-03-10 11:16:41
kek, Mitto (previously known as CoinTip (who is still active))
Hold on, what's your Slack? I can help you add CoinTip for Doge tipping at least. trying to rewrite Mitto from the ground up so he is not available right now.
@_date: 2015-03-25 01:42:39
For the record, this user has sent me a PM to ask to remove the above comments.
I will not release a Dox of anyone, you have to do your own digging, I can only provide the shovel. Looking at you, Mods, if you decide to remove my comment.
@_date: 2015-03-25 00:49:03
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ Find me some relevant public information on her. I answered your question pretty clearly, it was a yes or no question.
Relevant athorities? What kind of athorities? If you mean the department who just passes you guys off as a legally opperating foundation, they don't check very hard. It's non-profit, as long as no one is profiting, they aren't even going to look at you guys again. They record the list of names based on the information provided, and then they do jack shit to verify.
@_date: 2015-03-08 18:21:48
That's enough to fork it, but 90% is optimal if you want as much as your brain as used to support your opinion.
@_date: 2015-03-25 00:21:19
Yes, long long ago, in the distant 5 months, we were able to find mumzies' dox. Her other online aliases include "possummomma" and "Aithiest in a Minivan."
It took me a while to get through the posts, but somewhere there is mention of a name that is not "Debbie." This is not just my assumption, there is a long list of people who have dug around for this information.
It helps to know that she is one of few people that have a rare skin condition where they are seemingly allergic to sunlight (I am not making this up, back when DogecoinGroup was founded, she showed us multiple pictures of her skin trials). She wasn't terribly hard to find.
@_date: 2015-03-09 03:18:29
Have been for 3 years, I just haven't kept up with Doge recently :/
Still in contact with the lead devs on a daily basis, but not really active on the sub.
@_date: 2015-03-08 21:02:03
Compacted it for new users.
@_date: 2015-03-11 19:45:46
Mitto is built as a replacement for my project, CoinTip. Where CoinTip is Slack.com exclusive, Mitto is basically a much better ChangeTip IMHO
I'll PM you my email
@_date: 2015-03-10 00:49:11
Believe it or not, that DogecoinGroup slack chat is used daily still even after 10 months of being open, along with some projects that came out of it like my own crypto-tipping service that we expect to be kind of cool, since you get tipped in USD and the value hodls until you withdraw in your prefered currency.
And what's up with you?
@_date: 2015-03-25 01:48:25
I am literally not allowed to post more than what I have without breaking Reddit rules. I have offered evidence over PM, but I cannot provide it on Reddit. That's a rule you do not break, and one I have not broken.
@_date: 2015-02-03 12:19:43
You have set the icon manually.
Install instructions are there, we are using their server, not our own bot. It even says you have to set the icon yourself.
You are so quick to judge.


@_date: 2015-03-07 04:15:22
Me too, I was sad when I only saw a few listings.
@_date: 2015-03-25 02:05:34
You are so fucking cute, go back to playing with your threats of telling on people.
I'll get you what you want, but not on Reddit, and in private.
@_date: 2015-02-03 21:04:46
This seems shilly.
I don't like ChangeTip on Slack, I have my own service and we sat here laughing at this for a solid 20 minutes.
