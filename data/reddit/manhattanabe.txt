Hay, np.   I wasn’t saying the Fed doesn’t suck.   Just that it’s part of the government.

All the governors of the fed are appointed by the US federal government, and all the profits are given to the US treasury.  
@_date: 2019-07-20 13:53:57
This is a myth.

The fed has a board of 7 governors, all of which are nominated by the president and confirmed by congress.   
One of them, Jerome Powell, is the board chairman.   He was appointed by Trump, and is no middleman.   He makes the policy regarding interest rates in order the archive the dual mandate that was set by congress in 1977.   Of course, the Fed has many lower level employees are that were not appointed, but they don’t make policy.  
Dual mandate:

You can see her pic in my Reddit post history.

Yeah.  She hasn’t turned it on since.   We bought her a Mac.  
@_date: 2018-09-24 00:32:55
That’s what happened.  She even sent them a pic of her drivers license.    Not sure what was going on on the screen.   My brother walked in after 2 hrs and cut them off.

Of the top two,  BofA is getting credit for Merrill Lynch and Country Wide fines.   JPM is getting credit for Bear Stern fines.    Those 3 banks, plus others went bankrupt.   I doubt they think it was worth it.

There are about 126 wallets with over 10k bitcoins (about $60 million, each).  Some of these are exchanges and companies, but some are whales.   In my opinion,  if one of these tried to cash out all their coins , into FIAT, they would crash the market.   So, they hold and sell slowly.

The fed is creating money backed by the US economy.  People want $ because they want to buy American products.   
Bitcoin is unlimited.  It can be forked over and over again.  Also, it’s easy to create a new crypto currency if you want.  Just see all the thousands of alt coins.

Seems like a lot of work for $33/day.   I mean if it’s for fun, then ok.    You’ll also have to pay tax on your income.    You can make $20/day by just skipping Starbucks and brown bagging lunch.

Wait a few years.  You’ll be able to get it much cheaper.   ��

It was partially due the large number of bitcoins , bitcoin cash, bitcoin gold, bitcoin pizza , etc that were released in the last year.   To you, these might not be real bitcoins, but they did help debase its value.

If your money is legal, you inherited from grandma, the last thing you want to do is convert it to illegal money by moving it around anonymously.   You will get the best exchange rate by just converting it at the bank and wiring it to US account.   Both legal and easy operations.  
If your dealing with a corrupt government (China , Venezuela ) then bitcoin is useful in smuggling out money.

The banking fees for this transaction are around $100.   Not significant with $6000000.   There is no taxes on this.      If you use bitcoin , now you are taxed as a commodity    You can avoid these taxes, illegally, while keeping the money in bit coin.   Once you convert it to USD, questions will be asked.    So you try and hid this,  and your money becomes illegal.

These are institutional investors.  It’s not their money there losing.   It probably some pension fund.  In the worst case, the company just drops the pension and hands it off to the pensions benefit guarantee corporation.   In any case, the managers will be long gone by then.

He won’t be able to buy all the coins because the network will shut down before that happens.   No miners, no bitcoin.

The Gazans want to return to their ancestors homes in Jaffa,  Jerusalem, Haifa etc.    leaving them alone will not being peace.

In Manhattan , $1.7million USD will get you a 1br in a new building.  It will get you a 2br in an older building.

How many of the 1brs are in new buildings ?
@_date: 2019-01-06 14:36:49
So you agree that ‘leaving them alone’ as the OP wrote will not being peace.   I don’t know what the solution for Gaza is, but I do know that the clock can’t be turned back 70 years.

Of course it matters.  If the money supply is fixed,  is 21million bitcoin , you get deflation , which is horrible for your standard of living.   For an economy to grow, the money supply most grow with it.

Since bitcoin in the US, like gold, is taxed as a commodity , its very much not like a bank account.

Using bitcoin for illegal transactions.   Who would have predicted?   /s
@_date: 2018-12-13 01:44:14
You need to plot bitcoin per person.   Imagine what will happen when the supply of bitcoin will remains stable, but the population continues to grow.     Bitcoin will become scarce, and prices , in bitcoin, will go down.   This is called deflation, and  will greatly reduce the standard of living.
