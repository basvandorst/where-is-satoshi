What if a constant 1% inflation per year is adopted by another alt coin would bitcoin ever copy that if it turned out to be popular?
@_date: 2013-05-28 05:11:40
there are 2 types of investments.
1) I&lt;R. More people make this investment and crowding decreases the return until I=R and people stop investing. This is what is happening with asic investments right now.
2) I&gt;R. Keeping the money makes more sense then investing. So these investments are never made.
The problem with a capped currency is almost all investments fall into category 2 and therefore a bitcoin only world would stifle investment.

Ok what do you think is happening in the code when the reward transaction is added to the block? Where are the 25 bitcoins that are output to the miners chosen address coming from? 
I would agree that they aren't created if they already existed somewhere in some form but they don't. The software simply adds a transaction with no inputs, so 25 bitcoins can be added to the system.

Ok i'll reframe my question..
If a perpetual block-reward (no halving every 4 years) is adopted by another alt coin, would bitcoin ever copy that if it turned out to be popular? 
My question is hypothetical but my point is there are some lines bitcoin will probably never cross to appease the masses.
@_date: 2013-10-23 21:15:17
Transaction fees have not increased since January and to replace the reward that will be lost it needs to be increasing by 268% per year.

When the block rewards halves again mining will reach a point where energy costs will make a significant portion of miners start losing money.
This hardware that has become useless to these people will then flood the market at dirt cheap prices.
A smaller number of people who for whatever reason can get the cheap electricity will buy these up consolidating the hash power in fewer hands.
As these large players continue to compete by adding more and more hardware to their arsenals their margins will continue to drop.
Eventually they get together and say.. "hey we all are losing money here, why don't we agree to set quotas on how much hash power us big players are allowed to use. If anyone tries challenging this by using more then we say, we will temporarily increase our hashing and exclude them from the chain, until they give up."
They see this is a reasonable proposal and turn off 1/10 of their units and start making $1,000,000 worth of bitcoin each day rather than losing money.
But is this enough for them. Not at all. Here is where they can get really smart. There still is the problem of these pesky hardcore bitcoiners that have electricity included in the rent, so they continue to mine away while using more electricity then they make in fees.
How to deal with them? Simple, offer a new product to the people. Here is how it works. You pay $X a month to one of the big mining companies and they agree to give you Y free transactions for that month. X will be chosen so this is lower than what you probably would have paid in regular transaction fees.
With this setup the individual miner will have no way at making money off transaction fees since so many people will be using unlimited pre-paid plans that enable them to include no mining fee at all. This way the mining companies don't really care if solo miners want to keep mining as they have divorced the process of mining and the paying of transaction fees.

Miners decide which transactions will make up the blocks they attempt to make (they might decide to not include ones without fees). They also add the reward transaction with an output to their own address making the block unique to any block made by any other miner. And finally they try a bajillion different nonce values until they have a valid block to submit. I don't know how you can say they don't create blocks.


Verifying a block can be done by anyone since the mining problem is hard to compute but easy to verify. Miners buy the expensive rigs in attempt to **create** a valid blocks faster than anyone else not to verify blocks extra fast. If miners only verified blocks mining rigs would be pointless.

No one know if Satoshi's fortune of 1 million bitcoins is accessible or not. There is no way to know what is hoarding and what is lost, so saying its all out in the open isn't correct.

If bitcoin is successful why pay the early adopters 100s of billions rather then just implementing an identical altcoin using a SHA256 variant with a different set of coefficients. Satoshi owns 10% of the supply. That isn't going to fly as a global currency.

Do you think they picked the first 64 because of a special property that makes them secure? No, they picked them because that way no one can accuse them (the NSA) up picking a special set of numbers that give them a backdoor. There is nothing inherently more secure about the first 64 primes vs the second 64 primes. It was just a transparent way to generate a set of pseudo-random numbers.
EDIT: this explains the purpose of using the such a set of numbers.

Yes, but if you create a block you also must create the reward transaction. The reward transaction has no input therefore a successful miner creates bitcoins.

This is something I wondered about in general for pos purchases. Lets say I pay $1 to the machine with a standard mining fee and then after I get the pop I pay that same dollar to another account I own with a 25% mining fee. Which transaction is more likely to end up in the next block.

Assuming it could help who would even want to trade bitcoins for their inflating currency. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 19:23:25


Considering how many currencies exist I'm not sure I agree, but if it were true Bitcoin isn't guaranteed to be the one just because it is currently the largest. For example if Canada implements a CAD backed altcoin it would be very attractive to someone who wanted a stable cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2013-11-04 04:32:19
They can use a sybil attack. 


honest nodes have discovered a block X, it may seem to be at a disadvantage.
But a savvy pool operator can perform a sybil attack on honest miners by adding
a signi cant number of zero-power miners to the Bitcoin miner network. These
virtual miners act as advance sensors by participating in data dissemination,
but do not mine new blocks. (Babaio  et al. also acknowledge the feasibility of
such a sybil attack [10]). The virtual miners are managed by the pool, and once
they hear of block X, they ignore it and start propagating block P. The random
peer-to-peer structure of the Bitcoin overlay network will eventually propagate
X to all miners, but the propagation of X under these conditions will be strictly
slower than that of block P. By adding enough virtual nodes, the pool operator
can thus achieve 
 close to 1. The result, as shown in Equation 9, is a threshold
close to zero.
Edit: my understanding is a sybil attack shouldn't work because major pools connect directly to each other, so  random peer-peer propagation is a false assumption. Can someone comment on that?
@_date: 2013-06-08 04:25:29
The cabal could also could work without rejecting others blocks. They could offer a membership where you pay $X to have up to Y transactions processed for free each month (basically like what debit accounts do). By divorcing the fee payment from the mining process everyone not part of the cabal will have no way at getting money from the membership transactions. If X is set low enough the cabal will be able to drain enough money from the mining process that small miners will have to give up. Then the cabal can scales back their hashrate and start increasing X thereby drastically decrease their costs and increasing revenue.

The terms of service for a merchant to process credit includes restrictions on differential prices which is why you don't see any difference. 
Many small business are working together to take legal action against this because 3% fees can wipe out the profit margin on credit transactions. But completely refusing credit cards would lose them a lot of loyal customers. It's catch 22 for them, hence I'll call them outrageous fees.

there are 210,000 blocks per halving period with an initial reward of 50.
210,000*sum(50BTC *1/2^n) for n=0 to infinity = 21 million BTC
Basically the number is limited by the agreed upon reward schedule which determines how many can be **created** in each block. Any other reward schedule could have been chosen and if need be in the future the schedule can be changed if there is consensus.

He is 100% right about the gold standard. Under a gold standard, a gold coin is worth a gold coin and since gold is the standard a $50 gold coin will always be worth $50 dollars (the rest of the economy will have to adjust to make this work). What he says is tautologically true.

It would be impossible for current bitcoin ASICs to attack a altcoin that doesn't use SHA256. That is why I said using a SHA256 variant with a different set of coefficients. For example, SHA256 uses the first 32 bits of the fractional parts of the cube roots of the first 64 primes, so my hypothetical altcoin will use the next 64 primes preventing an attack from bitcoin. 


I think one person possibly holding 10% of the currency will be seen as a good enough reason by late adopters to adopt an altcoin.

@_date: 2013-08-19 16:47:47
I understand there is a hard limit planned for the number of bitcoins, but it is due to a halving period of 4 years, a average block time of 10 minutes, and a initial reward of $50. Do the math and you get 21 million coins. Those three numbers were arbitrary. Ago_Solvo is implying that the 21million number is in someway a fundamental property of bitcoin, but it really could have been a lot of other values and still worked. 
Also, in 20 years when hardly any new coins are being added, ***if*** enough people/miners think that deflation is a huge problem they can change the reward schedule. Not saying its going to happen but if there is a huge consensus there is no technical issue stopping if from happening.
@_date: 2013-07-05 04:13:31
I don't know anything about Mailchip so I'll take his word on that one. My comment was in regards to Google+ only ("What's Hot" is part of google+).
I have searched bitcoin on Google+ and got lots of results. In fact that is where I first stumbled upon bitcoin. The results have even been autotagged by Google+ with  I then clicked on that autotag and was presented with other related posts about bitcoin. Based on the above I believe Google+ isn't censoring the word bitcoin . 
Now there is another way to get your posts blocked. Google likes to crowd sources spam detection. If enough people mark something as spam it can get automatically removed from the stream. My guess is the people who think bitcoin is a ponzi scheme are marking his bitcoin posts as spam. So I'll believe certain Google+ users are marking certain bitcoin related posts as spam resulting in the authors frustration, but I'm not believing bitcoin is being censored by Google+.

@_date: 2013-08-18 05:40:13
I don't think you understand how the protocol works. We could after 21 million coins decide to make another 21 million coins if we felt like it simply by agreeing to accept blocks that generate 50BTC  again. If we felt like it we could agree that the 20th block found tomorrow can generate 1000 BTC. 
The only reason we are limited to 21 million is because that is the quota we have agreed to. There are not 9.5 million coins waiting somewhere to be unlocked, but we have agreed to only permit 9.5 million more to be created.

That is where I have been predicting the market will go eventually. The big miners will eventually be able to squeeze out all the little miners by making agreements to keep the transaction fees separate from the transaction. 
It won't be a big deal though until the block reward decreases to a point where fees are the important part of mining. But when that happens expect to see a consolidation of all hash power into the hands of just a few companies, and an end to decentralization.
