Yeah I'm confused...  I've poke around on this all before.  So I'm looking through it again now.  
From what I understand I have a bitcointip account but no btc wallet.  And it's possible to move btc from a wallet to a bitcointip account or vice versa.

Here's the video of the transaction.
He'll be talking about it all week.  I think it'd be interesting to give him some coin since it could be a bit of a shock to see his balance grow.

Where does this balance exist?  A bitcoin account?
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:30:59
I'm sure it's much easier to spend the money since I'm guessing you were given some money from Bloomberg to mess around with bitcoin!   Sounds fun to me.

By that logic, doesn't bitcoin provide the purpose of non-traceable/regulated transactions?  
I think it'd be important to focus on a basic economic topic to help explain.  For any item that can be traded there are two aspects that drive value fundamentals and technicals.  Fundamentals determine the value of the item based on basic tenets of the item.  For bitcoin a fundamental question is "How much would you pay to have non-traceable/unregulated currency?" "How much is that worth?".  That is the only fundamental purpose bitcoin presents and will determine a price.  Technicals are a form of supply and demand which determine price.  
I'm not sure that helps or adds to the conversation but I think it's important to understand in light of the craziness that is bitcoins.  They fundamentally haven't changed but technically are all over the place.

It's good to hear your experience but a 20% mark up is a big difficulty in my opinion, especially at today's prices.

Ah, yes.  If you're plugging in with a number of people, an exchange would likely not be a problem.  In some ways, that is a luxury you have because of being on TV.  The question remains, "How difficult is it to acquire bitcoin, if you have no previous connections to it?".  
Ha, sorry to say, I had to google your reference, but I feel a bit disappointed that I did.  Yes, there is a communal aspect which is hard to explain.  Try to explain it like a start-up.  People believe in the product not only for the possible monetary gains but also the mission it accomplishes.  I've seen you guys do segments on missional investing.  It's not all that different.

I just watched your most recent segment.  Adam's made a strong point that I think was a bit overblown.  He said something along the lines of "If you didn't know someone who already owned bitcoin, you couldn't have gotten them."  He's correct but I think it's worth noting that you attempted to purchase them during a small window of time when the price was highly volatile.  That could explain why some people were unwilling to sell at advertised prices or they were advertising coin they didn't currently hold.  
While you're doing your 12 days, it'd be interesting to see if you could sell some bitcoin using local bitcoins.  And then rebuy them back from someone else.  I have a suspicion you'll have difficulty but it'd be worth finding out.

Ok this makes much more sense with what I've gathered so far.  I'll have to get some btc in this account and play around a bit.  
@_date: 2013-11-07 19:03:46
I'm confused a bit about bitcointip.  Out of curiosity I just signed up.  Does that mean I have a bitcoin wallet?  I think the answer to that question is "no" but I'm not completely sure why.  I guess I'm confused by the difference between a bitcoin wallet &amp; bitcoin account.  
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:50:15
Nice!  He'll be talking about it all week or twelve days I guess.  It'll be interesting see how his segments develop over that time.  
I imagine he'll just buy a couple things and throw some of his bitcoin around to see how it works.  
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:44:39
I agree, as far as a currency it isn't the most functional at the moment.  I'll be watching your segments this week to see how the process goes for you.  Interesting to hear you had issues with local bitcoin, as I've always wondered about that.  Sorry to hear the guy at the Yonkers Starbucks didn't work out!
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:46:25
There's almost no question this'll happen.  But it's less clear what direction the jump will be.    
@_date: 2013-11-08 00:21:02
Thanks for the detailed reply.  The address/wallet distinction is exactly what I was looking for.   I never really grasped all the lingo so something like a simple transaction didn't fully make sense yet.  Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:36:23
That's what I was curious about as well.  I'm guessing not much.  Maybe you could figure out who Matt Miller got the bitcoin from?
