I frequently cash out because fiat is still far easier to use. But I make sure my freezer is stocked.

Maybe some of us will be able to afford a GPU for the actual display of graphics with enough coins.

Good work. I've noticed that most bitcoin communities aren't very helpful when it comes to expanding the usage and knowledge of what it is and how it works.  It's always a small yet somewhat undeserved victory for 'the community' overall when someone figures it out on their own through fear of being ridiculed online.

Looks like that was it.  I was letting armory run core automatically.   Doing it manually fixed the issue.
Like I said before, a captcha issue prevents me from registering on Bitcointalk (but once It's resolved i'll certainly do that)
Regardless; thank you for the help.

Oh I was unaware of Electrum that sounds amazing.  Not having to put the entire block chain on my computer is great.

Hahaha.   I'm not even gonna edit that out  Everyone needs to know of my failure.

When it was at parity, a colleague said 'I'm gonna buy 100 bitcoin, you should get some too'
I told him that was foolish, you can't buy anything with imaginary internet money. Don't waste your money.
His logic "well if it fails I would have spent it on crap anyway
100 btc x 4091.08 = 409,100.00  And while I don't talk to him often anymore. I do know that he kept up with it.  Since it's somewhat rude to ask someone how much money they actually have it gave me the vague answer of 'More than 50, less than 1000'.
Life happens.

I was first aware of bitcoin when it was around 1:1. but I thought it was silly and ignored it for years. After it was over 1000, i started watching it closely and I managed to grab a few coins when it was down around $300 or so for a few minutes. I was actually trying to grab it at 90. but considering I managed to get a few full coins out of it, I'm not upset at the extra expenditure.
I also started mining over a year ago, so the extra income , though nothing to live off of has been great.  My point; everyone needs to stop pissing the bed and get in on this.

Perhaps my issue then is that I am the only person in any of my circles that uses bitcoin.  The only place I've ever been able to pay directly with it is a local hipster coffee shop with a good wi-fi connection.  Thanks for your reply.
