Dont have a ledger nano , I'm helping my uncle buy bitcoin so he can send it over to his friend. He just wants to buy it and send it over so yeah no need for cold storage.

Not comfortable with linking my exchanges api. Is there a planned feature to add in my holdings manually?  
I'll still use the apps for the rest of its features. I'm loving how it feels.

Edit : short while. Maybe a couple of days tops.

Alright lets try to have a discussion, in economics you learn that money has usually three functions, a store of value, a means for exchange and a unit of account. 
What if one day people decide that bitcoin is worth nothing? Or what if one day every government decides to ban bitcoin, meaning you can't cash it in for FIAT. 
Before the downvotes start, let me just say that i believe in Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies, i believe in the idea of it. I just want to start this discussion so that i may be better equipped in the future when someone asks me this same question saying that bitcoin is a bubble.

Sorry for your loss. Was in your brothers situation myself. Put in a sizeable chuck of money ($5000) in bitcoin back in July. Im a student so most of the money I had earned working part time jobs and the like. 
I've since lost 80% of it on stupid trades and countless nights I spend thinking to myself how stupid I was for wasting all that money. 
Im not suicidal but I do get the occasional depressed thoughts. Just got to live life one day at and a time and just keep moving on.

Iirc, we also have to record the exact price and rate of bitcoin when we receive it and record the price change every month for accounting
