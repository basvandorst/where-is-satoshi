No, I've been trying to get my dad to buy since 2012. My dad just bought it at 10k because his co-workers told him about it.
When I first learned about btc, I thought it was really cool the way you can have digital currencies, but my dad said it's stupid. 
Regardless, my pov right now is these major trading groups still must have some influence on btc right?

I mean, the fake accounts were just to experiment, we deleted them afterwards.

I meant accounts like my family members. I even used fake accounts, they we're all restricted.

You're a noob and a half. I have a whole .2405 bitcoins. And I got in when it was 17k. So ha

@_date: 2017-12-09 11:28:21
Hmm you might be right. I might just sell like .05. it not like I have much anyway
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:51:22
Yeah what's so bad about that? It's not like I'm giving my SSN to the guy

I dunno, I just feel like wall street might wanna initially fuck over btc just to get in on it. I want to capitalize on that

I can't wait till all these losers come to us 10 years from now. People like this piss me off so much. They think we are uneducated, but they get all their news from fucking biased news channels.
