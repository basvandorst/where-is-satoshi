When donating to a charity that is not a 501c3 there should be NO expectation of transparency. Regardless of this being a 'Bitcoin' charity there is no legal obligation to prove what happens with designated funds and thus should be treated like they will not prove what happened with said funds.

Still could be, this could be tactic on creating a criminal haven and then shutting it down after the honey pot has produced the quotas of criminals they then need to bust.
Send a message and clean up the mess they've created.

You build it into the rule, so if the fund reaches x Bitcoin the funds get allocated. If instead Tuesday at noon happens first before the x threshold is hit then allocation happens of what had been contributed to that point. The time/date quantifier would have to be agreed on and set up at the same time as the amount of Bitcoin to be reached. So it would be like an auto distributed kick starter, where if the btc amount is not hit the funds received to that point is still allocated.
I hope this addresses your point, I'm a little confused on what is being missed by my statements.

I suppose you can quantify it to seconds (or computer cycles) until that time occurs. Like how there can be only so many Bitcoins created you could get a consensus in the same manner by saying after so many seconds (enough that gets us to 2015) a distribution has to happen. Once it's set there's no changing it like the amount to earn.
Don't necessarily have to guarantee it, maybe once xyz block is mined on the block chain the distribution happens, but that wouldn't have the luxury of being a specific time.
@_date: 2014-10-11 00:10:13
I will ... As soon as it is available and distributed freely on YouTube (or the like). I'd actually pay for it too (by donating far more then what they are requiring for a price).
@_date: 2014-10-23 21:06:33
Yeah... Let me know how that goes, if they ran it with transparency you should have understood that does not stand based on methodology (since they haven't done things like file for 501c3). Now that they have burned the community it's setting a standard that all non profits will not justify they're spending habits and destroys legit non profits like mine from ever gaining traction because it's assumed to be a scam or that we won't cite where the funds go.
I'm very disappointed with the donation model of this community and it is directly to blame on them.

It's pretty clear that the 'get wealthy' stage is long over, the lose your wealth stage is ending, and now we are entering the retaining your wealth due to deflation stage (compared to current forms of money). I've owned for the ride and will continue because it's principles are sound and the technology is the most logical form of money my generation has seen thus far.

Our organization with the help of (our local) community feeds 4 people for a buck ... The cost of meals referenced here are outrageous.
Plus, I feel the (Bitcoin) community has the one trick pony of Sean's Outpost and does not even consider contributing to other similar causes... Now even the Outpost have had this community turn on them.
Just look at the post I made the other day:
0 up votes and ignored into oblivion.

Was so disappointed they didn't release it under a donation based model after raising the funds in that manner that I refuse to even watch the thing.
If it was released on a donation based model, available to watch on YouTube, and true to Bitcoin philosophy it would have made a difference.... Since it wasn't, it won't.

I updated it to read:


That's the best I'm going to do. I cannot refute the claim of association with the other items as they can be cited just fine with articles like this:

It's cute you think the things you do aren't subsidized.
Taking advantage of the weak is unacceptable. And, who says we are over populated? That's a sad amount of misinformation you allow your self to have there.

But if the determination is never hit then it would be in limbo, I guess adding a time frame on top of the match would solve that.

Count as organizations that if you donate to would fall under this bad actors clause... 
Didn't know I would need to explain that... I mean this is a post about donating and having legal ramifications, I listed off two other entities and figured it would be understood as relative to the post.
@_date: 2015-04-01 21:11:56
They don't have to be transparent. A 501c3 non profit has to be transparent. As far as I can tell Sean's Outpost is not a 501c3 therefore I doubt their spending habits.
Getting a 501c3 is a hassle, but any nonprofit without it I question their motives. They are not legitimizing themselves and I question management on their competency or if they are disqualified from the title for legitimate reasons.
@_date: 2015-04-28 01:39:28
Distribution happens by patients.
@_date: 2015-04-01 21:44:22
Yeah, providing copies of their organization's tax returns would legitimize them a little more for myself. Either way though the question still stands on why they do not have the 501c3 and what the motives are. There could be good reasons but it still seems a little shady.
Plus, who is to say who has actual ownership of the assets purchased by the organization. That's another hidden benefit that the people running it could see.

In his state.
@_date: 2015-04-02 02:28:33
My point exactly, while being a hassle it's not difficult. The motivation for them, I assume, is to be for the reason of pocketing or the exact opposite of transparency with their donations. Or, they don't qualify for it because of the before mentioned items. Let me see tax records, plain and simple. Legitimacy is earned through public and *true* information, these guys feel like the Mt Gox of non profits for Bitcoin.
