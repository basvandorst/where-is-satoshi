I haven't been able to get mine to stay linked to Coinbase long enough to use it.

I'm really not.  I hold a fair amount of BTC myself.
I don't like the concept of transactions falling out of the mempool, though - transactions that are initiated should happen.
My personal preference is that the block size be big enough for transactions to happen.  Barring that, they should be retransmitted until the backlog clears up a bit.  Retransmission is more useful than letting them fall out and having empty blocks later.

Use your seed specifically, or combine your seed with the existing random data?
Or something like PuttyGen, where you can add a source of randomness on the fly?

We are using the [Kinetis K81](  
It's designed to run in credit card terminals, and meets PCI and FIPS security requirements.
@_date: 2017-02-16 22:09:48
Would it be OK, then, if we implemented compatibility with TREZOR?

We'll reach out and see if they would mind.  Our process flow is a little different, but interoperability is a good thing.
The derivative work thing can be overcome easy enough (and one of the reasons that the GPL can be neutered if someone really wants to).  To do it, you create a plugin architecture in your application, and plugins for it.  Next, you incorporate GPL code into the plugin.
The software can't be a derivative work of the plugin - it's entirely functional standalone, and pre-dates the plugin.  The plugin itself is certainly a derivative work of the GPL and original plugin (and would need to be open-sourced), but as long as it followed your own established API, it would be no different than a third party creating a plugin for your open architecture.
What we're trying to avoid is putting another bitcoin company in the position to have a decent case against us.  We'd rather be safe than sorry.

If we can legally get away with it, the plan is to be compatible with the trezor interface.  It's easy enough to do, the question is the legality of doing so.  Courts haven't been entirely consistent on the matter.
We're using Mycelium for development initially, but will be opening up the API so that any application that wants to use it will be able to.  It's a bit easier when the hardware is integrated (we have a better idea of which applications are making the calls).
Since the keys are stored in the vault, a rogue application (particularly on an device with a privilege escalation attack) can send a rogue bitcoin transaction to the wallet, but without the on-device confirmation, it won't go anywhere.
@_date: 2017-02-16 22:05:28
This is the preferred approach with our wallet, as well.  
In secure mode (which we recommend), the chip will self-destruct if you try to upgrade the firmware, or trip a tamper.  If that's the only place your bitcoin keys are stored, you are SoL.
If you import an offline seed, that's not a problem.  We even offer the ability to load it into a smart card (SIM size) on an offline computer, booted off a read-only media.  That way, your wallet never sees your secrets, and neither does your device.
@_date: 2017-02-16 17:50:09


Yes.  I was trying not to focus on the attacks against other wallets.


We start with a [Kinetis K81]( secure MCU as the base.  It's protected against differential voltage attacks, clock glitching, and has active protection against temperature and voltage-based attacks.
It features a MPU to ensure that any segment of memory that is writable is not capable of execution, and vice versa, except when in flash mode.  To prevent us being able to compromise security, we offer a secure mode where placing the device into upgrade mode erases the secrets.
To that, we add a TI smartcard interface controller and SIM tray.  This makes it possible to load the secrets from (for example) an offline computer, and install it directly into the unit, without the need to trust the host phone.
We also have an e-Paper display and touch screen controller for the device itself, driven by the K81, so that when an address is displayed, or money is sent, other applications on the device can't impersonate the wallet or overlay the wallet with bogus information.

Now you know how some of us feel about SegwitCoin.  Since actual Bitcoin is no longer an option, Bitcoin Cash will have to do.

Wouldn't be the first buying opportunity after a bitcoin crash.

BCC isn't going to die.  There are already 6 blocks, so the difficulty adjustment is going to happen.
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:01:24
There were groups that agreed because they wanted large blocks, and either disliked or didn't care about segwit.  The point of 2x was to upgrade to larger blocks, otherwise they would have just gone segwit in the first place.
Full mempools were the leverage to coerce people into letting segwit happen, instead of it just stagnating at 40% support.  To make the agreement, then back out now would be dishonest.
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:40:41
The SegWit downgrade was compulsory for everyone who used the chain, as there was no way to avoid segwit transactions.  The threat of UASF was introduced to compel people to signal, bypassing the consensus rules - segwit was unable to get majority hashpower without it.  By "reaching an agreement" with Segwit2x, the 2x carrot was dangled to get people to ignore the segwit stick, then the agreement was broken as soon as Core got what they want.
The definition of BitCoin is a chain of transactions - a blockchain.  Off-chain transactions are not part of that, and therefore (by definition) SegWitCoin is an altcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-21 22:52:12


Of course.  SegWit1x was a coercively-hardforked altcoin, so why why would 2x be any different?
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:41:19
So, lie to get buy-in, then backstab?
And you wonder why some of us don't want anything to do with core, and didn't want to negotiate on segwit?
Strangle the blocks, then offer a "solution" that isn't.

I was ready to declare Coinbase likely insolvent because of things like losing my wire transfer and taking over a month to do anything about it.  At the very least, they are incompetent and don't take care of the customer.
Finally had to threaten to file a police report to get an answer back that wasn't a form letter.

For what it's worth, I have reason to believe I've found some vulnerabilities in Trezor's security.  I wouldn't suggest using a tampered device.
@_date: 2016-09-20 17:13:51
I'll do some more formal announcements later, if it pans out.  The basic vector of attack involves the power, and the way code is written and assembled.
As a (oversimplified) example:
Suppose you write some code like this - 
    if (user_is_not_admin()) {
        return error_message();
    } 
    execute_command();
What matters is the machine instructions  - in this example, the pseudo code represents a translation of the actual instructions.  So, the processor calls a function, and a register gets set.  That register is then tested with a conditional jump - if the user is not an admin, then the command dies.
The way to exploit this is to mess with the power.  By carefully glitching the power on the processor, it's possible to get it to skip the test instruction, the conditional jump.  So, the chip will call the is_admin check, then ignore the result.
The result looks something like [this](
I have a few other attacks I suspect it's vulnerable to, but it's not a bad little device.  It's a lot more secure than most devices that handle Bitcoin.
