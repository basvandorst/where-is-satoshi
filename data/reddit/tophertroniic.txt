So, did you just hold them?

Hi , I'm really interested in this topic also.
The value propopsition of a blockchain platform for the renewable energy industry is to have a global accounting of value exchange between distributed points of a large scale network. Distributed points of energy generation. Distributed points of energy storage. Distributed points of energy consumption.
All managed and paid for by microtransactions, and largely autonomously. Streaming value between production and consumption, just like the electricity itself.
This PDF from Siemens gives some context to the first project you linked to.
Some major discrepancies in Siemen's PDF, their TransActive Grid project is built on Ethereum. ConsenSys is an Ethereum developer, not Bitcoin. Whoever wrote it must not have known the difference. They also state that in Bitcoin "there are no charges" which is effectively false.
The other project you linked to, Electron (UK), is also built on Ethereum. More about that here:
Grid Singularity (Austria) is working with EthCore, developing on Ethereum. Just briefly mentioned here:
GE has mentioned blockchain applications:
PowerLedger (Austrailia) uses a private chain, EcoChain:
Filament and IDEO are working on Nasdaq's Linq blockchain:

Agreed - energy network projects really just come down to sophisticated payment networks. Bitcoin's high fees are inherently limiting / confirmation times are slow / not as easily programmable on the network. I don't know of any energy projects based on Bitcoin actually.
The top three energy projects I know of are built on Ethereum right now.

i think it means bitcoin gets boring :)
seems like it could remain as high value reserve status due to sustained belief and network effects, but high fees and 10 minute blocks don't cut it for interesting future use cases. blockchain promised instantaneous transfers and negligible transaction costs, which BTC wouldn't compete on. distributed network research and financial innovation goes to other platforms. they could tie back into BTC when requested, but they would be unlikely to be developed on BTC itself because it's slow, expensive, limited.
another platform has the opportunity to provide digital value transfer infrastructure to billions of people.
public databases are implemented on something effectively just as verifiable and trusted as BTC, but cheaper and more dynamic.

Trump has repeatedly promised greater military spending. It was a central promise of the campaign. Even the most cursory look at budget plans and the expected national debt show how uninformed your statements are. Bannon was interviewed by the Hollywood Reporter shortly after the election. He said that current low interest rates provide the greatest opportunity ever to spend.

ITT: a schizophrenic dismissal of securities innovation?
Coinbase just published a legal framework for tokens, and this announcement immediately follows. The "altcoin" frame of reference doesn't even apply here - they are not competing currencies. Andreas, and probably others, were talking about this type of development three years ago. Don't fall behind.

The trend in fees, is most definitely not a downward one.
People are competing with each other to willingly hand over their BTC to miners in order to get their transactions through a clogged network. Miners are banking a sick 15% bonus on top of the normal block reward.
