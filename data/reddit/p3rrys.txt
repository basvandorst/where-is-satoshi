I can explain u. 30 tons (kilo’s) potato = 70K �� is around the 70,000 euro - machinery/ people and other costs 45/50k pure profit 
I think potatoes are more worth than trading or hold crypto

I live in a village in the Netherlands I have 400mbits up and down here, i think that is no problem.. I’m not comfortable with Windows and have a IMac 5K but that is for business usage. I want no private stuff on it.

Yep on the website not on the app,! Thanks! Which Chromebook would be suitable for binance?
