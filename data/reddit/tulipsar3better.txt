I'm just wondering why the lies? Why not just be like yeah we have the keys but we're not giving them to you. 
And technically no I don't have to withdraw Bitcoin I can just sell Bitcoin

Oh and answer your question about proving origin. I just mean his ability to prove it the transaction came from his account. he's verified on Poloniex and Paxful. They have his ID, he could easily prove that he is the  "owner" of said accounts. (I use the term owner loosely)

It may be a misnomer, however when you are writing a legal document or legal terms of service, you don't use misnomers
@_date: 2019-09-18 02:34:13
Yeh. They just have to send an Omni Layer transaction back to the poloniex wallet.
@_date: 2019-09-18 02:16:35
Absolutely. 
We are well aware this is no one's fault but his. 
What really grinds my gears is the shadiness with which Paxful has dealt with this. They don't even want to help. They have lied to both of us.   My friend and I have traded over 10k each this month alone.  How much $ do they make from that?

BTW, I do appreciate you taking your time to have this discussion with me, and at no point in time have I ever been offended or felt like I wasn't being taken seriously.
So let's say  all the security hurdles, red tape, and other reasons to not do this weren't there.
How difficult is the task itself to do?  Because I have the understanding that to find the tokens, import to a wallet and then send the tokens back, again barring all of the red tape issues, is actually pretty easy. Am I wrong in this? I'll be honest when I'm not 100% familiar with the omnilayer
@_date: 2019-09-18 01:17:20
Eh not exactly. It's more a case of a mistake a friend of mine made... It has a SIMPLE fix ... So frickin easy .... But Paxful says  "IDGAF" apparently
@_date: 2019-09-18 02:17:47
I'm loving all the fantastic beside the point points
@_date: 2019-09-18 01:52:57
What scam? My friend sent it to his own account, from poloniex to paxful without converting it first... There was zero scam involved. Just a fuck up.
@_date: 2019-09-18 01:54:52
LOL yes kind of... However that was sent to him by someone else who paid him that way. 
So I see your beside the point point. But that's beside the point you see
@_date: 2019-09-18 05:07:17
I like this. We have plenty of lawyer friends who would do that no problem
@_date: 2019-09-18 02:41:50
Woah.. please elaborate.. 
Thank you for bringing something valuable to this ..
@_date: 2019-09-18 15:49:58
What are your thoughts on the proving origin of the transaction. Someone said poloniex wouldn't divulge account info. What info do you think is necessary for Paxful/BitGo to acknowledge point of origin?
@_date: 2019-09-18 05:06:00
I meant back to HIS poloniex wallet.. Asin send a new transaction
@_date: 2019-09-18 15:50:31
I see
@_date: 2019-09-18 17:17:27
Fine. As far as my question here though... It's my time to waste isn't it? 
If you found that it's a waste of your time to continue this conversation I don't blame you. 
However I would still like to know what would prove the origin/orginator of the transaction.
@_date: 2019-09-18 18:20:17
I guess it depends on what you qualify as young.  
I understand there's no financial gain for them to help me in a sense. But that's not why I do things. Like the reason I'm helping my friend... I stand to gain nothing from this except knowing that I helped somebody who needed it... The same reason I will pull my car into a parking lot and go back and help push somebody's car out of the road in the middle of the night. The same reason I hold doors for people. The same reason I help an old lady put her heavy groceries in the car... Not because I stand to gain anything from it, but because it's the right thing to do. 
The only way that they do stand to gain anything is the fact that him and I trade up to 10k per day which they get 2% of.  I'm pretty sure they have a corner on the market so I can't imagine we're going to be heading over to localbitcoins anytime soon but it does make me stop and consider looking for another platform. 
I understand the needs for some of these rules, and if they break the rules for me then where does one draw the line?
. however, I also think that complacency is not something to be complacent about...

I lol'd at yours too ��
@_date: 2019-09-18 01:33:41
They aren't the 3rs party. According to them anyway... Also you do have your own wallet there, if you explore your wallet it shows you your balance.
@_date: 2019-09-18 01:24:35
The funny thing is is if you look under their privacy terms the part that specifically talks about YOUR data that they collect, one of the things they say they will collect about you is the private key for your wallet.....
