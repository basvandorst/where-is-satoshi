Banks and governments are creating blockchains to back up their crappy currencies and communicate with one another.
We need to resist these and support public chain currencies.

You'd borrow inside something like a lightning network. You'll be able to use the funds inside the network but to close the channel you'll have to pay it all back plus any interest that was in the conditions when opened.
Just a thought.

Because it isn't controlled by any single entity, it's mathematically sound, it's deflationary, it's truly peer to peer, it "can be" anonymous... Anything else?
@_date: 2017-09-18 23:51:35
The article never mentions WHAT Bitcoin is, completely missing the point of why it's users believe in it, which is where it derives primary value.
Poor work and clickbait for the WSJ.

Bitcoins are not serialized. You only have a number representing how much you have.

Next question is... Google. How does it work?

Scammy. Came out of no where. Small team and no community. Capitalizing on fomo.

We'll have to see how the behavior pans out... Around 2140.

I agree with costs for intermediaries that add value. But there's too many that don't. Governments are bloated and inefficient. A lot of law is a mess. Financial instruments and accounting run amok.
If we can remove SOME of the "creative" practices these fields have enjoyed, I think we would all be better off.
More open and transparent societies should ultimately lead to more fair societies.

Wow you need to learn what Bitcoin is... It doesn't work like that at all. Please read.

First part yes. Build the platform. Second part no... Decentralized means no one needs to ensure trust between users. That's the users problem. Caveat emptor.
OP is about how blockchain can take the centralized models of Uber or Airbnb's and melt that control, development and platform maintenance decision making into the hands of the systems users.

It's highly divisible. Satoshis are the base and even still you could build a layer on top of Bitcoin that would divide those!
