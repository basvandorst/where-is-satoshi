Some people are afraid of using Bitcoin XT because they say that only one person controls it. It could perhaps be less fearful if the patch be hosted in the github.com/bitcoin account, and only include the bip 101 stuff and not the other (albeit minor) features Bitcoin XT offers. To successfully run it you would need both the binary releases in github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin and github.com/bitcoin/scalability-patch.
Chinese miners said they don't want to use Bitcoin XT. Maybe that's the main reason I'm posting this...

Well, currently it's suggested that people use Bitcoin XT, which would be pretty much Bitcoin Core but that can scale.
Another option would be to include the changes in Bitcoin Core, but that requires consensus among the developers of that particular Bitcoin implementation.
@_date: 2015-06-16 09:17:12

[The site I submitted to the Coinbase hackathon]( has this feature: You connect your Coinbase account and you get an address by which, if you send bitcoins to it, they would be automatically sold. Of course, with this announcement, this feature is pretty much obsolete.
Makes me wonder if they got inspired by it. In any case I think it's a feature that must exist somewhere.
My site also allows you to create addresses which automatically top up your phone, convert to an altcoin, and split them among several addresses. They idea is to keep adding accounts which you can load by simply sending bitcoin to a determined address.
The only drawback right now is that you would get charged an extra bitcoin network transaction fee, but will probably be removed in the future.

If Bitcoin infrastructure is well built then Average Joe won't have to hear about bits of entropy and 256 bit keys at all.
If someone is interested in learning the nuts and bolts of Bitcoin, he could be lead through the documentation simply noting when it's needed "The word 'bit' here is not related to the currency unit", and stuff like that. I don't think someone with an interest in the inner workings of Bitcoin would find that hard to understand.

I think this is a philosophical question. I think the answer is that nothing has intrinsic value.

I heard a "let's talk bitcoin" episode in which they discussed why "be your own bank" is a terrible slogan. They said that the user shouldn't have to worry about security as much as a bank has to. That sites that blockchain.info need to implement saner security policies for instance, so the user is better off. (This was before Andreas joined the team).

The key could also be sold. What if the system uses the James D'Angelo idea of using a picture for identification in some way?
Let's say I associate a picture with a fingerprint in the blockchain. Then the receiver can go to the kitchen, and if the picture appears, searched by name, then the person can proceed to make the payment with his finger. If the picture does not match the person, it probably means he cut someone else's finger, so the server can refuse service.

I think the main reason to put bitcoin on hardware is security. The hardware should never expose the private keys; only signed transactions. This way it's not vulnerable to hackers extracting your private keys from your software.
@_date: 2015-09-24 04:08:20
How can we trust that they don't know the private keys? Can the user wipe the device and generate new keys like the trezor?

But this is against the KISS principle. Change to the bitcoin consensus is a big deal. That's why I think the simpler the better. I think it's reasonable to raise the cap but keep it limited, to see how that goes. If everything goes alright the limit could be removed completely.

Gavin made some tests. 8GB down the line will be like 8MB now.
@_date: 2015-11-07 17:43:45
Yes it solves it. Starting with an 8MB means no one would be able to produce a 10 GB block right now, which without a limit, would be possible.
@_date: 2015-03-18 05:50:41
Entropy is fear. 666
@_date: 2015-11-07 01:04:54
I think a cap should be in place so there's not a *sudden* peak. Originally, the 1 MB cap was set in place to prevent an attack, where if some miner mines a gigantic block, and then mine on top of it while the rest of the miners try to validate this giant block, gaining a slight advantage.
Also, there's uncertainty. I prefer controlled variables when you know what the limits are. If you remove the limit altogether, probably no one knows what's gonna happen. I think the majority of software engineers would like to keep things under control.

It's better to have predictability so people can plan for the future. If you think about it, the supply of bitcoins is also a parameter that was set in advance, and that allows us to predict exactly the amount of bitcoins that there will be at a certain time. Could a different supply cap have been better in hindsight? Maybe, but now that it's set we can plan around it. 
The same applies to block size. With something like BIP 101, which proposes a certain growth curve to the maximum block size, miners would be able to predict the max block size 1 week, 1 month or one year from now. They would be able to determine if they will need to upgrade the bandwidth in the future, if the business model they have makes sense, and so on. Predictability is really important for any kind of enterprise with long term plans.

He mostly did a general outline about the subject, covering many different topics, but I think most of all he covered the relationship between the government and bitcoin. Namely, the goverments will attack bitcoin with politics and regulations, but bitcoin will likely prevail. He mentions that if bitcoin were to became 10% of the System D market, it would be huge already, so bitcoin can prevail even if businesses are not legitimately allowed to use it.
Also, he compared bitcoin with fiat currency and the many benefits of bitcoin over the latter.

So maybe the site just displays the address next to the post, but users don't send directly to it. Users, when they upvote just tell the server to use funds from their account, which they loaded to the site, for the post (not a bitcoin transaction but an abstraction on the server).
Then, say every 24 hours, the site sends the accumulated bitcoins to the address.
Users are assured the funds are going to the proper destination by looking at the blockchain.

I think someone needs to check that you bought the items when you exit the store...
Wait, maybe not. Implementation idea: every item has a chip with a code that makes the alarm go off it you try to exit without paying it. But if someone pays for the item, the chip is deactivated so you can exit freely.

Dude, people wanting to buy bitcoins because it might be worth more in the future *is* the demand that drives the price up. It's still supply and demand.

I thought about this and thought "Someone will take them all".
Although now that I think about it, the chances that a bitcoin savvy person crosses that sign are slim compared to people who don't know.
Hmm, still someone could take all the little papers...
I mean, one could just give away papers like these on the street and would avoid that possibility.

I think preferring a method of storage because it's cool can be dangerous.
That may be the main reason why people make brain wallets, which is generally a really bad idea. "Dude, I have the bitcoins stored *in my brain*."
I must admit I sometimes bias towards cool ways to store the bitcoins.

I agree. People care about "How is it useful for me?".


Another strength would be immunity to inflation.
Here in Argentina, where inflation soars, I think if someone asks me "What is Bitcoin?" I would say: "A currency immune to inflation". I expect the immediate response to be "WHERE DO I GET THEM?"

Approximately April 4th from [this video]( It's an interview to "Zander Marz" (it's a pseudonym), who's the author of [Beyond the Government Haunted World]( Bitcoin mention at [36 min](
When he talked about a "P2P currency", I went "whaaa? how the hell would that work?". I went to bitcoin.org squinting my eyes like "what the hell is this?". Then I think I saw a post about the April bubble, found this subreddit and took it from there.
Edit: Actually the youtube video was [this one]( it's the same video but the guy that runs the channel decided to make a new channel with a different name and copy all his videos there.

It seems blockchain.info is really easy to hack? It's like the third post I see on wallet theft on that site.
@_date: 2013-09-29 02:56:35
Yes. I guess it's a matter of trust in the seller. They *say* in the website that they make sure the private key is only printed once, and there's no other copy anywhere. But I guess you can never be sure.

I think they need to change MultiBit to prevent this from happening. I think the copy to clipboard button in the send tab should be removed, it's not that necessary.
They should make it so you can copy an address that you sent to from the transaction history, not directly from the tab.
PS: It happened more than once, I almost make this mistake myself, the tabs look very similar.

Yeah it was really clever that it enumerates the benefits before naming what it is. It gets you pumped for this new "product". And one may tend to forget that bitcoin is all that and has all those awesome properties, which it does.

Interesting idea. Similar to that may be a website where any user says: "I want to buy a taco from John Doe's tacos with bitcoin", and mark it on the map. More people can pledge the same for that merchant and the requests accumulate. The users optionally put a small bitcoin deposit for a merchant they wish accepted bitcoin. The first user that announces that John Doe is accepting bitcoins now, gets all the accumulated bitcoins deposits, but first some percentage of users indeed verify that John Doe accepts bitcoins.
This way, the more users wish for a merchant to accept bitcoin, the more incentive would be for people to try to convince that merchant. Also, the merchant itself can see the pledges of users that want his business to accept bitcoin, motivating the merchant as well.
A person wanting to convince the merchant can go with a tablet with the map and say "LOOK all these people want you to accept bitcoin, and would probably be your clients if you start doing so". If the merchant agrees, everybody wins.
@_date: 2013-12-09 15:48:37


Because you don't really know how much gold there is. Sure it's scarce but they're finding gold in meteorites now. There may even ways to generate gold in the future. With bitcoin you know exactly how many they are.

* Convert USD to SLL (Linden): 2.9% + 50 SLL
* Convert Linden to BTC:          2.9% +50 SLL
* Bitcoin withdrawal:                0.01 BTC

@_date: 2013-12-22 09:04:39
It's just not very accessible right now.
Devices need to come out that make it easier to spend and store bitcoins. A step towards that would be the planned protocol to have wallets with nicknames (don't know how the proposal is called).
Also, maybe aversion towards new things.

I think the protocol will have the functionality to program an address to send the bitcoins to another address if certain condition checks out on the internet.
In your case, the condition could be that the address has been inactive for a while.
