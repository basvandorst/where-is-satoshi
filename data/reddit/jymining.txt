In behalf of freeShippingIsLaw...
Nice thought!
Here's my attempt at supposing what may unfold.
BTC price volatility is pressured to move upwards because saturation of this market is not yet met. Once the BTC market reaches that beautiful threshhold level of supply meeting demand, stability of its price will begin. Following this comes the second coming of its utility - a static storage of value, since mining will most likely be complete at this stage. The BTC is divible up to 8 decimals, so the maximum supply of ~21million minus all those permanently lost, say 15 million for this example's sake, can technically supply up to 15,000,000 x 100000000 units of measure, or 1500000000000000 satoshis. Can someone please critique this? Thanks.
