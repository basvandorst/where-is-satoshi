I hate these kind of posts, it´s like some old farts would post on an Apple thread "If you´ve been in Apple since 1994 or so it´s been at the top for a while ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
But there thankfully aren't, and people are discussing current price.
But i get it, everyone wants to convince subliminal way..the other person holding the bags at a much higher price.. that someday he might be the one saying in 2025 
"If you've been in bitcoin since 2018 or so it's been at the top for a while ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"

Cryptos in general are just an invention for the founders and early buyers to get rich, the late buyers get feeded the dream of "replacing fiat"  
Replacing fiat with something deflationary like crypto is lunacy.

"""No, it won't drop under $2k because its far under the cost of production."""
What the hell does that have to do with the spot price of Bitcoin ?
Many coins have fallen under their "cost of production"
Price is simply buyers and sellers, when there are more sellers then buyers price goes down to find a buyer.
Nothing to do with Cost of production kiddo.
Either way,  why dont you enter a trade.. highly leveraged and put a stop loss at 2,000USD.. if the price reaches previous highs of let say 16-19k..well enjoy your sweet 100% guaranteed profits.

Basically Mozambique wanted more money to lend, and ECB gave it..

Gold is gold, created by exploding stars.. its unique and one of a kind.. its a rare metal.. you cant duplicate it.. and it has no competition.. 
Right now there are 1629 "Gold" on coinmarket cap, all with a different name.. Once Bitcoin-Gold was worth 9 times more then Ethereum-Gold, now its only worth 2 times more.. 
Gold has no competition, its beautiful, and rare.
Has a track record of 5,000 years etc..
Will Bitcoin or any other Crypto become better than Gold? Never.
More Value able than gold? Yes,.. better? no.
Ask yourself this question as i asked a streamer once.. when he was trading around January.. 
If you won 1,000,000 dollars and you could only collect the winnings after 5 years.. but in the meanwhile you HAVE to choose where to allocate the won money for 5 years.. either Bitcoin or Gold.. This streamer laughed at me and got me banned, and said what a stupid question and definitely "crypto" for 5 years.. well turns out that his 1 million would be at around 400,000 worth now.. while if he invest in gold he would be +/- 1%.. 
And thats why gold, is a store of value.

There is absolutely no "invention" that can replace fiat.
Its far to easy for my mother to go down to the mall use her VISA or Cash to pay for things, she could not care less about the "middleman".. all she cares about is safety and goverment backed insured money.. she uses money to transact and buy things and do here haircut.. and thats all it is to it.

"""Decentralization is a solution to centralization. When you can eliminate the man in the middle, what use do you have for the man in the middle?
If I can hand you cash or something of value in person, why can't I do that over the internet without having to involve another party."""
Decentralization  is not the solution to centralization, its just means not being centralized. only if you define Centralized like some kind of cancer or fatal injury.
sounds to me like you want to sell drugs? i myself see a trusted middle man a solution to no middle man.. example: My mothers credit card got copied on a device where you pay.. they took all the money from her bank account.. 1-2 calls to the bank.. and she got all her money back
great use of a middleman, also easier for me my grandma or whoelse to loose their money being their own "bank" then it is for a bank.
I would only care of not having a middle man if i was in to selling drugs or any illegal activities. 
Which are these countries where the goverment robs their bank account and credit card?.. sounds to me its more an issue of the country.. then the Banking/Fiat system. 
So if i get it right, Bitcoin is a solution for poor and corrupt countries that get their money stolen from their credit cards by the government.
Keep in mind if a Warlord running an African country,

Well it´s your own doomsday theory, even if right.. still has nothing to do with the spot price "cant or wont".. price can go as low as it wants and high as it wants.. its all about demand.. 
I´ve been in the markets for a very very long time, and in no market.. be it forex, stock, bonds.. is their a thing like "There is now way it can go there"
Look what happened to Eur/Chf.. the swiss bank kept buying the Euro as soon as the price reached a certain level.. to keep the price  at a certain level.. they did this for some years. "they pegged it"
When suddenly out of nowhere, Swiss banks decided to unpegg it.. we had the largest crashes in the history of Forex..
Same thing might happen to bitcoin, it might not.
One thing is for certain, people are kinda "pegging" Bitcoin.. buying the dips etc..

A global deflationary currency that would stop a thriving economy, empower and enrich the criminals and demolish a multi trillion dollar banking system.

Because either we make up wealth or all the No coiners get 80% less wealthy..
And it aint getting any rosier the longer the world waits to adopt..

101% are in it for the wealth, if not one can just wait for the "mainstream adoption and killing of fiat" which will never ever happen, except in a 24 year old beanie wearing weed smoking persons illusion.
So i´ll just not buy any stupid crypto and wait, and if i can buy coffee and pay bills and tax in crypto it will just happen automatically, i wont get rich or poor.. i will just start using crypto without the risk of getting financially ruined currently..
OR are you telling me that if i dont buy Bitcoin now, i face homelessness later on because it will be to late and all fiat users wont afford a single coffee.

I hope for your sake that you are 21 and smoke weed from time to time, an innocent soul rather than a complete lack of real knowledge and critical thinking adult..
You actually still think that Crypto is the solution to the world problems, one of them being House bubble?
China,  Russia, The Fed, Crisis, 2008, Aliens, Ufo= Solution? 
A crypto made by an annonymous guy from his bedroom who premined 5% of the total supply, and left never to be heard from again. Yea sure, hundreds of countries will fight over 3mil left over Bitcoin, while a Pedophile sales man has around 0.1% of the total world supply.. or an USB stick forgotten in an attic somewhere with 2% of the world supply.
Other people get suckered in by 10,000% gain, not long after.. will start mentioning "Crypto, Jesus, Holy Water"
"Fiat, Fed, Illuminati, 9/11, Crisis, Inflation, The great depression, Human Obesity"
Honestly, i can´t see how you could be a successful person in life, with such borderline conspiracy talk and egoistical assumptions that you take for granted like you know the solution, the future, and the reasoning.

Here is 2 examples of them being global and dominant currency.

Probability that Bitcoin or any other Crypto becomes "Global Currency" is around 1% 
Probability of it being worth 0, is very low.. people would buy it at 1USD just for the heck of it.. because of nostalgia..
That is if the goverments don´t totally ban it.
But probability Bitcoin being worth 100USD in 2 years is much higher than it being worth 100,000 in 2 years.

 Wow have you really thought through with what you are implying ?
If you are so certain that it wont fall below 2,800, you could just trade every single dip with a stop loss at 2,800.. you would make a fortune
Buy at 7k, take profit at 10k, sl 2,800 
Buy next dip at 7k profit at 10k sl 2,800
Buy a dip at 6k sl 2,800, take profit 10,000
and so on and on, thats not how the markets work sunshine
As easy as it got to 19k,from approx the low of 760 that year.. the same applies on downward moves.

The ratio between transaction of actually buying stuff
Illegal vs legal, bitcoin or any other crypto wins that by a mile! You cant argue with that.
If had a substitute for a different kind of cell phone that makes it harder for doing illegal stuff we would use it but we don´t.

You mean inflation?
Inflation is a good thing, it circulates money.. makes it available for lending and preventing whales to just sit on cash and not circulate the money for a healthy economy.
We could actually make fiat DEFLATIONARY, but that would stop economic progress, new business.
To think that the worlds currency is going to be an anonymous and deflationary, is insanity.. whilst 100 hodlers holding 50% of the 77trillion dollar fiat market.. is i repeat INSANITY.
Its not better, faster, cheaper.
So the fact that the sales of drugs on darknet has gone up by a tenfold since 2010s.. surely wont cause more overdoses and deaths by a stupid thing like drugs..

"That is a matter open for debate."
Central Banks are not evil, they are run by thousands and thousands of people and regulation
"Educated people can be misguided and often wrong."
Yes i agree, but bitcoin hodlers can´t be misguided and wrong.
"Sure, but that's merely a question of acceptance. For example, if I travel I have a far better chance of getting someone to accept bitcoin from me than some random world currency they have no idea how to exchange."
