I think this has been pretty clear for quite some time.  I think we should leave the story behind.  Head to the better exchanges, CoinMKT, VoS (for our Canadian friends) and be done with Gox.

Hiltzkik is the worst.

Unfortunately, you fail to realize that mt.gox isn't bitcoin and the community will continue on without them, cleansed  of their bad behavior.  Investors will be pouring money into exchanges over the next few weeks and the price has already shown resilience.  I'd read up a bit more about bitcoin, the more you know, right?

I'd say Ryan did the community a favor -- that also happened to be advantageous to his new startup.  "blowing the whistle" uncovered objective malfeasance on Gox behalf, does Ryan benefit in the long run?  Maybe.  We'll see.   I do, however, think he's in closer/more regular conversations with the 'inner circle', Ver, Jesse, etc, then he was previously to the release.  And I believe you'll begin to see him toeing the 'company line' in subsequent posts.  He might've gotten capital or access to capital from those guys after his 'leak', which could lead to a less adversarial tone towards the 'in-group' and is kind of a bummer.

Honestly people, move to CoinMKT or VoS.  They're the only transparent options.

Looks like this entire theory is falling apart.

What a great idea. Best of luck to our Dutch brothers and sisters!

Move your business to the US based exchanges and they will have more volume.  Kraken and CoinMKT aren't going anywhere. I trade with CoinMKT as much as I can and their liquidity is improving.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:16:06
I don't understand people like you.
@_date: 2014-03-04 03:13:30
Thank goodness.  We've got room for some of the new exchanges to make advances.
@_date: 2014-02-26 12:52:01
This is yet another reason why I've been slowly increasing my activity on CoinMKT and VoS.

  Not sure if that's correct, but the name is.

This is wildly inaccurate.  There have been safe exchanges in the US for the last six months.  It's was easy to move your coin from mtgox to coinbase.  It's still easy to move from btc-e and stamp to CoinMKT.
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:02:29
Just because buttercoin is backed by google ventures doesn't mean they'll be a more preferable exchange than those that already exist.  
@_date: 2014-03-05 18:52:39
I think you make some great points, especially regarding Gox.  I was recently at a meetup and spoke with someone who'd lost ~$200K due to Gox.  It was first time the rubber met the road for me.  None of the people I usually associate with have had coin/fiat in Gox for months.  It was heartbreaking.  I do think the move to better regulated, transparent exchanges will be helpful, the CoinMKT's and VoS will prove to be much more reliable and useful as they grow.  
I'm sick to death about companies like Trezor or Butterfly Labs.  I'm not sure where the incompetence becomes malevolence on these sham companies behalves, but it needs to stop.  Perhaps we create some kind of Seal of Approval?  I know that's a step away from decentralization, but it's something we might need.
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:08:06
I'm not trying to beat a dead horse, here. But look who in the community is clearly not involved in this cover up: Vault of Satoshi, CoinMKT.  These smaller guys are scrapping and trying to make it honestly while back room deals are happening and the community is being taken advantage of.  Support the honest exchanges!
@_date: 2014-02-24 17:30:53
I'd love to read a blog about this as it happens.  I feel like it's going to get a lot easier as the year progresses, though I'm sure you'll run into your share of roadblocks along he way, as well.  Good luck and keep us updated!
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:01:54
Honestly, that site is pretty inaccurate. But I do think I started using CoinMKT after their early reviews.  
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:56:49
I know Travis of CoinMKT and Jesse of Kraken are legit.  Part of the reason why I trade with CoinMKT is their insistence on being a full reserve exchange.     
@_date: 2014-03-17 15:47:09
Not ready for primetime.
@_date: 2014-03-18 04:24:06
I think this is uncalled for. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:47:27
Sincere condolences. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:01:48
Come on, man.  You sound ridiculous.  The FDIC doesn't print money. Unfortunately, it's quite disconcerting that you were ever part of the leadership of the bitcoin community in the first place.  And I've defended you before.  In public.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:32:45
This is what we've wanted for months. I'm sorry to watch people lose money, but ultimately it's good for bitcoin as a whole.  Buy, buy, buy.
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:42:12
So this means that Jesse Powell is completely off-base, yes? 
@_date: 2014-03-01 03:26:50
Where will your liquidity come from?
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:38:58
You're in the wrong place, friend.  Do some reading then come back.
@_date: 2014-03-18 04:50:01
I'm not sure BTC-E is fraudulent, but their lack of compliance concerns me.  Kraken is impossible to use if you're in the US, despite the claims of their reddit army.  I use coinmkt and I'm happy with them.  At least I know they're not going to go dark/get hacked/disappear. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:09:45
I use Coinbase and Stamp like a lot of people, but I also use CoinMKT.  More people need to support them. They're American and I've never had an issue  that wasn't resolved quickly and politely.  They deserve a little more support and the chance to grow.   I'm all for SecondMarket stepping in, but I'd like to see people get behind the smaller companies too.

Best of luck, the service is certainly needed in Argentina.  Buenos Aires is beautiful!

Finally had a chance to watch this. I'd like to again express my condolences to Erik.  You did right by the community by speaking publicly.  Thanks.
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:22:16
When a man is making Buck Rodgers references in attempt to apply the veneer of science fiction to something in 2014, you know he's out of touch.  God bless the snowball but he's off-base here.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:18:34
Hear, hear.  Cut it out and set it on fire.  Bitcoin is alive and well.
@_date: 2014-02-24 17:55:02
Coinkite is legit.  Great move and I hope other exchanges and wallet services follow suit.
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:30:20
Some, not all will listen.  It's important to engage.
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:04:28
It's quite obvious that Karpeles was in way over his head from the very beginning. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 12:55:08
I concur.  There's a helluva lot of obfuscation from those guys and at this point transparency is what we need both individually and in terms of bitcoin as a whole.  VoS and CoinMKT meet that standard for me right now.  
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:33:17
100% with you.  It had to be done. We've known for months.  Sorry for those who lost money.
@_date: 2014-02-24 03:58:48
this is good news, US exchange does right by US grassroots organizer.  Makes you think what's going to be possible down the road.

"thank you for your patience, we are looking into this issue"
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:11:57
How can this be verified in any exacting measure?
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:20:15
It's pretty obvious.
@_date: 2014-03-06 00:58:43
Cryptsy is ok.  They have persistent problems, but are the only reliable option to trade certain coins. They have good volume too.  I use coinmkt for most alt trading and I've heard they're going to list doge sometime soon. Hopefully! 
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:38:15
Let's relax on the conspiracy theories.  They are truly unbecoming.
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:00:45
Pretty sure that was intentional.

I think this is bigger news than is being let on.  This provides a dependable (in their eyes) way in for institutional investors.  Those of us on the relative inside can scoff, but the fact that bloomberg carried it means the reverberations throughout the institutional community won't be slight.  That said, I'll be sticking with CoinMKT and Vos :)
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:26:53
Love these guys.

A little bird told me that Charlie's been buying up BTC on Gox for the last week...
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:29:48
This is sad news for the many who've lost their coins and fiat.  This is nothing close to the end for what we've all created and believed in.  The incompetence of Mt.Gox does not eliminate the strength of the community.  Toward peace and freedom indeed.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:48:29
Preach!
