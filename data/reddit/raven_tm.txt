It has been since an hour ago.

Just as I thought I could finally breath again after my alts took off.

Any idea which bitcoin would be used for trading alts in case of a fork?

True that. 
I did expect some FUD, but not on Tuesday (didn't expect Bitmain's tweet on Monday last week either. **Everything seems to happen in advance**. +After Monday being very peaceful. 
Woke up at 4 am in the morning CEST and wanted to sell. There was a new video by Tone about the BCC. What he said in the video calmed me down, so I went back to sleep.
Selling started at 7 CEST and I woke up at 9 to see a huge red candle. *"Aah it's okay, we gucci, it's going to recover later"* or so, I'd thought. 
Then the US woke up couple hours later and panic sold their pants. Left me like *"K. Now I HODL"*

I've come to similar conclusions (controversy, speculation).
Jihan signals fake support for SegWit2x, then pulls out last minute, so that miners can cash out and forks alongside the UASF. Takes his ASICs to mine the 'Approved by China' chain. (or ASIC Boost Compatible)

Market manipulation at its finest. 
People who don't follow the news directly, have just only gotten to know about the BCC from a medium post (imo), even though we've known about it since at least Saturday (?).

We, redditors, had known about the BCC for a while and also knew, it was not going to be a big deal. 
Therefore I didn´t sell my FOMO purchase, when BTC Mooned on the 20th. 
But then the public panic sold and now I lost my small recovered profit. 
Wish to have had panic sold like the sheep.

Bitch Cash, then. 


Read a lot of dank memes and it will come as naturally as breathing.

Wow, that must hurt. Condolences. 
Law of averages? Am I going to win a lottery or something? Last 3 years have been shit. Now I got into crypto and the market starts shitting itself. Must be my fault, sorry again.
