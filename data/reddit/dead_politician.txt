I believe you can buy the keys from OP, with Bitcoin. OP then uses the Bitcoin into fiat to buy keys from steam.

Hey, how do your N64 controllers hold up against the original? Me and my bros play N64 and need some new ones.

I'm gonna go with yeah, gf/wife. It sounded like they were talking as "we", "our bill", etc

^too true..

You could say that about a lot of products. Obviously, the "pro's" to bitcoin can only apply to certain things- online bill pay doesn't really gain anything from bitcoin. Rather, it allows people to more thoroughly embrace bitcoin. 
Say you got a paper Dish invoice to pay, and it had a QR code on it to pay in BTC right there. Simple iphone app scan could send your payment in 15 seconds if that, without having to mail a check in, or go online and log in and enter your debit info, etc.

Damn, that's good.

FWIW, all purchases are subject to state tax, even if Amazon is the only online retailer that includes it in your state.

The liability to pay it back to the depositor, yes. But not to keep track of the bill - it's their money now.

Coinbase is over their buy limits for the next week.

Currently my .15 BTC are in my Coinbase account, as I'm probably just going to sell them at a later date through Coinbase. I would leave them there, as you can just transfer them out to whatever exchange you want to sell them on at a later date. Coinbase is fairly secure, I believe.

**EDIT: Not actually true... they use Bitpay.**
I think it's awesome to charge so much less in bitcoin than USD. cheers for that.
@_date: 2013-07-06 15:42:06
Guess you're right, they use Bitpay. That's a shame.

You can, but it's simpler to just either A) keep your coins in whatever exchange you bought them (like CoinBase or whatever), or B) transfer them to an online wallet like commented above. 
This way is just simpler, and arguable less fail-able.

Yeah without a doubt. Try to encourage btc in whatever way possible. But you still have to cover the cost to make it :P

Ugh, this reminds me of when Mt Gox was hacked a while ago. My password and email was leaked, so I came back and deleted my account. Who knows how many bitcoins were in my account.. I was so naive :(
