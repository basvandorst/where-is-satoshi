The funny thing is.. employee is the one who sent the money to the "thief" by mistake. Instead of accepting his mistake and moving on, he doxxed his customer and threatened him publicly. He did all this for $50 ... **FIFTY. FUCKING. DOLLARS.** 
@_date: 2015-04-04 08:23:14
He admitted doing it himself.

How do you know there are 3 buttcoiners/full-time troll for every bitcoiner?
@_date: 2015-04-04 08:28:07
You're joking, right?
@_date: 2015-04-09 14:31:33
And your prove is a screen shot of you downvoting people?
@_date: 2015-04-04 17:10:00
I don't think having two of the largest for-profit bitcoin companies hiring most of the core developers is a wise idea. 
@_date: 2015-04-04 08:01:13


Links to the press release?
@_date: 2015-04-04 17:01:38
Bitcoin, the train-wreck. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 22:56:31
who is he?
@_date: 2015-04-04 08:41:38
1. 3 cents are not free.
2. If you don't pay, you risk getting you transaction stuck for unknown amount of time.
3. it's 3 cents for now. the fee will keep increasing as block rewards halves.
@_date: 2015-04-04 16:56:49
Read his new tweets. He addressed that.
@_date: 2015-04-08 23:33:57
That's what I thought.
@_date: 2015-04-04 08:44:17
I guess you don't realize that my post links to bitcoinfoundation.org post featuring Janssens, himself, admitting to saying those things.
@_date: 2015-04-08 23:00:31

wait, I can't use them like my normal mastercard credicard?
@_date: 2015-03-28 00:23:57
What lies are you talking about?

To the moon!!! ┗(°0°)┛ ^.^.^○
@_date: 2015-03-26 20:56:22
All clear now. Thank you for explaining.
@_date: 2015-03-19 10:59:33
Now it all makes sense.
@_date: 2015-03-09 13:56:40
inb4 all altcoins are scams and a waste of time.
@_date: 2015-03-26 13:11:05


I'm mainly concerned about this. I really can't see how they could make money without sell users info somehow. This is a good blog about the topic.
@_date: 2015-03-26 13:03:57
Mod logs, I guess.
@_date: 2015-03-07 07:18:16
I expect one of CCN writers to post a similar one in the near future.
@_date: 2015-03-27 01:26:59
Nope, this is why I'm not a captain of industry.
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:46:16
This sounds similar to mod who [accepted a job at moolah]( last year to help them build their platform. [That didn't end well](
@_date: 2015-03-03 17:36:47


No way ..
@_date: 2015-03-04 16:39:31
@_date: 2015-03-04 18:47:32
They did talk about shutting down hashtalk though
@_date: 2015-03-05 17:44:20




Yeah, I agree.
@_date: 2015-03-05 07:17:26
I would wait and see what other news sites report. Coinfire.io will probably cover this.
@_date: 2015-03-06 10:10:47
They are Josh Garza's sockpuppets.
@_date: 2015-03-04 16:42:48
How did the end addresses got lost? Cant's they track bitcoins that were sent from customers to MtGox?
@_date: 2015-03-28 13:46:32
Yeah, that's definitely a phishing email. Delete it.
@_date: 2015-03-05 17:46:42
That won't happen, at least officially. Moxie have stated that several times.
@_date: 2015-03-25 22:23:51
You only need green address's seed to get your bitcoins back.
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:55:51
Do you have any proof that Garza is responsible for DDOSing Coin Fire?
@_date: 2015-03-05 17:57:08
I thought it was a Chinese bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2015-03-25 22:12:41
Well, you have nothing to worry about then. Reset the app and type your seed.
@_date: 2015-03-26 20:20:22
Thanks. I just checked greenaddress and it does have nlocktime transaction time for about ~90 days by default. So if your account is locked, you can wait until you receive the signed transaction by email and then use your own seed. Am I right? 
@_date: 2015-03-06 10:17:37
Because he probably didn't use it to tip the barber. He wants OTHERS to send money. 
@_date: 2015-03-04 12:14:06
Is it open-source?
@_date: 2015-03-06 10:21:12


You really think sharing your privatekeys with a third party is a good idea?
@_date: 2015-03-04 19:18:57


any comment?
@_date: 2015-03-07 15:23:41
In theory, yes, but it has been stated many times that a roll back is very unlikely to happen.
@_date: 2015-03-27 09:54:11
Those did come to my mind.
1. 1% fee point was addressed in the article. It's no where sufficient to cover even operational costs.
2. Why would people use changetip if they are going to charge money per off-chain transaction? Bitcoin fees is around 40cents anyways.
3. Charities can accept bitcoin themselves directly or using bitpay. 
4. Outside of signing up and withdrawing bitcoins, no one is using changetip website, they use extensions and bots on other platforms such as reddit or twitter.
5. the rest of ideas can be done using bitcoin directly. Changetip is not needed, especially if they were charging for every off-chain transaction.
@_date: 2015-03-26 13:02:55
That's the default setting though, isn't it?
@_date: 2015-03-28 15:32:19
My bad.
@_date: 2015-03-16 11:08:21
You can scan the same QR- shared secret with another backup device.
@_date: 2015-03-06 09:53:54
So he's also screwing his own sockpuppets. Impressive.
@_date: 2015-03-24 20:09:24
karma points.
@_date: 2015-03-02 00:59:19


Who knows how many are used for commercial transactions? There are thousands of transactions happening each day from mixing services to pure dust.

@_date: 2015-03-05 22:24:43
This sounds reasonable. 
@_date: 2015-03-26 19:50:48
Do you know how?
@_date: 2015-03-06 09:18:31
One for iOS and the other for android. I've read that they both will be called Signal i the future
@_date: 2015-03-06 19:14:18
That won't harm others USD users though. It will only harm your wallet.
@_date: 2015-03-26 22:13:21
hahahahahahaha 
@_date: 2015-03-05 17:49:25


This is a bad idea.
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:48:36
I hope you wrote down your recovery seed for your sake.
@_date: 2015-03-17 02:38:11
Do you use as your personal twitter account?
@_date: 2015-03-02 00:23:24
Are there any major retailers that had an increase in bitcoin sales after the initial "We're accepting bitcoin" PR phase? I'm sure Bitpay and Coinbase would be happy to publish these numbers.
@_date: 2015-03-05 17:35:50




Cool, let's contact other administrators like luke-jr.
