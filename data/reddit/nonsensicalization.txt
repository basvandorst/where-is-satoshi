Electrum's 12-word seeds have 128 bits of entropy and can be memorized quite easily. Since Bitcoin's 256 bit ECC keys have a security margin of only 128 bits themselves, theres is no loss of security. Your point is therefore invalid, unless you can prove that learning 12 words is beyond human capacity.

BIP38 requires possession of a file or physical object, with all the associated downsides (potential loss, theft, destruction). Memorizing 12 words is *easy*, if you can't do it, you can't be trusted to remember where your piece of paper was either.
Try to learn this, it's an original seed, just treat it like a poem:

I agree and as we can see with Bitcoin the local requirements are slowly becoming prohibitive for individuals, and I'm not talking about mining. While Bitcoin can work with the network being run by industrialized clusters, the same is not true for something like BitMessage, at least not without sacrificing the very thing it set out to achieve.

You seem to have the misconception that a brain wallet has to be some stupid self-picked song lyric. Electrum's 12-word seeds have 128bits entropy. A 256bit elliptic curve key has a security margin akin to a 128bit symmetric key. In other words you are not losing any security and the seeds are definitely *not* "virtually impossible" to remember. They are like little, quirky poems, relatively easy to remember actually.

The validity of an address stems only from the matching checksum. Generate a random string, attach the correct checksum and you have a valid address as far as the bitcoin network is concerned.
If the random string is not so random, but obviously a long chosen text, you know anything that gets send to that address is effectively lost/burned.

Given what we now know with certainty, thanks to Snowden, about their doings, I compute the chance that they audit and/or actively sabotage one of the most widely used crypto packages in the world at 100%.
The budget to do so is just spare change to them and the benefit (for them) enormous. Actually the NSA probably knows OpenSSL and other similar programs better than anyone else. Lack of funding to go over each line of code of any high value target with a fine comb is not really one of their problems.

What would a PoW scheme look like that can not possible be implemented more efficiently by entities with deeper pockets? Because that's what the creeping centralization boils down to. Scrypt &amp; Co have shown that they could delay the onslaught of specialized hardware and mining farms, but nothing more.
I think it's not possible to create an algorithm that would actually prevent the ~~centralization~~ clustering of the network **in the long run**, the only benefit of alternative PoWs is for altcoins to prevent being overwhelmed right at the start.
@_date: 2014-08-16 11:13:30


That is *not* a solution to the problem. It merely forces the user with the many virtual nodes to actually provide enough space for each instance, but it doesn't prevent anyone from becoming a massively clustered point of failure.
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:54:34


That's exactly the point though and why I called your earlier statement bullshit. Bitcoin can not function at any valuation because the marketcap must be high enough that all participants can move the value they want at the same time. If the whole network was worth $1 and two people want to transfer a dollar at the same time, it simply doesn't work. Put in higher numbers, same deal.
Hence if Bitcoin's adoption as a means to transfer and store value rises, the valuation must go up, and that's in fact one reason for the logarithmic price increase (speculation being another).
Besides, if Bitcoin takes off like many hope it will, then the need to convert coins to fiat will diminish greatly in time.

FYI noob instructions to verify a signed message:
* Go to a place where you know you are looking at the right person. As Peter mentioned you can go to the Bitcoin github and find his commits, or you can find his twitter account. Whatever you do, make sure the right identity has been established.
* Find the PGP key Id belonging to the identity in question, It looks like this: 0x7FAB114267E4FA04 (this is Peter's key, but don't just trust me, verify yourself).
* Import the key into your keyring: "gpg --recv-keys 0x7FAB114267E4FA04"
* Save the whole message from "-----BEGIN" to "SIGNATURE-----"
to a text file, e.g. todd.txt.
* Verify the signature: "gpg --verify todd.txt"
It will tell you:
    gpg: Signature made Fr 13 Jun 2014 12:41:19 CEST using RSA key ID A5F091FB
    gpg: Good signature from "Peter Todd &lt;pete
    gpg:                 aka "[jpeg image of size 5220]"

The NSA or some other government outfit slaps you with an order to spike the Spideroak client with a subtle modification which makes it send all the private keys. The modification is so cleverly obfuscated by the admirably smart NSA code wizards and the output encrypted that it will probably go unnoticed even if somebody were to reverse engineer your binary blobs. Of course it's all served alongside a lifelong gag order that prohibits you from even thinking about said order in the "privacy" of your own head. Can't even talk to your lawyer about this, no ma'am, this is the land of the free surveillance state after all.

No, a client runs locally on your machine, a web wallet like blockchain.info is running on some web server. You have to trust them not to screw you, trust them about their security, trust they don't get shut down tomorrow.
By using their service you are adding another point of failure to the system and more possibilities to fail inevitably mean a higher chance to fail. Using a local client is not a guarantee that nothing will go wrong, but you eliminate some dangerous variables and I argue that the benefit of using a web wallet does not outweigh the added risks.

I've looked into Bote although documentation is relatively scarce. It seems do to get the important cornerstones right: pubkey as address, redundant DHT storage, 100 day retention and I2P's inherent anonymous connectivity. Technically it's above and beyond Bitmessage and virtually the only real contender I have found for a large scale secure messaging service.
I personally don't care much if it has a shiny interface or not, but as a matter of fact a prettier/easier setup could go a long way to help I2P and Bote gain a wider audience. And that's ultimately important, the best and most secure solution is worth very little when nobody is using it.
Seeing that the easy interface and installation are the only things Bitmessage has going for it, maybe Bote could benefit from some facelifting and a fool proof setup package (just bare bones I2P with Bote preconfigured) to appeal to the masses.

The argument being made for scrypt is often that asics effectively centralize mining because Joe Average can't participate anymore with his gpu.
I doubt that line of thought because if bitcoin had scrypt it would at some point be profitable to actually build asics for that, they would just be way more expensive than sha asics and thus Joe would even be less likely to get one.
No scrypt asics have materialized (yet?) because none of the altcoins have any volume to speak of and they are most likely all doomed to fail. Yes, litecoin too, it solves none of bitcoin's fundamental design problems.

@_date: 2013-08-10 11:05:08
It's not. The underlying principles can't work on a large scale because the associated storage, bandwidth and computation requirements are prohibitive even with clustering.
Some of the design ideas are outright stupid, like trying to decrypt *every* message to find one meant for you. Sure, that works with some thousand users, but not with millions sending a gazillion mails every day. I wish Bitmessage was the solution, but I'm afraid it's not.

My security guide:
* Educate yourself.
* Be smart.
* Don't be stupid.
* Get some fucking common sense.
* "Thank you kind sir, your insights saved my bitt!"
* "I shall name my firstborn *nonsensicalization*."
This advice is **on sale for free**, down from its regular price of one gazillion satoshis.
Thank you and enjoy!

If you are talking about SpiderOak, yes, all they know is how much data you have stored, all encryption is done locally, the keys never leave your computer. But you should use an encrypted wallet anyway.

The very worst things a malicious Electrum server could do is a) not transmit your transactions to the network and b) hide transactions from you. edit: Both are not really profitable things to do for an attacker.
They can **not** forge transactions or steal your coins.

Don't rely on a single backup. Put a copy online for safeguard against theft/destruction. Check out SpiderOak for continuous, encrypted online backups.

The seed requires nothing else to recover the wallet, it can't be lost, destroyed or taken away. Not memorizing it and putting it into an encrypted database means there is now a file that has to be protected and is prone to all of the above conditions.
An *additional* encrypted backup is certainly a good idea, but memorizing the seed is an absolute must.

Why is it so much lower on Bitfunder? Considerably smaller userbase?
General thoughts about btctco vs. bitfunder? After looking around on both I can only say that I don't particularly like the external handling of funds on bitfunder via weexchange. When I went to [that site]( I thought "I'm supposed to give *that* my money?".

From a myopic viewpoint those changes might be seen as "innovations", but they are merely slight modifications of the disruption that was Bitcoin. They are *not* in and of themselves innovative, they did *not* open hitherto unknown possibilities, they do *not* have anywhere near the impact Bitcoin has.

And for symmetric schemes we can increase the key sizes to counter such advances. My point was merely that simply doing the 2^256 math is pointless as far as future proof security is concerned.


That's why I added "today's commonly used". Still, post-quantum crypto is a relatively young field and at this point we can only hope that a viable scheme sees widespread use in time.
@_date: 2013-09-05 20:19:12
It is my understanding that the Bitcoin protocol itself does not rely on any PRNG algorithm. Bitcoin *clients* use RNGs though for the generation of private keys and for the signing process, *if* a flawed algo were to be used by your client you would be in trouble (see the Android debacle for reference).

This *would be* a valid point in a market that can actually grow, because if the market grows as a whole your fixed percentage is worth more. **The amount of mined bitcoins per time frame is fixed** though, any temporary growth is quickly stopped by the difficulty increase, thus the mining is fundamentally a market that can not grow.
In other words the growing power of other parties only makes it more difficult and costly to keep the same percentage share. It's not like AM's hardware selling business is such a giant gig either, they sold only very little hardware (compared to the overall network hashrate, including their own) and at outrageous prices.
Their gen1 blades were ridiculously overpriced and the usb eruptors are just toys, which will never see ROI. I think their hardware sales added very little competition for them and the prices they could ask because of their quasi-monopoly made more than up for that.
**tl;dr** I don't think so.
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:31:16
Yeah, it's easy to look at the old money and think you have missed the best entry point. As far as the possible future development and adoption of bitcoin is concerned we are all early adopters, even now. Holding just one single btc means you will be positioned better than most other people should bitcoin *really* take off.

Simply recognizing the trend after the fact just doesn't cut it when you have a significant stake in the speculation game. Sure, predictions can be wrong, but they can also make a ton of profit or save an investment. Don't want to speculate on the price? Ignore the predictions.

Actually Canonical has officially teamed up with the "Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People's Republic of China" to create an Ubuntu spin named UbuntuKylin.
[UbuntuKylin homepage (english version)](
Apart from the default Chinese input it features local news, weather, search and so on. Since this is government supported it might actually gain some traction. China has long been trying to get people away from their pirated Windows versions, they don't really trust the American black box... and I can't blame them.

Fails to address an important point: the network is currently limited to a maximum of 7 transactions per second and to raise that limit the block size needs to go up.
*Not* raising that limit is simply not an option because 7 tps is ridiculously low. IMHO the block size should be increased rather sooner than later, before the network hits that roadblock at full speed.
@_date: 2013-08-17 15:44:44
Stupid oversimplification, because...
1. Some yet unforeseeable advance in technology and/or cryptanalysis might make contemporary encryption an object of ridicule in the future (every obsolete scheme being a testament to that)
2. Flaws in encryption algorithms bring down the required computing power to a fraction of the theoretical maximum
3. Attacks only get better over time and every well researched encryption scheme has shown weaknesses of varying degree (except OTP, which is impractical)
4. Quantum Computing will kick today's commonly used asymmetric encryption (like Bitcoin's ECC) to the curb within the next decades, this is not even speculation
In other words thinking your 256bit encryption can't be cracked during the lifetime of our sun is supremely shortsighted and shows a lack of understanding. There are already theoretical attacks on AES, they are currently impractical because they require enormous resources, but the mark has been made.
