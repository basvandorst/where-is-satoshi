This is patently false. There are other ways of dealing with bad actors in the space- such as boycotting and refusing to participate. Which is exactly what majority of the crypto space is already doing. 
And who gets to define what "fraud" actually means in this case? *The Government*. Bitcoin is not a brand name and Ver owns the domain. So why give your power over to the government to jurisdict matters they know nothing about and have no business regulating to begin with?

You need to go for a walk or reprogram your subconscious or something bro because you are freaking out over nothing. The overwhelming majority of bitcoin's price direction is decided by margin traders and they will already know this information before everyone else and short accordingly if/when it's meaningful enough.

Ever heard of the phrase "buy the rumor, sell the news"? People often ask "I don't get it. The long awaited release came out and price dumped! It doesn't make any sense!" Well, it doesn't make sense but also doesn't need to here, it's just the way it is. 
Similarly- Bad news is a short signal, good news is a long signal. Traders are basically always trying to make profit and don't gaf about the sentiment or ultimate price of bitcoin or whether it makes sense or is morally commendable.


And what I explained applies to every example. You are confusing cause and effect. The news causes the selloff because it's a short signal. By the time "negative perception" reaches the layman the market is already down and the news is old. And ironically enough, the time frame you are referencing when all those events happened is precisely when Kobayashi market sold tremendous amounts of BTC, lol, which proves my point I made from the very beginning. The masses have very little sway over the price of BTC and it was the massive sell orders that began the downward momentum.

Margin trading means you are basically loaning capital you don't own, and that has to come from someone. In this case you are borrowing from other traders and have to pay funding at certain time intervals. In bitmex it's every 8 hours for instance. Funding payout varies depending on a few factors, one of which is total longs vs. shorts. There were many long positions compared to shorts and so longs had to pay shorts funding.
Funding plays out in different ways depending on the duration before the payout, overall market conditions, etc. When someone sees dwindling volume, price hitting major resistance level, and such a big funding payout, it makes sense to switch to short to ride the inevitable downward movement while profiting a free .375% just for being short.
Many people don't understand this aspect of bitcoin price and it could be said that margin trading is unhealthy for bitcoin. But it could also be said that it adds volatility, which is opportunity.
As for the 'bull run'- almost everyone actively trading knows that the price spike from 6700 to 8k was entirely due to whale groups liquidating shorts. They could just as easily dump on the market at any time.
@_date: 2018-04-21 06:01:41
I tried explaining this exact concept to someone who was trying to shill his bitmex affiliate link. 
It's very difficult to time the market. 
For what it's worth, however, if you follow the emotional market cycle we haven't quite hit despair/depression yet and could still possibly fall to 5k. This is more the denial phase. What follows should be panic, capitulation, anger, then despair.

You are stuck in confirmation bias and are ignorant of the true driving forces of market direction. Go margin trade on bitfinex and bitmex for a few years and you will understand that 95% of price direction is determined by a few groups with the most capital. 
For instance you probably had no idea that this recent drop from 9700 was caused primarily by funding. Longs had to pay shorts .375%, which is huge, and gave incentive for longs to close position and shorts to open up to collect the funding.
It barely matter if a few dudes on reddit tether their .5 BTC. Holders are going to hold. Bears would already be short. Margin allows millions upon millions of BTC to drive price direction, and liquidations fuel the fire once a direction is set.

Not necessarily. A single market sell order of 16,000 BTC will liquidate countless positions, and trigger even more stop losses. It has very little to do with emotion and in fact is all automated. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 10:31:31
So this is your confirmation bias, as I've already stated. You are selecting only parts of what happened but assembling it in ways that support your argument which wouldn't work if you took all the pieces. Let's look at the unfoldment of the binance hack movement as it actually occurred:
- binance gets hacked
- margin traders are alerted of the event and close large long positions and open shorts
- stop losses are triggered, driving price down further 
- large positions start liquidating, driving price down much further and faster
- longs are squeezed and very large positions on low leverage are forced to close parts of their position or hedge by entering shorts 
- market momentum is strongly downward and traders who closed longs now enter shorts.
By the time this happens, the price has already moved significantly. Only now do redditors catch news of the event, make posts and say "aha! So this is the FUD that dumped the market!" "Stop panic selling guys!!" Etc etc.
Lol. They are barely involved with the price movement. Only at this stage does Johnny finally tether his .5 BTC in capitulation (and probably five minutes before the price rebounds anyway).
