Assuming this was an e-mail, are you 100% sure this is a legitimate Coinbase e-mail? My fear would be it's a phishing e-mail that will collect your passwords as you log onto the fake site (assuming there's a link in the e-mail)

the next thing I'd be worried about is that your coins are all still where you left them.
Not that I'm paranoid or anything...

This will be the second time this has happened, yes?
I'm just thinking the people who were prone to sell would have done the last time. Each time this happens the effect will be smaller (in theory at least)

Revolut - app/card promises to allow you to store money in Bitcoin. To unlock the feature right now you can invite 3 people or pay ~7 euro a month.
If you want to help me out at the same time as signing up you can use my link:

I used my credit card when I bought bitcoin. Then I paid it off immediately.
[I'm in the UK, buying from the US and my Credit Card has a better exchange rate than my debit card and probably better protection too]

I think if you can afford it, go for it. If you believe in the technology and the purpose behind it and even the novelty factor of owning some then do it.
It may not massively appreciate, you might lose some, you might end up spending it on a couple of pizzas, who knows.
I'd suggest taking a little bit of that and getting some ethereum as well. Apparently Coinbase will be adding that to their offering soon which could make the price go up.

Revolut is a pre-paid card that allows payment to crypto exchanges. 
If you used my link to join you'd be doing me a massive favour as well.

I bought my fraction of a bitcoin with a credit card. I was buying on a US site from the UK. Using my credit card provided a much better USD/GBP exchange rate than my debit card and no fees.
I also think my credit card may afford me more protection if the exchange tried to do a runner without sending me my bitcoin.
I then paid off my credit card in full within the hour.
I guess a money transfer is another option, but I was in a rush and wanted to buy a dip. The price was already rising.
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:04:21
I think that's the change in value since the day before. I.e 1 bitcoin costs 20 dollars less than at close of business yesterday.

I think you need to understand how it works, or why it could be a game-changer, to make fair and nuanced articles either way.
The whole article just reads as a rant.

Well if you look at the financial crisis in Venezuela as an extreme example of a financial crisis, crypto seems to be booming over there.
In times of strife rich people usually put more money into gold, or art. Investments they expect to stay stead or even appreciate.
Another thing I noticed was the increasing number of bookmakers and pawn shops on the high street. Bookmakers always do well in a recession because you suddenly have more people surviving paycheck to paycheck (if they've even got a job) and they just need that 1 big win to see them alright (the 1 big win never comes, or gets bet again)
So my suggestions would be a lot of money going into bitcoin as it has properties a lot like gold, but also a lot of money going into bitcoin because to a lot of people it's a gamble- they'll be gambling that bitcoin will go up and they can afford to pay their bills.

So... which is the safest world currency in the world right now in your opinion?

That may be an option but as a poor(ish) person, it seems intimating unless there's a safe way to buy small amounts?

This looks a lot like Revolut.
On Revolut you can convert your money into bitcoin, but you never actually own that bitcoin (i.e. you can't send it to anyone, or keep it in a wallet)
You can pay with bitcoin or several fiat currencies on your card.

Brewdog do an 'equity for punks' scheme where you can invest in Brewdog and get perks - money off in their bars etc.
You can genuinely invest in Brewdog using cryptocurrency. This isn't a joke. Invest using crypto and you get a pack of the six beers pictured.
The cans themselves are a bit tongue in cheek/ironic but that is brewdog's style.

I always assumed the blockchain tech would be private.
i.e. They've back up your transaction data on computers in their bank in London, New York, Singapore etc etc so if one computer got hacked or manipulated the others would be fine.
So a much smaller blockchain than bitcoin..

Don't forget that some mining operations will situate themselves where the electricity is cheap or free.
Basically, using electricity that would go to waste if not used for mining.
I believe Iceland is a good option for miners. They have geothermal energy, and it's cold.

One argument in bitcoin's favour is the scarcity. We know there'll only ever be ~21 million.
Gold is scarce too. One estimate is that only ~3 olympic swimming pools of it has ever been mined.
It'll probably never happen but if a mining company finds a massive seam of gold or a golden meteorite gets mined in earth's orbit then it could change the picture entirely.

I'm also not drinking (since Jan 1st) and the way I'm seeing things is if I lose a bit of money through bitcoin so be it.
Since I'm a social binge drinker* I'm saving tonnes of money at the moment.
*I only drink when I'm out in bars and they're all expensive round here. I'm a binge drinker because that fifth drink seems like a really good idea at the time.

I've got most of my crypto on a cold wallet. Also got some on Revolut.
The idea being, if I need some cash quickly I can walk up to the cashpoint and withdraw it within 10 mins.
Not the same as having a dedicated crypto debit card and definitely not an alternative to having a ledger or a trezor.

Gold wouldn't be as valuable if it wasn't scarce. If bitcoin is going to be 'digital gold' it is one important value.

I think a takeaway from some of the replies is that your nephew could have used another wallet. Depending on the amount of money and how serious your nephew is about crypocurrencies, in the future a good gift idea may be a ledger or trezor hardware wallet.

I believe in the technology. I believe there's a need for decentralised systems like this where probably the majority of people don't have a bank account.
I live in the UK and I don't trust my government to run our economy effectively. Austerity has slowed our growth to less than any comparable countries. We're leaving Europe and that's going have a negative effect on the value of the money I own.

I'm in the UK and first bought bitcoin with Coinmama, 'cos you can pay with card and that seemed quickest.
If you get revolut you can store some cash as bitcoin. You can't transfer it or anything, but once you're signed up to an exchange you can convert your 'bitcoin' back to fiat to buy some you actually control.
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:34:24
how much can you afford to lose?
@_date: 2018-02-16 12:29:34
I'm in UK and I've been waiting months for a Tenx Card. Monaco is supposed to be launching soon.
I do have a revolut card. You can store your fiat as bitcoin on there, you can use the app to convert it back to fiat as and when you need to, with a 1.5% fee I think. -not ideal, but I like the way you can store money in other currencies than sterling as well.
@_date: 2018-03-08 01:39:20
It does seem to be a close call between both. The deciding factor for me (nano S owner, no regrets) would probably be which one can I buy/get delivered the quickest, assuming I already own some coin somewhere.

I know it's not really bitcoin but I'm going to sporadically turn it back into fiat to buy some bitcoin.

I've got a ledger.
I think my advice to anyone who's already got coins, or is ready to buy a dip - buy whichever one will arrive first from your preferred vendor.
i.e. If the ledger is out of stock, get a trezor, and vice-versa.
You don't want your coins going missing while you wait for your wallet and as well as security, you're paying for peace of mind. You can relax as soon as you've got your coins safe.

It's a really new technology. Compare it to e-mail or the internet - at first it was only a few computer scientists using it and people said it would never take off. Why would you send an e-mail if you can write a letter or phone that person?
Fast forward to now and we're all carrying around our e-mails in our pocket. Cryptocurrencies have the potential to grow so that almost everyone will be using them. We may even have a future where people don't even realise they're using cryptocurrencies, it's become so engrained in the payment systems in apps etc.
So we have all this potential for growth so I would say buy some. Buy $50 - in the long term you won't miss it. If you can afford to buy a bit more and you don't mind the risk then do so. Become an early adopter, like the rest of us, and see where that $50 is in five years time. The worst case is you've lost $50.
Bitcoin is only worth what people think it is, so the risk is that it's in fashion at the moment and in five years time it's gone the way of myspace and everyone's moved to facebook. I don't think that's that likely as people trust bitcoin as it's basically tamper proof. A lot of other coins have fallible humans in charge of them.

As an aside, I've read  plenty of speculation North Korea has been mining loads of bitcoin.
