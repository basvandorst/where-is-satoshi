Yeah, I hate the forced narrative that ignores the freedom companies have to pay higher wages. Similarly, the "tax cuts screw grad students" narrative by making tuition waivers taxable ignored the possibility that universities could simply pay them more to compensate. The conversation was "Republicans are taking money from poor grad students" when it was such a great opportunity to highlight how embarrassingly underpaid most grad students are, and that's a choice universities are making. Anyway...

[Wallet]( A Bitcoin wallet is a collection of private keys but may also refer to client software used to manage those keys and to make transactions on the Bitcoin network. 
[Address]( A Bitcoin address, or simply address, is an identifier of 26-35 alphanumeric characters, beginning with the number 1, 3 or bc1 that represents a possible destination for a bitcoin payment.

Friend, that quote is a description of money creation in the fractional reserve theory of banking.  The paper I linked considers that theory along with two other theories of banking (the financial intermediation theory of banking and the credit creation theory of banking).  It outlines what the effect of issuing a loan would have on a banks balance sheet in each of the three cases.  He then obtains a loan from a cooperating bank which gave him access to their internal accounting, so that he could actually observe the real effect on their balance sheets.  His observations are consistent with one of the above theories of banking and they contradict the other two.  The conclusion is that the theory which is consistent with the observed data is true while the other theories are false.
This approach to separating fact from fiction is called the [scientific method](
Of course, the observed reality, that banks create credit out of thin air upon creating a loan, allows for the possibility that the banking system creates *even more* money collectively.  See, so your quote is not "the other side" in any sense.  It is certainly not the whole story, as has been shown empirically.
All that said, I'm beginning to understand that the real root of our apparent disagreement is some critical thinking handicap (or, perhaps simple laziness) on your part.  I get the feeling that you are happy with your mistaken but comfortable belief in your own expertise.  And, at the end of the day, I'm fine with that.

Oh, the irony of you suggesting is my echo chamber given that it is in that we are having this discussion...  I guess it would technically be dramatic irony since you seem not to be aware of it.
As far as "do some research" is concerned, I did.  If you scroll up a couple of posts, you can remind yourself of that.  It's the comment starting with "Hey, so, your responses led me down a rabbit hole".  The "rabbit hole" was research.  I turned up additional scholarly journal articles, an academic lecture, a relevant discussion on and a summary bulletin from the Bank of England.
All of those references are making cut-and-dry statements.  And, if they don't do it for you, here's another, written by Standard &amp; Poor's Chief Global Economist and Head of Global Economics and Research:
with this choice quote from page 7:


Friend, I think it might be time for you to slow down, breathe, and take a hard look in the mirror.  I am the one doing research and citing my claims.  You are the one dismissing what I'm saying without evidence or claiming that these things are unknowable.  Could it be that you are the one with something to learn about economics?
@_date: 2019-11-05 22:50:04
I'm not confusing anything, just providing you with some helpful references in the event that you would like to understand the truth of the issue.  Of course, you are right that central banks (or the Treasury) literally print physical currency.  Such currency only accounts for a few percent of the total money supply.  Almost all of the rest of the global money supply is bank credit, which is created out of thin air when a bank approves a loan.
Here's another great reference on the topic written in 2013 by Standard &amp; Poor's Chief Global Economist and Head of Global Economics and Research:
which includes the following relevant statement at the top of page 7:


Edit:  If it is reassuring to you at all, here is a thread from some years ago over in where many people seem to be confused about the issue in similar ways to you.  It might be informative to read through it:

Hey dude, I've spent some time looking into this more deeply (re-read the paper I linked and other more recent papers on the topic). It turns out the conclusion of the paper, that individual commercial banks create money out of nothing when they issue a loan (and that this money accounts for the overwhelming majority of the global money supply), is true. This fact is proven experimentally through cooperation with a real-world bank in the paper I originally linked and the author proved it again in an experimentally cleaner context using the banks' own internal accounting software:
And, if you're the type that would rather hear it from an "authoritative" source rather than just see the data, here is a quarterly bulletin from the Bank of England stating the same conclusion:
Anyway, I know backing up my argument with facts doesn't usually do anything in online arguments but, in the off chance you are actually interested in the truth of the matter here, I thought I'd follow up.

I chose a paper that described an experiment that produced data that proves a theory.
My experience upon learning the freedom regular banks have in creating money for themselves was shock. I had a hard time accepting it because it was such a departure from my preconceptions about how money and lending works. I am a scientist and found this paper to be irresistibly compelling because of their empiracal approach. The paper isn't arguing an opinion, they ran a test, collected data, and published the result.
I posted the link repeatedly because false claims like "banks don't create money" are posted repeatedly. Saying the truth repeatedly, with a reference to back me up, doesn't make me a zealot. If only people were interested in learning something rather than defending their comfortable notion that they understand this stuff already, I'm sure we could have a productive conversation! Read the paper, tell me where their methods are questionable. Quit with the *ad hominem* crap.

Banks get their "product" for free (or nearly free) from the central bank. They don't have to load it on trucks or refine it. In fact, their product is IOUs backed by the labor of the American people. They then loan it back to the American people (and others) at a premium, creating money for themselves in the process. If that wounds like "fundamentally the same" as other industries to you I contend it is your understanding which is "fucked". Here's a fun article from 2013 which discusses how the financial sector's share of *all corporate profits in America* rose to 30% over several decades:
Imagine that. These guys selling us our own money pay themselves **30% of all the money made by all corporations in America**. Is that a fair price for the services they provide? Again, I suggest that you might be wrong about which of us needs to "do better".

I appreciate that you believe you understand banking and how money is created and so have a hard time accepting that individual banks create money when they make loans.

Now, let's see, I am trying to address what I believe to be an error in your understanding of how banks and money work by providing you a link to a scholarly paper on the topic. Meanwhile, you are aggressively attacking my character and dismissing my arguments without rationally engaging with them. You say the topic is "soft" to dismiss my ability to make concrete claims while also making "hard" declarations of your own ("only central banks print money").
I understand there is probably no way I could influence your thinking but I do wish you could slow down for a second and realize that you're the one being the ass here. It can be uncomfortable encountering new information that one's old worldview isn't up to explaining. But, it is only by experiencing such discomfort that we can "grow up".

Corruption harms individuals and their families, too.  Who is to say that exposure like Wikileaks publications don't reduce harm overall?  If the governments of the world were honest and could be held accountable, it wouldn't fall to journalists to make that judgement.  The harm that results from exposing corruption is the fault of the corrupt, not those that expose them.

Perhaps, but it's harder for me to see how that might emerge (at least without many violent revolutions). The fun aspect of the future I'm imagining is that it might just evolve out of the current system, naturally (although not without resistance, I'm sure).
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:10:52

That's the beauty of it (potentially): they might not realize until it's too late. I believe that there is already an Internet nation and you and I are already citizens. You might live in Asia, I might live in Europe, but we're both proud members of various associations on the internet, we use and care about the infrastructure of the internet, we rally in defense of outside attempts to take away or alter our internet. The real power of this new nation has not yet been tested. But, when the vested powers of today try to take our bitcoin or turn off our internet, there will be a response. By that time those things happen, the power of the internet might be too great for old powers to repel.
Edit: And, by "take our bitcoin", I mean, for example, try to censor the bitcoin network. I realize nobody can guess my private keys.

When a transaction is broadcast to your peers, it is added to the peers' "list of valid transactions that have not yet been included into a block", which is called the mempool.  The peers then broadcast it to their peers, etc such that, in short order (seconds?) all nodes' mempool looks about the same, including the miners', who then select one blocks worth transactions from the mempool in their block calculations (those with the highest fees).  It is only when some miner does this calculation that is a function of the mempool and gets some very unlikely result characterized by the Bitcoin difficulty, which is adjusted every two weeks to keep the average block time close to 10 minutes.  For a confirmation to happen, one of these unlikely block calculation results that took your transaction, which has been kicking around between nodes as part of the mempool, as an arguement.  Each subsequent block is a function of all prior blocks, so each subsequent block is a function of your broadcast being selected once-upon-a-block ago. It is the confirmation that gives security because the block calculation work can't be falsified (as far as anyone knows).  The mempool, however, can, in principle, be manipulated.  Someone could be trapped inside a fake network, run by some bad actor, who could present the victim with a fake mempool environment cheaply.  On the other hand, the blockchain cannot be forged (as far as anyone knows), so, the only way a bad actor could create a false blockchain environment to a node would be to calculate a sequence of super-unlikely results of their own (i.e., have more computing power than the rest of the network).  In the present thread, people are suggesting that zero confirmation acceptance is nothing to worry about but it probably will be in the future, at least.  While it's hard to quantify how likely you are to be tricked someday by some bad actor somehow falsifying nodes' mempool, it is easy to quantify how expensive it would be for some would-be bad actor to falsify the blockchain, starting at a given starting block in the past.  In the same way, a confirmation gives a calculable measure of security against fraud.  No such strong statement can be made about the mempool.

Let's say you and I are members of a club with, say, 8 other members. We'd like to vote for a leader. The treasurer sends all 10 club members 1 BTC each to an address they publicly own with which to vote (it could be 1 microBTC, or whatever makes sense). The members then send their coin to the member they wish to vote for. The member with the highest balance wins. There are any number of more clever schemes than this. I just wanted to illustrate how bitcoin = trustless, fraud-proof voting out-of-the-box. Do you understand now?

Hey man, I hear you. I can see I got a little lost in the semantics of the argument. At the beginning of this discussion, I certainly didn't intend to question the integrity of any individual marines, although, rereading what I wrote, I can see how I might have come across that way. My original statement that every man is someone with an agenda that is not necessarily aligned with the interests of America is strictly true. That isn't to say that there are *no* people with agendas aligned with the interests of America. My point was that making this statement about Julian Assange amounts to no statement at all. Of course he's a man with some agenda; we all are! You joined the discussion by suggesting something along the lines of "if I'd ever met a marine, I would understand that their agendas are aligned with the interests of America". I shared the wiki of Smedley Butler to illustrate that the objectives of the marines (as a group) have historically *not* been aligned with the interests of "America" but rather moneyed interests within America. I did not mean to suggest that each marine understood that. In fact, I'm sure most were sincere in their patriotism and would be sickened to know that their discipline and loyalty were exploited by their superiors, as major general Butler was. I know I came across like a prick and for that I am sorry. That said, I think it is necessary to separate the commitment and integrity of individual soldiers from the behaviors and motivations of the military as an organization. The military is run by corruptible human beings and, as Butler's account suggests, corrupt they have often been. It is not in the best interest of America to never question their motives.
@_date: 2018-04-22 23:15:55
I believe the correct response here is to introduce you to United States Marine Corps major general and Medal of Honor recipient (edit: make that *two* Medals of Honor!) Smedley Butler:
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:35:46
... Every single man that ever lived is "a man with an agenda that isn't necessarily beneficial to America". Including the assholes running America!
@_date: 2018-04-24 23:48:36
The present question is whether or not those thousands' agendas were necessarily aligned with the interests of America. This "one marine" (who held the highest possible rank within the marines and thus presumably had better perspective on other marines' agendas than you or me) suggested that this was not typically the case. If I'm understanding your response correctly, you're suggesting that marines who served, fought and died necessarily did so for something honorable. That is called [begging the question]( The testimony of major general Smedley suggests you're wrong.

I think you're wrong. In the long run, as the block reward tends towards zero, the entire mining economy will have to be supported by transaction fees. It is important that the mempool be full enough to make mining profitable at a scale that sufficiently secures the network.
@_date: 2019-05-25 21:29:11
It's up to the miner's what transactions to include. In the early days of Bitcoin, zero fee transactions were very common.
E.g.:

You can use an escrow service like [bitrated.com]( to do an exchange with anyone (including the folks saying "send me the money and I'll send you the btc!" in this thread) with little to no risk.  Set up the trade on bitrated then, after the counterparty pays $5 worth of BTC to the escrow account, send a $5 bill to them through certified mail.  When they receive the money, they should release the BTC to you.  But, even if they don't, you could then escalate to arbitration and show the proof that you mailed it and the arbitrator will release the BTC to you.
@_date: 2019-05-25 23:43:04
I do not see where the linked site says anything about what fee level gets the next block? It is just data about the set of transactions in the mempool, as far as I can tell. Am I missing something? I acknowledge that the estimates in my link are derived, in part, from data about the population of the mempool but I do not see any estimate clearly stated in your link.
@_date: 2019-05-25 23:46:13
Yeah, it wouldn't be in the miners' best interests to include low fee transactions when there are higher fee transactions in the mempool.

I use the following to pull the current Coinbase.com sell price (including fees):
    function GetSellPrice() {
      SpreadsheetApp.flush();
      var d = new Date();
      var aUrl =  "
      var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(aUrl); // get feed
      var dataAll = Utilities.jsonParse(response.getContentText());
      SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getRange('USDperBTC').setValue(dataAll.total.amount);
      return 0;
    }
Where 'USDperBTC' is the name of the cell in which I want the current sell value to appear.  To create this function, just go to 'Tools-&gt;Script editor', paste the code and save.  Using the current time as an unused argument ensures that the value is updated automatically once per minute.

Because they'd lose money. In fact, on average, people mining now are spending more on electricity to run their computers than they're earning through mined bitcoins. The system is structured to reward superior computing power up to some point of diminishing returns. Perhaps someone more knowledgeable than I can elaborate.
