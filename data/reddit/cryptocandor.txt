$900ish. Serious dip after the SEC didn’t approve the Winklevoss EFT attempt. Probably 2 years ago now.

Man you’re really going out of your way to disagree with me. With all of the variations of rationale you can come up with for you presumptions of me, you can’t for the life you see a scenario in MAYBE my point rings true? Agree to disagree. Have a wonderful evening.

Are you a female? No. So I would say you have not personally experienced being spoken down to by someone with equal education because your a female. You haven’t been brushed off when made valid points or input at a job because the men had a better idea. Equal education does not always equate to equal treatment.

Right. Because personal biases or egos never ever play role in decision making. And personal biases and egos have never prevented people from receiving deserved positions or promotions. Please stop mansplaining to me something you haven’t experienced and thus know very little about.

You are right. Bitcoin doesn’t care about gender, but the groups of people helping the development of bitcoin or attempting to better the crypto community do care as females are very under represented in STEM positions. She is skilled, and she accomplished but because she is a female and managed to find herself in that position is also something that should be recognized. It’s not the definitive reason she should be, but it contributes to the accomplishment.

As a female in the crypto space I can say my presence here isn’t any more or less important than someone else just bc I am a female. But this woman should be recognized for her high ranking role and accomplishments as a female considering there ARE less high ranking women in tech. It is harder to get a job in this field.

Idiocy won’t be tolerated lol.

No I’m stating recognize her for accomplishments but also realize her being a women in the STEM field is also an accomplishment in itself. No one stops anyone from applying for any position, doesn’t mean they’re going to get hired.

He’s not only a racist but an ill informed, conspiracy theorist spreading false information.

He responded didn't he? Of course there are going to be things he cannot discuss. He said ask me anything, he didn't say "I'll respond to absolutely everything."
