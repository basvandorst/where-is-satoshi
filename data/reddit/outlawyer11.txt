The signal from all the noise is that Bitcoin making network news has brought forth the gold rushing idiots who have no idea what they're doing, are quick to scare, and are mostly just an anchor. How Bitcoin deals with a mass influx of laypeople who cannot get out of their own way will dictate what happens in the immediate future. People forget that most people are idiots about fiat currency as well.

The price will eventually rise. But this was foolish of you, and let it be a lesson that you shouldn't really be investing in anything until and unless you develop better impulse control and can separate what you can afford to lose from what you cannot. What is the point of emergency fund, for example, if you do not have access to it during an emergency? Come on now. Look at the most recent posts you made before this in your post history. Ain't nothing in life hit you in the face harder than the blowback from hubris

The finest example of Poe's Law ever observed in the wild 
@_date: 2018-03-07 01:23:38
From the California Penal Code: 
**Any sheriff, undersheriff, or deputy sheriff, employed in that capacity, of a county, any chief of police of a city or chief, director, or chief executive officer of a consolidated municipal public safety agency that performs police functions, any police officer,** employed in that capacity and appointed by the chief of police or chief, director, or chief executive of a public safety agency, of a city, any chief of police, or police officer of a district, including police officers of the San Diego Unified Port District Harbor Police, authorized by statute to maintain a police department, any marshal or deputy marshal of a superior court or county, any port warden or port police officer of the Harbor Department of the City of Los Angeles, or any inspector or investigator employed in that capacity in the office of a district attorney, **is a peace officer.**
You are clueless. Go to class.

You are arguing that the shooting was justified because he was "a criminal evading arrest in a stolen vehicle after taking the police on a chase."
You said, "What do you expect them to do, shoot water guns?". I expect peace officers to keep the peace, and any time an incident involves the shooting of an unarmed individual, they have failed at their job. 
The penalty for stealing a vehicle is not death by firing squad. The penalty for running from the police on foot is not death by firing squad. The penalty for grabbing into a bag is not death by firing squad.
You are a sanctimonious taint who has absolutely no clue what you're talking about. You sound like a rube and don't know it. I hope, for your sake, that you're under 25 years old and your brain is not fully developed so that there is at least a small chance that you do not parade through the rest of your life this cocksure of yourself despite being a blithering idiot. 
And nobody gives a fuck who you think is or isn't a scumbag, and the penalty for that, also, is not death by firing squad. But maybe being a bloviating piece of shit on Reddit for yucks should carry that penalty. I will fucking co-sign.
