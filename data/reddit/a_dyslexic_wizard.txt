Funny enough they had no red/blue joycons and personality I don’t like them. 
And I’ve been surprised how great this console is!

I’m still so confused on why this is happening.. although I have read that BTC normally performs bad in the second half of January.. so with this added too the recent Korean exchange, market cap event.. I’m guessing it all makes sense.. right? Next month we should be right back to a Alt season for another 2 months before we head Back to btc season

I’ve always been told to hold.. and looking back at a year of learning from my mistakes.. I wish I did hodl more.. if I did I would still have my NEO which recently hit an ATH and ETH.
I’ve learnt my lesson, invest in solid coins/tokens and hold.. They will always recover and explode in value.

Nothing crazy and wasn’t too expensive as too take too much from my profit.

Alt coins are just here so newbies like myself can make enough money to invest in Bitcoin. 
There are no alternative to Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is the one and only king. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:23:27
That’s actually a great way too put it.. into the future owning a single bitcoin might be quite unrealistic, all you would need is a fraction of a full bitcoin to make good money 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:54:02
Join Twitter, follow people like  and 
They will warn you when Alt season is approaching or if it’s time to jump onto bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:45:10
No but if I buy $1000 of let’s say CVC and CVC reaches $1 then I can buy a lot more BTC than if I was to originally just brought BTC.
In Fact the first 3 months I was in Crypto I made so much in Alts before Bitcoin exploded 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:31:41
I also feel like the price isn’t justified, $10,000 should of been its ATM and BTC should of correction itself around $8000. 
This explosion of value seems unjustified, I absolutely believe now is the time to diversify, alt season is WAY over due. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:41:25
CoinJar 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:16:55
I turn $500 into $6000.. the key is too hold.. if you buy a coin and it dips, hold, never try and cut your loses, 
The second most important thing to learn is when is Alt season and when is bitcoin season, join Twitter and follow crypto account, they will let you know when Alts begin to weaken or strengthen and it’s time to jump ship for the other side.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:43:34
Only $100 worth of bitcoin is more than safe on the exchange, personally anymore than 3 bitcoin and then you must start storing it.
Until your first whole bitcoin, you will be more than okay keeping it on the exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:11:45
You can invest in BTC (bitcoin) or you can invest in Alts (alternative coins).
I don’t have enough of an money to buy bitcoin so I’m investing in Alts to make enough to then invest in Bitcoin. 
You can use Coinbase to buy BTC or use an exchange like Bittrex to buy Alts and sell them when you made a profit for BTC
Also join twitter and follow cryptocurrency accounts, (just look up $btc for example and you will find them). They will help you in deciding what to invest and on rare occasion when to buy and sell for max profit.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:25:08
I hope it does.. but I have a feeling we might see a second ATH because of Futures 
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:06:16
Im new too, start off by investing in Alt Coins (now is the perfect time to do so). 
Once you made enough, sell out and buy into bitcoin, 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:27:34
SO NOW EVERY NOOB IS DUMPING THIER ALTS TO BUY BTC AT ITS ATH
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:07:57
You sell while it’s climbing.. not while it’s falling. In this example, you hold till it bottoms out then buy this beautiful dip.
Get out of here you crypto-sceptic noob.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:21:20
Great! So will I have time to build my Alts up to get some BTC or will BTC go lower than $10,000? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:40:54
Personally no, at the moment Bitcoin (BTC) has constantly hitting All Time Highs (ATH). 
And at the rate BTC is way over due for a correction, and the longer it waits and the higher it goes the bigger the correction it will be.
If I was you, join Bittrex and get into Alts, and once Bitcoin has its correction, then move into bitcoin. 
Look into POWR, LSK, ARK, LTC, UBQ, NEO etc 
Join Twitter and look up and follow people like CarpeNoctom and WolfOfPoloniex‬, they will let you know about coins you should invest or keep an eye on.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:45:22
Buy Alts then sell them at a profit then get into BTC
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:28:13
Yesterday was mental with all the media coverage, so I checked my brothers and girlfriend phones and no mention anywhere, while I think there has been an increase in media coverage that those who are already in the crypto game would notice the increase the majorly of people still wouldn’t of seen or heard anything. 
The media is obviously starting to take an interest but as of yet, still haven’t spread the news to the average person.
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:08:12
I’ve heard bitcoin before but never took it seriously because every-time I heard it there was never enough Information for i to take it seriously or understand what it was. 
But when my brother brought some ETH so decided to do some research and did the same, my plan was to deal with alts then buy into bitcoin which would of worked if I didn’t miss all the signals to sell alts and get into bitcoin around August.
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:25:29
I never used twitter myself, the only reason why I signed up was for those guys, they often say crypto moves too quickly for Facebook, Twitter is the perfect social media for crypto. 
You really only option is twitter unfortunately 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:42:19
I like Kraken but my main exchange is Bittrex 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:43:12
I’ve been using Bittrex since I got into Crypto because almost everyone I tried to join I had issues verifying my identity, Bittrex has been great. 
So it worries me that people are having problem with them. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:21:57
CoinJar is Australian own so start their if you want to get into Alts go to Bittrex 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:21:59

@_date: 2018-04-06 12:54:26
My point was that his entry point must of been pretty low for it too make sense selling BTC at $6000.
And it honestly doesn’t matter if the current resistance levels don’t hold up.. the chance to sell BTC has gone.. for you to sell BTC you needed a low entry point otherwise you might as well hold. 
If you wanted to Cut your losses, the last chance most people got was at $10K.. any further down as it just doesn’t make long term sense, since most people brought in above 10K
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:43:13
Securing Profits? At $6000? When did he buy? At $500?
BTC has gone from $20,000 to $6000, I’m pretty sure you missed that sweet ‘profit taking’ position, and with BTC at $6000, it won’t effect you that much by holding down to $1000 and slowly watch it rise up again. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 11:29:08
Weak hands.. why would you sell? At $6000 you might as well hodl
