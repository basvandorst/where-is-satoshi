Thanks guys, I can confirm that scanning the private key shows the missing amount, and 3 public keys that are associated with it. One of them is the 3Kr2... address to which it was sent. phew!
Thank you for your comprehensive explanation, thanks u/castorfromtheva for finding and thanks for your explanation also. You guys rock!
And to all that offered help: thanks for the effort, you guys make this community a better place!

Yes, I read about change addresses.
I am guessing that Mycelium created this change address, but it does not show up in my wallet and I don't have the private key. I don't know where it came from so I'm guessing that Mycelium must have created it. So I am also guessing that I should be able to access it. It would be a bit strange if they just generated it and throw away the key.
So my wallet only shows the other address, with the 0.1 BTC on it.
When I choose "show unspent outputs" it only shows the 0.1 BTC.
Anyone know how Mycelium handles this change address?

Well, maybe you could add a help item or faq entry like "where's my change?" and explain, or add "how can i use this?" to the change address in the transaction details.
It was not clear to me as a noob that there was a link between the original address and the segwit address.
Explaining it might remove the scary part and allows you to decide later if it's a bug or a feature :)
