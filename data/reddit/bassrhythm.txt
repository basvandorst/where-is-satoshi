No confirmations in an hour for me (Ajax refresh started kicking back visible markup too). Currently the homepage gives me a 522 error (timeout between CloudFlare and the origin server).

Taxes are due in the U.S. in 5 days and some BTC owners owe $. That's at least part of it.

Seriously - stop with the short-term-focused news on China. I've seen this over and over again, and stop pretending this means anything long-term. At a minimum, Bitcoin is a revolutionary method of GLOBAL payment transmittance which is slightly dependent but not nearly exclusive to China. Beyond that, whether it is relegated to commodity status or whether it becomes more internationally recognized as currency, that is for time to tell. These short-term scares mean little, and for god's sake, stop being so short-sighted.

Dogecoin and other memecoins are doing a massive disservice to the Bitcoin community and should be shunned by anyone who cares at all about the future of money on this planet. They offer nothing new (other than pure mockery), demonstrating to those still learning about Bitcoin that it itself is nothing more than a joke, because, after all, it isn't even taken seriously in its own crypto-currency community. The creators may as well have created a FuckBitcoin coin. How is this not obvious?

No libertarian is against laws protecting a person or their property from harm, theft, etc. On the contrary, those are the types of laws that they support.

I actually just bought the Civ V Humble Bundle earlier this week using BTC and have purchased haircuts with it as well.

All good now it appears - site is back and confirmation count is updated for me.

It baffles me that an economy based on maximal spending and consumption is in any way considered healthy. Planned obsolescence, disposable everything, massive amounts of environmental waste, perpetual debt, etc., are all very short-sighted. Compare that to an economy that "economizes", where the goal is (in part) to continuously increase durability, reduce cost, and minimize the production of "useless junk", while at the same time promoting both saving, investing, and creating the highest quality goods possible.  
The whole concept of "deflation bad" is only contextually true - true if you base your economy on the rate at which currency changes hands instead of upon the long-term value it creates. Unfortunately, in our current paradigm, deflation hurts those with the greatest debt, so any sort of paradigm shift would absolutely need to require widespread (one-time) debt-forgiveness to be able to take root.

CampBX deserves very little respect - their actions range from incompetent to fraudulent, "losing" customers' deposits on a regular basis (only to "find" them months later) and flat-out lying about attempting to do ACH withdrawals to customer accounts (which they claim fail but never actually do). Just take a look at their Facebook reviews and their [BBB rating]( (an F).
Also, they are located in Georgia but their servers are in the Netherlands - they are NOT completely U.S.-based.

Agreed - and indeed it does

Using client deposits alone to provide credit/loans is *not* fractional reserve lending - that's just regular lending. On the other hand, using those deposits as the foundation to determine how much you can loan (e.g., loaning out 9x what is on deposit and essentially creating new currency in the process) *is* fractional reserve lending** - something that cannot be done with BTC alone.


Credit, in this case, would be extended using regular lending as reference above (since you can't just create currency if someone doesn't pay you back) - the higher the risk, the higher the interest charged, as has been done for generations.
** That's why they call it "fractional reserve" lending - you only need a fraction on-hand of what you are "lending".

Don't worry, you just need to hodl until we have at least 10 different claims to the "real" bitcoin:
* Bitcoin Cash
* Bitcoin 2X
* Bitcoin Gold
* Bitcoin Platinum
* Bitcoin Diamond
* Bitcoin Moon
* Bitcoin Stars
* Bitcoin Universe
* Bitcoin Infinity
* Bitcoin And Beyond
Surely this won't be a giant black eye to the bitcoin community - surely....and I'm saying this as someone who started purchasing in early 2013 and still have a good amount - this is getting ridiculous(!). The ONLY reason I still have bitcoin is its *predictable deflationary* gold-like aspects (superior to the and/or alternatives, esp. debt-based). Bitcoin community, keep tearing yourselves apart while a close market-cap competitor like ETH adapts something like that into their block generation algorithm and you won't have much left going for you. Just saying, and I know I'm not the only one /smh

You heard it here first, haha (sort of)!

If someone hands you money, whether by creating it from nothing or taking from someone else, that is free money (for you)
If someone believes in and voluntarily chooses to invest in the same asset as you and the value goes up, that is not "free money" - that is the free market at work

Not ultra old school here, but old school enough to remember walking into BofA to deposit into my Bitfloor account. Thanks, Coinbase, for making my purchases a hell of a lot easier.

The site OP mentioned requires no sign-up - when you first load the page, it automatically creates an account for you (accessible directly via the URL listed under My Account).

Thank you (even though I missed it up until now &gt;&lt;).

Not sure if I'd call Bitcoin "private money" - it's definitely more public (open-source, open-ledger) than than any state version. Good news, nonetheless.
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:49:16
I don't think buying it all is a realistic scenario, but if someone (a government, for example) offered a high enough price per bitcoin that practically everyone decided to sell, you would wind up with (1) some very rich sellers, and likely, (2) a new cryptocurrency that would take its place and become more popular than the formerly displaced one.

Mainly bitcoin first, then use some of that for land/housing/PMs IMO. Having enough food on-hand to last awhile should be priority  (you can't eat bitcoin - yet).

Bitstamp went to $382 for a brief moment this last hour, but it's back over $500 now. That said, you're probably right going forward.

To catch on with the general public, though, a shorter word may be needed.

Taken from one of those bitcointalk.org links mentioned above:






Telling a customer that their ACH withdrawal failed when in reality it was never even attempted in the first place has nothing to do with being overworked. It's deception, plain and simple.
Coinbase, on the other hand IMO, is a much better example of a team that is overworked and needs more staff. They are admittedly slow in replying to responses, but I've never had a problem there.
Regarding your post:


Absolutely true. I've been meaning to try out BTC-E for some time now too, so thanks for the tip there.

It's still inflation when prices are the same for products that are shrinking.

ACH takes around ~2-3 days, just like anywhere else. The bank transfer is in effect as soon as the button/link to cancel the purchase disappears.
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:21:15
That link I posted has 15+ per page, and there are pages and pages. And if you haven't noticed that that many products have been getting smaller these last few years (maybe longer) with no price reduction, you must be blind - I see it constantly when I go shopping. 
Re: CPI, bbbbbubble is correct in that it is not a static formula, but rather one that is manipulated to maintain the illusion of low inflation. Google "cpi manipulation" and learn.

There is an extra point that I didn't raise, though - injecting that much extra money in the banking books puts us one step closer to actual (and potentially massive) price inflation, since it gives the banks a much greater potential to inflate the money supply via loans. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:48:36
Definitely rolls off the tongue nicely. As does "mu-bit" for μBTC, I think.
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:33:16
Looks like "MilliBit" is the front-runner short word, at least according to [this]( "Millie" and "Mikey" are referenced there as well as potential phrasings for mBTC and μBTC (similar to how quid is slang for a pound).
@_date: 2013-12-20 01:12:02
An increase in the money supply combined with an increase in the velocity of that money causes price inflation - it is not caused by inflation in the money supply alone. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:40:53
Is this in any way related to the myriad of complaints I see on their Facebook page - cashed/uncredited deposits, missing bitcoin, 30+ day wait time for ticket responses, etc.? Seems like a separate issue, which is even more unsettling.
@_date: 2013-12-19 21:17:19
Really? Dishonesty seems to be their MO, at least according to references I've seen on their Facebook page reviews/posts and on bitcointalk.org. For an example of the latter, see [here]( and [here]( (both taken from posts on their FB page). It looks like there are a lot more like this on bitcointalk.org as well.
