I bought a couple bitcoin a while ago, forgot about it, and am currently scrambling to find the account information and which site I used.

The whole economy relies on the dollar currently does that mean bitcoin doesn’t exist?

Why don’t you think gold is used then? Gold is too volatile to use as common currency too. from early 2000s to 2011 the price of gold quadrupled our economy would be full of trillionaires and poor people if we didn’t have paper money.  Then from 2011 to now it almost has halved. Meaning any savings people had in 2011 would have now been cut in half.

Gold is pretty old, still volatile.

Do you not understand how detrimental to any kind of economy the random extreme fluctuation of the value of their currency will be?
Bitcoin was worth $20,000 a year ago, now it’s worth less than $5000. Anyone who would have gotten paid a $40,000 value salary that year would have gotten 2 bitcoin, which if not spent immediately would now be worth less than $10,000. That would mean anyone who got paid above the poverty level will now be in the lowest levels of poverty the brackets. With a whole economy relying on a crypto currency, the value would fall far more than it would ever increase. 
The good thing about government money, is if your government is going to crap then you can always reinvest in another country’s currency. Yes it’s a downside to it, see Venezuela, but it didn’t happen overnight and while people got screwed they’re just using different currencies now. The real answer is to have gold-backed currency, but that is no longer possible with such a large economy. The current answer is to not hold on to large sums of cash. You do this by investing in the stock market as a more risky but easier way, or by buying businesses, houses, and similar that don’t go down in value with the currency. But little fluctuations like inflation is what keeps the incredibly wealthy from hoarding their money. Also in a democracy you get a little say in how your currency is handled.

If it’s more widely adapted. Bitcoin for example takes forever to transfer. Other currencies have their own issues. 
US dollar hyper inflation wont “just happen”. It would have to be purposefully done. 
Also bitcoin is decided by the people who buy it for how much it’s worth, which will by definition always be volatile and therefore unusable as a common currency.

Government money doesn't halve in value randomly

There’s not much to elaborate about, it’s just such a stupid remark. 
When the dollar loses value to inflation, it doesn’t go to anyone. It just loses value for everyone. If there was no inflation, or deflation, there is no reason for rich people to put their money somewhere that doesn’t depreciate. But if there’s inflation, they have to put it somewhere. Which is great because there are a whole lot of businesses that can use such investment and it helps the economy.

Everything you said in this comment is as baseless as a fortune cookie. 
@_date: 2019-01-20 13:36:52
Geez, it takes a lot of ignorance to think inflation is a bad thing. 
@_date: 2019-01-20 14:25:58
I misread your comment initially.

“a centralized authority literally stealing 2%”
So you don’t understand how inflation works?
@_date: 2019-01-20 03:08:57
A central bank is necessary to protect consumers, facilitate trade, keep prices stable and to keep people employed. 
If serves he interests of the public.

Which is a good thing. If there wasn’t inflation, billionaires and rich people can’t just store their money away, they have to put it in somewhere that the value doesn’t change/increases. 
Only so much bitcoin can be circulated. It would eventually accumulate at the top 1% and leave almost none for everyone else. 
Inflation hurts the multi-millionaires and billionaires, 2% of 1 billion dollars is a lot more than 2% of most people’s $2000 in savings. Therefor it helps people like us (and 90% of this subreddit) and gets money flowing back down the bottom. That’s great because there are a bunch of small and large businesses out there that need a little bit of investment to take off. 
Also you’re simply wrong to say “Government money is printable”. Money is not printed, currency is. Money is created say when a bank gives a loan that is backed by a worker’s labor/skills and is then fed back into the bank. Creating money isn’t an intentional thing the government does.
