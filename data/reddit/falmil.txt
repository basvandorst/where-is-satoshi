How is it other people's money?

Not sure what the big deal is. They reviewed a device that basically prints money in exchange for electricity and gave the money a fitting crypto end by locking it away forever.
Anyone reading it would still be excited at the prospect of buying an asic device for mining when they could make that profit.
Who cares if they get some ad revenue.

I think what he was trying to get at was the ability to generate money with a device with nothing but the cost of electricity.

Why would he feel like an idiot for that? People burn ~$200 on stupid shit all the time.

Kinda in BFL's interest to get their device advertised.

And OP isn't for leaving $1200 worth of bitcoin in a car

I don't understand this. MOST of the world is already quasi-unregulated. People in power and with enough money make the rules and benefit the most from them. If anything, we need a place where money and power have no effect, with regulation to keep it that way.

The bitcoins may have a fixed amount, but their value is free to fluctuation in response to bitcoins exiting the economy. The remaining bitcoins are just worth more now. Considering how far you can break them down, their value is replaceable.
Not to mention, this would have the same effect as simply saving them and not spending them.

People who have ordered aren't going to back out now, and now they've generated demand from people not familiar with their company or bitcoin. Its a no-brainier.
Depending on how they manufacture these things, they would probably want to figure out the number of units they need up front anyway. Which means they need to get the most demand now.

I am not sure what you are trying to say here. It only took 2 weeks to generate that money, so it could be replaced in 2 weeks at no cost other than electricity. The bitcoins are replaceable in terms of their value.

So...they are NOT burning (defined as destroying) other people's money. They are just helping to increase the difficulty, reducing returns in the future. Their one little box is doing basically nothing compared to what will happen when all those ASICs everyone ordered start coming online.
Not to mention that if the coins are harder to get, their value will actually go up.
