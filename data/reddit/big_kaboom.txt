More like some people did a hostile takeover of Coke and started putting arsenic in it, and then some rogue employees took the original formula and started selling it as Coke Classic.

Bitcoin can't be used as a currency right now.  I would recommend getting set up with Bitcoin Cash, which works just fine.

The market plays by the rules built into the code.  The code is broken and thus, so is the market.

I don't understand how LN is able to be so fast, scalable, secure, and decentralized in a way that Bitcoin isn't.  Why have Bitcoin at all?  Why not just use Lightning or Lightning coin?

Why are you so emotional?
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:28:17
Who keeps track of all of this "passing along" of bitcoins.  If Bitcoin uses the blockchain, then what does LN use?
I'm having a really hard time grappling with the details.

I can't tell if you are stupid on purpose or on accident.  Either way, the end result is the same.

Wow, you don't sound like a shill at all!
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:48:09
oooh, good one.

They guy clearly said "assets", which is plural.  Bitcoin Cash is the number 3 coin on coinmarketcap in terms of market cap, number two in terms of transaction volume.
Clearly it is a top asset in the crypto space.
You are also clearly intentionally losing your mind and letting your emotions run roughshod all over your critical thinking skills.
You missed (intentionally) the fact that he was using asset in the plural and not saying that Bitcoin Cash is *the* top asset, but rather *a* top asset.
How can anyone take you seriously when you behave like that?  Get ahold of yourself.

I have also been in bitcoin since 2013.  r/bitcoin used to be fun and informative.  There was also a lot of discussion about promising altcoins like Eth. it was when Gavin started seriously talking about needing to raise the *you know what* that people like this started coming out of nowhere.
I will also point out the Blockstream received over $70m in funding about that time and have produced basically nothing since then.  I can imagine a lot of that $70m has been spent attempting to stop dissent using cancerous trolls like this.

You're lying.

Oh yeah, totally.

We tried to compromise with XT and then with Classic.  Core has decided that there is no compromise.  They don't get to (and wont) come crawling on their hands and knees now that they are losing.

What about people who understand it but don't wanna pay $10 for a transaction fee?
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:38:43
Latest average fee is ~$3 but that's only because transaction volume is at a two year low.  If interest gets renewed again then prepare to see $30 fees again.  Whether the fee is $30 or $3 it is still too much to be used in transactions and too unpredictable as well.

Does everyone you don't like use paid shills all the time?

I don't take 8 day old accounts seriously.  Especially on this sub.

Redditor for 7 days praises Core.  I'm truly shocked.
