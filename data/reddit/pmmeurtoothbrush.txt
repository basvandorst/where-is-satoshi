He’s saying he wants to see people using it instead of holding it.
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:56:47
You guys trust Katy Perry?
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:45:30
Listen to him talk to retards at occupy Wall Street. It’s like a guy with a PhD talking to a bunch of toddlers. He’s not that bad and we don’t know the future of bitcoin. It’s okay to be skeptical of new things.

Somethings gotta drive the price up 
@_date: 2018-01-12 06:04:43
I just realized how shot his place is.
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:25:56
Should have pulled out and reinvested. But hindsight is 2020
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:37:13
That’s why it’s a good idea to keep a diverse wallet.

Get access to a scanner and scan your ID my dude.

21,362 by the end of the day!
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:49:59
People contemplating buying are “you people.”
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:59:50
I was trying to tell my coworkers this. Just drop 100 bucks in and watch it turn into 150...
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:14:58
Very cool stuff, that’s for the gift of knowledge today!
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:10:16
You don’t need to sell all of it. You can start to sell your initial investment over time if you’ve got enough to keep riding.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:47:55
Dip before another ATH. Read the charts my dude.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:22:07
I wish I had more to spend...

LEAGALIZE LSD

@_date: 2017-12-18 17:27:52
Because they have money?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:33:02
Either way I’m gonna eat a burger..
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:30:57
This is a dank fucking copypasta.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:56:56
What makes you say such
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:54:59
Naw I just made that number up. Had no idea it was part of the sequence.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:20:39
This one time I was tripping and I had gone to the bank with a friend for him to take out some cash and when I looked at the money I just got so angry because the money itself doesn’t carry any value. Our money only has value right now but who knows what the future holds.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:34:15
I had to use my scanner to scan my drivers license, my phone camera just wasn’t doing it.
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:51:01
But they can incentivize people to adopt their new coin.
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:15:27
If it crashes buy more.
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:13:39
If banks can make money with my money then I want an actual portion of the profit. This is the real reason I left my savings account behind.
@_date: 2019-06-21 15:45:45
12k EOD today
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:10:38
The whole point of removing net neutrality is to increase competition. Somehow you just argued for it in your comment. Congrats.
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:08:24
Did you decide?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:10:31
You aren’t a shill you’re just intrigued by the possibilities of the coin. I don’t think anyone really knows what’s going to happen.
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:53:56
Don’t wait for a dip.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:27:03
Congrats on me for taking so long to transfer the funds to buy and missing out on 3k profits.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:02:31
My parents are super skeptical of btc lmao I woke up this morning to 11k and before I could even say it to them they said it to me. I think they’re starting to like it.
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:50:43
Using Gdax? How would I do such?
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:19:54
Sure. Gimme a couple hours tho
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:32:06
WE DID IT
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:44:05
Shitty interest rate? You mean no interest rate? For fucks sake. This is what drove me to store my money into bitcoin instead of my savings account.
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:12:21
Love you too.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:13:45
Never too late sir.
@_date: 2018-02-16 16:51:19
This better be ironic
@_date: 2018-02-23 16:14:13
Be careful of pump and dump. If it’s already high it might be getting dumped soon.
@_date: 2018-02-17 16:52:39
Looks like that green is their signature color
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:03:33
Thanks. I should have pulled out when it was still 15k
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:15:41

Just buy it wtf. It's just going to keep going up.
@_date: 2018-02-23 21:37:18
venezuela is shot and Poland is smart to not trust their bs currency.
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:20:55
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:51:03
It's almost as if it's a currency...
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:51:11
There's no point in checking the prices right now. Why not just sleep on it and let it do its thing?
@_date: 2017-10-19 02:18:00
its a currency get over it
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:34:52
Fuck the Uniparty...
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:47:27
I just don't understand why he feels the need to tell other people what to do with themselves.
@_date: 2018-04-07 23:33:17
These numbers don’t mean shit. Having Pokémon go in there is beyond retarded.
@_date: 2019-05-07 20:32:26
Government bailing out big banks is the real disaster.
