It's a bit easier to hide Bitcoin than gold or cash though isn't it...
More importantly than the fact people can hide from taxation is the fact that **taxation must replace inflation/money printing when the government wants to spend.**
That is the primary way our savings are confiscated.
Imagine if George Bush had had to say "We want to go into Iraq... but in order to pay for it you all have to pay $1000 more tax a year." He wouldn't get very far now would he.

You can't program the database to be able to tell if a given string is a valid name or not. That shouldn't be too hard to understand.
Bitcoin uses digital signatures to prove that a transaction is technically valid. But what happens if two different nodes receive two technically valid transactions which actually spend the same coins from the same addresses? That's where the blockchain comes in. A miner will only be able to include one of those transactions into a valid block, since they both spend from the same address. Once the miner finds a valid block, he broadcasts it to all the nodes. The node which got the incorrect transaction will look at the block and conclude that the transaction they received was false/fraudulent, and discard it. Otherwise it will fall out of sync with the chain.
The bitcoin blockchain is the first database invented where we are 100% guaranteed that all data going back a reasonable amount of time (one hour say) is immutable and valid. It corresponds to the facts on the ground (money being transferred), which is completely unlike traditional DBs.

Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe this is because LND used to require bitcoind to have txindex=1. That is no longer the case in the latest release, which can run on a pruned, non-txindex bitcoind backend.
LND will however function faster/better with a fully indexed node, as it can look up transactions more quickly.

That just means you don't have Uncomplicated Firewall running, so it's not that UFW is blocking incoming connections. Basically there are two issues you could be having: 1) your router isn't forwarding traffic to your node 2) your node's firewall is blocking traffic.
The first is fixed in your router's settings, and by ensuring your node has a static IP on the local network (don't use DHCP to assign the IP). The second is fixed on your node's host system itself. Good luck!

They didn't fail because they were made illegal. They failed because they **could** be made illegal. Satoshi's emphasis in the abstract of his paper is perfect. He solved the double spend problem, which was the last piece in the puzzle that neither Wei Dai nor Nick Szabo nor a teenage Peter Todd could figure out. Solving it removed the need to trust a centralised third party.
Listen to Peter Todd's interview with Peter McCormack on What Bitcoin Did.
In it, he describes how he thought the fundamental problem was limiting the issuance of new currency. But Satoshi realised the real problem was more broad - how do we make it expensive to update the ledger (which includes but is not limited to issuing new currency). He did this using proof of work as a mechanism to update the blockchain.
To answer your questions - they aren't doing anything about it **a)** because they really can't and **b)** because doing something about it would require showing up at people's houses with guns and arresting them for running software. As much as the state is all-powerful, that's not something they would get away with in many western countries at least. Nor would it be practically possible, because there are tens of thousands of nodes running behind Tor hidden services.

It needs to be said: we will only see meaningful action on preserving block space when not doing so hits these companies in the pocket. That means we need real fees.
Despite a huge growth in transaction volume during this bear market, fees have continually fallen to being almost negligible today. $2,000,000,000 USD transacted, $65,000 dollars in fees in the last 24 hours = 0.003%.

Hi Theymos, I didn't see this reply the first time around.


The main thrust of this post can be summed up in two points: 
* Bitcoin will have high fees. No matter what block size we choose as the maximum safe size, we will have high fees.
* Non-technical users/investors should show some humility in the face of a difficult technical and social problem.
The reason I posted this was as a reaction to the cries of "raise the block size" to the mempool being full for a few weeks.

Nope, you're wrong.
The tiny amount that is kept reserved for closing the channel is trivial.
The channel in this example has a capacity of $12 USD. That value is far too low compared to what channel sizes will be once the software is actually complete.
All the commit fee is saying, is that you can't spend 100% of your money just in case something goes wrong, rather 99% of it.
Again, this is going to be abstracted away and no one will notice it in practice.
Stop wasting everyone's time with your lame assertions with no argument or evidence.

There are so many bcash trolls in here at the moment downvoting the truth.
You're right; bitcoin fees must be high. The level of security that an on-chain bitcoin transaction provides is far too high for small transactions.
Bitcoin isn't Visa or Paypal. It's the Fed. Other solutions, either trustless like LN, or trusted like Paypal for bitcoin, are what allows volume.

Raise the block size and fees will still be high. It's pretty simple. You can create a false solution which solves nothing or you can acknowledge the plain truth which is blockchain transactions can never be cheap, due to the inherent inefficiency of the system.

A pi can definitely handle bitcoin core + lightning, assuming you mean LND but the other implementations probably use even less RAM.
Not sure about Monero.


There is definitely a better alternative. The attractive thing about a Pi is the general purpose IO ports, used for funky science projects. You'll likely never use these, so it's better to get an Odroid for example from hardkernel. Has double the RAM so will definitely be able to handle Monero on top. And it costs about the same.

You're not the arbiter of what the community is or isn't. You're objectively wrong about that, since we have been having this exact debate for years now. It's settled. Bcash exists. Here's the subreddit: We're not having this conversation again, it's over. Go away.
@_date: 2019-04-01 08:35:32
Other 1 sat transactions are no more or less legitimate than the "spam". Think of it this way: the "spammer" gets value out of spamming, otherwise they wouldn't pay to do it. The person buying a coffee for a 1 sat fee also gets value.
In this scenario, miners would take every transaction with a fee of 2 sats/byte or greater, and if they had any block space left, they'd fill it with 1 sat transactions. Sometimes those will be "spam", sometimes they'll be coffee purchases. No one can know.
So: if you know the mempool is full, potentially because some guy is spamming 1 sat/byte transactions, you need to bid at least 2 sats. Not hard, eh?
@_date: 2019-04-08 10:30:48
Yes absolutely. Fees need to rise to the point where Coinbase and Veriblock start losing money and are forced to optimise. Fees need to rise to the point where people are actually forced to use LN or trusted services, instead of using the most ridiculously secure and over the top network to send $50.
On-chain Bitcoin transactions should be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars worth each, if not more, in the near future.

Storage was never the issue. We've been over this a million times in the last four years.
What's important is bandwidth + IBD.

Nice way to start us off by insulting the most experienced core dev who has made untold contributions to bitcoin, including figuring out how to do segwit with a soft fork after years of thinking it could only be done by hard fork.
So you think you're more technically knowledgeable than Luke? By the way, many of the core devs agree with his technical argument, they just don't think it would fly socially, and I agree with them.
Bitcoin must have high fees, and it will have high fees. Here's why.
Currently VeriBlock makes up &gt;20% of bitcoin transactions. Since fees are so low, they can happily and inefficiently spam the blockchain and fill up blocks. If we increase the block size to 2 MB, they will just spam more and fill it up again. Keep going till you get to the 32 MB of bcash. Now you have full 32 MB blocks, the same fees as we have now, but I and countless others are forced to turn off our nodes because we can't deal with the bandwidth.
So you've achieved nothing for LN, nothing for Bitcoin but you've centralised the network.
The level of security on Bitcoin's blockchain is so far beyond what is necessary for 99% of transactions. Those transactions must occur off chain. Either on trustless second layers like LN, or on custodial, trusted SQL databases like Coinbase or Paypal.
The world we live in where people are still using on-chain addresses and sending small transactions on them is a temporary state. It cannot and will not last for much longer. High fees are an inevitability.
If you don't like that, or think I'm wrong, we've already had this debate, for years. It's not going to happen again. Here is where to go: &amp;
@_date: 2019-04-08 19:16:56

Mined coins are valued more highly by some people than bought coins because, apart from meeting up in the street, you can't really obtain bitcoin without some other party knowing.

I would describe myself as anti-intellectual to an extent, despite having a tertiary qualification in Engineering.
The reason is that today's rampant social engineering comes straight out of the universities. But this isn't a new thing. Intellectuals were apologising for the Soviet Union for decades while they murdered their population by the millions, simply because communism fit their intellectual theories on how the world should work.
I want wise intellectuals, not just intellectuals.

This is a dumb argument, bcash troll.
The funds are only lost in the case you actually need to force/cooperatively close the channel, which will be very rare indeed.
In times when there are high fees, more capacity needs to be kept back. This amount will be so small that the user won't notice it.

Yes, we can. Not only can we afford it, but it is literally inevitable and is part of the design. I suggest you go and read the whitepaper.
When the mining reward dries up, which is fast approaching, fees will need to be several orders of magnitude higher. Eventually, individuals will not use the base layer at all - it will purely be for settlement, a la the Federal Reserve system.

The next major release is 0.18.0 and is scheduled for February 2019.
A minor release 0.17.1 will be release in the meantime.
As for the content of the release, there are a few themes which I can identify, but I'm no expert:
* Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions
* Further work on separating the wallet from the daemon
* Further work on the creation of a "libconsensus", which would allow for developers to more easily create their own node software without worrying about consensus bugs.
* Optimisations and bug fixes
The "inflation bug" has slowed down development. Don't expect Schnorr until mid 2019 at the earliest.

Sorry my dude, but you've got this completely wrong.


45% adoption just over a year on is phenomenal. Remember that this is a global monetary system. Change cannot happen quickly; there are literally billions of dollars at stake. If you have $100 in Bitcoin, sure you move over to a segwit address. If you have $10 million, then you are naturally extremely cautious about it. The same goes for exchanges, who make the vast majority of transactions - they have built a secure platform based on one address format. Asking them to change represents a significant engineering investment. At the moment there are very few incentives to move to segwit, while fees are low. Again, 45% is amazing and well ahead of expectations.


Every second spent screaming on social media is a second not testing or writing code. These guys aren't marketers, there is an opportunity cost for one's time. I'd hazard a guess that you're a student with that attitude.

Your assumption is that the attackers would understand timelocked contracts. Instead, they're more likely to think you're lying and beat you to a pulp.
The age of getting away with being careless with your privacy on BTC is over. Use Lightning Network wherever possible to transact, never reuse addresses, and think about your UTXO set and how you are relating coins to each other when you spend them.
