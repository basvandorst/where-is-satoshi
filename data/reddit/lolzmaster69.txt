Sure it is.
But do you seriously think they shouldn’t have done it?
Is slightly raising inflation back to a healthy level of 2% really so bad that it isn’t worth saving the economy?

Yeah but the only actually useful aspect of bitcoin, blockchain technology, will be used by banks and bitcoin itself will be not be given a real chance to succeed
@_date: 2019-03-17 14:08:55
Nope that’s not true.

You’re fooling yourself if you don’t think the banks don’t have the power to stop bitcoin from being an actual player in payments. With how much AML nonsense the banks have to deal with, they will lobby the shit out of making the AML process be just as strict when it comes to exchanges.
The government doesn’t want anonymous payments to be happening on a wider scale as well. 
It’s not happening. The technology will be used but bitcoin itself will not be given a real chance.

Ever heard of standard deviation or this thing called risk?
@_date: 2019-03-17 12:37:00
It is a currency. Currencies aren’t useful if their values are volatile. You just proved the point

“Sad attempt to stay relevant”
Pot meet kettle.
That’s bitcoin, not JPMC
@_date: 2019-01-23 15:32:40
Even if that was true, they have the power and it’s not changing anytime soon
@_date: 2019-01-20 06:49:02
It’s ironic that this makes it less valuable. Regulators aren’t cool with the AML risks of an anonymous transaction 
@_date: 2019-01-23 15:17:03
Yup. Add in the fact that regulators aren’t cool with anonymous transfers of currency and there are rigorous AML requirements that are over 80 pages long in most countries that banks have to follow. Regulators will eventually shift these requirements to any institution that deals with bitcoin.
Banks and the government will not let Bitcoin prosper. Not that I don’t think bitcoin is a great idea in theory, but I’m sorry, it isn’t going to happen.
