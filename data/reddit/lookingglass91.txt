What is this?
@_date: 2019-07-08 12:11:28
Should have set them up with a lightning wallet mate
@_date: 2019-07-25 13:52:37
@_date: 2019-07-12 19:51:01
Yea it just doesn’t load for me
@_date: 2019-07-08 14:16:45
lol, just cause you helped them set it up, doesnt mean they need to use it, it's up to them after they do their own research if they would want to continue using it :)
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:11:58
Btc isn’t about that, you don’t need to boycott the dollar, people will do that on their own when they realize how much value the dollar is actually worth (not looking good). Bitcoin is about achieving financial sovereignty for yourself and getting away from a central authority.
@_date: 2019-07-12 19:56:35
How are you viewing? It says page not found for me
@_date: 2019-07-08 14:02:28
Whats the name of the website, Ill look more into it
@_date: 2019-03-15 19:10:43
Yea, forget about how its able to move value seamlessly, world wide, without being censored or stopped by a government or corporation. 
@_date: 2019-03-22 17:42:08
I have one, 
how about you animate something along the lines of the current turmoil in politics. it doesn't matter which side you're on, left, right, middle.. we "elect people" that are supposed to have the peoples interest in mind, but they don't pass bills that are for the people, instead, they line their pockets with money from big corporations that lobby (bribe) them to pass or not pass a bill. 
you could use big corporations such as comcast or at&amp;t that lobby against freedom of an open Internet for everyone.. such as certain ISP's close down websites that they do not agree with or throttling certain websites making them slow because they do not own the website.  (or maybe a censored google for china)
we the people are tired of the authoritarian government breathing down our necks creating laws that do not help average citizens and that does not serve us and goes against the freedoms we enjoy like free speech (twitter bans / facebook bans based on what people post or say or even in worse cases, people having their bank account and funds frozen because of what they posted online) 
this leads us to a new tech! A Decentralized Government is born and we can finally have rules without rulers! peoples votes actually count (no fraud because it is on a blockchain and cant be manipulated or rigged by outsiders. 
we the people do need laws (no killing/ stealing/ insider knowledge) but we do not need rulers.  people are incentivized through monetary means to do good to get them out of poverty instead of the ladder. 
Id like to know what you think as well, let me know!
@_date: 2019-03-20 19:00:23
And thats only the 5yr chart, lets see the one from the 1930's  and compare that to BTC
@_date: 2019-03-31 02:27:58
Bitcoin and friends!
@_date: 2019-11-07 21:03:44
So is coinbase, but they require KYC/AML
@_date: 2019-03-04 16:50:48
Its also not for beginners.. 
@_date: 2019-03-05 19:50:40
The cash app doesnt allow your to take your btc off of the cash app?
@_date: 2019-03-28 15:32:23
not to put this down, because its a really good idea, but that's usually against the games policy or TOS, any other additional ideas? 
@_date: 2019-03-08 16:59:11
literally came here to say this, thank you!
@_date: 2019-03-05 20:13:42
How has your experience been with the cash app?
looking to migrate away from coinbase..
@_date: 2019-03-04 20:25:28
This is fucking awesome!
@_date: 2018-10-26 19:17:11
@_date: 2019-03-15 00:28:34
Thank you, and in my opinion, I consider atomic swaps as interoperable, not sending them to a third party to have them exchanged and given back.
@_date: 2019-03-22 17:45:32
*found a computer from 2010 in a dumpster with 10k BTC on it*
aka TREASURE
lmao 
@_date: 2019-03-04 16:43:52
Do you use this regularly? what is your experience? good or bad, Id like to know!
@_date: 2018-10-26 18:12:07
Restrictions? 
thats weird.. i don't remember BTC having any restrictions.. 
seems like there's a better alternative out there... :D
@_date: 2018-10-11 15:10:33
Just out of curiosity, how do you feel about the article that came out saying that china owns 70 - 77%of the mining network on BTC, do you think this will effect the LN?
@_date: 2019-03-22 15:02:01
welcome to the club of people who enjoy sound money :)
@_date: 2019-08-22 13:24:27
just curious, how many pages?
@_date: 2018-06-28 04:36:14
So what’s the largest dollar amount you can do without having to give your address or last 4 of SS
@_date: 2019-08-19 13:22:54
Sucks to hear, at least you have an alternative outlet!
@_date: 2019-08-19 03:51:16
You are definitely able to withdrawal from cash app to another wallet after you verify the KYC
@_date: 2019-10-12 23:01:38
A lot of coins have good road maps and look desirable, I’d stick with btc and eth tho for now
@_date: 2019-10-04 17:45:44
Better than a lambo IMO
@_date: 2019-06-19 17:09:17
Bitcoin is already much more valuable than a dollar, 1 bitcoin is over 9000 dollars at the time of me writing this
@_date: 2019-06-20 02:28:29
not ignorance no, I live in the real world where the currency symbols that make you cry are used. enjoy your dreamland.
@_date: 2019-02-26 14:48:52
*just don't sell*
@_date: 2019-02-28 16:18:03
anyone switch over to the cash app? from square inc.?
@_date: 2019-06-19 21:01:24
Oooo I can see all those currency symbols used daily as a medium of exchange make the tears roll down your face , can you wine some more and cry some more please, that’s what we all need here on the internet ����
@_date: 2019-02-15 17:55:50
Support SUB then, but they just got delisted from binance 
@_date: 2019-12-19 19:04:10
Anyone have a link to their website?
@_date: 2019-02-10 00:51:14
If you coinjoined the dust with some of your own, would you effectively “lose the trail” and keep the dust as a profit?
@_date: 2019-12-24 14:56:02
I'm in if he changes it from the bcash symbol to the actual BTC symbol
@_date: 2019-10-12 21:35:38
I would recommend you purchase a cold wallet such as  ledger nano s.  I also would recommend you buy it from their own website  
@_date: 2019-04-24 16:34:57
I hope you're right!
@_date: 2019-04-17 19:28:59
it should read "Jihadists in Syria turn to easiest way to immutably transfer value across borders to raise much-needed funds"
@_date: 2019-04-24 18:02:17
Yea, I think he has a couple screws loose up there
@_date: 2019-04-15 18:47:46
You're inviting new users to "get rekt on Robinhood"?
@_date: 2019-04-23 12:41:46
Atomic swap from bitcoin to monero (or Maybe litecoin in the future if they implement privacy functions) to make a private payment
@_date: 2019-04-04 20:39:42
So .00000000003 Btc?
@_date: 2019-04-29 13:26:53
I just made a new wallet this morning and it seems pretty awesome, and they just added a feature to help you find nearby bitcoin atms, that’s pretty sweet!
@_date: 2019-04-24 14:47:34
I agree, not sure why he would all of a sudden decide to disclose the real identity of Satoshi now.. makes no sense
@_date: 2019-04-04 16:46:36
So 3 satoshi's?
@_date: 2019-04-24 15:25:05
Which makes it odd that McAFee would want to do this considering his 1 million dollar Bitcoin prediction
@_date: 2019-04-16 18:10:24
I favor this idea!!
@_date: 2019-04-25 11:58:35
Lmao, this legit put a smile on my face, thanks kind stranger!
@_date: 2019-04-23 16:03:50
@_date: 2019-04-18 16:35:25
Amazing! came here to say the same thing!
and Bloomberg has an agenda, which is to make as many people as possible believe crypto wont last without them, obviously this isnt true!
@_date: 2019-04-16 13:29:52
time to stop using coinmama
@_date: 2018-11-28 20:21:43
I WON!!!!
@_date: 2018-11-07 20:04:27
Except democrats love the fed.. 
@_date: 2019-04-15 17:09:11
we shouldn't be recommending things like robinhood to new users tho, even if it's easier,
not your keys, not your bitcoin. even if coinbase is bad on the inside, at the very least you can withdraw your coins. 
its all about education
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:57:50
Yes I agree, however for the average user/eventual consumer, they have no idea what a bitcoin mixer is. this concept needs to be built into the protocol itself or into sidechains, or into wallets whenever you send/ receive.  you can not actually rely on someone like my grandma to send bitcoins through a bitcoin mixer on the regular. non tech people just don't have this knowledge
@_date: 2018-11-09 15:52:39
*Not fungible, change my mind..
@_date: 2018-11-10 16:29:21
I think you are misrepresenting what the word fungible actually means, you're referring to the fact that 1 bitcoin will always be 1 bitcoin, the fungible property is not prevalent in  bitcoin because although every bitcoin is "the same" as every other bitcoin, the past can be traced and you can tell which bitcoins were used where and for which activities
therefore, regulators could in fact trace back bitcoins that were used on the silk road and tell the people holding them that those particular bitcoins were used in illegal activities and then money laundered into the system and effectively black label those particular bitcoins making them worthless.
this is where the fungible properties are lost
if a government or regulating body can trace the history and effectively black label certain keys that were used for wrong in the past, then bitcoin has lost its fungible properties. 
there needs to be a way to ensure that there will be no discrimination over the origin or history of your coins, lessening the worry of potential blacklisting by exchanges or vendors.
@_date: 2018-11-30 17:13:36
This is where the use of real, easily usable, btc settled decentralized exchange could come into play. if the exchange is truly decentralized this would allow anyone to participate in the real market and give little cares for the "paper market".  I believe we have a fighting chance!
@_date: 2018-11-05 20:51:24
Still owned / business operated by central authority, additionally, if you were to sell your crypto thats "backed by gold" would you get real gold in return.. doubtful at best 
@_date: 2019-01-08 16:44:04
Use on a desktop..
@_date: 2018-11-16 20:57:07
Also the thing is, until it is written into bitcoin, bitcoin by itself for the average user is not fungible 
@_date: 2019-01-15 20:43:19
Dont cash out.. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 14:27:53
Thank you!
@_date: 2019-01-06 19:56:13
Just curious, when you gifted it to them, did you have them download a wallet app on their phone or did you gift it on a ledger s type deal? 
@_date: 2019-01-17 20:07:54
Anyone know if you are subject to AML/KYC if you choose the BTC option?
@_date: 2019-01-20 23:45:53
Eww 
@_date: 2018-11-05 19:36:35
Bcash's value, imo, went up on news that they were going to send a decent amount of BCH to a burn address, supply and demand would make the value go up based just upon this, lowering the supply 
@_date: 2019-09-17 17:19:45
No, I believe he means, its "quicker" because you don't have to plug your offline wallet into a computer to transfer your money. (imagine having your offline wallet but no computer to plug it into at the time you need it) 
the transactions occur at the same pace whether it online or offline
@_date: 2019-09-17 15:43:32
VPN's are an ABSOLUTE MUST on public wifi
@_date: 2018-04-03 12:21:36
Do you know the name of the ATM operator that’s by you by chance? The one that’s by me is digital mint, so I’ll be looking for other atms that are not operated by them.
@_date: 2018-04-03 12:14:04
This actually helps, I don’t have friends that use btc yet so it’s hard to find someone that I can pay cash to, but I will look for other machines in my area. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 12:22:50
Do you remember the name of the atm operator that you used by chance? (The one is used was digital mint, so I’ll be looking for different ones)
@_date: 2018-04-03 14:31:42
Thank you! I will look for those in my area. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 12:18:14
Haha this is partly true, but truth be told I’ve never heard of bisq before vrvana’s mention
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:23:42

Trump also wants to get rid of the FED,
pick one bro.. either way, buying BTC as a hedge sounds like the perfect plan :)

@_date: 2019-05-13 19:24:55
honestly if you don't need it, wait 10 years and then sell, but by that time, you probably wont have to sell in order to buy whatever you're wanting to buy
@_date: 2019-05-10 17:42:31
This! no wonder this guy who wants big government doesn't want btc to succeed.

@_date: 2019-05-13 17:44:16
dropbit or BRD are both good ones

Watch some of Andreas Antonopoulos's videos on youtube, there a bunch of info there and he's really good at explaining the pros and cons in a very clear way that most people can understand.
@_date: 2018-12-19 15:56:46
look now haha
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:12:29
NYSE and ICE put millions into and are about to be launching BAKKT, I seriously doubt Trump would try to hinder wall street making an effort to make money
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:14:12
wouldn't it be more wise to instead make btc legal tender and to tell Americans to buy some to keep American dominance?
