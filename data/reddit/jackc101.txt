Looked at your comments and posts. Man do you love BitStamp 
@_date: 2016-04-03 22:14:43
I don't believe you can unfortunately, most docs will not be released and you won't get a searchable database.

Yeah it appears so, what banks are they using do you think? Hopefully with PSD2 coming it might clear the way for more Bitcoin acceptance by the banks.

By a front end seller to a European market do you mean trader on localbitcoins? I've heard many stories of how, coinbase and circle have closed users accounts when they transferred coins directly to localbitcoins

Prediction: Not one politician/banker will go to jail. Instead, media will call for more surveillance &amp; ban encryption/bitcoin

And I guess they won't be granted access to faster payments if they start working with Bitcoin companies?

Coincidence? I think your answer is right here.

Great list!

Doesn't Coinbase and other exchanges have bank accounts in Estonia?

Ah that makes sense, just doubled checked there and Uphold no longer has a banking relationship with Metro, it now displays a bank in Portugal.

I find the article offensive. Even the title I find offensive:
"Worry Not, Refugees: Bitcoin Could Be a Solution"

If you are looking at BTGreece.com that volume is most definitely incorrect.
Check out -  (BTCGreece is run off btctrader) 
And the limits for deposits and withdrawals on BTCGreece.com itself would not allow for this kinda volume.
Also interesting to note, BTCGreece founder Thanos is the same guy that was meant to bring 1000 ATMS to Greece,
They haven't brought one yet.

This company is fascinating. I used Bitreserve a lot when it was first launched. It had zero fees. I had maybe 30k sitting in my account and went to withdraw some Bitcoin one day after they have re launched as Uphold at there was a 0.5% fee for withdrawal. The fee is not huge but it was just the way they introduced the fee, while still claiming to be free to use. Moved all my coins from there since.
Came across this article before, sounds extremely sketchy. Uphold seem to have a great team, spotted they were hiring recently too. Voxelus likewise seems to have a solid team. Everything else though points to a scam. 
Don't think you can compare it to Paycoin, as that was clear cut scam. This has more dept too it. Looking forward to seeing how it will play out.
Vox was trading at .40 cent on Bittrex before they had to pause trading. Only place you can purchase VOX now is on Uphold, set price of .60 cent. Just incase anyone was thinking of throwing a few dollars into VOX, I'd take a better look.

Isn't the Bitcoin feature with stripe only available for US merchants?

"You currently need a US bank account to accept Bitcoin payments"
@_date: 2016-06-03 14:53:20
Last time I checked you had to have a US bank account. Might have changed since, that was a couple of months ago.

Can you explain how this actually works in practise? How does 'inserting a blockchain' eliminate the settlement time?
I guess I don't understand the blockchain.

I've been using number26 for my day to day banking and they are great. Fantastic to hear they don't mind Bitcoin related transactions. How is your experience with them?
