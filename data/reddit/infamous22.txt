We just had a huge run... I'm not saying I know what this is but my best guess is simple.  PROFIT TAKING.  50 is a nice psychological level to sell in front of especially if you own a huge amount of coins.  Now we will see the prices hopefully consolidate to a tighter range and settle down for at least a couple of days.  When it breaks that range hopefully its back to the another upside march.

If it gets through 50 and doesn't get slammed back down instantly.... see you at 75

You are both right and wrong.  I like going to the casino with at least some knowledge of the odds.  But in all seriousness I have found BASIC technical analysis incredibly useful for short term trades.  Now if I were talking about investing and justifying it with "fibonacciing and oscillating" it just gets ugly and you completely nailed it.

Haha yeah exactly.  No panic anything just slow and steady

Just a rant... I am guilty of sounding like those idiots at times also.  Actually the first time they talk about the bit coin on cnbc will be hilarious watching them try to explain what they are.

They are and they aren't (talking all technical terms not just "walls")  If you are actively trading the stock they have small meaning.. If you are investing then they are completely meaningless.  That being said because there is a "buy wall" doesn't mean it will go up.
