General consensus seems to be that price goes up so in reality we can expect it actually goes down ;)

If there are no hodlers there won't be any BTC millionaires either. Someone need to pay this show and they are hodlers. When music stop there is no chairs for everyone... so be fast when it happens.

Was there competitors 2010? There was only Bitcoin. If you have done any research lately you would see that there is not much time anymore left for Bitcoin before new and better technologies will replace it. These new technologies came to the cryptogame just 1-2 years ago. Bitcoin isn't technology that can fulfill future crypto needs for people. Its just too clumsy. Hope you didn't invest your all money on it.

You are living like golden times of VHS and saying "I know about all those digital things you are talking... they are for kids etc...". Look about VHS market cap!
You forget one important fact. People behind these new technologies live here and in this reality knowing what kinds of problems we need to solve in the future and what kind of needs people have. They know also what are the pros and cons of Bitcoin. You believe in Satoshi like some people believe in God. Good for you, keep believing. I believe facts and world that is continuesly evolving. Bitcoin isn't technology that can be easily developed any further.

There will be plenty of chances to buy BTC below 10k$ in 2018.

I predict that Bitcoin will be replaced with something useful like Ethereum. People have already lost their interest for Bitcoin during 2022. Nobody even tries to create anything new for Bitcoin, because it will be too clumsy compared to much better cryptos. These new cryptos can be used so many other purposes than just building a money pyramid.

Bitcoin is actually just a "bubble", which keeps growing as long as people are pumping money on it. Eventually Bitcoin will explode and people start investing their money to cryptos which are actually useful in their daily life. Bitcoin can't fulfill technological needs what people are looking for. Bitcoin is just too clumsy for that. They can try to "glue things" around it to make it look like attracting technology, but eventually it will collapse.

At the moment no influence. People just follow herd and throw money blindly to same hole. They aren't interested to know facts yet. Some day they wake up when music stops and notice that all is gone... After that some of them might begin to think what this all was about where I invested so much money...

Best part in this Bitcoin story is that most of the people already know it is a bubble.  So called "herd behavior" is controlling people at the moment. People blindly do what herd does. In the end there is no treasure for all... just for few.
