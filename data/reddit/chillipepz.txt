There's a lot of anti-capitalist anarchists that would strongly disagree with that! Anyway, I'm not very interested in politics. Perhaps you should take a short course in politics if it interests you, there's some gaps in your knowledge, to put it lightly. I've said enough on the matter, it's getting off-topic, this is a Bitcoin sub.

Because coinbase is going into a mad frenzy with people dumping life savings, credit cards, loans and all sorts into ATH BTC. It's beyond market sanity so the other exchanges are rejecting it and decoupling.

Most people have a basic understanding of how it works. The key concepts of a distributed ledger are not so alien to someone who has used bittorrent, for example. Neither is the concept that it requires a significant amount of hashing power to brute force crack a password, for example. That's most of us, and with some research nearly anyone can reach that level of understanding.
When it comes to actually reading and understanding the source code, and fully technically being aware of each process and function that is occurring, I imagine that is a fraction of a percent of people in the space who understand on that level.

I think libertarianism is too antiquated a way to describe bitcoin in an ideological sense.
"Ripping power from the state" as you describe it almost inevitably ends with a power vacuum where the ones with the most violent power take their place.
Bitcoin is the start of a revolution in which we ascribe our trust and security to provable mathematics and open source code/autonomy instead of other humans. It's the start of a trend in this direction which will continue into other areas. This is not libertarianism. It is trust in code and mathematics over the state through consensus, replacing a state construct (money) without the need for violence, robust enough to resist state interference. This will replace other sectors managed by the state such as energy over time, money was the proving ground and it's been an overwhelming success.

Haha. I like the analogy (though it's not comparable to bitcoin price really)
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:42:27
Those calculations are based on current USD price and difficultly, neither are constant. I've been out of the BTC mining scene for a while but in general the difficulty will likely increase as more people start using these new chips and the usd price is at ATH levels so we may see correction if price follows the pattern that it has done since inception.
However, they are brand new ASIC chips and mining is a fun project to get into. You will likely make ROI and be in profit actually, but as much profit as just buying coins on dips and holding, uncertain. ROI as quick as current calculators say, also uncertain.
I personally wouldn't buy a large investment in BTC at these current ATH levels though. It's complicated! I mine ALTs with GPUs and I've noticed BTC has become a lot more profitable to mine on the comparison sites  Usually BTC is way down the list of profitability, either a price correction or large diff increase seems likely in the short to medium term. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:10:02
Some points: Big, stable governments won't create their own crypto-currency. We already have efficient digital government payments in the form of contactless cards and bank transfer etc. It's a waste of time.
Making bitcoin illegal if it becomes a systemic threat is possible, but that doesn't mean people will stop using it - it's highly censorship resistant, governments can't actually stop bitcoin unless they 51% or crack sha256. 
Will there be another big crash? Who knows, the chart patterns say there will be but there is also some new and unusual patterns forming in the BTC/USD chart. I sold some 1000% gains, everyone has to lock in profits somewhere, or what's the point? (Despite the 'HODL' mentality.) 
There must be a lot of whales who bought a year ago just waiting for the right moment to lock in profits and dump. I think a lot of noobs and weak hands will sell at a loss if a crash happens like always.

Bitstamp for major coins and bittrex for all the ALTs. Both AML/KYC compliant exchanges with good security track-records. (Bitstamp did have a 'hot wallet' hack years ago but repaid all customers quickly which actually made me trust them more in the end.

Have you tried repeating the process to see what kind of malware? Is it a clipboard address flipper or something new? Doesn't the exchange give you any confirmation with the address to check before funds are broadcast? My exchange for example sends an email to confirm the transaction with the address in the email on any BTC withdraw. You have to click that link after checking the address (again) to action the withdraw. Are you sure it's not an exchange glitch that you can take up with them?

Orange is unconfirmed transactions with that fee, blue is successful transaction today with that fee. At the very bottom you will see a recommended amount for a fast tx.
Based on that chart at that time an ok fee would be between 80-100 sat/b. Though a lot of the time the fees will be less and rarely when the network is very busy a bit more. 
It's a good site because it is real time and dynamically updates itself based on the network.

I think less volatility than we are used to as bitcoiners, but more volatility than pro traders are used to which is why these big exchanges have been petitioned by their customers to add bitcoin. They want exposure to that volatility in a more controlled and regulated environment.

I don't think so. If there was a ridiculous co-ordinated attempt to tank the price on the futures exchanges eventually it would just decouple from the actual BTC spot price. Could we see a big short attempt and a price dip, sure. Same goes the other direction. But actually harm the network, no, we won't let it happen, it's ruled by consensus. The supply/demand and mining reward network can't be stopped unless all the miners and nodes agree to stop, why would they do that if they've invested in mining.

Paper wallets aren't really secure to be honest. You are exposing your private keys in plaintext at various stages, unless you print them on an airgapped machine and then secure erase the data on that machine and then the printer as well. I don't trust websites to generate them at all. They are annoying to restore as well.
A reasonable way to cold store BTC is to create a bitcoin Qt core wallet on an offline clean Linux machine. Then generate say 10 addresses on the wallet. Export all the public addresses to a text document and keep that on your PC. Backup the wallet.dat file, multiple copies, to 3 different USB flash drives (transcend brand are the best flash drives) and a few CD's and put them in a safe (depending on how much the safe might be overkill) Compare file size of your backups with original wallet.dat make sure matches exactly. Then secure erase the wallet.dat file individually off the Linux machine. Then you can go back online or secure erase the whole drive and reinstall OS.
Then send your coins to the public addresses from the text file in step 1 and they are effectively cold stored. When you want to restore them you just get the wallet.dat file from one of your backups. Check your backups at least once a year and make fresh copies/CD's.

You should buy a new laptop and install a Linux distribution or if you don't know how to use Linux invest in a mac. Don't risk that sort of money on a Windows machine. AFAIK the go-to would be sweep the keys in electrum. I use Qt/core but I don't think you can sweep keys in core.
Coinfloor is legit, but no, I don't know what their fees are or volume. Bitstamp, get verified there, I've had successful SEPA transfers to UK from Bitstamp. They are fast and good with no withdraw fees. Use 2fa.
Whatever you do, don't rush and worry about price changes day to day. For that amount and long term it doesn't matter. It's more important you do this securely than any other priority. Think of a bulletproof strategy to do this, even if it takes a week to plan, and implement it like a mission or you could lose your coins, especially inputting priv keys on an insecure computer.

Cash out up to half, slowly and carefully. Make sure you're receiving fiat accounts are secure. Perhaps arrange to see someone at your traditional bank to beef up security on your account and let them know you're expecting a large deposit. Don't deposit more fiat into one bank account than is covered by insurance (in the UK it's something like 150k per bank account) That means if you transfer more than 150k to one account and someone hacks/frauds your bank account/identity you won't get any compensation over 150k. Don't panic do anything. Take your time, every thing you do detach emotion, be calm and do things very, very carefully and slowly. Use a reputable exchange like bitstamp or gemini with 2fa enabled. Coinbase is swamped with noobs rn.

Your "suspicion" is wrong (and a bit offensive).
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:26:01
Hey. The site gives a high estimate, also the graph can change quickly so it probably has a calculation like (minimum fast fee +10%) to be flexible to sudden fast changes. That is mostly for merchants like bitpay who are fussy about fees or people who want their transaction fully confirmed in 10 minutes or so. Also for new people making their first transactions who are a bit impatient and panicky.
Also the reason there is big "walls" at certain fee levels is because that is probably what the big wallets automatically recommend so lots of transactions at that level. A good strategy is to nip in a bit higher than those orange walls but lower than the recommended fee, it will still be fast. Or if you have a transaction that you don't care how long it takes at all you can put a much lower fee 21 sat/b for example, it will almost certainly still confirm but it might take a day or something. I made a transaction the other day by mistake at 15 sat/b! I was kicking myself thinking it's stuck for days but it still confirmed after a few hours.

The fact it's a company means they can just shut up shop at any moment and declare bankruptcy/insolvency. The implications for crypto are debatable but it's more likely that a lot of people will get ripped off and lose money rather than have a big effect on bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:33:15
80-100 sat/b is where there is the least amount of unconfirmed transactions at the lowest rate on that chart. You could pay less and wait longer, or pay more for a faster tx.
Doubling the fees doesn't mean exactly double the speed, it's not an exact science. It's more about choosing an economical fee that will get your tx 3 confs in 1 hour for example.
It is measured per byte size of the transaction. That means it depends how many inputs and outputs your individual transaction has. If you have lots of small amounts of BTC in different addresses in your wallet and you want to send them all in one payment to one address, that is a lot of inputs. So the transaction size (bytes) will bigger in bytes size so more expensive total. 
If you have all the BTC on one address in your wallet and send direct to another address it is less inputs so less size in bytes so you will pay less total.

Although the general rule is "don't leave money on exchanges", this depends on the exchange and your level of cyber-security knowledge. Bitstamp has proven to be secure/trustworthy, I wouldn't trust other exchanges like bitfinex to store funds at all though (I wouldn't even use it). If you know little about security and may have malware on your computer (installed a pirated/cracked version of any software/games/codecs for example) it's better to store coins on a 2fa enabled online wallet/exchange than on a compromised PC that you have control of the private keys.
Blockchain.info wallet with secure password and 2fa is okay but for short term your coins are just as safe on 2fa bitstamp.
Long term: secure, no ssh, firewalled, lightweight Linux box with an encrypted Qt wallet is preferable. If that sounds complicated then it's worth self-learning some Linux basics and cyber security fundamentals, these are transferrable skills that I recommend anyone to learn the basics of regardless.

Basic technical analysis has worked pretty well for the last couple years but the past 4 weeks have broken all the rules. What you're proposing is called swing trading.
If you know TA it's risky at the moment, If you don't know basic TA then it's extremely risky. The market is not conforming and going full bulltard.

I was commenting on the writing style more than the factual content, which seems accurate anyway. By "cash-bitcoin" the writer means spot price or actual exchange price of BTC rather than futures, derivatives or stocks.

Thanks a lot the clarification. I did a small amount of research into futures, heard the old story that in the early days a speculator left a contract open by mistake and had to receive a head of cattle to Wall Street! So by nature everyone will be speculators in BTC futures (and most other commodities it seems). It will hopefully be a spectacle, whatever happens - I've learned to detach emotion as much as possible from what happens in the market, never made a net loss (which is hard to do in crypto, let's be honest) and just enjoy the sideshow!

Be flexible if it freaks you out. Be able to trade in and out of fiat. No one knows what way the market will go. As a general rule though buying a large investment at an all time high is risky, but no one really knows. There is a whole sticky thread here on the homepage about it you should read.

A lot of newcomers (including myself a few years ago) think/thought that mining is the best way to enter the market. All roads lead to Rome (getting bitcoin) and mining can be a risky and cumbersome way of getting there.
I bought a butterfly labs miner in 2014 and it was minting 0.01BTC per day (about $5 USD at the time). I mined for a while then flipped the miner on eBay for a nice profit when the BTC price spiked to $1k. Within months the miner was not profitable as new ASIC chips came out and diff increased x100+ and BTC crashed to $350.
It might be better to start buying Bitcoin on the dips and building up that way. After all the maths is done you'll likely end up with more coin simply buying BTC with the miner money. 
My friend spent £6000 on a miner in 2015 and electricity costs were more than he was mining. He's kicking himself now cos that £6k could have bought him about 15 BTC at the time and the miner is just there not being used. I advised him to buy BTC instead, but he was insistent on getting the miner.

You're welcome! It's been interesting for me to have a quick look at the BTC mining developments too. Sounds like a plan, as long as you're able to monitor developments in ASIC's, mine the most profitable coins and be flexible in re-selling hardware at the right time it should be good. After reading some facts I'm neutral on the idea, it is a good way to get deeper into the tech and mining is usually a fun educational pursuit regardless. All the best with it!

Weird. Is it bitpay? AFAIK the blockchain wallet has a recommended fee which is usually accurate, not sure about the mobile wallet though. You could post a link to the txid or check on the blockchain what fee was on the transaction. It should be at least about 55 sat/b. Otherwise it might be a processing issue on overstocks side, or bitpay being too fussy about low fee tx's.

The only way to record something on the bitcoin blockchain is with a tx. It's not uncommon for people to send a dust payment for sanity check before sending a larger amount.

What you propose is a lot of work to implement. It's simply not big enough a problem to devote any sufficient amount of resources for a solution.
There are more efficient alternatives which people are already using in the real world, such as sending a dust payment first.
It's common practice to check the first and last 4 characters in the address and a random bit from the middle to verify it's going to the right place. The more  transactions you send, the less the anxiety about mismatch over time. I've been using crypto since 2014 and never sent to the wrong address with 100's of tx's. My first tx's I triple quadruple checked, now I do a quick look and one double check using the above method for sanity check (unless it's a large amount then I'll check 3/4 times)
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:11:32
Laborious for the development team, obviously. Because it's not currently a problem, so it would be a waste of resources to 'solve'. That is the reason not to do it.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:37:58
I doubt this is true anyway. If you had the intention of capitalizing on an error you would have withdrawn in BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:22:37
Maybe, it's not uncommon for computer nerds to get stuck in an echo chamber/bubble with each other where they underestimate how little the general public knows broadly about computer science. It's risky for people with zero knowledge to get involved at the moment as securing and keeping your bitcoin requires at least basic knowledge of computer security. But then maybe not, with trezor/coinbase etc. maybe I'm old-hat thinking you need to know a bit of computer science.

Shellshock? Mac only as a last resort other than windows is what I was getting at.

@_date: 2017-12-05 14:28:47
Thanks for the insight, esp. hard limits per trader. I also understand they would first have to buy the contract in order to be able to sell it. So who will the first sellers be seeing as no bitcoin reserves are required to sell? I suppose it's all in fiat so if Bob had X amount of fiat he could start a sell contract in relation to his fiat reserves? But the buyers can use leverage/debt to buy? It's rather confusing! But your summary is correct, prepare for anything and expect some manipulation is my current position. I also wonder if the "big 3" (Stamp, Gdax/coinbase, Gemini) have agreed to halt trading at 20% in line with futures, or there could be a major decoupling.

Most wallets, both desktop and online have automated recommended fees inbuilt every time you send a transaction. Blockchain.info, bitcoin Qt, btc.com etc etc all have automated fees based on network.
You're using coinbase to send the tx, that's the problem. Coinbase isn't really a wallet it's an exchange.

Some really advanced malware has been found in common video/image file types, that's beyond the technical ability of non-state actors so if you got that you have bigger problems than losing BTC. If you're just using a tor IP to download mainstream torrents so your ISP doesn't know then it's low risk. I think something like Amazon prime video or Netflix is a lot easier and less risky though. Your ISP can still see a lot of (encrypted) tor traffic on your account which can raise flags. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:43:44
As long as you can dodge all the malware on the torrent sites, fake* download buttons, and don't install any "codecs (aka malware)" then it's likely OK. Cracked software/games? Absolutely not, all has malware.

This question is a bit off topic to bitcoin, however for multiple GPU rigs the first consideration is always the wattage of your PSU, you'll need at least a steady 750w PSU with enough PCIE power for your cards. Look for calculators online (cooler master has one) to estimate what PSU you need.

There may be some truth to what you're saying, but all exchanges are having delays. Just look at people flipping their lid over coinbase deposits and others. There has been an unprecedented increase in demand on all services. I'd rather they did things slowly and carefully than fast and insecurely.

If you do know what you're doing with PC security then do a fresh linux install and BIOS update on your current PC and that will likely be alright. But if you can why not reduce the risk as much as possible for that amount, the more risk you eliminate the less stressful it will be, you'll feel more confident about it. Also make sure you disable remote access, ssh, file sharing etc enable firewall on your Mac/Linux box.
There have been serious zero days on all operating systems including Linux Mac and Windows in the past year so it should be a fresh, updated install.

Defensive false/untrue analysis of the core motivation of your actions followed by excuse/false reasoning. Ask a psychologist or spend some time introspectively and it will hopefully become apparent to you as it is to everyone else that all your posts are an expression of jealously, or perhaps, ignorance of the technology (or both). Those who enter bitcoin as a gamble will learn by experience, those who deeply understand the technology and its potential will likely prosper. Commentators who don't understand the technology or have not invested time in learning about it are obvious to those who have. "Donny, you're out of your element"

So was litecoin, but they didn't add the trading pair for 5 years. Historically they do things very slowly, in a predictable way and make announcements long in advance.

@_date: 2019-01-10 12:19:30
There's probably sufficient upload bandwidth already for the syncing full nodes on the network (like some rarer/less downloaded torrents) and yours is just redundant at the moment. I've had the same before when running full nodes of popular coins. You're still contributing to the network none the less through validation afaik. I'm not sure exactly how the wallet is programmed to select whose nodes get used for the upload when syncing. Probably programmed to prioritize nodes that have been stable on the network for a long time with the same IP as a guess.

Is there any specific reason you need to build from source? As you're using Windows and Ubuntu I assume open source purism isn't the reason? 
An easy way to get bitcoin core running in Linux is to:
- download, check integrity with sha256sum, and extract the already compiled tar file
- in the extracted folder find the file called bitcoin-qt, drag that file into an empty terminal and hit Enter to launch the application. You can then just launch the wallet from that same method every time.
Compiling is useful for learning purposes or open source purists with the bitcoin core wallet but the signed releases are fine for almost all users. If you do have some specific reason then of course that's fine but if you want your QT wallets (including other cryptos) up and running quickly in Linux the above method is the fastest.

It is easier for those you first described to call it a "scam" and in some ways understandable as bitcoin hailed a paradigm shift in economics. They are probably used to seeing lots of things that are actual scams, advertised as making unusual gains, so they put crytpo in that category based only on that. When/if they do more research, some are humble enough to accept the validity of the market, some enter, some throw their hands up and declare "not for me, I don't fully understand it" (sensible), some are so bitter they missed out that they use the opportunity to to smear bitcoin at any opportunity.
