Most likely even if you can deposit and play, when you try to withdraw they will want to confirm your ID

You completely have missed the point of bitcoin, not to be delusional, there is competition for bitcoin, but no closed source cryptocurrency is dangerous for bitcoin.

Never trade with instant purchase, make stop-limit order, where you fix the price
You will have to look the order book, in example the price is 1160$ and you will buy 2 bitcoins with instant order, but in order book there only 0.5 btc with price 1160 and 1,5 with price 1170, then the price for you is of 1167.5
Same if you sell, there can be buyer with 1170, but be buys only 0.5, next order is for 1150, for 1.5 bitcoins, then you sell your coins for 1155.
There are also fees, but they are not 50-100 dollars

Too bad you will still have to trust these organizations, and government can still block access to your account. Too bad these organizations work from 9-5. Too bad if somebody goes to this organization and pretends to be you, and withdraws all your deposited cash

So you agree with me




Same way cops can arrest you and request to freeze your bank accounts without proven guilty first




You are right




They have these mechanism because that has happened before and will happen again

I have been using the card for last two weeks without issues. 
Last time I transferred crypto to card, their website was quite slow, but hopefully its growing pain and they can handle the traffic better.

They don't have their own bitcoin wallet, but you can transfer bitcoin and some other (btc, eth, ltc, bcc, btg) and it will be converted to eur/dollar which you can spend with card

Feel free to ask questions in this thread, because PM with strangers on money topic is not the best idea. Creating a wallet and backing it up can be teached/learned without sharing any personal data

You are right. You also don't need to run PayPal server to make a transaction there. So why would I use bc if I could use PayPal which is accepted in more places?

1) I don't have any reason to oppose SegWit - only reason that I can think of is that its not scaling solution that can scale to Visa, but it opens up possibility to deploy lightning that can scale to it.
2) I oppose Bitcoin Unlimited because its not only a big block solution - its an codebase that has been forked away from core long time ago, and as we have witnessed multiple times, they have released buggy, untested software. I have no reason to run this code in my computer.
3) Like said in 2, I would leave BU out of comparison and would compare on-chain and off-chain scaling solutions. Simple calculation would show that on-chain solutions can't get us to Visa volume unfortunately, it would be the best solution, but its simply impossible. So off-chain solution must be implemented to get the global coverage. That means SegWit is currently only real solution to future issues, just raising the cap would lead us to same dead lock situation in the near future
