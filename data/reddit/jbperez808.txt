At the rate the politics are going, the most likely outcome will be the original scenario of Litecoin being the silver to Bitcoin's gold.
Bitcoin stays on 1MB and becomes a "settlement currency" for big transactions, while Litecoin takes over as the "everyday currency".  
Litecoin operates very much like Bitcoin and thus will be quite familiar to deal with - this applies not only to end-users but also those programming the ecosystem around it. 
It then has the added advantages of confirming much faster and being far cheaper to transact with.

OBVIOUS FAKE. C'mon people...

$200 worth of diskspace (8TB) can store over 19 years worth of FULL 8MB blocks so these so-called centralization fears are hogwash. The reason fewer people are running full nodes is not because of diskspace or bandwidth capacity but rather because it's a hassle to set up a PC just to use bitcoin. 
Limiting blocks to 1MB will not convince them to keep using a PC nor will increasing the blocksize by a modest amount cause those who prefer to run full nodes to stop doing so. 
Moreover, this ideal of needing to run so-called full nodes is a very *narrow* point-of-view. MANY MANY MANY people use Bitcoin for other properties, namely cheap (well, at least previously) transfers, incorruptible store of value, and fast global transfers. Some of these properties are being destroyed by the extremist focus on keeping blocksize small.
There needs to be a balance between onchain capacity and offchain. If we find ourselves needing to go to 16MB blocks before they become affordable, then Layer 2 solutions Lightning can help ease the load. But otherwise, there's no need to go chicken little due to overblown fears of 'centralization'
Core's extremist stance re onchain capacity is just fueling the suspicion that they don't want people transacting onchain and instead become FULLY reliant on Lightning Network hubs instead. (Only the so-called suits and shareholders will be able to afford to transact on the expensive onchain settlement layer) That is NOT Bitcoin.
Remember that Lightning has its own centralization issues and a very different security/censorship model that is nowhere near as well understood as onchain txes so we don't want to be forced to use that all the time.
@_date: 2017-05-14 16:27:23
But it WASN'T! At least not until you guys at Core refused to increase the blocksize in the face of increasing usage. 
I also find it interesting that you're now admitting that transactions have become a lot more expensive while denying it for the longest time in the face of overwhelming evidence.
That comment about information from "blockchain.info being likely bogus" is just more proof of how deaf Core is.  You blindly convince yourself that our technical vision is the only valid one while ignoring the needs &amp; wants of the REAL majority of Bitcoin users.
@_date: 2017-05-29 05:52:05
Miners don't mind lower tx fees, as long as there are more txes. 
That's why they want blocks that can hold more transactions.
Higher onchain capacity also means more people benefiting from Bitcoin proper (not Lightning which has very different characteristics and still poorly understood by end users and thus not likely to see quick adoption), so bigger blocks are good for Bitcoin's health overall.
The main people who do understand what's going on and still want small blocks are those with a fetish for full nodes which they will still be able to run, but will require just a few dollars more investment.
They want everbody else using Bitcoin to suffer so they can indulge in being cheapskates.
@_date: 2017-05-05 04:24:05
Yes, that noise being "increasing the capacity by N times is reckless and irresponsible"
We forget that that is just equivalent to *removing a temporary cap* that Satoshi put on earlier.

It's far cheaper to set up a "full node" as opposed to adding hashrate to the network.
The sybil (false identity) attack comes when a bad actor with big pockets fields a lot of cheap full nodes and then claim that they have the so-called "vote".
Full node 'votes' are cheap to buy, cheap to subvert, whereas it is far more expensive to purchase hashrate.  
The hashrate-based vote shows REAL SKIN IN THE GAME, the 'full node' vote should only be seen as indicative and must always be *distrusted* especially if there is heated politics (imo, exists primarily because of the treacherous toxicity that is Core) like what is going on right now.
@_date: 2017-05-14 16:17:19
Yes, but you really shouldn't have to.  Unless there were somebody artifically capping the capacity of the network you're using in order to get you to use their own solution. ;-)
@_date: 2017-05-04 12:13:20
"reckless and irresponsible" lol 
@_date: 2017-05-05 04:26:23
What's reckless and irresponsible is trying to foist an overengineered contraption (Segwit) on top of Bitcoin when a simple parameter change is enough. Using slanders and black propaganda to gain support for that move is beyond irresponsible, it falls into the category of being evil.
@_date: 2017-05-21 09:17:52
Ummm... but that's the one of the lynchpin concepts underlying cryptocurrencies!!! 
We trust that those with the most skin in the game and have the most to lose will be the most averse to destroying the value of their holdings!
In fact, proof-of-stake (vs proof-of-work) takes this idea even further.
@_date: 2017-05-29 10:24:25
Ridiculous. If one person is all it takes to influence a major direction in Bitcoin, then Bitcoin is crap.
The real reason is that A HECK OF A LOT OF PEOPLE DISTRUST CORE, know that their antagonism towards big blocks is driven by an ulterior motive (Blockstream wants to create *artificial* demand for Lightning) and refuse to play their games.
@_date: 2017-05-03 08:08:44
There is still no satisfactory explanation why Core wouldn't go with a hardfork 2MB blocksize plus segwit when just about all the major miners were willing to go with it.
LukeDashJr's blocksize "increase" proposal was clearly a troll.
@_date: 2017-05-05 08:01:05
Here, let me try doing it your way. It is reckless and irresponsible to insist on an overengineered solution that requires a lot of code and API changes for wallets and other software in the Bitcoin ecosystem when a simple increase in the blocksize is possible is all that's needed.
@_date: 2017-05-16 17:56:32
I think you're the one who needs other sources of info besides Core propaganda.
@_date: 2017-05-04 10:09:07
I call BS on this.
@_date: 2017-05-21 10:06:25
It's not "sort of the point", it's the ENTIRE point! :D
@_date: 2017-05-21 10:59:28
UASF will destroy Bitcoin.
Funny how the same people warning against and pretending to be deathly afraid of a "contentious fork" are willing to push through a fork that *majority of the hashrate* is against.
How can this not be considered even more reckless?!  Stop being brainwashed by Core.
