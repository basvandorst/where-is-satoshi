Get yourself a good windows box, install bitcoin core, configure some settings such as testnet and RPC access to allow eclair alpha8 to talk to your core node.
Syncing testnet takes a few days on decent internet. You need probably 500GB HD space available or you errors.  It looks like its frozen after around 10 weeks but just leave it, it will continue syncing after some hours.
While you waiting, watch Andreas and grab some Testnet coins from a faucet.  Once it's synced, open eclair alpha8, then find a channel on the lightning network.  Try a few different ones until you get a connection.  Eclair will control your node a bit and send coins and such for channels.
Once you a normal state channel, (takes 6 confirms) you can head over to starblocks and buy a blockachino to sip while you write your next post on yalls to earn more testnet coins for tomorrows digital bevy.

My wife told me to sell at 200, at 400, at 800, at 1,200 then got mad at me after it crashed when I didn't then told me to sell again at 300 and 700 and when it got back to 1,200 again she really really got mad when I didn't sell.
Then she really yelled at me when I didn't sell more at 2,000, at 3,000 at 5,000.
She stopped yelling at me at 8,000. Now she's extra nice at 10,000. She made me a sandwich at 12,000. She rubbed my feet last week at 14,000, which is unusual.

Nope.  The debt stays (and is due) in the original currency.
There was a story a couple of years ago about Russians who had taken out mortgages on their house denominated in Swedish Krona.  The reason they did this was because the interest rate on the Krona was much, much lower than the ruble.
Well it turned out that the Swedish government was losing money each month keeping the Krona pegged to the Euro.  They changed policy and removed the peg.
This caused the krona to skyrocket (especially vs the ruble) and all those Russian Krona-based mortgages defaulted because the borrowers could no longer afford the exchange rate.
It's a crazy world.

With Visa, you do lock up money.  It's your credit availability that you're locking up. Under our current system, the more you lockup the more you pay (in interest charges, until you pay down your balance)
Under the new system, if you choose to lockup funds, then you earn fees on those funds.
As a non-Visa entity, I prefer the new way.
(and anyway whose to say Visa won't loan a bunch of people Bitcoins to lockup in payment channels, so Visa can earn the fees on the coins, and the users just get free transactions, with no interest?)

You can run core AND eclair.  Set up core on testnet and get some coins from a faucet.
When this is working, install eclair, which talks to the core node and opens channels with the testnet coins in the core node.

One of the real pains in the ass for me as a trader is the fact that you have to leave your coins on an exchange to take advantage of the wild price swings.
Leaving your coins on an exchange is dangerous due to risk of theft/shutdown/failure etc which really sucks.
Lightning will let you open a channel to your exchange for super fast near instant transfers to sell quick or transfer them to safety over a long weekend so you can focus on friends instead of phones.
You will always keep control of your coins even when they're on the exchange and the bonus is the channel to the exchange also acts as an on-ramp to the rest of the lightning network so you can pay for rounds and rounds of coffee with profits while only needing 1 or 2 channels.
We are still some time from this dreamland scenario but improvements are happening.

It's a fucking good question.  Something I've wondered about myself.
What if a nefarious agent with deep pockets wanted to centralize the hash power and then run up the difficulty, only to pull the plug, so to speak, and leave the remaining hash power market unable to complete a block for days or possibly weeks?
@_date: 2018-08-29 15:22:27


Hang on now wait a second, I read that difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks not each 2 weeks on the calendar, that can't be right can it?
If so, that would mean someone could up the difficulty x10, then yank their hashpower, so that blocks take 100 minutes (on average) each and the difficulty would NOT adjust for 2016 blocks or 140 days.
In other words, 4+ months of a really slow Bitcoin network.

I did selling BTC.
My bank account got locked, unbeknownst to me, when an old BISQ trade went chargeback.  My current trades then were held up due to the locked bank account.  Arbitration was required.  The BISQ arbitrator made a bad decision and then I lost BTC to another trade.
All in all I wasted hours of set up time.  I lost approx $800 in fiat and crypto using BISQ platform.

Maybe so. This was not the case when I was testing it.  My issues were not just that the platform was infested with scammers. It was the flawed arbitration system.
When thing go wrong (and they will eventually) you are at the mercy of anonymous volunteers who make mistakes.
The scammer can leverage this human error factor by buying up all your trades and hoping the honest party makes a mistake in negotiating with the arbitrator.  The trade deposit amount is low enough that the scammer will profit in the long run.  They won't win all the cases, but enough to make a profit.  At least he did from me.

Its says that Bitcoin is pseudonymous.  That means that users are responsible for keeping their addresses secret.
The user. Is responsible.
Have you ever met an average user?  They are really foolish and naive. 
My point is all it takes is one little mistake, one mixed transaction with a known address, to mess up a users privacy forever.  Eventually a user will do business with someone who will leak the users identity. And then eventually, a user will tie their pseudonymous transactions to the leaked transactions.
Unless the user are planning on HODLING forever.

The security was so brutal.  They had 4 security "guards" patrolling up and down, up and down, over and over at EVERY row making sure no one was using cellphones.  There was probably 20 rows all around the arena.  I watched them all through the show walking up, standing for 60 seconds, check the radio and then back down, over and over.

Simplii and Tangerine are good free alternatives if you need to switch bank accounts for your pay cheque.  Don't use either of these for crypto transactions.
For crypto transactions, **as a hobby**, use RBC or TD.
Never tell a bank what your account is for.  Even in a dispute situation do not mention cryptocurrency.  Just eat the chargeback if you have to.
**Report all CAD profit to CRA on your income tax.**

This person is trying to say that:
**By 2028, 98.4% Bitcoins will have been mined.  Because of the mining reward distribution protocol, that leaves us with approximately 112 years to mine the remaining 336,000 Bitcoins that will be left after 2028.**
There are still ~2,000,000 Bitcoins left to mine between now and 2028. (So stock up while they're cheap!)
    Block 105000 is when 98.4% of all coins mined
    Block ((105000-579032)/52500) years + 2019=~2028
    Year 2140 is the estimated last year of a mining reward.

**I got ripped off twice on BISQ for selling BTC.**
The first one was a chargeback for $300CAD which I didn't know about until my bank account mysteriously stopped accepting Interac eTransfers.
This caused a ripple effect of failures to the next 5 trades already in progress, the last of which resulted in me losing my entire trade amount of $500CAD to an incorrect decision by a arbitrator to a scammer.
I closely investigated each trade after the fact, and I have come the conclusion there are no legitimate traders on BISQ.  Each of my BISQ 'trades' was with an attempted scammer.
Scamming on BISQ is profitable.

Clearly there are bad actors in this space just as there are bad actors in every aspect of human culture. (tx spam, hacks/theft, fraud)


No. It's a setting change. That's it. Literally a hard coded setting to limit spam.  That's all it does.


No one complained because SegWit WAS the upgrade that everyone wanted.  Look.  Mining is a tough game.  No one forced miners to invest millions and millions on hardware.  Lots went bust already.  More will continue to do so chasing their own greed.


There are very, very good reasons for Core to NOT hard fork the Bitcoin network. Please do some research.


Core has authority because the community gives them authority by running full nodes and pointing our miners at those full nodes.




If this is true, you are being reckless with your investments and you should reconsider your life strategies.


No. transactions will definitely be slower.  On both chains. At least while total hashrate is split between 2 forks until the first difficulty adjustment.


Lots of miners don't want 2x and will continue to mine on the original chain.

It depends on where your coins are.  If you are holding on an exchange you will have to check their policy on how they are handling each fork.
If you **hold your private keys before the fork** then you have the private keys for the coins **on both forks** and you have to take care only when you decide to spend them.
You will need to do more personal research yourself for better answers. Check the sidebar for details.

@_date: 2017-11-07 19:00:23
You're right.  This ain't about profit. It's about economic impact.
you got 2 options:
1. mine with inefficient gear and you spend 4 hours labour and $20 dollar in juice and you make $2 in BTC.  Through mining competition, you **deprive** some other efficient miner of earning $2 in BTC revenue, driving up the cost of producing that BTC by $2 for everyone else, and wasting your time and $18 in electricity.
2. buy BTC directly, save your labour and spend it instead and get $60 in BTC. Through economic incentive, you **reward** an efficient miner (actually your ally because he's mining core chain) with $60 of revenue, so he can offset his mining costs
2. *Optional 2b.* Through economic disincentive, you split your 2X coin from your $60 purchase, and dump it to the market (if there is any by time this all happens), thereby lowering price slightly and reducing the reward for mining 2x chain by $60.
In summary, which option will have more economic impact?
Option 1: **$2** (your utility will be happy with the $18 profit, your wife will be pissed with the noise and distracted spouse for a month)
Option 2: **Up to $120** of economic impact towards your goals (and NO noisy gear burning up wasteful eleectricity in ur basement)

Quadrigacx hasn't made a statement but, if experience is any indication, once they figure out how to split the coins into legacy and 2x, they'll probably do what they did with BCH and credit your account with 2xCoin, and profit from the increase in trading fees from people dumping 2x.

@_date: 2017-10-10 19:42:48
I think you have a flaw in reasoning at step 3.  Step 3 should be step 2 because miners follow price, NOT the other way around.
So, Step 2 should be if market says legacy 4K, S2X 1K, then it follows miners will mine at 80/20 split resulting in a 12.5 minute legacy block and a 50 minute S2X block.
My personal opinion is that miners are not going to mine S2X at all.  The difficulty is too high and the opportunity cost on their hashrate is too high.

This pool is back up.  The response to this was unexpected and I had a glitch that I didn't have time to correct yesterday.  Thanks for the interest.  I compiled luke-jr's BIP148 and I compiled ckpool and connected them together to try out my old BFL30.  This is all running amateur-style on my personal gear in my home.
I believe that segwit is the way forward and I'm tired of sitting around waiting for miners to signal 95%.
The purpose is to get a sense of how much hashpower UASF we can garner as well as getting momentum going on a serious UASF pool.  I hope that better programmers can put together a solution.
Feel free to connect and mine on this pool.  It's solo for now, so if you find a block, congrats!

Bitmain + ASICBoost by means of market manipulation and cheap electricity. Where a tiny minority of people with far too much hash power can hold back desirable changes on the entire network. That is a failure of Bitcoins consensus mechanism - the fact that the investment risk they choose to take in this case is irrelevent.
If BIP148 fails a precedent is set that a tiny minority of people can hold changes hostage on the network by mounting campaigns on social media and threatening to allow the original chain languish for selfish profit motive.

It's a market trading thing where your trading account balance gets wiped out and you lose all your money.
This happens when traders uses leverage to amplify their gains.
Unfortunately the downside is that if the price moves too far in the opposite direction of your investment, the exchange will automatically sell all your holdings and empty your trading account of cash to cover the loss.

thanks for the question.  A solo pool is where you connect and mine so you don't need a wallet and you get the stats and stuff.  If your miner finds the block, then you get all the rewards.
'Best share' is a stat inside the mining pool software.  It shows how some info about how much you're mining.
Now that slush is offering UASF mining, everyone is switched to this now.  Good luck mining!

This is good advice, if the plan is to only make profit.  It's what I've done for few years now, just buy Bitcoin and HODL.  But now it's time to step up and show support for protocol upgrades.
