This might lead to exponential increas on addoption. Businesses will avoid exchanging bitcoin into fiat in order to avoid being double taxed. Consequently, this will motivate running businesses in bitcoin only and will accelerate bitcoin adoption on a national level.

yeh, one way in for cash. That is dubaious.

People are getting sick of altcoins alrady. Don't worry, at the end there will be one.

What is Roubi? It is not even on bitcoinwisdom.
@_date: 2014-03-18 15:40:11
One way cash in, BTC out. Something is fishy in there.

unlikely ... they prepared a draft last week. Also give recent crackdown on other non-bank transactions it seems very likely to be real.

china stabilised, might have been a false alarm ...

Yes, indeed. It goes right against what the bitcoin was intended for - transactions. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:06:32
because every transaction must be recorded at the time it was made and in the dolar equivalent at that time. So if you traded 1000 times on an exchange or bought 100 Gyft cards that is a lot of to track.

F*in huobi. They trade without fees. A leaf falls and they are all spooked. Two days ago it was all about QR codes, now some other shit. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:18:59
Bitcoin/fiat and bitcoin/goods transactions. Nothing to do with blockchain.
@_date: 2014-03-25 23:58:03
what's the point to tax it then?

Yes, cleaning of bad apples is a good news. Moreover, Chinese won't be able to exchange for fiat and will have to trade in bitcoins. Good for bitcoin economy. 
Few chinese have access to external banks. So no imediate dump for cash is expected. We are all fine for now.

No, that probably means miners and whales will try to suppress the price before reporting taxes. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 19:02:45
The way I understand it ,yes. Nor Huobi nor OKCoin have fees. That makes it very "wind dependent". Bitstamp and bitfinex order book is 2-3 times deeper and we are still following them like idiots.

The worst panic is when you don't know what you are afraid of;)

They might hard fork the protocol at some point and introduce a smart inflation mechanism like in peercoin's for example.
Otherwise it's a negative feedback loop: more people save --&gt; less transactions --&gt; more demand for coins from businesses --&gt; increased deflationary pressure --&gt; more people save
The big question, of course, will be people willing to switch to inflationary fork.
