* Bitcoin - the network/protocol/blockchain/idea
* bitcoin - coins/currency
* BitCoin - you don't know shit

Based on the table, the above statement is false because network/protocol/blockchain/idea is still here with us. Just the coins are gone.

Moving coins has non-zero costs and security implications. It requires work! Do you want to force me to dig my cryptosteel every year out the ground and then bury it back? ;)
Also the information you would get out of this is not that much useful IMO. I assume you are after "velocity of money" which would help you estimate market value. But knowing number of spendable bitcoins does not tell you the velocity. It just improves your estimates a little bit. People would also have to honestly tell you how much likely they are to exchange their bitcoins for goods and services in the next year. Without this information "spendable bitcoins with no intentions to spend" are indistinguishable from "unspendable bitcoins", because they don't directly contribute to market forces.

@_date: 2018-08-07 20:47:47
The OP is technically incorrect about the work needed to mint BTC coins. 1 BTC is technically 100M satoshis. Each satoshi can be individually tracked back to a specific block which minted it via its coinbase transaction. The work needed to mint a block was determined by the hash rate required at the time via network consensus rules set for proof-of-work. Given this, we can define work needed for a specific satoshi minted in block B with subsidy S as WORK(B)/S. And define the work needed for a specific set of satoshis W(\[set\]) as a SUM of WORK(B\[i\])/S\[i\]. It is not  true that 100\*W(1BTC) == W(100BTC) holds for all sets of 1 BTC and 100 BTC satoshis.

"...why is there no movement in our government to make cryptocurrency standard?"
Assuming bitcoin-like cryptocurrency:
1. The Blockchain is a transparent public ledger. They couldn't continue to do money printing into their own pockets. Unless they make the technology pretty complex and obfuscate what is going on there or they figure some social trick how to explain it to public. Calling it "taxation" would still upset a lot of people.
2. It would enable people to exchange value without a middleman. This is not very desirable for governments. If they build-in some form of censorship - then it is not bitcoin-like.
3. They would lose powerful tools for doing macro-economic interventions - losing weapons in "currency wars"

The first version will have support only for Armory paper wallets. They use Easy16 character set. And you need to fill 72 positions  (2 rows with 9 words by 4 characters).
2 x 9 x 4 x 16 = 1152
Let's assume: when you generate your seed a particular character is not repeated in more that 1/4 of positions (you would regenerate your seed if not)
1152 / 4 
= 288 characters per kit (which is doable)

Well, orphaned blocks are typically caused by incomplete information about latest block (caused by network propagation delays), not by divergence of consensus rules. Orphans because of consensus violation are very rare.
But maybe you are right. Maybe it would work if miners had some back-channel communication about their current consensus parameters (e.g. current block size limit constant) and communicated their intentions to others beforehand (to prevent burning money by stepping outside of "unknown" consensus situation). But to me it sounds more like a poker game, than anything predictable. I'm not a game theory wizard to really see all the consequences.

Thanks for answering. I personally don't share your concerns.
I would like to see various competing technologies (on multiple layers) which will have different degrees of decentralization and other differentiating properties. On free market they can compete side by side.
I'm perfectly ok to track my starbuck-coffee purchases via more centralized but cheaper system (e.g. in 2nd layer LN with centralized hub topology). And on the other hand I want sustainable censorship resistant decentralized p2p cash-like tool for digital-gold-store-of-value thing (e.g. Bitcoin 1st layer).
Segwit is one tangible way how to enable development of such technologies. Let then people decide what tool to use when and for what purposes. Markets will decide the price.

That could be a reasonable compromise. IMO the problem is that core devs won't risk managing a hard-fork. There is no or little reward for them, just a ton of work and a ton of risk. In case of a failure they would have to eat all the blame (even if it wasn't their mistake). BU devs might want to bet on a hard-fork because their reward is potentially gaining major control over future development.
I think we should offer a bounty to a specific core dev (or anyone) to step up and negotiate a compromise which would be technically sound and also politically acceptable for all camps. This person would then take executive action. If successful the bounty would be his reward. Technically each candidate could have a donation m-of-n multisig released by trusted group of high-profile community members.

Supply (the block size) is fixed. Demand (aggregated size of all transactions wanting to be included) is dynamic =&gt; price cannot be fixed.
If you fix the price, you end up with shortages. That's how "price controls" work.
To fix it, think how to make the supply elastic to match the demand or how to make the demand fixed.
@_date: 2016-03-01 18:07:50
Let me show you one possible purpose of those alleged "spam" transactions. Their purpose is to take up block space and raise awareness of the fee discoverability problem. Or the purpose can be anything else, even something we don't know and will never know. So your definition of spam is pointless. Every transaction is accomplishing something while consuming resources. I believe spam cannot be defined objectively, because we could be missing some information which is not available publicly. If I start encoding super-important hashes into blockchain, it will look to you as a pointless consuming of resources, but for me it is extremely valuable usage of blockchain space. There is no judge to really decide who is right. Only the fee market.

I have been running a full bitcoin node over my home connection for 2+ years. And there is a real cost to running it in terms of bandwidth and storage. Bitcoin Unlimited enables miners (hash-power-majority) to select max block size. Increasing the block size will increase transaction capacity but it will have costs. Who will be bearing those costs? All people running the nodes. Not only miners. Don't you think individuals like me will drop out? I'm concerned that there would be less nodes serving the network and that would lead to greater centralization of power.
In other words: Miners deciding the block size is a moral hazard. Because they immediately benefit increasing block size but don't bear all the future costs. Miners are paid for the service of ordering transactions, they are not providing the services associated with the payment network. So they must not have direct control over costs of running the payment network.

Erik's position was well explained in the interview. In my view, he is consistent and has always been.
@_date: 2016-03-02 01:38:57
I agree with you on that. The problem is that we live in real world with technological limits. Some rogue miner could create "too big" block to damage Bitcoin system. So there must be some technological limitation to block size defined. The other problem is the mining centralization problem. So current block size cap must be defined as min(technical-limit, max-allowed-centralization-limit). Exact evaluation and consensus about max-allowed-centralization-limit is the main pain point in the block size disputes IMO.
When we get to situation where technological cap is much higher than usual size of blocks created by miners and there is low risk of running into centralization issues, I believe this will be a sign of healthy system. Both limits can be lifted in future thanks to advancements in technology. The question is how and when.

You seem to not understand that those 3.8GB/4GB is relevant to bitcoind node operators (server people) who want to support Neutrino Clients (people with phones). It has nothing to do with people installing Neutrino-powered apps on their phones.
The only data neutrino client needs for sure are block headers. One block header is 80bytes, so for example blockchain headers up to height 566000 would take circa 45MB uncompressed. Other storage would depend on behaviour of client (how many block filters it requests, if it stores them, for how long etc.)
@_date: 2019-03-31 17:43:39
Well, you are correct, but in case of Bitcoin there is a small technical nuance to your answer.
Losing a private key makes associated UTXO unspendable. Keeping track of all UTXOs means allocating resources. That is why node operators care about UTXO set growth. For example if someone would be creating tons of dust UTXOs and throwing away their keys, technically it would be a problem.

This is what I would do:
* STEP 0) create a new bank account
* STEP 1) write a message that you want to sell bitcoins from a specific bitcoin address and sign the message using private key of that address
* STEP 2) attract potential buyer who is willing and able to do an international wire transfer to your account
* STEP 3) you both select a bitrated agent and use it for 2-3 multi-sig escrow for your bitcoins (
* STEP 4) wait for the wire
* STEP 5) take the cash out (important!)
* STEP 6) release bitcoins from escrow
In general bank transfers are somewhat reversible (hard but doable). Buyer could scam you by reversing the transaction after receiving the bitcoins. Without STEP 5 you would have to trust him, or release bitcoins after longer time, or protect yourself against reversal in some other way.

In my country there seems to be a different loophole which might be applicable in other countries as well.
You can donate your coins to a family member in direct inheritance line (e.g. parent, child, ...). This event has 0% donation tax exception because of direct inheritance line situation (and categorisation of digital currencies as "non-physical movable asset"). That other family member now owns coins with effectively restarted capital gains tax cost base to the exact day when donated.
1. you buy 1 BTC on 1.1.2012 for $10 (cost base $10)
2. you donate the 1 BTC to your father on 1.1.2014. 1 BTC is has market value $100. (cost base reset to $100).
3. your father sells the same 1 BTC on 1.1.2016 for $1000.
=&gt; father's capital gains is $1000-$100 = $900, not $1000-$10 = $990 as it would be in your case.
Please note that if  and  happen on the same day. The father's capital gains is 0.
There are some general rules around donations. For example your father cannot donate it back to you. Or you cannot have direct benefits from the money (it was a non-reciprocal donation, remember?). But this is really hard for gov to track, I guess. It is really an edge case which is not worth investigating unless you convert multiple lambos this way.

I agree with your analysis in general. But storing value in bitcoin is not without risks. There are technological risks (e.g. sudden discovery of breaking ECDSA signatures), there are consensus risks (e.g. community not able to agree which fork is "the real bitcoin") and there are geopolitical risks (e.g. transacting/holding bitcoin getting banned/prosecuted). Everyone has to consider all possible risks including risks of personal failure of securing their keys and compare them to risks/utility/costs of other store-of-value options. And this evaluation is subjective - you cannot claim broadly that "bitcoin is the best store of value (for everyone in the world)".

Commercial banks amplify fiat money but they are "collectively limited" by total amount of idle deposits in all banks, otherwise they would cause hyperinflation. Given a theoretical scenario where there is no change in productivity, money velocity and behavior/preferences of people/companies. And where central bank wants to target zero inflation. Commercial banks will be allowed to print new money into existence only up to the amount of savings sitting idle and not participating in the economy. And they have to unwind this in case the previously idle money starts moving. Central bank has many tools to steer commercial banks into more (or less) lending (e.g. via interest rates). 
Real world situation is of course more complicated. Central banks typically target 2% inflation and with typical peace-time increase of productivity it gives them "free money they can loan and charge interest on" in the ballpark of 5%+ per year (my estimate).

There is no such thing as spam. Anyone should be able to pay to buy space in the blockchain. A no one has moral right to prevent others from using that purchased space however they like. I may find your transactions as less important than mine and even call them a "spam", but that is all I can do about it. Unless I put my money where my mouth is and overbid you in open market and buy that scarce resource instead of you.
A personal observation: There are many people out there who have been selling Bitcoin as "free" payment system over the years. And quite some built their business models around ability to issue cheap transactions (e.g. dice-style gambling sites). It is about time for those services to change business models and for people to realize that trust-less payment processing has non-negligible costs - the mining subsidy is not going to cover it forever. This was clear from the beginning and it was just question of time, depending on adoption, mining difficulty, etc. We could probably double the block size today, but the fundamental problem would remain. Assuming rapid growth we would be in the same situation just at some point later. I believe this "crisis" will accelerate development of overlay networks on top of Bitcoin which will be suitable for many use cases people want from Bitcoin today and now scream they cannot get them for free.

Let's assume an extreme case. All newly mined bitcoins go immediately into miner's cold storage. They will not participate in the market for the next year.

No. Sure, it can be hurt, but not destroyed. You should put *destroy* into quotes, because coin cannot be destroyed in this way IMO.
Let's say those 2-3 companies are called "them" and the rest of the market participants is called "us". By definition "them" are &lt;1% of total market participants but control &gt;51% of bitcoin consensus.
In case of total emergency "us" could fork off from "last good" block height. This new fork would probably be a hard fork which runs exactly the same bitcoin code with a new rule preventing "them" to control consensus. An easy change would be a change of PoW algorithm (an example [1]).
"us" would move to this new fork. "them" would be left with the old fork.
Would this be a messy situation? Hell, yeah.
Would this lead to a fall of bitcoin price? Almost for sure, dramatically.
Would this mean that the Bitcoin as a network is destroyed? Definitely not.

I would disagree that bitcoin token (satoshi) has zero intrinsic value. It allows me to timestamp a hash of data (via OP\_RETURN) to later prove prior existence of digital content aka proof-of-existence\[1\]. And there are other non-monetary uses of bitcoin (a topic for longer technical discussion).
People saying that bitcoins have no intrinsic value are like e.g. African native tribe claiming that gold has no intrinsic value because they never saw it used in a meaningful non-monetary role - they never used it for dental or electrotechnical purposes.

This is my theory. Didn't have time to dig into it deeper.
Git has pretty advanced tools to properly attribute merged commits in a way that it is perfectly obvious who authored the changes, who modified them (and how) and who committed them. The problem is that Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc devs don't use those workflows and simply copy changes from bitcoin/bitcoin repo (plus apply their own cosmetic code-formatting changes) and commit them as if they were authored by them with no mentions of original authors whatsoever.
It is definitely more work to keep original attribution when merging commits especially when both codebases diverged. Unfortunately deadalnix applied automated code reformatting on the forked repo [around Jun 24,2017]( which makes the process of cleanly applying changes from bitcoin/bitcoin to the Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc a royal pain in the ass.
But that's not an excuse. Even in this situation it would be possible for bitcoin-abc devs in their commit messages to carefully mention incorporated commit SHA numbers (or ranges) which would point to original authors. Or even better use tools like git-subtree to automate the process. For example here I have [my own project]( which forked and modified Chrome DevTools codebase. I'm periodically squashing and merging changes from original DevTools into my own codebase with properly auto-generate links to sources. It is [perfectly obvious who authored what]( and where are the changes coming from.

For example I'm pretty sad to see projects like Armory Wallet in limbo because there was no clear funding model for it to get developed and strongly maintained.

If definition of "intrinsic value" of a good is any possible "non-monetary value" of given good, then the answer is simply "Yes, bitcoin has intrinsic value".  
Bitcoin tokens (satoshis) can be used in strictly non-monetary use-cases. For example for publishing a short digital information into append-only non-reversible non-censorable eternal glorious spreadsheet table implemented using data structure known as block-chain. One can use it to do proof of existence\[1\], proof of publication\[2\] or other more sophisticated constructions like single-use-seals\[3\]. These use-cases have provably value for some, e.g. keybase is using proof of existence for anchoring their db\[4\].

Bitcoins can be made divisible to an arbitrary precision. Right now 1 bitcoin is divisible to 100 million satoshis (8 decimal places). A protocol change to refine precision into more decimal places is technically easily possible. Let's assume there is a "problem" of "running out of decimal places", because demand is increasing and long term holders hold and don't let limited supply circulate. Either Bitcoin adds precision on protocol level or if there was no consensus on adding more decimal places and making satoshis divisible (for whatever reason), this would incentivise another cryptocurrency to serve as a silver to Bitcoin's gold. At that point in future we can assume protocol changes will allow seamless cross-chain transfers using 2-way pegs. For example imagine a side-chain which has exactly the same implementation as the Bitcoin's blockchain, but pegs 1 satoshi on the Bitcoin blockchain to 1 "side-BTC" on the side-chain. By implementing this trivial scheme you would easily achieve Bitcoin's satoshis to be additionally divisible to another 8 decimal places, without a need for permission from anyone. Markets would decide.
In other words: this is not a problem.
@_date: 2015-11-01 10:02:10


No. Just by increasing precision, nobody is printing new BTCs so other peoples BTCs have less value. Given all other things equal, value of 1 BTC remains exactly the same. Bitcoin remains fungible so any holder can sell their BTCs and let them circulate. Just the precision changes. There will be nano-satoshis circulating around. So everyone can have their piece of a single bitcoin if they chose so. Maybe they won't be able to own a full satoshi (that would be too expensive), but still they will be able to own some piece of a single bitcoin and transact effectively.
@_date: 2015-11-01 09:30:41
Are you saying that increasing divisibility means increasing total supply?
@_date: 2017-05-09 20:01:21
IMO commodity theory works for Bitcoin just fine. The intrinsic value of bitcoin tokens (commodity) is the ability to publish a short piece of information into a global, distributed, censorship-proof, tamper-proof, append-only, eternal spreadsheet table. This has a real utility in our digital world. For example you can do trust-less *proof of existence* or *proof of publication* with this. Using these primitives you can build digital ledgers and other useful higher-level tools.
In other words. A person who does not know that electricity exists can argue that gold does not have any intrinsic value (let's assume for now that conductivity is the only reason for gold's underlying intrinsic value). Me knowing that electricity is useful and thus making gold intrinsically valuable could 
argue with such people, but from their point of view they don't see the intrinsic value there. But this discussion could not stop gold to eventually develop into medium of exchange because some people start holding it as useful commodity which later bootstraps its function as money (thanks to its other favourable properties).
@_date: 2015-11-01 09:41:52
Indeed. Divisibility is NOT supply. My point is that you don't need additional supply to solve your problem.
As long there is at least 1 satoshi willing to circulate, you can make it into arbitrary number of units suitable for circulation. When you start running out of those new units you can apply the same trick over and over again. Remember: we are talking here about digital commodity. There is no physical-world limit like number of atoms per ounce or something like that, which would render it impractical after increasing divisibility.
@_date: 2015-11-01 10:20:51

The problem was "somewhere between correspondent banks". The same wire details and similar transacted amount worked 6 months ago just fine. Now I'm simply afraid using international wire transfers more than copy&amp;pasting bitcoin addresses ;-)
@_date: 2015-11-01 10:12:20
How it makes BTC less valuable?
By increasing divisibility you increase it universally for all coins. And coins are fungible. 
I'm afraid you don't understand it because for some reason you imagine one "blessed" BTC coin which is promoted into a state of being "more divisible" (aka breakable into more smaller pieces). But this is not the case. All coins in existence start to be divisible in a same fashion and those small pieces will remain perfectly fungible.
@_date: 2017-05-30 21:10:26


The intrinsic value of bitcoin tokens (satoshis) is the ability to publish a new row with a short piece of information (OP_RETURN) into distributed eternal neutral censorship-proof append-only "spreadsheet table". This has clear value as proof of existence or proof of publishing. These primitives can be used for other more sophisticated constructs like digital ledgers or smart contracts.
@_date: 2015-11-01 18:10:26


OP wrote "Coins will end up in the hands of long-term holders (...) so there would be no BTC available."
That reads to me as a pretty clear problem statement.


If I'm completely off-topic why he wrote so many replies in our discussion - instead of just stating that I'm talking about something different?


What are you talking about? I didn't speak about 1-way peg. And by the way 1-way peg is perfectly possible today without any changes to Bitcoin protocol. 1-way peg means to "transfer" coins by destroying them on Bitcoin blockchain in a publicly recognisable way, so that it can be recognised by target blockchain. Please read more details in SideChains white paper, page 6 [1].


Why is it inappropriate to say that? A possibility for 2-way pegs is going to happen in one form or another. And if Bitcoin fails to deliver, it will be in the next cryptocurrency taking its place. Which also solves initially stated problem, because in that case there will be plenty of BTC available ;-)

Source code is not a static thing. It evolves with each update. You would have to be continuously checking all changes. Definitely not something individual users could do. So it means you have to trust someone.
Instead of asking this question, ask yourself if you could setup 2-2 multisig (or similar scheme) and secure your bitcoins using multiple devices/wallets from independent vendors. This would decrease the risk for the price of convenience.
@_date: 2019-05-17 16:54:20
Indeed. Another possible problem is leaking of private key data via side-channels (e.g. via signatures the device computed and which get broadcasted to the network). Even generating your own seed would not protect you against such attack.
You could lower those risks and use some multi-signature scheme with HW wallets from different vendors using chips from different vendors.

There are other options which are more suitable. For example block header hashes.
To me your game looks too complex and laborious. And still I feel like miners could game it. Imagine sky-high fortune in your jackpot (much more than block subsidy). A miner could deliberately place N transactions in his block and then bet on it. Same with postponing release of mined block to satisfy your time bet.
I would recommend you to consider letting people betting on something they already know, but map blockchain-based randomness by doing SHA256(concatenation of following 6 block header hashes). This way you assume no single miner (or collusion of miners) has a realistic chance to mine 6 subsequent blocks to control the result. And by "what they already know" I mean, present them with (for example) normal roulette game, where the resulting hash is mapped to the wheel in a way which is documented and verifiable from blockchain data. You should also think about potential reorgs.
