Yea Coinbase charge fees too, a flat fee + 1.49% so it's to be expect revolut will make money too somehow. Even Robbinhood will offset fees elsewhere so they can promote "free trading"


Well it's 1.05%, like $10 per $1000. It's not even worth the bother as bitcoin goes up 5% a day. Oh I'm not actively trading it, just saving. If I had worried about the fee and instead saved in fiat over a month to deposit in coinbase then I'd have missed out on chunks of the bullrun and wouldn't have avoided a fee. So I'm very pleased with how my strategy played out so far.


True, but not a problem for me. I don't mind losing this as I have keys on cold storage. This is just my medium term savings strategy that I can liquidate instantly when I want. I'm exploring the idea of saving in crypto instead of a bank savings account. I think in the years to come, this is going to be an appealing strategy for those fed up low interest savings rates ~0.1% I'm exploring the convenience of that.


Basically there's a cost to turn revolut's custodian btc into private key BTC... something like ~5% which is fine if my balance gets too big that I want to offset the risk. It'll be a cost of insurance and look getting cash out an ATM has fee's or converting change at the supermarket has a fee.  At the end of the day I don't think fees should scare you out of BTC.

That's not an issue, Once I have like $1k on Revolut then I'll change it to fiat and send it to my coinbase account to put into my own wallet. Means I haven't missed out on this bull move.

For Europe I use Revolut a simple mobile banking app, you can send money to friends, buy crypto, deposit, withdraw.  My referral if you want a free debit card: 
I buy like 5 euros worth of a mix of crypto every day instead of my coffee, (BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, XRP) been doing that for a year and it's like awesome savings account.

Today is my son's birthday! I'm so happy

What fees? do you mean spread? 
I just save $5 a day, then once I get like $1k I turn the crypto into fiat and send it to coinbase for free then withdraw the bitcoin to my own wallet. Means I managed the catch the entire bullrun this year with a healthy daily savings activity.

true that

wasn't it just technical issues? where did the money go... can't trust a liar :[

The economics of bitcoin make me think it will always be the most valuable crypto. 
The new cryptos are a flash in the pan, their economics aren't as good and unless they can grow at a greater rate than BTC continually then they're not going to over take it. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 00:27:37
but you'd just hang up before 120 and keep the BTC
@_date: 2019-09-26 23:40:46
the other vendor's don't do what you and 12 others do.
@_date: 2019-09-26 17:37:57
no it doesn't, vendors's use payment processors like bitpay that dump the bitcoin on the market.

all fun and games until bills need to be settled in fiat.

if you brought the car with EUR that'll be capital gains too.

If you put $50 into it everytime it goes down then one day you'll be in the green
@_date: 2019-09-26 10:53:28
anything similar for the UK?

Don't worry bro it can go the other way too, I've been on the fence about house prices for over 5 years and still amazes me how they stay up so high, I saved in that time like a fool whilst many people got lots of easy money. The markets aren't rationale and neither are we.
