I agree. Although how do you judge PHP code?

Thank you for your opinion.
I do like the layout of Coinsfortech.com, though it's not a marketplace.
I did have a brief look at Cryptothrift.com, and I will outline the differences later.
Okay, so when we consider ebay's fee, it's relative to the overall price of the item that you are selling as you know. Let's have a look.
Insertion fees.
€0.01 - €1.49, No Fee.
€1.50, 16.6%.
€7.00, 5%.
€20.00, 3.5%.
€50.00, 2.8%.
€150.00, 1.3%.
Final value/sale fees.
"10.0% of the amount of the winning bid, up to a maximum FVF of €95.00."
That's the listing fees out of the way. Now let's consider the transaction costs. Anyone else use Paypal?
transaction fee.
"2.2% +30¢ (Merchant Rate)."
"2.9% +30¢ (Standard Rate)."
So if we take an average sale, say something from the middle, €20.00?
We'll say 3.5% insertion fee + 10% Final value/sale fee + 2.2% +30¢ (&gt; for non-merchants).
So where are we now 15.7%? Though my math is usually terrible.
We could also take Paypal's B.S. currency conversion rates into consideration, but I won't bore you further.
Bitcoin Trades will oversee the escrow, which as far as I know ebay or Paypal do not offer. They just use some form of specialized complaints department if someone screws up, from what I remember.
I may be the only person here who uses Paypal in conjunction with ebay. Why? Because ebay doesn't like Bitcoin very much. Proof: They shutdown my account:/
Anyway, enough about ebay and Paypal, they've monopolized the market for long enough..
I do take your point on Cryptothrift.com. When including their buyer and seller fees, their commission totals only 2.5%. That's half the price we offer. I will see about lowering our fees.
But lets face it, Bitcoin is an anonymous currency. If Cryptothrift.com is going to ask its buyers to register before making any purchases then they may as well accept visa for all intents and purposes. 
Bitcoin Trades does NOT require registration to make purchases, and buyers will still receive instant update notifications on their payments from the sites nav menu.
I want to make it pretty clear, I have NOT single single-handedly built Silk Road 3.0 in 2 weeks of coding. I do not take any credit for revolutionizing the way Bitcoin is used, as I take it some readers think I am implying, but I will pledge that  services will vastly improve over time. 
If any readers would like to join us, become partners, code for the site, etc. Just throw me a line, admin thanks for reading.

I see.

I understand. 0.4 BTC for the Blackberry and I will contact the seller about throwing in the head shaver. Do we have a deal?

Thanks, I have a feeling I'm going to need it.

Keep in mind this site is far from finished after two weeks of coding. It's the basic outline of a Bitcoin marketplace. 
The important thing is that we get some input on what extra features we need to implement before moving forward.
Feedback much appreciated.
