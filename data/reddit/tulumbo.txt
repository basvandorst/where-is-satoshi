He would be paying ~2% of his total stash to buy a trezor. That's a pretty hefty fee for security. Everybody has their own risk tolerance, but with a stash of only $5K I wouldn't buy a Trezor. 
However if the value went up, I would reconsider.

So in our current situation isn't demand defined as the number of people who want to buy bitcoin at the current price? This can change because of the sentiment of current owners, the sentiment of prospective owners, or  because of an increase in prospective owners or decrease in current owners. Demand has multiple dimensions.

This doesn't mean that current developments can't change the expected future landscape and therefore impact the price. Some good news is already priced in, but definitely not everything.
The current $600 price reflects the balance between the future possibilities of bitcoin's success and its failure. When the price changes I simply view this as the odds of success/failure shifting in the eyes of the speculators.

Then I would buy one when the price crosses that threshold instead of killing 10% of my investment now. And maybe by then a trezor will be cheaper.
Doesn't that make more sense...

These are two ways in which the price can increase:
1) Sentiment becomes more optimistic, and the population of bitcoin owners remains the same.
2) Sentiment remains the same, but the population of bitcoin owners increases.
You didn't take into account this second point. Sentiment doesn't necessarily need to change in order for the price to change.
@_date: 2014-10-18 15:58:44
Doesn't that depend on how much you're securing? I don't think I would pay more than 1% for security...so in this case I would need $10,200 of btc to warrant a Trezor.

I thought we were talking about the network effect, not the network itself. Just the fact that this guy has active ownership of a bitcoin address means there is one more person I can send my bitcoins to. That makes my bitcoins more valuable to me. But I agree the effect would be increased by him spending his coins.
@_date: 2014-03-21 00:52:09
I agree with your last point, but demand absolutely has a correlation with the number of people interested in purchasing at a given price. If there are a lot more people intersted in purchasing at the current price, chances are the sum of all the bitcoins these people want to buy at the current price is higher than a smaller amount of people. Get it now?
