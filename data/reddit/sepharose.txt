True, but most people aren't interested in setting these software apps up. They will be content to use Coinbase, or Apple pay, or Paypal, or some other payment service. This is where these companies will improve their margins. They will set up lightning channels and sell the services to their lazy clients.

Everyone will need to open at least one on chain transaction to open the lightning channel.

I didn't think coinomi was available for iOS. Isn't it a deterministic wallet?
@_date: 2018-01-01 07:28:50
How so? I do bitcoin transactions every now and then. Some of them are to coin exchanges, and I buy stuff occasionally. With lightning, I open a single channel with the exchange, and leave it open from now until the distant future. All the transactions that I'm currently doing on chain move to the lightning channel. So my 6-10 on chain transactions per month move to a single on chain lighting channel with 10 off chain lighting transactions.

Thanks, but I'm in it for curiosity more than a reward. I'm running that vanitygen command right now, but it could be weeks or longer before it finds anything. Or it may never find anything, who knows?  Besides, if I find it, then I would have the private key, so that kinda means you couldn't really trust it if I gave it to you.
@_date: 2019-07-19 00:55:40
That really sucks, sorry. Is malware possible? Did you verify the gpg signature for the electrum file when you downloaded it?
It sounds like you're maybe working with multiple wallets in electrum. I assume you've checked the ismine function in all of them? I'd still try to close everything and reconnect to a different server. That's done in the Tools-&gt;Network menu.

So this probably would have played out like this: Zach would withdraw the money from zelle, bought bitcoin and sent them to Steve, and then Steve would dispute the original zelle transfer as fraudulent. zelle would then reverse the transaction and take the money from Zach's bank account, and Steve doubles his money at Zach's expense.

Yes, I can post there. I should also clarify the above command will search for an address with exactly 30 characters (1 followed by 29 characters that are any combination of a-z, A-Z, or 0-9). The command to search for 30 characters or less is actually:
`./vanitygen -r "^1[a-zA-Z0-9]{0,29}$" -k`
It's a cpu only search, so it might take a LONG time to find anything.

Here's the vanitygen command for an address with 30 characters or less:

Thanks for following up. I wasn't sure of the answer but I couldn't think of any reason why a hash would take any longer for an uncompressed key versus a compressed key. I thought vanitygen maybe only generated uncompressed addresses. Good to know it does both.

You might need to put single quotes for the addresses:

 `ismine('bc1q8fs7m34qwwg74y35v5ugmv39ntegxr643lcj76')`

If you sell you will have income. They're taxed as capital gains, which has a different rate if you hold the coins over a year. (in the USA)
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:26:02
Right. It's just a measure of the current value of all the coins in existence. It's usually used for relative comparisons to other coins or businesses since the price of a single share or coin can be deceptive. For example, Amazon shares go for about $1150, and Microsoft shares go for about $83, but Microsoft is actually a more valuable company with a market cap above $600 billion while Amazon has a market cap of $550 billion. The same principles can be applied to coins.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:14:02
No, it doesn't. Deterministic wallets are created by hashing your seed words along with a nonce, i.e. SHA256(seed words + n). You'd have to be able to reverse the SHA256 to find the original seed. 
There is a caveat however, if your master public key and a single private key become known, all your keys could be compromised. So it is always advised to keep your private keys private.
@_date: 2019-07-25 20:35:11
I was trying to help another person import their private keys to electrum a while back. As soon as electrum received the coins, they were swept away to a similar bech32 address. It turns out he had shared his seed with a suspicious website in his attempt to obtain private keys. Any chance you shared your seed with a website or compromised computer?
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:30:34
Why do you say it's not true when that's exactly what Coinbase does? They buy and sell coins and profit from the spread.
@_date: 2019-07-18 23:31:29
Both those receiving addresses are bitcoin segwit addresses (bech32). Is there a chance that electrum did a sweep transaction rather than private key import? I think if you already had money in your electrum wallet than the chance of malware is pretty low. Try to confirm that  bc1qtmyjfhz93gh33raxcycagpy44avnqm568zjsha and bc1q8fs7m34qwwg74y35v5ugmv39ntegxr643lcj76 don't actually belong to your electrum wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:41:24
No, Coinbase only offers "market" buy and sell prices, so I might be able to buy at $15000, while I could only sell at $14900. They don't do limit orders like a typical exchange. When you use coinbase, you're buying or selling coins directly from coinbase. They profit by purchasing those coins on an exchange or from other coinbase users at lower prices than what they sell to you.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:52:35
I'd revise some of your discussion on mining. You state "51% of the miners need to agree on a block before adding it to the permanent ledger", however this isn't quite accurate. As soon as a miner discovers a valid block, it'll be broadcast to the network and nodes that receive the new block will verify it and update their blockchain. Miners aren't waiting for 51% consensus to add valid blocks.

@_date: 2017-12-07 00:25:52
It seems like a fairly typical transaction fee, especially considering the current rush of people getting into bitcoin. Some wallets will give you more flexibility over what you pay. Sunday nights the mempool seems to clear out, and I will get transactions through with only 7-20 sat/B. You paid about 10 times more than that. If you had imported the key rather than swept it, you wouldn't have paid a fee at all; your paper wallet and your exodus wallet would both show the balance.

Bitcoin core is very reliable, but it is a full node, so you need the full blockchain. If you don't want to wait, you can still use a lightweight wallet. You'll need to export the private key for the address you sent btc to, and then import that key into a different lightweight wallet, such as electrum.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:13:35
It sounds like you swept the private key rather than imported the key. A sweep involves a transaction that transfers btc to a new address. When you check your paper wallet balance, is it 0? Since the paper wallet had several inputs, the transaction cost more than average.

Someone else mentioned looking for seed words, which is another option to store bitcoin. If you see anything that's titled seed and followed by 12 or 24 seemingly random words, these can be used to recover coins. The seed words can access the coins even if the wallet is password protected and you don't have the password.

I am saying there is no evidence that Satoshi has ever spent his coins. A rational investor and entrepreneur who holds $1 billion plus in any single asset will diversify some portion of that asset into non-correlated holdings. There is 0 evidence that Satoshi has done this. We can thereby assume he is either not a rational investor or he no longer has the private keys to those coins. So if he's not a rational investor, what is he? His writings seem to indicate he was an academic interested in bitcoin from an experimental perspective. I never said anything about him being altruistic. To an academic and a scientist, his payoff is seeing his creation work as it was intended.

Why are you trying to stifle discussion by telling the OP to leave? He clearly made the point that bitcoin does indeed have the traffic to need additional lanes during times of market volatility \(the Dec. bull run\).
Even the prophet Satoshi described a plan to phase in block size increases.
" It can be phased in, like:
if \(blocknumber \&gt; 115000\)
    maxblocksize = largerlimit
It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete.
When we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade. "

What would Satoshi say?
"It's hard to imagine the Internet getting segmented airtight.  It would have to be a country deliberately and totally cutting itself off from the rest of the world.
Any node with access to both sides would automatically flow the block chain over, such as someone getting around the blockade with a dial-up modem or sat-phone.  It would only take one node to do it.  Anyone who wants to keep doing business would be motivated.
If the network is segmented and then recombines, any transactions in the shorter fork that were not also in the longer fork are released into the transaction pool again and are eligible to get into future blocks.  Their number of confirmations would start over.
If anyone took advantage of the segmentation to double-spend, such that there are different spends of the same money on each side, then the double-spends in the shorter fork lose out and go to 0/unconfirmed and stay that way.
It wouldn't be easy to take advantage of the segmentation to double-spend.  If it's impossible to communicate from one side to the other, how are you going to put a spend on each side?  If there is a way, then probably someone else is also using it to flow the block chain over.
You would usually know whether you're in the smaller segment.  For example, if your country cuts itself off from the rest of the world, the rest of the world is the larger segment.  If you're in the smaller segment, you should assume nothing is confirmed."

I don't think you understood my point. The article describes storage capacity as currently increasing at a decreasing rate; however several decades ago capacities were increasing at an increasing rate. This is a typical S curve, where technology will initially grow at super exponential rate, and eventually reach an inflection point where the rate of increase decreases. However the analysis assumes average block sizes will continue increasing at an increasing rate for 20 years. A better analysis would have treated average block size as an S curve in a similar manner as storage capacity was treated.

You could export the private key from your Core wallet for the address that you sent btc too and then import that key to a lightweight wallet such as electrum, mycelium or breadwallet. 
At the Core console you'd unencrypt your wallet  (if encrypted) using "walletpassphrase &lt;enter password&gt; 600" and then get the key using "dumpprivkey &lt;enter BTC Address&gt;"
Copy the 51 or so character private key and use a command similar to importprivkey for the lightweight wallet. You'll then have access to your BTC.

If you have any change in your wallet from the original unconfirmed transaction, you can spend that change to your own address with a high fee. Miners will see the spent change with a high fee, but they'll need to confirm the parent transaction in order to confirm the child transaction to get the high fee. (child pays for parent)

Adding your address changes the block hash, so different miners will find different hashes even when they are including the exact same transactions and nonce in the block. I think your idea of getting some percentage through a block is incorrect. There are an unlimited number of potential nonces to use, so you cannot say that you're ever some percentage into a block. In simplified terms, mining takes available transaction set from the mempool, adds a coinbase address to receive the reward, adds a timestamp and a nonce, and hashes that. If the hash result is a low enough number to match the current difficulty, the network will accept the block as valid and move on to the next block.
Mining pools can be thought of as a single entity since they all mine the using the same transaction set and reward address. So when a mining pool assigns work for individuals in the pool, they are assigned a range of nonces to test so as to not duplicate effort.
@_date: 2018-10-05 20:52:54
They put their own address into a block to receive the reward, so different miners will get different hashes, even when they use the same nonce and include the same transactions and timestamps. Realistically there will probably never be a collision.

Are you certain you have a valid private key? Is it encrypted? And regarding bitcoin-cli, have you tested this functionality? I'm not certain you need to download the blockchain to sign a raw transaction, but I could be wrong. You should just need to know your inputs (txid and vout) and then create your outputs. Once you have  a signed transaction hex you wouldn't even need to broadcast it through your own node, there are other nodes that have this functionality available.

I'm not too technically strong on coinbase transactions, but I believe there is a rule in the protocol that goes something like "The sum of all transaction outputs within the block must be smaller than or equal to the the sum of all transaction inputs plus the reward."
For some reason (error in a script?), this miner wrote an output of 49.99999999 in the coinbase when they could have written 50.01000000.

Yeah, I'm sure people have already looked at correlation between twitter/google searches and bitcoin prices. The great thing about research is that are always building on top of others work. Perhaps going down this sentiment path, where prior work just looks at bitcoin mentions, whereas you might find a way to separate the comments like "bitcoin is a scam" (negative sentiment) from other comments like "I use bitcoin to send money internationally" (positive sentiment). Perhaps including some measure of sentiment might paint a clearer picture of potential price movement?

Just look towards other industry; automotive industry moved towards consolidation, and now innovators such as Tesla, Coda, Think are entering the market place and growing because the conglomerates cannot innovate fast enough. You also fail to consider the rate of technological growth, as demonstrated by Nielsen's Law, and Moore's Law before that.

So if an airline chooses to fly a jet that is 10 floors high and holds 10,000 people, why should there be a regulation against it? Of course, they will have trouble finding an airport (node) where they can land, and most of the seats would be empty or filled with discount tickets (spam), so why would the airline choose to do this? This is the same idea as miners mining blocks that are a lot bigger than the industry average. Nodes won't relay them quick enough (or at all), and there aren't enough paying transactions to make it worth the risk.

It just sounds like you're saying bitcoin is some sort of magical unicorn that lives outside of market economics. Allowing bigger blocks will kill the nodes because businesses and enthusiasts will go broke buying $50 hard drives and internet connections. Miners will consolidate to a monopoly because every single person involved in bitcoin mining will choose to join the same pool and maximize their profit. The natural progression leads us to a network of 1 miner and 0 nodes.
I contend that bitcoin will not result in a monopoly, but will find equilibrium in a free market: low barriers to entry, regional power costs, constant innovation and progress of technology, existing monetary interests - these market factors will not allow a monopoly. The market for cryptocurrency is not a delicate flower that needs protection, and the 1mb limit is not what has made bitcoin the success it is. Maybe in the early days before this $15 billion+ industry it made sense, but economic forces are in control now. If bitcoin can't keep up with the market, it's network will shrink as that value moves to a chain that can.

bitcoin addresses have a checksum algorithm to protect from sending coins to mistypes addresses. I believe it is the last 4 bytes of the address, which act like a hash of the entire address. If the address is changed, and the checksum doesn't match the changed address hash, the bitcoin wallet should detect this and notify you. The wallet can't tell whether the address was generated offline or not, only that the checksum doesn't match the address.

How does this analogy make sense?  Miners are competing to discover blocks that maximize their profit.

If block size is left to the miners, the system would find an equilibrium just like any competitive market.

I think a better analogy would be letting airlines decide the size of the aircraft they choose to operate. Small aircraft can be profitable, but just barely. Mid-size aircraft are the sweet spot for profit due to their fuel efficiency and lower runway fees.

That's why the huge jets aren't really selling that well - Boeing has basically discontinues the 747.

I doubt you'd choose to die rather than pay taxes; but even if that's true for you, it is not true for 99.99% of other people. Clearly a government with enough power to wage war would have enough power to collect bitcoin from the taxpayers to pay for those wars.

To round out the rest of your portfolio you should also consider stock equities. A low cost diversified index fund is always good advice.

If you are familiar with a particular company that you feel will continue to grow, you can also consider an individual stock.

Reports on the death of Moore's Law are greatly exaggerated. Even if it is slowing down, most here lack the perspective to see just how fast technology grows. If Satoshi had been a decade early, he would have set block limits at 1 Kb, and in a decade from now, we will be downloading 1 Gb as if it were a text message.
I threw some numbers in a spreadsheet to illustrate, using Nielsen's Law  for bandwidth growth since it has been pointed out to be the bottleneck for for bitcoin. 
If Satoshi had doubled the block limit with every halving event, and assuming every block is maxed out, we're looking at the following scenario (starting bandwidth as arbitrary 1 and growing at Nielsen's Law 50% per year):
..YEAR /  blocksize / chainsize / bandwidth / chainsize to bandwidth ratio**
..2012 / 2  /           263 Gb  /  3.4      /       0.078.. 
..2016 / 4  /           788 Gb  /  17.1   /       0.046..
..2020 / 8  /           1.8 Tb   /  86.5    /      0.021..
..2024 / 16  /         3.9 Tb  /   438      /     0.009..
..2028 / 32  /         8.1 Tb  /   2217    /     0.0037..
..2032 / 64  /         17 Tb   /   11222   /     0.0015..
..2036 / 128  /       33 Tb   /   56815   /     0.00059..
..2040 / 256  /       67 Tb    /  287626  /    0.00023..
As you can see by the chainsize to bandwidth ratio, it is actually getting easier to download the blockchain, even with the block limit doubling with the reward halving. Looking out to 2040, the blockchain would be a maximum of 67 Tb, or roughly 1000 times bigger than right now, but our bandwidth will be more than 16000 times faster.

Consider using a wallet that will estimate the fee for you. Blocks are mostly full so you're competing for space. Check the mempool before a transaction to get a sense of the market. 50 satoshi per byte will get into a block at low mempool, but recent blocks have been filling up at 80-100 satoshi per byte.

To try to answer the second part of your question, I had to do a bit of reading (I'm not a cryptographer).
Once the wallet generates the 256 bit private key, it is used as an input to an elliptic curve algorithm (ECDSA)(which I'm not too familiar with), to generate a 512 bit public key pair. This public key is then hashed with sha256 and ripem160 for the 160 bit public key hash, which is encoded to base 58 with a checksum to form the public address.

1. United States and Western democracies fully adopt bitcoin as a reserve currency and settlement layer. China maintains ASIC manufacturing and mining operations dominance. A political dispute between the West and China prompts the Chinese government to annex private mining and ASIC manufacturing firms in order to directly control a majority of the global hash rate. China uses their hash rate majority to destabilize or threaten Western economies to come out ahead in their political dispute.
2. This attack won't occur tomorrow; bitcoin is currently too small and a 51% attack wouldn't significantly impact any economies. In the event that it could be used as a means of attack, opposing governments will naturally enter the business of mining bitcoin in the name of national defense. With multiple nations competing with each other, bitcoin remains decentralized and safe for global adoption.

A sequential deterministic wallet determines your private keys by hashing your your seed words along with an increasing sequence of numbers. So your wallet really just does this: 
hex(sha256('seedword1 seedword2 seedword3 ... seedword12 0'))
hex(sha256('seedword1 seedword2 seedword3 ... seedword12 1'))
hex(sha256('seedword1 seedword2 seedword3 ... seedword12 2'))

They're not encrypting information on the blockchain. A hashing algorithm is really just taking a large random sized piece of data, and converting that to a smaller fixed size piece of data. It's a one way process, so if the word "calculator" hashes to "5p3", you can't take "5p3" and run the hash in reverse to come up with "calculator". So miners build blocks by taking the hash value of the last block, add all the transactions they want to include in the block, add their address to credit the coinbase, add a timestamp, add a random number (called nonce), and then hash all those values to come up with a block hash, which might look like "0000000ab9fdc4cb28d2d32074b49d237ad07a7a047a891af4824a047a891af4824". However, depending on the current difficulty, if the hash value only has 8 leading 0's, the network won't accept it. Network is looking for a block hash with at least 18 leading 0's. So the miner changes the random number in their input, and rehashes again and again until they come up with a hash value with 18 leading 0's, which will be accepted by the network and credit their address with the block reward.

I think you're underestimating just how fast trends can change. I love bitcoin and have benefited from it more than I will admit online, but when I try to really be an impartial observer, I have to recognize that it's value is coming from the people using it. My point with AOL, Myspace, etc. is that people are fickle and switch their behaviors as soon as it's trendy to do so. I think a better analogy to TCP/IP would be blockchain mining protocol; both have networks built on top of them and are basically transparent to the users, and they're aren't really any competitors to those protocols. But the networks built on top of them are visible, and their success is dependent on the ever changing culture of the people using them.

1. Bitcoin doesn't generate revenue. Historically, revenue generating investments (stocks and real estate) have been the best investments when you have a long investment horizon.
2. The current price may be overvalued. Even for bitcoin, a doubling in price within a two month period, and a 10-fold increase in a year, is unusual and has typically been followed by a price decline. We experienced a price spike at the end of 2013 similar to the recent price movement; it took 4 years for those investors to make a gain. Many ended up selling due to media claims that bitcoin had died after Mt. Gox collapsed.
3. There is no barrier to entry for competing cryptocurrencies. A competing cryptocurrency could easily replace it.
4. Potential government regulation could easily influence the price and your ability to buy or sell bitcoin.
5. Improvements to block chain analysis tools may reduce the ability to use bitcoin anonymously, which reduces/eliminates one of the major use cases.

Really I think it is just ignorance behind this discourse. As financial leaders, they are expected to comment on emerging financial tools and trends. Yet when they say they are bullish on blockchain but bitcoin is a scam, etc., it really shows they don't understand what they're talking about. As far as I know, nobody has shown how to use blockchain without some tokenized asset that the network competitively mines. Without miners competing to add blocks and collect the block reward token, it's just a shared database. Shared databases have been around for a long time and are not innovative at all.

Of couse  is a valid point, and only fools disregard history. Bitcoin is new, but the markets have certainly experienced other new technological innovations, and people claiming "This time it's different!" have usually ended up losing their shirts.
If you're claiming my point  is invalid because bitcoin is a currency, I would counter that currencies are terrible investments. Who in their right mind would purchase dollars to hold in their wallet speculating they might be worth more tomorrow or next year?
If you're claiming bitcoin is a commodity, then again, commodities are not good investments. People can make money trading them, but not very much money is actually made from just buying and holding them. Gold is the perfect example; it's very valuable, but the purchasing power from 1 ounce of gold has not really changed much in hundreds of years. People use it to store wealth, not to build wealth like a good investment can do.
So bitcoin is something new; it's a hybrid digital currency-commodity, and an entirely new asset class. But my point is valid; it doesn't actually generate revenue. Those with a long view and some perspective need to recognize that history favors revenue generating assets over non-revenue generating assets. Bitcoin's gains are entirely dependent on a growing network effect, and that's very risky. Networks are composed of people who change their preferences about as often as they change their underwear.

1) Transfers will almost always require some fee to be included in a block. If you want to wait until times when the network is not busy, such as Sunday nights, you can usually pay lower fees for transactions. Consider keeping an eye on the mempool size (transactions waiting to be mined). When it's smaller than 1 or 2 mb even a very small fee transaction is likely to be mined in the next block.
2) Not sure about your breadwallet issue. Any wallets that you set up using the same deterministic phrase should have the same receiving addresses. You should confirm this.
3) You could invent your own 12 word phrase, but for breadwallet (and many other wallets) it would have to be using words from the BIP39 wordlist. 
Coming up with your own phrase is discouraged behavior because people are very bad at true random phrases.

Just back of envelope numbers, it looks like you've got about 800 inputs. If each input takes about 180 bytes in a transaction, you've got a transaction needing 144000 bytes of data. The going rate for a transaction is around 100 satoshi per byte (maybe more if you want fast confirmation), so your fees should be close to 14.48 million satoshi, or 0.144 btc.
You should probably break this up in several transactions since I believe there is a max size of 100000 bytes per transaction.

I'm finding the most time consuming transactions to parse are those with many inputs since it needs to lookup the address for each input. So some 1mb blocks with lots of small transactions can be parsed and written to the database in under 1 minute, while other 1mb blocks with many very large transactions can take close to 5 or 6 minutes.
Another piece of advice, although depending on your configuration it might not be a problem - You should consider coding in some sort of check to make sure an instance of the parsing script isn't already running when starting the script. I use the blocknotify functionality to trigger the script to start. A problem comes up when two blocks are found at close to the same time, where a second script was executed before the first block was fully parsed. This resulted in transaction duplication and inaccurate balances for the addresses in those blocks. I resolved it by putting a control table in my database to set a parameter to true if the script was running and to check that the parameter is false before starting a new parsing script.
@_date: 2019-04-24 20:24:55
Hi, I might have some answers. I've gone through a similar exercise and parsed out address balances using a script I wrote.
1. The block can't be changed once it's confirmed without changing the block hash, but it could be orphaned during a block re-org.
2. I think you should consider waiting several confirmations before parsing to your database to protect against orphaned blocks. This will be even more important if your code is used on alt coins with lower hash rate and higher network latency.
3. I am almost certain vout value cannot be negative, but I haven't seen any code that verifies this.
4. Try to minimize the number of rpc calls and database queries as best you can. My script is taking forever to parse bitcoin since I wasn't very cautious about minimizing the time consuming portions of parsing a blockchain. I would also consider how you handle raw multisig transactions. These aren't very common since pay-to-scripthash accounts for vast majority of multisig, but when they are used as outputs, there will be multiple addresses in the array. Any of these addresses could potentially spend the outputs, so it will be tough to decide which address is credited with the output balance. For an example, see vout 0 in txid  ea8771a70372457cf43df0fcd646e4a1daa8cb94d3a1d472710c618cd081b4cc

@_date: 2017-09-06 06:03:20
The private keyspace is 2^160. I think if you can see 7/8 of the private key (87.5%), this really only reduces the keyspace to 2^157 ((2^160 - (2^160 x 7/8)). So if you're searching ~ three trillion hashes per second (2^35), it will still take you 2^122 seconds to search the keyspace, with 50% probability of finding the key at 2^121 seconds. A year is around 2^25 seconds, so you will need 2^96 years (to reach 50% probability of finding the key after seeing 87.5% of the private key. For reference, the age of the universe is only 2^34 years.

It's the ~64 character random number that you use to sign a bitcoin transaction to move bitcoin from one address to another. Any wallet that you use on your desktop or phone will most likely let you control your own private keys, whereas online wallets such as coinbase usually won't let you control your own private keys. So online wallets don't tend to be private, since you need to supply a name, but desktop wallets can be used privately since no name is needed to use them.

How am I wrong? You're telling me that a merchant wallet can't see whether a transaction was signed with a valid key? You're telling me that a merchant can't see whether confirmed or unconfirmed inputs are being used in a transaction? You're telling me that a merchant can't check several nodes to see whether a transaction has propagated through the network? You're telling me that a merchant can't view the transaction fee associated with a transaction? So if merchant's have no view to any of this, how the hell can miners see it?!

You'll be able to query blocks and transactions by just linking your website through the node by rpc. If you want to search addresses, you'll need to maintain a your own database with address data that is separate from the blockchain files your node maintains. It's actually a very good exercise to learn about coding and blockchains. I've done it and I'm not a developer or programmer.

You won't need to use bitcoin core and download the entire blockchain to access your coins. You can sweep your private key to a lightweight client like electrum and get access to your coins in minutes.

@_date: 2017-09-06 07:14:48
Hmmm... I'm no expert either. If you're right, than the full key could be found in fractions of a second with 7/8 knowledge. If we look at smaller numbers, say keyspace is 2^8 , 2^8 - 8 * 7/8 = 2^1. So by your formula, seeing 7/8 of a key with keyspace of only 256 bits leaves only 2 unknown bits of information about the key? Or if we look at the numbers without exponents, seeing 7/8 of the key reduces the keyspace from 1.46E48 to 1.04E6, which is a reduction by a factor of 1.39E42?

Yes, I think there is a chance that you could get your bitcoin back in this scenario, but you'd need to successfully double spend your coins using replace-by-fee. You'd also have to be able to anticipate a merchant receiving your transaction in a block that ended up being orphaned, which would be very difficult to do unless you controlled a big portion of the hash power.

Hi, I may be able to answer this question if Pieter Wuille doesn't get back to you.
The risk with paper wallets in this scenario is that a user may import the  private key to their wallet software to spend a UTXO. Afterwards, the user may delete the wallet software mistakenly thinking that the change is still at the paper wallet address. The reality is that the software will almost always send change back to a different address, and by deleting the software wallet they are deleting the private keys to their new change address.

I remember following a stock picking website several years ago that had a neural network trained to spot profitable swing trades based purely on market data. The neural network would essentially spot a pattern in stock A that had historically preceded a price change in stock B. The website showed results with about 55&amp; accuracy, which doesn't sound great, but after many trades it is actually very profitable to be 55&amp; accurate. The guy ended up retiring and closing the website, so I think he was on to something. Anyway, I think bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are good candidates for this type of neural network since they are completely sentiment driven without any earnings to cloud movement in market price.

You're missing the point. The ETF provider would purchase all those BTC with only a handful of on-chain transactions as opposed to 100,000 people purchasing a single BTC using an on-chain transaction. The ETF shares would then be distributed to hundreds of thousands of people off-chain while the actual BTC remain in the ETF cold storage. Traders would be able to continue to trade ETF shares off-chain forever, or until they redeem the actual BTC for their ETF shares.

I assume the satoshi spent on the fake P2SH addresses are permanently lost. Have you done any analysis on the feasibility of using entirely op\_return through multiple transactions? I would think your first op\_return meta\-data output could point to other transactions that contain op\_return outputs?

Use two wallets; a legacy bitcoin wallet and the forked bitcoin wallet. Duplicate the wallet.dat file (or export/import keys) with transactions prior to the fork and use in both wallets.
With that said, I think the chance of a fork are exaggerated.  Unless it is a very contentious fork, where close to 50% of the hash power ends up on each side, the bitcoin difficulty adjustment time will make it hard for anyone to mine the minority chain. Block times will skyrocket, and by definition, the minority chain will have lower prices, so mining on this probably won't be profitable and it will quickly die.

There's no need to do anything now. The most likely scenario will be an uncontentious fork, where the minority chain quickly dies before enough blocks are mined for the difficulty to adjust. If a minority fork manages to survive, you'll be able to import the same private keys to two separate wallets; main chaing and minority chain wallets. Both will have the same transaction history up to the block where the fork occurred.
