Then the price needs to stop jumping by another thousand every 5 hours

Maybe, but at this moment, I don't think so. Everything is on a general upswing. The market is pretty healthy at this point in time. Everything has been in the green on average lately.

Yes, I was one of those people saying those things. And I'm not trying to promote altcoins here so I won't mention any names, but I was investing in certain alts when Bitcoin was near $1k, and Bitcoin's growth was beaten by those coins over the last year. People are getting tied up with the magnitude of these numbers and forgetting it's all about the percentages.
At the end of the day, you are investing because you want to increase your wealth. Tribalism when it comes to coin loyalty is a bit silly; cryptocurrencies will eventually take over the market, so there's no need to be loyal to any one of them.

Newbie, probs.

As someone who doesn't hold BTC but holds a bunch of other coins, I see no reason why you should jump onto this boat now. A jump from 15k to 50k is about 333% gains. You would have a better time betting on a smaller (and more viable) coin jumping from $1 to $3.3 and make the same money.

Is it forbidden to talk about other coins here? Because there's Litecoin exactly for this kind of thing.

If a solar flare knocked all communications out, I see no reason why crypto would retain its market value.

That's a limited interpretation of economics, imo. Selling isn't the only thing that can drive a price down. A solar flare would create psychological impact on our trust in technology. This "magic internet money" bullshit would become a bigger thing. And no one knows how temporary the communication loss would be.

He's messing with you.

Just makes sense. Bitcoin has faults that we don't need to repeat; newer coins make up for those faults. And no coin has ever hit 50k, while many coins have gone from $1 to $10 and more. It's just a safer investment, imo. You are asking Bitcoin to keep breaking new ceilings to make the same amount of money you'd make by just asking a small coin to do what many others have already done.

You can buy your cryptocurrency without quitting your studies.
