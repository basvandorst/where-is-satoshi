Ive always wondered how people can be sure they aren't buying these things from undercover cops or whatnot. They have to ship the product somewhere, and even with PO boxes, the cops would be able to get your name/address. 
Unless you make the PO box with a fake ID...but then they could just stake it out waiting for you to pick up your item. Doesn't seem very anonymous.

Yeah I really have no idea. I stopped dealing with them after their insane password leak.

why wouldn't this thief just load up the wallets you tell him in bitcoin, check their balance and send the coins to his own wallet? this isn't cash that you have to lug around...
Or even, "send all your bitcoins to X address or i will kill you" then it wouldn't really matter how many encrypted wallets you have. 
Only way to combat this is to have a couple fake wallets with a low balance in them and keep the rest encrypted in a truecrypt container hidden away somewhere.

So how would you properly order something from this place? (for science of course)

I love how i got downvoted for asking a question.

Vegeta sounds like an ignorant teenager who has dollar bills in his eyes and an idea - no plans or anything on how to even implement it, ignorant of the laws and other processes that involve starting a legit business. 
Jessy has so much experience and she just gave him some insane tips - his reply "I didn't understand half the stuff you said" Tells you a lot about his business skills. Jesus christ.
 Ah well, thats why they say 9/10 startups fail.
*edit, read more of the thread, holy fuck, she offered so much good free info - the kind some companies pay hundreds of dollars an hour to consultants for and he dismisses her and calls her names..absolutely insane.

If theoretically speaking 50% of miners stopped, would the difficulty go back down?
@_date: 2011-06-16 21:38:01
Wow that is pretty smart.

on-screen keyboard embedded in the client as the only way to enter pwd would solve keyloggers.

Out of everything, that should have been 
What good are your block downloads or interface changes or dns fixes when all of your money could be stolen by a virus.

This is why I upgrade my hardware after converting bitcoins into dollars, that way if bitcoin fails, i have a kickass insane awesome computer FREE that will last me for the next couple of years

Oh so you were mining since way back when? Dang

Yeah I'm never using mtgox again, after a fuckup of such high calibre its tradehill and others for me.

The more you think about, the more this looks super fishy, all you need is even a super old wallet file and you are safe forever, no way in hell they only had 1 copy of their wallet file. 
@_date: 2011-06-17 14:35:24
Ohh yeah didn't think of that. 
@_date: 2011-06-17 13:16:28
Or even better, after you enter your password, it would send a link you have to click in your email to authorize the payment. And this email address would be locked to the wallet.dat so you cannot change it.
Or even even better, have an on-screen keyboard where you'd enter your first password.
And wallet.dat would be encrypted with this password, so even if you move the wallet.dat, you'd still need to enter this password PLUS click the link in your email to send payments.

Lets hope they will!

I thought it maybe did something so other backups wouldn't work anymore, this way if someone already stole your wallet right now and has a copy, they'd be able to steal your money later - so your encryption would be useless.

I used them, works well, you can deposit money and withdraw straight with interac email transfer and bank-&gt;bank transfers.
@_date: 2011-07-13 13:52:10
What happens to the unencrypted backups though? Lets say i encrypt one of my wallets and then something happens and it is now corrupted, can I restore the unencrypted backup into the new bitcoin client?
@_date: 2011-07-31 13:49:08
And also offsite backups.

its about 8$ that you'd be able to make every day, 240 in a month.. you can upgrade video cards with that money which is what im doing.

5000's are much better/cheaper for this, i picked up a 5870 on craigslist for $200 and its going at 370 mhash/s
@_date: 2011-06-18 13:28:46
What why, you can make .6 btc a day with that.
