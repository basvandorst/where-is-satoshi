Can I ask where you're from? I've been looking for other bitcoiners and and exchange sounds very interesting.

I wonder if some bad people are already using botnets. A million nodes with just CPU miners could give you &gt;1000GH/s.

If you would have kept the 1000 BTC, would you really be worth 14k USD now? Would you sell it now?

I'm not completely sure, but I think it is a graph of the USD/BTC price on MtGox, but tilted to the right. Price is labeled on the x-axis and time isn't labeled and goes from up to down. Mouseover to view the actual time.

Bah, my money transfer to MtGox still didn't come through. I'm not buying at this price out of spite.

I like how well it shows human fascination with round numbers. You can clearly see the steps at integers.

Damn. Why can females whore out their body and males can't? I doubt a lot of people are interested in words written on my (male) chest.

That's interesting, I've looked into that option too. How big are you setting it up? Have you made any agreements with your bank?

Why does Google keep on surprising me with awesomeness?

Let's hope 1PZjfkLZBT7Q3UFmyEWH8QtuzTMi3MUiBj never lost his wallet.

Yes, that's the whole point of markets. Some people make a living doing just that.

Please tell me the computation isn't done in PHP. That would most certainly be wasting cycles.
I can't help you with your exact problem, but have you tried looking at the [other miners' code](
@_date: 2011-06-08 19:05:30
It's not a stupid question.
I could keep looking at it. As I've understood, the green line is the actual price, with the y-axis as the time.

Which would mean that the bitcoin won't be paired with the dollars, which was the point your parent is trying to make.

Is "the order sheet" based on actual orders? Surely there are no orders waiting at 30 $/BTC?
I understand the momentum explanation, but I'd like to know how they're calculated.
