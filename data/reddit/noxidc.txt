Sorry mate. I know you're optimistic that bitcoin will be accepted in more places. unfortunatly the plain reality is that bitcoin is broken. It is not a means of exchanging wealth anymore. When demand gets high, bitcoin breaks. Just this week there were 200k stuck transactions in the mempool and fees to move bitcoin are just stupid high for any meaningful purchase. imagine buying a $80 game and paying $15 in fees. There is a reason steam just dropped it as a payment method.

look im not saying the price wont rise. shit it could be a million dollars by 2019. but when it is no longer able to be used as a means for transferring goods and services for value it then becomes a speculative bubble. Doesn't mean i wont ride it all the way up and down, its just what it is now.

Zimbabwe destroyed their countries productive capacity buy killing farmers and manufacturers and at the same time getting international sanctions on them. So unless that is going to happen in the U.S. or there is a civil war again, it will be the last country to run out of money.
