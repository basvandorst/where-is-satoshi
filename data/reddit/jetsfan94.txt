Which websites or apps do you recommend that allow you to keep bit coins safely without then getting stolen ? 
@_date: 2016-09-25 04:00:36
Honestly, I just assumed they would. As you see my knowledge of this is poquito.

Why is local bitcoin so widely used ? I guess there no other way to get bitcoin lower prices other then knowing a miner yourself.
