Exactly, anyone can “audit” it themselves.
Hopefully people are just unaware that this info is available and aren’t actually asking for the fed to be politicized.

All of the info is public, do your own audit.
All that is left, and all that you can be asking for when you say ‘complete audit’ in context of congress, is a politization of monetary policy.
As seen in every instance of this through history it’s a terrible idea.
That’s my take, hopefully it can explain the logic of those that shoot down your complete audit idea.

Hi all, new to crypto-currency. I've been cognizant of bitcoin for sometime but it didn't seem approachable. Dogecoin has made me a participant.
It sort of seems like bitcoin is for druggies and hackers while dogecoin is fun internet money.
I understand that i've wholly mis-categorized bitcoin, but I'm just honestly articulating my (mis)conceptions.
Downvotes to the left, but that's how I see it and I think that sentiment is what is driving the massive dogecoin growth.
Why not dogecoin?

Right, I agree sort of. But there will be fiat &lt;--&gt; doge exchanges so that advantage won't exist for long.
No one will be clamoring for physical coins, that is just silly.

In your scenario, if dogecoin is what is bringing in new people why would bitcoin be relevant once there is a USD -&gt; Doge exchange?
(honest question)
