 is awesome. They are pro-free speech/privacy activists based in malaysia. And are very pro bitcoin. They actually host their own p2pool node in Singapore. Their subscription gives you access to all of their vpn servers worldwide, so you can pick which country you want to use depending on the specific situation.
 offers a decent vpn that is really easy to setup on android. Just install the app and you are good to go. Doesn't protect your privacy as well as Boleh.
edit: Also the Boleh subscription allows you to use 2 devices through their vpn at any given time. They also have android capability but it isn't as polished as disconnect.me
edit 2: I don't think disconnect.me accepts bitcoin. You really should just go with Boleh. They are awesome.
edit 3: disconnect.me offers 256mb free every month, really useful to those of you who are cash strapped. I still think its worth it to buy a sub to Boleh though.

Just use  and have it output with a time delay and to two different addresses. That way people can't track amounts through the blockchain. Make sure to use Tor, preferably through [Tails OS]( or a good [VPN]( to access Bitmixer. They have a great service.
Mixing is necessary to maintain financial privacy with Bitcoin.

Nope. If the feds asked them for user info they would be legally required not to tell us. Its called a gag order and it was what they served Lavabit.com. The owner of lavabit chose to shutdown his site instead of complying. That is the only reason we even know about this policy.
