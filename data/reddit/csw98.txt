I agree, no-one should work that much. It is not really the main point of the post, please see [my reply above](

The thing is moolah has claimed to have ATMs boxed and ready to ship back in March, near to the original shipping deadline. Whan people challenged him back then he called them trolls. 
Nothing shipped in March, when pressed he started putting blame on bill receptor drivers. As it did not give that much time he eventually said that he needed to change the whole architecture from built around raspberry PI to Intel. Huge change if you ask me. Then claimed that all was working fine and only the case was problematic to manufacture.
 from moolah.io blog prior to March shipping deadline
* The first prototype unit works amazingly, and we’ll be putting up videos as soon as we finalize an enclosure for it [(Jan 26 2014)](
* Our enclosure is en route, you’ll be seeing a video in the very near future and we’ll be shipping the first couple of units! [(Feb 5 2014)](/
* ATM Units, They’re ready to go. Big blog post coming shortly. [(Mar 6 2014)](
* On the physical product side of things, the first of our ATM units are ready to ship. **There’s a couple boxed up** and they’ll be going out to a few lucky people. We’ll be continuing to ship these on a regular basis. 
[(Mar 17 2014)](
[Here is a more complete post]( if you have some spare time (long) and posts challenging him from [January]( and [March]( 
[Quotes of moolah_ comments from Jan 18^th 2014](


* *A member of the team (probably me) will appear in the next promo video* 
* *We'll send a working ATM to the people who have ordered them, and demonstrate it working well in advance of that.*
*  *I will have a prototype sent to one of the founders funded by myself personally*
* *Our way of building trust was simply going to be to continue running a reliable platform, and ship our physical products when we say we will.*
* *In order to further build trust, we will be open sourcing the software portion of the devices ahead of schedule (within a week) for people to analyze.*
[Quotes of moolah_ comments from March 2014](


*  but this will be my only response to the thread - and the only result will be a technical demo of the ATM unit.
* People will either have a base unit shipped to them by the deadline, or they can wait on an extended prototype unit.
Sadly not a single of his promises were fulfilled, it is not about giving moolah extra 3 days, it is about keeping him in check. He hopes that people have gold fish memory and will forget about the promises he had made in the past, and it seemed to work great so far especially in Do you now what he posted after the first shipping deadline? [These amazing photos]( The unit was according to him just missing the case and fully working then.
 It is a long story

It might be some automod settings. There must  be many similar in place left from "old good times" of lleti and spork.

I believe "Mintpal justice" is legit. I  am just surprised by the messenger here. Why is it lleti posting it? He either wants to discredit the cause or is trying to rebuild his own credibility on someone's else work washing off his hands of any moolah involvement along the way.

Strange, but it looks like your very same comment on r/dogecoin was deleted by mod. It is still present in your history but not in the actual post. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 17:48:42
Why is it you posting it? You are lleti aren't you?
Lleti, the same guy who was working for moolah and moderating r/dogecoin deleting any posts questioning moolah and also banning users for bringing up issues of your  possible conflict of interests.
