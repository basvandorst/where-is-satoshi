I got about .07 BTC from CEX by selling old junk from the house. Waited a couple months for it to increase then I used that money to buy an expensive monitor from Scan (£800) and had a lot left over I took as cash.
It is a shame CEX no longer deal in BTC

Spent £3,000 on Steam games. Still disappointed.

It's a mad retarded meme. I'd search for other bitcoin subs to.
is a good place to start. Plus no memes.
Edit: well this is 2017 so there are definitely memes there. But not as much as here

Yeah I had to wait for the manager to get off his lunch for them to do it. I guess it goes to show a low demand for it and probably one of the reasons why they removed BTC from their offerings

It's not though. Granted the G in gif is a hard G as it stands for Graphic/Graphical. But the man who invented the format says it is pronounced Jif.

Yeah I saw the blip and bought as much as I could reasonably afford.
Here’s to it going back up!

2017; pays for haircuts with cheques.. this is so weird to me. Cheques are basically dead in England as a payment method for services in stores. It's like 98% debit and credit card transactions in this country with the rest cash.
The only time I dealt with cheques was in a professional capacity as a Corporate bank manager. And that was normally investigating why a cheque that my customer's paid in had bounced.
