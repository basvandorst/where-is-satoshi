If I'm correct...there r no rules
Which is why it's possible to bribe a miner via transaction fee

Perfect. I have to learn not to jump to conclusions. But with bitcoin,  time is of the essence if you need to try and replace a transaction. I overloaded my brain box with to much info to quickly and as a result was unable to fully understand WTF i was doin. Valuable lesson learned at the cost of a little stress....is all good. And thanks to all who gave input!!!! Much appreciated

Pretty sure its my brain that was hacked...haha. but...im coming to realize that with the right resources...it wouldn't b that difficult to take almost everybody's bitcoins
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:46:32
Well said.
Almost leaves no point left to argue...

Wallet gave message of 0 BTC when i attempted a PPFC transaction. Auto fee bullshit had a transaction with 0 confirms for like 3.5 hours. Attempted to transfer with a $15 transaction fee and told me i had zero. Attempting now to sweep wallet

See now "coffee day fair"  I might actually like coffee if such a day existed..lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:43:32
I totally get it. How many BTC user's complain of high fees??? LOTS!!! Why do these high fees exist....because miners can b bribed to confirm a transaction....Palin and simple
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:07:48
Check all my transactions and tell me if u see anything fucked up....
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:39:55
A change from the norm. To much politics involved in life. F! $k repubs and dems....should b based off right and wrong NOT off of politics
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:48:03
Then the one naughty miner would b caught by rest. Absolutely not about trust....which is why my fee shouldn't give me trust in a miner to complete my transaction 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:18:09
I'ma little communistic I spose....but the RICH monopolizing everything is a problem we all should take notice of. They're takin over btc by "bribin" miners with excessively high fees which as a result...prevents average daily users access to the btc blockchain. Miners are probably blinded by the light $$$$ but...when the average DAILY user is replaced...whose left????
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:38:14
Very true...
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:39:13
Trump actually....but if Bernie woulda had a chance..Ida helped him out
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:55:50
The transaction seems to b two transactions combined into one......
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:00:35
Imagine those baristas as miners...Everybody is waving their tip in the air (as with tx fees) wile the "baristas" pick and choose whose order to fill 1st. The rich Bernie Madoff MF's are wavin 100's in the air....whose getn coffee????
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:59:09
Whats even worse...is when you check the blockchain, that transaction has like 20 different addresses spending from it
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:46:26
Ima good tipper (even though I make 22,000 wit 3 kids) so my day wouldprobly end with severe dry mouth...due to the fact my $10 tip for a $4 coffee wasent enough....lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:47:12
See...my point exactly. It's only a matter of time bfore btc becomes just like everything else....currupt
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:37:33
They will regulate by conspiring with other  in attempt to lock up the BTC market by purchasing mass quantity of coins and locking them up the same way they do gold
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:41:34
Solved on own.

Wallet Dave's his name and probly wont help u. I asked his help to crack a wallet with 0.301 btc and he no-go'd me. But every situation is differ so never hurts ta ask. Kali Linux offers basically every tool needed to attempt a brute force attack on your wallet. You need to create a file that has everysingle password u could have used inside it. Theres multiple programs that will use that file+others in an attempt to open/unencrypt the file you need. Dont pay 50%  of whats in it to do something you could learn yourself in a week or less

This plunge is a direct result of the way Miners handle tx. Few months ago you had to pay a $20 tx fee everytime you moved funds thanks to the ever so  money hungry Miners. But no worries...aslong as u had that $20 tx fee the "currupt" Miners would confirm that shit in no time. Wile regular Joe Shmo looks at an unconfirmed tx for the next week. BTC was lovely...till that shit happened. Now everybody goin BCH and Monero....thanks Miners
