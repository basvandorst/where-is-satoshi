Why's that? Couldn't a unspent output also be artificial created to contain the bytestring of a virus signature?

Depends if it's represented as COutPoint, then it's just a tuple consisting of a transactions hash and the index into the transactions vout. If it's represented as CTxOut then it contains scriptPubKey and could contain arbitrary data (of a maximum length). Not sure what's actually store in the chainstate folder.

That does not mean that there are 460 people working all the time on the software. The actual number of full time bitcoin core developers is likely much lower.


That appears to include the assumption that more people having write access to the bitcoin repo would simply improve the situation. I think it would actually make project coordination harder and thus, make the overall situation worse.


I doubt that too. But your millage may vary.


That one is actually true, but due to historic reasons. I know that there is work underway to modularize bitcoin core, but it's not a simple task and requires time.

Didn't they just create a new currency instead of changing an existing one?  What prevents pre-fork ETH owners from using the classic chain?

Ok I see how one may describes this as reply attack. Can't that simply prevented by sending your coins to another (newly generated) address you own in the one chain and to the intended recipient in the other?

I'm sorry, but I fail to see an issue here. How is that a replay attack? A transaction is either valid in none, one, or more chains. What's wrong with sending a transaction valid in one chain, to the other?

Won't help you there. Puting hard-coded block hashes into the software only helps the software to determine what the main block chain is. You still have to download the whole block chain.
But if the checkpoint consists of the block hash and all unspent previous outputs, then it would work. You still had to download the outputs. But they are likely magnitudes smaller than the whole block chain. :)

How did you create the printout?

Misinformed may be an understatement.

And again, someone is calling bitcoin falsely ["a fully anonymous form of currency"]( Good that at least [bitcoin.org]( get's it right.

Is this any different from [bitmit.net](
