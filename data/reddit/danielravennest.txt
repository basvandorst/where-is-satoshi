Bloomberg L.P mentions they have a stake in A-H when they do a story about them, because it's a direct investment.  They don't mention indirect investments because it could get complicated.  For example, if Bloomberg L.P. parks some assets in an S&amp;P 500 index fund, they would indirectly own shares of almost every major company.
Note that Bloomberg L.P. is privately held, so they don't publish regular reports like publicly traded companies have to.

No, it is a weak increase in capacity by moving signature data out of the main block into a segregated file (hence "segregated witness").  How much increase you get depends on how many tools and nodes adopt the change, which will be zero at first.  At best it provides ~4x increase in transaction count, but more likely around 2x.
Average block size doubled in the past ~15 months, and incorporating this feature across all wallets, nodes, etc. will take roughly the same amount of time.  So it is likely just a holding action, with blocks continuing to be [80% or more full on average](
"We" implies everyone has the same opinion, which we don't.  I prefer raising the hard cap, which this does not do.  Obviously the core developers think this route is a better plan.

Actually, they would not in most cases.  Let's say each member of the consortium deposits an amount of cash based on bank size to a pooled central bank account.  When a user at Deutsche Bank wants to pay a user at UBS, the blockchain now indicates UBS owns a bigger share of the pooled account.  UBS can immediately credit their user, because they know they have a secure interest in the pooled assets to cover it.
Since transactions in large numbers will tend to average out, the participating banks will only have to add or withdraw from the pooled account once in a while.  Most of the time they are just changing ownership shares in the account according to the blockchain ledger.

I'm working on self-bootrapping automated production right now. I don't expect it to take 100+ years.
Replicators have to copy 100% of their own parts exactly.  This is both very hard, and limiting.  A starter set (seed factory) of machines can make parts for new machines not in the starter set, but they can't make 100% at first.  You supply the missing items from outside.  As the collection of machines grows, you can make more and more of the parts yourself, until you reach some practical limit.  Seed factories can also make different sizes than the ones they start with, so a small starter set can grow to a large industrial capacity.  
The starter set is on the order of 8 items, and in a small version can fit in a home workshop.

Your analysis is good as far as it goes, but you neglect the block reward halving in 2.5 months.  Imagine what would happen if the world supply of oil or gold was suddenly cut in half.  Demand for bitcoin is slightly more than supply, because the price is rising.  Now cut supply in half.  What will happen to the price?

I know you guys like to throw around the meme that the Dollar isn't backed by anything, but this is factually incorrect.  US dollars are backed by debt.  Circulating paper money is backed by Treasury Bonds and Mortgage Backed Securities held by the Federal Reserve.  Bank deposits are backed by bank loans made with those deposits.
It just happens that a debit card or paper cash is more convenient for most purchases than a mortgage or a T-bond, but in theory you could use the assets backing the dollars directly.
The debt, in turn, is backed by the taxing power of the US government, and the assets and labor promised against private loans.

It would depend on if there are assets to pay back the losses, and if the SEC can identify who lost money.
In my case, it was a publicly traded bond fund, whose manager committed multiple frauds related to mortgage-backed securities.  The fund manager (Morgan-Keegan) was owned at the time by Regions Bank, so the bank had to pay $265 million in total penalties.  As a publicly traded fund, there were pretty good records as to who owned the shares at the time.

The fact that price took off in early January, a month *after* the halving date points to them being related.  Miners who needed to sell coins to pay their electric bill tended to do that monthly.  Since they were producing fewer coins, that would show up about a month later as lower supply.  If demand was constant, which the price being near $10 the previous six months indicates, then we would expect the price to go up to a new equilibrium.

Who make it up by charging higher fees to merchants and higher interest to customers.  The merchants in turn pass it on to customers in higher prices.  Credit card companies are not charities.  Any business losses (stolen cards, fraud, customer failure to pay) have to be passed on to their customers.


Well, I couldn't do that when I ran a virtual world business.  Cashing out from in-world game currencies via paypal took an average of 10 days total.  A virtual world that used bitcoin as the internal currency could shave 10 days less 1 hour (for BTC confirmations) off my cash flow.
One more point - a service can be useful to a lot of people without being useful to everyone.  You may not personally need to do wire transfers or remittances, but a heck of a lot of people do.

You don't need a new Fab to produce a different integrated circuit, you need it to go to a different process node (size of features on the chip).  To make a different chip, you just need a new set of masks for the photolithography, and maybe new packaging for the pinouts.

Agreed.  The formula is:
* Real rate of return = nominal rate of return - inflation.
If inflation is negative (deflation), it just changes the nominal rate you need to charge to get the desired real rate.  Desired real rates are set by peoples time preference and risk tolerance.  Those don't change much with inflation rates.  
Time preference is things like "what am I willing to give up now to save for retirement?".  Generally people want a positive real return, because they value money now more than money in the future.

Data from the Silk Road indictment shows it accounted for 4% of bitcoin transactions during the time it operated.  So 24x as much is a reasonable estimate.
Bitcoin estimated transaction volume has been running at $18 billion/year the past year.  By their nature, darknet market statistics are hard to come by.  The Silk Road was an exception, since the government seized his computers and got a complete record.

There is a legal doctrine called "fruit of the poisoned tree".  Any evidence or testimony that is the result (fruit) of an illegal act is not admissable.  The question is whether the two DEA agents' thefts were related to later evidence or testimony.
Beyond that, the direct testimony of the agents is now questionable.  Did they lie on the stand to hide their own thefts?  Did they do anything to cover up or shift blame off themselves?  Honest government agents are presumed to be telling the truth, but admitted thieves don't have such a presumption.
I'm an engineer, not a lawyer, but in my layman's opinion, the very least that is due is a re-examination of the evidence and testimony in light of the agent's corrupt acts.  That could lead to a retrial or appeal.

[Timestamps in the block chain itself]( between the last block in a 2016 block interval, and the last block of the previous 2016 block interval.  The difficulty is adjusted up or down according to how much the time interval is above or below the desired 20,160 minutes.
One way to think of the block chain is a "distributed timestamp server".  Finding a block hash puts a definite time stamp on the transactions in the block.  Since blocks also include the hash of the previous block as part of their data, the blocks can be put in sequential order.  Thus the overall transaction history is in order, so you can tell if a given address output has been spent.

Force of law driving out the competition to government money.
In the U.S., the National Bank Act of 1865 imposed a 10% tax on the issuance of private bank notes, effectively forcing banks to give them up, and use the [greenbacks]( printed by the government.  Those were mostly unbacked notes issued during the Civil War (1861-5) to pay troops and expenses.  Because they were unbacked, they traded at a discount to gold.  In 1879 they became redeemable again, and traded at par.  In 1933 private ownership of gold was banned, and they could only be redeemed for silver.  In 1968 redemption was stopped and silver removed from new coins at about the same time, making U.S. money the fiat currency we have today.  It's value against gold and silver has declined sharply ever since.

I'm working on self-expanding automation - machines that make more machines.  Eventually end-point machines make products people need - for food, shelter, etc.
There is no reason to think automation will be limited to big companies any more than computers are, since a robot is just a computer with sensors and motors, and the right software.  All the parts are affordable.
A distributed community having one or a few core machines per person or small group (keeping it affordable) can start making parts for each other for more machines, until there are enough to produce robot farm tractors and sawmills, that in turn grow food and make building materials.  That way people's basic needs are met.
Bitcoin can be an automated settlement layer between machines and groups of people, so you can easily trade the outputs of your machines for other people's outputs, but you can just as well trade ownership shares in a machine collective, or other assets instead.

The 12 district Federal Reserve Banks are part of the national Federal Reserve System, they are not independent, more like branches of a conventional bank.
The reason there are 12 are they also operate check clearing between member banks and each other.  In the days of mostly paper checks, they needed to be physically close enough to the local banks to do the daily "clearing" (settlement of net funds from incoming and outgoing checks).  
District banks also supply paper money and coin that banks need to operate.  Having district banks reduces the distance armored trucks need to go to deliver it.  The district banks are generally located in the largest financial city in the area, again for efficiency.  The banks in the same city have the shortest distance to transport checks and cash.
Today, where most transactions are electronic, the bank locations are becoming a legacy, but people still write and mail paper checks.

You don't need a coin mixer to run an online market.  The fact that Silk Road provided a mixer is evidence of their intent.  So is setting it up behind Tor nodes.  It is not "proof" of intent by itself, merely evidence.  Internal emails saying that's why they set it up that way would be proof.  It's up to a jury to decide how much evidence or proof amounts to "beyond a reasonable doubt".
Further on that point, it should have been obvious to the Silk Road's operators that people were using it to sell drugs.  If they did nothing to stop it (Terms of Service, ejecting users that sold illegal items), that is more evidence of intent.
It would be different if a hosting provider has no knowledge of the goings-on for a particular site, because the site is entirely encypted on their servers, or it is just lost among 100,000 other sites they run.

The animal dying is the tragedy.  Short term gains, and failure to understand the consequences when everyone does it, are what lead to the problem.  In the village case, you can't double your herd instantly.  But you can save one more animal from the next litter to graze instead of eat immediately, and reap a short term gain.  You can keep adding one more animal from each litter to the grazing stock without immediate cost.  The problem shows up when every peasant in the village does the same thing. After a couple of years you have hundreds more livestock, and they eat all the grass down to bare dirt.
Villagers also ran pigs into the forest to eat acorns and other nuts.  But if they did that too often, eventually there would be no new oak trees, and therefore no firewood or lumber, or food for the pigs.  It might take a generation for lack of trees to show up, and in the mean time they reap fatter pigs.  Short term gain vs long term cost.  When the cost doesn't show up for a generation or two, people are more prone to ignore it, and leave it for the next generation to solve.  But by then it's too late.

I expect this to happen.  Among other things, miners have a lot of hardware investment these days, and when the reward goes down at the next halving, their income from new coins will decrease.  Thus they have an incentive to increase the size of blocks so as to capture more transaction fees.
Driving up the transaction fees by fighting for limited block space would also increase their fee income, but in the long term drives people away from bitcoins (why use it if the fees are high?)  That reduces demand for spending coins, and the *price* of the coins will drop.  Miner income includes both how many coins they earn, and how much each coin is worth, and it's in their interest to consider both parts of the problem.

This is exactly what the [Seed Factory Project's]( distributed MakerNet is intending to do.  Individuals or small businesses own automated machines like 3D printers, in various locations.  When you need something made, orders and payments go across the network to various machines and suppliers.  Escrowed bitcoins prove you have the funds, so the makers and suppliers are comfortable doing the work.  When their task is done, the funds are released.  Digital design files specifying what to make also go across the network.  Ideally, all the ordering, production, and payment would be automated, although in early versions there will be manual steps involved.
We are buying an R&amp;D location in Fairburn, GA (an Atlanta suburb) to develop and test this concept, and hope to start inviting people to join and build the network in the near future.  A fuller description of the concept can be found in our [Wikibook]( along with the related idea of self-expanding sytems.  That's where production nodes grow by making more machines for themselves.

You can have off-chain transactions.  For example, if you use a Coinbase wallet, and buy something from a Coinbase merchant, that's internal to Coinbase's books, and doesn't need to go out on the block chain.
If you have a number of merchant processors (and eventually banks and credit unions), they can settle up with each other with single bulk transactions on the block chain, and transmit the details of the included transactions directly as a data file.
You can also duplicate the bitcoin software and block chain with an identical version, and run multiple block chains in parallel.  Something like this is already happening with alt-coins, except they are not identical copies.
These adaptions are in addition to any changes that allow the original software to handle more transactions per second.  What I think is likely is that people will pool funds to run server-class nodes.  As long as there are lots of them, which are separately owned, the distributed nature of the network is preserved.  Web hosting companies will probably set up turnkey nodes, with N subscribers per node, to which the subscribers have access from their personal wallets.

The answer is at some point you want the current benefits of spending more than the future benefits of saving.  For example, nobody is going to hold a currency for future value if they are hungry and thirsty today.  Less urgently, people want a nice house and a nice car *today*, so they will spend today to get those things.
The exact same question applies to any investment that grows faster than inflation (real estate, high yield bonds, stocks in general).  It is still true if inflation is negative = deflation = currency is worth more instead of less over time.  People will require a risk premium for investments that are less sure than holding cash, and thus those investments will offer a return the same amount over the inflation/deflation rate as they do today.

That makes work for everyone, by having to move coins around.  A better approach would be to adjust the 4 year "halving" of block rewards to account for coins which have not moved in the previous 4 years (210,000 blocks).  So rather than 21 million total coins, you target 21 million "active" coins.  
Ones which are lost or held for very long investment in cold storage are not counted in the target.  But if you, for example, even pull out 1% from a cold storage address and the other 99% in change goes back to another cold storage address, the coins moved, and thus are counted as active coins, so long as it happened in the past 4 years.

This site has some more [up to date]( data, and graphs.
By the way, the 1 month inflation rate for bitcoin is 13.4%, because ASIC miners have been pumping up the hash rate and finding blocks faster. If we were at the nominal 10 minute average for blocks, the rate would currently be 10.4%.  Just before the next reward halving the rate should be 8.34%.  By then mining with ASICs should be saturated and no longer increasing the hash rate so quickly.  In fact, with the impending reward halving, I would expect some miners to get out of the business.  Just after the halving, the nominal coin production rate will drop to 4.17%, which puts it about average for world currencies.

The numerical reason is the block reward gets cut in half every 210,000 blocks.  It started at 50, is now 25, will be 12.5 at block 420,000, etc.  The sum of (50+25+12.5+6.25+...) is 100, and since there are 210,000 blocks in each interval, we have a total of 210,000 x 100 = 21,000,000.
The software reason is network nodes check new blocks for having the correct number for the "generation" transaction, which sends coins to the miner's address from no input (newly created coins).  Unless a majority of nodes changes the software to follow a different formula, blocks would be rejected and not passed along to other nodes.  A miner can put whatever they want in a block, but if the rest of the network rejects it, they wasted their time.
The economics reason is that Satoshi Nakamoto thought a finite money supply would prevent devaluation and encourage adoption.  As demand goes up against a finite supply, each bitcoin should rise in value, making them desirable.  Without a government to force you to use a particular currency, bitcoin had to be desirable on its own merits to gain traction.

None.  They are all still there in the Block Chain.  Some are *unspendable* because nobody has the private key for that address.  There is no way to tell unspendable from just "not spent yet".  Someone could have an active address, and unknown to them their hard drive has corrupted the wallet.dat file that holds the key, and they didn't bother to make a backup.  Even the owner doesn't know their coins are unspendable until the next time they try to make a transaction.
The question is also irrelevant.  Coins that never move are indistinguishable from long term savings.  Since there are 21 trillion "Bits" (the name we adopted for a microBitcoin), and each Bit is divisible to 100 Satoshi (the smallest unit recorded on the Block Chain), the available Bits are as much as all the world's existing currency combined in dollar terms.  If 50 or even 90% are unspendable, it won't affect the usability of Bitcoin.  It just means the active supply will be worth more per unit.

By that measure, bitcoin has about the same M1 money supply as Latvia, a nation of 2 million people.

Residential subdivision and commercial shopping center developers build roads all the time.  Access to the homes/shops increases their value more than the roads cost to build, so they build them.  For connector roads between such units, owner associations of people in the affected areas can finance them.
To give you a real world example, I deeded right of way to the county on some rural property I owned, so they could improve the unpaved road and install a new bridge across the stream.  The increased value of my property made it worth it.  If it was a community land-owner's association rather than the county, it would make no difference to the economics.

The Economist almost gets it.  They have figured out that ownership of any kind of asset can be encoded in a block chain.  But it goes further.  You can timestamp and validate the contents of *any kind of digital data whatsoever* with a chained hash system.  
Want to prove a security camera video hasn't been tampered with?  Make a hash of the video contents, then include the hash as data in a block chain.  You now have a timestamp for when the data was recorded, and proof of what it contained.
Want to prove you wrote a song, screenplay, or made an invention?  Hash it and stick it in a block chain.  Want to prove the NSA hasn't fucked with your software?  Make a hash of the code and stick it in a block chain.
The technology goes well beyond just proof of ownership.

I'm glad I was able to answer your questions.  
The Seed Factory Project is open source, and distributed production is inherently not localized in one place.  However there is an inverse relationship between value/mass and how far it makes sense to ship components.  Design files can travel anywhere in the world, but the factory buildings need concrete, and shipping the gravel and sand very far is not economic.  Therefore we are looking for a location near Atlanta, GA to do the R&amp;D work, as it's a big enough city to supply all the heavy items, and there is already an active "Maker" community.


No, there's quite a lot of that knowledge around already, and we plan to use it.  One of the first things I did was compile a technical library.  The main adaptions from conventional automation are (a) specifically design the various machines so they can make parts for more of themselves, and (b) networking them, so it can be distributed and not one big centralized factory.


The "Seed Factory" (the starter kit of machines), and the expanded factory it grows into, qualify as a form of artificial life, in the same way a plant seed grows into a mature plant.  Energy production, self growth according to a template, etc. are among the features we use to define living things, and such a factory does many of them.  To the extent it needs humans to operate it, though, it is not a fully autonomous organism.

They don't need to mess with it.  The Block Chain gives them perfect visibility on every bitcoin transaction around the world (just like it does for everyone else).

Manufacturing project here.  When you have to deal with physical things, it takes longer than pure software.  For example, we signed a contract to buy an R&amp;D location over a month ago.  The transaction hasn't closed yet, so there is not much else we can do - we need a physical space to work.

I sent you a private message with contact email and some more links.
Since I'm in the USA near Atlanta, I don't expect you would be able to get physically involved, but you could certainly help with software and hardware design if you have those skills, or organize a local project to build one of the pieces of machinery.  
We will also need to raise capital to build hardware.  I ran a fundraiser at  which reached 200% of the goal (we got direct contributions in addition to the crowdfunding), and the amazing increase in bitcoin value means we are not pressed to raise additional funds at the moment, but once we get into serious hardware mode it will most likely be necessary.  Although all the designs and technology we develop will be open source, contributors will get a share of the outputs from whatever hardware we build, so that is an incentive.
I agree that self-production will help underdeveloped areas, and that is one of the motivations to open-source our work.  We are not the first such project,  started a similar one a few years ago, and I participated in it, but they decided on a list of machines before doing the "systems engineering" to find out which ones you really need, and their tech level is fairly low and not integrated.  We may end up outputting some of their designs as products, so it is not entirely separate, and certainly not competitive.  More a parallel work on similar ideas.
On the rest of your comment, for now, self-production allows living beneath the notice of the existing system, and in the future, high levels of automation will allow living in remote areas where governments are not strong.  As a last resort, we can always program the factory to make firearms and killer robots :-).  In the long run, what I hope is a shift in people's thinking about what they need a government for.  In a post-scarcity world, you don't need to invade other countries to secure the flow of resources, and in turn that would cut the number of people so angry at you they want to blow things up.  Thus approval for things like a massive military would fade.

Two keys are mathematically linked, for example the prime factors of a very large number.  One is kept secret, the other is public.  If someone wants to send you a secret message, they use the public key to encrypt it, and then only you know the private key to decrypt it.
In bitcoin, the private key is used to digitally "sign" a transaction for a given address.  Since the address is derived from the public key, the digital signature for the transaction, plus the public data of the transaction, can be used to verify the transaction is valid, since only someone knowing the private key can generate the correct signature for that transaction.
The keys are stored in your "wallet" files, and the software uses them as needed to create a transaction message.  Most users only come in contact with the associated address.

And not buy food or pay rent?  This argument is dumb because most people have required spending for short term needs, regardless of inflation, deflation, or stability.  Since they spend most of what they earn in a given pay period, a small amount of deflation (like 2% a year) won't matter.
The converse of this argument says that under inflation, nobody will save - they will spend it all.  The existence of Wall Street contradicts this prediction.  What intelligent investors do is adjust expected investment returns for inflation, to get the "real" return.  If inflation is -2% (ie deflation) instead of +2%, it doesn't change how you determine real return, just the input values.
There will be adjustments in the market to account for different real returns and cost of borrowing, but people will still spend, save, etc.

A self-interested person might not even care about a 51% attack.  When it happens, they buy up cheap coins, and wait for a software fix to prevent it happening again.  For example, have the bitcoin software reject blocks coming from the same IP address as any of the last 3 blocks.  That idea doesn't have more than a few seconds thought in it, and is easy to work around (multiple IP addresses), but it's an example of the *type* of workaround for the attack.

I disagree. It is 22 GB at present, which is trivial compared to having a data center in Utah 1.5 times the size of Google's data center in Douglasville, GA (near Atlanta).  It could grow thousands of times in size and still fit in one server.


That's probably the strongest argument *against* the theory.  Senior spy agency officials would have to have a lot of foresight to set up bitcoin intentionally.  I find it more likely someone did it as a hobby project or independent research and not for work directly.
I used to do a lot of that when I worked at Boeing's space systems division.  We had our main-line contracts (Inertial Upper Stage, Sea Launch, Space Station), but I also worked on new ideas.  You had to work on those so you would have something ready when the current contracts ran out.

History is not a prediction of the future, but in the past the [bitcoin price]( has gone in cycles of sharp rises followed by a partial retreat and relatively stable period.  
Based on that pattern, we might see another sharp rise in 3-6 months, but there is no guarantee.  If there is such a rise, my guess is it would be Wall Street-driven.  They have been busy this year setting up trading mechanisms, and once they are functional, they will want to attract customers.  So that means advertising/media, which could set off another hype cycle.
It's also possible we are done with cyclical spikes, and will only see organic growth as demand to use and store bitcoins grows, and as the supply of new coins declines as mining saturates.  Since Jan 2013 we have averaged 4,317 coins/day mining, when the theoretical rate should be 3,600, a 20% oversupply.  That was caused by a 2,666-fold increase in hash rate/difficulty.  At some point it will no longer be worth adding more mining hardware, and the supply of new coins will therefore drop.  Combined with increasing demand, that could lead to a price rise.

The homesteading of new land in the United States makes a good analogy.  Originally unsettled land was allocated in blocks of 640 acres (1785 to 1800), then halved to 320 acres (1800-1862), and then halved again to 160 acres (1862-1976).  This parallels the block rewards.  Thereafter the blocks of land could be split up and resold in smaller pieces, just like miners can split up the block rewards.
If we equate the original block reward of 50 BTC to the original land blocks in the US (1 square mile), then the total number of bitcoins to be mined would equal 420,000 square miles, about the size of Texas and California combined.  One bitcoin would then be 12.8 acres, one mBTC would be 557.568 square feet, and 1 Satoshi = 0.8029 square inches.
Transactions then are deeds transferring ownership of some land parcels, and the block chain serves the function of the vault in the county courthouse where all the deeds are recorded.

I'll be happy to use nano-fabricators once they become available.  For now, though, I have to work with what is available **now**, not something that might be available in the future.
Why a solar furnace?  Abundant energy is needed to run all your automation, and furnaces are used in many industrial processes.  You can also use the heat to run an electrical generator.  But the key feature of a solar furnace is it can make parts for another furnace.  You mainly need metal for the framework, and glass for the mirrors.  A furnace can take scrap metal and glass, and melt them to cast more metal parts and mirror blanks.

There are other reasons besides profit to do mining on a large scale.  For example, suppose you are a corrupt Chinese party official, and you want to move your funds out of the country and avoid getting caught.  You could turn your funds into bitcoin by mining, and then easily move them elsewhere.  You might find it acceptable to take a small loss on mining, since the alternative is paying taxes or going to jail.

"A bitcoin" is just the unit of measure of transactions in the block chain, the way "a meter" is a unit of length.  Otherwise you are transferring bare unitless numbers from one address to another.
However, it is possible to use a block chain for other things than recording currency transactions.  A hash is a checksum calculated from some data.  When the data is being added to constantly, a chain of hashes gives you a periodic checksum linked to previous ones.
This is useful to prevent data corruption, but when the data itself is low value, you don't also have to secure it with lots of difficulty.  As an example, say you are recording weather data for later historical or scientific analysis.  You are constantly adding new data each day, and want to be sure the data storage and transmission hasn't corrupted it.  A block chain would be useful for this purpose.  But not many people would be motivated to alter past data maliciously, there's no financial incentive.  So your hash difficulty is set by how secure you want the weather history, not by how much someone could make with a 51% attack.

A server owned by 100 people isn't an "institution", it's more like a club.  But for example, my local credit union could host such a server once bitcoin use became common enough to justify it.  Credit unions are member-owned cooperatives, and I already trust them with my personal finances.  So hosting a block chain would not be added risk.
Now, I would not trust Bank of America very much, they are very centralized, but my credit union is a short drive from where I live, and small.  As long as there are many such block chain hosts, all separately owned, we should be OK.

Bitpay and Coinbase recycle the coins on exchanges or selling them to their customers.  This increases the supply of coins on the market.  If everyone who spends coins at a merchant then buys an equal amount to replenish their wallets, it balances out.  
But we likely have a lot of early adopters who bought/mined their coins cheap and haven't had any place to spend them till now.  They don't need to replenish them, because they have lots that are worth way more than they cost.  So the net effect is more selling than buying.

The first coinage acts of 1792 and 1793.  They determined the silver content of the Spanish Silver Dollar and set the US coin to be the same.  That way they could circulate at parity.  That's why the silver dollar is an odd fraction (0.7734 oz troy) of silver weight.
Spanish dollars were already in common circulation in the colonies.  Since the early US government didn't collect much in taxes, and it took actual silver to mint their own coins, it took time to make enough to replace the Spanish coins.  Thus the Spanish coins were legal tender for 65 years.

Unfortunately you will need to invent subspace communications before you can extend the bitcoin network beyond ~300 light-seconds (0.6 AU, less than the *average* distance to Mars).  That distance implies a 300 second time delay for light signals, which is too long to prevent double spending at remote locations.  
You can still send individual transactions from great distances, but they won't be confirmed until the Earth miners receive it and then send the blocks back out.  But relay nodes and miners that are too far away will be out of sync with the rest of the network, and thus ineffective for preventing various attacks.
You can create local block chains on your starship, or just do centralized record-keeping aboard, but they would not be synced with the rest of the Federation until you can communicate with another ship, starbase, or planet to relay the data.

We just bought an R&amp;D location near Atlanta to prototype the starter kit machines (seed factory) and distributed network (MakerNet).  Not everyone needs every robot and machine at their house full time.  How often do you need new furniture made, for example?  So it makes sense to have a network of machines, and people who know how to operate them, for when you need something made.  Then you pay with bitcoins, or trade for stuff you make.
The network self-expands by making parts for new machines and robots.  So once it gets going, it becomes very low cost.  Instead of buying everything at retail, you make it internally.

They are not a retail fund, dealing directly with customers.  A basket is a big lump of their shares, which they will sell to brokers, who in turn can resell them to individuals.  Funding a basket can be in cash or directly in bitcoins.  If in cash, then the fund has to go out and buy enough BTC to back it.  Either way, the broker gets back fund shares, which it can then trade like any other shares.  
Raw bitcoins are not as easy to trade on the financial markets, because not everyone is set up to accept them.  As shares, though, they are easily traded for any other financial asset through their existing systems.

The same way they track dollars - badly.  An estimated 20% of the US economy is "Underground", i.e. not reported.  That includes the "black market" (illegal and unreported), and the "off the books" sector (otherwise legal but unreported).  Yet another segment of the economy is "Sheltered" - reported but not fully taxed.  That's everything from personal use of company vehicles to offshore schemes by major corporations.
The IRS only has 42,000 people devoted to enforcement ( see page 5 of  )  That's simply not enough people to chase after everyone that under-reports, uses questionable deductions, etc.  They use cross-checking against information returns (1099's and such), and statistical methods to try and pick victims who will produce the most collections for the effort they put in.  I call it an inverse lottery.  If your name comes up, you lose.
Bitcoin doesn't file information returns, although payment processors like Coinbase and BitPay might, and so might businesses the same way they file them for dollar-based transactions.  If you avoid situations where those may get filed with your name on it, and avoid fiat/bitcoin conversions through a regulated institution, it becomes very hard to track.

@_date: 2014-01-06 18:50:54
Bitcoins don't exist as separate entities like paper currencies with a serial number.  What the block chain and individual transactions deal with are "addresses", and a numerical amount moving from one to another.
The "generate" transaction is the first one in each block, and the miner that finds the block hash directs the output of that transaction to an address of their choosing (usually their own).  Generate transactions have no input, so the result is an increase in the total amount in the block chain.
The numerical amounts are just numbers, but we treat them as a "balance" tied to an address, and the units are called "bitcoins".  The smallest fraction tracked is 0.000 000 01, which is given the name "1 Satoshi".
The current balance on an address is the sum of all past transactions in and out of that address.  The Block Chain is a permanent history of all past transactions.  So first you look up any past transactions for that address and add them up, then your bitcoin client software looks at recent transactions that have arrived on the network but not in a block yet.  Those are stored in a "memory pool" until they get blockified.  You then apply any recent transactions to the balance to get the current balance.
Balances are what actually are tracked, "bitcoins" are just the unit of measure like meters or seconds.  You can't hold a bitcoin in your hand any more than a meter or second, its just how you measure balances.
@_date: 2014-08-28 13:38:48
It is more analogous to a lump of gold, which comes in variable sizes, but which we measure by units of weight of fixed size.  Various lumps of different sizes can be put in a container, analogous to a bitcoin wallet.  A transaction is then like taking entire lumps or pieces sawed off of them, and melting them together into one or more new lumps, and sending the resulting lumps to new destinations.  Of course, being digital makes that process vastly easier.
"To coin" historically meant to take variable lumps of non-standard purity, and melt/stamp them into uniform lumps with identifying markings.  That made trade easier because you didn't have to weigh and assay each lump, just count them.  "A coin" as a noun was then the uniform lumps that resulted.  That doesn't really match up with bitcoin, because we generally don't form uniform lumps in transactions.

Every stage of human culture, from the old stone age up until today, has had such a set.  Everything we have at a given point in time was made with tools and machines that existed before that time.  Thus not only can you copy your tools, you can make better ones.
As a simple example, with nothing but sticks, animal sinew/vines, and rocks, you can build a furnace, dig up ore, and chop up wood and make charcoal.  With this furnace, you can smelt the ore into raw iron, which you can hammer with rocks when hot into a large lump and a small lump.  The large lump becomes a crude anvil, and putting a wood handle on the small lump gives you a crude hammer.  If you want to get fancy you can heat-treat your lumps to make them harder.  With a crude hammer and anvil, you can now make better tools like blacksmiths have done throughout history.  
The next set of tools are chisels, knives, and tongs, and pretty soon you have an industrial revolution.  Even today, the descendents of blacksmiths make robots and machine tools (machines that cut metal parts) using other robots and machine tools.  However, not all the parts of a robot are steel or aluminum alloy, so you need some *other* machines to wind coils for electric motors and other bits like that that are not just accurately shaped pieces of metal.
Our project is bringing back a compact set that can mostly make itself.  Civilization has gone the route of mostly large specialized factories that do one kind of thing.  So a set of conventional factories that can copy all the factories ends up looking like the whole of industry.

Like most big corporations, JP Morgan Chase is mostly owned by ["institutional investors"](  Those are mutual funds, retirement funds, hedge funds, university endowments, and other pooled asset funds.  In turn, the asset funds typically represent individual investors, but the individuals don't have a say in how their assets are invested or voted on corporate questions.  
Thus ownership and control are separated.  Control resides in the fund managers, who in the aggregate have enough voting shares to tell the board of directors and officers of the company what to do.  Usually they don't have to.  Everyone on Wall Street shares the goal of maximizing profits.  It's only when the profits are not flowing fast enough that they influence the board to do something (replace the CEO, divest, merge, etc.)
When you look at the list of institutional investors, you will see other banks among the top holders.  It is not the bank itself, but bank as representative for their private banking and brokerage operations.  Calling out the Rothschilds is ancient history.  There are in fact a bunch of wealthy people who control a big chunk of all the big corporations, but it is way more diverse than one family, and the control is mostly indirect through fund managers.

My suggestion is to double the block size every time the mining reward halves.  That allows miners to earn more transaction fees to replace the reward.  It is also a simple to code change, and predictable for everyone.  It works out to an equivalent of 19% per year increase, which should not burden things like bandwidth and hard drive spce too much.  Thus it would go to 2 MB in about two years, and 4 MB in about 6 years.

There's a name for this, the Gartner ["Hype Cycle"](  Without media hype, expectations for a technology would rise along with the actual usefulness of a technology.  That would connect bioacoustic sensing with virtual reality on the 2013 version of the graph, and then continue along the line to the right of that.
The media, however, is always looking for stories to write about, and they have a strong herd instinct.  So when one of them latches onto a "good story", it tends to get copied and repeated among the media.  People less familiar with the new technology get impressed, start investing in it, which generates further stories, and the hype feeds on itself.  Eventually reality sets in as people figure out what you can actually do with a given technology.
You will note the shape of the hype curve pretty much matches the recurrent swings in bitcoin price.  Since price is driven by supply vs demand, and some of the demand is driven by hype, we get those swings.  It's less easy to measure the amount of hype for something like 3D Printers (a currently over-hyped technology).

First of all, sorry for the slow reply.  I'm in the middle of moving to Atlanta for a bitcoin-related startup.
Second, your analysis is correct for an instant in time.  But mining farms have a significant investment in equipment, and would like to keep earning income from it.  If blocks never grow in size, then fees eventually drive users off-chain, or to conventional banking alternatives.
Ideally you want to have fees low enough to entice more users, but the quantity of TXs to grow over time so as to collect more total fees.  That compensates for the declining block reward.  Doubling every 4 years (19% per year) is my suggestion for expanding the block size about as fast as network use grows, and thus keep fees in the competitive price range.

A bank keeps a database of account numbers and what the balance is for each account.  Bitcoin does the same thing without the need for a trusted third party like a bank.
Bitcoin "account numbers" are a long string called an "address", that looks like 1Hfxy1j4uJknLzAKhjrNPXpCGmzPGX3PPQ.  It is calculated from a cryptographic key which you keep secret.  Almost all transactions simply move a balance from one or more input addresses to one or more output addresses.  The exception is the special "generation" transaction which creates new coins, it does not have an input.
Blocks are mainly a set of transactions collected by "miners", for which they have found a hard-to-find hash (a checksum) based on the contents of the block.  It's easy for everyone else to recalculate the hash and compare it to the published value, and prove the contents are not altered.  In addition to transactions, a block contains the hash of the *previous* block, and a random number (nonce) that miners vary until the resulting hash output meets a difficult test.
Since the hash of the current block verifies the contents have not been changed, it also verifies the hash value of the previous block, which you can compare to the value you get by hashing the previous block.  If they match, then you know the prevous block has not been altered too.  
Since each block is linked to the previous one in this way, we call it a "block chain", and can verify that no part of any past block has been altered.  In fact, every full copy of the bitcoin software does exactly this, calculating the hash of each block in order and comparing it to the hash value stored in the next block, right up to the present.
Since the block chain includes every valid bitcoin transaction ever, every copy of the software can independently calculate the balance of any address, simply by adding up all the inputs and outputs from it.  Since everyone can do this for themselves, you don't need to trust anyone else, like a bank, to report the balances.
Finding a proper hash value is intentionally difficult, so the whole network of miners only finds one on average every ten minutes.  If you try to change an old transaction, you now have to find a proper hash value for the block it is in **and every one after it**, because they are linked.  The longest chain of blocks is the one everyone accepts as valid.  So to make a change, you would need more computing power than the rest of the network combined so that you can update all the following blocks faster than the honest miners are adding to the main chain.  
Thus changing old transaction data is extraordinarily difficult.  This is the great invention contained in bitcoin - digital data you can't change without it being obvious.  We are using it to record monetary transactions, but the same method can be applied to **any kind of data whatsoever** - contracts, property deeds, verifying the date of creation of an invention or a song.

I used a dining table as a simple example of the production chain from forest to your front door, but you are right that most people would want to see an actual table.  In that respect it was perhaps a poor choice.  But then the size of Amazon and other online retailers is a counter to your statement.  
In the near future, virtual-reality headsets would allow inspecting the 3D model of a table, and smartphones can already give you live video of the lumber that would be used.  It's not a very big step to imagine scanning the lumber to be used, grain and everything, then rendering it in 3D to show exactly how the finished product will look.


That's a "push" production system. You make stuff and then hope to sell it.  I'm describing a "pull" system, where things are made to order.


That goes back to the "Distributed Production Network" I'm working on.  Existing nodes (home workshops, small businesses, individuals) collaborate on building a new node - I will stick with a woodworking shop as an example.  You need a table saw, band saw, and other tools.  The CAD files for the machinery already exist, so they just go ahead and build them.  At first, the other nodes own the equipment.  Over time, the woodworker buys his machines by incorporating his labor.  Either he starts making stuff for other people in the network, or sells products to outside customers.  It's a form of venture financing, but via physical stuff rather than money.
Our [Seed Factories Project]( is working on how you bootstrap such a network from either a small starter kit (the "Seed"), or from a group of existing businesses and workshops.  We will be launching our website shortly, and looking for an R&amp;D site near Atlanta where we can build and test prototypes of the machines.

I'm not sure what you mean by the credit aspect.  Let's take as an example a dining table.  Traditionally you would buy it from a store, who in turn gets it from a manufacturer, who gets his wood from a lumber mill, who gets it from a logger.  Each of those businesses may or may not use supplier credit or bank financing to cover between the time they order the supplies and pay the workers, and when they get paid by the next merchant up the chain.
In the distributed production model I described, payment goes directly from the end customer to each of the businesses individually.  So the logger gets paid as soon as the lumber mill reports he has the logs in hand.  The lumber mill gets paid as soon as the furniture manufacturer reports the cut and dried wood has arrived.  We skip the store and ship from the manufacturer direct to the customer, who makes final payment when the shipment arrives.  The various businesses are not out-of-pocket to the previous supplier, so they don't have finance as much.

I agree, that's why I said the bitcoin unit price is only an indicator, the way stock prices are an indicator of underlying company value.  Stock prices vary a lot more than the underlying assets, but over a long enough term they tend to move more or less together.
I think eventually someone will figure out a good way to estimate the economic value of the bitcoin network, perhaps by estimating the savings over other methods of moving money, or by comparing it to competitors (i.e. if it moves some fraction of what Western Union moves, it should be worth that fraction of WU's value).

Clever math makes the total balances on the Block Chain limited.  Being digital makes them easy to trade.  "One bitcoin" is what we call a balance of 1.000 on the Block Chain.

Two things are called "bitcoin".
First is the Bitcoin protocol, network, and software.  This enables making and recording transactions between people.  Since this is a proper noun, it is capitalized.
The second is the unit of measure for the size of a transaction.  This is written "2.24 bitcoins" like we write "2.24 meters", uncapitalized.
Part of the Bitcoin software is a distributed public ledger that records transactions between "addresses" (i.e account numbers).  It's called the "Block Chain", where blocks are sets of transactions verified by a checksum (hash), and chained because the previous hash is part of the data in the following block, which then gets its own hash, etc.  So all the blocks are linked in order.
If you have an up-to-date version of the block chain, you can calculate the balance of every address, simply by adding up all the transactions to and from that address, much like a check book register.  "A bitcoin" is simply the way to describe a balance of 1.00000000.  Balances can't leave the Block Chain, they can only move from one address to another.  So all 13.412 million bitcoins in existence (so far) are located on the Block Chain.
The properties of the protocol, network, and software are what give those balances value.  The unit name you apply to the balances is just a description, it has no value by itself, any more than "2 meters" does. "Two meters of cloth" has a value, because you apply the measurement to some entity.  "An address balance on the Block Chain of 2 bitcoins" also has a value, because you can trade that balance for other things.

This is also true of everything else in the world (and out of this world).  Things only have the value that people assign to them, and that value is measured in what people are willing to give up in exchange for the thing they want.  Each person can have a different value for a given item, and the same person can have different values at different times.
The idea that things have inherent underlying values is a mirage.  Widely traded commodities have relatively stable exchange rates/market prices because lots of people exhibit their personal values. An average results when the people who want it more and the people who want something else more reach agreement and execute trades.
What increases personal valuations is the usefulness or desirability of an item.  Automobiles are very useful in the US, so most everyone is willing to give up other things in order to get one, establishing a market price.  Luxury cars are only marginally more useful than economy ones.  They are however much more desirable as a status symbol.
The usefulness of the Bitcoin Network is in the ability to move value quickly and with low fees from place to place.  The bitcoin unit is needed to use the Network, so it derives value from it.  The unit also is desirable as a scarce good that can store value over time.  They have the expectation they can trade it later for something they want in the future.


You think there are physical dollars or other fiat currency stored in the bank vault?  It's just entries in a computer, the same as bitcoin.  The bank has loaned out depositor's funds at interest.  So what you really have is a promise based on a data entry, to reclaim your funds after the loans get paid back.  The 2007 financial crisis shows what happens when the loans don't get paid back.

Drugs, money laundering, terrorists, and child porn are just the modern boogeymen to scare people into giving our masters more power.  The message is "give us more power, and we will protect you from these scary people".  In past generations they used anarchists, socialists, and communists, but the purpose is the same.
The problem with boogeymen is eventually people lose their fear of them.  Once upon a time "reefer madness" made people scared of drug-crazed black musicians, but these days states are legalizing cannabis.  So the masters have to find a new boogeyman or three.
The important thing is to realize they are using scare tactics. Focus on the real criminals, not the tools that are just as useful for legitimate purposes.  Ask them about the cost/benefit ratio.

The bitcoin exchange rate is dictated by the daily supply and demand on the exchanges.  In turn, demand comes from people wanting to spend immediately or hold for longer periods.  These have different effects.  Someone who buys on Coinbase, then uses those coins at TigerDirect, who in turn passes the coins back to Coinbase or BitPay has no net effect on the market.  Someone who buys and holds withdraws coins from the supply side, thus driving the price up.
Daily volatility comes from daily fluctuations in supply and demand.  The larger the market, the smaller individual decisions' effects become.  What you are left with is larger news and events that change people's propensity to hold for the longer term.

I just treat them as a convenient leakage path from fiat to BTC.  I buy coins once a month, and as soon as they arrive, I send them to my own wallet.  Paying for them via ACH is convenient.  If Coinbase becomes too annoying, I will look for another way to get them.
Once enough fiat has leaked over, and bitcoin has a full ecosystem (earning as well as spending), we can mostly dispense with sites like Coinbase.

Generally not.  Nodes in the network relay transactions in seconds.  Each node checks a transaction against the block chain, and the memory pool of recent transactions.  If there is not enough balance the transaction is not relayed to other nodes.
If you are at a gas station, then the likely path from your device to the rest of the network will be the same for both transactions.  Thus only your first payment goes through.  If you have a custom app to send your balance to yourself at another address, and then pay for gas before the station owner can see that address was depleted, you would have to complete both transactions within seconds of each other.
(If you had enough balance to do both transactions, it's not a double spend.  That's just making two different purchases close together in time.

Sorry, but this is incorrect.
A given address has an associated balance found by summing all the previous input and output transactions on the block chain + memory pool (recent transactions not yet in a block).  So if the coins are anywhere, they are on the block chain as address balances.


No.  Key pairs are generated, one private and one public per pair.  A bitcoin address is calculated from the public key by a hard to reverse formula.  A wallet file stores one or more private keys, and usually the public key and address that goes with it.  The private key, obviously, is the part you keep secret.  The wallet software usually encrypts the wallet file(s) and manages passwords so you can spend it.

If you plan to hold bitcoins for the long term, as opposed to buying on a regular basis and spending them, any site not under your control is a risk.  Coinbase is a safe place to *buy* the coins (lots of people use them, no scams, few problems, decent customer service).  But I move control of the coins to my own account once they are bought.
Bitcoin balances actually only exist on the shared transaction ledger (the "Block Chain"), but individuals have secret cryptographic keys that allow you to send a balance from an address of yours (account) to someone else.  A wallet file is a container for those keys, and can be backed up as may places as you want.  The raw keys can also be printed out and stuck in a bank deposit box, or engraved on metal and buried in your back yard.
The important thing is to keep it secret from anyone else, and then the balances will be safe on the block chain (which is un-alterable).

I've been around long enough to have observed a general rule of media:
Civilization is complicated, and writers for generalist media like Time magazine cannot be experts in everything.  Writers for specialist media (trade magazines, single-topic blogs, etc.) have more time to learn about their topic *and* their readers tend to know more about it.  So their quality will be better for both reasons - more time to learn, and their readers are better at detecting bullshit, and will therefore go elsewhere if there is too much.
For the past 15 years my preferred method of keeping up with the news is a list of bookmarks for specialist sites (including this subreddit).  I'll check a general news site like CNN for breaking news, but don't read them as a habit.

Chained hash proof-of-work is how the bitcoin Block Chain prevents data tampering.  A hash is a checksum calculated from the contents of some data.  In bitcoin that data is mostly a "block" (collection) of recent transactions.  It also includes the hash result of the **previous** block.  If you change any of the data in a block, the hash result changes unpredictably.  You can easily check for tampering (or just data corruption) by recalculating the hash, and comparing it to the value stored in the next block.  
If you try to change any of data, you would have to also change the next block storing the hash result **and every block after it**, because changing any data in a block changes the hash.  Since the blocks are linked together by their hashes, we call it the "Block Chain".  But this system works for any kind of data, not just blocks of bitcoin transactions.  So the more general description is "chained hashes" that prove the given data was not tampered with.  It's not just one checksum, but a whole series of them, where each one proves the previous one has not been changed.


The same way we teach a 5 year old to store data on a hard drive.  By hiding the gory details with software.  I run Windows 7 on this PC, and frankly I have no idea how the internals of the NTFS file system works, or the Microsoft OneDrive cloud storage.  It's abstracted by layers of software, so all I have to know is how to drag a file into a folder on my screen with my mouse.
A "Proof of Existence and Contents" app would have a right click menu item, or drag and drop, and take whatever data is selected, hash it, insert the hash into a block chain, and give you a link to find it later if you need to prove the contents existed at a particular time.  It might be the bitcoin block chain, or it might be a separate distributed recordkeeping system used by business people, lawyers, and others who need provable records.

To expand on introshine's post:
* Each node on the bitcoin network examines incoming transactions for validity.  That includes checking the block chain and memory pool (recent transactions not yet in a block) to see if there were enough funds to make the transaction.  If the inputs are sufficient, and all the other tests on the transaction check out, it gets passed to other nodes.  Otherwise it is dropped.  
So if a transaction arrives at a distant part of the network, it has already been checked several times by different nodes.  If a competing transaction using the same inputs (double spend attempt) arrived first at some nodes, it would be in the memory pool even before getting into a block.  It would prevent the other transaction from getting passed further.
Checking transactions and relaying them happens in a matter of seconds.  If several well-connected nodes, like blockchain.info, BitPay, and your own node as a business, all report the transaction as valid, there is a very high probability it will end up in the block chain.
* The exact probability is a matter of research and testing (attempting double spends).  If we can quote to a merchant that "given these sites showing the transaction, after x seconds it is 99.y% likely to be confirmed in a block", they can decide for themselves whether to accept it, or wait for confirmations.  Alternately, services like BitPay can guarantee payment to the merchant if certain conditions are met (i.e. maturity of the inputs, size of the transaction, etc.), and eat the occasional double spend as a business expense.  They then have a strong incentive to improve their approval algorithm.
* Rather than just putting dollar ranges on how many confirms to wait, I would rather see probabilities.  For example "after 3 confirms, the chances of the transaction failing are 1 in N".  Users can then decide how long they want to wait.
The only statistics I know of are from [Blochain.info]( which shows 50 double spends in the last ~90,000 transactions.  Most of these will eventually resolve themselves.  A total of 200, including the 50 recent ones, covers the last 16 months, or ~33 million transactions.  Perhaps a good user rule is if your transaction shows up on that page, put it on hold until it is resolved.

Seriously, if you buy USD 100 worth of bitcoins and spend them in the same month for coffee and donuts, the IRS won't chase after you for capital gains tax unless the price went up like last November.  If it does go up like last November, take the average for the month, subtract your cost, and report the difference.  That will be "close enough for government work".  And if you did spend $300 on coffee in one month (100 buy, adjusted for Novembers price gains), talk to Mark Karpeles on where to get a bulk discount on fancy coffee (that's humor).
The tax tables round your income into $50 increments for computing the final tax owed.  Differences smaller than that have no effect on what you owe, so the IRS just doesn't care.  They care about big items that are worth their time to collect, not every Frappuchino or yard sale.

That's a fallacy.  People still need to eat, keep a roof over their head, spend on health care, etc.  They will spend what they need to for current needs, regardless of what the currency value will be in the future.
Now substitute "stocks" for your statement above:


That's not a problem.  That's called "investing for retirement" or some such thing.  And once bitcoin is better developed, there will be bitcoin-denominated investments that will return more than just holding the coins, so they will be put to work in the economy.  We have not reached that point yet, bitcoin is too new and volatile, but if it gets adopted on a mass scale it will happen.

"Destroyed" is a bad description, though, the coins are still in existence.  I prefer something like "coin inertia" (for accumulated BTC-days not moved) and "coin momentum" (for current movement of coins).
Thus the longer a coin sits unmoving the more inertia it accumulates, and when it moves the greater the momentum it acquires.
Another way to describe it is "coin maturity", how well-aged the coins are, like the age for a wine or scotch.  So 50,000 BTC x 2.5 years since last transaction would be 125,000 coin-years of maturity.

There is "money" - anything accepted as an intermediary in trade, so that you don't have to directly barter for things.  Then there is "currency" - money that is authorized or issued by a government, and "legal tender", types of money required to be accepted as payment for debts.  These are distinct legal categories.
Bitcoin is clearly money, since 50,000 merchants accept it in trade.  No government has authorized or issued it, so it is not a formal currency yet, and it is far from being a legal tender.
As an example of "authorized" currency, we have the [bank notes]( issued by our drug cartel money laundering friends at HSBC.  They print the majority of bank notes used in Hong Kong, by permission of the local government.  If Iceland were to authorize the use of Auroracoins, then that would become a currency in that country.
Spanish and Mexican silver dollars were legal tender until 1857.  When the United States starting minting it's own money, other sliver coins were in common circulation, and it took time for the mint to acquire enough silver to produce US coins to replace them.  Unlike fiat currencies, precious metals are in limited supply.  So the foreign coins are an example of something that stopped being authorized, and are no longer a local currency.

I'm reading a book on the history of political theory, and in Plato's *Republic* he imagined a philosopher-king who would be wise and incorruptible, as the best form of government.  Unfortunately humans are self-interested and eminently corruptible, and of limited wisdom individually.  So he settled for a second-best answer in the form of a leader and partial democracy, that can act as checks on each other.
Open software allows us to gather the wisdom of many people into the code, and implement it in a form that is not easily corrupted by self-interest.  It can be applied to one aspect of society at a time, unlike governments which impose themselves on everything at once.  Thus we can incrementally improve how society functions, and approach an ideal that was not possible with humans as the gears and levers of the social machine.
Central banks are not even second-best options.  They are oligarchies or tyrants in their sphere of operation.  So they should be replaced by something better.

Earlier this month, a friend called Mats, who works in banking in Switzerland, set off on a long holiday in Bali for a spell of relaxation between jobs. Hoping to forget about finance for a while, he duly booked himself into a modest hotel in Ubud, a far-flung resort famous for yoga retreats.
But when he arrived in his tropical idyll he got a shock: the seemingly otherworldly location is in the midst of a striking monetary experiment. Over the past year, dozens of local merchants in this part of Bali have started accepting payment in Bitcoin, the electronic exchange system that is sometimes dubbed a cryptocurrency. Such is the enthusiasm for this financial innovation that Ubud was even staging a so-called Bitcoin festival, pulling people in from all over the world.
“I have never seen anything like this,” Mats declared. If you want to be a hippy in 2014, you do not just need to wear a sarong and do yoga: one of the hottest ways to become subversive or countercultural is to pay your bar bill in Bitcoin. Even, or especially, in Bali.
It is a fascinating sign of how tightly entwined the global economy has become today. And how potentially peculiar too. On one level, the appearance of an alternative — quasi-subversive — currency is not wildly new. After all, investors have been putting money into gold for many decades, partly because they do not trust governments (or banks). And this mistrust has been rising rapidly in recent years, as western monetary experiments keep gathering pace — hence all those gold bars now sitting in Swiss banks.
But what is striking about the Bitcoin experiment is that it takes the issue of trust to a new level. Instead of relying on governments and banks to underpin currencies, investors are essentially placing their faith in a complicated piece of cryptography and software, maintained by a community of volunteers and users with possibly conflicted interests and diverse levels of skill and commitment – and people have as little knowledge about how it really works as they have about Wall Street financial products or central bank balance sheets. To my mind, at least, that almost makes it seem rational to have faith in gold bars.
Consider for a moment how the Bitcoin project works. The currency first emerged some five years ago, when a mysterious computer expert called Satoshi Nakamoto created an online payment system using open-sourced software. This, essentially, is a peer-to-peer exchange system — using a unit of value known as Bitcoin — that does not require a central administrator or repository, since payments are recorded in a central public electronics ledger, which is maintained by the community. 
In theory, this community element is supposed to give users more independence. It is also meant to confer greater credibility to currency than fiat money. After all, the beauty of using Bitcoin is that you do not need to rely on costly and slow-moving bank payment systems: “money” can be sent to or exchanged anywhere in the world. And the value of that money will not be wiped out if a government suddenly decides to turn on the printing press. Instead, the number of Bitcoins in circulation can only increase at a fixed rate each year, and in 2140 the total supply of Bitcoins will be capped at 21 million — or so the protocols say. This ensures that the “value” is democratically determined by supply and demand.
But, in reality, it is clear that the value of Bitcoin can fluctuate wildly, just like any other asset. Over the past two years, for example, Bitcoin’s value soared from $50 per Bitcoin (in 2012) to $1,150 (in late 2013), before collapsing this year to under $400, when a scandal erupted about the use of Bitcoin for money laundering. That makes Bitcoin arguably the worst-performing asset this year. Worse still, it is also clear that Bitcoin only works as a “currency” if people have rock-solid faith in their computers. After all, the risk of having electronic ledgers as the store of value is that the money could disappear if hackers broke into the system. Indeed, it can disappear if you just lose your electronic “key”, ie passcode. (And there are cases of that happening when people have accidentally wiped their hard drive, say, or lost their records.)
 . . . 
Of course, a cynic might argue that this same point about cyber risk also applies to modern global finance and many other aspects of the business world. And they do not appear to be stopping Bitcoin’s expansion, even into emerging markets. Never mind Bali bars; last week Microsoft announced it would accept Bitcoin for some accounts. Groups such as Dell, Expedia, Zynga, Virgin Galactic, PayPal and Atomic Mail have started accepting it too. Greenpeace and Wikimedia accept it for donations, and some US political candidates have declared they would accept Bitcoin campaign finance.
The more the Bitcoin revolution spreads, the more it reveals both the perils and power of innovation. The cyber technology that now ties our world together has made us dependent on potentially fragile cyber links. But it has also shrunk the globe, delivered extraordinary convenience and is making us all think afresh. Even my banker friend Mats. These days, he says he is (healthily) wary of Bitcoin. But he has nevertheless acquired a wallet of the cryptocurrency to bring with him back to Europe, as a travel souvenir-cum-modern equivalent of a gold bar. It might yet make some useful Christmas presents — and Santa might spin in his (electronic) sack.

Except for a half dozen or so hellholes, minimum wage is above a dollar a day everywhere.  If you are subsistence farmer, though, you may not have any cash income, or very little.
In any case, off-chain solutions can lower the transaction cost.  What's the tipping fee here on reddit? zero.  What's the transaction fee on Second Life (which has had a convertible virtual currency for ten years)? zero.  Database entries are so cheap you don't have to charge for them.  Both of the examples charge a fee when you cash out, but not when you make individual transactions.
Also, remember that if someone is using bitcoin at all, they have access to at least a phone that can do SMS, if not a smartphone or full computer.  So the subsistence farmer who can't afford twelve cents won't be using bitcoin in the first place, not by themselves.  They might have a balance kept by the merchant they sell some produce to, as an alternative to local fiat.  Evidence of their balance could be a simple paper receipt.

The public key is only revealed when you sign an outgoing transaction (it's used to verify the signature signed with the private key).  You can send bitcoins to a fresh address (never used before) without revealing the public key.  However remote the chance, the public and private keys are mathematically linked.  If a problem is discovered in the ECDSA algorithm, it is safer not to have revealed the public key.  
Addresses are shorter (160 bits vs 256 bits) and have a checksum built in, which reduces the chance you accidentally send to an invalid address.
For other reasons why we have an address vs public key, you will have to ask someone who knows more about cryptography than I do.

As a very large example, the Port Authority of NY and NJ operates bridges, tunnels, and airports [quite profitably]( - see chart on page 11.  They also operate other stuff at a loss, principally the World Trade Center, because it is under construction and not yet generating a lot of rental income.  The Port Authority does not have the ability to tax.  They finance large capital projects by borrowing up front, then collecting revenue (tolls, fees, rent, etc.)  This is not unlike putting up a large office building.  The developer borrows money to build it, then collects rent to pay for it afterwards.


It's likely a network of wireless toll collection would develop, the way we have ATM networks all over the place.  You have to remember that most highways are paid for today via fuel taxes and vehicle registration, and local roads are paid for by property taxes.  Tolls or subscriptions (if you live somewhere, it makes sense to pay annually for your local road use) would just shift how it would be paid.

In the US, courthouse records offices, where deeds and mortgages are filed, work purely off of fees.  A block-chain records system can also function purely off of fees, collected from people who need secure distributed record-keeping.  Likely people to start up nodes in such a system are notaries and county clerks, who already collect fees for stamping documents.
Other nodes who don't collect fees directly from customers would collect them indirectly from the nodes who provide paid record-keeping.

Each node checks the new transaction is valid, including looking at the block chain and memory pool to see if there was enough balance to make the transaction.  Depending how busy the node is, and how fast the hardware is, this might take a few seconds.  Faster nodes can process a new transaction in fractions of a second.
Propagation time will depend on how many hops the new transaction needs to cross the whole P2P network, and the speed of the connections between nodes.  Some nodes, like blockchain.info, are connected to many other nodes (815 when I looked just now).  BitcoinQt connects to 8 nodes typically.
According to  there are about 100,000 nodes, thus average number of hops would be about 5.5

There is a finite limit to the number of transactions that *need* to be stored.  You only need to keep transactions with unspent outputs in active storage.  Old addresses that have been emptied can go to archival solutions.  Assume 10 unspent outputs for every human on the planet.  That gives us 80 billion transactions to be stored n 2020.  Average transaction size is 400 bytes.  Thus 32 Terabytes.  That's feasible for a single desktop PC these days, and certainly for a server-class machine.
For archival storage, assume every person on Earth makes 1 transaction per day, thus 1168 Terabytes/year (400 bytes x 8 billion people x 365/year).  That will require a bit more than two Quantum Scalar i80 tape libraries @ 500 TB each.  A server + two tape libraries would take up about 1/4 of a standard equipment rack - for everyone on Earth.  That's not a very big deal, and assumes no improvement in storage over the next six years.
This is bigger than the average home user can handle, but in terms of data center capacity, it's pretty minor.  Just split up the cost between 100 people, and it becomes fairly cheap.

The time for random people mining bitcoins on a PC ended around mid- to late-2013 when "application specific integrated circuit" (ASIC) chips started to be used in volume.
"Mining" is the process of finding a hash (checksum) for a block of new transactions.  Each block also includes the hash result from the previous block, so blocks are chained together in order.  Hashes are intentionally hard to find, so it takes work to fake a transaction.  To insert a fake transaction you also have to find a matching hash for the block it's in.  For older blocks, you have to find matching hashes for every block after it.
A transaction history you can't mess with is essential to a financial network.  Therefore we reward the people who do the work of finding hashes (i.e. miners) with fresh bitcoins for each block they complete.  The difficulty of finding hashes is automatically adjusted so new blocks are completed every 10 minutes on average.  Since mid-2013 the difficulty has grown from 20 million to 40 billion.  So with the same hardware, you would earn 2000 times less coins now.  The value of 1 bitcoin has gone up by 4 times in the same period, so the overall return is 500 times less.
The reason for the huge increase is that ASICs are custom chips designed to do only one thing - the calculations for hashes.  They are by far the most efficient way to do it.  "Mining farms" also optimize labor and electricity costs.  Unless you have up-to-date ASICs and cheap electricity, you really can't compete.


The point of bitcoins was to be electronic cash that is easy to move anywhere, without a central organization like a bank.  Mining was just a way to distribute the coins fairly (whoever did the work, got some coins) and to be an incentive to make the transaction records secure.  If your goal is to make money without working hard, that time has passed for bitcoin.  If you care about privacy and avoiding bank fees and inflation, then bitcoin may have a point for you.

That's the theory.  However in practice, many governments run deficits and run up big debts.  Like any other debtor, they benefit when the value of the currency decreases, because it makes it cheaper to repay the debt.  Therefore there is pressure to devalue the currency.  This is not a new feature of fiat currency, it happened with precious metal coinage too.
Although the US Dollar has been better than most as far as rate of devaluation, there is still collusion between the banking system and the government to keep the rate above zero (and convince the population that it's a good thing to do so).  The government gets to reduce the value of it's massive debt in real terms.  People are encouraged to borrow more, because they too can repay with cheaper dollars.  Thus mortgages and corporate bonds are used more than they otherwise would.  This makes more business for the bankers, and credit ratings become an instrument of power of the bankers over the peons.
There are many worse examples of high or runaway devaluation: India, Argentina, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe to name a few.  [One study]( found a strong correlation of low inflation and monetary depth with income fairness as measured by the Gini coefficient.

Oil fields are mostly privately owned, or at least drilling rights are private.  The commons here is the *atmosphere*, into which the waste products from consuming oil and other fossil fuels end up.  Fossil fuel companies make a profit at the expense of everyone else in the world who has to suffer the consequences of increased CO2, particulate and stream pollution (from coal mostly), etc.  This is a classic tragedy of the commons situation.

Estimated offshore *financial* assets is $20-30 trillion:
That does not include non-financial assets like real estate.  Offshore in this context doesn't mean physical location so much as using chains of ownership by legal entities in different countries.  For example, the Pritzker family has used trusts and an offshore bank they own to shift funds so they don't pay taxes on it, but many of the Hyatt hotels are physically in the US:
Offshoring either disguises ownership or exploits national boundaries and legal differences to frustrate the tax collectors.  As a tool to move money around, bitcoin may find uses in offshoring, but I don't expect the people who use this tactic to hold a lot of it.  They are generally conservative in wanting to protect their wealth, not speculate with it.
Annual offshore flows are in the range of $1-1.5 trillion per year.  Assuming 1% of that flow is in bitcoins, we have $10-15 billion/year in bitcoin flows.  If the average holding time is the same as for other bitcoin holders (60 days), that flow turns over 6 times a year, so at any given moment there is demand for $1.5-3 billion.
If 1% of *assets* were placed in bitcoin, which I think is high given it's unstable pricing, that would amount to $200-300 billion.  I think bitcoin would need to mature into a stable asset class comparable to collectible art or yachts before rich people store much of their wealth in it.  That's quite a different use than as a transactional currency or treating it like a tech investment (betting on adoption of the technology by *other* people).

I used to do business in Second Life, so I can speak to the circumstances there.  For other games or game companies I would need to know more about the details in order to comment.
Second Life Linden Dollars are the in-world currency, and they are convertible on their exchange to US dollars, and can be cashed out (in fact, I used to be a major trader on that exchange, among other things in that world).  However, the owners of Second Life (Linden Lab) reserve the right to terminate your account for any reason or no reason.  This is a very common clause in online game terms of service.
Because of that, you don't have a *right* to keep your Second Life assets or internal money.  Therefore activity within their world does not fall under securities law (or tax law, for that matter).  This is unlike a corporate bond or stock share, which comes with certain rights you can enforce in a court.
When I calculate my income and expenses from Second Life, I record cash-outs to PayPal at the time they reach my PayPal account, because at that point Linden Lab can't arbitrarily terminate my account and keep the money.  It's now under my control.
For those other game companies you mention, it would depend on their terms of service (which is part of the contract between the company and the players), the rights you have in assets and game money, and whether you can profit from them by withdrawing cash, selling assets, etc.
99% of the assets in Second Life are created by users such as myself, and another part of the terms of service state that I retain intellectual property rights in the things I create.  Lots of people sell the things they make to other users, for game money, then later cash it out.  So in that world, it is legal to profit off your work.  Other games may prohibit selling items or characters. It happens anyway, but you don't have the right to make a profit, so it does not meet one of conditions needed for a security.

I'm sure people said the same thing about drilling for oil on the North Slope of Alaska, or three miles underwater in the Gulf of Mexico.  Let me give you a short course based on my 35 years in space industry:
Worldwide, space industry is a [$320 billion market](  Most space hardware becomes useless when it either runs out of fuel, or a key part breaks and we have no way to repair it.  The exception is the International Space Station (ISS), because it has a full time crew who can do maintenance, and gets regular deliveries of supplies, including fuel to maintain orbit.  
It would be worth billions a year if you had a service station in synchronous orbit, where all the comsats operate, but we don't because (a) anything above the low orbit the ISS lives in requires lots of fuel to get there, and (b) you are not protected from radiation at higher orbits.
Some types of asteroids contain up to 20% water, which can be used as fuel and also to keep humans alive.  The other 80% can be used as radiation shielding by wrapping it around the crew modules.  Precious metals are more common in asteroids than on Earth, but we are still talking parts per million.  It will be a long time before we are able to process enough asteroid rock to make a wedding ring, much less a bullion bar.  
The early money is when you can use 100% of asteroid rock to supply a satellite fueling and maintenance depot.  Other uses beyond that will develop over time.

I'll give you an example.  We had models who chatted online with guests, and offered photos starting as little as $0.25 for one photo (more for sets, lots more for custom pics).  A quarter dollar is too small even for bitcoin to be clogging up the block chain with micro-transactions.  You want to aggregate them into larger amounts.  Our method had guests buy blocks of tokens they could spend with the models, then later the models could cash out whenever they wanted.
(By the way, the photos themselves are not what guests are paying for, you can find infinite numbers of them online.  It's the chance to chat directly with the models.  It's the same reason people pay significant money for a celebrity photo signed in person.)

Chill out.  Yeah, the rules are ridiculous.  In theory the IRS wants to tax kids who run a lemonade stand or mow lawns, and every yard sale or transaction on Craigslist.  But in practice, they almost never do, because they are under-staffed and simply don't have time to chase small amounts.
I used to go to medieval fairs on a regular basis.  If the fair was small and mobile, the merchants got away without being taxed (state sales, or income).  If it's big and the same place every year (100 merchants, thousands of visitors), they have to file taxes, because usually the state sales tax person will come and visit them when they get that big.
An estimated 20% of the US Gross Domestic Product is in the "Underground" economy.  Most of that is legal activity that is just "off the books" - anything from contractors who get paid in cash, farmer's markets, family members working in a restaurant, etc.  Almost everyone ignores state use taxes. If you buy out of state and don't pay sales tax, in theory you owe your local state a use tax.
It's up to you how much detail you use when you report your taxes.  If you move your coins to an offline cold wallet, how is the IRS going to tell the difference between that and you selling them on localbitcoins for cash?  What happens when the first country makes them legal tender (perhaps the island of Alderney)?

Bitcoin uses "public key cryptography".  That involves creating a private and public key pair that are mathematically related.  A bitcoin address is derived from the public key by following a particular algorithm which is very hard to reverse.
You digitally sign a transaction using your private key.  The bitcoin software validates the transaction using the public key and address, without ever having to reveal the private key.  You can publish an address to take incoming funds without ever giving out the public key either.  If every time you spend out of an address, you send the leftovers (change) to a fresh address, your funds will always be held at addresses that have never published either public or private keys.  That makes them very secure.
Bitcoin "wallets" store and manage the keys so you don't have to deal with them directly, just the addresses.  The addresses have a checksum built in to guard against computer or human errors.  So you can check if an address is valid just from the address, without any other information.

Yes it is. I will use one of my own transactions as an example:
The first item on the right, in the amount of 3 BTC is coins I sent to a cold storage wallet.  The second item (0.01 BTC) is leftover change being sent back to my hot wallet at a new address.  Each of the inputs to the transaction, listed on the left, are coming from my hot wallet, all but one from my main address (1Hfxy...).  There are multiple inputs listed coming from the same address, but each traces to a previous transaction, which you can look up by clicking the "output" link on any of the inputs.
Therefore you can tell when each portion of the outgoing coins were acquired.  If you keep track of your cost with software (I use a spreadsheet), it is then not difficult to calculate the basis for coins you spend.
As an aside, all those tiny amounts are coming from bitcoin "faucets", and tips here on reddit.  I have no idea how to treat those, but my guess is since I got those for "free", their basis is zero.

"Free" is never the operative word when it comes to regulations.  There will be compliance overhead to deal with.  An existing brokerage, of which there are many in New York, already is saddled with regulatory overhead. It will likely it will cost them less to comply with whatever rules are set up in New York, because they already have the systems and reports in place.
  
However new start-ups will not have all that stuff in place, and the compliance costs will be large relative to their existing business.  So effectively the regulations will protect incumbent brokers and exchanges.

We are social animals, and inherited leader selection from before there were humans.  Back then it was things like posturing and intimidation that determined the alpha male.  Killing your rivals was not the usual method, because fights to the death had a high risk to yourself, and in a social troupe of 20-100 members, your rivals are likely related to you.  Killing relatives is a genetic handicap.
The legal system discourages death and intimidation as business tactics (gangs and government however do use them).  That pretty much leaves posturing as our inheritance in corporate social situations.  Since technical knowledge and ability are too recent a development to have been genetically selected for, the question becomes how much is posturing allowed to overcome them.
Even a big bank needs staff who can do math and program computers to perform the basic accounting functions, and lots of other people with specific skills.  So you need *some* people who are competent, or a big corporation will collapse in chaos.  It's the middle and upper management, who don't directly do day-to-day tasks, where incompetence and ignorance coupled to good social posturing can survive.  Such people at the core business functions leads to bad loans and trading losses in the case of a bank, and they tend to go out of business.  Similarly at any other business, if they can't do the basic functions, they go bankrupt.
I think the great advantage of small businesses and newer tech companies, like Google is that they have less incompetence.  A small business doesn't have room for people who don't know what they are doing.  Newer tech companies are still run by the founders, who had to have been competent, and tend to have a culture that values ability more than beating your chest and grunting (posturing).  Older tech companies, however, can become infected by incompetence and die.

Americans are not oblivious to the IRS, and they are pretty much universally hated, but how you try to reduce your taxes depends on your situation.  
I will use myself as an example.  When I was working for Boeing, there wasn't much I could do about that primary income.  I maxed out my 401K and contributed to an IRA, but Boeing was going to report my income to the IRS, and therefore it had to appear on my tax return.
What I did is buy rental property and have a small business on the side.  That lets me take some legitimate deductions and reduce my tax bill.  Trying to make my assets seizure-proof, or avoid taxes altogether, would be more work than the risk reduction or savings were worth.
Someone who runs a full time business, is wealthy, or is a big corporation, has larger tax bills to offset.  So the effort to safeguard their assets or avoid taxes is worth more.  There are whole industries set up to help them - private banking departments, tax attorneys, offshore havens.  I'm sure some of those people are figuring out ways to use bitcoin to reduce their taxes.  But for the rest of us, you would have to show how bitcoin is better than whatever we are already doing.

There are any number of bitcoin startups that have raised funding, but are not listed on the venture scanner site.  That's because not all of them publicly announce their fundraising (called "stealth mode") and others use angel investors or personal funds and just don't get recorded on that site.  So the total invested in bitcoin companies is comfortably larger than making that bomb of a movie.

Normally the contract would be first, specifying what "consideration" is to given in exchange for the land.  In this case it would read something like "In consideration of $50,000 US dollars worth of bitcoins, valued at the Coinbase exchange rate at the time of closing, paid to address X, I hereby agree to sell, and buyer Bob agrees to buy the following real property...."
Both sides sign the contract first, then you go through whatever the process is in Indonesia to execute the contract.  In the US it is called "closing the sale", and a third party (often a lawyer) provides the legal paperwork, verifies the funds have been transferred, then records the deed at the courthouse.  You will probably be more familiar with the legal process in Indonesia since you already bought land there.
But the principle is straightforward.  First you make the agreement, with suitable terms (the contract of sale), then you execute the contract with suitable safeguards on both sides for proof of payment and delivery of ownership.

Note the vertical scale is logarithmic, not linear, the exchange rate increased 100x from ~$6/BTC to $600/BTC over 3 years.  Past increases are not a prediction for the future, though.
The exchange rate is set by supply and demand.  The number of bitcoins increases slowly, while demand to use them in paying for stuff or holding as an asset for the future has increased rapidly.  Therefore the price has gone up.  Since the price is now rather high for a full bitcoin, we are in the process of converting to "Bits", which are 1 micro-bitcoin, to avoid fractions.  Thus the current rate is about 1613 Bits per US Dollar, or 15.9 Bits per Japanese Yen.

Think of subscribing to a legal system like buying an insurance policy.  You can choose not to subscribe, but then your protection is up to you, no help from the system.
There is no requirement to have a single legal system in an area any more than there has to be a single insurance company.  In fact, historically, multiple legal systems have operated in a given territory (roman citizens vs provincials, civil vs canon law in the middle ages), and it happens today in the US (federal, state and local law) and the EU (Union-wide and national laws).
Dealing with multiple jurisdictions happens all the time in today's legal systems.  The only change would be not tying jurisdiction to a particular piece of land.

I can't speak to Lawsky's motives, but the fact is the financial industry represents half the income of Manhattan, and the multiplier effect (i.e. stock analyst buys lunch at a restaurant, restaurant buys food from wholesaler, etc.) means the total impact on the economy is three times that.

Gah, I gave up reading this paper when there were about half a dozen errors in explaining how bitcoin works.  But I will make this critique:
Early on he states:


It is true that traditionally these functions are conjoined in one currency, but there is no logical requirement that they be in the future.  Bitcoin is an excellent medium of exchange because it is fully electronic and distributed worldwide.  However it is not required to be a unit of account.  Software enables easy conversion of prices from existing units of account like the US Dollar.  We are not quite there in terms of instantly converting bitcoins to Dollars, but that is an implementation issue, not a fundamental one.
Lastly, bitcoin was not designed to be a long term store of value.  Since the number of bitcoins is limited, their value will necessarily fluctuate with demand against other goods.  In this respect it is similar to other finite goods like real estate or gold, who also fluctuate against fiat currencies.  As long as there is easy conversion to whatever someone chooses as a store of value, it is not required that bitcoin also perform that function.
The assumption that Morgan's analyst makes is a common one: "It's been this way in the past, therefore it must always be this way in the future."  As history shows, though, that assumption is a mistake.  Things change.  The chained hash record-keeping system used in the Block Chain can also be used to track ownership rights to assets.  Those assets can then perform the store of value function, and user software can make it easy to make ownership transactions using bitcoin as the exchange medium.  If one of those assets is a fiat currency like dollars, you can also have the unit of account function.
Thus software can aggregate these functions so you have the effect of traditional money, but without forcing the components to do things they were not designed to do.

The details about what products we want to make and what starter set is required to get there is discussed in our half-finished [Wikibook](
The short version is our first generation design is aimed at satisfying basic needs for food, shelter, and utilities.  Thus items like a robot farm tractor and automated greenhouse are needed, and we need a path from a core starter set of machines to get to them.


Well, it's easier when you know how.  You start from a design requirement, like "provide 85% of the food, shelter, and utilities needs for a community of 200 people".  The reason for 85% and not 100% is because, for example, some foods don't grow well in a particular area, so you just buy them.  In a second or later generation design you might go to a higher level.
From the food requirement you can calculate land area and greenhouse size, and from that determine tractor size and materials to build the greenhouse.  Eventually you work back to how big the castings are for the tractor, and the solar furnace needed to melt the steel for the castings, etc.  The solar furnace requires it's own set of parts (mirrors, structural support), and you just keep working backwards until all the machines and the parts needed for them are accounted for.  This is tedious, but not terribly complicated.  Eventually you arrive at a starter set of machines, and specialty parts and materials you can't easily make and therefore buy.  Now you go forwards instead of backwards to actually make all the things you just designed.

What I'm working on is "distributed automated production", aka the "MakerNet".  A 3D printer can't make every kind of product, but a network of different machines can make all the different kinds of parts, and robots can assemble them.
Digital design files describe what to make, and get sent out across the network to the various machines, along with escrowed payment in a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin.  As each part of the work gets completed, the payment gets released, until the finished item gets delivered.
Such a production process can eliminate big swaths of business overhead - accounting, billing, inventory, etc.  If the design files describe the automated production machines, then network is also self-expanding.  The idea still needs lots of work, but more info can be found at:

This was solved in the business world since ancient times.  They are called [surety bonds]( - where a third party guarantees against the failure to perform a contract.  In an online bitcoin market, a new seller purchases such a bond to guarantee to customers the delivery of the product, or a refund in case of failure up to the amount of the bond.  A fee is collected for providing the bond, based on the risk level of the seller.  In effect you are using the reputation of the third party, which is presumably better than the new seller's, to support the seller until they build their own reputation.

Because Marc is wrong about this.  Anybody can look at the Block Chain and verify how much balance each address has.  Linking that address to an owner requires additional information not contained in the block chain itself.
An intelligence agency that collects lots of additional information can potentially match bitcoin transactions to people.  Coinbase knows how many coins I have bought through them, and what address I sent it to.  But if I later trade them for cash in person, it's not obvious that I did that, vs just move the coins to another wallet I control.  And if someone takes additional measures for privacy, tracking the flow of money can become very difficult.  If I hand over a USB drive with some number of bitcoins in a wallet on it in exchange for cash, there is no transaction on the block chain to track.

The Second Life virtual world had to deal with this problem.  They have a convertible internal currency, which can be sold and cashed out to PayPal.  So in theory someone can take a stolen card number, buy lots of "Linden Dollars", transfer them to a confederate or alternate account, then cash them out.
What they have done for years is to (a) have a limit on how much you can buy the first month, (b) monitor for unusually large internal transactions, and (c) delay cash outs by a week.  All of that allows time for the legitimate card-holder (or their card company) to notice something is wrong.  Even so, Second Life is often flagged by the card companies as suspicious, probably because of the number of fraud complaints.  The card holder then gets a call, or has to call in, to verify it is a legitimate charge.

First, it operated for 28 months.  Second, the prosecutor inflated the value of Silk Road sales.  He stated: " These figures are equivalent to roughly $1.2 billion in revenue and $79.8 million in commissions, **at current Bitcoin exchange rates**...", according to the September 2013 complaint"
Note the "at current exchange rates".  The Silk Road operated from Feb 2011 to Jun 2013.  The price of one coin was anywhere from about $1 to $10 in this period, except for the last 4 months, when it averaged about 100.  At the time of the indictment it was around $125.  So the true sales volume was vastly inflated by using the much higher price.
Another way to calculate the impact of the Silk Road is to divide the 9.5 million coins claimed to be transacted by 28 months of operation, giving 11,300 coins/day.  Total bitcoin transaction volume over the same period averaged about 1 million coins per day.  Thus the Silk Road represented ~1%.  The prosecutor doesn't explain where the 9.5 million number comes from, whether pure sales, transaction inputs including change, or double counting escrow movements and mixer operations.  So at best this is a rough estimate.

Actually, if you are a serious student of the history of technology, you will find that they didn't: 
The so-called Dark Ages were called that because of a lack of documents, not because it was a time of evil or a lack of sunlight.  However, modern archaeology has illuminated this formerly dark period using methods other than old manuscripts.
The reason we lacked documents is the period between 400 and 1000 AD was marked by repeated invasions into Western Europe, disrupting the kind of orderly society that keeps records and passes them down.  However, other areas outside Western Europe were not disrupted as much, and served as sources of knowledge once the invasions died down.  Internally, the base of society, which was always farming, made major improvements like the heavy plow, stirrup, horse collar, horseshoes, large scale use of iron, and improved crop rotation.

By combining data from the Silk Road indictment and the block chain, you can demonstrate that it never represented more than 4% of all transactions during the time it operated, which is about the percentage of drug trade worldwide to gross world product.
The dollar amount of trade claimed by the prosecutors is inflated because the total coins transacted on the Silk Road are valued at the market price at the time of seizure, which is much higher than the average price over the 2.5 year life of the marketplace.

The "Block Chain" is the history of every bitcoin transaction.  A block is a set of transactions whose contents have been secured with special hash value (checksum).  Each block also includes the hash from the previous block as part of the contents.  If you attempt to alter the contents of a block (change the amount of a transaction, or add a new one) it will no longer match the hash recorded in the next block, and it will be obvious you made a change.  Since all the blocks are linked in this way, we call it a "chain". Anyone can check the integrity of the history by hashing each block and comparing it to the value in the next block.
The standard version of the bitcoin software (bitcoinqt) downloads a copy of the block chain from other nodes on the bitcoin peer-to-peer network.  This is rather slow.  The torrent is an alternate way to download the data, and can be much faster if there are lots of "seeders" for the torrent (people with full copies).  It also makes the block chain portable, you can burn it to disk or put it on a USB drive.
This torrent only goes up to block 279,000.  Since the bitcoin network creates new blocks about every ten minutes, you still need to download the newest ones separately, but this method can get new users up and running faster.

This is incorrect.  The Block Chain method of chained hashes plus proof of work can record and verify any kind of digital data whatsoever.

A Seed Factory is a starter kit of machines that can make more machines to expand itself, plus useful products.  Whether they are bolted to each other or bolted to the floor is a design detail.
However, "a machine" is defined by the ability to do a useful operation.  Half a machine can't do anything useful.  Your bolted together Frankenstein machine could be separated into component machines, and they each still would do things.
Since we already have names for collections of machines, namely workshops and factories (the latter are larger), it does no service to misname such a collection as "a machine".

I guess you have never heard of good will, brand value, or intellectual property.  All of those regularly show up on corporate books.  In the case of the Bitcoin Network, the value is in the network nodes, mining hardware, 5 million user wallets, 65,000 businesses accepting it, software and apps, and the integrity of the transaction database.  All of that makes the Network useful, and demand to use the network gives the accounting token (bitcoin as a unit, vs a Network) a market value.
This is somewhat like the relationship of corporate assets and their stock price.  The assets are put to productive use, and have an underlying value based on their usefulness.  The stock price can fluctuate based on daily supply and demand, but tend to do so somewhere near the underlying value.  The same happens with bitcoin, there is an underlying value, and a market price that fluctuates.

The peak price only represents one trade on one exchange, and not the experience of the majority of bitcoin owners.  I haven't lost anything simply because I have not sold any coins, and the ones I have were mostly obtained before last November.
A natural time period to measure market gains and losses is when transaction volume = total coins in circulation.  In other words this is when the average bitcoin has been sold once.  Obviously some coins have never been sold, and others circulated many times, but an average of one time seems like a reasonable measure for "general experience of gains and losses".
Using estimated transaction volume from Blockchain.info I get a rough turnover time of ~60 days (I'm not smart enough to play with API's and get an exact number).

Most mining happens in pools or "mining farms" (large collection of mining hardware in one place).  Transaction fees are worth about $6000/day currently, so snagging a share of that with your mining power is worth something.
The larger pools and farms will make an effort to be "well connected" to the bitcoin network (have more than the default 8 connections to other nodes), to get incoming transactions faster, and spread completed blocks faster.  So the effect of a larger block taking longer to propagate is reduced.
The amount of transactions in the block being hashed has no effect on hashing speed.  What you actually hash is the "Merkle Root" of the transactions, which is a constant size.  You find that root once, then try a bazillion hashes (depends on your mining hardware) until the next transaction arrives.  Average time between transactions is ~1.2 seconds, and total network hashing power is ~40,000 trillion hashes in that time period.  So a given mining operation does a lot of hashes before it needs to update the Merkle Root.

There are things like colored coins and "side chains" which represent ownership of an asset, tied to the bitcoin block chain, or some other secure block chain.
A block chain is a very good record-keeping system.  Bitcoin uses it to store monetary transactions, but you can use it to store any kind of digital data whatsoever, including records of stock certificates or currency trades.  Such systems are not yet fully developed, but there is every expectation they will be.
Note that the financial industry currently uses the [Depository Trust Company]( to perform this service.  Paper stock certificates don't move around any more.  The DTC holds them, and transfers ownership electronically between brokers.  It has the same kind of problem being opaque and centralized as do bank account records.
@_date: 2014-08-29 05:45:16
That is not how I see it.  For me, Coinbase is a bridge from fiat to BTC.  I can buy coins via ACH from my checking account.  I always send the coins to my own wallet as soon as Coinbase delivers them.  
For now, most merchants convert back to fiat, but that is better than no merchants at all that we had two years ago.  Once the suppliers to the merchants also start taking bitcoin, the merchants won't have to convert back.  Employees are suppliers of labor, and if they take pay in BTC, then you have a closed ecosystem, and don't need Coinbase any more.
But that ecosystem can't be built in a day.  The first step is drawing merchants away from bank cards by offering lower fees.  The merchants themselves will figure out that paying suppliers in BTC will eliminate the remaining fees, and will push for it by self-interest.
@_date: 2014-01-12 14:52:09
That, sir, is an impossibility.  You can minimize it, but not eliminate it as long as human nature is what it is today:
People are self-interested, and interested in their family and friends.  This motivates them to work hard and help their friends.  But when you put people in a position of power, those same motivations cause taking bribes, nepotism, and other problems.  Those with the ability to make the rules will also tend to make them in favor of keeping and increasing their power and wealth.  To see this in action, observe the many "people's revolutions" which have ended up with a military dictatorship, who proceed to line their own pockets.
The best you can do is to minimize centralized power, and put in features that take account of self-interest.  For example, you could install cameras, GPS, and phone taps on politicians as a condition of holding office, and post the data publicly.  They have to be completely open about their affairs because of the tendency to corruption.  If they don't like it, don't go into politics.
This, of course, is the exact opposite of what happens today.  They watch us, not we watch them.  But is there any question in your mind that would lead to a less corrupt system?

I call this the "deflation fallacy".  Most people have needs that are more immediate than the deflation time horizon.  I'm hungry now, I need to pay my rent on the 1st of the month, etc.  They are going to spend that money soon, because they have to.

You seemed to have trouble understanding the quoted "fade out of existence" phrase, so I gave an explanation of how it can happen.  Whether Mt.Gox had such epically bad backup policies for a wallet worth hundreds of millions of dollars, I can't say, but they have been known to be poor business managers and programmers.
I like to build things in the workshop, so if it was me, and I had something that valuable, I would engrave the private keys on a stainless steel plate, weld another plate over it, clean up the edges, then engrave something pretty on the visible face.  Now the private keys are buried in a metal sandwich, and can only be read by an X-ray or ultrasound.  It's not obvious there is anything stored there (unlike a USB drive, say), and a stainless steel plate in a bank vault is pretty impervious to damage.  
But that's just me.

Text analysis by itself is not as conclusive as text + coding style + idea history.
Nick Szabo and Hal Finney have a published history of working on related topics, including the most direct precursors to bitcoin (Bit Gold and "proof-of-work").  Most new ideas don't pop up out of nothing, they develop over time.  They are the logical candidates to have developed bitcoin.
Also, "Satoshi" may be a composite entity, if multiple people contributed to it.  Thus trying to tie the identity to one person may prove fruitless, since it was not one person in that case.

If the cycle time from paying for the chips and parts to getting paid for the finished miners is, say 1 month, and you make 20% profit on the sale, that's a 20% return *per month*.  Depending on the situation of mining for coins, that may be a higher return.
If the cycle time is *negative* (pre-orders deliver payment before you pay for the chips), and you sell them at a profit, the rate of return is *infinite*, because you never use your own money at all.
So there are situations where selling them is a better return than mining.

I have a theory that might fit the facts:
Dorian Nakamoto appears to have worked on unknown classified projects in the 2000's.  He may have been part of a team that developed bitcoin, but not the "front man" who posted on forums.  The reason his family doesn't know is he was not allowed to talk about it.  The reason forum posts abruptly stopped when Gavin Andresen said he was going to talk to the CIA is the front man *was* CIA, or worked with/for them.  The reason they used "Satoshi Nakamoto" as the name on the paper and in the forum was plausible deniability.  They didn't know if and when something would tie the work to a person, so better to put it off on an individual than the full team or project funders.
I have no additional evidence beyond what's already circulating on and this theory may very well be totally wrong, but I thought it worth throwing out there in case someone else can refute it or improve on it.

We have used hashes for error checking for a long time, without monetary incentives.  The incentive is to reliably transfer a file without corruption.  For example, a .torrent file includes a series of hashes, one for each piece of the content files, but the hashes are not linked.
A block chain uses a series of linked hashes.  This is useful when the content files are growing rather than static.  An example might be registering identities of smart devices on a network.  As more devices get registered, you extend the chain.  If the content isn't valuable in itself, you may not need high difficulty proof of work and monetary incentives.

My understanding is this is pretty normal for the Japanese legal system.  Slow and they want to be very sure before accusing anyone.  Culturally "loss of face" is important to them, and making a wrong accusation would cause loss of face.  So they keep the investigation private, and only announce criminal indictments once they think there is a very high chance of conviction.
The fact that bitcoin is technically complicated and new to the police and lawyers doesn't help make it go any faster.  Neither does having lots of customers in other countries.

While the Gingery books are fun, they are perhaps a bit too low on the technology scale.  I'm also planning to build a workshop, but at the level of computerized machines.  I'm also moving to the Atlanta area so I can work with the "Makerspace/hackerspace" community that's already there.  It's hard for one person to afford or make all the equipment needed to replicate itself.  It's not so hard with a group of people who have multiple machines between them.
My hope is to grow a "MakerNet" among a distributed group of people, that can make an increasing amount of the stuff they need for each other.  Such a community can exist within a metropolitan area in parallel with holding existing jobs, so the transition can be gradual.
The only reason to confine it to a metropolitan area is transporting food and building materials starts to get expensive if it has to travel far.  Design files and specialized parts can travel farther at reasonable cost, so people can trade across more distant regions.

Actually, the hash rate won't keep rising too much longer.  The price increase since the end of 2012 has been about 30x, ASICs are about 100x more efficient than GPU's, and big mining farms may squeeze about 4x on wholesale electricity vs retail.  That's a total gain of 12,000x.  
Difficulty has already increased by about 12,000x since the end of 2012.  So mining profitability hasn't improved over GPUs at the end of 2012.  In the not so distant future it won't be profitable even for the most efficient mining farms, so rational miners will stop adding hardware.
Beyond that, we will have a halving of the block reward in ~1.85 years, so marginally profitable hardware will suddenly be 50% loss hardware.  Any hardware bought going forward has a very short operating life to earn back its cost.

I'll tell you about mine, as an example:
I'm working on automated production of physical goods.  Assume you want to have something made which requires a variety of suppliers, all of whom participate in a "Distributed Production Network".  You post the computer design (CAD) files to the network, along with a digital signature for a bitcoin address with enough funds to pay for it.
By some yet to built software, you negotiate and select the various suppliers, some of which will be sending items to each other to complete the project.  Once everything is arranged, you send payments from your "proof I have enough funds" address, to the suppliers as an escrowed transaction.  As each one finishes their part of the work, the payments are released to them, until you get final delivery.  For routine products, all of this can be more or less automated.
For the suppliers, they don't have to wait to get paid, or worry you won't pay for the work.  On your side as a customer, the record of who finished the work on time vs late, or had other problems can be recorded to a reputation score, backed up by block chain data.  So when choosing suppliers you can see "Ahh, this guy finishes 99% of his jobs on time", and also what kind of work they did and how much was charged is recorded publicly.  So you have much better data to work from.

He *could*, but there is no particular reason to exclude low or zero fee transactions yet, and mining pools and farms can harm their reputation by being assholes.
Blocks have a 1 MB maximum size set in the software, and current transaction rates only use about 20% of that, so you can fit all the transactions you get as a miner, even the zero fee ones, into the block.
Once transaction rates grow larger than whatever maximum block size is allowed, then there will be an incentive to drop zero/low fee transactions, and fees will end up being set by supply and demand.  There will be X slots per block available, and people wanting to make a transaction will have to bid enough fee to get one of them.
In turn, if the fees go high enough, a market will develop for "bulk transactions", where people collect lots of small transactions into single large ones to go on the block chain.

Every node in the Bitcoin network validates incoming transactions as they arrive, before passing them on.  That includes checking the balance on the sending address, to make sure there was enough funds in it.  If the transaction passes all the tests, it goes in the "memory pool", and gets sent to other nodes.
Another transaction trying to spend the same funds will fail, because the one in the memory pool came in first.  The failed transaction will not get passed on to other nodes.  Checking an arriving transaction and passing it on takes a matter of seconds.  So if you see the transaction arrive at several different locations on the network, and no other competing transaction shows up in the next 10-20 seconds, you are 99% or so sure it will be confirmed in a block.
If the value of the transaction is like a pizza delivery, that should be good enough.  If you are buying a car, the rest of the paperwork will take more than a few minutes.  So by the time all that is done, it will be confirmed by new blocks.

That is not foolproof, though.  The polling place register is in sequential order, and the ballots are tallied in the order inserted into the machine.

You can then reconstruct which ballots belong to whom from the register and order of ballots in the box.

Previously, they could buy bitcoins for their own account on another exchange, and resell them to their customers for a profit.  Currently it would work the other way - buy cheap coins from their customers, and resell on another exchange.  It doesn't matter which way the price is different, merely that there is a difference between exchanges and that they are in a unique position to do arbitrage.

This is poor logic.  Back in the early days I didn't care about profit, because I was mining on a graphics card I already owned, in the background of a PC I was already using.  The electric bill was negligible, in fact in the winter it helped keep this room warm.
As mining hardware becomes unprofitable, it will get sold off for parts by the mining farms, and eventually end up in the hands of people like me.  We would run it for fun, or to keep the network strong.  Thus it becomes more distributed.  The farms will sell the hardware because getting a little cash for it is better than just destroying it.  Besides, some altcoins might use the same mining algorithm, and people would want to use it for that too.
Lastly, businesses who depend on bitcoin may want to run their own small farms to help secure the network.  If bitcoin fails, their business fails.  So it is a form of insurance.

Localbitcoins has high overhead because they don't have other business to spread the cost over.  A convenience store that already is set up to sell phone cards and all sorts of other goods will have much lower overhead for a bitcoin transaction.

I think of "a bitcoin" as a unit of measure, like "a meter".  What it measures is the size of transactions and unspent balances.  As a unit of measurement, it has no physical existence.  Only entries in the block chain exist, in the same sense a sentence in a novel exists.  That sentence is embodied in multiple copies of the book, but you can uniquely reference it, just like you can uniquely reference bitcoin transactions despite there being many copies of the block chain.

Ahh, OK, I did not realize that.  Dooglus is not quoting total return as its understood by most investors then.
Also, despite what he thinks, he's issuing securities as the Securities and Exchange Commission would see them.  First of all, he calls people who contribute funds "investors", which is a red flag.  Second, "Securities" are a right to profit from the work of others, in this case him.  Lending bitcoins and returning a variable interest rate is no different than corporate bonds with a variable rate.  His operation would not be classed as a partnership, because as far as I can tell, his investors have no meaningful participation in the operation of the business, they only contribute money.
I hope he has made his situation SEC-proof, as the only thing that prevents them from going after him is they are extraordinarily slow.  I should know, I'm in a class action stemming from mortgage-backed securities fraud in 2007, and the case still isn't finished.

I suggest you read up on the subject more before throwing around numbers like $100k/ounce.
The calculations for a mining ship are in [my book]( so I won't repeat the details here.  
With an empty mass of 10 tons, plus 23 tons of fuel, it can bring back 1000 tons of rock.  Since you can extract 200 tons of fuel out of the 1000 tons of rock, later trips don't require more from Earth.  One ship can be expected to make ~7 trips before replacement, so total mass return is 7000 tons.
The [Falcon 9]( can deliver 13 tons to orbit, so two flights can transport the mining ship and a partial fuel load.  The first trip would bring back a reduced cargo, after that it would be fully fueled.
The market value of 1200 net tons of fuel in high orbit, at $2000/kg, is $2.4 billion.  The mining ship and processing plant, based on similar space hardware, should run about $600 million each, and two Falcon 9 launches are $125 million.  That leaves a comfortable profit margin.
If you try an extract precious metals, you would get 7000 tons x 0.1% concentration = 7 tons, with a market value of  ~$1000/oz average = $30k/kg = $30M/ton.  That nets $210 million, which is not enough to cover costs.  Thus mining precious metals with current technology isn't a good idea.

That's a more limited fix, but easier to implement than to get rid of the SEC entirely.  Most of what the SEC does (registration statements, prospectuses, filing periodic reports) is require companies to provide public information, so that investors have something to judge the risks with.

Similarly, the block chain has units of "one bitcoin" and fractions thereof.  It's how we measure transactions and balances.  Without a unit, the entries in a ledger are just numbers.  They could represent hours worked, tons of coal, or anything else.  But to know which, some unit of measure has to be defined.

So what he says about bitcoin to us and to the general media is to gain political support.

I did work on space elevator concepts when I was at Boeing's space systems division.  It's written up in [Section 4.10]( of the textbook I put online.
To put it in terms a bitcoiner will understand, the pictures you usually see of a single cable connected to the Earth are a centralized single point of failure.  A safer engineering design is a distributed network of multiple cables connected to each other.  One way to connect them is by orbital mechanics rather than ultra-long cables.  A series of smaller elevators that relay payloads is much cheaper than one big one.
Although I think they will be very useful in the future, the truth is the world only launched 32 payloads last year to higher orbits.  A space elevator of any type is transportation infrastructure, like a bridge or airport.  You don't build those for 32 trips a year, they are just not economic, and neither is an elevator.  You either have to wait until there is more traffic, or start very small and build up to larger elevators over time.  Research and prototypes is fine, and is happening today.  It takes time to develop a new technology.

Apparently Karpeles never learned how to balance a checkbook (the simplest kind of accounting that pretty much everyone knows how to do).
@_date: 2014-07-19 17:21:10


Neither.  At its heart, Bitcoin is an accounting ledger that records transactions from one address to another.  The private keys and hashes and software are how you ensure the integrity of the ledger and control who can make transactions, but they are not essential to what it is.  You could operate such a ledger by hand, very slowly, that does the same basic functions.
The units in the accounting ledger are also called "bitcoins" (or bits or satoshi).  Having the same name leads to confusion, but we are stuck with it for now.  Those units can't move out of the ledger, only between addresses. The Bitcoin ledger isn't a security.  It is not a claim on an asset or earnings.  A bitcoin address with non-zero balance is an asset.  People are willing to trade other things for that balance.  
Shares of the Winklevoss Trust are a claim on the balances of some addresses.  They are not the asset itself, they just point to it.  That is what makes them a security.  In the same way, a manufacturing company has buildings and machinery as assets.  Shares of stock in the company are claims on those assets, but not the asset itself.  Thus they are securities.

Bitcoin is a threat to their protection racket by removing the need for centralized banks and brokers.  They will therefore have nothing to extort fines from.  They need to stop bitcoin and things like it to keep the money coming in to their department.

Bitcoin transactions are recorded in "blocks" of one or more transactions per block.  Each block is secured against changes, intentional or accidental, by a check sum calculated from the contents.  This is called a "hash value", or hash for short.  This hash value is included in the contents of the next block, which in turn is secured by the next hash after it.  Since each block is linked to the previous one by including the previous hash, they are all linked in a chain, and hence why we call it a block chain.
Chaining them does two things.  First, it provides many and ongoing check sums, each depending on the previous one.  You can validate the contents of every block by re-hashing it and comparing to the value saved in the next block.  Second, since the blocks are in time sequence, you can follow the history of transactions in order.  Each full node checks the balance of the sending addresses by adding up all the previous transactions in and out of that address.  Therefore it can prove the next transaction using that address had enough balance to send.  Since every node checks every transaction and keeps its own copy of the block chain, it is highly redundant.
When a new node joins the network, it starts from the very first block, and checks the whole 20 GB of transactions to make sure they are correct.  Thus corruption can't be passed on, because no node accepts the word of another source, it checks the data itself.

A large new solar power plant project is coming in at $2.33/Watt installed (  ).  That location gets 2,375 hours/year of sunlight, so each installed Watt produces 2.375 kWh, worth about $0.14 at *wholesale* electric rates (much lower than residential retail rates).  Thus it generates a return of 6.1% before any subsidies, power purchase agreements, or any other financial fiddling.

It goes back farther than the US dollar.  The Spanish silver dollar was worth 8 "Reals", which is why pirates and others referred to them as "pieces of eight".  They were sometimes cut into smaller pieces of 4, 2, or 1 real, creating half, quarter, and eighth dollars.  The first US dollars were set to the average silver weight of the Spanish currency, since it was the dominant currency in the Americas.  The slang for the 1 real unit, whether it's own coin or 1/8 of a silver dollar became "one bit" of a US dollar.
Spanish currency was legal tender until about 1848, because the US government was poor, and it took a long time to mint enough of it's own coins.  The US system used dimes (latin for tenths) as the smallest silver coin.  So once the real or cut spanish dollars went out of common use, the reference to bits as a monetary unit gradually went out of use.

In a full economy, money circulates from buyer to merchant to supplier to employees as a generally accepted medium of exchange.
You don't build such an economy all at once.  Coinbase is helping by taking the exchange rate risk out for merchants, increasing their acceptance, and by providing an easy route for individuals to get their hands on some coins.  That's a start.  The rest of it (merchant to supplier, and business to employee) will need to grow over time.  
There are places for other bitcoin services to step in and make those things easier.  For example, a merchant who needs to pay a supplier in another country often has currency hassles and wire fees.  So a service that specializes in international payments and uses bitcoin internally for transfers could undercut the banks and other legacy networks.

* Private security firms exist even with police forces at work in the same areas.  This shows that the marginal benefit of such security is greater than the cost.  If we remove police forces, presumably the marginal benefit would go up, because the crime currently handled by the police would no longer be handled.  Thus other nearby neighborhoods would have an incentive to hire their own private security, providing a rough balance.
Note that "private security" can be the same people who do police work now.  Just instead of having a monopoly over a given territory, they would have to compete to serve a given region at the subdivision or home-owner's association level
* It does not make sense to have competing fire departments in a given area.  What does make sense is for insurance companies offering fire insurance to fund local local fire stations, because it saves them on damage claims.  Multiple competing insurance companies can fund a given station according to their client base.  Unlike government-funded fire departments, the insurers have an incentive to make the fire stations effective and efficient, because it saves them money.
* Private road building happens all the time by real estate developers, because of exactly the reason you claimed - it increases the value of the adjoining property more than the cost of the road.  If you wanted to do it on a larger scale than a shopping center or residential subdivision, the road builder can offer to build the road in return for a claim on the adjoining properties when they are sold.  If the value of the road is greater than the claims, the property owners would presumably accept the deal.
To give you an example from real life, I used to live on rural property, and the old wooden bridge at the bottom of the hill was destroyed when a logging truck weighing about four times the load limit (40 ton truck, 11 ton bridge) tried to cross it.  The county was going to build a new concrete bridge, but to bring it up to current standards they needed some right of way on my property to straighten and widen the road, and 2000 yards of fill dirt to raise the elevation of the roadbed to meet the new bridge.
I was happy to do that because a better bridge improved my property value, and the fill dirt they took out of my land created a new flat area that could be built on.  Any company seeking to build a new road between two disconnected points needs to get right of way for the road construction, and they would be foolish not to also buy some of the adjoining property that ends up having road frontage.  They can then sell the adjoining land at a profit.
* I work at home doing engineering and design.  I don't see a lot of people except when I go food shopping once a week.  I therefore don't get a flu shot, because I am not very likely to be exposed or transmit the disease in the event I catch it.  Forced vaccination before you can attend school is needed because schools are excellent ways to spread disease - they bring together large numbers of unrelated people, who then go home to transmit the germs.  In other words, you are solving a problem they created.
But if you want to capture the externalities of vaccination, then perhaps a frequent flyer discount for shots could be set up, since frequent travelers are the ones carrying diseases around the world and sharing them in airplane cabins and airport terminals.  I have not though this one through, but there should be a connection between the people causing the epidemics and the cost of prevention.

Time for an ACH transfer request to be posted to your bank account is usually next day.  Time for the transfer to clear at the *other* bank is 3-5 business days:
ACH stands for "Automated Clearing House".  A clearing house is where paper checks used to be sorted between incoming and outgoing batches from different banks.  At the end of the day, the net difference for a banks that owed had to be wired to the Federal Reserve, and then the Fed redistributes the net differences back to the banks that had a positive net.  That's "clearing", all the day's checks are now paid in terms of money transfers among the banks.
There's more than one clearing house.  I worked for one of the big New York banks at their check clearing center in lower Manhattan when I was in college.  This was a block from the actual clearing house, and other banks had their processing in nearby buildings.  Everyone shipped batches of checks with adding machine tapes and other paperwork around in boxes and trucks, through the clearing house, in and out of the bank's own processing center, and then out to all the branches.  If the check has far to go, it needed to get on a truck or plane to a different clearing house.
The "Automated Clearing House" reproduces this whole system in it's mindless complexity because banks don't know how else to settle up with each other.  Clearing is still through the Fed in daily totals, made up of batches of transactions. There are 12 Fed district banks, and each has a clearing house, plus some commercial clearing houses.  Those clearing houses also have to settle up with each other for payments going from one to the other because of where the customer's banks are.  That also happens once a day.  So the process is:
My bank to local clearing house = 1 day.  Local clearing house settlement = 1 day.  Clearing house to other bank = 1 day = 3 days total.  If it has to go from one clearing house to another, add a day or two, depending on distance.  That's where the 3-5 days comes from.
Banks couldn't shift instantly from paper to all-electronic.  Paper checks still flow through the system today.  So they are stuck with this slow system.  Bitcoin is all electronic from the start, and only has one giant ledger to mark transfers from one user address directly to another.  There aren't all those middlemen that run on daily payment cycles.  So we can "clear" (6 confirmations) in about an hour or so, even for big transactions

What I expect is businesses that depend on bitcoin, and individuals who hold a lot of it, will run dedicated nodes, or subscribe to them.  I have room to host a 20 GB block chain on my home PC, but when it gets to terabytes that becomes impractical.  So you end up with server-grade nodes with lots of storage and bandwidth, for which I would be happy to pay $10 a month or whatever to access along with a bunch of other subscribers.  Maybe it's run by my local credit union, or maybe it's at a web hosting company.  That doesn't matter as long as there are enough nodes to ensure the integrity of the block chain.

Analysis points to Nick Szabo and probably Hal Finney as the creators of bitcoin.  Analysis of the original Satoshi paper shows many similarities in writing style (phrases, punctuation) to Szabo's published work.
Szabo proposed ["bit gold"]( in 2005.  The blog was post-dated to make it appear it had a later date, but the URL indicates it was first posted in 2005.  When you read the proposal, it is obviously a precursor to bitcoin.  Szabo has written [a lot]( on related topics.
Hal Finney created the "proof of work" system used in bitcoin.  He was the second person to mine bitcoins, only a day after it went live, and the first person to receive a transaction, from Satoshi.  This makes sense if he was a co-developer.  He has been very active in cryptography (he's one of the developers of PGP) for many years, including writing about "digital cash".
Another hint is that in Japanese the family name comes first. NS is the initials for both bitcoins creator and Nick Szabo.  Not proof, but a hint.
Szabo and/or Finney have much better links to the creation of bitcoin from their previous work than Dorian.

Hashing is computing a checksum from a block of source data.  If the data changes, so would the hash, so you can check the integrity of the original data by comparing it to the original hash value.  In bitcoin, the "activity" is a block of data composed of [a set of new transactions + hash of previous block + a random number].  By recalculating the hash of a block and comparing it to the value stored in the next block, you can verify the data is correct.  Since each block is linked to the next one by it's hash, we call the entire set of all bitcoin transactions the "Block Chain".  Because they are linked in order, we have a history of transactions in sequence.
The random number is used to meet an additional condition, that the hash is near zero.  For example, a recent block (293384) has the hash value of:
Since hashes vary pseudo-randomly when you change the input block, the only way to find a hash with all those leading zeroes is to try lots of random numbers.  The bitcoin software adjusts what value you need to be below every 2016 blocks (about two weeks), so that the whole network together finds one block every 10 minutes on average.  Since finding blocks is hard, faking a block (putting in fake transactions) is also hard.  As long as the majority of miners are honest, they will find legitimate blocks faster than dishonest miners.  The longest chain of blocks represents the most computing power put into finding it (proof of work), and is accepted as the legitimate history of transactions.  
Once a bunch of blocks are added after a given transaction, changing the data (dishonestly or via data corruption) invalidates all the hashes in all the following blocks, because they are linked.  So over time the security of the block chain data increases.


Bitcoin "mining" is the process of looking for new block hashes by varying the random number in the block data.  All miners are working in parallel, and whoever finds a sufficiently low hash value first wins the race.  Then everyone starts looking for the *next* block hash.  The first transaction in every block is a special coin generation one.  This transaction has no inputs, but the outputs (currently 25 BTC) go to the miner's own address.  Since the output is greater than the input, the total number of coins go up.
Mining makes the history of bitcoin transaction data secure, which is critical for a payment system.  New coins are the main reward at present for doing this important work (transaction fees will take over in the future).  In simple terms we are rewarding the "accountants" writing the digital ledger of transactions by letting them make an entry for themselves.


I'm afraid I can't read inscrutable oriental minds, so I cannot tell you exactly.  But government actions typically come from a few main sources:  the desire to help their citizens somehow, corruption and influence on government officials, or a threat to government power (and hence their own jobs).  Money is a source of government power - by creating it and taxing it they control a share of a nation's economic output.  By controlling how it is used, they can make people do or avoid doing things.  Competition for a national currency can therefore be seen as a threat to their power.
Governments need to maintain legitimacy, or at least acquiescence, in the eyes of their citizens, lest they be overthrown and lose power and the income stream from corruption.  So they typically give reasons to explain their actions.  However, an opaque government can lie about their reasons when the true ones (like filling their pockets with bribes) are not seen as legitimate.  We have to use judgement and experience in assessing whether any given reason is true or a lie.

What they probably mean is accounts at overseas exchanges or brokers, denominated in bitcoins.  This kind of reporting comes from secret Swiss bank accounts originally, which would be denominated in Swiss Francs I assume.
ETA: I assume the IRS position is they don't care if it's a fiat or cryptocurrency, if it's in a foreign account and large amount, they want to know about it.  How this blends with their declaring bitcoin as property, I'm not sure.  Let's say you hold the private keys to some bitcoins in a vault in a tax haven country.  Is that property or a financial account?
If you control the keys to your bitcoins yourself, it's not foreign.

This was a "sealed bid" auction, which is typical of government agencies (i've bought Army surplus items that way).  Everyone fills out a bid form and puts down a deposit, traditionally in a sealed envelope, but these days probably electronically.
At the appointed time, the government opens the bids, and informs whoever bid highest that they won.  Other bidders don't get to find out the winning bid or anything else but that they lost.
It's up to the winner to announce that they won, and the price, if they want.  Or they could keep quiet.  When the coins move, we can see it on the block chain.
Price action is indeterminate.  If it brought in new buyers because the Marshall's Service is a less dodgy seller than some of the alternatives, it will not depress the price.

88% of US dollars only exist as an entry in a computerized bank ledger too.  Banks don't hold vast sums of cash in their vaults equal to all their deposit balances.  The difference with bitcoin is the ledger is massively redundant (there are many copies) and each "page" (block) has a checksum (hash) that requires the whole network to produce.  Everyone running the software can and does verify the validity of all past transactions on their own.  So it is nearly impossible to mess with the entries.  
By comparison, a bank ledger only requires one insider to tamper with it, and they therefore require multiple layers of auditors and book-balancing to prevent that.  There is a lot of cost overhead for that constant rechecking.


Yes, private and public keys, which are created in pairs, and an address generated from the public key via a one-way process.  You only need to reveal the address to receive funds, and the public key to make transactions.  The private key is used to digitally sign transactions, but doesn't have to ever be revealed.
A wallet is just a file containing one or more key pairs, preferably secured by encryption.  Since new addresses have never revealed their public key, and addresses are trivial to create, privacy and security is greater if you use new ones for each transaction.  A computer file makes managing the details easier, but you can write down or print out the private key (a paper wallet) to guard against hardware failure or hacking.


They are based on keeping the private key private, since anyone with that key can send your bitcoins elsewhere.  The bigger the balance at a given address, the more care you want to take not to reveal the private key, and the more you want backups to guard against losing them.  Backups and security are somewhat opposed, but there are clever methods like "2 of 3 signature" addresses, where at least two of three (or higher numbers) are required to make a transaction.  You store the three pieces in different places, and the loss of any one piece does not prevent spending the balance.

That's not exactly true, in the US at least.  The Federal Reserve monetizes debt to add to the money supply.  They buy Treasury Bonds, or bad mortgages, and pay for them with dollars then backed by those same bonds and mortgages.  Paper dollars and metal coins are issued to individual banks when they deposit "suitable collateral" with the Fed.  The list of what is suitable is mostly what kinds of debt instruments can be used.  
Finally, by fractional reserve banking, money supply is increased when loans are made.  The borrower deposits his loan check at his bank, increasing his account balance.  But the depositors at the lending bank still show their same balances, even though the lending bank no longer has the funds (they were loaned out).  Rinse and repeat, and an original cash deposit gets multiplied 10-15 times by repeated loans across multiple banks.
If the US government and individual borrowers all paid back their loans, there would be nothing left to back the US dollar with, because aside from whatever gold is in Treasury vaults, it's all backed by debt.

First of all, sorry for the slow reply.  I'm in the middle of moving to Atlanta to start up a bitcoin-related project.
Second, you haven't addressed my suggestion.  Yes, if you arbitrarily increase block size by a factor of 100, fees will drop dramatically, because you outrun use of the network.  That analysis applies to one instant in time.
However, mining farms have an investment in equipment.  They would like to keep earning fees in the longer term.  If the block size grows at or less than demand to make transactions, and I suggest 19% per year is such a rate, TX fees will stay about the same, but there are more of them, so more fees.
If you never increase block size, TX fees will go up to the point off-chain or conventional banking will be cheaper.  That puts a cap on miner fees.  The rational answer from a miner's perspective is to keep fees low enough to attract users, and gradually expand the block size so as to earn more fees.
Overexpansion, as you point out, would kill fees.  What you want is a gradual transition as the block reward goes down, and fees take over as the main income source.

That's not the point.  Let's say you buy a smart appliance, like an heat pump, refrigerator, or washing machine.  It comes with a service contract.  A block chain can record an ownership token for the service contract.  If you sell the appliance, you can sign over the service contract to the next owner.  Your electric company may offer cheap rates at night for washing clothes.  The appliance can authenticate itself and claim the cheap rates.
Block chains are record-keeping systems, not communications systems.  They would substitute for filling out warranty registrations, transfers of ownership (like when you sell a house with appliances included), and similar paperwork.  They would also allow smart devices to authenticate themselves and negotiate services and payments on their own.

My suggestion is to double the max block size every time the mining reward halves.  Thus 2 MB in about two years, 4 MB in about 6 years, etc.  Larger blocks let miners earn more transaction fees to replace the declining rewards.  So they have an incentive to accept the change.  It's also a simple and predictable schedule that people can plan around, and it is not too drastic a growth rate (about 19% per year on average).

That's called "anecdotal evidence", which is not a valid method of reasoning.


Well, I would start by getting past the mental block that a monopoly is the only way to do things.  And in the US at least (I don't know where you live) we have competing hospitals, some of which are non-profit, so the operating model already exists.
From a legal standpoint, it would mean changing the system from compulsory monopoly based on territory to individual or local choice.  It's impractical to select road maintenance supplier at the individual home level in a subdivision, but it is entirely possible at the subdivision level, or street/road level outside a subdivision.  In the US, it is typically the city or county road department who does the maintenance, and you don't have any choice if they do a crappy job.  Extend that type of thinking to other services beyond roads.
Not every government department is lazy and inefficient, but a lot of them are.  Choice and competition is a mechanism to improve the results.  Dogmatic insistence that a monopoly is the only way to do things is just that - dogma, not reasoning based on actual data.

The longest branch on the block chain is the accepted history of bitcoin transactions.  Miners create new blocks out of recent transactions by finding a hash for them.  If you control 51% of the mining power, you can write the longest branch, and thus include fake transactions if you are evil.
The theory of bitcoin is that miners compete to write blocks in order to claim the reward, but since finding block hashes is random, nobody has control.  As long as there are more honest miners than evil miners, the honest ones win out in the long run.  That fails if one mining pool controls the majority of the mining power and turns evil.  It becomes a single point of failure.

With the current bitcoin architecture, you will inevitably be driven to dedicated servers hosted by businesses with an interest in bitcoin, and by subscribers paying for freestanding servers (at data centers).  The servers will aggregate small transactions into single larger ones to each other, and pass the details of the smaller amounts in off-chain messages.  This is still decentralized, but as 1000 servers instead of 100,000 home PC's.
The reason such a shift is inevitable is that the number of transactions grows linearly with the number of bitcoin users.  Therefore the size of the block chain also grows linearly with the number of users.  But the total data storage requirement grows as the **square** of the number of users.  Each user has a copy of the block chain x number of other users making transactions.
You need a way to linearize the problem.  If you have a number of servers equal to the square root of the number of users (1000 servers for 1 million users) and each server aggregates transactions from their square root subset of the user population (1000) users into 1 transaction, then block chain storage will grow linearly.

The trick is to avoid being defined as a "security" (where you make passive income via the work of others).  Mining pools where everyone directly mines isn't a passive activity.  For the automated factory I'm working on, it will be jointly owned by the members who contributed, and they get to decide what will be produced.
If you get into transferable shares and not needing to do work to earn an income, it falls under the legal definition of security, and then the US agencies claim jurisdiction.  In that case, the only answers I can see are:
(a) follow the rules they set up, or
(b) operate out of a location outside the US that doesn't give a shit about the SEC and FINRA.

Buffet got his big financial start with GEICO, an insurance company, so if he understands anything it's risk.  I think he gets into stuff when it has a favorable reward-to-risk ratio.  So railroads are low risk, and higher fuel prices favor them over trucks (because steel rails have lower friction than rubber tires).  Since you can't just jump in and build a new railroad the way you can jump in and build new software, it's protected.  If people want to use more rail, they will have to use the existing ones.  Any new lines, like the ones carrying northern oil, will almost certainly connect to and use existing lines, cause rail is a network.  So the risk is pretty low on that investment.
I don't think Buffet is a dummy, he's just not interested in things where there there isn't an edge or a fence protecting the business from competition.

You can use a chain of hashes to incrementally validate a database that gets added to all the time.  Examples are airline reservations or online sales.  This secures the data against accidental corruption or malicious tampering.  It solves the problem of "how do you know your backup tapes are still good?".  If the data is valuable enough, the technique may be worthwhile even for a single user.
If you want a distributed public database, then you need additional incentives, but the incentive doesn't have to be monetary.  The existence of [distributed computation projects]( and Wikipedia and other wikis demonstrates that.  To be sure, financial incentives are often more reliable than volunteers, but to say

It's like selling cars in Alabama.  You can sell a car privately no problem.  You sell more than five in a year (if I remember right), and you have to register as a car dealer, which comes with paperwork on your car sales.

Not hard to find:


BitPay of course is only one payment processor, and both BitPay and Coinbase doubled their merchant count in the past 4 months, so a full-year statistic for 2013 is highly skewed towards the end of the year.  It under-reports the current run rate, because the early part of the year had far fewer merchants.
I think a reasonable way to estimate Bitcoin's economy is to take 50% of estimated transaction volume, to account for people moving funds between their own wallets.  So far this year that is ~110,000 coins/day at an average price of $650 x 50% = $35.75 million/day = $13.05 billion/year.

In fact, the US Dollar was created to match the Spanish Silver Dollar that was already in circulation in the colonies at the time.  This can be proven by the fact that the Bill of Rights (7th amendment) mentions dollars, but the US Dollar was not created until the first coinage act that came *after* the Constitution was adopted.  In practice, the silver content for the US Dollar was determined by finding the average for a batch of Spanish Dollars.  That way they could circulate at parity.  
The Spanish Dollar was legal tender in the US until 1857.  It was necessary for it to be legal tender at first, until the US coinage had time to be produced and get into wide circulation.  Unlike fiat currency, silver coins require actual silver to produce, so you can't just print as many as you need like with paper.  The early US government didn't collect much in the way of taxes, so they didn't have much to work with in making new coins.

It's the Bitcoin Network that has tangible value and usefulness.  It enables moving money quickly and efficiently.  Demand to use the network in turn gives units in the ledger (lowecase bitcoins and satoshi) a value by supply and demand.  That's because you need some of the units to use the Bitcoin Network.
The network consists of hardware like mining ASICs, wallet software, websites, merchants that accept bitcoin, etc.  All those things have value in themselves, and don't need backing by anything else, but in combination they are more useful than the pieces by themselves.
You can say the same about the Internet.  Routers and fiber optic cables have value by themselves, but combine them with all the other stuff that makes the Internet and they have more value.

Well, over geological time spans, yes.  On human time scales, not so much.  There's ash fall record from the Yellowstone supervolcano that covers about 1/3 of the Unites States, but the frequency is about 600,000 years.  So the insurance rates should be pretty low.
Insuring against "acts of Nature" is quite reasonable almost everywhere.  There are few places safe from all the hazards of volcanoes, earthquakes, blizzards (they can collapse roofs), floods, hail, lightniing, hurricanes, or wildfires.
For example, I used to work at Boeing's Kent plant south of Seattle.  The reason the Green River valley, where the plant is, is flat is because it's filled with volcanic debris from Mt. Rainier, 70 miles away.  Whenever the volcano erupts, it melts the glaciers on the mountain, and that washes everything in it's path downhill.  The Green River starts on that mountain.

The thing is, bitcoin has a complete accounting ledger (the Block Chain) and you can identify exactly which coins are being spent, and where they came from in the previous transaction.  FIFO and LIFO are simple to calculate when you have a mass of indistinguishable shares of stock in a brokerage account.  However, the Block Chain enables you to identify "the fraction of a bitcoin I used to buy coffee today was acquired on 1 Mar 2014 in transaction X at price Y".
With downloadable CSV files and some spreadsheet work, or automating the whole process for tax recordkeeping in an app, you should be able to prove to the IRS what your gain is.
To put it another way, the Block Chain keeps receipts for every bitcoin transaction, it's a perfect record-keeping system.  All you need is a way to extract the data for your personal tax calculations.

File hashes have been used for quite a while to verify that a download was correct. That's fine for a single file.  However the Windows OS consists of many files, and is frequently updated.  You would like to know that the changes were applied in the right order, and the current state of your OS is correct.  
A chain of hashes imposes a time-order on the blocks of data.  In bitcoin we use that time order to prevent double-spending - the transaction that comes first gets the funds.  In an operating system (or other changing data), you use it to verify the sequence of updates and checksums (hashes) of the files.

If the bitcoin community submits a thousand comments, and nothing gets changed in the regulations, it exposes the process as a farce.  We can then say the regs were developed behind closed doors between DFS and the banking industry, and ignored the public.  
It provides raw material for a court case to stop enforcement: "These regs violate such and such laws, this was pointed out to them, and they did it anyway.  Therefore the regulation process is broken, and we need an injunction to halt them from enforcing the regs until they get fixed."
The point of a court case is not to win, it is to tie them up in court long enough for bitcoin to grow and become unstoppably large.

It's not a critical question, it's a nonsensical question.  Why would anyone mine for gold from the asteroids, when other precious metals in them have a lot more value, and bulk materials like fuel have even higher value than that?  Even if we wanted to extract the gold, current technology can't get it out.  Water and hydrocarbons for fuel can be extracted by simple heating to temperatures typical of a household oven (a few hundred degrees C).  Oven heating is easy, just use some mirrors to concentrate sunlight.
Precious metals, including gold, are mixed into chunks of asteroid steel in tiny quantities.  We don't know how to design an extraction process yet.  Without a process, nobody can answer the question about cost.

Even more trivia: The Spanish silver dollar was worth 8 reals, hence the term "pieces of eight" for pirate treasure.  The US dollar was sized to match the Spanish dollar, because it was the most widely circulated coin in the world at the time, including in the colonies.  Thus the 1 real coin, which also circulated, became equated to "one bit" of a dollar.
Spanish dollars were legal tender in the US until 1857, because it took that long for the US to mint enough domestic coins that they could stop using foreign coins.

You are not doing anything wrong.  The Income Tax taxes income, and your coins are not net income until you sell them.

If you live in the US, it gets reported on Schedule D of form 1040 for the tax year in which you sell them.
In the mean time, they are a capital asset, like a house, or collectibles.  Their value can go up and down in the mean time, but you don't owe taxes until they are sold at a gain.  I recommend reading up on the capital gains tax and how it works, so you will be prepared for when you decide to use your coins.  If it's a really large amount, get professional help.

If you run just a regular node, you typically have connections to 8 other nodes.  So your confidence in a given transaction is based on it being first to arrive to one of those nodes, then relayed to you.  If you look at blockchain.info (~600 nodes), Mycelium, or other well-connected node, you have a higher confidence, because you are sampling more of the network.  Some mining pools may also be well-connected because that would propagate their blocks faster and beat out other miners (I don't know if they actually are).
Even being included in a block isn't perfect confidence in a transaction, because another branch of the block chain may end up the longest.  So the way I view it is we have a confidence curve vs time.  Mycelium can help improve the confidence in the first minute, so that's a good thing.  But each person has to decide what confidence is acceptable for a given transaction, and how long to wait.
I'm not sure if Mycelium's method tracks competing spends of the same funds.  These would fail and not get propagated further by a given node, but the fact it exists is useful data.  No competing spends is better than if there are attempts on the network.  Another factor is transaction fee.  A higher fee increases the chances the transaction will get included in a block.  Along with percentage of nodes that have seen the transaction, you can estimate a combined confidence level that the transaction will end up permanently in the block chain.

A digital record is more portable, divisible, etc. compared to physical paper, and therefore a technical improvement.  
Prior to using chained hashes and distributed copies, digital data wasn't very tamper-proof.

L$ are convertible on exchanges to fiat currency, which made it popular with the adult providers, and the buyers only showed a purchase of game currency on their credit card.

It's more of a two step process.  New transactions get checked for validity, including seeing if there is enough balance in the sending addresses.  If valid, they get added to the "memory pool" of new transactions, and forwarded to other nodes.  The memory pool forms a "temporary ledger", because transactions already in it are part of the set being checked when another new transaction arrives.
Blocks are formed out of the memory pools of miners.  When broadcast and checked, the transactions contained in it are removed from a node's memory pool, and the block is added to the growing block chain.  At that point, the temporary order of transactions in the memory pool becomes the permanent order of transactions in the block chain.  But the temporary ledger/memory pool serves to prevent double spending immediately.  It doesn't just happen when blocks arrive.

Think of it as auto-refill or recharge for your wallet.  Whatever amount you spend at a merchant, you automatically buy back the same number of coins from Coinbase so your wallet isn't depleted.
The horizontal/vertical part is obscure.  Usually people talk about consumer-to-business vs business-to-business, and business supply chains.  Using bitcoin for business-to-business is taking off slower than consumer spending, because businesses use credit cards less for purchases, and therefore there are fewer card fees to eliminate.  
There are different overheads in traditional business purchasing - such as getting supplier quotes, issuing purchase orders, and then waiting to get paid. Bitcoin should be able to help squeeze out some of the overhead, but it will be different than integrating a shopping cart into a website.
My guess is the first business uses will come in international orders and payments, since those are the most difficult.

Because that is a stupid strawman either-or binary choice.  I'm happy to pay taxes when I get value for service, and they don't do immoral things with the money.  But in a monopoly taxation by force system (i.e what we have pretty much everywhere in the world) the taxing authorities don't have much incentive to be efficient, and you don't have much choice in what they do with the money.
The US system is theoretically representative, but in reality only well funded candidates can get elected, everyone who voted for the loser isn't represented at all, and once in office they can go against what they campaigned on.  Thus we end up with a situation where the majority of people disapprove of their own elected representative (  ) and the approval rating of congress as a whole is abysmal (15%).
"I will take my money elsewhere" is one of the few choices you have if you don't like how your local monopoly government is operated.

You have to remember that the original clearing house system, before computers, had to settle up bundles of physical checks between banks, so that the cancelled checks could be returned to the customers as proof of payment.  Daily clearings and a day to transfer between clearing houses entirely makes sense in that situation.
The other thing to realize is that *there are still paper checks in the system*.  Not everything is paid by debit card yet.  They talk about speeding up clearing, but that can't happen until every check is scanned on arrival (they can travel electronically afterwards), and every bank is ready to upgrade their systems to more frequent clearings, like hourly.
It's even worse when you consider international payments.  One summer in college I worked at a major New York bank's international check clearing operation (totaling up daily drug money transfers from South America, but that's another story).  The check clearing building was in lower Manhattan, physically very close to the clearing house the New York Fed had.  But the checks first had to get from South America to Manhattan, so that added extra time to the process.  How long do you think it will take for every bank in other countries to be ready for electronic clearing?

I'm afraid they have different meanings.  The first is "dishonest or fraudulent conduct by those in power, typically involving bribery.", while the second is interference in free trade by means like tariffs and quotas.  If the tariffs are the result of bribery, then they would be corrupt.  But they can be the result of legal but misguided laws.

They are different shades of meaning and scope:
* Money is anything accepted in trade as an intermediary, replacing the need to barter.  Barter requires a "coincidence of wants" - you want what I have, I want what you have.  Money makes trade easier because you only need to satisfy one want at a time.
* Currency is money commonly in use in a particular community.  Cigarettes may be money in prison, but they are not commonly in use in wider society, and thus not currency.
* Legal tender is money required to be accepted as payment.  A landlord may not accept credit cards, but they have to take dollars in the US when the rent is due.  Legal tender laws often cause particular money to become currency (ie widespread use), but mismanagement, like hyperinflation, can cause them to fall out of use in favor of other things (other currencies, or physical goods).

Mistaken amounts do happen with checks, but it is less than 1 in 1000 in my personal experience, and usually the bank corrects it themselves before the monthly statement.  In the case of Bank of America, they weren't going to return the excess payment until I asked for it back.


The lines at the power company, Comcast, and water company say different.  If everyone did paper mail or electronic payments, they wouldn't need multiple cashiers and ropes to line people up.  I do expect paper checks and people standing in line to go away eventually, but we are not there yet.  In fact, Comcast went backwards.

They can see the balance of the sending address both past and future, because the Block Chain is public.  However wallets can hold many addresses, so knowing the balance of one of them doesn't reveal which other addresses are in the same wallet or who owns it.  Moving a balance between your own addresses looks just like spending the coins to an outside observer.


Again, wallets hold multiple addresses.  Addresses are what send and get coins.  Everyone can see how much change a given transaction had, and what address it goes to, but only the person you sent bitcoins to knows which output address was change, and which was the payment to them.  Everyone else has to guess which is the real transaction, which was change, or if both were real spends or both just shuffling balances among addresses you control.
Transactions by themselves don't identify the owner, you can only infer the owner from additional information linked to the transaction.  It's considered good practice to always use a new address, and not send change back to the sending address, because then you know the coins are still under control of the same person.

Generally a good article.  A few points that need correction though:


Wallets hold the private and public key pairs, and the address associated with them, but they can hold multiple sets per wallet


The most common transactions today are simple payments, and those are irreversible as noted above.  But they do not have to be that way.  The bitcoin protocol allows for escrowed transactions and more complex programmed ones via scripts.  There are also third party escrow services.  Thus seller payment can be held until the buyer is satisfied, or disputes resolved.


This and the other detriments in that paragraph are no different than cash throughout history.  However, bitcoin has an advantage in being very difficult to counterfeit.  Since everyone has access to the complete history of every coin and fraction thereof, it is difficult to insert fake ones.

What it means is consumers have been paying off debt faster than they have been taking out new loans:
The money supply is mostly made of debt.  When you take out a car loan, the car dealer gets a check from the bank, which they deposit in their bank.  However the bank still shows the same balances for all the depositors.  Instead of vault cash,  the bank now has a loan on the books to balance the deposit liabilities.  The car dealer's bank, however, now has a deposit that wasn't there before.  Thus the total money in the system has gone up.
However, when loans are paid off faster than they are created, the opposite happens.  Total money supply in the system goes down.  Less money available relative to demand to spend it would normally mean the "cost of money" (interest rates) would go up.  The Fed has prevented this by "quantitative easing", otherwise known as creating money.  It buys up debt, and issues dollars in return, backed by that debt, thus increasing the money supply.
Since consumer debt has been declining at about $300 billion a year, and Fed money creation has been $1 trillion a year, the Fed wins, and overall money supply has increased.

1.  I don't mind talking about it, but unfortunately there are a lot of people in forums who use magical thinking and are pointless to discuss with.  Carbon intensity (the amount released into the atmosphere per unit of GDP) is already being lowered, and can be lowered further.  
For example, making cement for concrete accounts for 6% of global CO2 releases.  That's because concrete is the single most used solid product, cement making is very energy intensive, and mostly it is done with fossil fuels today.  However a solar furnace can heat the ingredients to the required temperature (1500 C, 2750 F) instead of fossil fuels, lowering the CO2 emissions.  
That's just one example, there are many others.  The transition to a low-carbon economy is something that will happen in the first half of this century if it's going to be of much use.  400 years in the future is far too late.
2.  Most technologies follow a [sigmoid]( curve individually.  Not many people work on it in the early days, so progress is slow.  Once it hits a level of usefulness, progress is much faster for a while, but then you run into some limit, like maximum possible efficiency.  Squeezing out the last bit of progress takes longer.
A good example is [infant mortality]( in this case for Scotland.  The various medical advances started having an effect in 1900.  The limit in this case is zero mortality, which they have reached better than 90% of the goal.  That last bit will take longer to reduce.

A distributed "Maker" network.  
Makers are people, and eventually automated machines, that make stuff.  That includes traditional fabrication, like woodworking and welding, and modern digital fabrication, like CNC routers and 3D printers.
Unless you have a very well equipped home workshop, or access to a "Makerspace" (community workshop), you often can't finish a project, because you don't have all the right equipment or skills.  A MakerNet lets people collaborate to finish projects that they can't do individually.  Where bitcoin comes in is as a payment method and savings vehicle.  
An example of the first is I help you build a garage and accumulate bitcoins, which I can later spend on something I need from others in the network.  The second would be network members building and accumulating ownership shares in more expensive items, that they can then use as needed.
From a software standpoint, we need a way for members to list their skills and tools, listing work needed and tracking bids/offers to supply the work (with multiple suppliers sometimes - a work party to put up a garage would need more than one helper), scheduling, tracking jointly owned/built items, escrowed funds, and sending digital files when you are feeding 3D printers and such.

I casually know about four people at Deep Space Industries, through my past work for Boeing's space systems division.  That means we met at conferences or exchanged papers and reports.  Nothing formal, but we have similar goals.
I currently work for myself, on [self-expanding factories](  The relevance is It's too heavy to haul entire mining operations into space.  You want to send a starter kit, and build the bulk of the equipment from the asteroid itself.  Fortunately the metallic-type asteroids are made of a decent iron-nickel alloy, so you can use it to build more machines pretty easily.
I'm also working on updating this [space systems]( wikibook, because mining isn't all you need for a functioning space economy.

Gold isn't the most prevalent precious metal in asteroidal materials.  See table 1 in this [article](  The article is old, so adjust metals prices to today.


As I mentioned in another comment for this article, [433 Eros]( is a stony (S-type) asteroid, which is the wrong kind.  You want one of the metallic asteroids, because the precious metals are associated with iron.  That's why they are rare on the Earth's surface, most of it sank to the core.
The rest of your question is irrelevant, because one of the other 12,000 and growing [Near Earth Asteroids]( is what you would go after, whichever has the best orbit and right composition.  We are finding over 1000 new ones a year, so there are plenty to choose from.
As far as radiation, grabbing a small asteroid (1000 tons or less) is an unmanned operation, so it doesn't matter.  You don't land on it.  You [sneak up on it]( with a giant trash bag and pull the drawstring.  
Item  depends on the physical characteristics of the asteroid.  If it's a high-metallic, like [this one ton meteorite]( from Australia, it's basically a solid chunk of steel, so it would be pretty easy to hold on to.  But you would want to prospect your candidates first, and see what kind of condition they are in.  Some combination of bag/box/net will work.


It delivers payloads to Low Earth Orbit.  The mining tug has it's own engines and fuel, and goes the rest of the distance itself, with a gravity assist from the Moon to help along the way.

Regulatory overhead, cost, and they don't trust each other.  
That same burdensome regulation that makes it difficult to set up an exchange in the US for us regular bitcoiners is just as much a burden for Wall Street professionals.  Doing it once for a joint exchange is cheaper than each of them doing it on their own.  That goes for the exchange software and network infrastructure too.

Bitcoin price up about 30x since the end of 2012.  ASIC efficiency up about 100x over GPU.  Mining farm gets wholesale electricity about 4x cheaper than typical retail user at home.  Combined gain is 30 x 100 x 4 = 12,000
Bitcoin difficulty has increased by ~12,000 times since the end of 2012 (34 billion now, vs 3 million then).  Therefore large mining farms are no more profitable today than GPUs were at the end of 2012.  
My Nvidia card was mining at a loss at that time, but it was winter and it helped keep the room warm, and I already had the card, so it was just electricity.  An AMD card at that time should have been making a modest profit.
A modern mining farm only has ~1.85 years to recover hardware cost before the next reward halving, and has to pay for electricity on top of that.  So I expect it to become a marginal proposition very soon or already.

Nope, Nick Szabo, possibly with help from Hal Finney, are more likely to have created bitcoin.  They have directly related experience, knew each other, and Finney was the second person to mine bitcoin (the day after it launched) and the first to be sent a transaction.  
Szabo had worked on something called "Bit Gold" several years before bitcoin was launched, and text analysis of Nakamoto's original paper about bitcoin shows a close match to Szabo's previous work.

Any economist who isn't a moron should predict it.  People save part of their money for future needs, and spend the larger part (usually) for current needs.  That includes rent, food, utilities, gas, and such.  Whether bitcoin is inflating or deflating makes no difference for current needs (spending within the current month or pay period), because the expected value change is too small.
If you are saving bitcoin for the future, your time scale is going to be longer than a year, because that's about how long it takes the secular rise to overcome short term fluctuations.  You then evaluate it against other high risk/high potential return investments.  In that case the rate of new coins being generated (12.5% annualized over the past month) factors into the supply vs demand estimates.

You are missing something.  A [bitcoin transaction]( only specifies the starting and ending addresses, and how many coins start and end at each.  How do you figure out ownership from that?  You can't tell if the output addresses are owned by the same or a different person, since a single bitcoin wallet can hold any number of addresses.
In order to tie identity to an address, you need information from outside the Block Chain (ledger).  For example, an online merchant who collects names and postal addresses for shipping has a good idea of who sent him bitcoins.  But addresses are single use by default (the unused balance gets sent to a new address).  They are not like credit card or checking account numbers that stay the same through many transactions.

The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation was founded in 1865 to finance the opium trade with China.  One of their original board members, Thomas Dent, had previously been importing opium illegally.  When the Chinese authorities tried to shut him down, it sparked the Opium Wars.  The British had superior weapons, and forced concessions from China, including opening up trade.  Originally the opium was coming from India, so the ships and cargo needed financing, which is where HSBC came in.
So when you hear news about HSBC laundering money for drug cartels, remember that they have been in that business for 150 years.

It also reduces risk of identity theft, because bitcoin addresses don't contain personal info, and are relatively disposable.  Unlike a credit card transaction, which has all the info required to make another credit card transaction, bitcoin private keys stay private.

@_date: 2014-01-06 19:12:40
Find a hash value &lt; (value set by current difficulty), where the data to be hashed is:
* Hash value of previous block +
* Set of new transactions, including one generate transaction for new coins +
* A random number that you vary until you get a low enough result
By including the hash of the previous block as part of the data of the current block, they form an ordered sequence, so that you can tell which transactions for a given address happened first.  This prevents spending the balance multiple times, only the first instance counts
The difficulty forces significant work to find a low enough hash value (proof of work).  If anyone tries to hack old transaction blocks (alter amounts, or add a spurious transaction), it would no longer match the hash value recorded in the next block.  That makes the hack obvious.  To make a change, you would have to find a corrected hash for the altered block *and every one after it*.  That requires repeating the same amount of work that went into creating all the later block hashes.
Since the difficulty is automatically adjusted so that the whole network finds one hash/10 minutes on average, there isn't enough spare computing power to redo the work.  The generate transaction includes a reward of 25 new bitcoins ( worth ~$23,000 at the moment) + you get any transaction fees included in the block.  This is an incentive for "miners" to work on new blocks rather than trying to alter old transactions, because an old block requires many times the work to edit than just creating a new one.
The result is we have a digital database of transactions which is practically impossible to ever edit.  The ongoing hashes serve as checksums every 10 minutes.  That is the great invention within bitcoin, and what makes it possible to use as a distributed payment network.  It's even more secure than a bank's accounts database, because an insider at the bank can theoretically hack it.
There are other security features (private key signing of transactions, many copies of the block chain, each validated separately by the client software, etc.)  but the un-alterable history of transactions is the key one.

US v. Park is about the CEO of a retail food market being prosecuted for violations of the Food and Drug Act.  They had rats in their warehouse.  The company pled guilty to the violations, but Park pled not guilty.  The Court held that Park as CEO was in a position of authority in the company, and could also be held individually responsible for the violations (he was fined).
That decision has nothing to do with financial liability, and everything to do with acts of a responsible individual.  In the case of Karpeles, if he is responsible for negligence in how Mt.Gox was operated, or committed actual fraud, I would expect him to suffer the consequences.

A currency is a subtype of money which is in actual use and circulation.  For example, the Japanese Yen is money in the US, but not a currency of the US because it is not in general use.  Bitcoin is not yet money in the full sense.  It is a medium of exchange, but not yet a full unit of account or store of value.  It is also not yet in general use and circulation anywhere.
Therefore it is closer to a commodity at the present time - a standardized good which is easily traded.  Over time it can evolve towards being money and currency as people start to measure the value of other goods in terms of it, the value stabilizes, and it starts to circulate in the general population.
For it to reach those levels of use, there needs to be a lot more total value of bitcoin.  For example, since you typically need to use the Internet to use bitcoin, we can treat the world's Internet users as the "country" that could adopt bitcoin.  If we choose 1% as a minimum level of general use and circulation, you can estimate a need for $110 billion in bitcoin money supply by comparing it to the volume of other currencies.  Given the number of bitcoin right now (12.6 million), that implies a price of $9,000/BTC.
We early adopters are speculating on the future level of adoption by everyone else.  Adoption has been increasing, and technical improvements are being made that improves bitcoin's features, but it has a way to go to reach currency status.  Besides personal investment performance, price is one of the measures of progress towards currency status.

As a victim of identity theft, I beg to differ.  I like a payment system that doesn't hand out all my personal info.  As someone who has had Bank of America take their automatic payment twice a few months ago (for no apparent reason), I like a user-initiated transaction system.  A number of merchants are offering discounts of 3% or more to use bitcoin, which is nice.


You are speaking from a position of privilege.  Half of US underprivileged households are unbanked or don't have full access to those payment options.  Underprivileged are low income, minority, single parent female, etc.  When you get outside the most developed nations, the people without good access goes beyond the underprivileged sector and is the majority.  Only the well off in those countries have full access.
The mistake a lot of people make is thinking everyone is like them, and because they don't see any advantage, there aren't any.  The reality is everyone has a different situation and different needs.  Bitcoin doesn't need everyone to use it to succeed. If ten percent of people worldwide used it, it would be the 4th largest currency.  It only has to be better than the worst 10% by GDP of other currencies to reach that level, which is a pretty low standard.

I just finished reading a book on the [history of political theory]( so yes, I think I do.
However, just because a group labels themselves a "Communist Party", does not mean they actually act like the label implies.  Communism is theoretically ownership of the means of production by the proletariat (workers), as a later stage of economic development than capitalism.  Capitalism is private ownership of the means of production for profit.
Given that China hosts three stock exchanges (Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Shenzen), and state owned enterprises now account for only a quarter of [industrial output]( I would describe them as "no longer communist", although they tried to be in the past.  Thus they contradict Marxist theory by moving in the other direction towards capitalism, despite the label they still have on their Central Committee.

Given the clues in Satoshi Nakamoto's name, I have a strong suspicion bitcoin was created by NSA cryptographers for this purpose, and as a way to fund clandestine operations.  Since governments around the world are clamping down on offshore tax evasion and money laundering to raise more taxes, that makes it harder for the CIA/NSA/whatever three letter agency to pay for clandestine stuff without being noticed.
Some of those outrageous cost overruns you hear about on government programs are the starting point for hidden funding.  The bottom line budget totals for the whole government have to add up, so the secret stuff gets buried under a cover project.

They don't claim to know how to make fusion work.  They have a theory of how they might make it work, if it scales the way the theory says.  To test the theory, they need to upgrade their equipment.
They have raised several million from private investors, but that doesn't go very far in fusion experiments.  The indiegogo campaign is to buy *one part* (a beryllium cathode) to upgrade their test setup.  The reason this part is so expensive, is berylium is a toxic metal, so machining it takes special precautions, and the electrode has to handle over a million amps of current.
The theory behind this fusion device is that the enormous current discharge generates a magnetic field that kinks up and momentarily creates a plasma ball with a high enough temperature and pressure to cause fusion.  Fusion happens any time you get a sufficient combination of temperature and pressure.  The Sun does it by simple gravity.  The Tokamak and Laser government fusion projects use magnetic fields and zapping a target respectively.  But those projects require big machines to make it happen.  The attraction of the LPP Focus Fusion approach is it would be a small device if it works.

It's not just computing that will be decentralized.  The project I'm working on is aimed at distributed physical production.  A few concepts:
* A "MakerNet" is a network of production nodes, where each node includes people with skills and some set of machines.  When someone wants something made, their order and payment goes across the network to selected nodes, who collaborate in the production steps.  As each step is completed, they get paid by something like escrowed bitcoins.  If the machines are sufficiently automated, the whole process can operate autonomously.
* A "Seed Factory" is a starter kit of core machines which can make parts for other machines, including expanding the factory itself.  As you add more machines to the core, you not only can make an increasing range of products, but eventually new starter sets.  Such a factory doesn't have to be under one roof and one owner.  It can be distributed as long as the various machines can communicate and are designed to work together.
The [Seed Factory Project]( is aimed at developing and testing MakerNets and Seed Factories.  We just bought a 2.67 acre R&amp;D location in Fairburn, GA (Atlanta metro). Unlike pure software development, which you can do with a laptop and internet connection, we need physical workshop space, tools, and materials.  So it is taking longer to get going.  We have both been crowd-funded by bitcoin, and intend to use it as the payment method in our projects, so we are fully a part of the community.
(I'm writing this on an ancient laptop, since our office PC's haven't been unpacked, and it will be a while until we renovate the workshop space and move in the tools.  I'll try to answer any questions, but as we are still moving in, I may be slow.)

When you were doing other things, like compiling a program, you could listen to the noise and tell when it was finished.  This was useful, because you could then go do other stuff in the mean time.  This computer even had a [10 MB hard drive](

Cognitive dissonance often leaves people confused.  That's when they know one thing from their teaching and prior experience, and now see something very different before their eyes.
The earliest example I know of is church officials refusing to admit what they saw in Galileo's telescope was real (satellites of Jupiter, phases of Venus), because it didn't fit their Aristotelian world view.  That was despite what their own eyes were showing them.
Copernicus waited until he was safely dead to publish his theories, Galileo was placed under house arrest, and Giordano Bruno, who correctly identified the Sun as just another star among many, and predicted there were many inhabited worlds, was burned at the stake.

Differences in tax rules means opportunity for "tax arbitrage" and offshoring.  Designing methods to save money this way is complicated, but so is writing software.
For example, the Pritzger family, who own the Hyatt hotel chain and other stuff, own an offshore bank.  The bank lends money to finance the hotels, so the hotel business can deduct the interest as an expense.  They pay less income tax.  The bank shows a profit, but it's in a tax haven country.  The family pays no tax on the bank, because it doesn't pay dividends to the shareholders.

I worked a summer job at Manufacturer's Hanover back around 1981, which after 4 mergers is now part of JP Morgan.  My job was totaling up deposits from correspondent banks in South America by country (with a desk calculator).  The daily totals went to higher management, so they knew how much was coming in from drug cartels.  When a tiny bank in a no-name town in Colombia makes single deposits on a regular basis of exactly $1 million each, it's pretty obvious what is going on.
But they have plausible denial because it went through the check processing clerks first, then to me to total up the dailies, then probably a middle manager for regional correspondent banks, before it went to senior management.  They can say "oh, we had no idea that was drug money", even though it should be obvious the size of the deposits was out of whack with the size of the town or region.
One reason HSBC got caught is their correspondent bank was HSBC Mexico, another part of their company, instead of an entirely separate local bank.
Correspondent banks have accounts at a bigger international bank in order to handle international transactions.  It doesn't pay for a local bank in one country to set up international offices everywhere, so they use the services of the larger banks.   The effect is to break the paperwork trail, because each country has different reporting rules, and a given investigator usually can't cross national borders.

The $20-40 billion figure is only from tax havens.  Nearly 20% of total US income is [not reported]( according to a 2011 study, leading to nearly $500 billion in uncollected taxes.  This "underground" economy (i.e not visible to the tax man) includes legal but unreported income, such as a contractor that works for cash and just doesn't record it.  That part is called "off the books".  The other part is illegal activity, such as drugs, prostitution, untaxed alcohol and tobacco, etc.  This part is called the "black market".
Using "tax havens" is one way to avoid reporting income altogether, as some countries just don't report to the IRS.  More complex but legal methods are "tax arbitrage", exploiting difference in tax rates between countries, and "offshoring", moving assets to another country.  Large corporations often do this and save billions.  For obvious reasons it is hard to measure the international component of tax avoidance/reduction, but the total amount of assets held offshore has been estimated as high as [$20 trillion](
The total bitcoin economy is tiny on these scales, but it can be an efficient method to move assets offshore.  First, it does not seem to fall under the "foreign account" reporting rules the IRS has set up recently.  Second, you can travel without carrying anything related to bitcoin, so there is nothing to seize at the border.  Once in another country, you can log in from your laptop or smartphone to an online account and pay for your offshore asset.  Alternately you can store a bitcoin wallet in something innocuous, like an SD card in your camera bag, then load it up once you arrive, or use encrypted cloud storage, or even a combination with partial keys.

The [Seed Factory Project]( which I am part of, is aimed at distributed automated production, which we call a "MakerNet".  Individuals are not likely to own all the machines to make all the stuff they want.  However they may own one or two, or shares in a few machines.  To do a complete project, you connect the locations with different machines electronically, and transmit the design files and payments as needed.  Bitcoin is perfectly suited for the payment part.  You can use escrowed transactions when you order something to be made, and release payment when they complete their work.

I'm working on an analysis of the regulations.  This is made more difficult because the proposed regulations don't reference their legal authority individually, they just generally reference multiple sections of NY state laws.
But to give you an example, open-source code (which is what most altcoins use) is regarded as "speech" in the constitutional sense of freedom of speech:
The proposed regulations prohibit "issuing a virtual currency" without a license.  Since creating an altcoin is a matter of writing and distributing copies of open source code, requiring a license is an unconstitutional restraint on free speech.


No they are not.  The regulations require keeping all earnings in dollar form.  Foreign banks doing business in New York, and there are a lot of them, because Wall Street, are not required to do that.  Logically, they convert earnings to their local currency (Pounds, Euro, etc.) in order to pay national taxes, or any other currency in order to re-invest the earnings in the form of new loans.

I don't know about physical locations of nodes.  They connect to each other via a peer-to-peer network.  In my experience, watching my own copy of BitcoinQt send and receive transactions, it's a matter of a few seconds.  Since my node connects to ~8 other nodes, even if one of them is busy and not relaying, the others will.
If you are using an online wallet, there may be a delay issuing a new transaction to the network.  That is a problem with the wallet website or app, not the bitcoin network itself.
Miners are network nodes like everyone else, and get transactions as they propagate across the network.  If they discover a new block hash, they then transmit the block across the network.  All the other nodes verify the block is valid, then add it to their block chain files.  They also remove any transactions from their "memory pool" which are part of that block.
The memory pool consists of recently arrived transactions which are not yet in a block.  That pool grows and shrinks constantly.  So a recently made transaction (say from an online wallet to my BitcoinQT wallet) can arrive very quickly, and sit in the memory pool until a block shows up that includes it.  On my client program it will show as zero confirmations at first, then increment as new blocks arrive.
The 5-10 minutes you are talking about is the typical time for a block to arrive, but the transaction itself can have been sitting in the memory pool for a while before that.

No, it's $200K for a beryllium ~~sphere~~ cathode.  They need to replace the existing part to reduce energy loss and contamination when doing experimental shots.  But Beryllium is highly toxic, so it is expensive to make parts from it, which is why they left it till last and used cheaper electrodes until now.
The current experimental program is costing about $5 million total.  Once they demonstrate feasibility, the next step is scaling it up, which requires bigger and more expensive machines.  The history of fusion research teaches us that scaling up finds new problems, but the payoff if this machine works is nothing less than a complete transformation of energy resources.  So it is worth spending some millions to find out if it works.

Lawsky was appointed by the governor of New York State, since the NYDFS is a department of the state government.  And it is not required to assume corruption to reach the result we see.  Financial services are a huge part of New York State's economy, because it is the home of the world's number one financial center.  No local government wants to lose that part of the economy.  Bitcoin can eliminate financial middlemen, and is therefore a threat to that economy.
A politician, or an administrator of a state budget, can conclude that they must deal with this threat to the local economy, even if it hurts the wider world economy.  This is protectionism, pure and simple.  Favoring local industry over competition.  
I have no evidence for corruption in the regulation process, nor do I have evidence for the lack of it.  I am merely pointing out that protecting the local economy is by itself sufficient reason to act against distributed peer-to-peer systems.

Eros is a stony-type asteroid, and the precious metals are found in the metallic portion.  A 1 km metallic asteroid might contain [400,000 tons]( of precious metals, worth $5 trillion (see Table 1).  Most of the value would be in Platinum and Rhodium, though, not gold.  It would also have a mass of about 4 billion tons.  So the ore value would be $1250/ton, or $1.25/kg.
Given that launching anything into orbit today is at least $1600/kg, we would need very efficient mining processes to do it profitably.  In all probability we need a large reduction in launch costs, plus building a lot of the equipment on-site out of the asteroid itself.  Metallic asteroids are typically iron-nickel alloys, which is a pretty good building material.

There are quite a few places with zero long term capital gains rate.  The theory is it encourages investment. Personal and corporate income taxes already tax the money once.  Taxing it again punishes making good investments.
Since countries differ wildly in their tax laws, you have the opportunity to arbitrage them by "offshoring" (moving money between countries).  For example, earning personal income where the personal taxes are low, and investing long term where the capital gains are low.  The rich and big corporations do this all the time.

Only to the extent of exchanging emails.  Our factory concepts are big on modular design, but not as a series of cubes.  For example, the building and floor layout are multiples of a grid, like 1 meter squares.  Each machine fills some number of grid units (1x1, 1x2, 2x2, etc) with standardized mounting points and utilities.  This is much like how expansion cards fit in a desktop PC.  Another example is a generic wheeled chassis, to which you can mount a variety of attachments, much like a farm tractor, but with robot arms and fork lifts.  That handles moving items from machine to machine.  
A series of linked cubes makes sense for serial production of the same item many times.  If you are making many different products, you want a flexible production flow.

There are two general classes of architecture, "vernacular" and "polite".  Vernacular is construction purely for functional needs - keeping rain off, keeping warm, etc.  The vast majority of all construction throughout history has been of this type.  Polite architecture is designed for style in addition to whatever functional needs it has to satisfy.  Functional needs are always there - a building will fall down or rot if it isn't structurally sound or have a proper roof.
From a technology standpoint, it is the functional side of architecture that matters, not the style.  Unfortunately my books are packed for a move, but a couple of developments in medieval times were stone foundations and the fireplace.  [Early buildings]( used timber posts set directly on the ground.  The lateral support of the soil kept them upright, so the roof beams could simply rest on top of the posts.  This was simple to build, but water rotted the posts after a generation or so and you had to rebuild the house.
Stone foundations (and their brick descendents) raised the wood above ground level, so that with proper care a house could last centuries.  But this now requires firm joints between the wood posts and beams, because the foundation isn't keeping the posts from tipping over.  Joinery required developing the right types of joints, and metal tools with which to cut them accurately, and finally marking techniques since the pieces were cut in a workshop, then assembled on site.
The same woodworking technology applied on a smaller scale resulted in the proliferation of furniture and other wooden products.  As you can see from the photo, early construction used earthen benches, with straw and fur for comfort.  There was not that much to move when the house was rebuilt.  More furniture and contents meant you didn't want to move as often, at the same time longer lasting buildings made that possible.
Early [castle great halls]( still had the same central firepit as the smaller houses did, and most of the residents slept there.  The chimney and fireplace improved the interior air quality, made cooking safer, provided better heating by their thermal mass, etc.  Their development required understanding how to shape them to draw air properly, and how to produce the stone, brick, and ceramic parts so they hold up to heat and not fall down.
With any technology before the modern age, progress was uneven by location.  It might take centuries for new developments to spread from where they originated across a continent.  They also require the right precursors to be in place.  Early plows were entirely made of wood, and early building construction used split rather than sawn wood, which can be accomplished with wood wedges and mallets.  Iron ploughshares and carpentry tools required sufficient quantities of iron, and blacksmithing technology first.

Torrents distributed by magnet links are already decentralized.  A node picks a random number when it joins the network.  The magnet link contains a hash of the torrent contents.  Whichever nodes chose the closest random number to the torrent hash get to serve the tracker data for everyone else.  Nodes self-organize according to "nearest bitwise node address".  Nearness is measured by counting how many bits are different in the self-chosen address.  
When you want a particular torrent, you ask a neighboring node "closer" to the hash value, which passes you on to another, and eventually you reach the "meeting place" of closest nodes, that tell you who else is in the swarm.  All you need to get started is the magnet link associated with the torrent and one bootstrap node already in the network.
Magnet links are a line or two of text, they can be distributed by any method online.  The real fun begins when you distribute a set of magnet links as itself a torrent (i.e. a meta-torrent).  The whole Pirate Bay database fit in a 90 MB torrent at one time.  The website is convenient, lets you find new torrents, and read the comments, but it is by no means necessary any more.

I recently bought a house the standard way, and the closing attorney required the funds from me (down payment) and my bank (mortgage lender) to be delivered to their account by bank wire the previous day.  They then check again with their own bank just before closing to make sure the funds are good.
In that kind of scenario, waiting an hour for 6 confirms is not an issue.  In general, for big transactions, there will be a neutral third party, or lots of checks and balances, before finalizing the transaction.  
I used to work for Boeing, and they are *really* fucking careful before handing over the keys to an airplane (and yes, they do have keys).  Partly Boeing's security in the sale is that the airline has to put a down payment with the order, and start making progress payments two years before delivery (which is about when Boeing starts committing resources to build it).  Bitcoin isn't ready to handle buying a big airplane.  But when it does, waiting for confirmations won't be an issue at all.
At the other extreme, double spend attempts are less than 1 in 1000 (and some of those are accidental).

I'm sure Buffet is up to speed on the industries he is invested in (insurance, railroads, etc.).  But he is one human being, and modern civilization is too complicated for one person to learn about all of it, there just isn't time.
Bitcoin is in the start-up / venture capital stage, and Buffet doesn't invest in that sort of thing.  He buys into companies that are more mature, and have a defendable edge on the competition.  For example, the BNSF railroad has the second largest rail network.  Building a competing railroad would be very expensive.  On routes where they have the only track, they are effectively a monopoly:

Network nodes keep a "memory pool" of recently arrived transactions that have not yet been put in a block.  In fact, that's where miners get the transactions to include in a block.  These unconfirmed transactions in the memory pool are still used to assess if a given address has enough balance to make another new transaction.  Every incoming transaction is checked against the node's copy of the Block Chain + memory pool.  If the sending address doesn't have enough balance, the transaction is rejected and not relayed to other nodes.
Nothing prevents making multiple transactions against a given address, as long as there is enough balance to cover them all.  But once the balance falls too low, they stop getting relayed, and that happens in in a matter of seconds for well connected nodes.  Sites like blockchain.info and mining pools have a financial incentive to be well connected (hundreds of links to other nodes), so in practice invalid transactions get stopped pretty quickly.

What's left out of the official company history is that the organizers of HSBC, including their first chairman, were involved in the opium trade.  These same people had been importing it illegally, until Chinese officials tried to stop it, and Britain went to war with China over the issue.  
The reason Britain supported the opium trade was they bought a lot of tea from China, which was draining their country's silver, the only thing Chinese merchants would accept as payment.  Selling opium balanced their trade, and preserved the monetary base of silver for coinage.

Each private key only is linked to one address.  A wallet file holds multiple sets of private key/public key/block chain address triplets, where the second and third are generated from the first.
As long as you have all the private keys, you can reconstruct the addresses that go with them, but not the other way.  So back up your wallet files.  Back them up lots.

The meta-problem is people online who say something is a problem, or is impossible, without actually doing the math (or doing a quick Google search for non-math things).
They just make assumptions or carry beliefs that are utterly untrue.  I don't know how to fix that meta-problem.  The above claim that the block chain will get too big to store is an example of this unthinking statement-making.  To give another example which comes up on this subreddit a lot:


This statement is often made as fact, when it isn't true at all.  In fact, US dollars are 96% backed by debt, 12% being collateral deposited at the Fed by banks, so they can obtain paper money and coins.  82% is created by bank loans via fractional reserve banking.  The last 4% is Fed holdings of gold certificates tied to Treasury depository gold.  The certificates can't actually be redeemed by the Fed, so depending on your viewpoint, that part of the dollar is either backed by gold, or backed by worthless certificates.

The "ponzi" guys are dumber.
"Tulips" is shorthand for "speculative bubble, of which the Dutch Tulip Mania is a classic example.  Speculative bubbles happen all the time.  That does not mean the underlying asset has no value, just that it is overpriced:  The dotcom boom of the late '90's, real estate boom of the 2000's, and the original tulip mania were all speculative bubbles.  Does anyone think internet companies or real estate have no value?  Floriculture (growing flowers for money) is a $100 billion business.
The bitcoin exchange rate has clearly gone through speculative bubbles.  But it has also settled at a higher level after each bubble.  So while the person saying "tulip" may have a point, there needs to be some justification why they think the price is too high.  Otherwise it is just an unsupported opinion.

The number of bitcoin owners is hard to determine.

We had plenty of [bank failures]( but that is not the same as a bank run, in the common understanding of the term.  A bank run is when the depositors all try to take out their money at once.  This is exactly what the FDIC was created to prevent, because news stories and photos of bank runs undermine confidence in the banking system as a whole.
A bank failure is when the bank no longer meets some minimum level of reserves, and the FDIC forces a merger, or asset sale + closure.  If there are insufficient assets to cover insured deposits, the FDIC makes up the difference from their insurance fund, but they try to take action before it gets that bad (not always successfully).
Before they fail, many banks are told to take corrective action by the FDIC.  These are called [problem banks]( of which there are around 400 right now.  They either fix their problem, or fail, to get off the list of problem banks.
If you were referring to the big failures, like AIG or Lehman Brothers, those were not bank runs either in the sense of depositors lining up.  The collapse in the value of mortgage-backed securities was so great, they could no longer meet their obligations to other banks, and trading partners.  Those other people would no longer do business with them.  But since all of Wall Street is heavily interlinked, freezing of trade with a few major players threatened to lock up the whole trading system.  The government stepped in as "lender of last resort" to prevent that from happening.

It might not be a whole new currency, but a bank could run an internal ledger denominated in bitcoin.  They already run ledgers for their fiat accounts, so it is not a new technology for them from that standpoint.  They then buy and sell bitcoin on the open market as needed to support the internal ledger.  They then arrange with people like BitPay and Coinbase to do one big transaction on the block chain rather than many small ones on behalf of their customers.
Instead of it taking 4 days to buy bitcoins via ACH on Coinbase, it could be immediate if my bank had an internal account for it.  Yadda yadda all the risks of getting a bank involved, I'm aware of those.  But if I could buy bitcoins instantly through online banking, then transfer them to my personal wallet within 24 hours by a big broadcast transaction covering all their customer withdrawals for the day, that's an improvement over the 4 business days it takes now.

One way around the regulations is to use the goods and services exemption.  An actual business that sells stuff accepts local currency and bitcoin.  Order cancellations can be refunded in either currency.  So if a customer orders in dollars, and then cancels and refunds in bitcoin, they are effectively buying bitcoin.
If the business is located outside NY State, and the refunds are not too big a share of their business, I think they could safely ignore any NY regulations, even from NY customers.

As an example of mining without block rewards, imagine the courthouse clerks who record deeds and other important papers switch to a blockchain system of records.  They get paid by the recording fees based on the underlying value of the assets (real estate), like they do today.  Mining is just a cost of operating the records system, since it needs periodic hashes to verify the contents of the records.
My point is a chain of hash values is a good way to prevent data corruption or tampering, for any database which adds new information constantly.  It doesn't need to be coupled to a currency system if there are other sources of value and operating fees to cover the cost.  Bitcoin had to be coupled to mining in order to have an incentive to build the network.  There wasn't any other source of value at first.

I see two problems with Shiller's analysis.  First, bitcoin is more of a payment network than a currency.  Thus it should be compared to other payment networks like VISA or bank check clearing/ATM systems.  There is certainly room for improvement and less overhead in a payment network, and that is all bitcoin needs to survive and prosper.
The second is that traditional "jobs" is not the goal in life.  Jobs are means to an end for most people, to get food, shelter, and the other stuff they really want.  As computers, automation, and robotics improve, it will be less and less necessary to work ordinary jobs.  As "programmable money", bitcoin is well suited to being a part of an automated future.
What people like Shiller should be worrying about is what happens when McDonald's fry cooks and Walmart shelf stockers get replaced by robots.  Do we allow the benefits of automation to flow only to corporate investors, and let everyone else starve?  Or do we put the automated means of production in the hands of the people, so they can take care of themselves?  I vote for the latter, which is why I'm working on distributed and self-expanding automation.  It is the only way I see to get to an automated world that doesn't involve mass poverty for the unlucky, or continuing government interference by taking from those who have to give to those who have less.

No, they cannot.  A transaction which sends more BTC than is available at an address is invalid. If it were allowed, you could create infinite coins by sending more than exists at an address to yourself at another address, then spend the positive address.
Each node on the bitcoin network (computers running a copy of a full bitcoin client like BitcoinQt) examines incoming transactions against the balance in the sending address(es).  It uses the block chain + memory pool of recent transactions not yet in a block to calculate the current balance for the address.  This is simple addition of all the in and out transfers.  If the transaction requires more than the current balance, it is rejected.
This both prevents "double spending" (only the first transaction to arrive is accepted), and prevents negative balances.  Rejected transactions do not get passed on to the next node, therefore don't propagate across the peer-to-peer network, and don't get included in blocks.

Here is one way to approach it:
Bitcoin ATM owner sets up *two* ATMs - one in a popular coffee shop or whatever, the other in the back room of the cannabis shop.  Shop feeds their cash sales into the machine, gets BTC in return, which they can send off to Coinbase or an exchange (or set up a localbitcoins business in their shop).
ATM owner regularly empties both ATMs, deposits in bank.  If bank asks, he points to coffee shop machine, and articles about how much goes through the Toronto and other ATMs.
This is kind of a round-about mess, but it's the kind of thing they need to do if the banks won't do business with them.

The delay is due to the bank Automated Clearing House (ACH system).  Banks only settle up with each other once a day for all the checks and ACH transfers going in both directions that day.  This happens at a "clearing house", which is either a district Federal Reserve Bank (there are 12 of them), or one of a few private clearing houses.
Each bank is a member of the clearing house, and after totaling up all the incoming and outgoing payments, they make one daily transfer to or from their account at the clearing house.  Since the total of incoming and outgoing transactions across all the banks at the clearing house is zero, no actual money moves. It is just a rearrangement of balances across all their accounts.  If a particular bank has too much or too little in their account, that's when real money moves.
If a payment has to go between clearing houses, it takes one day to move from the sending bank to the cross-house account, one day to move between clearing houses, and one day to move from the receiving clearing house to the destination bank.  That's because all the clearings happen at the close of business at the same time, so each step has to happen on different days.  The final day is from the local bank to notify Coinbase that the funds have arrived.  
Once Coinbase knows the money is there, they credit your account with the bitcoins relatively fast.  Pulling BTC out to a wallet on your own PC takes just a few minutes.  I buy my coins from them, and a transaction from them to my personal address usually is broadcast that fast.  Within 30-60 minutes there will be several blocks on the Block Chain confirming the transaction, so you can be sure the coins are in your control at that point.

As I said above, I am working on it.  I can't yet prove it is cheaper for commercial production, but sometimes cheaper isn't the goal.  If a distributed network can satisfy the material needs of the owners (food, shelter, utilities, etc.), they become layoff-proof.  That is a worthy goal in itself.
When you factor in that the network is self-expanding (uses existing machines to make more machines), I think it is also likely to be cheaper through reduced capital cost.

You know, this has been debunked lots of times.  Maybe you should read up.
For a small purchase, like buying a soda at a convenience store, the loss to a double-spend is small for the business, and the odds of a double-spend are 1 in 10,000 last time I looked.  So they go ahead and complete the sale without waiting for confirmation.
For a medium purchase, like a piece of furniture, they might pull up your sending address, and check that the funds in it are well-confirmed (at least 6).  Then they wait after you send them your payment for a few minutes to make sure no other spend appears from that address except to them.  
Network propagation time is on the order of seconds, so within minutes they can be pretty sure no other transaction can come ahead of theirs, and their payment is good.  With a furniture item, you have to arrange delivery details, or they have to move it from the display area to your vehicle anyway, so by the time that's done, the minutes to be sure payment is good is over.
For a big purchase, like a house, your funds are required to be in escrow at the closing attorney, and the stack of paperwork to sign takes at least an hour.  So waiting an hour for 6 confirmations is not an issue, you had to get your funds to them ahead of time anyway.
If you think waiting is a problem, provide an example where the type of purchase and waiting time actually causes an inconvenience.  In the above examples it does not.

Bitcoin uses "Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm" (ECDSA) to calculate the public key from the private key.  The algorithm is designed so that doing the reverse isn't possible except by brute forcing all the possible private keys, a "lifetime of the Universe" proposition.
Bitcoin software clients and apps usually have code to do this algorithm, so that you can load a private key, and it spits out the corresponding public key and bitcoin address so you can make transactions with it.  Most software hides the details, because humans suck at entering long alphanumeric codes.  Instead you scan a QR code or load a wallet.dat file and the rest is done for you automatically.

The deflation boogyman is a fallacy.  The S&amp;P 500 is "deflationary" in the sense that it's value tends to grow faster than the inflation rate.  Do people stop spending and hoard stocks? Nope.
What really happens is people spend part of their income for immediate needs (food, shelter, utilities, transportation), and some of it goes into savings.  Whether there is inflation or deflation does not change this situation.  You still need to eat, live somewhere, and run the air conditioner in the summer.
What deflation does is change the numbers to calculate real returns on investments.  Right now, if you earn a nominal 8%, and inflation is 2%, your real return is 8-2=6%.  That's how much more stuff you can buy in the future relative to spending it today.  If the inflation rate is -2% (i.e. deflation), then the nominal rate of 8% becomes a real rate of 8+2 = 10%.
The higher real return would attract more savings, but then by supply and demand the additional savings would bid up the prices of productive assets and lower their nominal returns.  The end result is the same real returns, just with a different number to adjust nominal to real.

Apparently you haven't heard of the idea of digital signatures in bitcoin.  The investment fund can sign a message with their private key, and you observe from the block chain that the assets are still at the matching address.  This shows the fund still has control of the assets, and hasn't sold them off somewhere else.

There is no such thing as intrinsic value.  Every person has their own list of needs and desires.  They are not only different between people, but for the same person at different times.  I own a lot of books in paper form.  With the advent of digital books, the paper ones have become devalued, because they take up space and are heavy to move.  So mostly I give them away to the local library when I finish reading them.  So what's the intrinsic value of a book?  It's a meaningless question as stated.
Since people put different values on things, trade can happen because each person values what the other person has more than what they have.  Thus both of them are more satisfied after the trade.  If there was an unalterable intrinsic value for everything, someone would always lose out on a trade, or at best come out even.  In that case, no trades would happen.  It takes work to make a trade.  You have to find someone to trade with, negotiate the deal, then execute it.  If you only end up even at best, why even do it?

"Whoever develops the killer app that makes Bitcoin a household word will have to figure out what problem Bitcoin actually solves, Angel said."
* Fiat inflation robbing people of their savings
* Central banks actually robbing people of their savings (Cyprus)
* Currency controls preventing transactions the government doesn't like (international, too much cash or privacy)
* Lack of service from existing institutions (6 billion unbanked worldwide, "we don't do business in that country")
* Privacy and fraud problems with existing payment methods (credit cards)
* High fees and slow clearing with existing payment methods
* Fiat is difficult to automate as it has relics from a physical origin and no scripting language.  It is opaque and requires trust from demonstrated untrustworthy institutions.  It has poor inherent security, and therefore requires a lot of security overhead (anti-counterfeiting measures, armored trucks, cameras, guards, tellers checking each other to prevent theft, etc.)
Is that enough solved problems, Prof. Angel?

UPS shipping labels have no intrinsic value either, by themselves.  It's the network of trucks, drivers, and distribution terminals that give the labels a value that people are willing to pay for.  Similarly, with bitcoin, address balances on the block chain are just numbers in a big accounting database.  It's the network of miners, nodes, websites, users, and merchants that give those balances a usefulness that people are willing to trade for.
Bitcoin can't function without the network, and only looking at a portion of that network (entries in the block chain) in isolation is a mistake.

No, I don't care.  The government and banking system *already* monitor financial transactions.  You know what? The 9/11 highjackers used that system and they weren't caught.  Their expenses in the US were funded by things like Western Union money transfers.  It was split up into small enough amounts that nobody noticed.  
On the other end of the size scale, I worked at Manufacturers Hanover (now JPMorgan Chase) international check clearing department on Wall Street, in college.  I saw million dollar checks from tiny banks in Colombia being deposited.  In retrospect, this was obviously drug money being "offshored" to a safer location like NY or London.  Thirty years later big banks are still laundering drug money.
The NSA and the FBI are not omnicient.  They are government offices staffed by mostly ordinary people.  They catch some people, and miss others.  Bitcoin probably lowers their catch rate somewhat, because it gives less identity data to start with.

This is an incorrect argument.  Lets say the bitcoin deflation rate is 2% per year.  The long term return of the stock market is 9.6%.  Since the return is greater than doing nothing, people will invest.  When you dig deeper, business profits should increase in a deflationary environment, because their costs are decreasing.  So the return on stocks should increase, compensating for the deflation rate.

Intrinsic value is a fallacy.  People must value things differently or else trade would not happen.  Value is assigned by people, not an intrinsic property like 79 is the atomic number for Gold.  But each person may assign a different value to a given item.  In ordinary retail, the merchant values the item on the shelf less than the marked price, or else they would keep it.  Customers value the item more than the marked price, or else they would not buy it.  But every customer has a different set of values, and thus buys different items. 
Value also changes with time.  At one point Uranium compounds were only useful for coloring glass, then we figured out nuclear reactions and it's much more valuable.  Conversely computers are constantly worth less, because better and cheaper models keep coming out.
"Utility" is a property of things.  An apple supplies the same number of calories no matter what price it sells at, and a wifi router supplies a fixed amount of wireless bandwidth.  When those features are useful to people, we say the item has utility.

Whether bitcoin is money is irrelevant to this situation.  As their name indicates, the Securities and Exchange Commission regulates securities and exchanges.  MPEx clearly describes itself as "the Bitcoin securities exchange" (it's the page header of their website  ).
On the face of it, that would make them the kind of entity subject to SEC oversight *unless* they are exempt.  One reason to be exempt is lack of jurisdiction.  If they are located outside the US and do not deal with US customers, they are clearly exempt. If they are outside the US and deal with promotors (people who try to sell new securities) or customers who buy and sell shares that are in the US, I don't know what the legal situation is.
A "security" is any right to profit off the work of others, such as bonds or stock shares.  So being a partner in a small business is not a security, because you actively operate the business.  A mortgage note secured by the assets of the business *is* a security (that's where the name comes from).  The lender is profiting from the work of the partners, without doing any work themselves.  So is selling partial ownership to an investor who only puts in money but does not work (percentage or shares).
But not all securities are regulated by the SEC.  There are exemptions for small amounts, number of investors, and types of investors.  Most US states also have local securities laws.  So you can be exempt from SEC oversight, and still fall under state regulation.
Investments don't have to be in the form of money.  An investor can contribute land, equipment, or other things of value.  Bitcoin certainly meets the "thing of value" test, as it is actively traded on exchanges and used to buy stuff from merchants.

Bitcoin isn't the *only* funding source for this project, but a particularly convenient one.  Project contributors can track when and where their funds are spent, so it's transparent compared to conventional companies.
I assure you I'm quite capitalist (I hold bond funds and rental property personally).  Contributors are "tenants in common", the same legal status as real estate with multiple owners.  The nearest comparison is a time-share condo, except instead of a slice of the calendar, we have a slice of the machine time and outputs that contributors can use for themselves.
The main point is bitcoin doesn't have to be the equivalent of putting cash under the mattress.  It can be invested and put to productive use like fiat currency or any other asset.  It doesn't yet have all the investment tools older products have, but that's just because it has only been around for 5 years.  There's nothing inherent to bitcoin that prevents making such tools.

Using it at a convenience store is dumb.  That's a "card present" transaction, where you are on security camera, and often have to sign the slip or enter a PIN.  The thief is much safer selling the card info on IRC, or ordering non-physical goods online.  Physical goods need a delivery address, so that is another risk.
It's also hard to steal *just* a credit card, unless you work at a restaurant.  More likely is to steal a whole leather wallet or a purse.  In that case you get multiple cards, cash, plus home address off their ID.  That's worth quite a bit more than a drink and chips at a local store.

I keep pointing out that the Code of Hammurabi, the first law code of which we have a record, listed punishments for financial crimes.  I think it is safe to say every currency ever has been used by criminals.
That goes for pre-coinage currencies too.  When cattle was money, people raided and stole cattle.  When the first grain stores were built in the Middle East (near Damascus and Jericho), I'm sure someone was stealing grain.  That's just human nature.  If taking an asset is easier than working for it, some people will steal.
It goes even farther back.  Theft is a [valid evolutionary strategy among mammals](  If it takes you less energy to raid the other squirrel's hoard of nuts than to run around collecting your own, you have more energy to do other things, like reproduce.
Humans are social animals, and we have a strong sense of fairness because we survive best in groups.  Taking from the group for your personal stash breaks the reciprocity on which the group depends - I do something for you today, you do something for me tomorrow.  So we label breaking of group trust as crimes and punish people who do it (sometimes).
But that does not eliminate the temptation to "get something for nothing" by theft or fraud, it is too ingrained in biological history.  So when designing financial systems, you have to **assume it will happen if given a chance**, and think long and hard about how to prevent it.  As an engineer, I think of it like a boat in the water.  A boat will leak and sink if given a chance.  Water is always looking for a way to get in.  So you have to be very careful to design ways to keep the water out, detect if it is leaking, pump out the bits that leak in anyway.  Financial systems need at least as much care.

Federal regulators have testified that existing laws and regulations are adequate.  So the burden is on New York to show why they are not adequate, and why the cure isn't worse than the disease.
On the latter point, we could, for example, eliminate money laundering by eliminating money.  That is obviously overkill and nobody would do it.  Not as obvious is the burden of too much regulation to solve a minor problem.  If you raise the cost to consumers by $3 for every $1 of bad stuff you stop, the consumer still has a net loss.  They would be better off if you didn't over-regulate.

Your answer ignores the fact that alternate cryptocurrencies, notably litecoin, already exist and are inflating the total volume of such coins.  
Someone can come along and make a new cryptocurrency with the exact same properties as bitcoin (mining rate, max number of coins, etc.).  Let's call it bitcoin2.  It would have it's own block chain, but is otherwise identical.  Then a wallet program can be written that handles both the original bitcoin and bitcoin2.  In theory they should be fungible, but the total number of coins will grow beyond 21 million.

I participated in OSE and credit them as one of the sources for my current project, along with a 1980 NASA study on self-replicating Lunar factories.


Sustainability is one of my explicit design requirements.  Part of what the self-expanding factory does is build it's own power supply, initially as a mix of wind turbines, solar concentrators, and biofuel.  The solar concentrators are split between boiling water to run a turbine/generator, and direct heating for industrial processes.  A sufficiently hot furnace can also melt scrap metal into castings, produce bricks, and cement for concrete, all basic products that are also energy intensive.
Our first generation design won't make everything people need and want.  We are aimed at the basics of food, shelter, and utilities, so that people can be layoff-proof.  In other words, you can still eat and keep warm without a paid job.


Self-replication of the starter kits, and open sourcing the design for the starter kit, so anyone can copy it.  Shipping energy is the product of mass x distance, and sending electronics pales compared to shipping iron ore and coal and then re-shipping the resulting steel globally.  You are talking gigatons.  A billion smartphones is something like a megaton.


If I have a self-sustaining (energy and spare parts) production system that meets my basic needs for food, shelter, and utilities, capitalist megafactories don't matter, because I simply don't need to buy their products.  I don't need to get a job to pay rent or a mortgage, because the robots supply the building materials, and possibly assemble the house.  There will be specialty items that can't be made locally by the network of people trading in a MakerNet.  For those things normal capitalism still applies.


That's not likely how it works out.  How often do you need new furniture, and therefore a suite of automated woodworking machines?  It's more likely you buy a share of a woodworking shop as needed, and resell it when you don't need it any more.  Alternately a small business owner runs the wood shop, and trades with the robot farm owner, etc. for the other products they need.  Even with automation, you need some specialized skill to tell the machines what to do and when.
At a very early startup stage, you can have a 3D printer and I can have a lathe, and we can trade.  But pretty quickly you will want to grow to a size where it is efficient for one person to have the skills for one specialty, rather than each person knowing everything to make all their own stuff.
Our R&amp;D location in Fairburn, GA is in the industrial area of Atlanta Metro.  If we outgrow our current 2.7 acres, there's plenty of industrial/commercial zoned land around, so that should not be an issue (at least not any worse than for any other factory).

I assume you have a reasonable idea of the return rate for your sales, and how long that takes before a sale is "final".  So just hold a reserve from sales in BTC in BTC form to cover returns.  You may incur some currency risk from not cashing all the BTC immediately to local currency, but it should average out.  By the time returns on BTC sales are more than a trivial fraction of your overall business, there should be hedging products available.
The alternative is to make clear refunds are in local currency only, and BTC is just a payment method.  In fact, that is what bitcoin is - a transaction network for moving value from person to person.  It's not designed to be a long term store of value, although lots of people speculate on the  future value as if it is.

We here on are right up to the hour on current bitcoin news.  The general public only has vague notions based on things they have seen in the mainstream media going back months (Silk Road bust, price "crash" in December).  We know it "crashed" to a level 4 times higher than it was in September, but for headline/clickbait purposes it was described as a crash by all the general media, and that impression ha stuck.  Now people are given the impression "bitcoin filed for bankruptcy", however wrong that is.
Slightly more savvy investors (the kind that look up stock charts and read up on companies) will be more likely to jump in when the investment products become available.  That's because they will see the actual price action, and more current news.
Those products (funds they can buy through their broker) are not yet ready for the typical retail investor.  Buying bitcoins right now is a little like buying an actual 42 gallon barrel of oil and taking it home with you as an investment.  It's not very easy or convenient.

Standard servers haven't been useful to mine bitcoins for three or four years now.  "Mining" is the process of finding a hash value (checksum) for a block of new transactions.  It is highly repetitive and benefits from massive parallelism.  So people quickly transitioned to using graphics cards, which have hundreds to thousands of cores.  After that they used Field Programmable Gate Arrays, and now Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs).  Graphics cards are optimized for doing the kind of calculations needed to display images.  FPGAs and ASICs are optimized to do the exact calculation needed for bitcoin mining.  They are so vastly more efficient than any other method, that there is no financial reason to use anything but the best ASICs today.

* Medieval blacksmiths were able to make their own tools, as well as the tools everyone else used.  The trick is that heating in a forge softens the metal so you can shape it, while your tools (hammer, anvil, and tongs) stay cool enough to not deform when you use them.  Optionally you also heat-treat the metal by quenching (plunging into water or other liquid) and slight re-heating.  
Quenching freezes the metal in a harder but more brittle crystalline form.  Annealing, which is re-heating slowly to a specified moderate temperature, allows a controlled amount of change back to the default ductile form.  So depending on whether you need a hard edge (knives and chisels) or toughness (hammers and picks) you can get that in a controlled amount, even varying it in different parts of the same tool.
Closing the loop for toolmaking, by supplying the raw materials (iron ore and charcoal), you needed shovels, picks, and axes (for wood to make charcoal), all of which the blacksmith can make the metal parts for directly, and the wood-shaping tools for the woodworker to make handles, wheelbarrows, wagons, etc.
* Wooden ships in the age of exploration up through the 19th century often carried enough tools to rebuild the ship and repair most of the other parts.  They couldn't go to Home Depot to get a new mast after a storm.
* Settlers at any time in history that moved into a new area would bring enough of a starter set of tools to live.  For example, in the US, when wagon trains were moving people west, each family would have their own farm tools, but typically they would try to include a smith or other toolmaker so they would not have to import replacements all the time.

* In our own project, we have tried to identify a self-reproducing set of tools and machines.  What we find is that 100% self-copying is an ideal, like a 100% efficient engine.  What you generally find is that there are hard-to-make items, or ones that use rare or hard to extract materials.  Rather than try to do those items internally, it is more efficient to trade something you *can* make for those items.
Starting with a core starter set (the "seed factory") you can make a moderately high percentage of your own parts.  Using that set to make additional machines will increase the percentage you can make.  Some outside supply will be needed, but that will decrease as you build up your collection of tools and machines.  For a given sized community that the outputs are intended for, you eventually reach a "saturation point" where you have all the machines it is reasonable to have, and the remaining percentage of stuff you can't make you just trade for.  
At some point on your growth trajectory you can produce a new starter set, and thus replicate the growth.  This is similar to how a tree doesn't reproduce another tree directly.  It produces seeds that grow into more trees using local energy and materials at their new location.

When it was just the two Steves (Wozniak and Jobs) they could be rebels.  Now Apple is 60% owned by "[Institutional Investors]( - banks, brokerage houses, mutual funds, retirement funds, trusts, and hedge funds.  Those big investors are also known as Wall Street for short, although they are actually located worldwide.
Apple has become just another front man brand name for Wall Street, like almost every large corporation.  Big investors have only one common purpose - to maximize profits.  Everything else is secondary.  So any company you are interested in, look up the institutional holdings.  If it's over 50%, you can be sure the profit motive is in charge.  The only thing holding it back is with newer companies, the founders hold a big enough share to make a difference.  But eventually they sell out or die off, and leave Wall Street in control.
Note that this system of control is recursive.  Institutional investors also hold a majority share of big banks and other financial houses.  For example they hold 60% of the shares of [Bank of America]( and the list of top shareholders includes other major banks.  So in reality, a small number of decision makers at these big institutions send out the orders to increase profits, and the rest of the financial industry follows their orders.  Those orders get relayed through boards of directors and top executives, down through the corporate ranks.   The end result is decisions like this one to strangle any competition to Apple's own payment system.

The US has around 8,000 separate banks, much more than most countries.  They can't eliminate old systems until *everyone* has updated to the new ones, so it takes a long time.  Because of travel times, we established a network of clearing-houses (12 Federal Reserve district banks, and half a dozen privately run ones).  Banks still settle up with each other daily for all their customer's transactions in both directions.  The ones that owe a net outgoing balance post funds to the clearing house.  Then the ones due a net incoming balance get paid by the clearing house.  At the end of the daily process, the clearing house holds no funds, and everyone is happy.
Electronic clearing can go faster, but some banks have not yet updated their systems, and still have lots of customers that write paper checks and only accept such checks (My electric utility only takes cash and checks at their office, for example, and charges a fee for online payments).  So they can't yet go to hourly clearing without breaking the system.

BitPay is a "payment processor".  They accept bitcoins on a merchant's behalf, using tools like web page plugins or shopping carts.  They then deposit local currency to the merchant's account, and collect a small fee for the service.
The merchant thus doesn't touch bitcoin and is not exposed to any market fluctuations.  Behind the scenes, BitPay sells off the coins they get from these merchant transactions in bulk on exchanges.  They have 30,000 registered merchants, so they probably have good deals with the exchanges, and a few big trades by them is more efficient than thousands of merchants selling coins on their own.

Whatever else you think of Wall Street, at least they can do basic accounting and know how to build electronic trading systems, unlike a recently deceased amateur exchange.
It will also make it easier to buy coins.  Banks may close your account if you buy from Coinbase or another bitcoin exchange too much.  But they would have no problem with a regular brokerage.  If the brokerage allows you buy bitcoins for your account, and allows sending them out *as bitcoins*, that is an improvement.  It smooths the path for converting fiat to BTC.
Howevery, if the brokerages only allow holding the BTC in their accounts, and not pay it out, then it is not an improvement, it just makes BTC another commodity to be traded.

First of all, bitcoin is regulated, by the software.  Thus the bitcoin "money supply" (how many coins are in circulation) is capped, and released on a predictable schedule.  Many see that as an advantage over being regulated by a central bank with fallible humans, but the point is we have choice.  We can choose to use bitcoin or not, and by doing so choose the regulation built into it.
Regulation forced on people with no choice but to follow it, and no real hand in crafting it is less desirable from a moral standpoint, and likely from a technical standpoint.  The NYDFS may understand traditional finance, but the bitcoin community of users and developers knows way more about bitcoin than anyone else.  If they had involved us as partners in developing regulations, in an open environment, we would not be so hateful.  Instead, they did what regulators usually do, write the regulations behind closed doors, then throw a package of shit in a brown paper wrapper over the fence.


They aren't doing a very good job of it.  See mortgage-backed securities fraud (of which I'm a victim and in several class actions), LIBOR price fixing (many consumer loans are tied to that rate), Bernard Madoff, John Corzine.  I could go on.  Yes, bitcoin has had it's share of scams and frauds, anything to do with money will attract such.  But we seem to be learning from them and making efforts to design around the problems (multi-sig wallets, hardware wallets, distributed exchanges, etc.).  
The question is whether internal evolution of the bitcoin ecosystem is a better approach to rooting out fraud than top-down regulation.  I can't answer that, but assuming top-down is the only approach is wrong.


Only 18 months ago, the bitcoin money supply (coins in circulation x exchange rate) was only $140 million, and only a couple of thousand merchants accepted it, none of them big names.  Before that it was too small to notice or bother with for the major financial markets.  Shortly thereafter bitcoin exploded in price and attention, and a few months later you started having congressional hearings and other governments issuing policies.  Governments and big institutions by their nature are slow moving beasts, and this is just how long it has taken for them to react.

I do, but then I spent a summer in college working at Manufacturer's Hanover (now JP Morgan Chase) check clearing building in lower Manhattan.  In the US, money going between banks goes through clearing-houses.  Each Federal Reserve district bank (there are 12) runs a clearing house, and there are a few private ones also.
Rather than transfer money from one bank to another for every check and debit card transaction, what they do is total up all the daily transactions going in and out of a bank.  If the bank has a net outgoing amount, it sends it to a special account the clearinghouse set up just for that day.  Once all the banks that need to send are finished, the clearinghouse then distributes the funds to the banks that have a net incoming balance for the day.  When the process finishes, the special account should be empty (i.e. cleared), and is then closed.  In practice, it often isn't, and then the clearinghouse staff tries to figure out what to do with any shortages or surplus.
This process of throwing all the money into one account and then distributing it is simpler than each bank sending funds to many of the ~1000 banks that use the same clearinghouse.  Since the clearinghouse system dates back before computers, simple was good.
If funds have to go internationally, or between banks on different clearinghouses, then you have another step in between.  Thus in the worst case, when you make an ACH transfer to Coinbase to buy bitcoins, it has to go from your bank &gt; your clearing house &gt; their clearing house &gt; their bank &gt; appears on their account balance.  Since clearing only happens once a day, at the end of the day, that's why it takes 4 business days for Coinbase to deliver your bitcoins via ACH.  It takes that long for your money to show up.  If you add a credit card, you can buy instantly, because they have an alternate way to get paid in case the ACH transfer fails.  It can fail, for example, if there is insufficient funds in your checking account.
ACH, by the way, stands for "Automated Clearinghouse", and just means the payment info is going by computer instead of a paper check.  But until the whole system is updated and ready to go to faster clearing, we are stuck with the daily cycle.

* I didn't give away the land, the county paid me for the right of way.  A "right of way" is exactly what it sounds like, a right of travel for the holder of the right (the county) and whoever they permit (the public in this case).  I could still make modifications within the right of way, for example putting in a new driveway, as long as it didn't interfere with the road and access to it.
Technically I still owned the land under the road, and if the county abandoned the road sometime in the future it would revert to the owners.  This in fact had happened on another unpaved road nearby because the bridge had worn out and collapsed.  The wooden bridge on *my* road collapsed because a logging truck weighing four times the load limit tried to drive across it.  The county decided to do a new concrete bridge and straighten and widen the road leading up to it, thus the need for a right of way.
* The county didn't build the original road, the farmers and timberland owners did, a few generations ago, so they could access their respective land.  Since the county was putting significant investment into the bridge and improvements, they wanted a formal right of way for the public instead of the informal easement created by long term use.
* Whether it was the county road department or a community landowner's association making the improvements would make no difference to me.  It was a sensible improvement and I was happy to sell the right of way to help make it happen.  Instead of sending tax money to Washington D.C., who then sends highway funds to the States, who in turn send it to counties and cities for specific projects (like this bridge), the money could just as well stay local in a community association for road maintenance and construction.  Freeloader landowners just would not get any maintenance or upgrades.  In new development areas that situation would just not arise, because membership in the association would be a covenant that runs with the land, set up that way by the developers.

It doesn't have to be all or nothing.  Just like with cell phones, some people get an unlimited monthly plan, other people use pay-as-you-go minutes plans.
Netflix can offer a block of watching for, say, $10.  That would give you some number of movies or TV episodes to watch, with no time limit.  If it takes you two or three months to watch that many, so be it.  High volume watchers would want to go with an unlimited plan, but occasional watchers  might want a pay-as-you-go plan.
The business question for Netflix is do they gain more revenue from new people for an additional plan than they lose from people downgrading from a full monthly plan.  
This question is orthogonal to bitcoin adoption.  They can sell blocks of watching time with or without bitcoin.

As an example, the business of notaries is witnessing and proving something existed (a contract, deed, etc.).  Traditionally this was done by putting a piece of paper in front of them and they signed it and stamped it.  A block chain allows them to do a similar job in electronic form.  They get a fee from a customer, and it is then in their interest to mine that block chain to keep it secure.

One we settle on using "Bits" as the currency unit, perhaps the confusion between the Bitcoin Payment Network and the bitcoin unit of measure on the block chain will stop.  The payment network is more efficient than traditional credit cards, as Mr. Schiff and 60,000 other merchants have figured out.  
It's more efficient for individuals too.  I live in a different city than my rental house.  If my tenant used bitcoin, she wouldn't have to buy a money order and mail it, and I wouldn't have to go to the credit union to deposit it.  Not to mention the time delays for mail delivery and the deposit to clear.  Less overhead and delays make bitcoin useful.  
The more demand to use the payment network, the more demand for units on the block chain, because that's the only way you can make transactions.  Since the supply of units is finite, supply and demand then sets a price for them.
"Intrinsic value" is a fallacy.  Every person values things differently.  The Bitcoin Network performs a useful function - that's where it's value comes from.  In turn, demand to use the network creates demand for the units, whether they are called "BTC", "Bits" or "Satoshi".  Those are just different sizes of units.

This is incorrect.  You can have different micropayment services that each handles internal transactions between users on its own books.  Cross-service payments are aggregated together into larger block chain transactions on a periodic basis.  The information on who gets paid at the ends is sent separately, on a side data path off the block chain.
This is in fact how the traditional banking system works.  Every single check and debit card transaction isn't paid individually.  They are grouped into daily totals, and the net difference between incoming and outgoing are settled through a clearing-house between banks.

The earliest use of virtual currency for sex services that I know of was around 2005, in Second Life.  That started out as avatar sex/naughty text chat, but quickly branched out to voice, photos, videos, and live webcam.
As part-owner of an "escort club" in SL, we even had attempts at live escorts (i.e arranging to meet and payment in SL, but for live sex), but as SL was based in California it was illegal for us to host such activity.  So we told the girls who were offering live services they could not do it through our club.  I'm certain that such activity happened, just more clandestinely.
The same reasons apply as for bitcoin - Second Life Linden Dollar transactions were irreversible, had no internal overhead, could be cashed out to PayPal to US dollars, users were more or less anonymous to each other, and it showed up as "game purchase" on credit cards.
I class Linden Lab (the owners of Second Life) not expanding their virtual currency beyond their virtual world as one of the great missed opportunities of history.  The reason they didn't? Pierre Omidyar, one of the founders of Ebay, was an original investor in Second Life, and of course Ebay owns PayPal.  Second Life has a good rate on cashing out because of this ($1 flat fee), but they didn't want the competition for money services.  Instead, digital currencies like bitcoin will likely do serious damage to PayPal.

Yes, most people don't understand this.  "A bitcoin" is a unit of measure, like "a meter" or "a kilogram".  Rather than length or mass, what we are measuring is transaction size or address balance on the Block Chain.  
In the case of the Block Chain as a whole, we can say it contains ~13.3 million bitcoins.  It's a measured property, like an MS Word document can be said to contain a certain number of pages or words.  Each "coinbase" transaction (the first one in each block that rewards the miner) increases the total amount by (currently) 25 bitcoins.
Just like our baby-sitting ledger, the Block Chain in and of itself is just a collection of entries.  What gives a ledger meaning is the agreement of the users that it records meaningful real world events.  Thus, I watched your kids, and I now have a positive balance on the ledger to use later.  Or, you sent me two pizzas, and I sent you 10,000 bitcoins to use later (to use the first real bitcoin transaction as an example).
As long as the Bitcoin community agrees to track real world events using our shared ledger, and we have the expectation of trading our balances for something in the future, then balances measured in bitcoins will have value.

The labels on the [Adoption Curve]( say that Innovators are the first 2.5%, and Early Adopters are the next 13.5%.  
There is no way bitcoin has reached 16% market penetration yet, so the people who say the early adopter phase is over are simply wrong.  Assuming around 5 million consumer wallets represented 5 million users (they don't), and total internet users are 3 billion, we are optimistically at 1/6th of 1 percent penetration.  More realistically it is 0.1%.  Therefore we are still very early in the innovator phase.

People lease shares in a hosted blockchain server - located in a data center, with dedicated software to do nothing but maintaining a copy of the block chain.  Lots of hard drives, and maybe tape backup to store pruned transactions (outputs all spent).  As long as there are ~hundreds of such separate servers, you are still distributed enough.  Anyone with a serious bitcoin business would also want their own copy of the block chain, and they will pay to run it as a cost of doing business.

The very first bitcoin transfer, between Satoshi and Hal Finney, was just a test of sending coins.  Between that time and the canonical First Pizza, people were building software and a network.  The network and software are what make the tokens (outputs on the block chain, measured in units we call "a bitcoin") useful, and therefore have value.  If you couldn't move the tokens from one address to another, they would have no useful function, and therefore no value to anyone.
As the ecosystem of users, software, smarphone apps, custom mining hardware, ATM's, web API's etc. gets larger and better, it gets easier to acquire and move the tokens.  That makes them more useful, and therefore have more value in trade.
A USD $10 paper note is also a token, measured in units we call "dollars".  If there were no ecosystem of users and all the other trading infrastructure around it, those tokens would just be pretty printed paper.  The Confederate currency from the US Civil War, the Ecuadorian Sucre, and the Zimbabwe Dollar have all lost their ecosystems (they all now use the U.S. Dollar).  Thus their paper tokens are reduced to collector's items as artwork or historical.

Accredited investors are part of the Securities Act of 1933 under which the SEC was first created.  To remove the rules associated with them, you would first have to change the law.
Note that any old moron can invest in "registered securities" - meaning they go through all the SEC paperwork and file all the required reports.  If you want to be exempt from registration (i.e. much less paperwork), one of the exemptions is to only take money from accredited or "sophisticated" (another category) investors.  So the choice for a business raising capital is (a) provide enough public information through the registration process, or (b) only take money from people who theoretically know what they are doing.
The SEC was created to enforce that dichotomy (registration or exempt).  If you want to let people invest in any old shady deal, then you are in fact undercutting the reason the SEC was created.

An estimated 20% of the US economy is "underground" - i.e. not reported to the IRS and local tax authorities.  Most of that is otherwise legal activity, like contractors who get paid in cash "under the table".  If you are not too blatant about it, like 80% of your contracting work is by check and reported and 20% is in cash and not reported, then odds are you can get away with it.  
The IRS has limited staff and budget, and most of it goes to handling 130 million returns filed every year.  They simply don't have the resources to chase everyone, so they go after whatever is easiest to collect.  If they get a form 1099 filed that's not on your return, they will send you a letter asking why.  If your income and deductions are way out of line for your business or the zip code you live at, their computer will pop out that return for a human to look at, and maybe trigger an audit.  If you have an enemy that reports you for tax evasion (and the 10% reward), they will follow up.
Otherwise it's like an inverse lottery.  The odds of getting audited are ~100:1, and the odds of serving jail time are more than 20,000:1 for tax crimes (unless you are a drug dealer, then it is more likely).  If you wish to play in that lottery, you win as long as your number does **not** come up, if it does you lose.

Well, then they have to bear the burden of storing and distributing their data.  A magnet URI is just the hash of the data contents.  Torrent networks point you to sources for the data in a distributed way(1), but someone has to seed it (provide a full copy of the actual data).  Services like Mastercoin or Counterparty would have to do that themselves.  The bitcoin block chain only provides a secure place to store the hash, so you can verify the contents you get from them or other sources have not been altered.
=== Nerdy stuff ===
(1) How distributed torrent networks do it is by each node picking a random address the same length as the hash (256 bits).  Whichever node is "closest" to the data content hash gets to store the location information (list of swarm members or trackers).  Closest is measured by lining up their address and the data hash, and counting the number of bits that are different.
When you join the network, your first connection gives you nodes that are "closer" to your address, until you connect to your "closest" neighbors.  Thus the network self-organizes by address distance.  When you search for torrent data, the same kind of passing your connection closer to the desired address happens, until you get to a node that actually has the data you need.

Money laundering is hiding that the money comes from illegal activity.  Since the Silk Road had legitimate items mixed in with the drugs and stolen credit card numbers, their mixer was hiding that a particular transaction was for buying drugs.
Yes, any time you take out cash from an ATM and spend it, you break the traceability from income to purchases.  But it is a matter of intent.  If you sell drugs and use ten "mules" to deposit the fiat cash in various bank accounts, write checks to ten other accounts, then withdraw the cash again from ATMs from those other accounts, you are money laundering.  The exact same transactions are perfectly legal if you are not trying to hide illegal source income.

Working on it.  Our project is developing distributed manufacturing, where individual machines are linked electronically.  Production orders are linked to bitcoin escrow, and as work gets completed, the funds are released.  We call it a "MakerNet".
The leverage to make it independent is that the machines can be told to make parts for more machines, including their power sources, and the whole system is automated as much as possible.  If all your physical needs are taken care of by your own machines, and those you trade with, what need for government?

I live in Alabama, and benefit from early development of the state based on slavery.  That doesn't make slavery right.  Neither does extorting money from one group to pay for monopolized education of another group's children.
If people want to voluntarily contribute to general education, fine.  But most taxation is based on extortion (give us money or we will do something worse to you) and is morally wrong, no matter how good a use the money is put to afterwards.  Just because a local gang uses some of their money for charity doesn't make them any more right in running a protection racket to obtain the money.


Have you never heard of computers, and privately hired teachers?  The current education system is insanely expensive because it's a monopoly (teachers unions, administrative overhead, expensive buildings).  Private teachers who have small groups of students, and work out of people's homes eliminates the buildings, school buses, and a lot of other overhead.


Criminals generally don't follow regulations, that's why we call them criminals.  Perhaps you need a different word here.  But to answer your question, monopolies on legal systems are just as inefficient as any other monopoly.  There should be an open market on protective services.  You subscribe to a legal code of your choosing like you subscribe to home-owner's insurance.  If you break the rules of your chosen code, you may be fined or punished *because you agreed to that set of rules*.  You can also choose not to subscribe to any rules, but then people might not want to do business with you.
I would expect most people will choose the same basic rules that have existed throughout history (murder, physical harm, theft, etc. are not allowed), with variations on more minor stuff.  When a case arises between people covered by different legal services providers, their own providers represent the alleged criminal and victim, and an independent arbitrator makes the decision between them (third party provider, or independent professional arbitrator).

The distinction between a community homeowner's association (which already exist) and a small town begins to get thin.  The former collect dues, maintain local roads and playgrounds, and many of the other functions we associate with local government.
You are indeed right that the key distinction is voluntary vs use of force.  When you join a homeowner's association you presumably do so voluntarily by choosing to buy a house in that community.  Governments extract taxes by threat of force.
The US system of Federal, state, and local government already deals with overlapping jurisdictions, so mainly I propose de-monopolizing which ones you deal with by accident of territorial location, and make it choice.  For example, I might be physically in Alabama, but choose to be a member of New Hampshire because I like their system better.

Most people don't realize what a huge activity "offshoring" is.  Offshoring is the movement of assets across national boundaries to gain an advantage.  It doesn't mean the money necessarily *stays* offshore.  For example, the Pritzger family uses an offshore trust and bank they own to save on taxes from their hotel chain, but the actual hotels are mostly in the USA.
If you are in an unstable business or unstable country, moving assets offshore may simply be a way to protect them.  In the case of this story, Chinese officials or the wealthy can fall out of favor.  So stashing some assets overseas is a way to protect them from seizure, for themselves or their family.  If you live in a high inflation country like Argentina or India, a Dollar or Euro investment may be pretty attractive.
Bitcoin coupled with countries that have strong financial privacy is an effective tool for moving assets internationally, but the people who service the rich and powerful (big banks, law firms, and accounting firms) will likely stick to more traditional channels for the most part.  Given that the total offshoring market is ~$20 trillion in value, though, even a tiny fraction transacted in bitcoin would have a significant effect on it.
Banking, legal, and accounting services are pretty high overhead, so using them to offshore has been mostly limited to the wealthy.  The low overhead of bitcoin opens up the possibility of "offshoring for the little guy".  There's a business opportunity there for someone to set up such services.

Initial validation of a transaction takes seconds, while recording it in the block chain takes longer.  The question is what probability of long term confirmation do you want?
Bitcoin nodes compare incoming transactions against their copy of the block chain *and* a memory pool of recently arrived transactions not yet in a block.  If the sending addresses have enough balance to make the transaction, and it passes other tests, it gets relayed to other nodes.  If it does not, it gets rejected.  This happens in a matter of seconds.  If you see an incoming transaction on your personal wallet, or on blockchain.info, you already have a ~99.99% confidence level the transaction is good, as long as you are not getting your info from the sender's node (which they can manipulate)
Incorporation into a block, and then more blocks being created after it, just raises that probability higher.  If you run the canonical convenience store, zero confirmations is sufficient, because the amount is small, and you make lots of them in a day.  The savings over bank fees is much larger than the risk of a double-spend.
If your business is selling furniture, it will generally take more than an hour to deliver it, so you have plenty of time to get 6 confirmations.  So if someone is moaning about 10 minute confirmations, the question is what is their use case, and why is it too long?  How does it compare to existing solutions?  
@_date: 2014-09-13 12:03:59
A good regulation is one that does less harm than good.  Merchants are already protected by bitcoin, because it reduces fees, overhead, fraud, and chargebacks.  Consumers are less well protected when *someone else holds their coins* and *sloppy, untested software is released*.  Those can be useful avenues to pursue.
Examples are ways to prevent third parties from just running away with customer coins, or managing them badly so they get spent or stolen.  Another is independent testing of software.  But the cure can be worse than the disease if the overhead cost from regulation is &gt; expected losses.
A register of companies with "proof of funds", and links to real-time balances, for example, would be a low cost way to give customer confidence.  The bitcoin public ledger makes it easy for anyone to check the balances.
As far as illegal uses, cash is better for being anonymous, it doesn't leave a transaction record.  Any commodity can be used as a substitute.  Here in the U.S. laundry detergent has been used to buy drugs.  At the cartel level, major banks handle their money, and have for decades.  The risk to reward level is just too low and it's easy money for the banks.  
Restricting bitcoin is like placing one sandbag in the face of a flood.  You are better off stopping the source of the flood (demand for drugs, for example).  Like water, trade will find a way to leak through, if there is even one hole.

You are correct.  The early stage MakerNet will be people with conventional tools and maybe one or two automated machines like a CNC Lathe or 3D printer, who communicate via ordinary methods (email, phone, etc.).  Loading of printing/machining files will be manual.  Over time the goal is to upgrade and automate the manual in-between steps.


In the economics sense, scarcity is not having enough to satisfy peoples needs and wants.  This is different than "the ore is rare".  Material scarcity then is not enough food, shelter, utilities, etc.  Our project is not trying to address non-material services and entertainment, people will always want more of those.
As far as the rare minerals, if your factories produce enough mining robots, you can increase their availability, but it's better to design your stuff not to need them in the first place.


An automated factory with general purpose machines won't become obsolete very quickly, but conceptually you run the assembly process for those machines in reverse, and recover their materials to make something else.  You need the dis-assembly process in any case, because that's how you replace worn out parts when they need it.


That's one of the benefits of computer-controlled production.  A CNC lathe can make parts for a variety of products.  It doesn't need to make 1000 copies of the same thing.  The production is organized by type of materials (metal, wood, plastic, etc.).  So while you may change the production mix, you are not going to stop using metal in all your items.


We call that item the "process compiler".  Since the factory constantly changes by making more machines for itself, as well as end products for other people, you need a way to re-plan your production flows.  Software compilers take high level code, and convert it to low level instructions for a target machine.  Similarly, the process compiler will take digital design files as input, and convert it to low level tasks and schedules, based on what equipment is in the factory.


One of the things I want to do is use virtual/augmented reality for factory layout and simulating production flows in the actual factory.  Instead of just a game, people can then control real robots and machines remotely, and get things made when they are not physically there in person.

Actually, energy is the key to ending scarcity.  Every finished material or product has an "embodied energy" - the sum of all the energy needed to make it, from raw materials, through all the production steps.  That includes powering the computers and robots if you automate the production.
If you have an abundance of energy sources, then you can run everything, including making more energy sources.  Sources like wind, solar, and biofuels are by their nature distributed.  Others, like large scale hydroelectric and fossil fuels, occur in specific locations, so they tend to end up with centralized production and big distribution systems.
Certain energy sources, like solar furnaces, have particularly short "energy payback times" - how long it takes to make enough energy to copy themselves.  So the fastest growth path is to build those first, then expand out to other products and energy sources.
Even with automated production, you need different skills and equipment for different tasks, so you end up with a network of people trading with each other for their various needs.

What I actually expect as the most likely result is to scan the frozen brain at a microscopic level, to map out all the neurons and synapses.  Then replicate that structure in suitable software.  Give the person a robot body, and they are good to go.  People refer to this as "uploading".
Why I think it is likely is we already have scanning tunneling microscopes that can resolve at an atomic level.  Other than being tedious and requiring a lot of data storage, you can scan a frozen brain one atomic layer at at time today, ablating a layer away between scans.  This process is testable on animals before trying it on people, and we are making good progress on modeling neurons in software.

Nope.  In the days when Stealth technology was a secret, we engineers figured out that Boeing was working on it, because a new building at our plant was built with double walls.  The only reason to do that is to install an electromagnetic shield (Faraday cage) around the inner wall.  This was later confirmed when talking to people working inside on the phone, and the lines go dead between words.  Apparently the lines disconnect when not in use, to prevent signals from going in or out on the wires.
Electromagnetic shields are commonly used in testing satellite and radar antennas, to prevent interference.  But those are just around the test chamber.  You only shield the whole building (offices and bathrooms, as well as industrial areas) when you want to prevent any signals leaking out, meaning you are serious about security.

The market price of one unit (a bitcoin) depends on demand to move money through the Bitcoin Network from one place to another.  The Network consists of all the nodes that relay transactions, miners, the block chain, and all the software and apps associated with it.
In order to use the Network, you have to control some of the units (bitcoins) so you can send them.  Since the supply is finite, more demand to move money results in a higher price for the units.
So what you really are asking is "will demand to use the Network grow faster than the supply of units?".  Most people here on will say yes, because 
(a) we think the Bitcoin Network has definite advantages over other ways to move money (Western Union, PayPal, banking networks, briefcase full of $100 bills, gold coins), and
(b) the number of people who have adopted bitcoin so far is small relative to the eventual number that can adopt it.
The downsides are governments and banks can ban dealing with bitcoins, restricting it's use, a fatal flaw could be found in how bitcoin works, or a better way to move money can be developed.  In those cases, demand, and thus unit price, will fall.
You shouldn't blindly invest based on forum comments.  One rule of investing is "don't invest in something you don't understand".  Try to read up on it and understand how it works, what advantages it offers, what the risks are, etc.  Form your own opinion, then decide.
If I had to put bitcoin in a category, I would call it a "speculative high-risk/high potential return commodity".  It's sort of like wildcat oil well drilling or gold prospecting.  You could strike it rich, or end up with worthless dirt and a hole in the ground.  It's too early to tell.

Apparently you haven't tried to use county records.  
* Transactions related to a given property are not linked, so tracing the chain of ownership takes a lot of work.  A blockchain explicitly references previous transaction outputs, so it is easy to trace.  Records are divided across thousands of county courthouses, each of which may use a different system.
* Buying fractional ownership of a property takes just as much paperwork as buying a whole lot, so it is rarely done.  Even buying whole properties has so much overhead that people delay buying and selling.  A block chain system would reduce overhead and enable new ways of buying and selling properties.
* County records are at risk of destruction, because only one or a few copies exist.  A distributed record system with many copies is more secure.  Counties don't validate transactions, they merely record them for a fee - either scanning or adding the physical paper to a record book.  So it is fairly possible to fake a transaction, or record one of questionable validity.  That's one reason title insurance exists.  Digitally signed transactions with a private key are better proof.

My suggestion is to double the block size hard limit every time the mining reward halves.  This allows miners to gradually replace decreasing rewards with increasing transaction fees, and is a simple and predictable schedule.  Thus the limit would go to 2 MB in about two years, then 4 MB in about 6 years.  It works out to a 19% average annual rate.

Creating a network that can efficiently move money, however, adds value by reducing economic overhead and friction.  The market price per bitcoin indicates the demand to use the network at a given point in time.  The underlying value of the network comes from growth in the number of merchants, network nodes, software improvements, etc.
It's not as easy to measure the growth of the network's value as for a single company.  Bitcoin's network is distributed over many people and businesses.  But the demand to use the network, and thus the bitcoin exchange rate, is a proxy indicator for that underlying value.

A few examples: land in the Australian outback can have a negative value.  Thus a house with no land is worth more than the same house with large acreage.  The reason is the government obligations that come with the land are higher than anything the land can produce.
In the U.S., a severely toxic site can have a negative value.  The owner will pay you to take it off their hands.  The reason is the clean-up costs are greater than the land would be worth once cleaned, and they can't sell it for any other purpose until it is cleaned.

By minimizing the time you hold bitcoin.  For example, you use Circle to buy bitcoins instantly to remit. Your family in the other country can go to a local bitcoin agent's office to pick up their local currency.  They are only exposed to volatility for as long as it takes them to exchange back.  We don't yet have an agent network like [Western Union]( (500,000 agents &amp; 100,000 ATMs worldwide).  That will take time to build.
With increased use, the exchange rate for bitcoin will settle down.  The more buyers and sellers, the less effect any individual decision to buy or sell makes.  So people will be more comfortable holding the coins for a while.  For now, most people in less developed nations will want to convert, because there are not so many places to spend bitcoin directly in their area.

When Mt.Gox opened, the total value of all the bitcoins in the world was about $240,000.  An amateur exchange based on trading role-playing game cards was an entirely appropriate level of effort at the time.  But the total market value of bitcoins has grown by a factor of 30,000 since then, and they failed to scale up their level of professionalism to match.
The warning signs have been there all along.  Every time there was a spike in trading volume, or new customers signing up, their systems have not been able to keep up.  I deeply sympathize with all the people who had money stuck in Mt.Gox.  It will likely take years to get anything back, and that will only be a fraction of what they put in.  
I suffered a similar event from a mutual fund (Morgan Keegan, then owned by Regions Bank) that invested in mortgage-backed securities in 2007, and fraudulently misrepresented what they had invested in and the value.  Two of the three class actions still have not settled (separate ones were brought by US state attorney generals, the SEC, and a private class action for a total of $265 million in settlements vs $1.3 billion in losses).  All I can suggest is to be patient, this is gonna take a while.  
Because the money came from all over the world, I expect there to be multiple legal cases.  I had to file claims in all three of the settlements I'm involved with, and would recommend to Mt.Gox customers to keep an eye out for the same kind of thing.  Take action to preserve any records you have for the long term.

Whoever a court says fits that text is supposed to get a license.  That's going to be pretty unenforceable because miners, nodes, and code contributors are all over the world.

OK, you asked for it.  I see cryptocurrencies as an instance of the wider trend towards decentralized and automated systems which are bringing about an end to scarcity.

Money transmission systems were scarce and expensive, and cryptocurrencies are creating new ones that are much more available at low cost to everyone.  
In the near future, physical goods will be producible in bountiful amounts by distributed automated systems.

I have actual experience that backs this up.  The Second Life virtual world has had a frictionless, convertible currency since the early 2000's.  The Linden Dollar converts at 257L$/USD, so about 0.4 US cents is the minimum transaction.  I and thousands of other people make and sell digital content, and do other things in that world, for mostly small amounts per transaction.  There is no user-to-user transaction fee, because it's all on Linden Lab's (Second Life's operator) database.
Most of the items I sell are priced at L$ 250, just under a dollar, which seems to be a sweet spot for impulse buys.  But I have at times had items as low as $L 1, and I have been paid L$ 250,000 (1000 USD) to build an entire custom map region for a real-life executive. Custom work where you only sell one copy is priced much higher.
Within Second Life there is no extra setup to do stuff for money, every user can pay any other user directly, because the money system is built into the software you log in with.  I think that is key to widespread adoption.  We need something like a built-in money system in a web browser, where paying a website is "right click &gt; context menu &gt; Pay Site &gt; popup window for amount to send".  No log-ins, registration, setting up accounts.  That's too much friction.

The simple answer is "about 100,000 people at any given moment" - 


Those same 100,000 people (or the software they are running, actually), who check to make sure only the allowed amount of new coins are generated.  The formula in excel form is:
New coins/block = 50/POWER(2, ((ROUNDDOWN(Block height/210,000)))
If someone tries to generate a different number of new coins, every single copy of the software rejects the block of transactions containing the attempt.

Agreed.  The value of the coins mined/earned at the time are business income, from which you can subtract costs to determine net income.  For mining you can depreciate your own hardware, and a portion of your internet costs if you were in a pool.  If you sold goods and services, their cost is applied like for any other business.

I'm entirely serious.  The commons are called the commons because they are "used in common", and not the private property of any single person.  In the original example it referred to the common grazing land of a medieval village.  
Each villager has an incentive to graze more livestock on the commons, because they gain the benefit of fatter animals without any cost.  However if everyone does that, the fields become overgrazed and less productive.  That's the tragedy.  Actual historical villages had rules to limit the use of shared resources like grazing land and surrounding forests.  They understood what would happen if they didn't limit use.
As an economic theory, it describes what can happen when there is an asymmetry in gains and costs.  If the gains accrue to individuals, but the costs accrue to everyone in general, the individual has a large incentive for that action.  Their share of the costs are small, so the gains minus costs for them is very positive.  However if everyone else does the same thing, now the costs from everyone else can add up to more than the individual gain.
A non-farming example are import tariffs, like the one just imposed on Chinese solar panels.  US solar manufacturers gain the benefit of reduced competition for their product.  But everyone else (panel buyers, installers, etc.) suffers from the higher cost.  If tariffs are imposed on every product, now everyone suffers higher cost on everything imported, with no general gain except for the government who collects the tariff.

Signals intelligence (SigInt) is why the NSA was founded in the first place.  They got their start tapping undersea telegraph cables, in the days when important messages traveled that way.

Once you have the raw data, then you decode it and sift it to look for important information.  The sifting is where all the other databases come in.

I don't own a TV, and don't pay much attention to popular media, so I miss out on many popular memes, no worries.
I agree that governments in general will attempt to hold onto their power.  That's just what people in power do.  I'm working on developing self-expanding automation (  ), where part of the production output is fed back to making more equipment.  Thus a starter kit (a Seed Factory) can grow to whatever size you need.
If such a device supplies you with the basic necessities (food, shelter, utilties) as outputs, you don't need to work a job, or can work less.  Thus you will have less cash income, and the government would have less to tax.  A single machine in your garage won't be able to make all the stuff you need, so a more practical approach is a "Distributed Production Network", where various farms and greenhouses supply the food, workshops make furniture, etc.  All automated, with shared ownership by the people who use the products.
No money is changing hands, it's just an overgrown version of a backyard garden and garage workshop.  This allows people to "pull out of the system" and greatly reduce their tax burden.  Automated production won't do everything, people still want services, and service providers want to get paid, so some paid work or sales of surplus products will be needed for that.  But if you can make 70 or 80% yourself, that drops you into a much lower tax bracket based on a lower cash income.

That's both the derivation and definition in English for centuries "A landlord is the owner of a house, apartment, condominium, land or real estate which is rented or leased to an individual or business, who is called a tenant"


Those are called "property managers".  In the non-English speaking world the terms may be different, but we are using English here, as spoken in the UK, USA, etc.


That's "Gross Rent" - total money collected from tenants


Income after expenses is called "Net Income", and that is what is commonly used to calculate rate of return on the investment, because that is what you get to keep.  Net Income divided by original purchase price is what I quoted at 6%.


Often commercial real estate in the US is bought under a large mortgage, such as 70 to 80%.  In that case, you have a large interest expense, but any increase in the property value (land + buildings) is magnified, because you only put a fraction of the price at purchase.
The total return in that case consists of whatever net income is left after all expenses, including interest, the accumulation of ownership as the loan principal is paid off, and any change in the value of the property.  The return can vary wildly in that case.  I was quoting the return in the simple case of no mortgage, and only net income from rents.

Imagine a notaries network, that records document hashes on a block chain to verify they existed at a particular time, and what the content was.  The notaries who use the network have an incentive to mine blocks because their business is based on provable records.  The notaries collect fees from customers, so they don't have to earn income from running the network (i.e mining).  Instead they run mining nodes, or subscribe to such nodes, and treat it as a business expense.

First, get the facts straight.  The units mismatch was between contractor Lockheed Martin (English) and NASA (Metric).   
Second, I tested software for the Space Station.  The test group was three times the size of the coder group.  It was very important not to kill astronauts or destroy the Station by means of software bugs, so we had a rigorous development process.  The test suite tested every kind of input error (like a valve sensor simultaneously reading open and closed - there are sensors for both positions).  
But that kind of software development isn't cheap.  The software group as a whole was 100 people at the peak, and we had a test lab with about two dozen racks of computer hardware.  Since the Station was never all put together until it reached orbit, we had to simulate most of it and make the computers think they were talking to Station hardware.
Given that bitcoin is now worth billions, I think Gavin is entirely correct that more effort should be going into updating and testing the core software.  Since it's open source, what we can do is encourage bigger companies to devote developer time, and smaller ones to contribute proportional funding to paying developers.  As individual users, we can ask a company what they are doing to support core development, and make choices about where to take our business partly on that basis.  
It really is in the self-interest of people building on top of the bitcoin network to contribute to core development.  Just like with buildings, if the foundation is bad, what you build on top of it will fall down.

I'm quite libertarian in philosophy.  I'm not an expert on Marx' philosophy, so I don't know if he advocated single party rule, but I do know that Communist Parties have not been socialist paradises for their countries.  Marxist theory and human nature seem to be at odds.
The aim of the Seed Factory Project (  ) is open-source distributed development of the technology and prototypes.  The technology and designs would be freely distributed, while the physical instances of the hardware would be privately owned.
What makes our work different than conventional automation is to design the equipment to make more of itself, beginning with a starter kit (the seed).  When your production capacity gets mature enough, you can output more seed kits, much like living plants do.  Thus a starter kit can grow exponentially.
This approach doesn't require government handouts like a "basic income".  Instead, individuals or small groups get together and build one or more of the devices in the starter kit.  They can trade outputs across a "distributed production network", and use a cryptocurrency like bitcoin to settle payments to each other, or to buy shares in each other's production outputs.  For example, I need to eat, so I might buy a share in an automated greenhouse to get a steady supply of food.
Some nodes in the network might grow to be complete factories in time, but to start with they would be single or small sets of equipment and owners who trade.  High levels of automation doesn't hurt people in that case, because they own the automation.  In contrast, when a large corporation automates, they get rid of the workers as an unnecessary expense.
We are still at an early stage of the project.  In fact I'm organizing a technical library for the project, and surfing reddit and tech news sites in between while Adobe Acrobat converts and optimizes the files.  We can't do good design without good data to work from.

There is no such thing as "intrinsic value".  Each person values things differently, and the same person values things differently at different times.  I value a hamburger more than the cash in my pocket when I am hungry, and less when I am not.  McDonalds always values my cash more than their hamburgers.  If they did not, they would not be in the hamburger business.
Market prices are determined by the balance of people who want a particular item vs. the people willing to give up that item for something else.  Since that balance can change over time, so does the market price.  Outside events can change how much people want an item.  For example, the land over the Bakken oil formation used to be only used for grain farming and pasturage.  Once frakking and directional drilling became feasible, the land now has higher value for oil production.

Confirmation is not the same as relayed across the network.  Each network node checks incoming transactions against the block chain and the memory pool of recent transactions not yet in a block.  If there is not enough balance, the transaction is not relayed to other nodes.  Relaying takes a few seconds.
Attempted double-spends, including accidentally trying to spend out of an address without enough balance, run about 1 in 10,000 currently.  Actual double-spends are lower than this.  So the risk for a retail merchant making a small sale is pretty low, and much lower than credit card fraud.
Confirmations average ~10 minutes/block, and reduce the risk a lot lower than 1 in 10,000, because the chances of a different block with the other transaction ending up in the "main chain" are small.  Each added block reduces the risk of an alternate chain becoming the main chain by a further factor.  
So for a big purchase, it is wise to wait for a few confirmations. But for convenience store/gas station/restaurants, where they process hundreds of sales per day, the risk of someone double-spending is too small to worry about.

Dumb bitch.  The first sentence of the Federal Reserve Act (the bill that established the Federal Reserve):


Nope, the fiat dollar was rubbery right from the start, they could stretch it as much as they wanted.  For people not familiar with century-old monetary policy, elastic in this context meant "not limited by the availability of silver and gold".  The United States was growing rapidly at the time, and there was a concern there would not be enough physical coins to serve personal and business needs.  Paper notes were to be issued to member banks on request, in exchange for suitable collateral (and still are).
Private bank notes issued by individual banks were subject to bank runs (redeeming all the notes for gold) when people thought there was not enough gold in their vaults to cover them.  The district Federal Reserve banks were not subject to bank runs, because the public can't do business with them.  While individual banks could still fail, fiat dollars as a whole continued to circulate.

What's a UPS truck backed by?  Nothing, it has "utility value" in itself.  It performs something useful that people value, namely delivering packages.  Similarly the Bitcoin Network performs something useful that people value, namely recording transactions between people.  Since it has utility value, it does not need backing by anything else.
The "bitcoin" currency unit is just a unit of measure for transactions on the block chain, like the "meter" is a unit of measure for length.  It doesn't need backing any more than the troy ounce used to measure gold does.  The block chain and the Network that records new transactions is what has the value.

You really think a little ribbon has any effect compared to the tidal acceleration caused by the whole Earth?  The Earth rotates faster than the Moon orbits.  Therefore the tides generated by the Moon move ahead of the line connecting the centers.  These tides happen in rock as well as the oceans.
When you treat the Earth as round + a bulge gravitationally, that bulge is pulling the Moon forward in its orbit.  This is raising the Moon's orbit, and at the same time slowing the Earth's rotation.  Both effects have been measured.


When you ask a question like this, you need to consider how big an effect is involved, and how big is it compared to other things already happening.

I don't know if Cord Shoes does it, but one aspect is fit.  I used to make shoes for medieval re-enactments, and basically each one was a unique project - one person wanted one particular design, in their size.  So I made patterns directly from their feet.  Those fit better than shoes made for generic feet of a given size, even though various lengths and widths are commercially available.
I can second the repairability point.  I had a pair of commercial dress shoes that I wore for work.  The soles wear out a lot faster than the uppers, so I was able to resole them three times before the uppers were in too bad shape to use.
A third point is that leather shoes, even if not custom made for your feet, will stretch over time.  They are made of animal skin, and skin is elastic.  So after a while they will conform to your feet, and be more comfortable.  Synthetics don't do that, or not as well.

Electricity had manifold changes.  For example, when factories were run by a big steam engine with belts and pulleys to distribute power, the buildings were more cube-shaped to minimize distance.  With electrical distribution, factories could be on single floor, which made moving stuff around easier, leading to assembly lines.
Conversely, electric streetcars, railways, subways, and elevators allowed for massively centralized cities.  Electric lighting, of course, allowed night work, and staying up later in the home, but that was just one impact.  It took many years for the other impacts to play out fully.

I bought shares in a bond fund then run by Regions Bank.  They lied about the market value of the MBS they held in the fund, and failed to tell us they were lower "tranches" (priority of getting repaid).  Beyond that, the ratings agencies mis-rated the securities (because they were being paid by the issuer to get a rating), and the loans themselves often had inflated appraisals and low quality borrowers.
I reviewed the history of the fund, and the mix of investments they had (it was not all MBS's).  They claimed to be a "diversified bond fund", but they concentrated in low quality MBS's to the tune of 65% of their total assets in order to chase yield, and leveraged their purchases by 30% (the fund itself borrowed money to buy the securities).  Effectively they changed from a diversified fund to a MBS fund, without informing us.  Unfortunately the market imploded before we could find this out in the next semi-annual report.
So yeah, I did reasonable due-diligence, but there were a multitude of facts that were just not available to investors, and actual fraud involved.  Regions is paying $265 million from three class actions because of the lack of disclosure and fraud.  That only covers 20% of investor losses, but it's better than nothing.

At first there will be manual steps in the process.  For example, if you want a piece of wood furniture, the lumber list would go to the lumber yard, and the furniture plans would go to the woodworking shop.  Shipping the lumber would start out going the usual way (human loads a truck, it drives over to the wood shop).  
Over time you can automate that step - robot at the lumber yard loads self-driving vehicle.  Another robot at the woodworking shop unloads the vehicle and stores the lumber until it is ready to cut.
Internal transport (inside a location, between machines, and to and from storage), and external transport (between locations) is definitely part of the system concept, but you don't have to automate everything at once.  You do it incrementally, starting with the core machines.
Automation doesn't mean 100% automated, that's very hard.  There will still be people involved.  But for example, a robotic greenhouse can grow a lot of food with a few people to manage it.  If you need a repair part, one of the humans can order it from the automated machine shop which built the original robot, sending over enough bitcoins to cover the cost.

The confusion comes from the word "coin" in the bitcoin name, which immediately makes people think of the kind of coins you put in your pocket.  What needs to be explained repeatedly is bitcoin is a payment network first, that happens to have its own internal accounting unit.  But without the network, bitcoins as accounting units can't be moved from person to person, so you can't think of them as separate things.
The analogy I make is that UPS shipping labels by themselves are just sticky labels that don't do much.  It is only as part of a network of trucks and distribution terminals that the labels become something worth paying for.
Once you consider bitcoin as a payment network first, and currency unit second, you can then compare it to other payment networks (Western Union, PayPal, VISA) and derive a value based how well it does the job of moving money.  That is separate from the value as a scarce collectible item like bars of gold or fine art.  Utility as a service vs. scarcity are very different categories.

Automation and robotics can't be killed, it is too much a part of modern civilization already.  The only thing I am doing is directing part of the outputs back into more parts to expand production, and optimizing the design to incorporate such self-made expansions.  That is design information, which cannot be stopped or prohibited.  I'm making it open source, and you can't stop an idea once it has spread.
Our project goal is a complete prototype factory, capable of producing parts for self-expansion and eventually new starter kits.  To get there, we will need to build and test components, and then whole machines.  In turn, to build those items, you need a conventional workshop with lathes, hydraulic presses, and similar machines, and money to buy parts and materials you can't make yourself.  That's the R&amp;D workshop.  At first we will use existing "maker" community shops, that have welding rigs, 3D printers, etc. already working, until we can get our own workshop set up.
We are a distributed open-source project, so people are welcome to work on items on their own or in local groups.  Our R&amp;D location will just be dedicated to the project and on a larger scale than most people will do.  We will share our design data with the world, and make use of other open source hardware when it makes sense.  I'm also happy to use commercial automation and robotics technology if it works well.

Apparently congressional staffers don't do math


Incorrect, the Block Chain provides very good measurement of velocity


Incorrect.  Transactions are checked against the block chain by nodes and relayed in seconds.  Inclusion in a block reduces the chances of a double-spend, but it is already below 0.01% after propagating across the network, because nodes will reject a second transaction trying to spend the same balance.  Confirmations do not vary in time by size of the transaction.  They vary by the transaction fee offered, and how certain the seller wants to be that the transaction is final.  Also, blocks are generated randomly, so there is no minimum time per confirmation, only an average.


I think they meant "lower in the future", but in any case this neglects that the majority of merchants use a payment processor or sell their bitcoins on the market, and adjust BTC prices in real time to their desired local currency price using software.


Factually incorrect, the price peaked at $265 on April 10th on the Mt. Gox exchange.  Outside of a 4 day period it stayed below $160
In general I find the report weak on the facts and implications, because the staffers rely on information provided by others, and the others they chose seem to be mostly the usual policy/government types, rather than businesses and individuals actually using bitcoin, or people who have a deep understanding of how it works (i.e. developers).  There is no mention of ongoing software improvements by core developers, other associated software and custom hardware, little consideration of competing cryptocurrencies, or implications of using the chained-hash type record-keeping for other purposes than payment transactions.

That's a good idea.  If you can figure out how to put bids in escrow, and when a higher bid arrives return the previous bid, you may have a winner.  Seller doesn't have to worry the auction winner won't pay, because it's in escrow.  Buyer doesn't have to worry about getting ripped off, because the funds are not released to the seller until delivery.

The Block Chain records every bitcoin transaction since the Genesis Block in 2009.  Therefore it keeps growing in size.  For the average user, it may become too large to store (at 20 GB, it may already be too large for some users).  The current software limit is 1 MB/block, which can hold about 2500 transactions, or 4/second.  That's not high enough for a worldwide financial network.
There are a number of approaches to handling these limitations.  Instead of storing the Block Chain on your home PC, you could subscribe to a server at a data center, along with other people.  That would split the cost, and the server can have more storage and bandwidth.  As long as there are enough independent copies of the block chain, the distributed verification isn't compromised.
You can prune the Block Chain of all addresses which have zero balances, since only non-zero balances can generate new transactions.  Services can handle "off-chain" transactions, where it is internal to their books.  You have to trust the service in that case.  Side or branch chains can also move transactions off the main Block Chain.
The 1 MB limit is a software limit, it could be increased.  However, more transactions per second will require more bandwidth for network nodes.
If bitcoin keeps getting more popular, eventually one or more of the above ideas, or new ones I haven't heard of yet, will be required.  The alternative is bitcoin will become a service similar to how banks settle check clearing with each other.  They do clearing once a day, with many individual checks going in both directions being bundled together, and one net payment between them for settlement.

When you calculate market penetration, you have to define the relevant market.  For smartphones, one is as a percentage of all mobile phones.  In the U.S. smartphones went through early adoption very rapidly (about three years).  Worldwide it took about [7-8 years]( for smartphone penetration to reach 20%, which puts it into the mainstream.
You are quoting numbers for iPhones, but they are not the only smartphone, merely one brand.  Brand is irrelevant for market penetration.  We would not quote how many merchants Coinbase has for bitcoin "merchant adoption", we would count all payment processors plus merchants who take it directly.

I feel for them.  My mother's family is from that area and they still mostly live there.  I was born there, after the *second* Arab-Israeli war, and my parents thought it wise to get the heck out.  Thus I grew up in New York City.
What I know of Middle-Eastern culture, both from personal experience and studying history, is extended family/tribal ties are stronger than in Western culture, and people can hold grudges for many generations.  This was true in early Northern European culture too, in the days of Germanic and Celtic tribes.
Westerners have had a cultural shift to settling disputes and crimes by legal processes, instead of family vendetta.  Despite having some of the oldest cities on Earth in that area, identification with nations and laws as participatory rather than imposed is culturally recent.  There have always been rulers in the Middle East, but they were (and are) imposed from above, while more local affiliations are preserved underneath.

That depends on three things:
* Is what is being offered a "security"?  In simple terms, a security is the right to collect profits from the work of others.  Thus shares of stock and bonds are generally securities.
* Is it being offered to US residents?  The SEC doesn't have jurisdiction outside the US.
* Is the offering exempt from registration?  The most common exemptions are for small amounts, small number of investors, or only offering within a single US state.  However, you may still fall under your state securities laws, even if exempt from SEC registration.
The above is a vast simplification.  Securities law is complex and technical.

Yes, if the Block Chain is used for clearing between processors.  Each block chain transaction then represents many individual user transactions.  As an example, Coinbase arranges with BitPay to make one payment every ten minutes representing all the Coinbase wallet users' purchases with BitPay merchants over that interval.  They separately send a list of which destination addresses get how much.
The reason processors will adopt such an approach is it will save them transaction fees.  Instead of 0.0002 BTC fee x 1000 transactions, it will be 0.0002 fee x 1 transaction.  BitPay could guarantee payment to the merchant account immediately, since they would get BTC every ten minutes, and they only deposit fiat to the merchant account daily.

As someone who lost money due to Morgan Keegan's mutual fund fraud, it was several stages of deception:
Mortgages were packaged into "tranches", where a group of loans were sliced horizontally into "first to be repaid"...."last to be repaid".  The last tranches were much riskier than the underlying real estate, because they were the last to get any payments.  Mortgage securities are supposed to reduce risk by pooling loans.  Some loans always default, but 90+% don't, so in a pool you get the average return.  Tranches put things back in the same condition as before you pooled the loans.  Some tranches get fully paid off, but the last tranches get all the losses.
Next, the credit ratings firms pretty much lied about the risk of a given tranche.  They were putting AAA ratings on things that should have been in the "junk bond" category.  Lastly, the mutual funds that bought these junk loans didn't tell the investors that they were holding low priority tranches which were highly likely to lose money.  In the case of Morgan Keegan, the fund manager deliberately altered the valuation of the bonds, to hide the fact the market was discovering just how bad they were.  As a result, the SEC, several states, and a class action suit (3 separate litigations) are collecting $265 million in penalties from Morgan Keegan's former owner, Colonial Bank.  Unfortunately that is only about 20% of the losses investors like myself sustained.
My personal example was repeated throughout the industry, and when the housing bubble burst and the recession hit, anyone holding large amounts of these junk bonds lost lots of money.  That includes many large banks, who were holding these bonds as interest-earning assets.

As someone who spent a career in the space industry, I have to comment on this.  Only a government would be so insane as to build $1000/kg aerospace hardware and throw it away after one use.  They can do that because **it's not their money, it's your money**.  
Most of the private space projects are planning to use the hardware multiple times, for the same reason we use airplanes multiple times - it becomes too expensive to run a business otherwise.  So it's not that private space programs took a long time to develop.  They are happening when the market and technology allows for a business to make a profit.

No, the increase in the money supply happened when a bank makes the mortgage.  They issue a loan check, which gets deposited by someone.  In return they have the loan owed by the borrower as an asset.  So their books balance.
But the total deposits in the banking system have increased.  The lending bank's depositors think they have money in the bank, but so does the home seller, who didn't before.
When the Fed buys a mortgage from that bank, the bank's total assets don't change.  They merely exchange a loan asset for cash (or a positive balance in their account at the Fed, which is effectively the same thing).  "Vault cash" owned by the bank itself isn't part of the M1 money supply, because it's not in circulation.  If the bank has reached their maximum loan amount (determined by reserve requirements), they can't loan out that cash - it has to stay in the vault as reserves.

I recognize the need for dispute resolution.  For the work I am doing now, we still have the existing legal system.  For a highly automated future with cryptocurrencies as the dominant payment mechanism we would certainly have worked out such a system.  I can't predict what will be adopted, but I can offer a possibility.
[Performance bonds]( have been around since 2750 B.C. for the kind of situation you are asking about.  A third party insures the client (typically a real estate developer) against failure of the contractor to properly complete the work.  The contractor pays for the bond.  For something on the scale of a dining table, where a furniture maker may have many other projects in work, we might ask them to demonstrate a general performance bond covering all work in progress.  If for some reason they go out of business, the insurer pays all the customers back, or if it is cheaper, pays someone else to complete the unfinished work.

The huge increase in bitcoin exchange rate was an incentive to set up commercial mining farms.  The growth in hash rate has resulted in a 10-20% higher production of coins compared to the nominal 3,600 per day.  
Commercial mining farms have to cover their hardware and utility bills, which are very large.  Therefore they sell their coins to cover expenses.  I used to mine with a graphics card I already had, and in the winter at least the extra heat helped keep this room warm.  So no hardware cost, and minimal electric bill increase.  I just kept my coins as a bet on the future.
Thus the rise of mining farms displaced small miners who could afford to hold, and put more new coins on the market.  Increased hash rates increased the supply a bit more.  Market value of the coins increased 40 times.  Combining everything, the dollar value of new coins being sold probably increased by a factor of 100.  
It takes a while for the daily demand to catch up to the increased supply.  Until it does, there is downward pressure on the exchange rate.  This pressure is separate from the dynamics of more merchants and people more willing to spend their coins.

Don't know about issuing your own colored coins, there might be compatibility problems rolling your own.  Also, the NASDAQ understand securities laws, which still have to be followed for issuing stock.
What I imagine might be their mechanism is that stock certificates will still be issued as they always have.  The colored coins just become tokens tagged to particular serial-numbered certificates.  You can then trade the colored coins or fractions thereof instead of the actual certificates, and they can stay in the vault.
Most, but not all, stock certificates these days stay in the vaults of the Depository Trust Corporation, which was set up specifically to ease trading.  Brokers hold an "undivided interest" in the certificates for their customers.  When people buy and sell, it's a bookkeeping operation to update how many shares each broker is assigned.  The share certificates themselves don't move.
The problem is there are still some physical stock certificates out there, and trading has to accomodate them.  Otherwise settlement could be as fast as a computer can update a database.

Corruption can happen any time control of assets is separated from ownership of assets.  Thus if you own a home, and want to add a room, but need a building permit, control is in the hands of the permit office.  Therefore the building official has the opportunity to collect a bribe to allow the work to be done.
The solution here is to remove control from the government official, where they have the power to approve or deny the work.  You can still require that plans be submitted, and that they be stamped by a licensed engineer or architect for safety, but once that is done, the official doesn't get to deny the work on a whim, and therefore can't collect a bribe on that threat.
What kind of money is used to pay the bribe, whether cash in a paper bag, taking the official out to dinner, or bitcoins, is immaterial.  In China, party officials get to buy a home at a discount in return for "smoothing the path" for the construction company.  So there is not even currency coming in, just less going out.  In the U.S. there have been cases of free work done on an official's home, so no money transfer involved.  These were not building officials, rather higher elected ones.  Ironically they were caught because of the permits issued for the work done - that left a paper trail.

The only way to sign bitcoin transactions is with the "private key" paired to a given address.  Without the key, you can't spend your coins. Wallet files are just containers for the keys, one per address.  The key can also be written down, since it's only 256 bits of data, or 64 characters in hexadecimal (base 16).  "Written down" can also mean printed as a QR code, engraved on a slab of stainless steel, etc.  The distinction is "not on a computer that can be hacked".
"Hardware wallets" are a different way to get security.  They are typically a USB device custom made to store keys and generate transactions.  When you are not using it, you unplug it and put it in a safe place.

The particular application here sucks, but the general idea has merit.
Bitcoin harnesses distributed computing to do something useful (maintain the block chain) and pays people for the work.  There may be other useful things that distributed computing can tackle for pay.
One that I know of are render farms.  Computer graphics rendered videos are very computationally intense if you want high quality and large frame sizes.  A render farm is just a big cluster of computers dedicated to that task.  Because graphics rendering is highly parallel, the work can be distributed across a network.  Individuals could be paid in BTC per frame completed similar to how mining pools work.
What's needed is a way to distribute the work and payments to the pool, and to handle multiple jobs.  Bitcoin mining runs forever, but graphics rendering or other compute tasks have a finite amount of work and then need to switch to something else.

Obviously yes, but technology can change the economics of scale.  For example, a farm cooperative that uses robot tractors can directly supply food to the coop members, and the planning on what to grow can be automated based on member inputs.  You then can save on middleman overhead and profit, and transportation costs, and the product will be fresher because it is closer to the users, and better tasting because it doesn't have to be bred to survive shipping.  A robot tractor would be the same size as a conventional tractor.
Some items won't scale to local production, like making integrated circuits, but other things will scale and adapt to distributed methods quite well.

The level of emotions I think is more related to the amount of change and fear the technology represents.  Some people like novelty (I'm one of them), and other people hate change.  A big change then will generate both positive and negative emotions.  Since money is fundamental to how a capitalist society functions, bitcoin represents a big change.
The strong negative reactions some people have to bitcoin may come from this line of thinking: "bitcoin may destroy the dollar and governments.  My savings and pension are based on dollars and the government.  Therefore bitcoin is a threat and I must oppose it."

Perhaps in the future you can 3D-scan customer's feet, and use that to generate the pattern pieces for the leather.  What I used to do (in the days before computer-driven everything) was make a cloth mock-up that they could try on, then use that as the pattern for the leather.  Sometimes they wanted lightweight or dance shoes, and the cloth upper was the finished part of the shoe, with just the soles and a few other parts in leather.  These shoes were typically worn only occasionally for re-enactment events, so long-term durability was not as important compared to what you are doing.

One theory is the NSA is responsible for *creating* bitcoin.  First of all, it has very sophisticated use of hashes and cryptography, and nobody employs more of the right kind of mathematicians  and computer scientists than them.  In addition to clandestine funding, bitcoin provides a full history of transactions.  The NSA has all the other databases (phone records, emails, etc.) to compare those transactions to.  Nobody else has the other databases on the same scale.  That gives the NSA an advantage in tracing money laundering, terrorist funding, etc. if the bad guys switch from cash to digital currencies.  They don't even have to mine the coins, just gather a copy of the block chain like everyone else.
This is just a theory, and I'm open to proof it is false, but it seems to fit the facts as we know them.

Just because customers can't withdraw, doesn't mean *they* can't on their own account.  With the huge difference between the Mt.Gox buy price and other exchanges, they could buy their own customer's BTC on their own exchange, send them to another exchange, and sell for a big profit.  Then send the fiat back to Mt.Gox and repeat.  It's basically a license to print money.
When the Gox price was higher than the rest of the market, they could have been doing the reverse.  Just because customer cash withdrawals were slow, doesn't prevent them from doing wire transfers for themselves.  Take the money out, put it in another exchange, and buy cheap coins to sell to their own customers at inflated prices.
Even if they have lost a lot of money from malleability or other technical problems (not to mention US government seizures), they would have been able to cover the losses and manipulate prices to profit off their customers.  Of course, this is a one-time deal, nobody will want to do business with them in the future if it turns out this is what they are doing.

Lawsky is just a front man for the huge sector of New York's economy based on the financial industry.  Not only does that industry directly pay half the salaries in Manhattan, but those people spend their money, which multiplies the impact.
Bitcoin, and future apps based on the block chain technology, gets rid of financial middle-men, therefore is a threat to the local economy.  These regulations are designed to strangle the baby in the crib, before it can grow up and take their jobs away.  The method is to pile on so many complications and costs, that you can't run a bitcoin business without the same overhead as a traditional financial competitor.
I think the way to deal with it is multi-pronged.  First, don't do business with New York, or bitcoin operations set up there, so long as such onerous regulations are in place.  Second, attack their moral and legal underpinnings.  It is protectionism for the legacy financial industry.  It is legally questionable for many reasons, including freedom of speech and unreasonable searches.

That's difficult to do when you are standing at the door trying to pay for a pizza with your smartphone.  I don't own a smartphone, so I am speculating here that a phone app talks to a bitcoin node through your carrier's wireless network or your home wifi.  It would be hard to run two apps at once on the phone and have them connect via different paths to different nodes.  This could be solved by having the pizza paid for when ordering.  By the time it is physically delivered you would have some block confirmations already.
The hypothetical situation you are bringing up is where you have a modified phone or app, and you are making an immediate purchase at a store counter, where they don't have time to wait for confirmations.  This can be defeated in the following way:
* The store's point of sale system (lets use NCR as an example, since I think they are integrating bitcoin) has a well-connected back end.  The store itself only has a tablet or other simple device to initiate the transaction, and a single link to the back end.  The back end at NCR, however, has lots of connections to the Bitcoin network at multiple nodes. If they see competing transactions from the same address as you are spending from at the counter, they reject your transaction.  An honest user would not be doing multiple transactions at once when they are standing there.  Since NCR is well-connected, they will observe the multiple transactions in seconds. You don't get your sandwich or whatever.  
* Further, NCR may notify your app-maker or wireless provider that you attempted a double-spend.  It may be covered by the same laws as writing a bad paper check, or that may be added in the future if not.

That argument is incorrect. Conventional banks aggregate several functions that don't need to be done by one institution.  The simplest is payment processing.  They take deposits in the form of checks, direct deposit, etc, and then send the money back out at ATM's, via debit cards and new checks, etc.  The Bitcoin network can substitute for this function, using a wallet rather than a checking account.
The next function that banks do is aggregating smaller deposits from individuals, and then lending it out on larger items, like cars, houses, or business loans.  Part of the interest they earn goes back to depositors.  There is no need for this lending function to be under the same roof as payment processing, and indeed there are loan companies that are separate businesses.  Conventional banks do it because they can leverage their own assets with whatever deposits they gather, and make a profit on the spread less overhead.  If the borrower also banks there, they have special insight into the borrower's money flow.  That lets them better judge whether the borrower can pay back the loan.

The article isn't clear on this point, but *IF* itbit has a limited trust-type license, they can't accept deposits or make loans (holding funds in trust is different, legally).  In that case they would have to partner with a regular bank to do the deposit/loan functions.

Yes, it does, and in fact has in the past, when the value of bitcoin crashed and people stopped mining because it was no longer worth the electricty.  If half the miners vanished just after a difficulty adjustment, the next adjustment would take 4 weeks instead of two, and after the difficulty would halve.  So for 4 weeks blocks would take 20 minutes instead of 10, and then things would be back to normal.
Half the miners vanishing instantly isn't a very probable scenario though.

If you are trying to do stuff in space, then yes, ores already in space have more value than materials stuck at the bottom of a deep gravity well (Earth).  The differential value is exactly your current cost to launch stuff from the ground.
Solar energy is 7 times as abundant in space as the average location on Earth (no absorption, night, or weather).  So you have plenty of power to convert reasonable ores into finished products.  Some products, like radiation shielding, don't need any processing.  Precious metals needs processing 60,000 units of ore to get 1 unit of product.  So even with abundant energy that will be hard, so it is not likely for a long time.

More like hypersonic gun on a mountain sends bulk cargo in 100 kg loads at 4-5 km/s.  Rotating elevator in low orbit (7.5 km/s) has tips moving at 2.4 km/s counter to orbit at the bottom (200 km altitude).  Thus tip moves at 7.5-2.4 = 5.1 km/s relative to the Earth, or 4.64 km/s relative to the Equator (because the Earth rotates).
The projectile does a rendezvous with the tip of the rotating elevator, hangs on for half a rotation, and lets go at the top, which is moving at 7.5 + 2.4 = 9.9 km/s.  This is enough to transfer to high orbit, where a second rotating elevator catches you and sends you to a further destination.
The combined length of the two elevators is 1500 km, which is much less than the simplistic single cable version which is 70-90,000 km long.  Hypersonic guns are just one way to get stuff to the first elevator, but they are well suited to small payloads.  [Such guns]( have been around for [decades]( for research.

I was part of the OSE project a couple of years ago, but despite their name, they never treated their set of GVCS 50 machines as an actual ecology.  Biological ecologies consider the matter and energy flows between organisms, and OSE never did that kind of analysis between their machines.
For example, they have a sawmill in the set, but I could never find an analysis of how much lumber they need, and therefore how big a sawmill.  In turn you need X amount of fuel or electricity to run it.  Summing up those power needs then tells you the total amounts of fuel or electricity to run the whole collection.

You can't.  Just create a new address, there is no limit to how many you can have.  
The US government seized the computers from the accused operator of the Silik Road illicit marketplace, and the FBI transferred the bitcoin balances to their own address.  Ever since, people have spammed that address with small amounts, with a message attached, as a way to protest.  There is nothing the FBI can do to stop it.
Addresses were meant to be disposable, because using the same one at multiple merchants allows accumulating personal information on the sender.  The transaction itself contains no personal information, but if you give the merchant your name and shipping location for a product, they can now tie it to the bitcoin address.  A new address for each transaction and emptying the balance of a previously used address (which happens automatically inside some versions of the software) prevents identity theft if a hacker gets the merchant's database.
You can keep using an address if you want to, but it's not like a checking account number or credit card number that has high overhead to change.

I'm quite aware of difficulty increases, I used to mine bitcoins until last summer, when it got too high.
I'm just pointing out that making new chips is hard, even for the best in the business. Anyone contemplating buying ASIC machines that need new chips should be aware of that fact, and factor in the chance the hardware will be late into their buying decision.
For that matter, designing and building *anything* new and leading edge is hard, and can fall behind schedule.  I used to work for Boeing, and their new 787 airplane was over 3 years late.  However, airlines don't pay for the whole airplane up front. They put down a small deposit (~10%) to hold their place in the production line, and make progress payments as each plane goes through assembly. They are also smart enough to write in penalty clauses if the delivery is late.
Perhaps ASIC hardware buyers should take a cue from Boeing, and only put down *deposits* when new hardware is promised, and have the final price depend on shipping date (the later it is, the less you pay).  When they email you a photo of your hardware ready to ship, with serial number visible, you send 80% of the balance, and 20% to bitcoin escrow to be released on delivery.
That also removes the temptation on the builder's part for "extensive burn in testing" (i.e. mining for themselves), because the longer they hold the hardware, the less they get paid.

They didn't bother breaking up the airplane builders into separate companies, which is how Boeing ended up with their main location in Seattle (where it was founded), and the unlikely location of Wichita, KS as their secondary manufacturing plant.
Since then, Boeing has opened new plants, merged with McDonell-Douglas, bought the satellite buisness from Hughes, and lots of other changes.

7zip compression of the first 128 MB of the block chain yields 33% space savings.  That doesn't help much if the user base grows 1000-fold.  What's needed is to change the exponent on chain size.  
For example, if member-owned cooperatives (like credit unions or farm co-ops) run their own block chain for local transactions, that can still be secure as long as sufficient people are doing local mining.  Instead of mining for new coins, they would work purely for transaction fees, in the interest of securing their own balances.
The cooperative then gathers up local transactions and sends them in bulk to other similar organizations on the main bitcoin chain.  They send a cryptographically signed list of recipients, so the other end can distribute the bulk transaction properly.
Something like that can cut the main chain by 100 or 1000 times.

The same property rules already apply to everything else, but most people ignore it for small amounts, and the IRS doesn't bother chasing people for small amounts because it is not worth their time.
So, for example, if you run a yard sale, in theory you can take capital losses on the difference between original purchase price and what you sell it for.  In practice, most people don't bother keeping records.  If you buy a used bicycle on Craigslist, fix it up, and resell it a couple of years later, theoretically you owe capital gains if you sell it for more than you put into it.  Again, nobody bothers.
However, if you have a stall at a local flea market and regularly sell stuff you gather from yard sales and self-storage auctions, you should probably keep track and report your gains, because that is rising to the level of a business and the IRS does sometimes go after people at that level of activity.

I know in forum discussions people throw out all kinds of random information, and a lot of it is BS.  But in this case you found someone who looks things up before typing.:
* See page 4 of  (Mid-Columbia power forecast i.e. Pacific Northwest)  Rates are around $30/MWh or $0.03/kWh.  
* US average electric rates are $0.13/kWh:  
Ratio is approximately 4:1.  Since a major cost of mining farms is electricity, they will tend to look for places it is cheap.  It's cheap in the Pacific Northwest because they have a lot of hydroelectric on the Columbia River.

You know why?  They are also the primary market makers for government debt.  Someone has to buy the Treasury bonds when the government needs to borrow, and the big banks "make the market" by buying up the bonds as needed.  They keep some for themselves, some for their brokerage customers and mutual funds, and then they sell the rest on the open market.
If the big banks stopped buying, the US government would have a much harder time borrowing, because they are not set up to deal with hundreds of thousands of lenders.  They are used to dealing with just a few dozen big banks.

This is not only an excellent description, I used a system just like it in the past.  Back when my children were small, we were part of a "baby sitting co-op".  All the members were parents with children, and we sat for each other in units of 1 child-hour.  To prevent abuse, the most you were allowed is +/- 10 hours as a balance, but otherwise we could freely trade favors of watching each other's kids.
If you extended this to bartering any kind of goods or services for future favors, suddenly you have a currency.  In a small group, people would know who owes too many favors and not let them accumulate more "favor debt".  In a large group, you need more formal methods to track favor balances.
Bitcoin got started by people mining coins and maintaining the block chain, as a favor to the world.  Once the software and network became useful enough, they could trade on that past work.

BITCOIN IS NOT A CURRENCY - yet.
Currency is defined as "a system of money in general use in a particular country.", which bitcoin is not, anywhere in the world.  Something like 0.1% of people accept it.
I live in the US, and most shops will not accept random foreign currency nor most employees accept them as wages, and bitcoin right now is in the same category *everywhere in the world*.  Perhaps in 10 years it will be as well accepted as checking accounts and debit cards, but until it actually reaches general use, it's just not a currency.

When a bank fails, they generally still have assets, just not enough assets.  I'll quote from the [most recent bank failure]( on Oct 24, 2014:


Note that total assets were larger than deposits, but the market value of the assets may have put them below zero.  The branches and deposits were taken over by another bank, which is the usual way the FDIC handles a failure.  The new bank took over only some of the assets, presumably the good loans.  The FDIC took over the rest.  Given the estimated cost to the FDIC, it implies the remaining assets are only worth 2/3 of their book value.  The FDIC loss represents 11.5% of the bank's original book assets.  
The $25 billion FDIC insurance fund thus in theory can cover about $225 billion of failing bank assets.

There is a distinction between "commodity money", and "fiat money".  People have always traded value with each other, but eventually things like livestock and measures of grain became accepted as "standard trade items" for other goods.  You could usually find someone to accept food in trade, because of it's usefulness.  Other commodities, in particular gold and silver, later gained general acceptance because they had better features for trade.  These included portability, durability, and uniformity.
I agree that "intrinsic value" is a flawed term.  It implies a fixed value outside what people assign to it.  Commodity money has value as a commodity, separate from it's use as money.  That value can fluctuate, but it's always there.  Fiat money only has value as money.  Hyperinflate it, or replace it with a new currency by decree, and it loses all value.  I will ignore the minimal value as note-taking paper or kindling.
Gold and silver notes, back when they were convertible, gain their value from things outside themselves.  Those being the metals you could exchange them for, and the legal system that supported their exchange.  It was removal of legal support that debased US notes from 1933-1971, not any change in the metals.
I think bitcoins as units are similar in the sense of gaining value from things outside themselves.  These are the Bitcoin Network (software, hardware, exchanges, etc.) that enable trading them as balances on the Block Chain, and the other goods and services that people are willing to trade them for.  Without the network and willingness to trade, they are just numbers in a large ledger.  They are also voluntary rather than imposed by decree.

I think you misunderstand how the Fed operates.  They hold the assets I noted above, which is mostly types of debt.  Currency in circulation and member bank balances are liabilities to the Fed.  A member bank (i.e JPMorgan Chase) can draw on their balance and take currency to use with their customers.  That's just like an individual drawing on their checking balance and taking cash.  It doesn't change how much money they have, just the form it is in.
JPMorgan drawing currency out doesn't change the Fed's asset side.  It only changes how much on the liability side is currency vs. member bank balances.

Plastic isn't the issue.  It's that one machine can't make all the materials and parts of which it is itself made and the materials it consumes.  Where does the graphene printer get the carbon it consumes?  How about the piezoelectric positioners for atomic scale accuracy?  Those are usually quartz or other crystals.
Even plain old machine tools like lathes don't make the raw steel they are made of or consume.  That's why you need a network of different machines, or a large workshop with them gathered in one place.  One machine can't do everything, but a collection of machines can.

Let's say bitcoin has reached saturation, and is deflating at 2%/year.  Why would you not invest and earn 8% somewhere else? (stocks, real estate, etc.).  When smart people make investment decisions today, they factor in the inflation rate to determine the "real rate" of return.  Thus a Treasury Bond earning 3% nominal when inflation is 2% (both about the actual values today), earns only a 1% real return.
In a future world where bitcoin is your main currency, and investments are bought and sold in bitcoin, the inflation rate might be -2% (i.e. deflation).  So an investment bond yielding a nominal 2% return in bitcoins would produce a real return of 5%.  That's better than just holding, so people have an incentive to invest.
We are not yet in that future world.  Bitcoins in circulation are growing at 11% per year presently, vs a 2% US inflation rate.  Adoption is growing even faster, so even though the supply is increasing, the price is going up faster.  So the logical course today, if you expect this to continue, is to hold bitcoin until it reaches saturation.  However bitcoin's total value is a tiny fraction of all the world's assets, so decisions to hold or spend don't produce measurable changes in the economy.


If I have anything to do with it, I will use bitcoin to increase unemployment (or as I prefer to call it, retirement).  That's by using it as the payment mechanism for distributed automation.  You don't need a job if machines supply your basic needs (food, shelter, utilities).  You own some that make stuff, and trade for the rest of what you want.  
The mistake in your thinking is that substituting bitcoin for fiat currencies is the only change that will happen in coming decades.  It isn't.  The future is happening in parallel, and it's all going to change at once.  Automation is going to massively change the old paradigm of working a job to make a living.  If you don't account for the parallel arrival of the future, you will get a wrong answer about what will happen.

The [Seed Factory Project]( is powered by bitcoin.  All our outside funding so far has come in that way. We are developing self-expanding distributed automation where payments between nodes can be via escrowed bitcoin.  More details on the concepts can be found in our [Wikibook](
Because there is a large hardware component to the project, we need physical space to work and funding for tools and materials.  So it will take us longer to get up to speed compared to a pure software project.  But we think the idea of automated machines that make more machines to expand capacity is important.  It has the potential to end material scarcity by exponential growth.

It's 2.3 miles from my house to the power company office, and my car gets 24 mpg city, so I would use 0.19 gal for a round trip.  That costs me $0.59 at current gas prices, and a stamp is $0.49, so it would be more expensive to make a trip just to pay one bill.  But in reality I combine trips, and typically pay two bills and go food shopping at the same time.  Since I have to go food shopping anyway, the difference for making the extra stops is minor.
Time is not an issue for me, I'm retired and it only adds a few minutes to my shopping trip.  Everyone's situation is different, and your mileage may vary, literally.  Back when I lived 18 miles from town in a rural area, yeah, I mailed my bills.  By the time I settle into my next house, I may automate my bill pay.  I would do more of that now if it were not for Bank of America deducting their automated payment *twice* a few months ago.  A push system like bitcoin is safer than a pull system like bank ACH.

There will always be laggards on the adoption curve, it's defined mathematically as 2-sigma on a normal distribution (the last 2.5% to adopt).  There will always be someone late to the party, no matter what you do.  So just accept that Maher is a laggard for now.
Since he hosts a popular TV show, the question is what, if anything, we should do about his laggardyness (yes, I made up that word).
People sometimes change their opinion based on what they learn, other times by hearing about it from friends, and sometimes they don't change their opinion because they are stubborn, it doesn't fit with their politics, or they already staked a position and don't want to admit they were wrong.
I don't watch broadcast TV, so I don't know Maher's record on changing his opinion, perhaps someone else can provide the data.  If he has a history of never changing his public position, then it's a waste of time trying to change it.
In that case showing him up as being wrong in the past, and wrong about bitcoin is useful to educate the public, even if changing him won't work.

Barclay's made a stupid economic analysis.  It's like estimating the cost of an open-pit copper mine at the rate the exploration geologist charges for assay samples.  OSIRIS-REX is a prospecting mission, not a bulk mining operation.
They also mis-understand the point of early asteroid mining.  The early market is materials for use in space.  For example, propellants for communications satellites and future missions to the Moon or Mars.  Rocket fuel is pretty cheap.  Getting it to a high orbit currently costs ~$5000/kg.  Some Near-Earth asteroids are ~20% easily extracted fuel - water and carbon, from which you produce Oxygen and Hydrocarbons.  A mining tug can haul about 350 times it's own starting mass in asteroid rock back to high orbit over a typical operating life.  That converts to 70 times its starting mass in fuel.  It uses 5 time its starting mass in fuel to do the hauling, leaving a net surplus of 65 times.
So on a mass basis, the mining tug gets fuel to high orbit way cheaper than launching it from Earth.  The economic questions are (1) whether the cost of building and running the tug and the fuel extraction plant can be low enough, and (2) if there is a big enough market for products like fuel.
In mining there is this idea called "ore value", which is the price of the product you sell times the concentration in the ore.  So fuel at 20% x $5000/kg value = $1000/kg ore value.  Precious metals at perhaps 0.1% concentration in a good asteroid x $30,000/kg street value = $30/kg ore value.  So fuel is the more important market.  Sure, get some precious metals out later as a bonus, but start with fuel, and other bulk commodities you can get in large quantity.

If you wonder why the FED is so soft on Goldman Sachs, they are one of the [primary dealers]( for Treasury securities.  From these dealers, the securities then get distributed to the rest of the financial world.
When the US government issues Treasury securities, it is *borrowing money* from the public.  The primary dealers are the bank syndicate who are the original lenders to the government.  That puts them in the same relationship as any lender is to the borrower.  All they have to do is say "sorry, we can't lend to you today", and it would seriously fuck up US government spending, which runs on a lot of debt.
They don't hold most of the debt themselves, they resell it on the financial markets to everyone else in the world.  But they represent a single point of failure choke point in the market.  And of course they like it that way.  It gives them a "get out of jail free" card when they do something wrong.

The bitcoin price increased about 60-fold in 2013, and ASICs are about 100 times as efficient as GPUs.  That roughly matches the growth in hash rate since the start of 2013.  Although the price peaked in late 2013, it takes time to raise mone, produce ASICs in mass quantities and build data centers to house them.  So the hash rate peak lagged the price peak by about a year.  Absent a dramatic change in price, we should expect a relatively stable hash rate for 2015.  Note the "relatively".  A factor of 5 change is small relative to the factors of 100 per year we have been seeing.

Currently the block size is hard-coded to have a maximum size of 1 MB.  That was set to not overwhelm network nodes, and to limit transaction spam - higher fee transactions get mined, zero fee spam gets filtered.
A single simple transaction takes ~ 250 bytes, therefore you can fit ~4000 per block.  Since a block is mined on average every 600 seconds (10 minutes), you are limited to ~ 4000/600 = 6 2/3 transactions per second (TPS).
Some transactions are not simple ones, and either have more inputs and outputs, or have scripts.  Many transactions happen "off chain".  So the limit is approximate.  A lot of thought has gone into what to do when the transaction rate gets close to the limit.

Depending on the software, back up the main wallet.dat more often than every 100 transactions.  bitcoin-qt pre-generates 100 addresses, which are used for new send addresses *and* for change from transactions.  If you make too many transactions, the backup copy won't know about newest addresses, and therefore can't use them.
Deterministic wallets work differently, they always generate the same series of addresses from a known starting point (like a 12 random word seed), so as long as you have the seed, you can recover the addresses.
Even for deterministic wallets, it's a good idea to do periodic backups anyway.

We already have our tip bot here, which is convertible to bitcoins, and we could in the future have a micropayment system for car parking, media purchases, etc. where the amounts are too small to warrant a full block chain transaction.  Periodically you make a larger transaction to top up your balance, or in the other direction if you are getting small payments, cash out a lump sum.

Of course it's ridiculous.  The point is to protect the financial industry in New York (which is huge) from competition.  The method is to make it too expensive and complicated to start up your business.
The real question is whether the other financial businesses in New York have to follow the same rules.  I use an online broker who's office is in Manhattan.  I don't remember having to provide photo ID to open my account.  It was just fill out and sign an account application with the usual stuff, attach a voided check so they can do ACH transfers, and that's it.
If you have to do *more* to use bitcoin, that's unfair competition.

The "market price" of bitcoin is generally the latest reported trades on exchanges.  Exchanges don't handle all trades.  For example localbitcoins users often trade at different prices than the exchanges.  The trades on exchanges are the result of current orders to buy and sell, and the price thus will vary according to current supply and demand to buy and sell.
Current supply and demand is not the same as long term holdings of bitcoin for the future (a demand side condition) and the constant generation of new coins by mining (a supply side condition).  The current supply and demand can fluctuate minute by minute as individuals decide to buy and sell for whatever reasons they have.  Long term demand for holding, or supply from mining changes more slowly.


The usefulness of the Bitcoin Network in moving and storing money is what gives it value, just like the usefulness of the UPS Network in moving packages is what gives it value.  The Bitcoin Network consists of software, network nodes, custom mining hardware, the block chain database and other components.  These component can be improved or increased in number, making the Network more useful.  
The more useful the Network is, the more people will want to use it.  The only way to use the Network is to have a non-zero address output on the block chain (i.e. some bitcoins the currency unit as distinct from the Network).  So demand to use the Network drives demand for the currency units.  The supply of units is finite and grows according to a fixed algorithm.  If demand grows faster than supply, the price of a unit must go up.
I can't predict short term changes in price, they are caused by individual decisions to buy and sell, and amount to random noise in a statistical sense.  I look at longer term trends like the numbers of merchants and user wallets.  They are an indicator of demand to use the Network.  So if they are going up, eventually the price will follow, but I can't tell you exactly when.

You can create a series of new block chains using identical software to the original bitcoin network.  Let's call them bitcoin2 .... bitcoin N.  Each set of users can trade amongst themselves on these new chains, Distributed exchanges can handle cross-chain transactions by gathering up small transactions and posting them as single larger ones to each other on the original bitcoin1 chain.  That offloads the block chain growth onto the side chains 2...N.

The synthetic diamond business for industrial use is 30 times larger by weight than the jewelry business.  Besides abrasives, they are used in hardness testing, as windows, and for their high thermal conductivity.  Diamond-impregnated wire saws are a critical part of making electronics - they slice wafers from silicon ingots, then dice the wafers into individual chips.

That is a contradiction in terms, like "jumbo shrimp" or "military intelligence".
The "United States" is made up of states who between them claim all the inland territory.  If you had a sovereign territory within that land mass, then the United States as we know it would no longer exist.  So your hypothetical situation doesn't make sense.
What you should be asking yourself, is if you had a sovereign territory surrounded by states that are part the US, who will defend you against invasion from the US?  The answer is nobody. The question was settled in the American Civil War, war with Mexico, and aggression against native tribes.  If they want the land, they will take it by force.
Thus to exist at all, an internal separate territory requires a very different "United States" than the one that exists now.  You have to give me a plausible structure for such a nation that would allow your "anarchist territory" to survive at all.

Well, one way to keep failures down is redundancy.  As applied to bitcoin, that would mean using two or more independent tests of the integrity of the block chain data you are using.  If your business is built on top of the block chain, checking it different ways will immediately alert you to a problem if they generate different results
Of course, anyone who knows the history of accounting knows about double-entry bookkeeping - marking a transaction on both the credit and debit side of the ledger.  If the ledger totals are not equal, you immediately know there is a problem to be fixed.  Perhaps along with code developers, we should involve a few accountants who understand about bookkeeping and auditing?

Asteroids (and bigger objects like moons and planets) are indeed different compositions.  This comes from several causes, one of which I mentioned (melting and separating by density).  Another is temperature of formation.  Objects that formed inside of the "frost line" (the distance from the Sun that water is stable in a vacuum) simply don't have water because it never condensed out of the Solar Nebula.  There are other frost lines for CO2, ammonia, methane, nitrogen.  So as you get farther from the Sun, the composition changes.
On big objects like the Earth and Mars, you get plate tectonics, and water cycles, which can further concentrate or modify ores and minerals.  The asteroid belt objects are too small for that to happen.
Specifically, yes you can get more or less pure native iron alloy, that naturally forms by density separation.  You won't get macroscopic diamonds, because that requires high pressures that occur deep in the Earth, but not in asteroids (not big enough, not enough gravity to create pressure).  You can get shock "nanodiamonds" from collisions and impacts of any carbon-bearing asteroid (there are lots of those).  You get the required high pressure, but only for a second, so the diamonds don't have time to grow.
The main asteroid classes are metallic (iron with impurities), stony (oxidized minerals, like rocks on Earth), and chondrite (small grains bound with a tarry carbon matrix), not unlike road asphalt.  Chondrites often have a good amount of water, and represent raw material that was never heated much.  Heat would decompose the carbon compounds into lighter molecules that escape, and the water would also unbind from the hydrates.  Carbon and water are very interesting to we humans, since living things are mostly made of them.
Over time, the gravity of the planets has mixed up the orbits of the asteroids, so they are no longer cleanly divided into types by location, but there is a general trend of composition as you get farther from the Sun.

Just because you put a lot of time into making an item, does not mean it has value. Ask any failed novelist.  What gives the difficult-to-produce bitcoin tokens value is their ability to be moved across the network.  Otherwise they are like data entries in a spreadsheet, of no value in and of themselves.  The block chain database is where we record transactions, but without the network, we can't add new ones.
Note that when I say the "bitcoin network" I mean the block chain, nodes running bitcoinQt or other full PC clients, miners and their hardware, web wallets, smartphone apps, payment processors like Coinbase and BitPay, exchanges, even localbitcoins users.  All of those together is what enable moving money from place to place, making bitcoin useful to people.  
Without all that, the block chain would be a static file, with no ability to transfer balances, and the bitcoin amounts recorded there would be useless.

That's very similar to one of our intended designs.  A robot tractor doing field work, or a robotic greenhouse, still needs someone who understands what to plant and how to keep everything going.  Not everyone wants to be a farmer, but it makes sense to buy shares in an automated farm, and get shares of the produce delivered directly.
The farm operator doesn't have to worry about commodity prices, they have a steady market for what they grow.  The shareholders don't have to worry about food, even if they are out of work.
The property we are buying is 2.67 acres, which gives us enough room to build workshops and test outdoor stuff.  However, to go into real production will require bigger places than that, or a network of diverse places with separate ownership.

The Bitcoin Foundation is doing other stuff besides funding code development, so I have an alternate suggestion: a code bounty fund.
Find someone trustworthy to accept donations (perhaps BitPay or Coinbase) towards code improvements.  The core developers can set bounties for particular code improvements (implementing a feature, fixing a bug), and distribute them to code contributors, thus giving them incentive to work on the code.  If multiple people contribute to a particular fix, they can split up the bounty.
If the bounty fund grows large enough, then it might pay for part or full time developers, but in the mean time it can encourage independent code contributions.

Humans have been economically outdated since oxen could turn the soil more efficiently than a man with a hoe.  Not for everything, but for increasing numbers of tasks.  Automation and robotics is just a continuation of a trend that's as long as civilization.
The mistake a lot of people make is thinking automation will be too expensive for the average person.  That's silly.  If you own a washing machine or a microwave, you already own automation.

I find it humorous that HSBC staffer Stephen King puts out a "grim report".
On topic, though, I've been thinking about what happens when the rich skim off an ever-larger share of earnings, and the workers get less (which has been happening the last 30 years).  The working classes have less to spend, showing up as lower GDP.  Also, more of the economy is based on the internet and computers.

Money is a tool that lets you trade without barter.  Barter requires two simultaneous wants: I want what you have, you want what I have.  Using a generally accepted intermediary (money), I only have to find someone offering what I want.  They don't have to want what I have, only accept money.  Later they use that money to get what they want.
The usefulness of that tool, by simplifying trade, is not affected by the political or economic system you are operating in.  For a government that issues the money, it allows them to acquire goods and services for cheap, either by printing more of it, or taxing transactions.  It also is a means of control, by enforcing rules around transactions.

Same or similar robot to install the blocks at the building site, according to computer drawings.  Drawings and payment sent electronically.
Cement is the most expensive part of concrete products, the rest is crushed rock and sand.  Making your own in a solar furnace is cheaper, and more environmentally sound.  Cement making is responsible for 6% of world CO2 emissions because it's very energy intensive and currently is done by burning fossil fuels.  Combined with automated machines to cut down the human labor, foundations made this way will be much cheaper than standard methods.
In general "make it yourself with automated machinery" can make things cheaper, especially when a network of producers make them for each other.  The furnace, block machine, and robots are *also* fabricated by automation, making them cheaper too.
This won't all happen in a day, such a producer network will grow piece by piece.  It can start with existing business just paying each other electronically (ie use bitcoin).

Grain storage was one of the features of the first cities.  A talent of grain was 25-30 kg, depending on country and era.  It was the amount reasonably carried by one or two people. A clay token might represent that you had 1 talent stored in the granary.  So grain was the valued item, and the clay token was the accounting device to keep track.
When coinage of metals was invented, the valued item and accounting device were combined into a single object.  Before that gold jewelry and copper-based tools (pure copper, bronze) were valued for themselves, and the bulk form of the metals thus also had value.  Coins were both convenient trading tokens, and of value themselves, so they didn't need to reference a storage warehouse of valued commodity.

ASHEVILLE – For 18 years Robert Mulligan has taught his students at Western Carolina University about the ins and outs of economics — from how its conditions can influence social issues to understanding money, financial markets and economic policy.
But the longtime economics professor has had to teach himself about Bitcoin — a topic so new that college textbooks aren't even mentioning the digital currency by name.
"The economic landscape could change much more rapidly than many people realize," Mulligan said. "Once more people start accepting Bitcoin, then it's a medium of exchange. Every inch the snowball rolls downhill, the more momentum and more mass it will take on."
That snowball for Bitcoin acceptance by businesses and consumers has been slow to gain traction in Western North Carolina despite its worldwide influence.
According to Bitcoin's website, the value of all Bitcoins in circulation exceeded $1.5 billion U.S. dollars at the end of August 2013, with millions of dollars worth of Bitcoins being exchanged daily.
Just three businesses in Asheville — a coffee cart, a law firm and a national chain of jewelry stores — accept Bitcoin as a method of payment, though all see potential for greater use in coming years.
"I look at my parents and how they just got debit cards, like, four years ago. For years, they refused," said Ryan Prentiss, who owns The Coffee Pedlar, a Bitcoin-accepting business in Asheville. "But Bitcoin, well, it is still just so foreign to people."
An uncommon currency
Most afternoons on the corner of Pritchard Park, Prentiss can be seen manning his artisan coffee shop on wheels, which is a custom-built coffee bar that has been mounted to his trike.
"I think coffee is a great social lubricant," he said. "For me, this business is half about coffee and half about my interactions with people and developing those relationships."
Within minutes, a woman is ordering a Japanese iced coffee.
After the two talk briefly about the difference between Ethiopian and Rwandan coffee, she pays him in cash, takes her iced coffee and leaves.
Prentiss starts to chuckle as he looks at the "Bitcoin Accepted Here" sticker, which has been plastered to the front of his mobile coffee cart for almost a year.
"It's almost laughable because I am a push-cart vendor that accepts Bitcoin, and I've only ever gotten two customers that have ever paid me in Bitcoin," the 30-year-old entrepreneur said as he put the money he just earned in a leather pouch. "It's just more of a conversation piece at this point than an actual practical thing."
The most common question he fields from inquisitive customers is simply, "What is Bitcoin?"
Bitcoin is a form of digital money or crytpocurrency. Just like sending an email, Bitcoin is transferred directly from person-to-person.
Unlike the woman who handed Prentiss her money at the coffee stand, Bitcoins are transferred completely online rather than in the physical world.
An individual can purchase Bitcoins online through a Bitcoin exchange. Those Bitcoins will then be stored in an individual's digital wallet. Bitcoins can then be sent electronically through a computer or electronic device with the push of a button.
One Bitcoin equaled $244.27 on Monday. That would make a $3.50 iced coffee pour-over at the Coffee Pedlar worth .014 Bitcoin.
Daniel Spuller, a self-described Bitcoin enthusiast and the cofounder of the Cryptolina Bitcoin Expo event held annually in North Carolina, said Bitcoin's decentralization is its most important characteristic.
"No single institution controls the Bitcoin network. This puts some people at ease because it means that a large bank can't control their money," said Spuller, who served as the public information officer for North Carolina's Secretary of Commerce from 2013-14.
Though each Bitcoin transaction is published online in a public log known as the block chain, the names of the buyers and sellers are never disclosed beyond their Bitcoin wallet ID number.
A criticism of this feature is that it has helped Bitcoin become the preferred currency for people who are participating in nefarious activities online, like buying and selling drugs.
Despite Bitcoin's originality, Mulligan said public awareness about the cryptocurrency remains low in WNC.
"Whenever you see a magazine article on Bitcoin, what they do is they show those commemorative golden medallions that people made to promote or capitalize on the popularity of Bitcoin. But it's a virtual currency and doesn't exist like that," he said. "One thing that money should do is it should be a generally accepted medium of exchange. But for the most part, with Bitcoin you still have to go through this extra conversation. That may change as more merchants accept it, but at this point it is still not there."
'We were hoping some nerds would think it was neat'
While The Coffee Pedlar has had two customers pay in Bitcoin, it's more than Minick Law can say.
Attorney Lance Williams, who pushed for the firm to start accepting Bitcoin, sighs before he begins to talk about the digital currency.
Despite having law offices in Asheville, Charlotte, Gastonia, Hickory and Waynesville, no one has paid the firm in Bitcoin.
Williams, who has been practicing criminal and personal injury law at the firm for three years, said he thought accepting the digital currency would help the law offices to stand out and appeal to a variety of potential clients.
The firm was doing some work with a few South American clients last year. Rather than making them drive to a physical place to exchange their money for dollars, Williams thought converting their money into Bitcoin would be easier.
“You scan it, money appears in my account and you pay me. That’s the bottom line for me.”
Ryan Prentiss, The Coffee Pedlar
And there was the novelty factor. "We were hoping some nerds would think it was neat and flock to us for that particular reason," he said.
But Williams said they aren't giving up on Bitcoin just yet. That's because it does not cost anything to accept Bitcoin.
As a solo entrepreneur, Prentiss said the no-cost factor was part of what prompted him to start accepting it.

Reeds Jewelers sees Bitcoin success online
Last summer, Reeds Jewelers started accepting Bitcoin on its website and at its more than 60 brick-and-mortar locations nationwide, including its storefront inside the Asheville Mall.
The jewelry company, which began almost 70 years ago in downtown Wilmington, was also the first retailer in the country to accept Bitcoin both online and in stores.
"In today's world, you've got to be able to give those customers what they want, whether it's Amazon checkout, Google Wallet or Bitcoin," said Mitch Cahn, the director of marketing and business development for Reeds Jewelers.
Though Cahn said he was expecting to see the company's first Bitcoin transaction take place on the company's website, the first two Bitcoin payments actually happened in-store in Huntsville, Alabama, and in Baltimore.
Since then, Cahn said the split between Bitcoin transactions and other payment methods has been "pretty 50-50."
However, the retail jewelery store chain has noticed something unique about its customers that choose to pay in Bitcoins.
Though Cahn was unable to disclose a specific dollar amount or range due to company policy, he did say that the average ticket total for Bitcoin customers is almost double the average ticket for other customers.
"That tells me that people that hold Bitcoin tend to spend more than those paying with credit or cash," he said.
Despite the success Reeds Jewelers is experiencing with Bitcoin, Cahn said more education is needed in the greater marketplace about what the currency is and how it functions.
"I actually just did a roundtable discussion recently at a university. The kids were young and tech savvy and they had all these questions about it," he said. " I think the industry as a whole has got to do a better job of getting people to understand it."

by Alice Ross in Frankfurt
The Bundesbank has become the latest big central bank to warn about the risks of Bitcoin, amid rising concerns from regulatory authorities around the world as the virtual currency grows in popularity.
Carl-Ludwig Thiele, a board member of Germany’s central bank, told the newspaper Handelsblatt that Bitcoins were “highly speculative” due to their high volatility and the way they were constructed.
“There is no state guarantee for Bitcoins and investors could lose all their money. The Bundesbank is warning emphatically about these risks,” he said.
Mr Thiele added that central bankers and regulators in Europe were increasingly discussing the Bitcoin phenomenon, though their efforts had so far stopped at warning people over the “enormous” speculation risks the currency posed.
A Bundesbank official said that Mr Thiele’s views were shared by the central bank, and that they were in line with recent warnings from the European Central Bank over the risks of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin, a virtual currency that can only be traded online via specialist exchanges and has no central authority in charge of supply, has grown in popularity over the past year and has attracted a number of high-profile investors. But regulators have also sounded fears over the currency’s suitability for money laundering and other illegal activities.
China last month blocked the country’s Bitcoin exchanges from accepting new cash, posing a threat to the virtual currency in what has been its biggest market. The People’s Bank of China, the central bank, also banned banks from handling Bitcoin trades, stating: “It does not have the legal status of a currency, and it cannot and moreover should not be allowed to circulate in the market as a currency.”
Malaysia’s central bank has also warned on the risks of Bitcoin in recent days, while the French central bank cautioned in December that citizens had no guarantee the currency could be exchanged for real money, with growing numbers of retailers accepting Bitcoins as a payment method.
The European Banking Authority warned last month that consumers were not protected by any refund rights under EU law when using virtual currencies for commercial transactions.
Other central bankers have adopted a more positive tone on Bitcoin. The value of the online currency leapt in November after Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said that while virtual currencies such as Bitcoin carried risks, “there are also areas where they may hold long-term promise”.
An ECB paper on virtual currencies in 2012 concluded that they did not pose a risk to price stability, provided that money creation remained at a low level, and that they could not jeopardise financial stability.
Underlining this point, Mr Thiele told Handelsblatt that while there were an estimated daily 70,000 Bitcoin transactions worldwide, that compared with nearly 60m bank transfers and direct debit payments each day in Germany alone.
Bitcoin was on Tuesday trading at $1,075 on trading platform Mt Gox. The price of a single Bitcoin has been volatile since hitting a record high of $1,242 in November, falling below $600 just a few days later.

They are using Coinbase, so Overstock gets dollars deposited to their bank account.  Coinbase turns around and resells the bitcoins to their 771,000 consumer wallet customers and unknown number of direct buyers without a wallet (like me, I buy my BTC on Coinbase but I store them offline at home).
This process does plenty for the bitcoin economy, because it circulates the coins around through the payment network.  Also, the more places you can spend your coins, the more they are worth.
Lastly, Byrne is telling everyone he is doing this to save on bank fees.  When you run on 2% margin like Overstock does, saving 2% on bank card fees *doubles your profit*.  As other businesses pick up on this fact, adoption can only increase.

We are still in the "initial coin production" phase.  On average coin production is decreasing 16% a year (50% every 4 years).  It's just the remarkable 40-fold increase in coin price that has fueled the mining boom, along with the 100-fold improvement in efficiency from GPUs to ASICs.

I'm pretty sure you understand this, being who you are.  For the rest of the audience:
When a bank opens up, and takes deposits from people, the customer's statements show how much they are supposed to have in there.  The balance goes up when they deposit paychecks, and goes down when they use a debit card, as expected.
Then the bank makes loans with the depositor's money.  Even though the money has been loaned out, the depositor statements still show the same balance.  A typical bank might loan out 92% of depositor's funds, and hold 8% as reserves.  Instead of the depositor's money, the bank now holds 92% loan assets (loans that other people owe to the bank).  As long as the borrowers pay back the loans with interest, and the depositors don't all try to take out their money at the same time, this can continue.
What happens to the money loaned out?  Eventually someone (car dealer, furniture store, etc.) accepts the loan check, and deposits it in *their* bank.  Now the money exists in two places at once, the original depositor's balance at the first bank, and whoever ended up with the loan check's account at the second bank.  Now the second bank loans out 92% of *their* deposit, etc. and the game continues until the original deposit is turned into 12.5 times as many deposits across the banking system, balanced by 1 unit of reserves and 11.5 units of loans.
This game is possible because banks don't tell you your balance consists of 8% actual money, and 92% loans out there somewhere.  Most people think the balance on their monthly statement is all actual money.  And they can pull out actual money at a teller or ATM, as long as everyone doesn't try to do it at the same time.

Until you introduce a break in the block chain history.  Trade bitcoin for something off-chain, then trade back to bitcoin later.  Fiat cash works, but so do a lot of other possibilities.
For example, lets say you have an offshore real estate trust that owns a bunch of nice property.  Shares of the trust are traded on their own block chain.  An offshore or distributed exchange lets you trade your bitcoins for shares of the trust and back again.  These trades are not directly linked the way bitcoin transactions are within a block chain.

Around 100, which is comfortably within [Dunbar's number]( - the number of social relationships the average person can handle.  Cardinals in turn have Archbishops, Bishops, priests, and parishes.  Thus an organization with 1.2 billion members can be organized with a few levels of sub-tribes, where a given heirarch is both leader of one subtribe, and a member of a higher level one.

The space elevator design that keeps getting shown in illustrations (ground to geosynchronous orbit) is based on Konstantin Tsiolkovsky's 1895 concept.  Anyone who actually understands the design of such things will tell you it's sub-optimal.
* Rockets are only expensive and inefficient because the kinetic energy to reach Earth orbit (31 MJ/kg) is about twice the energy in the best rocket fuels (L2/O2 = 15 MJ/kg).  Therefore you have to burn lots of fuel to get a smaller amount of fuel half-way, which in turn can push an even smaller payload to orbit (about 3% of launch weight).
* A full space elevator will be expensive and inefficient for the exact same reason.  The strength of the cable is limited by the chemical bond strength of the atoms, which is of the same order as the bonds that are rearranged in burning a rocket fuel.
* Between all of one, and all of the other, there is an optimum balance of rocket + elevator.  Each of them grows exponentially more difficult if you try to use them all the way to orbit.  However a rocket that only needs to go halfway to orbit (in energy terms) and an elevator that carries cargo the rest of the way will be easier and cheaper to design than either by itself.
* The "halfway elevator" will be above essentially all of the atmosphere, so your question about lightning and weather doesn't apply.  This is and not so I will stop here.

Yes, it does, but the incentive doesn't have to be by creating new currency tokens.
The blockchain is just a very good record-keeping system.  Notaries and county courthouses have been validating records for centuries for a fee.  A blockchain substitute for legal records can operate via the same kind of fee as the incentive.  Finding block hashes then is just an overhead cost, like buying file cabinets to store paper records.
An internal incentive, like bitcoin uses, makes starting up easier by attracting miners.  But record-keeping in general is a vast part of the economy.  There is plenty of external incentives if you have a system with better features.

9) The global distributed transaction ledger known as the "block chain", where a block is a set of transactions and corresponding "hash" (checksum).  The block chain only records transaction inputs and outputs.  You can find the current balance for an address by simple addition and subtraction of all the input and output transactions to date.  This is the same method used to find a paper checkbook balance.  The difference with bitcoin is that every transaction for every address since bitcoin was created is on the block chain, and anyone who wants it can get a copy.
Every full copy of the bitcoin software checks the hash values and transaction signatures of the entire block chain on its own.  Therefore it does not need to trust anyone else to verify integrity of the data and find the balance of any address.
Network nodes also keep a "memory pool" of recently arrived transactions that are not yet in a block, so they have an up-to-the second history.  That prevents people spending the same balance twice.

Not for settlement it doesn't.  Settlement of stock trades takes 3 days.  That's why dividends have a "record date" and "ex-dividend" date.  If you buy a stock on or after the ex-dividend date, you don't get the dividend.  That goes to the "holder of record", which is whoever owned the shares before you.  The record isn't updated until the 3rd day, so it is always 3 days behind trades being made currently.
The particular market that NASDAQ is applying the blockchain to is pre-IPO start-up shares.  Those shares are not publicly traded yet, so it is even slower than the main markets.  The share owner records are maintained by an attorney or the corporate secretary, by paper or a spreadsheet.  Bitcoin transactions are considered "settled" after about 6 blocks, or an hour on average.  Changing all six block hashes, each of which is monumentally hard to find, is nearly impossible.  So the 6-block-old transactions are never going to change, and everyone running a node (6000 people) has a copy.  
1 hour beats 3 days or more by a long shot.  Also, transaction fees are pennies, which is way cheaper than a human updating a ledger manually.

I'll keep explaining this, and maybe it will sink in to the general consciousness.  Asteroids are high grade precious metals ores compared to Earth, not just gold, but platinum and other nearby metals on the Periodic table.  That's because these metals are iron-loving, and most of them sank to the Earth's core along with most of the iron.
However, "high grade" means 15 parts per million.  At a current market price of ~$40,000/kg for gold and platinum that comes to $0.60/kg in ore value.  The **iron** in a metallic asteroid (the kind you would find the precious metals in) is worth at least $1700/kg, because that's the current cost to launch *anything* into orbit.  The value is even higher in higher orbits, because the launch cost goes up in that case.  So the ore value of the iron is 3000x or more higher than the precious metals.
Mining precious metals from asteroids is a side show.  Their main value is raw materials for use in space itself: propellants, oxygen, water, building materials, radiation shielding, etc.

Actually, nodes verify individual transactions.  They test a newly arrived transaction for a number of things, most importantly that the sender had enough balance to send.  The current balance of an address is the sum of all past transactions for that address.  Those are found in blocks, plus a "memory pool" of new transactions not yet in a block.  If there is insufficient funds or any other flaw, the transaction is rejected and not forwarded to other nodes.
Miners are nodes like everyone else, so they also verify incoming transactions.  What they do in addition is try to find a hash value that meets a difficult test.  A hash is a checksum, in this case of the contents of a block of transactions.  Blocks also include the hash of the previous block as data.  If someone tries to change a past transaction, the hash of the block will no longer match the hash value recorded in the *next* block, and you can tell that something got changed.
Since each block is linked in this way to the next block, the whole is called a "block chain".  The difficult test for the hash value is adjusted so the whole network of miners finds a block every ten minutes on average.  Thus someone attempting to change a transaction must also repeat all the work to find hashes for every block since then.  Otherwise we can detect the change because the hash of a block's contents no longer matches the result in the next block.  Since the whole network is engaged in finding hash values, there isn't enough computing power left to make malicious changes, as long as the majority of hashing power is honest.
The majority of hashing power creates the longest chain of blocks, and we accept that as the valid history for the order of transactions.  As an incentive for the work of finding hashes, each miner can include a "coin generation" transaction as the first one in their block.  Unlike other transactions, generation transactions have an output of 25* new coins, without a corresponding input.  That's the only way new coins get created.  Miners also get any fees from the transactions in that block.  The output of the generation transaction is set to the miner's own address, so miners reward themselves.  But they have to have found a correct hash value in order for the rest of the network to accept the new block.  That correct hash is proof that they put work into finding it, thus we call the process a "proof of work" system.
Making any changes to digital data easy to detect is the key invention that makes bitcoin possible.  Hashing a block of data as a checksum has been around for a while.  For example, you can verify a file you downloaded arrived without errors.  But if both the file and the hash are altered, you can't detect the change.  Changing digital data is generally easy.  What linking hashes into a chain + requiring work to forge each link does is make changes hard. Now you have to put an equal amount of work in to make a change, as was put in to the chained hashes in the first place.
An unchangeable history of transactions is a necessary feature for a payment network, but this method can be applied to *any kind of data whatsoever* - proof of a contract, creation of intellectual property, sale of physical assets, verifying scientific data, anything.  It's the electronic version of signing, dating, witnessing, notarizing, and filing paper records, and can therefore displace all that recordkeeping stuff.
*The original block reward was 50 bitcoins per block.  Every 210,000 blocks the reward gets cut in half, and is currently 25/block. 210,000 x 10 minutes/block = 3.9927 years nominal halving interval.  Since each interval has 210,000 rewards, then 210,000 x (50 + 25 + 12.5 + . . .) = 210,000 x 100 = 21,000,000.  That's how the total number of coins is limited to 21 million.

Segregated Witness moves some of the block data to a secondary block, leaving more room for the core part of transactions.  That allows about double the transaction count.  Bitcoin has a testnet of network nodes that allow you to try out software changes without affecting the real network or transactions.  You can make transactions on it like the real network, but the bitcoins are "play money".  A SegWit testnet is a second testnet, designed to accomodate the different arrangement of block data.  Still play money, but you can make transactions and see how the network handles it.
With important software it is always a good idea to use a "test environment".  You don't want to discover bugs on the production version (the one real users are interacting with).  This is especially true when money is involved.

Convertibility sparked tremendous creativity and business within Second Life, because you could earn "real" money with it.  It also sparked several kinds of illegal activity, like buying L$ with stolen credit cards, then cashing them out elsewhere.  If nothing else, the history of the Second Life currency is instructive.

Well, at the risk of making Bill Gate's "640K should be enough for anybody" mistake, 17GB/block would allow about 1 transaction/day for every person on the planet.  Assuming a lot of stuff is offloaded to side-chains and bulk transactions from processors, that should handle the world's total needs.
Bulk transactions are where two entities use only 1 block chain transaction to represent many individual small transactions.  They relay the individual transaction data by a different route.  This defeats the "trustless" transaction model, but do you really need that as a user buying a can of soda from a machine?

That is only true for general news media.  When you get to specialist publications, they have to be accurate in their own field, because their audience would catch the mistakes and go elsewhere if there are too many.

ETF stands for "Exchange Traded Fund".  That means a mutual fund, a legal entity where people pool their money, whose shares can be bought or sold on an exchange.  The more common alternative is a mutual fund which can only be bought and sold from the fund operator.
ETFs can hold any kind of asset.  The one closest in concept to the Winklevoss bitcoin ETF is [SPDR Gold Shares]( which trades on the NY Stock Exchange.  It simply holds a lot of gold in an [HSBC vault in London](  The shares represent fractional ownership of the gold, and the share asset value and market price varies with the underlying price of gold.
The Winklevoss Trust will do a similar thing, except holding bitcoins instead of gold.  Each share of the fund will represent fractional ownership of the BTC in the fund, and the asset value and market price will vary with the underlying value of the coins.
The advantage for investors of an ETF is that non-ETF mutual fund shares can only be bought if your brokerage has an arrangement with the fund operator.  ETF shares can be bought if your brokerage is a member of the exchange.  Pretty much every brokerage belongs to the major exchanges, so more investors have access that way.

Bitcoin addresses are disposable by design.  When you spend out of an address, change is returned to a new address by default.  You can have as many wallets holding as many addresses each as you want.
Also, if you pay via an online wallet like Coinbase, the hotel knows the payment came from Coinbase, but not any personal wallets you have elsewhere, like on your PC at home.

The block chain doesn't need to record every transaction between users.  Let's say Alipay and Paypal accepted bitcoins.  Internal transactions within each network never hit the block chain.  Transactions *between* networks can be summed into one transaction per 10 minutes on the main bitcoin block chain, and the address details sent off-chain between Alipay and Paypal.
Localized payment networks have an incentive to do this, because one transaction fee per ten minutes is going to be less than millions of transaction fees.  Users give up full control of their balances to third parties when this method is used, but do you really need full control of your assets to buy a coffee?
We already see "transaction aggregation" happening with services like Coinbase and Changetip.  They don't go on the main block chain for transactions between users, only for going outside their system.
If we assume a single layer of evenly sized aggregators, then we would expect the block chain transaction count to grow approximately as the square root of the number of users, not linearly.

Let's put the volume in perspective:
* Domestic:
According to the [St. Louis FED]( Russian Federation M1 money supply is 7 trillion RUB.  Monthly volume of 225 million RUB on BTC-e + localbitcoins is 0.038%/year conversion rate.
* International:
According to a [Bloomberg article]( there may be as much as $1 trillion held by Russians overseas.
14,000 BTC traded per month for Rubles, times $235 average price = $3.3 million/month.  That's still insignificant compared to overseas assets and flows.  Most of it must be happening in other currencies.
* FOREX
Volume on the [CME]( appears to be ~ 300 contracts per day (it is variable) x 23 trading days/month x 2.5 million RUB/contract = 17.25 billion RUB/month.  Bitcoin trading thus is 1.3% of the volume on this exchange.  I don't know how many other exchanges trade Rubles, and what their total volume is.

Maybe not all, but let's look at an example: County records clerks.  These are the people who record deeds, mortgages, and other important ownership paperwork.  Part of their mission is the integrity of the records data, and county courthouses have burned down in the past.  A distributed block chain could be an upgrade to physical vaults and computer-scanned images from the integrity standpoint.  Courthouse clerks don't have to mine for coins to make ends meet, they collect fees to record documents.  Maintaining a block chain across multiple counties just makes the data more secure, because now one fire won't destroy the data.  Backing up their records to an offsite data vault can also accomplish that, so it would come down to a cost comparison and how much security it buys you.
Given modern computer and network costs, a statewide or nationwide property records block chain would not cost much per county to operate.  It would just be a cost of doing business, like the scanners, copiers, and other equipment they maintain.

Part of it is large mining farms, who have to sell off their coins to pay expenses, thus increasing supply on the market.  Back when people were using GPUs at home, they could keep their mined coins, and so less supply.
Another part is the rise of places to spend coins, by about a factor of 100 in the last two years.  Thus coins which were being held are now more likely to be spent.  Since most merchants have costs to be paid in local currency, they convert the coins back.  The net result is saved coins are ending up on the market, increasing supply.
Once more merchants can pay their costs (payroll, inventory, rent, etc.) in bitcoin, they won't have to convert back, and the coins can circulate as coins.  To the extent they can circulate, they will no longer appear as supply on the exchanges.

Exactly.  Just like a paper checkbook register records the input and output transaction from your checking account, the block chain records the input and output transactions from *every* bitcoin address.  Since all bitcoin transactions are to another address, it is a self-contained system. You can't "take out cash" like you can from a bank account.  A consequence is the total number of bitcoins can't decrease, since they never leave the block chain.  They can, however become unspendable if you lose the private key.
The current balance of any address is just the sum of all in and out transactions from it.  96% of all addresses ever used are now empty, and could be pruned if you wanted to save disk space.  But for a full integrity check, you want all the transactions.  It's like 30GB on my hard drive, and disk space goes for about 3 cents/GB these days, so it costs me $1 of drive space.

I host the whole block chain on about a dollar's worth of hard drive space, which is nothing compared to the $10/mo my bank would charge if I didn't meet their free checking conditions.

What I follow is the number of wallets, and number of merchants, as a measure of acceptance.  Those are growing rapidly.  So demand for coins should follow, and eventually the exchange rate.

Debt certificates is a highly accurate way to describe the US Dollar, as it is entirely or nearly entirely backed by debt.  The "nearly" is if you include Treasury gold reserves in the backing.
Paper money is supplied to banks in exchange for "suitable collateral" (defined by law), and is mostly Treasury debt.  Bank lending creates additional money and debt simultaneously.  In the simplest case, the borrower deposits the loan check, increasing bank deposits (a liability), and the bank has a matching asset in the money owed back from the borrower.
Since debt is paid back out of future productive activity, US money can be considered as borrowing from the future.

That hasn't been true for about 50 years.  The US Dollar is 96% backed by debt, and 4% backed by gold or nothing depending how you interpret things.  Banks request paper money and coins from the local Federal Reserve Bank of which they are a member.  They are required to deposit collateral of equal value with the Fed (  ), and the listed collateral types are debts of various kinds.  Banks then perform "fractional reserve banking".  When they make a loan, the borrower can deposit the loan check in another bank, which then shows they have a balance and can spend it.  But the original depositors in the lending bank also show they have a balance.  Thus the same money appears in two places.  
In turn the second bank can now make a loan based on the deposit from the borrower.  Each bank creates an asset when they make a loan (the right to collect money in the future from the borrower), and another bank gets a liability when the funds are deposited (they owe money to the depositor when asked to pay it out).  The account books of the banking system balance, but each new loan allows the creation of a new deposit, thus increasing the money supply.  That added money is backed by loans.
The US Treasury holds gold in their depositories (Ft. Knox and several others).  That gold was forcibly taken from people and then Federal Reserve Banks in 1933 and 1934.  The Fed holds gold certificates on it's books issued by the Treasury, but those certificates are not redeemable for the actual gold.  So depending how you look at it, those certificates partially back the currency, or are worthless.  At current market prices, they are equivalent to 4% of the US M2 money supply. 


There are two entities called "bitcoin" which are often confused.  One is a finite commodity that exists on the block chain, of which there are about 12.5 million units at present.  The other is a network of hardware, software, exchanges, websites, phone apps, and individual users, plus the block chain database.  The network enables moving money from one place to another quickly and cheaply.  This is a useful function, and therefore the network has value in and of itself.  It does not need backing by anything else, any more than the UPS network of trucks and shipping terminals needs backing.  The UPS system has value because it is useful to people.
The only way to use the bitcoin network is to have some units on the block chain. So demand to move money creates demand for the commodity units (colloquially called "bitcoins" or "Satoshi" for the smallest fraction).  This is similar to the demand for steel products creating a demand for iron ore, a commodity necessary to make the steel.  The quantity of bitcoins available to purchase, and the demand for them, both vary from day to day, thus the market price fluctuates like any commodity.  
The 10,000-fold increase in market price in the past few years is a direct result of demand going up faster than supply.  Demand is going up because the network is both growing and improving in usefulness (better software makes it easier to use, more places accepting bitcoin makes them easier to spend, etc.).  Supply grows relatively slowly because of the 25 new coins per block rate built into the code.
Part of the demand is not based on immediate need to move money, but on a prediction of future usefulness of the network.  People see that the network is growing (more users) and improving (new apps, updates to existing code).  People therefore buy bitcoins now for their own later use, or to resell to others in the future, because the current price is expected to be cheaper than in the future when usefulness is higher.  That prediction may or may not be correct, but it does contribute to current demand, and thus current price.

It has plenty of reason to happen.  It lets people borrow against their own future.  If you can only pay for stuff with coins acquired from past efforts, you have to wait to buy that house or car.  It lets banks in the aggregate lend more than their original investment, and thus leverage their returns.  Thus you have willing people on both sides of the transaction, and therefore it will happen.
Substituting bitcoin for the current ACH network will speed up payments, but it has no effect on the desire to have things now rather than later, or the desire to leverage your assets for gain.

Did you consider the wider uses of secure digital record-keeping via chained hashes and proof of work (i.e the block chain)?  Bitcoin was the first application, and the records being kept are financial transactions, but the method applies to any kind of data whatsoever.
I'm in the middle of buying a house, and the entire transaction is taking over a month to complete, and the fees total around $5,000.  The deed to a house at root is just a paper record of the ownership transfer, kept in a secure location (typically a vault in the courthouse).  A title search involves looking up the chain of ownership of the property.  To me these things look ripe for replacement by a searchable all-electronic system.

What you do know is how many coins haven't moved over whatever interval you decide is "long term".  Let's use a year as an example.  The number of coins that have not moved in a year is easily found from the block chain.  That sets a floor on the "lost or long term savings" sector.  Some additional amount will have moved between wallets, but still kept as savings.  There are ways to estimate that, though not get an exact figure.

Worldwide net assets are on the order of $300 trillion (I don't know exactly).  However you can create new assets and liabilities out of nothing, simply by creating a debt instrument.  The borrower has a new asset, a loan check, and at the same time a new liability, a loan balance.  The net hasn't changed, but the total on each side of the ledger is larger.  The banking system treats the loan check as a claim on future work by the borrower (plus interest), so you are in effect borrowing from the future, which doesn't exist yet.
The block chain can only record transactions measured in bitcoin.  Extraneous data may be tied to transactions as notations in the block chain, but that doesn't change how many bitcoins there are.  It would make the value of a *particular* transaction output higher, if it represents ownership of some other asset.

Gold would need to be priced at $5,000/oz to 100% cover currency in circulation.  Treasury and the Fed don't have to cover checking accounts filled with bank-loan backed fractional reserve lending.  The various loans are already backed by a house, car, or business asset, or the earning power of an unsecured borrower.  You also don't have to cover all the currency in circulation, as the Fed currently holds Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed agency securities (in turn backed by real estate).  You may argue that those assets are not worth face value, but I don't think you can argue they are worth nothing.
If the US wanted to go back on a gold standard, the question is at what price would their gold holdings be neutral (not too many redemptions or deliveries), and how much of their existing debts would they want to sell for gold, or conversely, sell their gold for other assets?  At current market, the gold would back about 25% of the currency, which probably isn't enough to instill confidence.  They would probably need to do a regular gold purchase plan, paying for it with T-bonds and Agency debt.  That would tend to raise the price of gold by creating more demand for it, and depress agency/T-bond prices.

Western Union charges $10 to send $200 from the US to the Phillippines, a common remittance destination.  That's 5% in fees.  Depending how the funds are sent, bitcoin can cost 0-2% in fees.  The ideal situation would be getting paid in bitcoin in the US, and spending it in bitcoin at the other end.  Then there are no conversion fees.  Worst case should be no more than 1% conversion at both ends.
As more businesses and individuals accept bitcoin, there are more chances to go without conversion fees, but even today you can save quite a bit.  And remittances are $500 billion worldwide, so even a fraction of that is a big market.

The fiat banking system is two layers.  Banks process transactions with their customers directly.  They settle with each other (clearing) once a day for the net amount of incoming minus outgoing funds.  So the clearing-houses don't have to process everyone in the world's transactions, just the 35,000 or so banks around the world that need to settle up with each other.
Similarly, bitcoin can use second-layer systems of various types to offload the core blockchain.  An example would be Internet of Things transactions, which are likely to be small ones.  Rather than every refrigerator making main-chain transactions, you instead would communicate with General Electric and other appliance maker's servers, and they would aggregate many small transactions into larger ones.

No, it will just cause them to *move*.  Right now cheap labor and cheap electricity are the main drivers for miners, so most of them are in China.

I don't know where that vision comes from, but it is unreasonable to expect to run a major worldwide financial network on home PC's, whether or not the network is distributed.
Distributed is a great goal, but we can achieve it by dividing the cost of nodes among some number of users.  That way each node is moderate cost to run, and can have beefier specs.  If bitcoin has 100 million users, it's reasonable to group them by 100 at a time, and pay for a million nodes.

It depends on the bank and how much.  My credit union doesn't care (I asked their staff before I started), other banks have refused transfers or closed accounts.  The reason it happens is the US government is pressuring banks to "cut off the air" (their phrase, meaning money flow) to businesses they don't like.  That includes porn, money laundering, Wikileaks, and others.
Some banks see bitcoin as money laundering potential, like cash, because it's difficult to trace and has little regulation.  So to avoid trouble with the Feds, they will stop whatever they think is suspicious.  There are no official rules on what is suspicious, so it's left to the banks to decide.


Coinbase and Circle have the best reputation in the US.  They have substantial venture capital invested, so they are not likely to run off with your money.  Still, I don't like to take chances, so I buy coins at Coinbase, and then transfer them out immediately to my own wallet.  That way if there is a problem at Coinbase (insolvency, federal raid, hacker break-in), it won't affect me.
I was one of the top currency traders in the Second Life virtual world from 2006 to 2012.  Their internal Linden Dollar was convertible to US dollars and paid out via PayPal,  and players bought them originally with credit cards and PayPal.  That left an opportunity for card fraud and money laundering, so the operators of that world had to institute automated tools to prevent it.  Basically if you moved too much game money too fast or tried to cash out too much, they froze your account.  I had that happen a few times.  
Like banks, the Second Life people don't care themselves about money laundering.  But they have to monitor it to stay out of trouble with the government.  It's a pervasive issue in the US.

Bitstamp operates out of the UK.  London is a big financial center, and presumably has law enforcement familiar with tracking financial crime.  If you can identify *any* downstream recipients, the police can go talk to that person and ask where the bitcoins came from.  Then you go to the next upstream person and repeat.
The nature of bitcoin makes such tracking hard, but not impossible.  On the plus side, BitStamp can track their stolen funds through the blockchain.  If any of those coins *ever* go to them, another big exchange, or one of the payment processors, you can start to track the funds backwards.
In fact, it is in their self interest for the big exchanges, web wallets, and payment processors to cooperate on tracing stolen funds.  If those funds ever pop up on any of their accounts, the thief can potentially be caught, and therefore is less likely to steal from them in the first place.

You can ask, but doing so would be "offering securities".  That activity is governed in the US by SEC and state securities rules.  In simple terms, a security is when you have the right to profit from the work of others, such as shares of company stock.  The definition of a security, and the government rules that apply to them, are way more complicated than that, but you should be at least aware of what king of tarpit you are stepping into.
You can choose to ignore securities rules, but if they catch you, expect large fines or jail time.  You can also try to avoid the rules, by working from a lenient location, or making your offering "not a security".  For example, instead of raising capital for a big factory machine by selling shares, you can have the investors buy the machine as partners or joint owners, then lease it from them.

Dumb economists keep ignoring the "time preference for spending".  Most people spend most of their money on food, shelter, utilities, and other necessities.  They will do so regardless of whether the currency is inflating or deflating.  Most people also have wants they desire in the near term, like going to a new movie release, or flowers for the garden.  They are not necessities, but their timing is limited.  This part of the economy will also continue to happen.
Dumb economists also ignore "real rates of return".  That is the nominal rate of return on an investment minus inflation.  It tells you how much real stuff you can buy in the future.  Deflation just means a negative inflation rate, so it adds to to nominal rate instead of subtracts.  The investment world is competitive, and investors will still demand a similar real rate for the risk they are taking.  So in a deflationary environment, the nominal rate of return will adjust downwards to get the desired result.  Thus people will still have reason to save and invest.
Thus we see that the deflationary boogyman is entirely unwarranted.  However, for central bankers, they can't appropriate as much of the economy in a deflationary world, because there is less need to issue more currency.  So they hate deflation with a passion.

What people confuse is "utility value" - what you can use a thing for that people value, with "intrinsic value" which would be a measurable property of a thing, and "market value" - what people are willing to give up in exchange for a thing.
People will agree that an ounce of gold has a certain mass, and you can measure that mass with a scale of some kind.  That is an intrinsic property - it can be measured using the object itself.  The market value of gold bounces around all the time, and looking at a piece of gold doesn't tell you what that value is.  You have to refer to an external market or past sales.

If we are talking about corporate bonds, the corporation borrows money from someone (usually a syndicate of investment banks), with a promise to pay it back with interest.  Leasing a physical asset is similar, where returning the asset at the end of the lease, plus lease payments in the interim, amount to more than simply paying cash to buy it.
If you mean government bonds, the government borrows money, usually because they don't take in enough taxes to cover spending, with a promise to pay it back with interest.  Again, a syndicate of investment banks usually does the initial lending.
Thus bonds are not created out of thin air.  They consist of a contract to borrow money at one time, and pay it back later with interest.  So bonds have ratings (AAA to CCC and so on) to indicate the probability of the borrower paying back the loan.


Federal reserve notes (common US paper money) are issued on the deposit of suitable collateral by the requesting bank.  The list of suitable collateral is in the Federal Reserve Act, but basically government bonds and highly liquid bank assets.  Small denomination notes (1 to 100 dollars) are more convenient for customers to deal with than bank collateral.  But again, they are not created out of thin air, it is a swap of collateral for the notes.  If the bank for some reason doesn't need circulating notes, they can swap them back and get their collateral again.

I agree.  They have some control over purchasing power, but not total control.
One of the Federal Reserve's two explicit jobs is to maintain the purchasing power of the dollar (the other is to support full employment).  To do their job, they have various tools, but when the economy goes all whacky (2008) those tools are thrown out the window and they print money.  That the last batch of money printing (quantitative easing) hasn't resulted in massive inflation has to do more with slack in the economic system and banks just parking surplus funds, because they don't see safe places to lend it.  We may yet see lots of inflation if the economy gets to 100% and some new bubble causes the parked funds to be put to use.  You then have more dollars chasing a finite amount of real goods, and thus inflation.
The smart thing to do would be to unwind the excess money printing while there is still time, but central bankers always seem to find a reason not to do the smart thing.  Right now it's "we haven't reached full employment yet".

You want to move a million dollars to an island tax haven, you first set up a shell company there.  The shell sells you a worthless asset for a million dollars in bitcoin.  You actually transfer the coins to yourself, as you own the shell company.  Then you sell the coins on an exchange, and deposit the funds in the local bank.  
Unlike a bank wire, a bitcoin transaction makes it hard to trace where the money actually went, which is the whole point.  Your assets in your home country are reduced, and the assets in the tax haven are increased.  There are more complicated ways to move the funds, but you can have all the appropriate paperwork on your end (contracts, notarizations, etc.) for what you purchased, in case you are audited.

There are more ways to reanimate you.  You can map the frozen brain one microscopic layer at a time with a scanning microscope, then scrape/ablate away a layer, and repeat.  Stem cell research is making good progress, so once the brain is fully mapped, you build a new body from regrown cells, and guide the brain cells to the same locations with nanotech.
Alternately, with the mapped brain, just upload it to a computer and run it as software, either in a virtual reality, or a robot body.  This is generally referred to as "uploading".

That just indicates the ratio of "savings accounts" to "checking accounts".  I put money aside for home or car repairs, and it doesn't move much, whereas my checking account turns over monthly.
Bitcoin users would similarly have funds they are setting aside for a longer term purpose vs. current spending.  We just don't have different kinds of addresses the way banks have different products.
Given the huge amount of venture money going in during 2014, I would expect a lot of people are in "savings mode".  Setting aside some bitcoins on the expectation that *something* will come out of all those ventures.  The utility of the coins, and thus their value, is expected to go up.  But that change will take a few years, not next month.

Mike is showing his ignorance of how our financial system works.  The US Dollar is backed by debt.  Federal Reserve-issued currency is backed by [Treasury bonds and mortgage securities]( (page 4).  Bank deposits are backed by bank loans.  Paper currency and deposits are equally usable for payment, and any ATM will convert one to the other.
To the extent that mortgages and bank loans are secured by assets, the money issued against them is backed by hard assets, just at second remove.  The unsecured bank loans and government bonds are backed by the earning power of the borrowers.  In the latter case, it's earning power by virtue of force, but still an earning power.
Finally, there are 260 million ounces of gold reserves still on the books of the Fed.  It's not convertible, and the Fed can't even get its hands on it -- it's stored at depositories by the Treasury.  But it still exists as an asset if they wanted to apply it as currency backing.  People always seem to forget that when we went off the gold standard, the gold didn't vanish in a puff of smoke.  It just became immobile in vaults.

Nope.  You need more and more skills to create new technology.  You don't need as much to *use* the technology.


Assume automated machinery and robots which have two primary outputs: parts for more automated machinery and robots, and end-use items like robot tractors and greenhouses for growing food.  Assume further that you don't need a PhD to *run* the machinery.  You need some skills to design new machines, but that's similar to open-source software.  Programmers write the software, but once written, anyone can use it.
The automated end-use machines produce food, building materials, utilities, etc. so you have more than a subsistence-level quality of life.  And you don't have to work hard to reach that level, just oversee your share of the machinery.  People will still specialize in farming, building, etc. and trade for the rest.
All that is necessary to reach this state is building the first set of machines and robots, which then set about self-upgrading and expanding the core production, while spitting out a stream of end-use items.  That "starter kit" is affordable if split among a group of people.
I think this a a better approach than things like Basic Income.  UBI requires taking money by force from one group in order to give it to another.  If you build and own your own production, you don't need an outside job or income stream to support yourself.  And to the extent things are automated, you won't have to work too hard running your stuff.

Those additional users can subscribe to data-center server class nodes that can handle the 100 MB blocks, and split the cost 100 ways.

I'll give a personal example:
Morgan Keegan, the former brokerage division of Regions Bank, used inflated values for the mortgage-backed securities they held in their bond funds.  This in turn inflated the value of the funds.  When the market for these securities imploded, investors lost up to 90% of their money, because the funds held a whole lot of those securities, and they were leveraged.  I was one of those investors.
Rather than go to court for fraud, Regions Bank paid out $265 million as a settlement ($200M through the SEC, and $65M through a class action), without admitting guilt.  This amounted to 20% of investor losses.  The guy who manipulated the securities values, James Kelsoe, had to pay a personal $400,000 settlement, and is disbarred from working in the securities industry.  Nobody went to jail.
The various lawyers at the SEC, state Attorney General offices, and the class action decided that a settlement would get money to the investors faster and more certainly than taking it to trial.  Regions Bank could have fought the case for a generation.  As it is, I got my final check two weeks ago, 9 years after the fraud was committed.  You can argue whether that decision was right or wrong, but that's the way it went.
The same logic seems to have played out at other banks and brokerages: pay a fine or settlement now, and be done with it, rather than fight in court forever.  As part of the "plea bargain", maybe a lower level guy like Kelsoe takes a hit, but his bosses at Morgan Keegan, and *their* bosses at Regions Bank are protected.

Yeah, it is.  14.4k modems were introduced in 1992.  14,400 bits/sec x 600 seconds/block = 8.64 million bits = 1.08 MB.  So in theory 24 year old technology could handle the current block size limit if you are only downloading new blocks.  If you have 8 peers, then ISDN speed will do.  The protocol for ISDN was defined in 1988, and Verizon, at least, no longer takes orders for it, so it is becoming obsolete.
Personally, I figure if storing the blockchain costs a couple of dollars a month, that is still much less than the $12/mo my bank charges for basic checking.  At current prices for hard drives, that is 80 GB/mo, or 18 MB/block.  If it goes much above that, the thing to do is share the cost of a node among several people.  If we actually needed 64 MB blocks, that means 64x as many bitcoin users as today, so finding some people nearby to share the cost would be easy.

n is the regular number of new blocks on the main chain, so "n * 10" minutes is needed for getting n confirmations *plus* the light travel time to Earth and back.
So zero confirmation is just 2 x light travel time (to Earth and back), and each confirmation adds another 10 minutes.  Zero conf means "the network has seen this transaction", thus unlikely to be double spent *on Earth*.  But there is plenty of time on Mars to send another transaction locally to spend the same coins, as long as you separate the transmission to Earth from the local net
You can send an encrypted off-network transaction on it's way to Earth, decrypt it at Earth and submit it to the Earth network, which the Martian Merchant would have no idea about.

No, there is a whole industry that's been around for decades that's the "New Swiss Bank Account".  The Swiss were the first, but by far no longer the only.  The general names are "Offshoring" (moving funds to another country to gain some advantage), and "Tax Havens" (where tax savings specifically are the goal).  Other purposes include privacy, stability, etc.  For example, people may move assets from Russia or Venezuela to the EU or USA because the currency is more stable and less prone to random seizure.
Big corporations, Banks, and international legal and accounting firms play the game of moving money around for themselves, or for rich customers, more or less legally.  Often it's not as simple as opening a bank account in a tax haven.  Much more complex deals are structured to increase tax savings and privacy.  As a random example, it would be hard for the IRS to prove a US citizen is the beneficial owner of an office building in London, whose business account is in a Bermuda bank in the name of a Lichtenstein shell corporation.

This wasn't a bond rating error, it was a difference between the actual market price of the security, and what he used to calculate the daily NAV.  The reason he did it was the market price was tanking, and they were heavily invested and leveraged, and it would spook the investors, leading to a run on the fund.  The fund eventually lost 90% of it's share value, so his lies were futile.  But by keeping the information from the investors, they didn't know to cash out when the losses were 10 or 20%, they lost everything.

It's not just individual countries.  Modern tax strategies involve arbitrage between countries and their different tax rules.  For example, Ireland has very low tax rates on [intellectual property]( (page 8).  So companies move such assets to Ireland, or create them, and lease their use to other parts of the company in other countries.  This effectively moves income from a high tax country to a low tax one.
Now, hiding assets is a different matter, but still can use a chain of ownership across countries to make tax collection more difficult.  If one link is broken, like where Switzerland changes its rules, you have time to reorganize the other links.

Not so much for me, because designing methods of asteroid mining is what I *do*.  To do that, you have to understand where and how the ores form.  I figure actual mining, especially precious metals, would be of interest to bitcoin people:
Metallic asteroids are the result of large planetoids forming in the early Solar System.  They melted either from collision heating, or decay of radioactive Aluminum.  Then they separated into layers by density, with iron at the core because it's the densest.  Lastly, some of the planetoids got broken up by big collisions, leaving chunks of the core exposed.  Some of the bits hit the Earth, as [metallic meteorites]( which is how we know what they are made of.
The "harvesting" you speak of consists of slicing up a suitable asteroid into manageable chunks, probably with a laser, then heating the chunks with concentrated sunlight to forging or casting temperature, or machining it directly into parts.  Nowhere in that process is there a place for separating out the precious metals.  It would be a lot of extra effort for very little return.
Nature has been nice enough to do the primary ore separation, back in the planetoid era, leaving you with refined metal that is typically 90% iron, 9% nickel, and 1% cobalt.  That's already a decent grade of alloy to make things with.  Precious metals only would matter when the cost of launch x % of space products that need to come from Earth is lowered by a factor of hundreds to low thousands.  That makes the ore value of raw asteroids in the range that scrap iron is on Earth today (cents per kg).  The precious metals value would then be a large enough fraction to be worth bothering with.  That day is a long way in the future.

Let's say the number of bitcoin users and transactions increases by a factor of 10.  That means I can find nine other people to share the cost of a data center node.  The number of nodes has not changed, so bitcoin stays just as decentralized.
With 10 times as many users, I am more likely to find people in my local area (Atlanta) to share that cost.  If Google has finished their rollout here, I don't even need to use a data center, surely uncapped symmetrical 1 Gbps service is sufficient.  I would then just buy a server-class machine myself to host the blockchain, and let other people access it on a subscription basis.
With 10 times as many users, the price of bitcoin is likely to increase ~ten-fold, because supply is fixed, but demand would increase dramatically.  So 1 BTC out of my stash should be enough to pay for the server.
Decentralization doesn't mean everyone has to be running a node out of their home.  It means the current node count (~6000) with lots of different owners should be maintained.  I don't see a problem doing that.

Download a wallet, and don't reveal the keys to anyone.  
The poorly named "bitcoin wallet" is more aptly thought of as a "keychain", because it stores the cryptographic keys that control bitcoins at a given address.  Anyone with the keys can use them to create a transaction, and move the coins to a different address.  If anyone but you has the keys, they can steal your coins by moving them somewhere not under your control.
Wallet software handles creating, storing, and using the keys, and making transactions with them.  The original bitcoin software, now called Bitcoin Core on the [Choose your wallet]( website does this, but it also runs a node on the bitcoin network.  Nodes relay transactions to each other, but also verify the transaction is a valid one in multiple ways.  To do this, they have a copy of the entire history of every bitcoin transaction (the "Blockchain"), which is around 100 GB at present.  These are called "heavy" or "full" wallets.  "Light" wallets only handle transactions and keys, but don't carry a full copy of the blockchain.  Sometimes they have a "pruned" (in the trimmed tree sense) transaction list, that only stores the ones for addresses with non-zero balances.
Hardware wallets keep the keys in a device, rather than a file on a computer or phone.  Typically it is a USB drive-like format.  Since you can remove it physically when not using it, it is hard to hack.  "Cold Wallets" and "Paper Wallets" are respectively offline, and physically written or printed keys or seeds to generate the keys.  They are also hard to hack remotely.  They don't help if you have roommates.
What type of wallet to use depends on your PC setup, internet speed, how much your bitcoins are worth, and how much you care about self-control and security of your stuff.  Coinbase is generally OK, I use them myself to buy and sell coins.  But I only keep them there when I actually need to do one or the other.  The rest of the time the coins live on my offline PC.  If, for example, the IRS decides you are a tax evader, they can demand Coinbase freeze your coins, or hand them over, and they would have to.  A number of other exchanges have failed, been hacked, or run off with their customer's coins.  I'd rather not take the risk of either of those scenarios.

The 1 MB limit was originally put in by Satoshi Nakamoto to prevent denial of service by spam transactions from filling up the blocks, to the detriment of real transactions, and to using up excessive hard drive space.  Miners can choose transactions with the highest fees to fill their blocks, and toss the spam.  That forces spammers to put at least as high a fee on their transactions as other people, making spam expensive.


Network node bandwidth, and ability to validate the block hash is limited.  Blocks that are too big take longer to relay, so miners might lose the race to post their block and win the block reward.  Transactions with too low a fee therefore cost more to process than they are worth.

[Here is the fund description]( from the Wayback Machine.  When they say "multiple asset categories", they mean corporate bonds, equipment leases, mortgage securities, etc.  The types of investments are more fully described in their [Statement of Additional Information](
At first they were reasonably distributed across different categories.  But despite item 5 on page 2 of the second link limiting investment of more than 25% in one industry, they put 65% of the fund assets in mortgage-backed securities.  Since the fund was also leveraged, when that category imploded, the fund as a whole lost 90% of it's value.  None of the class actions bothered claiming they exceeded their investment limits.  Lying to shareholders and the public about the actual value of the securities was a more serious issue, so that's the one the SEC went after them for.
Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were technically insolvent after the financial crisis, since their entire portfolio consisted of mortgage-backed securities.  Since many of the home mortgages backing the securities went bad, the securities lost money (payouts to investors were more than interest collected).  The only thing that saved those two agencies from bankruptcy was the [Federal Reserve]( buying up a lot of the bad securities, leaving them with the good ones.
The Fed carries these securities at face value, not market value, because they make the rules and they say so.  But in reality, the US dollar is backed to a substantial degree by crappy mortgages.  If the Fed had to value them at market value, they would be technically insolvent too.  Since they are the central bank, they can be patient.  The old crappy loans get foreclosed on eventually.  The economy is doing better, so some of the loans are getting paid off.  The Fed is replacing the bad securities with better grade ones as the old ones mature.  These have reasonable mortgages which actually are paying interest, so the Fed is making back their losses.  
Part of why interest rates have been kept low for so long is so that borrowers can afford their home mortgages, and the Fed and their member banks can make back some of their losses in the crisis.  So while I personally lost a lot of money from that bond fund, now I'm making some of it back with a 3.25% mortgage on my house, which is really low.

3D printing is definitely one of the "seed" technologies, but it is not the only technology.  They need to be considered as part of an integrated set.  For example, the 3D printer can produce a plastic pattern for a part.  You use the pattern to make a sand-casting mold.  Then you use a solar furnace to melt metal, and cast the part.  Finally you use a CNC machine to finish the part to a high tolerance.  
If you don't damage your pattern, you can use it to make many copies, and casting is much faster than 3D printing.  A cast part that is close to the right shape is less work to machine than starting from raw bar stock.  Also, a 3D printer that makes metal items directly is much harder to build than one that makes plastic parts.  The set of three tools (3D printer, furnace, and CNC machine) is more capable than each machine by itself.

Keeping my copy of the blockchain up to date uses less than 1% of my CPU time and bandwidth, and about ten cents worth of hard drive space, on a 2009 vintage desktop.

I originally started mining in 2011, and have never had to re-initialize my copy of the blockchain.  Based on it taking ~2 hours per month to update, I would expect if I had to restart completely it would take ~ 2 days with my current setup.  My PC is still usable when I do an update, I run it in the background while I do other things online.
If I was starting from scratch, and the blockchain was considerably larger than it is now, I would take a portable hard drive to someone who already has a copy, copy it over, then let it validate on my own machine, however long it takes.  My current desktop is getting old, so by the time such a situation would arise, I expect to have a desktop that's twice as fast as my current one.

This is an economic fallacy.  First of all, the -0.1% interest rate only applies to banks holding balances with the Bank of Japan, their central bank.  It doesn't apply to individuals.  Second, most people have short-term spending needs, like for housing, food, and utilities.  They will spend for those things regardless if they have to pay a small negative rate.  If banks want to pass on their small negative rates, they can raise fees, which is a less visible method to customers.

From the bill analysis:


There are two categories of money under US law.  "Lawful money" is legal to use, but not required to be accepted.  "Legal tender" is legal to use **and** is required to be accepted as payment for debts.  Thus lawful money is a broader category than legal tender.
What this bill does is clarify that local/private/crypto/scrip type currencies are lawful but specifically not legal tender.  So you can use them, but your bank isn't required to accept them to pay off your car loan, it's optional.

Nope, quite expected given the trend over the past 500 days.  A trend moving towards a hard limit, with variations in block size, will start to hit the limit before the average does.

It's  not just Bitcoin, but distributed technologies in general.
Consider a "MakerNet" of people who make physical things by collaboration, either manually or electronically.  Let's say you want a table.  You obtain the design files from the designer.  This is then sent to the woodworking shop, who in turn sends orders to the lumber yard and hardware supplier.  Payments are via escrowed Bitcoin transactions as each person does their part of the task.  In a fully electronic version, all this is automated once you click on "buy this table", it just shows up a few days layer.
Now extend the MakerNet to cover all kinds of goods and services, and Bitcoin balances move around between network nodes.  People who want to invest in the network can buy shares in automated equipment the same way they buy a table, or buy a whole machine and become one of the operators.  New production machines are built the same way as tables - a buyer sends an order to a manufacturer, who in turn sends orders for parts and materials as needed.
Banks are mostly cut out of this process, because they are just not needed.  Now further transfer ownership of machines as needed on a liquid market.  When I make a piece of furniture for myself in my own basement workshop, there is no income to be taxed.  If I use a Computer controlled (CNC) [router]( that should not change, neither should it change if the router is somewhere other than my basement.  As long as I own it while I am using it, it doesn't get taxed.  Buy it when you need it, sell it off again when you are done.  Construction companies actually do this all the time, but Bitcoin and smart contracts can reduce the overhead for buying and selling, so you can own the router for just the 5 hours you need it to make your table parts (or whatever)
This not only disrupts banks, but the whole income tax system.  Making things for yourself with automated machines on a small scale may not be as efficient as mass production.  But you are also not paying for stuff with after-tax income after it has been marked up a few times by middlemen, and with interest added on afterwards if you finance it.

That's highly unlikely to happen in one difficulty interval (2 weeks or 2016 blocks).  Miners are probably more aware than anyone else that the reward halving is coming in 4.5 months.  The rational thing to do is to prepare for it.  If you are currently marginally profitable, perhaps plan to shut down at the halving.  If you are currently on the latest hardware and have good profits, set some aside to weather the storm.
When the supply of new bitcoins drops at the halving, it is quite possible the price will rise significantly.  That's what happened after the last (and only) halving.  If that happens again, miners will be fine, they just have to wait a bit.  Those with a temporary operating loss can wait a month or two before dropping out, in which case the network difficulty can adjust slowly.

Back then, people were mining using graphics cards.  The serious miners had to sell some coins to pay the electric bill.  That happens typically monthly, so the reduced supply hit about a month later.  Sure enough, the price started going up a month after the halving date.

Sigh.  For people interested in bitcoin, you would think they would know more about traditional mining.  Let me try to explain:
When you look at the [Periodic Table]( you will see that "Platinum Group Metals" (PGM) such as Palladium (Pd), Iridium (Ir), Platinum (Pt), and Gold (Au) fall under Iron, Nickel and Cobalt.  That means they are chemically compatible, and mix well with them.
Large bodies in the early history of the Solar System melted for various reasons (radioactivity and impacts), and separated out by density.  The Iron-loving (siderophile) elements sank to the core because they are denser than rock.  Most of the Earth's Platinum and Gold is in the core, where we can't reach it.  However some asteroids got broken up by collisions after separating by density.  About 5% of asteroids are pieces of broken iron cores, which are called the "Metallic" asteroids for obvious reasons.
Metallics are 99+% Iron, Nickel, and Cobalt, in that order by percentage, and they contain up to 50 parts per million of PGMs.  That's an excellent ore if found on Earth, but you have to understand the concept of "ore value".  That's the concentration of the ore times the market price of the product.  The PGMs as a group are worth roughly $33,000/kg ($1,000/oz troy) on current markets.  Multiply by the concentration and we get an ore value of $1.65/kg.
However, the 99% that is Fe-Ni-Co alloy is worth 0.99 x $1654 = $1638/kg, because it costs [that much]( to put anything in orbit.  That's 1000 times as much as the precious metals, assuming you have a use for steel alloy, water, or rocket fuel in space (which we do).
So the first market for asteroid mining will be products to refuel, supply, or build in space, not returning precious metals to Earth.  You would be hard-pressed to fetch and process a ton of metallic asteroid to extract the $1,650 of PGM's in it and make a profit.  Use an asteroid tug to make 7 trips @ 1000 tons/trip, and deliver 2500 tons of net products, worth $4 billion, and now you are in the ballpark to pay for the tug and processing plant.

log(n)=x is the exponent you need in 10^x = n.  Thus log (3,162) = 3.5 and log (10,000) =4.
The log function converts an exponential change into a linear one.  That way you can plot values that change a lot in scale on a single graph and still read the data.
OK, some math humor:
d(tree)/dt = ln  (the derivative of a tree with respect to time is a natural log)

A [log scale]( is what the sawmill uses to figure out their payment to the logger.  The truck gets weighed before and after unloading, and they pay by the ton on the difference.  So in that industry a log scale is a linear one, unlike math and science.

Not as much area as the solar panels to power it.  On this picture of the [Space Station]( the vertical panels are the solar arrays, and the white zig-zag panels sticking out perpendicular are the thermal radiators.  In deep space, they would be twice as efficient, because the Station is close to the Earth and fills half the sky.  The Earth is relatively warm, which slows down the heat dissipation.
The ones near the solar array wings are to dissipate heat from the batteries.  Since the Station is in the Earth's shadow 40% of the time, they need the batteries to provide power.  Each battery is about the weight of a car, so they produce a lot of heat.  The sets of three panels near the middle are for all the heat generated in the modules, from all the equipment in them.
The modules have water cooling loops to take heat away from the equipment.  Once outside, it goes to a heat exchanger to an ammonia loop which goes to the radiators.  Ammonia has a much lower freezing point, so that's necessary on the outside part.

It raises the capacity for transaction data without increasing the actual block size, by moving some of the data to a separate file.  It's hard to get people to believe something that isn't true.
The real problem is that the 70% increase in transaction data once segwit is implemented isn't enough, since we have been [banging against full blocks]( for six months now.  Note that you hit problems long before you get to exactly 1 MB blocks.  For one thing, transactions per second vary daily and weekly.

It depends on the brokerage.
First, stock shares are already a small fraction of company ownership.  Paper share certificates are no longer passed around when people buy and sell.  Instead, they are warehoused at the Depository Trust Corporation, and each brokerage has a fractional interest in the pile of certificates.  Customers in turn have smaller interests in the brokerage's portion.
So when people buy and sell stocks through a brokerage, all that happens is accounting updates within the brokerage, and at the DTC between brokerages.  It is quite possible to have fractional shares, and in the past  I have had such, but it just depends if they want to bother with such small amounts for most stocks.  Because of trading commissions, it doesn't make sense to buy, say, 1 USD worth of stock.  Most trades end up being multiple shares.

My personal opinion (which isn't based on any technical analysis) is that 75-90% of the most recent 1000 blocks as a threshold, with a 30-60 day delay to activation.  If the threshold isn't maintained during the delay, it resets.  Passing the threshold gives miners and nodes notice they should consider upgrading before it activates.  Notice should be made within the node software, and widely announced elsewhere.
The remaining percentage who weren't paying attention during the activation period should not be discomforted much, because evidently they are not active users.  Their old transactions and balances are still valid, but they may need to update their software to spend them.  If you make it a requirement that "no user is left behind", you actually are preventing any forward progress.  There are still nodes running Satoshi 0.8 versions, and they obviously don't care about staying current.

Another way to think of it is the population of bitcoin holders hold the coins for various amounts of time, anywhere from 5 minutes to 5+years.  It's not evident that increasing the population of holders has a direct effect on holding time.  So total demand for holding bitcoin should increase with the population.  When demand increases against a relatively fixed supply (the number of BTC mined so far), the exchange rate against other things, like dollars, should go up.

If block size were zero (aside from the coinbase transaction), miner fee income would be zero.  If block size were unlimited, miner fee income would be all transactions with enough fee to be worth including.  The open question is whether restricting block size to a smaller number of transactions than those worth including results in higher total fees.
It would be instructive to plot fees as a function of historical block size, both before and after they became full.  What's unknown is how much fee income is lost by people not using bitcoin at all, because they can't get their transactions through the network.

First of all, understand that bitcoins only exist in one place, the public transaction ledger we call the "blockchain", because it is made of blocks of transactions which are mathematically chained together in sequence.  There are many thousands of copies of the blockchain, and the data is public, but ingenious methods make sure everyone's copy is the same, and nobody can go back and change old transactions without being detected.
What you, as an individual, keep safe are private (secret) numerical keys.  These keys are tied to addresses (account numbers).  Anyone with the private key can send the bitcoins at that address somewhere else.  So if you don't want your money taken, you need to keep anyone else from knowing your keys.  You also don't want to lose your keys.
"Wallet software", or just 'wallets', take care of managing the keys for you - creating new ones, tracking their balances, and making new transactions using them.  They can also be written down (they are only 32 binary bytes long) either in plain form (risky), or encrypted (better) or as a seed for a key generator that will reproduce a series of keys.
Cold storage just means the keys are not kept in an online computer.  A removable USB drive, on paper, a safe deposit box, or engraved on a steel plate buried in your back yard, etc. makes it hard for hackers, or someone who steals/logs in to your computer or smartphone.  If you have more than a casual amount of bitcoins, it's a good idea to keep most of it in cold storage.  A "hot wallet" is the opposite - kept online in a phone or computer, so that you can easily send or spend the coins.

It is instructive to look [124 years in the past]( or 1892, to get a feel for what might happen in 2140, 124 years in the future.  In 1892, hardly anyone had telephones or automobiles.  Nobody had yet flown an airplane, and barely anyone had electricity.  Genetic engineering and digital computers were unknown.
Bitcoin was released as a white paper just 8 years ago.  I don't think anyone can predict where it will be 8 years in the future, much less 124.  Centralized mining pools and farms may be as quaint as hand crank telephones that need a human switchboard operator to make a call, or horse-drawn cabs.  There is likely to be a lot of new tech that nobody has thought of yet in the next century and a quarter.
My honest opinion is then "nobody knows, and anyone who claims they do is a fraud".

As someone working at Boeing, whose payload was aboard Challenger, it's worse than that.  The solid rocket boosters were designed to operate between 45 and 95F, which comfortably covers the normal temperature range in Cocoa Beach, Florida.  The temperature range is right on the spec sheet for the rockets, because lots of other things besides O-rings are a function of temperature.  A couple of examples:
* The motor casings are made out of steel, which expands and shrinks with temperature.  The SRB's are attached to the External Tank, which does *not* change size, because it's filled with cryogenic fuels at a fixed temperature, that overwhelms any outside temperature changes.  Excessive temperature changes would put a strain on the structure that connects the SRBs to the External Tank.
* The burn rate of solid rocket fuel is a function of bulk temperature.  The hotter it is, the faster it burns.  If it's too cold, you may not get enough thrust to complete the mission.
So the problem was well beyond ignoring warnings from engineers.  It was operating the hardware out of spec, specifically 32% below the lower temperature limit (in terms of a 50 degree range).  If you operate equipment out of spec, it can break, because it wasn't designed for it.  That's the kind of thing every adult is expected to know, not just space program managers.

That's a dumb thing to say.  People want a transaction if they initiate it.  They are not initiated by random number generators.


If someone is new to bitcoin, and test it out with a small transaction, they will get dumped and never come back.  Your approach is a recipe to turn people away.


So bitcoin is only for the elite?  Those who are important and have lots of money?  On the contrary, it was described in the original white paper as an "electronic cash" system.  Cash is the lowest point of entry into the financial system, if you can't use banks or credit, cash still works.  The elite already have plenty of financial options, you don't need to reserve bitcoin for them.

The DTC is a big vault to store the certificates.  It was set up in the 1960's or so, when the volume of paper stock certificates moving from broker to broker was starting to overwhelm their back offices.  So instead of moving the certificates around, they stay in the vault, and computers track who owns how many shares.  They put all the Apple (AAPL) shares in a pile, and each broker has title to X of them.  In turn, the broker credits each of their customer accounts with however many shares they are supposed to have.  It's a two tier system.  
The shares are registered in the name of the broker.  This is called "Street name", meaning Wall Street broker.  Any trades that can be settled among customers of the same broker just require updating the broker's database.  If the net buy or sell is unbalanced, the broker goes to the exchange to trade with someone else.  
A stock certificate is just a fancy piece of paper that has a serial number, how many shares, and who owns them.  It's a duplicate of the information kept by the corporate registrar (part of the official paperwork of the company).  They need to keep track of who their owners are in order to send reports, dividends, and meeting notices.  Before computers, you sold shares by writing the new owner's name and info on the back, sending the certificate back to the registrar, and they would send out a new certificate to the new owner.  This is pretty much the same as how automobile title certificates work.

There is no such thing as intrinsic value.  Value is assigned by people according to the relative usefulness of an item.  A one meter cube of concrete at the bottom of the Marianas Trench is fairly useless.  That same cube of concrete as part of the foundation for a skyscraper is much more useful, and people will assign a higher value, despite being identical physically to the other cube.
Value varies between different people, else trade would not happen.  Each person values what the other person has more than what they have themselves.  This isn't possible if a given item has a single fixed value.
Value varies for the *same* person at different times.  You value another meal less just after you finish one and are not hungry.  People demonstrate this by not buying another meal at the same price they just paid for one.

The way the US ACH system works is payments within the same bank, or debit transactions with a well-connected business can post the same day.  If it's going to another city in another Federal Reserve district (there are 12 of them), it can go your bank ---&gt; your district clearing house ---&gt; their district clearing house ---&gt; their bank.  For legacy reasons, clearing happens once a day, so each step takes one business day.  That's why Coinbase says 4 days for basic accounts.  They wait till they are sure they have the dollars in their account, before giving you the bitcoins.  
They are *very* fast in sending out bitcoins in my experience,  I can see the outgoing transaction on the network in seconds.  I'm told they are also faster if you add a credit card number to your account.  the CC serves as backup payment in case your checking account doesn't work.  Since they are sure they will get paid one way or the other, you can get your coins right away.

I've used my credit union account with no problems, and I specifically asked if they care about buying bitcoins, to which they said no.

I still buy my bitcoins there, and keep that out of the commercial bank's business.

Well, the reason it takes 4-8 weeks, like that page says, is the broker has to request the shares be removed from the DTC (unless they happen to have a paper certificate sitting around the office), and issued to the broker, and then the broker has to forward it to the corporate registrar, who can then issue one in your own name.
Unless you want to frame it and hang it on the wall, or put it in a vault for your heirs, there isn't much reason to request a paper one, but you are right, it can be done.  Dividends will still go to the address of record that the corporate registrar has on file, so if you move, you have to let them know.

* Blocks are currently averaging ~1/3 full.
* If bitcoin transaction rate grows by 3x, they will be completely full, and a backlog of unconfirmed transactions will accumulate.
* The "memory pool" of unconfirmed transactions that a node holds can then grow unbounded, eventually exceeding memory capacity and harming the network.
* Transactions will not be confirmed in a timely way, defeating one of the advantages of bitcoin over other systems (rapid final settlement).

No, they *can* track them, because everyone has access to the block chain.  Coinbase knows what address they sent coins to.  They can follow the descendent transactions for ever afterwards.  You can obfuscate the later coin history by running it through a mixing service or an exchange.  If you deposit coins to an exchange account, and different coins come out later, that breaks the tracking.
The problem with the block chain traceability is that the coins that came from Coinbase might end up in a drug deal 5 transactions downstream.  Then they could blame you and close your account for being "drug related".  That's a lousy phrase.  Drug dealers eat, drive on roads, and usually pay utilities. On that basis, *everything* is drug related.

Bigger blocks are necessary if bitcoin is going to scale to a world currency.  PayPal for example handles about 100 transactions per second, and VISA handles 2000.  The blockchain in practice handles about 4 right now with the 1 MB limit.  Actual transaction rate averages 1.3 in recent months.  That means if bitcoin grows by a factor of 3, 1 MB blocks would be full, and transactions would not get processed in a timely way, there wouldn't be room.
Sidechains are separate blockchains which are linked somehow to the main bitcoin chain.  This offloads some of the volume from the bitcoin chain to something else.  Sidechains right now are an idea being developed, but they don't have 6.5 years of experience like the main block chain.  In the future they may prove themselves and be useful, but right now it is less risky to just increase the block size on what we have working today.

Fiat currencies theoretically adjust to demand by holding the value per unit constant, but varying the number of units in circulation.  Bitcoin adjusts to demand by holding the number of units constant, but varying their value per unit.
In reality, the value of fiat currencies tends to decrease over time, because governments run deficits and pressure the monetary agents to accommodate it. 


One way to do that is crypto-based asset tokens.  Pick whatever assets you like (gold, real estate, S&amp;P 500 fund shares), and use them to back asset tokens that can be used like bitcoins for payments.  If you choose the right mix of assets it should have a reasonably stable long-term value.  Benefits of convenient fractionalization and low overhead from the cryptocurrency methods, and you can make more by buying more assets to back it.

Elections made sense when the whole United States had half the population of the average state today, and the average state had the population of a mid-size modern city.  You had a reasonable chance of knowing the candidates personally, governing was not a full time job, and the issues were simpler at that start of the Industrial Revolution. Lastly, communication was limited by the speed of horses, so representation was the only way to get decisions made, even at the state level for the larger states.
What elections have evolved to makes no sense any more. Most of the assumptions of the 1780's are not true any more.  We pick representatives according to popularity or how much money they spend, not by how smart they are, or relevant experience with modern problems.

Something I'm strongly interested in is "industrial solar".  That's where you use solar energy directly, without first converting to electricity.  The most common use so far is for water heating, but there are a lot of other applications.  An example is replacing fossil fuels for making cement, the binder in concrete.  Concrete is the most used solid product in the world, and the cement for it generates 7% of all the CO2 emitted by human activity.

The fact that *everyone* can read and verify the transaction history is what makes bitcoin secure.  A hacker would have to change every copy in the world, and redo the block hash search, in order to change even one entry.  But a side effect of that is the history of every bitcoin and fraction thereof can be traced by address, from the 'coinbase' transaction where it is created, and every one afterwards.
Your personal info isn't attached to transactions per se, but if someone knows who you are, like when you are a Coinbase customer, they can link you to a given transaction and address, and follow from there.  You have to "break the chain" somehow to disassociate any personal info that has leaked.
Note this is still a vast improvement over paper checks and bank cards.  Those have your name printed right on them, so *every* transaction is associated with your personal info by default.  With bitcoin your personal info *isn't* associated by default, though it can leak if you tell them.

As late as last year, my electric company wouldn't take debit cards at their office, and they charged a convenience fee for phone or online payments, so I wrote a check (then I moved to another city with a more forward thinking electric co-op).
Many landlords only accept cash or checks, because bank cards charge a fee to the merchant, so they end up with less money.  For stores, the fees often are less than the overhead to handle a lot of cash and checks.  An apartment owner only has to handle one batch once a month, so not as much overhead.

That sentence doesn't make sense to me.  I have a nearly 6 year old desktop, and a 6 Mbit connection.  The block chain takes up about 6% of my C: drive, but I have terabytes of free space.  I don't think my PC setup is unusual, and it can easily keep up with running a node.  
If for some reason the requirements to run a node get beyond what someone like me can handle, the obvious solution is to spin up dedicated "subscription nodes".  Since the typical user doesn't make more than a few transactions a day, they can share the cost of hosting a node with other people.  Pay $X a month, get a log-in to use the node.
In order to keep the network distributed, an approach to this is make an open-source package of software to load on standard hosted servers, so it's not all under the control of one company.  Bitcoin-using businesses can also host such servers for their internal needs, and take subscriptions from other users.
I think the disconnect is between your idea of so many users making transactions that it overwhelms the capacity of a home PC vs. those same many users paying a small fee to chip in and host a node together. For example, if transactions come to 50 GB/month, that's $2 a month in hard drive space if I store the block chain myself.  If I pay $2 a month for someone else to host the node, it comes to the same thing.  If 100 people pay $2 a month, that's $200 a month, and you should get a pretty good server for that much.
Given that 50 GB is 20x recent blockchain growth, I would expect 20x the number of users, so finding people to chip in for a server should not be hard.

Now, it is certainly arguable that the cure is worse than the disease, but not that government minions aren't allowed to do things you and I can't.

Most stock trades these days are purely electronic.  Original stock certificates exist, but are stored at the Depository Trust Company vaults.  Brokers have "share interests" in those certificates, on behalf of their customers.  When trades happen, it just means a database at the DTC, and internally at a broker, get updated to account for the new share balances.
The main reason we are still at 3 day settlement is not *all* certificates are stored in the vaults.  Newly issued shares, legacy shares still in private hands, etc. are floating around, and being paper, take 3 days between trade and "settlement".
For Byrne to do 0 day trading, he would have to get his hands on some original certificates, or become a broker and have access to the DTC vault balances.  I should note that my online broker effectively credits buys and sells immediately.  The only time settlement time matters is paying dividends, because the company pays the "holder of record", as of the settlement date.

The same way UPS labels are valued - by their usefulness.  Without a network of trucks and terminals, UPS labels have no value, because they cannot be used to move packages.  Without the Bitcoin Network of nodes, miners, software, apps, merchants, etc. , the bitcoin token would have no value, because it could not be used to move monetary value.
Bitcoin tokens can in fact move value from place to place, with a number of features that are better than the alternatives.  Since this is useful to some people, it creates a demand for them.  Since they are a scarce good (a finite supply), their "utility value" is determined by supply and demand on the market.  The better the Network gets, the higher the demand, and thus the value against a relatively fixed supply.  Nearly 3/4 of all bitcoin tokens have been created (mined), so the supply isn't going to go up that much in the future.


"Utility value" based on the usefulness of the Bitcoin Network.  Since you need some bitcoin tokens to use the Network, a demand for tokens is created by people wanting to use the Network.


Depends on how the Network grows and improves (i.e. better software, new use cases).  Networks typically increase in usefulness the more people that use them.  But I'm not smart enough to predict the future value of Bitcoin, and neither is anyone else.  Someone could invent something better tomorrow.

That's kind of how I deal with Coinbase.  I use them purely to buy bitcoins for long term investment.  They go to a cold wallet right after they deliver the coins.  Someday I will spend those coins, but not while I am still getting more from Coinbase.
Day-to-day spending coins I will get by a different route, different wallet, etc.  The main reason I started using Coinbase in the first place is I can use ACH from my credit union.  My credit union doesn't care that I'm buying bitcoins, and it's convenient to do my monthly buy.  I'm happy as long as it works, but Coinbase is the 4th way I've used to get coins, and if it gets to be a hassle, I'll look for

Coins are not released every 10 minutes.  Coins are released when the hash value for the next block is found, and the miner includes a "coinbase" transaction in the block awarding themselves new coins (the company named Coinbase comes from this, but it originally meant a special transaction that generates new coins)
Finding a hash value is a lottery-type process, so when it happens is random.  The difficulty of finding a hash is automatically adjusted every 2016 blocks (~2 weeks) to make it *average* 10 minutes, but if mining hardware is added or removed, the rate of finding hashes can go up or down, until the next adjustment, and there is some statistical variance in how fast blocks are found.
We do know exactly when the halving will happen - at block 420,000.  But when we will reach that block number is somewhat variable.
By the way, each interval between halvings is 210,000 blocks, and the number of coins added per block is 50, 25, 12.5,....  If you sum that series you get 100, and 100 x 210,000 = 21,000,000.  That's where the limit on number of coins comes from.

My understanding (which may be wrong) is some core developers are employed by companies developing "side chains" and other services that offload transactions from the main block chain.  So they have an economic incentive to keep the main block chain small.
There are legitimate reasons to offload the main block chain, such as bloat (the blockchain gets too big to easily store and keep updated), confirmation time (about an hour if you want to be really sure a transaction is final), and avoiding the current ~6 cent transaction fee for "microtransactions".  For example, you might pay 0.1 cents to read an article online.  In that case a 6 cent transaction fee is too high.

It hasn't been linked to their gold supply since 1933, since they don't have any gold.  If you look again at table 5 of their balance sheet that linked to before, the first item is "Gold Certificates".  Those were issued to the Fed by the Treasury department, when they confiscated all the nation's gold.  
In theory, those certificates are for the gold the Treasury now has in their bullion depositories, like Fort Knox.  In practice, the certificates are not likely to be redeemed, ever (they haven't so far), and the Fed can't trade them to anyone else.  So they are probably worthless paper.  Their face value is at the official exchange rate for gold at the time ($35 per ounce), which has nothing to do with the current market rate.
Ironically, the New York Federal Reserve (there are 12 district reserve banks), has a [Gold Vault]( in Manhattan, but it's not their gold, as the web page explains.  They hold it for other people, including the Federal Government.  That way when governments and institutions buy and sell gold reserves, it doesn't need to get shipped anywhere, they just change the label on a locker, or update a computer record of who owns which bars.


The Fed is a non-profit institution.  Any surplus interest it earns is returned to the US treasury.  Since most of what they hold is treasury bonds, it is a circular flow.


The Treasury sells bonds to the public and other governments to cover deficit spending.  Banks buy Treasury bonds on the open market in the course of their business, and deposit them as collateral for paper money as needed to supply teller windows and ATMs.
The Treasury does have an account at the Fed.  When I pay the IRS, I make the check out to the US Treasury (which the IRS is part of).  The check ends up as a credit on that account.  When the US government pays someone, it comes out of that account.  That's how the US government connects with the rest of the financial system.


The Fed doesn't issue paper money on their own.  They do it when banks ask for some, in return for collateral.  Banks need cash for daily operations.  If they don't get enough from deposits, they ask the Fed for more.
@_date: 2015-07-19 18:03:44
Let me clarify.  Treasury bonds have different maturities, and bear different interest rates.  So two T-bonds with the same face value will not have the same market value.  Whereas two $20 Federal Reserve Notes will have the same market value in terms of what they can buy at any one time.  If you have two in your wallet, it doesn't matter which one you use.
Back before the Federal Reserve existed (&lt;1917), individual banks issued bank notes based on their assets and loans.  Since banks varied in distance and quality, their notes would be discounted a variable amount other than in their own town at their own office.  So paper money was not spendable at face value if it wasn't local.  When the Fed came into being, it simplified long-distance commerce, because now all currency was accepted at face value everywhere.  People today don't appreciate that aspect, we take it for granted our dollars are spendable everywhere.

A general blockchain is a series of data blocks with chained hashes to verify the contents.  Internet downloads often use a hash to verify correctness of the contents.  A single hash is enough for static data like a video file or ebook.  Chained hashes are useful when data are constantly added to, like an accounting ledger.
The Bitcoin blockchain records financial transactions between addresses derived from private keys, plus a small amount of arbitrary data if you choose.  It has a scripting language to define more complex transactions than simple A -&gt; B transfers.  These features are particular to Bitcoin.  A police body-cam may send video data to the precinct, and the precinct forwards a chain of hashes to a third party (like a courthouse clerk) in real time, to verify the video was not tampered with afterwards, such as cutting out parts.  Such an application has nothing to do with money or scripting.
More generally, a general blockchain has chained hashes, but not all the features of Bitcoin.  Whether such a blockchain is a better solution than other kinds of databases is a matter for computer scientists and software developers.  You would have to look at the particular application and what the requirements are.  A blockchain is a tool, but it may not be the best tool for the job.

Domestic wire transfers take about an hour if it's large bank -&gt; broker's bank -&gt; broker's account, if it is a stock broker.

I've done both kinds, so the speed is from personal experience.
**However** if the funds to be wired were deposited in any form besides cash, the bank may place a 10 day hold on outgoing wires, because wire transfers are not reversible.  That kind of defeats the purpose of wire transfers, which are supposed to be fast and secure.

It's more portable and divisible than a piece of real estate.

The same automation that displaces workers will make work unnecessary.  Here's how:
* ["Machine tools"]( are metal-cutting machines that make parts for other machines, including more machine tools.  They have been [automated]( for a few decades now (note the control panel).  Hobbyists can and do [build their own]( such machines.
* A group of people bootstrap a "community machine shop" starting with hobbyist-level machines, but constantly upgrading to bigger and better ones.  These are automated machines, driven by software files.  Once you have enough machine tools, you make different machines, like a [sawmill]( or (concrete block press).  With those, you can make parts for a house.  You can also machine parts for an engine and axles.  From those you can build a [tractor and attachments](  Then you can grow food.
* With food and housing taken care of, the community machine shop has grown into a mini-economy.  You keep building out your capabilities with more machines, and put more displaced people to work for themselves, making what they need.
* Where bitcoin comes into this is *not all the machines have to be in the same place*.  If they are networked, the whole network can collaborate on the next machine, and ownership of the machines can be distributed.  So when you need something made, you send out the parts files across the network, the parts get made, and eventually sent to you to assemble.  You pay for this with bitcoin, which you acquire by making other things for people in trade.
* By trading, each person can specialize in things they like to do or are good at.  The network as a whole covers all the basic needs people have.

~ 6000 nodes at the present time, and 400 bytes per average transaction.  So each transaction imposes 2.4 MB of storage and twice the amount of bandwidth (outgoing and incoming bytes).  Hard drives these days are $0.04/GB, so storage is 0.1 milli-cents, or 35 Satoshi/transaction.
My internet plan allows 250 GB/month, for $50/month (others will vary).  Thus $0.20/GB, or 1 milli-cent per transaction for the network.  On that basis, bandwidth is the much larger cost, but still pretty small compared to the average transaction fee (about 7 cents lately).

[100 million bittorrent users]( disagree (that number is seeders + leechers). Bittorrent is a peer-to-peer network, just like the bitcoin network.  Both can generate quite a bit of bandwidth.


You are still confusing mining and network nodes.  Network nodes validate and relay transactions.  Miners are also nodes, that's how they get transactions to put in a block.  But in addition they search for block hashes in order to claim the block reward &amp; transaction fees.  That's much more intensive.


Nodes validate the existing blockchain by calculating each block hash and comparing it to the hash value stored in the next block.  When a new block arrives, they validate it too.  When new transactions arrive individually, they are also validated several ways for correctness (digital signature matches, etc.).  The node also verifies the sending addresses have enough funds to make the transaction.  That's a simple lookup at past transactions for that address, and prevents double-spending.
If a new transaction fails any of the validation tests, it does not get relayed to other nodes.  If it passes, it gets relayed across the network.  Good transactions get added to a "memory pool" of new transactions not yet in a block.  Miners draw from that pool to create blocks from.  When a new block gets relayed across the network, nodes remove the transactions now in a block from their copy of the memory pool.  
Blocks don't verify transactions, that already happened when the transactions were relayed across the network.  Blocks just gather transactions and apply a checksum (hash) so that future tampering is difficult to do.


The ASIC chips that are used for mining are small.  They can be incorporated into USB devices, or electric water heaters, where the waste heat can be put to use.  Mining farms just buy a whole lot of them, and optimize for cheap electricity and labor to manage them.  But assuming you get the latest generation of ASIC, you can do meaningful mining.  Perhaps not make a profit, but at least cover electricity and help maintain the network.


Until you need one of those services they charge extra for.  And funds you leave in checking, the bank lends out and makes money on.  They aren't waiving account fees from the goodness of their hearts.

Adult listings were run off of craigslist some time ago.  So naturally the people who had adult services found a new place to put them.  Before craigslist it was the personals section of newspapers and the back pages of men's magazines.  A few years ago, adult-oriented "escort clubs" were popular in the Second Life virtual world.  One of the attractions was the internal virtual currency, the Linden Dollar.  People could buy the currency, and that showed up on their credit card, but not what they spent it on.  The escorts supplied cybersex, photos, voice chat, and live cam shows.  The only thing not allowed was arranging live sex, since that was illegal for the club owners to arrange.  I'm sure people met up in the clubs and arranged it anyway, but it was via private message.
My point here is sex will find a way.  If you want to help the process, get those distributed markets up and running.

This is common wisdom, but it is wrong.  [Federal Reserve Notes]( the official name for the paper money in the United States (it says so right at the top front), are issued by Federal Reserve Banks.  They are delivered to local member banks in return for collateral, such as treasury bonds mortgage-backed securities.
If you look at the Fed's [balance sheet]( - Table 5 and 5 (continued), you can see that the Assets side is mostly Treasury (2.461 trillion) and Mortgage Backed (1.743 trillion) securities.  On the liabilities side are Federal Reserve Notes (1.325 trillion).  Thus the paper money (which is a debt of the Fed) is backed by other debts (treasuries and MBS).  Those in turn are backed by the ability of the US government to collect taxes, and real estate.
So US money is backed by the assets of the Federal Reserve Bank, which bitcoin is not.  Why issue paper money in the first place?  It is inconvenient to pay for your coffee at Starbucks with a Treasury Bond or Mortgage Backed Security.  They are too large (generally $1000 or more), and because they earn interest, their market value at any given moment is variable.  Paper money comes in convenient small units, and are non-interest bearing, so their value is easy to figure out.

You could fractionalize ownership with a block chain type system and make them liquid.  "I'll trade you 0.1% of my car for lunch".

Instead, they buy assets locally, like buildings, with their profits.
@_date: 2016-02-24 19:55:36


That's how bitcoin started out, but if it's going to have any serious penetration and not be just hobby currency, each individual won't be able to host the entire chain.  I belong to a credit union, and get my power from an electric cooperative.  I already trust them with critical functions.  And since they are cooperatively owned by the members, they are not out to screw me for higher profits.  If my credit union decided to host a blockchain as a member service, I would be fine with it.  They already do the ACH transfers to Coinbase, which is how I buy my coins.  A model where they host the chain, and I have my wallet software on my PC, with suitable encryption between the two, would work for me, because they already know what I spend all my money on.
I'm not yet a member, but I intend to join a makerspace (community workshop that emphasizes computers and 3D printers in addition to conventional tools).  If they hosted a blockchain for members, and let you access it as needed, and wipe the session afterwards, it's not an information leak.  Again, splitting the cost just makes it more affordable, because the blockchain is never going to get smaller, even with 1 MB blocks.

Actually, your bits are not in your wallet. Only the keys that let you make transactions are in the wallet.  Bitcoins only exist as transaction amounts on the block chain.  The balance on any given address is just the sum of all past + and - transactions for it, across the whole block chain history.
Conventional banks keep all their customer account balances and transactions on a computerized ledger, which only they have direct access to.  When you used a debit card, or get a direct deposit from work, they, not you, update the data.
When you run a bitcoin node, with wallet software, you have a copy of the computerized ledger (the block chain) yourself.  You can directly make transactions to update it, and so can everyone else, in parallel.  More importantly, nobody can stop you from using your money, just because they don't like your business, or happen to live in Greece.  You control it, not someone else.

Soft forks happen all the time, when two different miners solve a block almost at the same time.  Full copies of the block chain retain both blocks.  Miners then start building on one or the other block, and one of them will end up being solved first, but likely *not* at the same time.  That chain is now the longer one, and the basic algorithm assumes "most effort chain is the correct one".  Since mining difficulty changes infrequently, most effort translates to most blocks in a chain.
So soft forks are usually resolved quickly.  If people are running different versions of the software, like one allows only 1 MB blocks, and the other allows 2 MB blocks, then one version will reject blocks that the other one allows.  That's a hard fork, because no amount of building the chain will make the software accept larger blocks.  One side or the other will be the minority, and most people will jump from the minority chain from fear of being "left behind with worthless coins" that the majority will no longer accept.
Proposed software changes like this typically include a delay to give people time to install the new version.  Once enough time or enough users have adopted the new version, the change goes live.

I'm afraid that isn't how it works.  The Treasury Department and Government Sponsored Entities issue debt in the course of funding the government or lending on mortgages.  The Fed buys this debt from banks by crediting the accounts the banks have with them.  This is called "open market operations", since the Fed buys the debt on the open market.
Banks can apply their Fed balances to their reserve requirement, which means they are allowed to make loans elsewhere.  They can also request circulating notes (paper dollars) if they have need of some for daily operations (i.e. tellers and ATMs have given out too much).
When the Fed buys debt, it aquires an asset (the debt it now holds) and a liability (the amount credited to the selling bank), so their books balance.  Unlike regular banks, though, the Fed has no minimum reserve requirement, despite "reserve" being part of their name.  So they are leveraged to an absurd degree, 500:1 or so.  It's not like some regulator is going to shut them down - they **are** the regulator.

You are asking me to be a fortune teller.  Nobody can predict the future *exactly*.  What I can do is point to [daily average block size]( and fees.  Four months ago we were at ~500k, and today we are at ~700k.  If that trend keeps up, we hit a wall in about 3-4 months.
You can't run right up to 1.00MB *average* daily block size, because some miners mine small blocks, and because transaction traffic varies during the course of a day.  If the daily peak exceeds what the miners can fit in a block, there will be a backlog.  I predict an *average* block size of 900k is where we will start seeing serious backlogs develop.  Confirmation delays as a normal occurrence damages bitcoin's utility as a system.


Proof, no, but then nobody can predict the future that accurately.  We can project from history that average block size grew from 300k five hundred days ago (16 and 2/3 months, which just happens to be the width of the tradeblock chart), to about 700k today.  The last few days shows a spike to 800k, but the data is noisy and that's too short a time to include it.
An accelerating curve seems to fit the data better than a linear one, with about 50% growth per 8 months.  That would put us at ~1.3 to 1.75 MB in 12-18 months, and your 1.6 MB capacity from SegWit is filled.  I don't think SegWit alone gives us enough growth margin.

That's obviously incorrect if you understand how the Internet works.  The DNS system has a few dozen root servers, who in turn supply addresses to many other DNS servers, and then millions and billions of routers who do most of the packet routing.  So it is quite possible to build a more decentralized network on top of a less decentralized core.  
To make that work, you need one-to-many connections at between layers, so the total number of connections fan out as you go up the layer stack, much like a tree branches from the trunk.
@_date: 2016-02-14 15:45:38
Yes.  At around 800 kB average block size we will start seeing confirmation delays, because block size and transaction count are statistical, it depends when the next block is found.  If you get a longer than average time between blocks, transactions will pile up for a while.  That's in addition to some miners just producing small blocks for propagation advantage.
We are already at 700 kB average block size, and it will take time to implement a fork, so the time is now, or suffer transaction constipation (blockage so to speak).

If you read the details of bank closures, the FDIC usually closes a bank *before* they are bankrupt, but when their finances are bad and getting worse.  What they usually do is take on the bank's bad assets at full value, then sell the bank to another bank.  By removing the bad assets, it makes the bank salable.  However, buying the bad assets is done at a loss by the FDIC.  They now have crappy loans worth less than what they paid out.  That's the expense to the insurance fund.
Since the branches are now just run by a different bank, customer access and accounts are not affected.  This is less disruptive than closing branches and forcing people to find a new bank.

As I pointed out above, one use is to verify some original data has not been changed since origination.  I will give another example.  Today, real estate property records (deeds, mortgages, etc.) are stored at 4000 local courthouses around the USA.  They are hard to access, and selling fractional ownership in a property has a lot of overhead costs.  
We already trust a centralized authority (courthouse clerks), but a distributed blockchain would be *more* accessible, since everyone can have a copy, *more* secure against property fraud and loss of paperwork (which happened a *lot* during the 2000's), and have lower costs.  Requiring digital signatures from all the parties in a sale + courthouse clerk prevents random changes, and the group of 4000 courthouses has an incentive to hash blocks **because that's their job and they collect transaction fees for each sale, just like they do now**
The bolded text answers your second question - what's the incentive to secure it?  Transaction fees, but the fees don't have to be internal to the block chain, they can be earned separately.
You need to think outside the box and realize there are other applications besides the first one that Nakamoto came up with.

No, it doesn't.  Most of the money supply is backed by debt.  If the debt is paid off, the money supply would have to contract.  Interest doesn't accumulate when it's paid.  I earn interest by way of a corporate bond fund, but then I spend it.  That includes paying down a mortgage.

Unfortunately, governments are not usually prudent, because they can spend more than they collect with few penalties.

I can read their articles with selective unblocking from NoScript and UBlock Origin, but if you worry about malware, you should just not visit them at all.  Here's the article text:
On Friday and Saturday, a group of key players in Bitcoin met in Hong Kong and came to an agreement over some questions that have divided the community for more than a year and caused it to split into factions.
The accord represented a first step in breaking through the impasse, and afterward, the currency, which had been rising over the previous week when the event details had been finalized, reached a value of around $430, a level last seen in mid-January.
It was then hostility over the debate reached critical levels when one of the most prominent developers declared Bitcoin a failure and announced he was quitting it altogether in a widely publicized blog post that coincided with a New York Times article. The currency immediately shed 15% of its value, demonstrating one of the persistent threats to the currency – the issue of governance. The fact that Bitcoin is not controlled by any one entity but by a sprawling group of developers and other economic actors means that it is not always obvious how problems will be resolved or who is responsible for resolving them.
However, the new statement by the group calling itself the Bitcoin Roundtable seems to point to a way forward for the community.
“There were a lot of arguments [during the Roundtable],” said Samson Mow, chief operating officer of BTCC, a China-based Bitcoin exchange and one of the organizers of the event, which had about two dozen attendees. “We are not like-minded individuals who all think the same thing. However, we do have an intent to work together, which is the differentiator.” He noted that the group had invited some members of other factions who declined to attend.
This commitment to finding common ground was echoed by Valery Vavilov, CEO of BitFury, a Bitcoin chip, hardware and mining company that currently accounts for about 10% of the network’s power, whose chief information officer attended: “For us it’s important not to decide on our own but to collaborate with other parties because this is the greatest open-source project ever,” he said.
The consensus reached by the Roundtable, which wrapped up its negotiations at 3:30am Saturday, presents one of the more definitive resolutions to the standoff, mainly because its members represent 80% of the network security and included five of Bitcoin’s developers (now called the Core team to differentiate them from the splinter groups) and other economic actors in the ecosystem such as exchanges.
Mow acknowledged that the agreement was very carefully worded to account for the concerns of the various Roundtable members and that the majority of the Core developers who were not present still needed to sign on to it, but he was confident that the plan represented the most likely outcome for Bitcoin moving forward.
“It’s futile to run Classic,” Mow said, referring to a new version of the software proposed by a splinter group. “This is done. This is over. Anyone who thinks otherwise is probably not going to be convinced of reality. They have their head in the sand and they will only believe what they want to believe.”
As Bitcoin has become more popular, transaction volume has increased, nearing the limit for the number of transactions that can be processed at any time in what is called “a block.” A few developers and large Bitcoin companies have proposed increasing each block’s cap, which is currently at 1 MB, even going so far as to launch new versions of the software themselves without first obtaining consensus amongst most of the developers and other Bitcoin stakeholders.
Ten days before this meeting, a new team of developers that broke off from the original group and calls itself Bitcoin Classic made another attempt to boost that cap — this time to 2 MB (previous proposals called for an 8 MB limit) — but within a day, the group of companies and players forming the Bitcoin Roundtable released a statement effectively rejecting the Classic team’s proposal. Their stance held weight because the companies behind it comprised enough network power to prevent the Classic version of the software from being implemented, despite the fact that Classic has the support of Coinbase, one of the most well-funded consumer-facing companies in the space. (Coinbase did not respond to requests for comment, but after the Roundtable agreement, CEO Brian Armstrong published a statement on Medium reiterating his support for an immediate block size increase to 2 MB and having miners “vote” on competing versions of the software by running the one they prefer.)
Over the weekend, the Roundtable convened in Hong Kong and sketched out a plan for increasing the network’s capacity that did not follow the Classic proposal. The Roundtable plans to implement a software change that separately processes some of the data currently in each block so that it does not contribute to the amount of data used toward the block limit. That effectively increases the number of transactions that the network can handle at any given time without actually increasing the block size.
The group also announced that it will release the software to increase the block size by July, and potentially activate that new software by July 2017. However, Vavilov, who prefers a quicker timeline, said, “I think July 2017 is likely a deadline. We think it could be done faster.”
Mow concurred: “In software development, not all dates are firm,” he said.
While on the surface, the debate seemed to be about the block size, it eventually became a power struggle, with the factions vying for control over the protocol. When asked why BitFury and other companies with a large portion of the network power decided to go with the Core team, Vavilov said, “For us, before we switch to another team, we need to understand if the existing team with the great experience who worked on this for many years can [upgrade the network]. For me, it would be good if Classic and Core could join forces and collaborate. Because of the Classic team, I think the Core team started to move slightly faster. The Classic team is good, but if Core can do this, why take the risk and switch?”
His comments echoed the sentiment of many of the Chinese companies that also account for a large portion of the computing power. In a previous article, I wrote about how cultural differences between China, where many of the miners are based, and the West, where many of the developers are from, are affecting Bitcoin’s progress. The Chinese Bitcoin community members I interviewed, while desiring a larger block size, were averse to switching to a new team. Some of Bitcoin’s bilingual community members surmised that those in the Chinese were not comfortable “voting” for different factions because they had grown up under China’s one-party political system.
For instance, Jack Liao, CEO of China-based Bitexchange and LightningASIC, told me then, “the Core developer team for the past two years did a great job and I trust them more than the Classic team,” mostly because they were new. (Liao signed the agreement this past weekend.)
Vavilov also said that other measures could be taken to help ease the problem of the transaction volume bumping up against the cap with other technological advancements currently in development, such as the Lightning network and side chains, that allow transactions to be processed not directly on the Bitcoin network, but connected to it.
“I think multiple competing teams are okay, but those teams should develop something but also somehow make consensus,” said Vavilov, then concluded. “But I think competition is good.”

Right now nodes are leading miners.  About 1/6 of nodes are in favor of some type of bigger block, and no miners are producing large blocks yet.  I expect that to continue.  Once miners see a strong majority among nodes, only then will they start to produce big blocks.  Otherwise their blocks will be rejected by the majority of nodes, and not propagate.

For Second Life (which has had a convertible digital currency for ten+ years), what they do is limit how much you can buy for new accounts, and monitor for "unusually rapid transactions" (which I have hit, because I used to be a major currency trader there).  If  you trip their monitor, your account gets frozen until you explain what you are up to.
The reason for these limits and triggers, plus taking 5 days to cash out via PayPal, is because people can and do buy game money with stolen credit card numbers.  The limits slow thieves down so the card owners have time to notice and report a problem.  I don't think it eliminates thieves entirely, just makes it not worth the trouble in most cases.
Question for original poster do you use two-factor authorization? (TXT to your cell phone, with a code number)?  I do, and Coinbase has worked fine after a first-time hitch, which was because I use a small credit union they had never heard of.

A major miner can easily afford gigabit service (hell, I could if it was offered where I live).  100 MB blocks then take about a second to relay.
Why should the whole world suffer if the major miners are located where labor and electricity is cheap, but they have bad internet service?  Their choices are sub-optimal, because the value of a bitcoin, and therefore the block reward, is limited by the number of transactions.
With a nearly fixed supply of coins and increased demand, the price of a coin must rise, by simple supply and demand.  But if increased demand is prevented by a block size limit, the price can't go up.

* Transactions only contain addresses being sent from and to, and the amount.  You need additional information to tie a transaction to a particular person.
* Bitcoins are not always converted to fiat currency.  They can be used to purchase products directly, or to pay for services.  The merchants are not required to collect personal information.  
* Services like Localbitcoins, and private transactions between people, can exchange bitcoin for cash fiat currency, and don't have to leave a record.
* Participants in mining pools don't always reveal who they are to the pool, just an IP and a BTC address to get paid.  
* You can sell your bitcoins without making a transaction, just reveal the private key to the buyer.  If they trust you sufficiently and you have legal safeguards, they don't *have* to move the coins by making a transaction, at least not right away.  
* "Mixing" coins takes many inputs from from different people, then redistributes them to new addresses in different amounts.  This makes it hard to associate a given output with a source.


If it's really a large sum of money, I suggest using the Private Banking division of a major bank.  They have people who specialize in that sort of thing, and lawyers and accountants that can help it look legitimate.  I would recommend HSBC, as they have a 150 year history of financing drug cartels, and print their own Hong Kong bank notes (HSBC originally was the HongKong and Shanghai Banking Corporation).  Newly printed bank notes are hard to trace when you get them directly from the bank.
If it's not quite so much money, go to an offshore haven with good bank secrecy laws and easy corporation set-up.  Open an account with a bitcoin exchange using a corporate bank account, and sell your coins that way.

My home node takes about 3 hours a month to keep the blockchain updated, and that's on crappy 6mbps AT&amp;T Uverse.  In theory I could increase the transactions handled by 240x, which implies 60 million tx/day.  Bitcoin consumes about 3 GB of hard drive space a month.  At recent hard drive prices, that's 7.5 cents.  If it cost as much as the fees on a checking account ($12/mo) it would start to be significant. So that's room for 160x increase.
If the number of tx increased by 100x, to pick a number, there would also be 100x as many users.  That means it would be much easier to find local users who could share the cost of a full node.  A good internet connection, workstation-grade PC, and lots of hard drives split among 100 users would still be very affordable, and the number of nodes does not change.

We had designs for that.  I went to work in Boeing's space systems division in 1981 and saw the drawings and reports still on the shelf.  The idea was to add wings, landing gear, and jet engines to the Saturn V first stage core.  So it would still have the same 5 F-1 engines, but then fly back to the launch site (300 miles) on jet power.  Boeing knew pretty well how to build things with wings and jet engines in the 70's.
Making the upper stage reusable could be delayed for a while, the first stage was the biggest cost item.  First stage recovery didn't require crazy heat shields, as the Falcon demonstrates.

This has happened repeatedly throughout history, because of a constant of human nature: people are more interested in themselves, their family, and their friends, than in everyone else.  In eras where security and comfort for you and those close to you required being rich and powerful, that became a goal.  Once you reached the goal, you then used any means necessary to maintain it: religion, armies, the legal system.  If the system wasn't suitable, you changed it, because the rich and powerful controlled the system.


That still happens in all too many countries.  A couple of recent examples are Libya and Egypt.  The leaders of those countries stole billions, and stashed most of it overseas against the day they would be overthrown.  But if you only milk the cattle, rather than slaughter them outright, you can keep things going longer.  Thus in developed countries, the rich and powerful don't take all your money or literally enslave you.  People tend to not work hard when that happens.  They leave you enough that you have some hope and incentive.  But they leech you with taxes and mortgage interest.

Well, go forth and discover it.  The point of bitcoin was to not require a third party, like when you use physical cash.  Thus the title of Satoshi's original paper described it as "electronic cash".
We have plenty of examples of third party systems, like credit cards.  A central point allows them to charge fees and refuse transactions.  What you call "wasted energy" I think of as "avoided fees".  Does the energy cost of running the Bitcoin network exceed the fees people would otherwise pay for the same transactions?  Will it continue in the same ratio?
You seem to have forgotten, like many people, that the block reward is not fixed.  It is currently much higher than bitcoin transaction fees.  But that will gradually change.  At each halving of the reward, miners will be able to afford less computation power relative to the transactions involved.  If transaction value were stable, energy consumption in mining would then go down.  It's likely transaction value will go up, though.

Let me preface this by saying I'm not a securities lawyer, I'm an engineer, so this is a layman's opinion
My understanding is that corporations *must* keep a registry of their owners (the shareholders) in order to carry out certain corporate functions.  Examples include paying dividends, mailing annual reports, announce shareholder meetings, and voting on mergers or buyouts.  Shares are often registered in the "Street name" of a broker (where street here means Wall Street), who then forwards the various information to the individual shareholders.  That's how my brokerage works.  Dividends show up in my brokerage account, and they forward paper reports to me.
If Overstock keeps track of some shares via a block chain type ledger, that ledger would still need to track actual owners somehow in order to carry out the various corporate functions I listed above.  Overstock is listed on the NASDAQ exchange and is publicly traded.  So things like annual reports and form 10-K are required by the SEC.  
I don't see how the owners of a corporation can be anonymous and unknown under US law.  You can certainly obfuscate it with a chain of offshore tax havens, but Overstock would know the first link in the chain as the "beneficial owner", and have them on their books as holding X shares.  Now, an offshore trust in Bermuda or Lichtenstein could in turn have anonymous shareholders, determined by private keys and a block chain.  That's out of the US, and thus not under SEC jurisdiction.

The source of funding isn't as important as gathering a bunch of really smart people and putting them to work on really hard projects.  New ideas and technology will be the fallout, some of which isn't directly part of the project.  An example is the WWW, which came out of the CERN particle accelerator projects, as a way to organize and link their physics data.
You may not realize that space industry today is $300 billion/year, of which NASA's budget is 6%.

The Dutch Tulip Mania of 1637 was not a fad, as evidenced by the Dutch still planting [tons of them]( four hundred years later.  Fads end.  The Dutch infatuation with tulips hasn't.
What happened in Holland was a "speculative bubble", which has happened in many other times and places.  Bubbles are caused by a "good story", greed, and the Dunning-Kruger Effect.  The classic stock market bubble of the [1920's]( had a story of how stocks could only go up, greed took over, and the D-K Effect drew in people who over-estimated their investing skill.  Bubbles follow a rather predictable pattern. Compare the 2006 [real estate bubble](  to the 1920's one in stocks.  You see an accelerating upward trend, followed by a crash.
But in neither stocks nor houses did people stop owning them or stop caring (see Hula Hoop and Pet Rocks for examples of fads that ended).  They merely stopped overpaying for them.  So the difference between a speculative bubble and a fad is whether it ends and people stop caring about it vs. got in a frenzy of overpaying but continued to own/use/care about the item afterwards.

I consulted a CPA and read up on the rules.  There is something called "constructive receipt".  For example, if you are on a monthly paycheck, you are earning every hour.  But you don't have constructive receipt of your earnings until the paycheck is in your hands or direct deposited.  At that point you can spend it on other things or cash it.
The same idea applied to Second Life.  So long as it was merely a balance in their accounts, I could not spend it elsewhere.  I received the funds for tax purposes the moment PayPal notified me of the transfer from Second Life to my PayPal balance.  At that point I could transfer it to checking, or spend it elsewhere, like on Ebay.
For Coinbase and their exchange, it would depend what you can do with your exchange balance.  If you have bitcoins there, and can spend it anywhere that has an address, then the funds are "in your hands", and it would have been a taxable gain or loss if you traded previously.  If you have to request a transfer from the exchange to your coinbase wallet, and *then* can send it to any bitcoin address, and Coinbase at their discretion might say no, then the funds are not in your control yet.
As the sad history of Mt.Gox demonstrates, if the funds are not under your control, they might never show up.  So they are not yours yet to do with as you wish.
Caveat: I'm an engineer, and not a tax attorney.  I reported my Second Life trading on my tax return, but I also have a spreadsheet documenting every trade.  Since 2006 they haven't asked for that level of detail or questioned my return.

Publicly traded corporations typically have a transfer agent and registrar like [Computershare]( who keep track of who owns how many shares, and transfers of stock from person to person.  In the old days, the share Registry was (dun dun dun!) a paper ledger.  Share certificates were numbered, and you transferred them by signing them on the back to the new owner, sending it to the registrar, who would issue a new certificate in the new owner's name.
Nowadays, share certificates hardly ever move.  Most of them are kept by the Depository Trust Company, and brokers have an undivided interest in the pile of certificates according to how many shares their customer accounts have.  When one user sells shares and someone with a different broker buys them, they just update the (dun dun dun!) electronic ledger to reflect the new broker balances.
The legality of a block-chain type ledger depends on meeting whatever rules the SEC imposes on shareholder certificates and records.


You sign it over to them, then the registrar would issue a new certificate in their name.  This is similar to how car titles are transferred.  But most certificates these days are in the name of the DTC and stay in their vault.  When people buy and sell through a broker, the DTC just updates how many shares each broker holds, and the broker in turn keeps track of how many go with each customer account.

Yes, and why not so?  
A chain of hashed data blocks can be used internally within an organization to secure the data against accidental corruption or malicious tampering.  Bitcoin additionally makes the data public and distributed, allowing anyone to add data and make the blocks secure.  It also is designed to operate without a trusted third party.  But those features are optional. You can design other forms of data storage with varying numbers of parties allowed to add data, access the data, level of centralization vs. distribution etc.
By comparison, the bittorent protocol uses SHA1 hashes of the "pieces" of the data as checksums, to verify each piece was transferred correctly.  But the metadata (.torrent file) containing these hashes isn't itself secured.  So a malicious person could change the contents of the data, and the corresponding hash, and deliver altered data.  Chaining data blocks (or pieces) by including the hash of one block as data in the next makes this sort of tampering harder.  It also places the data in sequence, which is useful for things like data logs, ledgers, or record-keeping systems.
You can increase the security against tampering or data corruption by adding a random number to each block, and requiring the hash result to meet a test.  Bitcoin does this because it is a public, distributed system involving financial transactions.  The incentive for tampering is thus high, and so is the opportunity, because anyone can participate in the Bitcoin network.  The difficulty of tampering therefore also has to be high, so as to keep it a minor risk.
But in other applications with different risk profiles, using an auto-adjusting Proof-of-Work difficulty may be overkill.  I expect some gut-level reaction from people who are convinced that the bitcoin way is the only way to use a block chain.  As my discussion above indicates, I think not.  If you think otherwise, please point to a white paper or discussion that shows the reasoning why.  Gut reactions and arm-waving won't convince me, or the growing number of financial institutions and software houses that think otherwise.
(Please note, a block chain can still be a solution for a data storage problem while not being the most efficient solution.  I recognize that.  But without metrics to compare it to the alternatives, you don't really know what the best solution is for a given application.)

A blockchain is just a series of data blocks, each of whose contents are validated by a hash, and that hash value included in the next block.  That puts the blocks in sequential order.  If the hashes are hard to calculate, that also makes the contents hard to change.  A change requires recalculating all the hashes after the change, because they are linked.
Bitcoin happens to use financial transactions as the data in the blocks, but that isn't required.  You could generate hashes from the stream of body-mounted police camera video, put all the hashes from all the cops into blocks every ten minutes, and make a chain.  Then you can prove that a particular chunk of recorded video hasn't been altered.  
More generally, any kind of data whatsoever can be validated as unchanged using a blockchain.  It just happens that financial transactions are a good use case for unchangeable data, but far from the only use.

The same way we have hundreds of altcoins based on modification of the original bitcoin code.  In this case, classic bitcoin would just be a continuation of the current version, and the big block version would share the same chain up to a particular block number.  After that it includes a flag to denote the blocks are a different version with different limits, and you get a hard fork with divergent chains.  Users choose which chain to follow by which software they run.  You can delay a decision till the next time you need to make a transaction, but by default if you are running older software you are on the classic chain.
Personally, I think migration will happen to the big gulp chain, because it would have lower transaction fees than the classic chain.  Even if you didn't hard-fork bitcoin, people will migrate to alt-coins with lower fees.  It's not like there is a shortage of them.

Intrinsic value is a flawed concept.  Value is subjective.  An easy way to see that is a grocery store selling apples at a given price.  The store must value dollars higher than the apples, else they would not be willing to trade away the apples.  Customers must value the apples more than dollars, else they would not purchase them.  Trade can only happen when both parties value what the other person has more than what they have themselves.
Not only is value subjective, it varies for a single person over time.  I used to buy a lot of books (I have 3,500 of them now).  Nowadays I'm gradually giving them away, because electronic texts have more value.
Paper money, or a delivery truck, have "utility value", because some people find them useful.  Paper money, like most types of money, solves the "coincidence of wants" problem of barter.  It also solves the portability problem of commodity money.  It's also useful for the underground economy because it has a hard to follow trail.  But other forms of money may solve these problems better, and other problems besides, and thus have more utility for more people.  The usefulness of paper money then decreases on a relative basis.

Let's assume bitcoin usage grows by a factor of 100 over what it is now (~2 tx/s) in the next 10 years.  So each block will need to contain 50 MB, and a month's worth will require 216 GB.  A new hard drive a year can cover that.  Since you need to receive and send data on a full node, then bandwidth will need to be 432 GB/month.  If you have a crappy ISP, that would exceed your monthly allowance.  In 10 years it might be normal to have that much.
Beyond that scale, the answer is to host a dedicated server in a data center.  If there are 100 times as many transactions, that means there are also 100 times as many users.  So put up a web page, and take subscriptions in BTC to access your node.

But the value of the reward doesn't have to be internal to the blockchain itself.  Let me give an example:
There is obvious value in secure records of property ownership, business contracts, and creative works.  An association forms for the purpose of keeping such records.  They collect fees from people for incorporating the records into a block chain.  They pay out some of the fees to miners for finding block hashes.  The level of trust here is that of operating a bitcoin mining pool.  As long as the payouts happen on schedule, everyone is happy.  
The blockchain is distributed because there are many miners, including some of the association members.  If what you want is a "distributed, trustless blockchain", then the reward needs to be internal to the chain.  But that is different than just being distributed.  You can achieve distributed with some level of trust, as the existence of mining pools demonstrates.  It's a low level of trust, because as soon as payouts stop happening, everyone will know and leave.

No.  This is a question of contract law.  Contracts can be verbal.  In the case of a restaurant, their menu is their offer - what kinds of food and what prices.  You accept their offer when you tell the waiter what you want.  At that point a contract has been made, which is an exchange of promises.  They promise to bring you food and you promise to pay for it.
What remains now is to execute the contract.  They bring the food, you eat it, thus accepting delivery.  What remains is your promise to pay.
Some contracts require it be in writing, for example selling real estate.  Others don't require it, but it's a really good idea to get it in writing.  Federal and state law identify when it is required.

Please don't repeat this, it's wrong.  Metallic asteroids have relatively high concentrations of Platinum-group metals, because those metals are "siderophile" (iron-loving), and those asteroids are from the metallic cores of large asteroids that later were broken up.
On Earth, most of the Platinum group metals sank to the core along with most of the Iron, so they are relatively very rare. Gold is just one of the precious metals to be found in Asteroids.  Platinum is actually more common, and a lot of the market value is in others like Palladium.
Note that "relatively high concentrations" means ~15 parts per million, so you would have to process a million tons of iron-nickel alloy to get 15 tons of precious metals out.
There's more value in water, fuel, radiation shielding, and other bulk products from asteroid rock, because those occur in concentrations of 20% or more, and the cost of lifting *anything* from Earth is thousands of dollars per kilogram.  Precious metals would be a sideline business.

A hash is a checksum derived from some data content.  It is commonly used to check that the data has not been changed.  For example, when you download some software, the hash value you derive from your download can be compared to the published hash value for the file. That will confirm that no data errors occurred during download, and that no malicious person tampered with the files (such as adding malware)
In the example I gave, the hash would be of the video file's content.  You can place that on the block chain by encoding it as the output address of a small bitcoin transaction.  Transactions always require signing with the private cryptographic key for the sender's address. That proves they sent the transaction.  The bitcoin protocol allows multi-signature transactions, which require multiple people to approve a transaction.  For this example, those people would be members of the Bitcoin Foundation, who are implicitly saying "this video is a true record of our meeting, and this is the hash value from the video".  Then anyone can check the hash value matches the downloaded video.
A simple way to think of it is that private keys allow digitally signing transactions, but in this case, the destination address (output) from the transaction is a file hash, instead of an actual address. 


A block chain is a series of data blocks, whose contents are verified by hash values.  The hash value of the previous block is part of the data in the current block, thus linking them in order - each block can verify the contents of the one before.  In principle, the data can be of any kind whatsoever.  In the case of the first application of a block chain, which is Bitcoin, that data is a set of financial transactions. But you can shove some other data into the Bitcoin block chain by substituting part of a transaction's data, or create a different block chain designed for general data storage, rather than financial transaction storage.


The Bitcoin block chain intentionally makes it hard to find the hash value of the next block, by requiring that hash value to be very low.  So there is an extra number, called the "nonce", which is randomly varied and included in the block data, until someone finds a sufficiently low hash.  This process is called "Proof of Work", because there is no other way of finding the right hash except by trying lots of nonces. The Bitcoin network has an absurdly high amount of work required to find the next block hash.  In fact, it is by far the most intense computational process in the world.  To change the data in the block chain would require re-doing all that computational work, from the point you want to change forward, because all blocks are linked to the one after it.
This keeps the contents of Bitcoin transactions very secure.  If you adapt a transaction to hold some other data, that data is also very secure, by virtue of the massive computation power thrown at the block chain.

You can spend bitcoins at any willing merchant, of which there are about 100,000, or trade them to other individuals like myself.  Bitcoins are moved via a p2p network.  There isn't a centralized market, but rather a distributed ledger (the block chain) that everyone can have a copy of or access, and anyone can validate the contents.
There *are* exchanges, who specialize in trading bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, and national currencies, for each other.  They are similar to foreign exchange traders who only trade among national currencies.  But you don't have to use an exchange.  You can trade bitcoin with anyone who will take them, the way you can trade dollars for euro on the streets of Paris with anyone who accepts dollars.
Lets say you are a programmer in India.  You may wish to accept dollars and euro, because it expands your business possibilities beyond just India.  But foreign exchange and international funds transfer is slow and has high fees.  Bitcoin can travel around the world as easily as to the person in front of you.  So you might have a good use case in that situation.
If you are in the US, get paid by direct deposit, and shop with a debit card or online with a credit card, you already are served well and the fees are pretty low (and mostly hidden, the merchant pays the transaction fees, but then raises their prices to cover it).  You may not be a good use case right now.  But that does not exclude other people for having good reasons to use bitcoin.

The land area of the US, Canada, and Mexico combined is just over 21 million square km.  Let's round down to 21 million, because that's how many bitcoins will be mined eventually.  So think of a full bitcoin as equivalent to 1 square km.  The smallest amount tracked on the blockchain is then equivalent to a 10x10 cm plot.
Bitcoins never go anywhere any more than the land in North America does.  They stay on the blockchain, and only change ownership.  But just like land, bitcoins can be divided into smaller pieces of arbitrary size, and recombined into larger pieces.
There is a smallest transaction amount that the network will process, but it is like 54 micro-bitcoins last time I looked (~1.3 cents US). Bitcoin ATMs may set minimum dollar amounts, but that's up to them, it's not inherent in how the network operates.

Whoever made that estimate is wrong.  Ireland averages 5.8 GW of electric consumption.  Antminer S7, which are new mining devices, can run the current network hash rate for 110 MW.  If we assume the average existing mining hardware is half as efficient, we get 220 MW for the entire network.  
Alternately, as a first approximation, we can estimate that miners as a whole don't spend more on electricity than the mining rewards are worth.  The rewards are 25 btc x ~$240/btc x 6 block per hour, or $36,000 per hour.  At a wholesale price of $0.05/kWh, we then get 720,000 kWh/h = 720,000 kW = 720 MW.  That's an upper bound.  If you factor in a profit margin and the discounted life of the mining hardware ($4500 to $10,000/hr), they can probably not expend more than half that power, giving 360 MW.  
Splitting the estimates we get 290 MW, which is less than Ireland by a factor of 20.  It's roughly the power used by the urban area of Cork, Ireland's second largest city.  Critics of bitcoin's power use always seem to forget that the reward drops in half every 4 years, which means so does the income from mining, aside from price variation.  Less income means less mining power used to earn that income.

Not the license itself, but the "starting capital" is measured in millions.  In other words, you have to put up millions of your own money before you can start taking other people's money in deposits.  After starting up, you have to maintain a "capital reserve" (8% in the US).  That reserve for normal banks is intended to be a cushion against bad loans or other losses, so that depositor money isn't lost.  Once in a while, that happens anyway, so FDIC insurance is backup for when a bank does so badly their reserves are not enough.
A well run bank earns a profit, which increases their reserves.  That allows them to accept more outside deposits.

Well, the obvious solution is to fork the Bitcoin project and have each version optimized for the different requirements.  Classic Bitcoin can keep relatively small blocks. They don't have to stay 1.00 MB forever, due to progress in computers and networking, but they can track that progress to stay within ordinary PC or small server capacity. Big Gulp Bitcoin (I'm explicitly avoiding the XT name, because of the strong feelings people have about it) allows blocks to scale faster, which in turn requires other software and hardware changes to support it.


I've said this before.  If the block chain grows 100x, that means there are 100 times more users.  Those users can chip in to support a bigger and faster node, and you end up with the same number as we have today.  *How* they chip in is an implementation detail.  Maybe my local credit union hosts one for its members.  Maybe someone sets up a turn-key node package that runs on any hosted server, including a website and subscription service for users to pay the hosting cost (in BTC of course).  The underlying point is if you have lots of transactions, then you also have lots of users who can share the cost of a node.

Finding a checksum (hash value) for a block of transactions, so that anyone can check that their copy of the transaction history is the same as everyone else's.  It's making a secure record.  Blocks also include the hash value of the previous block.  So if a change to an old transaction is made, the hash of the block it is in will no longer match the value recorded in the next block.  So not only is the current record secured, all past records are also secured.
Digital data that nobody can mess with is the great invention in Bitcoin.


Paper money dollars are generated by debt backing at the Federal Reserve, mostly Treasury bonds and agency mortgage securities.  In effect they are merely debts in convenient round amounts.
Bitcoin gets its value a different way, by being useful.  So it is more similar to a car or a lumber 2x4.  Things that are useful don't need backing by something else.  But the usefulness of Bitcoin is not just the entries in the transaction history (blockchain).  It is the entire Bitcoin Network of custom hardware, network nodes, software, apps, exchanges, stores and users.  The network is what enables you to make new transactions and therefore move value from person to person.  The total of all the current entries is fairly fixed - transactions only move them from one address to another.  The value per unit entry (a bitcoin, as the unit of account) then depends mostly on demand for them at any given time, vs the supply available from sellers.


It works because of decentralized trust.  The blockchain (transaction history) is secured in such a way that no single person can muck with the contents, and new transactions can only be made with a private cryptographic key.  So you can trust that a balance you have now will still be there in the future.  In monetary terms this makes it a "store of value".  Because new bitcoins are created on a finite and predictable schedule, you don't have to worry about inflation, unlike central banks who can make more currency whenever they feel like it.  Bitcoins are scarce, and will remain scarce.
The mechanics of how the network works is that new transactions are broadcast across the peer-to-peer network of nodes.  Each node checks the transactions against the past history, to make sure the sender had funds to send, plus other technical checks, like digital signature is correct.  If a transaction fails any check, it does not get passed along.  Each node is checking against its own copy of the blockchain, so no single malicious faker can get very far.  Miners are also nodes, and check incoming transactions.  But they also try and solve the block hash, because they get 25 (currently) new bitcoins if they do.  Then all the other nodes verify the new block is good, and remove the included transactions from their "memory pool" of "new transactions that are good, but not yet in a block".
@_date: 2015-11-09 16:27:20


They don't have to.  They work on finding a new block in parallel.  First one to find it wins the reward.  The network distributes the new-found block to everyone.


The blockchain is the one source, but everyone has a copy.  Miners also accumulate transactions to put in a block.  They do that by also being nodes, like the rest of the network.

Not necessarily.  The mining reward is currently 25 bitcoins per block, and it gets cut in half every 4 years or so.  Therefore there is less incentive to mine in terms of bitcoins.  In terms of dollars it depends how much the value of 1 bitcoin changes over time.
Once mining chips reach the limits of semiconductor technology, and enough people are doing it that nobody makes a profit (cost of chips + electricity = reward), there is no incentive to increase mining effort further.

I was poking fun at their headline, because the WSJ has put a paywall on their website, making it hard for readers to access it.
but here is how I work things:
Specialist publications *have* to be accurate about their specialty, because their audience will know if they make mistakes.  Therefore I trust the WSJ to report corporate earnings and other financial news correctly.  When they stray from their specialty, into politics, or in this case editorial speculation on a new technology, I don't trust them so much.  In fact, the "debate" in the original article is between two economics professors, hardly a balanced situation.  It would be like having a debate between a policeman and FBI agent about drug enforcement.
So rather than putting my trust in a single publication, I have a list of links to various specialist sources on different topics of interest.  I read each for their topic of specialty, and ignore general news media entirely.  They are specialists in *nothing* and not worth the bother.  It's the same principle as hiring contractors.

The Chinese wanted to get paid in silver, but the Pound Sterling was actual sterling sliver coins at the time.  Foisting opium on the Chinese was a way to balance trade.

Several years back I was active in the Open Source Ecology project, but it was disorganized and had not addressed several key questions, like which machine you build first, and what size they need to be.  So I set up the Seed Factory Project partly to address those questions.  The "seed" is the core starter set you use to build the other machines.  
They seem to have gotten more organized lately, so I may get involved again, but our goals are similar.  My work is open source also.
Living in a city is not a barrier to working on such projects.  I bought a 2.67 acre property near Atlanta to do R&amp;D and prototyping, but I'm not doing it alone.  People like yourself who don't have workshop space or tools can come here to build things.  We will also be working with community workshops (a.k.a. hackerspaces or makerspaces) like [Freeside Atlanta]( who have tools we don't have.  In return their members can use our property, because they are in an industrial warehouse and don't have room for outdoor or larger projects.
Individuals can't feasibly build and operate a whole seed factory or GVCS, that's why "village" is part of the latter's name.  Rather, individuals or small groups can build one or a few machines each and trade with others, or larger groups can set up community workshops.

I'm personally in favor of a more gradual increase in block size, such as doubling every 105,000 blocks (~2 years), starting with the next reward halving.  That's easy to program, and allows miners to gradually shift to fees as the block reward goes down.

At its core, Bitcoin has a single agreed transaction ledger (the block chain).  "A bitcoin" is just what we call 1.0000... units on the ledger.  A lot of people don't get that.  But you could create a block chain whose unit is a dollar, or other existing currency.  There would have to be a different way of adding new units to the ledger, and a different incentive for solving blocks.  But hard-to-find hashes can still secure the transaction history from tampering, which is what matters to banks.  It is not necessary to have a trustless system, because banks on the whole trust each other.  They have to, since they are all part of the same worldwide banking system that settles transactions for their respective customers.

Here's a radical idea: use a blockchain.  Members and contributors get proxycoins, which they can assign to whomever they wish, including themselves.  Above a threshhold of proxies, you are part of the board.
Policies get addresses.  Assign your proxycoins to whichever policy you like, but it's a 2 out of 3 escrow, so you can take the proxycoin back if you find something better to assign it to.  Tallying which policies have the most coins assigned is trivial.
It's then easy to compare an organization's or board member's activity vs the current assigned proxies.  If they are not following the members/contributors wishes, revoke their proxies, and they fall off the board.

It's not completely unknown.  The problem is when the interest on the debt gets so large, you get runaway growth of the debt itself.  There is only so much that can be done politically to squeeze other spending or raise taxes, and if the debt keeps growing, eventually interest compounds exponentially.  Since the world has a finite appetite to buy the debt, they have to offer higher interest rates to sell it, which only makes things worse.
We don't know exactly when the problem becomes uncontrollable, but economists can make reasonable estimates, and look at part experience in other countries.  As long as the national debt is growing faster than the economy in real terms (after inflation), you will eventually reach the run-away point.

This is widely misunderstood and incorrect.  See table 7 of the Federal Reserve's [current balance sheet](  A "Federal Reserve Note" (FRN) is the official name for paper [U.S. money]( it says so right on them.  These notes are backed by collateral: a small amount of gold certificates, and a lot of Treasury, US agency, and mortgage securities debt.  If you are a bank that was issued FRN's for circulation, you can return them and get your collateral back.  An individual can fairly easily swap their paper money for the same kinds of debt used as collateral.
Thus they are not "IOU nothings".  They are debt-backed money, and exchangeable back for the debt which backs them.  However, the debt securities typically have denominations of $1000 or higher, and FRN denominations of 1 to 100 dollars are more convenient for daily transactions.  We can debate whether debt-backed currency is a good idea, but you cannot say that debt is nothing. It's a claim on future goods and services which can be traded for other things you want.

No.  The Bitcoin Investment Trust is designed to only hold bitcoins, and derive the market value from the price of bitcoins.  What you are thinking of is a hedge fund or other active trading fund, rather than a simple "holding bitcoins" fund like this.

I don't think the average user has increased their transactions 30-fold (I know I haven't).  A particular user has a use case for which bitcoin works well, be it shopping online, or remitting funds overseas.  Once that use case is satisfied, they are not going to increase their remittance frequency 30-fold.  It seems more likely that will be static once they start doing it.  When another use case becomes viable, they may add more transactions at that time.

Sadly, I'm an aerospace engineer, not a political or social engineer.  That's why I consider the idea 2% baked (1/25th of half baked).  But we know a blockchain can provide transparency, and we can escrow transactions.  Traditional voting is irrevocable.  Once a politician gets your vote, they can do whatever the fuck they want until the next election.  A revocable proxy forces them to pay more attention, since you can take it away if they are not doing what you want.
The complicated part from my standpoint is policies vs people to implement the policies.  It's easy to vote for a political party or candidate because their stated policies line up with what you want.  It's harder to be sure they will follow such policies afterwards.  Reward bounties is one way to do that. There may be other mechanisms that do a better job, but it's not my field of expertise.

I would turn it around and ask how a group of men from the late 18th century could contractually bind a free people for all time.  
The ratifiers of the US Constitution were the state houses of the 13 colonies, representing a set of voters who elected them.  Certainly those people who participated at the time could agree to a set of common rules.  But could they bind people who weren't even born yet to follow those rules?  I would say they could not, because making rules for other people isn't a natural right.
If someone today voluntarily decides to join and follow a set of rules, that's fine.  But *forcing* them to do so by an accident of where they were born is no better than the situation of medieval serfs.

Of course, being underground, it is only an estimate.  The definition here is "not reported to the IRS".  There are two components to this.  The first is the "black market", which is illegal, and unreported.  That includes drugs, prostitution, loan sharking, counterfeit goods, etc.  The second is the "off the books" economy.  Those items are legal, but unreported.  So the guy you hire from Craigslist to help you move, and pay in cash, may be off the books.  So is a contractor who does both on-the-books work (paid by check, and traceable), and side off-the-books work (paid in cash, or trade) and not traceable.  Legitimate small businesses have to report *some* of their income, or it looks suspicious.  But that doesn't mean they report all of their income.

Re the last paragraph:
Formally, a "seed factory" is a starter kit of machines capable of upgrading itself by:
* Replication - making parts for exact copies of existing machines,
* Diversification - making parts for new machines not in the starter kit, but the plans may be stored in memory or supplied from outside, and
* Scaling - making parts for different sized machines than the original starter kit.  These methods may be combined.
The starter kit does not have to be able to make 100% of its own parts, especially not at first, and does not have to be 100% automated at first.  The main feature is the ability to upgrade over time to higher capabilities.  The seed part of the name comes from how an acorn is the seed that grows into a tree.  Acorns don't copy themselves directly.  They first grow to a higher capability, and *then* make copies.
A seed factory is more of a concept than a building.  You *can* locate the machines in one place for convenience, but another option is a distributed factory.  That's where different machines are in different places, with different owners, but collaborate electronically.  This is what makes it on-topic for - In a distributed version, payments to each owner can be via escrowed bitcoin transactions.  As each one finishes their part of the work, the payment gets released.  In an ideal version, distribution of parts files and payments can all be automated.
As the seed factory upgrades, it can make more and more of its own parts, and have more robots and automation.  At the start, though, you will need to purchase parts and materials, and use manual labor when necessary.
What goes in the starter kit depends on where you are using it and what the desired final products are.  The prototype version we are working towards includes [8 machines]( plus making attachments for them to be more flexible, and some conventional workshop tools.  
We are nowhere near done with the work on this idea, but a goal for the "Personal Factory" version is individuals in a metropolitan area can split up the cost for the starter kit. Then they start to upgrade to where they can produce most of their physical needs (food, shelter, utilities, etc) and enough surplus to trade for the stuff they can't make.  If the end-version expanded factory is mostly automated, their needs are taken care of without a lot of work.  This answers the question of "what do we do when robots take our jobs?" with "we have our own robots (and other machines) and don't need a job."  I think that is a better answer than Basic Income, which some people are proposing.  Basic Income leaves you at the mercy of whoever collects taxes and sends out the payments.  If you have your own production ability, you are not at the mercy of some politician or bureaucrat.

I agree that the value of a given bond is [quite variable]( (value varies inversely with interest rates), and government bonds have often gone to zero.

This is exactly right.  In developing [seed factories]( - self upgrading automated production, I use the concept of "resource accounting".  That means tracking things like energy and raw materials into and out of a factory, not just money.  In order for the factory to function, the books have to balance on *all* the resources consumed.  If you don't produce that resource in-house, then it has to be supplied from outside.
Resource accounting can be handled with the same tools as money accounting, like spreadsheets.  The meaning of the numbers you enter is just different, kWh electricity or kg of steel instead of dollars or BTC.

What do you think they are trying to do via the NYDFS "Bitlicense" effort?  Financial services and banks are a huge part of New York State's economy, because Wall Street is located there.  Something that threatens that industry is a threat to New York's economy and tax base, so of course a department of New York State is going to try and stop it.  Their chosen tool is red tape in the form of regulations.
However, every other jurisdiction that isn't a banking center can look at Bitcoin as a benefit to consumers, and banking centers that aren't Wall Street can see it as a way to steal business by becoming more efficient.  So a single location imposing excessive regulation isn't going to have much effect in the long run.

As someone who lost a lot of money not just from bond ratings, but actual fraud (the bond fund operator lied about the market price of the bonds, thus misrepresenting the fund Net Asset Value.  $262 million in restitution from the bank only covered 20% of investor losses), I can assure you this will not happen again until the current generation of investors are dead.  Not only were ratings done with incorrect risk models and arm twisting, many fraudulent mortgages were created.  Either the value of the property was inflated, or the borrower's income, or both.  Investors weren't informed of the "tranche" structured finance method (i.e. being in 14th place to get payouts almost guaranteed you got nothing), and sometimes the fund operators even lied about the value of their holdings.  The whole system was corrupted, from start to finish.
But having been burned in the 2007 collapse and recession, people are much more wary of what they are investing in, and know what to look for.  At least until people die and don't pass on their experience.  The same thing happened in the 1920's leading to the Great Depression, and earlier speculative bubbles.  But it seems every generation has to learn the same lessons over.

Courthouses have burned down in the past, destroying the records they contain.  A distributed database is more secure in that aspect.  4000 county records offices are also hard to search by anyone outside their offices.  So making it public makes it more useful.  Using a block chain makes verifying the integrity of the data easy for anyone who wants to check.  One of the functions of the records clerk is to time-stamp deeds and other paperwork as it comes in, to establish priority in who bought a property.  This is the same kind of task as preventing double-spending.  You might call it "preventing double-selling" of a given property.  A single checksum/hash is OK for static data, like a file download.  Where the data is constantly added to, and the sequence of data matters, a series of chained hashes (which is what a block chain uses) is better.
For some reason, a lot of people have a hard time understanding this.  There are other kinds of data besides financial ones that you want to be distributed, verifiable, and have timestamps.  But not all of them need to be trustless, or open to the world to add new transactions/records.  And the technical details will vary by use.  Bitcoin transactions are small in number of data bits, and frequent.  Property sales are large in data content, and infrequent.  So a separate system designed for that purpose makes sense.

Every 210,000 blocks, the block reward gets cut in half.  It started at 50 btc/block.  Now it's 25, next year it will drop to 12.5, etc.
50 + 25 + 12.5 + .... = 100.  100 x 210,000 = 21 million.  It has a limit because mathematically it is the sum of a convergent series.


The blockchain.  All bitcoins exist there and only there.  The first transaction in each block is the miner rewarding themselves with new coins, plus transaction fees from the other transactions.  After coins are created, the only thing they can do is move to new addresses.  So the total amount doesn't change except for that first transaction each time.


The record is the blockchain.  It's a history of every bitcoin transaction, ever.  Control resides in the private keys that individuals keep secret.  You need that key to make a new transaction moving coins to a new address.


5400 network nodes, all enforcing "the rules" contained in the bitcoin software.  If a miner attempts to include an incorrect number of new coins in their block, the block gets rejected by everyone.  Every bitcoin, or fraction thereof, has a history that can be traced by looking at the blockchain, which each node keeps a copy of.  
A transaction that attempts to "double spend" a coin will fail.  The first transaction to arrive moves that coin to a new address.  The second one will be invalid because the sending address no longer has the coin to send.  Keeping a consensus accounting ledger (the blockchain) of which address has what coins keeps it honest.  Everyone checks everything.  Distributed parallel real-time accounting.  You would have to subvert the majority of nodes to even insert fake bitcoins.  But even then, the remaining people would notice and raise a stink.

That's one reason I am working on [Seed Factories]( - starter sets of automated machines, that make parts for *more* machines to expand their capabilities, and eventually end products for people to use directly.  With modern networking, the starter set can be distributed, as long as they can communicate who needs to make what.
Example: You buy into a starter set partnership, which grows to where it can make robo-farm tractor parts and implements, which then grows food for the partners.  You don't need a retirement fund or Social Security to keep you going if the factory is supplying all the basics (food, shelter, utilities, etc.)
This also solves the "robots took my job" problem.  If you own the robots (or a share in them), it is not a problem.  They just work for you now.  One of the starter set elements is a modular robot (wheeled chassis, various arms and attachments, camera &amp; sensor set, battery pack), and you would manufacture more robots as part of the expansion.

Foolish applies to the American people in general, who have it on faith that Fort Knox is full of gold.  You would think they would demand regular inventories, but you would be wrong.

I have yet to see a county records office that would qualify as a well-run IT department.  Better to have an overabundance of integrity in the data itself, and rely less on the competence of the individuals involved.  Also, property records need to be kept an unusually long time (centuries), so a well-run department would have to stay well run for that long.  Again, it would be better if you could verify the blocks 100 years later, using none of the original equipment.  All you need is 1 copy of the data itself to survive.

It's almost like you don't understand how banks make their money.  They expect to collect a trillion dollars per year in transaction fees by the end of the decade.  They would not have to create new tokens like bitcoin does.  They can go straight to fees as the only incentive.  And with a closed system (only banks), they get to retain the fees themselves.
Bitcoin also has transaction fees, but they are a minor incentive right now.  We generate new coins as both a way to fairly distribute the original tokens (according to who does work), and as an *early* incentive to bootstrap the system.  But the reward will go to zero with bitcoin, and rely on fees alone.  Banks don't need to bootstrap, they have plenty of customers and assets.

Things that are useful have "utility value" in themselves, not based on anything else.  Commodity money (like gold, silver, etc.) solved the "coincidence of wants" problem of barter.  Both parties in barter have to want what the other person has.  That's hard to find.  It's easier to make two trades using an acceptable intermediary.  Then you only need to find someone who wants what you have, and you accept the intermediary.  Later you trade the intermediary for what you originally wanted.  It's easier to find people who meet a single trade condition than two in barter.  Gold has other properties like not tarnishing and it's pretty, that enhance its acceptability as an intermediary.  So it ended up at the top of the list, historically.
The utility of bitcoin comes from the *network*, not the units recorded on the blockchain.  Without nodes, miners, wallet software, users, etc., the blockchain would be insecure and pretty static, and thus low value.  You need some units to make use of the network.  So the usefulness of the network creates a demand for the units, and their price is set by supply and demand.
U.S. currency is almost entirely backed by debt, both the circulating notes (paper money) and deposits at banks.  A $1000 treasury bond or a car loan is not very useful to pay for coffee.  Paper money or a debit card works better for such transactions.  But really you are holding fractional claims to some pile of debt.  Fiat currency has utility as a convenience, and also because it has mandated uses (paying off debts and taxes), but it is a different kind of entity than a transaction network.

Pickering was absolutely correct as far as he went.  The formula for drag force is:
D = 0.5C(d)(rho)(A)(v^2 ) where v is velocity.
What he neglected is drag coefficient, C(d), could be vastly reduced from that of cloth-covered biplanes by use of smoother wing materials, streamlined fuselage, and swept-back wings.  He also neglected that air density, rho, decreases with altitude.  That's one reason why aircraft cruise way up there.
Of course, thrust, which must equal drag in level flight, also vastly increased from the small piston engines in the early airplanes.
The moral of the story?  Don't neglect the other multiplying factors in a process.

[They have both]( - See table 5.  It's a bit more than half treasuries, and a bit less than half "agency" mortgage securities (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae)


Unlike the banks they oversee, the Fed has no leverage limit.  If you divide total assets by capital, they are leveraged 77:1.  When they buy a treasury bond or MBS from a member bank, they just credit that bank's account with the Fed.  You will note the entry for "other deposits held by depository institutions" (i.e. banks) is more than half of total liabilities.  They have been doing a lot of crediting bank's accounts.
The magic part is the Fed carries the mortgage securities at face value, regardless of how crappy the underlying mortgages are.  This lets the banks off the hook, because their checking account at the Fed is always counted at full value.  If the Fed listed the MBS and treasuries at market value, they would probably have negative capital.


The construction market (homes and commercial buildings) got overbuilt.  The collapse of that market, and all the secondary ones that depend on it (building materials, real estate agencies, the stores that construction worker's families shop at) caused 6% more of the workforce to become unemployed.  Buying up bad mortgages from the agencies that make MBSs kept them from going under.  Those agencies are necessary to support home finance.  It took several years for the oversupply of houses to get used up, but now people are building and buying again, and that part of the economy is working.
Low interest rates encourages people and businesses to borrow.  Buying products increases demand, and expanding factories increases production to meet the demand.  More people go to work, everyone is happy, except banks, who make less from low rates.  At least that is the theory.

The thing is, if you use that first dollar of borrowing to, say, build a house, you have increased the amount of assets in the world by converting labor into stuff.  You could in theory do it with store credit, if Home Depot let you borrow their stuff (lumber, nails, etc.) with a promise to pay them back later, but banks remove the need to negotiate advances from all your suppliers.  So I don't see loans as bad if the funds are used productively.  If they are used for consumable items that leave you nothing in the end, then not so good.
At the Federal government level, money spent on infrastructure (like roads and airports) is useful and increases value.  While money spent on the military tends to be "consumable" stuff (like bombs).  If they borrow to pay for the latter, that is not useful.

I assume courthouse records are a closed system among the 4000 counties in the US.  Only they would have key pairs with which to sign new records into the system, a record being the equivalent to a transaction in bitcoin.  Their public keys would be known to each other (4000 is a short list in computer terms), so outside people can't post transactions or solve blocks.
Excessive hash power would be noticed, because the valid list of keys to sign blocks is limited, and it would be obvious who is solving too many blocks.  "Signing blocks" is with the first record in the block being a message saying which courthouse found the hash.  It substitutes for the "coinbase" transaction in bitcoin, where the first transaction in the block claims the block reward.  Both need a digital signature.
I'll say it again, because the focus on bitcoin has made it unclear to a lot of people:

Thank you for getting this right, most people don't.  The US Dollar is convenient-sized units backed by debt.  The Federal Reserve issues paper money to banks in exchange for [collateral]( (section 2), which are essentially all debt securities.  The paper money is then distributed by ATMs and tellers for daily use.  
Banks multiply the money supply by making loans *without deducting the loan from depositor balances*.  The loan funds eventually end up in someone's account, increasing deposits, and the lender has a matching asset in the loan.  Thus the increased money supply is also backed by debt.

I know how in my own case.  I use a small credit union, and they flagged my first purchase similar to the original post here.  So I sent them a scan of my latest bank statement, which a scammer is unlikely to have.  It also has the credit union's contact information, if they needed to call and confirm anything.  That was enough info that they haven't given me a problem since.
More generally, I think if you give them enough confidence you are a real person and not a scammer, they will go ahead and approve you, but a variety of methods are probably acceptable.
A suggestion for them is to consider a small deposit for new customers, which would be released or returned after X successful transactions.  Another suggestion is a graduated spending limit, something Second Life has used for years to deter credit card fraud (their internal currency is convertible back to dollars).  You are limited to a small amount at first, and it goes up over time.  That allows people time to notice if their card number has been stolen and mis-used.

Yes, the puzzle self-adjusts every 2016 blocks (10 min = 144/day.  14 days = 2016 blocks nominally).  The software looks at the timestamps from the current adjustment block (a block whose number is an exact multiple of 2016), and the previous one.  The "difficulty" is adjusted by how much the actual time differs from the nominal time of 14 days.  In short, it is adjusted by how much the two-week average differs from 10 minutes per block.
The actual puzzle is "find a block hash (a kind of checksum) whose value is below a target determined by the difficulty".  The block hash includes the actual transactions in the block, the hash of the *previous* block, and a random number (nonce) that the miner varies to get a low hash value.  The difficulty formula and hash target are set so the *whole network* of miners find a good value once per 10 minutes.
The hash is calculated from the contents of the block, so if anyone tries to change the data (adding or changing a transaction), the hash will no longer match.  Since the hash is saved in the next block, you can't just change something in one block.  You have to update the next block too, and every one after it.  Otherwise, there will be a mismatch somewhere in the chain of blocks, and the software will notice.

My understanding of what makes a blockchain is that it has blocks secured by hashes, which are posted in the next block, thus linkiing the blocks in order in a chain.  If you change any data in a block, the hash no longer matches the one in the next block, breaking the chain.  That lets you detect any changes, and verify the integrity of the whole chain.
A consensus mechanism doesn't have to do all that.  You could agree that a transaction is good if it has sufficient independent signatures, who verify the sender had the funds to send.  If you limit consensus-making to trusted member banks, such a method can work.  Proof-of-work hashing was created for when you don't trust anyone in particular, but trust that at least half the network is honest because they are trying to win the block reward, rather than mucking about with individual transactions.

It's not to prevent freezing, it's because a heat pump moves heat from outside air to inside air.  At a low enough temperature the outside air lacks enough heat to move, so a supplemental heater is used to warm the inside air instead.
Ground source heat pumps get the heat to move from either pipes laid underground, or deep wells.  The thermal mass of the ground is big enough to carry a home through an entire season.

Money was invented to satisfy the "coincidence of wants" problem in barter.  In simple barter, I have to want what you have, and you have to want what I have, at the same time.  Money splits the transaction, so that I only have to find someone who has what I want, as long as everyone accepts money as an intermediate.
Computers and networks open the possibility of multi-party barter.  Rather than trying to match the wants of two people, you do it between many people.  The more people who are trading, the more likely you can find a given item you want, and other people have what you want.  When the quantities don't match, you get temporary barter credits, or a second item you find acceptable.  For example, I do woodworking, so I'll take lumber in trade to even up a deal.  Before computers it was hard to match up people's wants.  With computers, it's easier to have large trading communities and more complicated trade deals.

Clerk's offices would have a known list of public keys, since there are only ~4000 of them.  They would be the only ones able to sign the first record in a block.  Other records would be the contents of a deed or other document type they currently file.  Records substitute for transactions in the bitcoin block chain.  So instead of a block being a series of transactions, the first of which is the coinbase (the one that generates new coins, not the company), a block would be a series of records, the first one identifying which clerk's office found the hash.
You can add other signatures, for example from the parties to a property sale, but the primary signature on a record would be from the courthouse office.  A trustless system isn't a goal here.  Courthouse records are part of the court system.  That system is how boundary or ownership disputes get settled.  So long as people rely on that system, they inherently trust the recordkeeping function.  Using a block chain to make it more distributed and secure is a technical improvement.

I didn't say it was, and that wasn't my point.  I was giving an example of how banks got off easy, with relatively small fines, no jail terms, and even bail-outs.


Oh, you mean like Countrywide Financial (since bought by Bank of America) who made predatory and fraudulent mortgage loans?  They had a bank division too.  BoA inherited the problems and consequent fines.  They were not innocent victims.
The real problem was that *everyone* in the real estate industry caused the problem, from borrowers who lied about their income, to lenders who allowed such "liar loans", to appraisers, to credit ratings agencies.  You can even blame rising economies like China, who had massive savings rates, which impelled banks to find somewhere to lend all those trillions out.
Blame the Fed and other central banks if you want, they too are part of the problem, because they can't think of any other tool to use but lowering interest rates, even into negative territory.

My assumption is that the registry is public.  If you don't mind the world knowing what you registered, like real estate documents, you can leave it in plain-text.  If you want to keep it private, encrypt it.  When you want to prove to someone a contract existed on a given date, you can decrypt it for them, and point to the registry for the block time stamp.
A public registry increases security, because people outside the circle of notaries will keep copies when their own data is stored in it, and possibly add mining power.  Multiple copies make tampering easier to detect.  The job of the notary is what they do now: be a witness to the original signature and identity of the signer, then file away a copy for future reference.

tl;dr: Yes, but it has some drawbacks.
The banking system *already* has private funds transfer systems: clearinghouses and SWIFT.  But they are slow and outdated.  For example, US domestic clearinghouses can take up to three days to settle an ACH transfer (ACH means automated clearing house).  [SWIFT]( which is mostly for international transfers, takes 2-5 days if no special problems crop up.
A blockchain system works differently.  All the bitcoins in existence reside in the blockchain.  They never leave it, but merely change which address, and therefore which private key, can make the next transaction.  A change in ownership of bitcoins is immediately visible to everyone, and irreversible by mining in about an hour.  
That would be faster and cheaper not just for banks, but for their customers.  The downside to a private chain is less hashing power to keep it secure, and the possibility of reversals if the member banks agree to discard a transaction and redo the chain.  They can do that if they are the only ones mining.  Distributed mining makes reversals infeasible because no single entity has enough power to redo the chain faster than everyone else just keeps adding to it.

The denomination is irrelevant.  What matters is if the debt can be traded for other things of value (houses, food, etc.).  As long as you can do that, the debt itself has value, and is therefore not "nothing", it is "something"
Now, government debt can, and often has, gone down in value.  But then so have many other commodities.  And any kind of debtor can default, it's a risk.  But gold can be stolen and houses can burn down.  Any kind of asset has risks associated.


The Fed increases the money supply by "monetizing debt".  They buy Treasuries and the other kinds of debt, and pay for it by crediting the selling bank's account with them.  But there is a finite (though large) amount of such debt.  They can't monetize forever without accepting lower grade loans.  The financial markets will recognize the lower quality collateral behind the dollar, and value it accordingly on the foreign exchange market.
Sucking up all the outstanding Treasuries as currency backing also will increase the price on them, lowering yield, possibly below the inflation rate.  That would make it hard for the Federal Government to issue more debt.  So they can't really monetize *all* the debt, side effects put a limit on it.

Actually, what I am working on is distributed production, known as a "MakerNet".  That's where different people or small businesses have networked automation, such as 3D printers, machine tools, and robots.  The different steps in production can all be coordinated electronically, with the digital design files and escrowed payment in bitcoins going to different nodes in the network.  Funds get released from escrow as each task is completed.  This is in contrast to the model of production where ownership and the physical machinery are centralized.  Such a distributed network can grow up within existing metropolitan areas, and in parallel with existing businesses.  A current machine shop can start accepting MakerNet orders and bitcoin payments via a website, without changing any of their hardware.
Running away to an island or a remote village throws away access to customers, and requires you to build a complete economy all at once.  That is really hard to get right.  Growing a new system in parallel to the existing one lets you make mistakes and fall back to the original when needed, and gradually transition over.


That is changing faster than you might think:

Sorry, but nope.  An essential part of money laundering is disguising the origin of funds, which is not happening in this case.  Drug seizures of all kinds (boats, cars, real estate) make no attempt to hide where the assets come from.  The government just profits from it, and takes the proceeds for general use.
If the US government tried to sell these coins as "products of our NSA mining farm", *that* would be laundering them, trying to remove the taint of their coin seizure from lowering the sales price.  The fact they are selling the coins like any other seized asset shows there is nothing wrong with the coins in the first place.

This is a common misconception.  Dollars are almost entirely backed by debt.  The Federal Reserve buys Treasury Bonds and Agency mortgage securities, and credits member bank's accounts at the Fed with dollars as payment.  The banks then do fractional reserve lending.  Those loans appear as the borrower's cash or bank deposits somewhere in the system, matching the loan amount.
There are still precious metal coins in circulation, which are valid at face value if anyone is dumb enough to spend them that way, and the Fed holds gold certificates nominally backed by depository gold held by the Treasury (Fort Knox and other locations).  It's questionable if those certificates are redeemable for actual gold, but the certificates are on the Fed's books as an asset against circulating paper money.  Those exceptions are why I say dollars are "almost entirely" backed by debt.

This is too narrow a view of the technology.  Chained hashes with proof of work can secure *any kind of data whatsoever*.  It just happens that financial transactions are the first use.  But let's take the example of recording real estate paperwork at the county courthouse.  Today the records clerks file the paperwork in a vault or scan it into a computer for a fee.  But this is insecure, because it is stored in only one or a few places (and courthouses have burned down in the past, losing all the records).  It is also hard to search, often requiring a trip to the courthouse to trace the chain of ownership/mortgages/easments/liens.
A block chain of property records can solve these problems.  It would be distributed among all participating courthouses, so any one being lost isn't a problem.  It can also be distributed to all interested parties - insurance, bank, real estate agents, etc.  Courthouses would still collect fees to record the data onto the chain, and they would mine blocks to secure the data.  There doesn't need to be an internal currency token, because they get paid a different way.  It would also not be an open peer-to-peer system, only courthouse clerks offices would generate blocks.
A currency token and mining incentive is needed with an open peer-to-peer network, but not every block chain needs to be open in the sense that anyone can mine blocks.

The mint makes coins.  The Bureau of Printing and Engraving makes paper money.  And you [heard wrong](
Please note that the amount printed is not the same as the amount that goes into circulation.  Old paper money wears out and has to be replaced.  New paper money enters circulation based on bank demand, not how much is printed.
For currency in circulation, the [Federal Reserve]( shows the amount on the first line of Table 1 (continued).  It's an estimated number since they don't track old coins which have been destroyed or lost.  Paper money (Federal Reserve Notes) is tracked.

A block chain is a chain of data blocks, where each block is check-summed by a hard to find hash, and the hash is part of the data for the next block.  This is useful for securing any kind of data which gets added to constantly.  Bitcoin happens to use it for financial transactions, but you can use it to protect *any kind of data whatsoever* against corruption and tampering.
There is no necessity to use a block chain in a distributed way, or to use it for finance.  That just happened to be the first application.  I could use it to log my personal emails on my PC, and be able to tell if the hard drive messed up, or someone tried to plant a fake email to make me look like a criminal, simply by rehashing the chain.

Money solves the "coincidence of wants" problem in barter.  In simple barter, I may have wheat, and want a chair.  So I have to find someone else who wants my wheat and has a chair to trade.  This is hard to do.  It is much easier to find someone who just wants my wheat, and another person (like a woodworker) who just has a chair to trade.  In order to make those two simpler trades, I need to accept an intermediary product from the wheat buyer, and give it to the chair seller.
Whatever people use in this way as an intermediary in trade is what we call money.  To function as money, it should have certain properties, such as general acceptance (it's of no use if nobody will trade for it), durability (since the two trades may happen at different times), divisibility (since the amounts of the two trades may be different), etc.  Historically, many many things have been used as money, from giant stationary rocks to bitcoin, to "baby-sitting hours" in a personal example.  
That was a private form of money among parents in a baby-sitting co-op we had.  I'll watch your kids if you'll watch mine, with a spreadsheet to keep track.  Perfectly acceptable medium of exchange among our circle of parents.  I don't accept Chinese Yuan, since I have no use for them in the U.S., but money doesn't need universal acceptance to function as money.
Acceptance of US dollars is required by law for payment of taxes and discharge of debts.  Since people have to already accept them for certain things, they may as well accept them for everything, as that is simpler than multiple types of money.  Note that until the mid-1800's the Spanish silver dollar was the most common coin in the US, because the early US didn't have extensive silver mining, and the federal government was small, and thus didn't mint much of their own coin.  Spain had vast amounts of silver from their American possessions, and they were a trading partner, so we got some of their coins.  Until the Federal Reserve was founded a century ago, we also had a plethora of privately issued bank notes.  Multiple currencies were complicated, because they didn't always trade at face value.

You should not expect the price to have changed on halving day.  Back then, many people (including me) were mining on GPU cards.  The ones who were serious and ran multiple cards needed to sell some of the coins they made to pay the electric bill.  That typically comes due once a month.  So the reduced supply should have showed up on the market about a month after the halving, and the market price affected a little after that, as the order books on the exchanges depleted on the supply side.  Sure enough, about 5 weeks after the halving, the price went up dramatically.

Not all of the shares will, only the ones that have been held long enough to finish the 1 year "lock up" period.
The same rule applied to Facebook when it went public.  The original shareholders, like Zuckerberg, had to lock up their shares for a time, before they could sell them to the public on the open market.  The theory is this prevents scammers from pumping a stock and immediately selling it to suckers.  They have to hold it themselves for a while, and release financial reports.  The delay gives the public time to discover if the company is solid or a sham.
In theory, the delay also allows the SEC time to detect shenanigans, and they are actually good at picking up on some kinds of trading patterns (it's automated).  But their bureaucracy is so damned slow, other kinds of fraud can take several years to be detected.

Housing prices are set by supply and demand, but different people are in different markets.  If you have school-age children, you want more bedrooms, and good schools.  If you are near retirement like me and have a noisy hobby (woodworking), you might not care about schools, but want a full basement.
If the market isn't physically constrained, like Hawaii, San Francisco, and Manhattan (entirely or nearly surrounded by water), when prices get high enough, people will build new housing farther out, because that will be less expensive.  If you are constrained, people build up instead of out.  Either way, supply grows, but it's a slow response, because annual construction is a small percentage of total housing stock, and construction takes time.  So market imbalances can exist for years.
If you are trying to get into home ownership, it's worth learning about your local situation and trends, because real estate is local.  No two pieces of property are the same, and neither are any two cities.

That's not where the main value is in orbital mining, it's more of a side effect.  Platinum, for example, occurs at around 15 parts per million (ppm) in the right type of asteroid.  On Earth most of it sank to the core with the iron, so 15 ppm is a very rich platinum ore.  But bulk rock for shielding, oxygen and water for crew, propellants, carbon and iron for structures, etc. are present in the range of 20-100% by mass in the right asteroid types.
Since mass of any kind in low orbit costs $1600/kg today (more for higher orbits), we are talking $320-$1600/kg in ore value for the bulk products.  Platinum is $37,000/kg today x 15 ppm = $0.55/kg ore value.  It's pretty obvious which is more valuable.
In the near term, we can't refuel or repair most satellites in orbit (Hubble and the Space Station are exceptions).  So a communications satellite that costs $300 million to build and launch is a total write off if it breaks or runs out of fuel.  If we could service these satellites and put them back to work, that would be worth billions of dollars a year.
In the long term, the amount of energy that passes Earth closer than the Moon is equal to the world's fossil fuel reserves **every minute**.  What would that energy be worth if you could tap it?  Launching satellites to make use of that energy is too expensive.  However, raw materials already in space can be used for about 98% of the satellite mass.  The other 2% is scarce elements not found in space, or hard to make items like computer chips that don't weigh much.
We won't be building space power stations for decades, but they are inevitable.  Solar flux in orbit is 7 times higher than on the ground (no night, atmospheric absorption, or weather), and you can easily concentrate it with lightweight reflectors.
Another long-term value is real estate.  Mars has as much land area as the Earth.  You might say it is worthless desert, but then so were Las Vegas and Dubai before technology made them livable.  What's a whole planet worth to real estate developers?

No, you don't.  The "history of transactions" consists of the block chain, plus recently relayed transactions.
Network nodes (and miners are also nodes) maintain a "memory pool" of recent transactions that are not yet in a block.  The nodes check the digital signature of the transaction, and if the sending addresses had enough funds to send.  The memory pool includes time received, keeping transactions in order until put in a block.  When a new block arrives, the included transactions get removed from the memory pool, so it maintains roughly a constant size.
So funds can be sent in another transaction as soon as the network relays the previous one (typically ~10 seconds), but it then contains "unconfirmed inputs" until the previous transaction is in a block.  There is a small chance the previous transaction will never get in a block, stranding the later one.  If the previous transaction has no unconfirmed inputs and a proper fee, it is unlikely to never get in a block and you can reasonably safely spend it.  If you don't like taking chances, wait a bit.

It's not nitpicking to apply the standard definition that's been around for decades. To be laundering, there has to be an effort to hide the source of funds, which isn't happening in this sale.  Resale of seized goods is in the same category as surplus auctions.  Both are disposing of items the government doesn't need itself.  Some seized goods aren't sold at all.  Vehicles and weapons are sometimes retained for internal use, for example.  Others are destroyed, such as packages of cocaine.

As an alternative to *owning* a widely connected node, you can look up the transaction on a widely connected site like blockchain.info.  That's how I check that Coinbase has sent funds to my cold wallet.  If it shows up on blockchain.info with a transaction fee, I'm reasonably confident it will eventually get confirmed (and I still check an hour or more later for 6 confirmations).  Blockchain.info is connected to 1450 nodes, which is a significant fraction of the network.  If they have seen it, it is likely everyone else will within a few seconds.

Nope.  I can value my bitcoins in terms of how many machine tools I can buy with it, without ever involving another currency.  I can also value it as "how many millionths of the block chain do I control?" in terms of itself.
What many people miss about Bitcoin as a system is that there is only exactly 1.00000 block chains, ever.  Addresses, private keys, and wallets represent fractional control of the block chain.  Bitcoins as a unit, "Bits", and Satoshis are just convenient fractions of the block chain, so we don't have to deal with numbers like 0.000000046 block chains.

An independent check on a big supplier can save many small buyers from having to do it themselves.  
In some cases, like concrete construction, even if you are working in good faith, the ingredients (cement and sand/gravel) are variable, as is the mixing and placing.

Having a building not fall down is important enough that testing is required in every case.

A conservative approach is to increase it by as much as average bandwith, CPU, and hard disk capacity has increased since 2009.  The blockchain has been growing by 2.5 GB a month recently, and I have two copies for some reason (Core and Armory).  At my last hard drive purchase, that comes to $0.17 a month, which is quite sustainable.  
If storage starts to get painful for individuals, they can split the cost of dedicated nodes.  **This does not present an increased centralization risk**  If the block chain is growing that fast, then presumably there are more users.  If those users share the cost of a node, you end up with the same number we have now.

It's not the bitcoin network that is storing property records.  They have their own block chain designed for that purpose (much larger blocks of data per record, lower transaction rate).
County courthouses can and have been destroyed by fire, flood, and other disasters.  If each of the 4000 courthouses keep a copy of the shared block chain, that's at least 4000 copies. Other interested parties (lenders, real estate agencies, etc.) would likely want copies of their own, although they would not be able to enter new records, only copy them.  It is unlikely in the extreme that so many copies will all be destroyed.
If any single copy is destroyed for whatever reason (lets say terrorist blows up a courthouse), they can just download it again, check the integrity of the block data, and are back in business.
Please note that property records is just an example where you want secure data, though an important one because of the value of real estate.  There are other uses for secure data.

Me, I see [steady growth]( in user-to-user transactions.  Excluding popular addresses leaves out services like exchanges that are actually sending money between accounts of the same owner.
What you are positing is that Bloomberg L.P. and the New York Stock Exchange are morons for investing in bitcoin, and that none of the other $400 million in venture capital will create anything of lasting value.  Microsoft at least sees the value in programmable money. There is a scripting language for bitcoin transactions, and you can built other services on top of the base protocol.  I'd say they know something about programming.
Me personally, I see a use for coordinating distributed automation.  When you need something complicated to make, you can send out the design files *and* an escrowed transaction to the various suppliers.  As each one finishes their task or supplies their parts and materials, their part of the payment gets released, automatically.  They don't have to worry about collecting on invoices, because the funds are posted visibly *before* they start work.  The buyer doesn't have to worry about getting ripped off, because the funds are not released until the task is done.

As far as investments, you can hold your bitcoins as a store of value, or invest in something and earn more.

Equality of holdings is not an expected feature of any capitalist economy.  Assume everyone starts out with the same net worth.  Some people have higher valued skills, and get paid more.  A subset of these people will save part of their earnings.  Their net worth goes up.  Some people have low value skills, or spend more than they earn, their net worth goes down.
Some people have a good idea, or just work very hard to start a business, or are just lucky to get in at the right point.  These people can become rich relative to everyone else.  After a while, you end up with a wide range of net worth.
We didn't start with an equal distribution of net worth in reality.  So inheritance factors into the distribution, making it even more unequal.  If you want equal results, that's socialism, not capitalism.  Your problem is then with the overall economic system, not bitcoin in particular.

We aren't starting with chip fabs, that's like the end point of evolution.  We are starting with basics like lumber, cement, and metal casting, then moving to electrical and chemical items.  Electronics is late on the list because you can buy them cheap, and they are hard to make.

We hope that other people will contribute or upgrade the designs in the same way people work on open source software.  Since hardware is more expensive to fiddle with than software, we propose a "MakerNet", where people have different machines and skills, and help each other make stuff, and encourage people to team up on local projects.

That had already happened by 2012 on the [Virtual World Exchange]( which was set up to trade fiat currencies with various virtual world ones.  You will note they list BTC, and I used them to buy my first batch of BTC for Second Life Linden Dollars (L$) back in late 2012.
The Linden Dollar had always been convertible on exchanges (it was allowed by the world's owner), and programmable via the internal scripting language.  That led to an explosion of applications, like vending machines to buy in-world items.  However, Second Life never allowed their currency to be used outside their world, probably because of the legal complications that would create for them.  It was obvious (to me at least) that a digital currency that could be used anywhere would be a winner.  So I traded some of my L$ for BTC right away, and have been buying more ever since.

Actually, new transactions are relayed immediately to other nodes on the network, and placed in the "memory pool".  When a block is found, the transactions in that block are removed from the memory pool, since they are now part of the block chain.
The block chain + memory pool represents the current state of all addresses.  If it were not for that, you could double-spend and not get caught until the next block.  The memory pool tells a node the address has been depleted, and therefore can't make another transaction.  That happens as fast as the node can check the transaction and add it to the pool, which is in seconds or less.

The point of a blockchain is to timestamp data entries so you know which came first, and to secure the contents with difficult to reverse chained hashes.  "Permissioned" isn't all or nothing.  For example, a network of banks may allow wire transfers among each other. Customers could sign transactions to initiate a transfer, but blocks may only be allowed to be generated by the banks themselves.  That keeps anyone else from generating spurious blocks with fake transactions.
That may not be a good example, but hopefully it gets across the idea that an internal network among banks, for funds transfer, may have different conditions for blocks vs transactions.  Another way to vary permissions is requiring all wire transfer type transactions to need two signatures, one from the customer, and another from a bank officer, with the latter from a "trusted list" of public keys.  A wire transfer is "real money" (as real as such things get in a fiat system), so a bank may not want just anyone to send it.
Bitcoin was designed to be digital cash, and cash doesn't need permission from anyone to travel person-to-person.  The technical setup of bitcoin reflects that.


I haven't seen such a question to her, but I can guess what the answer will be.  "The needs of my future customers are different than what bitcoin was designed for.  I'll happily steal the technical innovations in bitcoin, but use them a different way".  I can't really fault her if that's her position.  Bitcoin is open-source, so she doesn't need our permission to use it a different way.  I can't predict if her approach will work or fail miserably, only time will tell.  I do know the Canadian MintChip digital currency died after a few years.

SWIFT is a communications network that delivers transaction messages.  Banks maintain "correspondent accounts" with each other.  For example, Banco Bradesco in Brazil might have an account with JPMorgan Chase.  So when a SWIFT message arrives, Chase moves account balances between Banco Bradesco and their own account, or a customer's account.
Not having to have correspondent accounts with each other and sending funds directly would simplify and speed up things.  Right now if a Brazilian customer needs to send funds to a Chase customer, their bank first has to fund their account with Chase, then Chase has to move the funds from one of their accounts to another.
I'm not sure of the current topology of SWIFT, but in the past, not every bank had a correspondent account with every other bank.  Typically the smaller banks had an account with a larger "money center" bank (i.e. New York, London, etc).  The money center banks then all had accounts with each other.  That made international payments more complicated and slower.  Electronic messaging, like SWIFT, can certainly go from any bank to any other bank.  But the actual funds transfer from one account to another wasn't so simple.

The financial crisis was caused by fraud and greed, not theft.  The fraud happened at several levels.  The first was fraudulent mortgage applications, known as "liar loans". Borrowers, with the help of the mortgage companies, lied about their income.  With the help of appraisers, they lied about the value of the property.  They then packaged these crappy loans and sold them to mortgage agencies like GNMA, or as market securities.
Further fraud happened by the securities ratings agencies, who rated bonds backed by these crappy loans as AAA when they should have been C or lower.  Finally, some investment funds lied about how many of these bad loans they held, or what they were worth.  Sadly, I was an investor in such a fund, lost money, and got back 20% of the losses after 6 years of litigation.  So I'm painfully aware of the chain of events.
The greed was from unqualified home buyers buying in a rising market, hoping to flip the home for a profit before they could no longer make the payments.  It was also from lenders collecting loan fees from loans they knew would go bad, and ratings agencies getting higher fees from rating stuff they knew was crap.  The fraud was systemic, all through the process.
There wasn't any theft going on.  People willingly turned in the keys to their home to the lender, or let it go to foreclosure, if they couldn't pay any more.  Lots of people lost money, either because their property values went back down, or they invested in bonds that later imploded.  Lots of other people lost their jobs.  But none of those are theft.

Anarchy is a strawman argument.  Most people, myself included, agree on a common set of basic crimes, like murder and theft, and are willing to organize to deal with the occasional lawbreaker.  In the past, it was too complicated for everyone to have a custom legal system.  With computers it is not too complicated to have legal systems by "subscription".  You choose what laws you want to be covered by, and pay a proportionate fee.  The rule of reciprocity says if you want to be protected against theft, for example, you can't steal, otherwise you must accept the punishment you agree to with your subscription.  
People can choose no subscription, and roll their own protection.  But in that case, they would be known "outlaws" (outside the law).  They are free to commit crimes, but they have no protection against retribution either.  Most people will likely choose a standard package of legal protection, for the same reason they put locks on their doors and install home security systems.
What we have today is a system where you have no choice about what laws you are under in a given location, and how much you have to pay in taxes, including the part that covers law enforcement and courts.
Anarchy also doesn't solve the problem of who owns what.  We do that today with property records and vehicle titles.  Without some kind of public record-keeping, buying, selling, and financing becomes difficult.  A block chain system can in theory replace courthouses for keeping such records, but some such system is needed so that people can agree who owns what, and a method to settle disputes when they arise.

Comparing the Silk Road indictment to the block chain over the same period shows that only 4% of bitcoin transactions were spent on that market.  Other online marketplaces were negligible at the time.  And the prosecutor had every reason to maximize the amount reported.


At the present time, I would agree with that assessment.  I therefore don't put all my savings into bitcoin.  What I invest is based on the large amount of venture capital and software development going on in that space, and the chance bitcoin might grow out of being a speculative asset.  I'm doing my part, by working on the "MakerNet" - networked distributed fabrication, using escrowed bitcoin as the payment mechanism between users.


There is no single moment in time when that happens.  The indicators I look at are "money supply" (coins in circulation x price in dollars), annual fluctuation against other major currencies, and merchant adoption.
When bitcoin has an  M1 money supply in the top third of world currencies (= New Zealand, $27 billion), fluctuations less than twice that of the average fiat currency, and over a million merchants accepting it, I would say it is past the start-up stage, and "established".  But those are not "one day its not, and the next day it is" kind of lines.  It's more like a fuzzy zone around those targets where it transitions.

Well, from personal experience, they will lift a finger, but not much more.  Regions Bank had a brokerage division, Morgan-Keegan, which ran various mutual funds.  I invested in one of them, unfortunately.  The funds invested heavily in mortgage-backed securities, didn't properly tell investors, lied about the value of the securities, and lost about $1.3 billion.  The bank ended up paying 20% of the losses in settlements, without admitting guilt.  One guy, the fund manager who altered the value of the securities, paid a $400K personal fine and was barred from the securities industry.  Nobody went to jail.
Other banks have paid fines and settlements, some much larger than Regions did, but generally they paid a lot less than the losses they caused, and nobody has gone to jail over it.

Calling them all theft is like calling everything you sit on a chair, even if it's a couch, or a recliner, or a plastic crate.  Language is a wonderful tool.  Don't treat it like a blunt instrument, use the shades of meaning you are provided with precision.

You don't store the actual data on the blockchain.  You store a hash of the data once the original data is verified (say by a notary public you visit in person).  When people need to see the data, you send it, and refer to the blockchain to validate it.  They don't keep the data, so no big database to hack.  They can keep the reference to the block chain entry as a user ID if they need one.

If you are going to do optical relay, you basically focus telescopes from one tower to the next, and send the signals through them, instead of an optical fiber on the ground.  For that to work, you need a stable base for the telescopes.  You also need a way to get the data signal from the top of the tower to the bottom, and on to the rest of the network.  Running a fiber optic cable vertically is pretty easy.
I'm not convinced a balloon is stable enough for the telescopes, or has enough lift to support 10 km of fiber optic cable.  I could be convinced if someone had the data, but for now I'm not.

Anything that allows the right to profit from the work of others is a "security", and the SEC will seek to regulate it.  Doesn't matter what you call it.
Let's take an apartment complex.  You kick in 10% of the purchase, along with 9 other people, and you actively work to run the place, that's a partnership,  You kick in 10% and someone else runs it, you don't work, but are entitled to a share of the profits, that's a security.  If it is a small enough number of investors or dollar amount, it may be exempt from registration, but it is still a security.  And in the US we have state securities laws.  Even if exempt under SEC rules, you may have to register with your state.
Please note: just because I'm explaining these rules does not mean I'm in favor of them.  But if you break them you should be prepared for a government official chasing after you.

Linden Research Inc. also has a convertible frictionless currency in their Second Life virtual world, since the mid-2000s.  Despite being based in San Francisco, and having investors like Ebay founder Pierre Omidyar, they never got the idea to expand their currency beyond their walled garden world.
Convertible - can be bought and sold for dollars and other currencies on approved exchanges.  People can run businesses in Second Life, and cash out their profits.
Frictionless - no transaction fees for the Linden Dollar (L$) between users (there is a fee to exchange for other currencies)
Programmable - Second Life has a scripting language (LSL), which includes functions for handling money.  Thus you can pay rent for game land, or have vending machines for game items.
Centralized - Issued and consumed by the operators of Second Life.  Can be arbitrarily siezed and transactions reversed for any reason, though usually for breaking the rules of the world.
Not so anonymous - Transactions are tied to avatar accounts, which in turn can be tied to credit cards or PayPal.  If you run a big enough business, you also get IRS tax forms.

The same way they police other tax collection: not very effectively.  An estimated 20% of the US economy is "underground".  That's made up of the "black market", which is illegal and unreported, like drugs and prostitution, plus the "off the books" sector, which is anything from lawn maintenance to home repairs done for cash, and not reported.  There's a vast number of other examples.
The IRS has 90,000 employees total.  Most of them are busy processing the 130 million or so legitimate returns.  The remainder simply don't have time to chase down everyone.  They chase funny looking amounts on returns, and they chase obvious tax cheats when they notice.  If you buy a coffee, and the coffee shop only has a bitcoin address, they can't report you, they don't know who you are.  If you hire an employee, pay in BTC, and they report their income on a tax return, the IRS has their hands on a piece of data that can be tracked to you.  They might ask where those BTC came from.  It's then up to you if you kept enough records and properly reported capital gains, if you had any.

Aircraft have a figure of merit called the "lift to drag ratio", or L/D.  To maintain flight, they have to produce lift equal to their weight.  The forces produced by airfoils have a backward component (drag) and a vertical component (lift).  The rest of the aircraft mostly generates drag.  To maintain speed, thrust must equal drag, and therefore must also equal D/L times the weight of the airplane.
Automobiles and locomotives don't have to produce aerodynamic lift to support themselves.  They do that through their wheels.  So the drag force that matters is "body drag" from the shape of the vehicle, not the additional drag produced by the wings.

Supply and demand caused the drop in prices.  Fracking increased supply.  OPEC countries increased supply even more to try and force fracking out of the market by going below their cost of production.  Fracking companies are working hard to reduce their costs (hey, even more technology).  But if it hadn't been for fracking, the OPEC countries would have been happy to keep prices at $100/barrel.


Um, in order to hydraulically fracture the oil and gas formations, you must first drill a hole.  Then you pump in the special mix of fracking fluids and sand at high pressure.  Finally you pump out the desired fossil fuels.  The only difference from conventional drilling is the extra fracturing step.

The incentive doesn't have to be internal to the block chain.  You can run a registry service that performs a function similar to Notary Publics.  Plaintext or encrypted data is added to a block chain, timestamped by the block, and a fee collected separately from the chain.  So an author, songwriter, or inventor can prove the creation date, because sufficiently buried blocks in a long chain are very difficult to edit.
If a number of people are members of the registry, collecting fees at local offices, and collectively mining blocks in a distributed way, there is still no need for an internal incentive.  They are being paid to maintain a secure data registry, and the block chain is merely how it is made secure.
There may be more efficient ways to make a provably unchangeable data registry, but I'm not enough of a computer scientist to know what those might be.  I just know that old blocks in a block chain are pretty darn hard to change.

Part of my job was to think up [new ideas](  Very few of those ideas ever make it past the Director and Vice President level to Corporate.  
Part of the reason is that there are very few people at the corporate level.  They simply don't have the time to review and understand everything going on at lower levels.  That's why the traditional corporate pyramid organization is "stupider" than start-ups.  Levels of management below them have to filter stuff out for simple time reasons, and so lots of good ideas get neglected.

The US dollar is a terrible long-term store of value.  It has fallen by a factor of 24 between 1913 and 2015, an average loss of 3.2% per year.  As a short-term medium of exchange it is fine, but if you want to hold or build assets for the long term, you need something else.
My previous point was not to say that bitcoin is better, it was to say the same incorrect arguments used against bitcoin apply to dollars, or fiat currencies in general.  The "intrinsic value" argument is fallacious.  Everyone assigns different values to things, and the same person assigns different values to the same thing at different times.  If we all assigned the same value to things, trade would cease because there would be no gain from it.
Concentrating on the value of a bitcoin in trade is wrong.  The Bitcoin Network is where the value comes from.  That includes nodes, miners, software, apps, merchants, and users.  Without all those, bitcoins are just entries in an accounting ledger (the block chain), which has no value of itself if it can't be used for trade.  The value of a bitcoin unit in the ledger is subject to daily supply and demand forces.  The Network is growing and improving all the time, that has not shrunk by 2/3.

That's more a consequence of the industrial revolution taking hold in the US fairly early (along with Europe), and the U.S.'s large population.  China is going to take over first place in a decade or two.  They have four times the population of the US, and their GDP is growing faster.


You are cherry-picking your time periods.  Bitcoin went from $17/BTC on 16Jun2011 (when I started mining), and just after the peak of the first large price bubble, to $240/BTC at the moment.  That's 14 times higher in 3.7 years, or a 104% compound growth rate.  
It admittedly was quite variable in that period, ranging from about 3 to 1000.  So I would not class bitcoin as a stable, long term store of value yet.  It hasn't been around long enough to have a long-term history.  It currently, in price terms, acts like a speculative start-up, or a mining/petroleum play.  Those can return huge gains if you are lucky, or yield zero if you are not.

If you are a top wealth-holder, and not an idiot, your wealth will increase simply because you don't have to spend all your income on living expenses.  You can devote more to investments and let them grow.
And the Fed has [slowed asset purchases]( for the moment.  It is not like they hand out cash to rich people.  What they do is buy Treasuries and Mortgage-Backed Agency Debt.  By increasing demand, the price of these securities goes up, which is equivalent to interest rates going down.  Rich people benefit from low interest rates if they use them for investments that return more than the cost of money.
The Fed is able to buy all these debt securities because they have no reserve requirement and unlimited leverage.  [Right now]( they are leveraged 78:1.  When they buy the debt, they simply credit the seller's account with the Fed.  The account balance is a liability to the Fed, but they now hold the debt security as an asset, so the books balance.

The Bitcoin Network has value because it is useful, just like the UPS and FedEx networks of trucks and distribution terminals are useful, or the Internet as a whole is useful.  All of these are made up of hardware, software, a network of users, etc.
Bitcoins (the tokens) represent fractional control of new transactions on the blockchain.  Since the only way to use the Network is by having some of the tokens, they derive their value from the Network's.  The more people who want and need to use the network, the more demand for the tokens.  Since there are a finite number of tokens, their value will go up with demand.
Things don't need backing if they are useful in some way.  Take a 2x4 piece of lumber.  It has value in itself, without any other backing.  But a 2x4 doesn't have properties that make it a good form of money.  Bitcoins (the tokens) are a tradable commodity first, like 2x4s, but they also have properties that make them good as money: easily determined value, easy to transport, durability, hard to counterfeit, divisible.
For a commodity to rise to be a currency it must also be commonly used as a substitute for barter in trade (medium of exchange), hold value over time, and as a unit of account.  That doesn't happen overnight.  Bitcoin is used as a currency by a small community at present.  If it demonstrates good properties over time, it can be adopted by more people, and become a full currency.

Not likely at this point.  "Mining farms" have been built that buy custom chips (ASICs) in bulk, and use cheap labor and cheap electricity to run them.  That's hard to compete against.


Not since about 3-4 years ago for bitcoin.  The possibility exists for "altcoins" - alternate cryptocurrencies that use different mining formulas and don't have as many people doing the mining.  You likely need a gaming laptop.  Graphics cards have many more cores that can run in parallel, compared to CPU chips.  If you mine an altcoin, there are exchanges where you can sell them for bitcoin or national currencies.  You should read up a lot more on the subject and figure out the possibility for profit before putting any money in.  Mining is a rapidly shifting business, like a gold rush was in the past.  Once everyone is doing it, the chances for profit go way down.

The Internet, if you tried to buy the whole thing.  Bandwidth and hardware components have got cheaper, but the aggregate value of the network has gone vastly up.  Focusing on the price of a bitcoin is like focusing on the price of UPS labels.  The label is just a token.  The real value in UPS is the network of trucks, shipping terminals, and local agents.  Without those, the labels would be worthless sticky paper.  The Bitcoin Network is similar.  It moves money instead of packages, but the value is in the network that makes it possible, not the token.
As the network grows, software is improved, etc. the total value of the network can go up.  The utility, in the economic sense, of bitcoins also goes up, thus also their value.

"ACH" stands for "Automated Clearing House".  The reason it takes 2-3 business days is the "unautomated clearing house" still exists to handle paper checks, and they are still on a daily clearing cycle.
Clearing is how banks settle with each other for the payments due between them.  A paper check is an "order" to pay money, it is not actual money changing hands.  The actual transfer of funds happens at the clearing houses, most of which are Federal Reserve District banks.
Banks total up all the incoming and outgoing payments for the day, and calculate a net amount going in or out.  The clearinghouse opens a special account for the day, and the banks sending more outgoing, send their net to that special account (using wire transfer or other secure system).  The clearing house then wires all the banks who are owed incoming amounts out of that account.  Theoretically this "clears" the account - it ends up with zero balance.  In practice there are some glitches to iron out manually.  Once the account is zeroed, it gets closed.  Then they open a new account the next day.
The reason banks do it this way, is otherwise every bank would have to pay every other bank directly, for 9000 transfers per bank.  With a clearing house, each bank only does one outgoing or incoming transaction a day.
Once everything is electronic, they could speed up the clearing cycle to hourly or faster, or eliminate it entirely (9000 direct transactions is not too much for computers to handle).

Trading favors, such as social grooming in primates, predates the human species.  People still trade favors, such as when neighbors help each other.  The "currency" here is a mental reckoning of past favors given and received.  When I had young children, we were part of a baby-sitting co-op with other parents.  This formalized the favor trading (watching each other's kids) by tracking hours on a spreadsheet.  From there, it's a small step to a currency by making the hours tradable to third parties using slips of paper.

By comparison, NTT in Japan demonstrated 1 petabit/sec (1000 terabits/sec) in a single fiber, and fiber cables can contain up to 1000 fibers.  So the total capacity for a cross-country backbone can be immense.
The cost for fiber cables is not so much the cable itself, as the digging a trench the entire length to place the cable, and preferably a protective conduit.  If sufficiently tall towers were built, you could do free-space relays above the weather and avoid the cost of laying cable, at the expense of building towers.  Transmission speed would be at the speed of light, rather than 60-70% of the speed of light in a fiber.  Nobody has built a tower tall enough yet, but the materials to do so do exist.

Quite serious.  I was part of a team at Boeing that studied "mega towers".  Boeing actually has a lot of experience with structures that operate 10 km above the ground.  I also invented the idea of putting pivoting airfoils on the structure to reduce wind loads by about a factor of 20.  Winds are actually the biggest force on very tall structures.
These are not solid buildings, but open trusses like [TV or Radio masts](  You only need one per metropolitan area.
We considered how to build them, and construction workers at 30,000 ft doesn't make a lot of sense.  So instead we would build them from the "top down".  You assemble a vertical section, jack it up, then assemble the next section underneath it.  Repeat as many times as necessary.  Your crew stays more or less at ground level.
Carbon fiber/epoxy, like the stuff Boeing makes airplanes out of these days, has a safe working load of 800 MPa, and a density of 1600 kg/m^3.  Therefore an untapered vertical column can safely support it's own weight a bit more than 50 km high.  We are only going up about 10 km, to get above the clouds, and most towers like this are tapered, which puts less stress on the bottom.  So we are nowhere near the limits of material strength.  It's just nobody has had enough reason to build so high.
Besides data relay, you can also use it for broadcast, as a substitute for satellite TV, weather station, skydiving, tourist attraction, etc.  There are multiple ways to make money off of such a structure.
A tower this big needs a wide base, at least 500 meters across.  So you would not put it in a city center, but rather on the outskirts.  Since it is mostly empty space, it will not block the Sun, so you can still grow trees or crops under it.  The tower footings (concrete base) only need to be where it reaches the ground, at a few points.

There is just one record of bitcoin transactions, the "block chain" (where a block is a set of transactions secured by a checksum called a "hash").  Each transaction specifies an amount of bitcoin units being moved, and the source and destination addresses.  Since the coins can only be moved between addresses, they can't be copied.  
Several features of the Bitcoin software and network ensure everyone agrees on the record of past transactions in the block chain.  Since everyone agrees, they also agree to what balance each address has.  It is the simple sum of all the transactions moving coins in and out of the address.  Your private key allows you to sign a new transaction moving coins from the paired address for that key to some other address.
The "thing" you are seeking to define is address balances and transaction amounts.  We call 1.00000000 unit a bitcoin.  One millionth of a unit is called a "Bit", and 1/100th of a Bit is a Satoshi, which also is 0.00000001 unit, the smallest amount tracked in transactions.
You can copy the block chain all you want, it's public, and full copies of the software download and check it themselves.  But they all say the same thing, and there is a finite amount of bitcoins (balances) being tracked.

Please see the example of [Hosni Mubarak](
The cronies include family members, who set up a fake company.  The government hires a real contractor to build something, but under the table sub-contracts part of the work to the crony company.  The crony company may be chartered in a tax haven country, where the owner's name is protected.  They may even perform some useful services to make it look legitimate.  But a large amount of money is siphoned off by overpaying for things.  You would have to dig deep into invoices and other company records to see where the funds are actually going.


Extended family usually get a big share of the money, and government underlings (department heads, etc) get a nice chunk.  As long as they play along, the money rolls in.  Typically the top guy controls the state security apparatus and military, which keeps the rest in line (and the general population too).  Despite their best efforts, dictators get overthrown on a regular basis.  Squirreling funds offshore is an insurance policy against that day.

You are probably thinking of the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, which does not say that.  The treaty is a product of the Cold War and the Moon Race, and says nations that signed the treaty can't claim entire celestial bodies, specifically including the Moon, which was about to be landed on by either the US or the USSR.
However, it also says that you retain ownership of your equipment, thus spacecraft, satellites, space stations, etc.  It prohibits weapons in space, but allows "peaceful uses", which would include mining and construction.

That's not necessarily true.  The halving reduces the daily new supply of coins.  We don't know what factors will change demand.  For example, if the block size stays at 1 MB, only so many people can use the bitcoin network per day.  More people beyond that creates a backlog of unconfirmed transactions, and therefore discourages use.  Price is determined by relative supply and demand, so if supply is certain, but demand is uncertain, the price will also be uncertain.

I was expanding on your comment, so thanks for being overly sensitive.  And no, they won't come looking for you (they never did for me) if you file the right form and indicate your business type is one that can have long periods between profits.  If your business is reselling yard sale junk on Ebay, the business type should be profitable right away or not at all.  It's not like real estate development, where it can take years before you get the zoning and permits to even start.
The IRS do not mindlessly chase after every taxpayer.  They have limited budget and staff, and therefore try to go after the the people they are most likely to collect additional taxes from.  For example, on my timber land, if for some reason I had listed entertainment expenses, that would be out of place, and they use software to flag such out of place entries.  It would make sense for them to question that item, which they would normally do with a letter.  I send them an explanation and a copy of my receipts, and they either accept it or not.
In reality I deducted interest on the land purchase, and relevant tools like a chainsaw (to maintain fire lanes).  I never got questioned because those fit for the kind of business I was in.  That's why they have all those line items on schedule C in the first place.  Otherwise you could just report total revenue, total expenses, and net profit.

That's why we established that one micro-bitcoin = 1 "Bit", and 0.01 Bits = 1 Satoshi.  A Satoshi is the smallest unit tracked on the block chain, with 100 million Satoshi = 1 full Bitcoin.
As the price goes up, people will naturally gravitate to using the smaller units.  A bit is a little too small for day-to-day use at the moment, since it is ~4650 Bits = 1 U.S. dollar.

And my comment disagrees with that assessment.  Money laundering in general is obscuring the source of income (generally illegal) to make it look legitimate.  In the case of the Silk Road coins, the government isn't trying to hide where they came from.  We all know where they came from, down to the bitcoin addresses.  So it is not money laundering, because the coins are not any "cleaner" at the end of the process.

The three days is a legacy holdover from the way banks cleared checks in the days of paper.  In the US, banks belong to clearinghouses, mostly the 12 Federal Reserve district banks, but also a handful of private ones.  Checks are instructions to pay someone, but are not in themselves a transfer of funds.  During the day, incoming and outgoing checks are processed and added up.  At the end of the day, the clearing house opens a new account.  All the banks with more outgoing than incoming funds wire the net difference to this account.  Then the clearinghouse wires the right amounts to all the banks due a net of incoming funds.  After the account is zeroed out (cleared out, hence "clearing"), it is shut down.  Thus each bank makes or gets one wire transfer per day, instead of thousands to every other bank they owe or are owed funds to/from.  In the days before cheap computing and the Internet, this was easier.
Since there are multiple clearing houses, the clearinghouses themselves clear through the Fed amongst themselves, also once per day.  So money going to another bank with another clearing house could take a day to get to the local clearing house, another day at the main Fed clearing, then a third day at the destination clearing house.
The main reason the Automated Clearing House (ACH) hasn't sped all this up is not every little podunk bank was ready to go electronic.  People still write paper checks.  Even though many of them are converted to images when deposited, some are still handled physically.  When a high enough percentage of transactions are electronic, they can go to hourly clearing or whatever.  The remaining few paper items would then be treated as exceptions with a hold time relative to everything else.  Everything else would be treated like cash - available to be used almost immediately.
Trust isn't relevant.  US banks are all part of the same system, and they *must* trust each other according to the system's rules.  That includes how "non-sufficient funds" items get returned and other exceptions.

My 7.5 Mbps Uverse bandwidth is already 562 times the 0.0133 Mbps required for 1 MB blocks, so my bandwidth is effectively unlimited for Bitcoin's needs.  Once 1 Gbps Google fiber is built out across Atlanta, it will be even more unlimited.
But "unlimited" is a spurious argument.  I live in Atlanta, and we have excellent "airplane seat bandwidth" (100 million passengers/year from our airport).  Should Boeing size their airplanes for Zimbabwe, or the Australian Outback, where passenger traffic is much lower?  Of course not.  They size them for decent sized airports with decent amounts of traffic.  
The bitcoin equivalent for nodes is developed areas with decent internet, which my current service is more than enough, and coming gigabit services will be enormously more than enough.

Any transaction that is too small to reasonably process by conventional means.  For wire transfers, that means a few hundred dollars, because the typical bank wire fee is $35.

The local bitcoins buyer (say in the US) is a trusted middleman.  It makes no difference if the middleman is using dollars or bitcoins, if he's collecting small amounts from ISIS supporters, in order to pay for weapons and supplies, you have to trust the middlemen not to run off with the money or goods.  Supporters sending bitcoins directly to Vlad's Armory in eastern Ukraine is too noticeable.  That's the whole point of money laundering (which is what this activity is) - making it hard to trace the source and use of funds.  Direct use of the block chain works against that goal, because *every* transaction on the block chain is traceable, at least to a previous or later transaction.  If any identifying info leaks before or after, that is an entry point to trace the chain of identities in the rest of the transactions.

I know all about the "hobby loss" rules, since I used to own timber land.  If you don't show a profit in at least 2 of 5 years the *presumption* that you are running a business and can therefore deduct expenses changes to a presumption you are not in it for profit and thus cannot deduct expenses.
The presumption, however, can be overruled by the facts.  For example, if you operate in a business-like fashion by keeping records, hire the right kind of staff, and have a plan for reaching profitability.  In agriculture and some long-term development projects it can simply take more than 5 years to show a profit.  That was the case with my timber land.

There is nothing in the way aside from lack of a customer who really needs it.  A big company like Boeing studies a lot of ideas, a few of which get built.  What prompted the interest in mega-towers was NASA's interest in space elevators.  The math tells us that a tower coming up from the ground meeting a cable coming down from space is the lightest way to build such a thing.
When we figured out they were feasible, we looked at other uses for mega-towers, like communications relays, launch platforms for rockets, etc.  We can only go so far on internal funding, so where this, and most other ideas, stop is when we don't find a customer who wanted to continue R&amp;D.  Sometimes an idea will wait until the proper time.  For example, I worked on Shuttle-Derived heavy launchers back in the 1980's.

They should use second-layer services on smartphones, which many of them already have, or just regular dumb mobile phones, which everyone more or less has (4.6 billion mobile phone users, 5.5 billion world population over the age of 15).  Services like Mpesa let you trade phone service credits as money.  Since every working phone has a service account, there are no extra requirements than some software.  Bitcoin is fine as a backbone service to handle transfers beyond your phone provider's local area, and do it in bulk transactions.  So family working out of the country can remit funds using bitcoin in a larger amount, then user in home country can spend it in small amounts using their mobile device.

It's not a program, it's an accounting ledger that has the history of every transaction, and a network of nodes that verify and relay new transactions.  They each have a copy of the ledger (the block chain).  So when you try to make a new transaction, they check that your digital signature is valid, and that you had enough coins to make the transaction.  If it passes, they relay it to other nodes.  If it is invalid for any reason, they don't pass it on.  Thus the consensus of the network is what decides if your transaction gets recorded.  There is no central main program, it is many copies of the bitcoin software, running on a P2P network with each other.  That is harder to hack than one central machine.

The problem with this argument is that higher numbers of transactions mean more users.  Therefore more people who can band together to pay for the larger servers, and the number of nodes stays the same.
An example would be a local restaurant, who accepts bitcoin.  They would be happy to pay a small monthly fee to access a node in a data center, so they know the payments they are getting are broadcast and confirmed.  You just want to make sure all the data center nodes are not owned by one company.  Instead, you want standard node software packages that can be spun up on any hosting provider, and have many people run them and collect fees from users to cover the cost.

So a modest increase in block size won't stress things for years.  I mean people run nodes on Raspberry Pi's, we are a long way from needing big servers.

A government per se is not the problem, if it is limited.  But every past civilization has ended because the rich and powerful got *too* rich and powerful.  Human nature is to want security and more stuff for yourself, your family, friends, and "tribe" (however you define that extended group).  Therefore the rich and powerful, being human, tend to increase their wealth and power by any means necessary, legal and illegal.
A current example in the U.S. is the gutting of the inheritance and income tax rates, coupled with the massive increase in corporate executive compensation.  Executives are raking in and keeping massive amounts, at the expense of employees and customers *regardless of whether they do a good or bad job at the company*.
"Rich and powerful" here means a single class which has most of the wealth and makes the laws.  It is not two separate groups with opposed interests.  Pyramidal organizations and monopolies are tools of the rich and powerful when they place themselves at the top.  So one way to keep this group from taking everything is to dismantle their tools.

Something else that may factor into miner's thinking was the reward halving that happened on July 9th.  Nobody was sure what would happen at that point, so they may have been cautious about changing clients at the same time.  The halving seems to have been mostly a non-event, with hash power only slightly dropping so far.  So with the bitcoin network running normally, they may feel more confident in making client changes.

Third world countries are irrelevant.  1 MB blocks limit you to about 10 million transactions a month.  So 10 million users making 1 transaction a month each on average.  That limits bitcoin to a small fraction of the world's online population, and the ones with fast enough bandwidth can easily saturate the network.

Reading the bot documentation (  ) it appears it *does* access the main block chain for every transaction, so I was wrong.  Let me give another example instead:
A local credit union runs a bitcoin denominated network among it's members.  Any transactions from member to member is kept within the network.  Transactions going outside the network are grouped by the credit union into larger transactions with one input (from the credit union) and multiple outputs (all the payees).  This will have a larger fee, and so get included in the block chain.
You do have to trust the credit union to not screw over the account holders, but you do that anyway today.  They can run a public block chain of their own to verify their internal records for their members, which would be an improvement over just trusting the back office - the current state of affairs for banks.

Look, I've owned a shipping container, I used it for storage at my last house.  I don't have a truck to haul it from the the container dealer, but he does.  It was going to take a couple of days to schedule the delivery.  I wrote a check after inspecting the container, and left.
30 minutes for the transaction to be confirmed is still shorter than the time for my check to be deposited and clear, and makes no difference in the delivery time.  And that's for a no-fee transaction.  I could have added the ten cents (0.1 mBTC) for a faster confirmation, and that still would have been less than I paid for check printing on the check.
It's kind of dumb driving around with a tilt-bed truck when you are shopping for a container, even if you owned such a truck - the fuel would be pretty high.  And very few people own such a truck.  So the case of wanting to drive off with the container just doesn't come up in real life.
In the more general case, when the product delivery time is &gt; confirmation time, waiting for confirmation is not an issue.  If the confirmation doesn't show up, they don't deliver the product.

It's centralized, but transactions are zero cost as long as they stay within the L$ system. There are fees to convert to or from dollars, so as long as the fees are enough to pay for the servers, it could be expanded as much as they wanted by adding more servers.
If they needed to expand the "money supply" they could simply sell more L$ on the market, something they used to do when that world was growing.
They put their own limit on expansion by not allowing it to be used for real-world goods and services.  Despite that, some people still used it that way.  For example, people would offer books for sale with payment in L$ and physical delivery afterwards.  The central market for Second Life items, however, is owned by the company that runs it, and they don't allow other stuff to be listed there.

I cannot predict future velocity change better than anyone else.  So I made the assumption that the current velocity will hold in the future.

I am unclear how money laundering harms the financial system.  HSBC and similar large banks seem to do a good business laundering funds for their clients, and the post-laundered money usually ends up buying stuff or invested, improving the economy.  $100 bills circulating outside the country do not contribute to the US financial system.
My guess, as a Treasury official, what she really means is "protect our ability to collect taxes".  They want to tax the underground economy like they want to tax everything else, which means having a data trail they can follow to individuals and businesses.  But we cannot expect government officials to be forthright when the topic is the source of their paycheck.

I consider the run up the last few weeks as "trading noise" - a new group of people found bitcoin, and demand temporarily exceeded supply, running up the price.  What I look at is the *lows* after a run up.  That represents the base demand in quiet times, after the short-term speculators have given up.  As you can see, the lows get higher each time:
That comes from increasing demand for bitcoin as a currency to spend, and not from speculators looking for a short term profit.

What you would look for is not just a balance, but a history of transactions matching the kind of items they purport to sell on their website (1, 5, 10 bitcoins).  Anyone can buy a few coins, but having a balance of hundreds, and a transaction flow of many coins a day which is not just circular flow of the same coins in and out is more expensive to fake.  Having a complete audit trail of every bitcoin transaction ever made makes detecting fraud easier. Only one person has to do the analysis to show the transactions are circular or otherwise faked, and you are busted.
You also have to consider how a business selling below market rate can possibly refill their bitcoin supply.  The only way that makes economic sense is these were stolen coins in the first place, and you are getting a bargain for that reason.  Anything else just does not make sense as a business.

Do the trade in front of a neutral third party.  A bank notary is a good candidate. 
Write up a bill of sale, with blanks for number of bitcoins and fiat currency amount, and a transaction number.  Come to an agreement with BTC seller on terms, then sign the bill of sale.  Show them the cash.  They send coins, and you fill in transaction number. Wait for confirmations before handing over cash.
What this does is give them an enforceable contract once they send the coins, and you are obligated to pay.

I figure that in about 20 years, 99% of all bitcoins will be issued.  The remaining 1% that dribbles out after that isn't going to make much difference.
How I calculate it:
* There are 9.75 million coins left to issue.  In theory, every 4 years that number falls in half, thus in 20 years we would expect ~300,000 coins left.  In reality, the first halving took 3 years 10 months, because of rising hash rates.  In that case, in 20 years we would have 5.217 halvings, and thus 262,000 coins left.  Those are 1.43 and 1.25% of all coins un-issued, and within another year or two the remainder will hit 1%.
Thus I would say "99% by 2035", and the rest is small enough to ignore.

A lending business needs a difference between what it takes in from loans and what it pays to funding sources.  This is analogous to the difference between sales and cost of production for a manufacturing business.  If both loan rates and funding rates are expressed as annual interest rates, the difference between them is the "interest rate margin".  So if Captial One charges 13% on it's credit card balances, and obtains the money to lend on those cards at 3% (which is actually what their corporate bonds average), their interest rate margin is 10%.  Capital One has overhead costs in running their card operation, and some borrowers default, then they have to pay taxes.  What's left after all that is their profit.
Interest rate margins explain why depositor rates can be negative, while loan rates are positive.  There's a middleman whose operating costs and profits create a gap between them.

You still need trade to take care of more specialized items, and for services that don't come out of a factory, so a bitcoin type system will still have a use in that kind of future.  But money isn't the only thing people need to live, and my skills are best used in that area.

I don't think they are really crooks.  My guess is Mt.Gox getting their US accounts closed sent a flood of new customers their way, and with the requirements for KYC/AML ID processing, and getting registered as a money transfer business in multiple states, they are just overwhelmed.
Whatever paperwork/deposit system they have just isn't working well enough.

When I got no timely response to the help desk ticket, I searched for a way to call them directly, and ended up finding their "office" isn't really their office.

My approach is to look at the transaction volume in dollars, and assume the average holding time and number of coins in circulation doesn't change much.  Thus if transaction volume goes up, then so must price.
The number of coins available for transactions per day is equal to total coins in circulation / holding time in days.  Thus if there are 12M total coins, and the holding time is 24 days, that means 0.5 million/day are available.  Total transactions in dollars per day divided by available coins equals the market price.
It's not strict 1:1 relationship, since exchanges can fluctuate, and supply can vary randomly on a daily basis.  But over a longer time period the relationship should hold.

The density of pure gold is 19.3 g/cc.  The only elements that are denser are silver colored and hard.  With a reasonably accurate scale and a ruler, and a few calculations, you can determine the density.  If it's the right density, yellow, and soft, it's very likely gold.  Popular gold coins allow you to skip the calculations, or refer to images and dimensions to verify they look right.

They do not have to be autonomous, in fact the first prototype "Seed Factory" equipment I plan to build will use a conventional workshop + some automated devices like CNC machine tools, 3D printers, and robotic vehicles.  Over time you would like to increase the automation level, but certain tasks would be too difficult to automate, or done so rarely it is not worth the bother, and those would continue to be done manually.
Replication is only one way to expand things.  The other two main ways are "Diversification" - adding new machines that are not in your starter set, and "Scaling" - building bigger versions than you start with.  The idea is "starter kit + design files for other machines" is smaller than "full size replicating factory".  When you are starting up, small is good.

As much as is profitable to mine, plus some amount for unprofitable mining for other reasons.
Since the current coin generation rate is ~ 3600 coins per day, and the market rate is about $ 30 US, then the most that mining can generate is $108,000 a day.  Miners looking to make money therefore will not spend more than that amount of energy doing it.
Some miners can exploit free power and not pay the true cost, but on a large scale you can't get that much free energy.
In the future, mining rewards will go down, and transaction fees may go up, but transaction fees will never be a very large fraction of the transaction value.  Let us assume the world replaces their entire $33 trillion in money supply with bitcoin, and the whole world's GDP ($67 trillion) was spent in bitcoin, and that 1% of each transaction is a fee.  Then 1% of the world's GDP would go to transaction fees, and miners would spend no more than that amount in energy to mine.
In practice, the current design of the bitcoin network does not scale to that level of transaction volume.  There are limits on the size of blocks that can be processed.  So bitcoin transactions would favor large ones, because their offered fees would be larger.  You might use bitcoin to pay for a house, but not a sandwich.  This would force smaller transactions to use subsidiary methods, and bitcoin reserved for large settlements between pools.  In that case, a vanishingly small amount of energy would be required for mining.

I find it interesting that a math-based currency, like Bitcoin, is used by lots of gamblers, who don't understand math.
When the house has a statistical margin, and you make enough bets, your average result will get worse and worse.  The only rational time to gamble is when your have a positive "expectation", i.e. the odds are in your favor.  This happens when you run the casino.  It also happens occasionally with US state lotteries that roll over prizes if they are not won.  Even though the expectation is negative on any given week, the roll-over of past weeks can make it positive.  Investments in general also have positive expectations, although any given investment may be a gamble over the short term.

The actual shares of stock (certificates, or the books where they are registered) are now mostly held by central clearing houses like DTCC (  That saves brokers from ever moving them when customers buy and sell.
DTCC holds the shares in bulk, and is the sole registered owner of those shares.  Brokerages have a proportionate interest in that bulk pile of shares, and in turn their customers have an proportionate interest in their broker's interest.  When you "buy" and "sell" shares on the major stock exchanges, what really happens is some numbers change at your broker and the DTCC databases, but the shares themselves stay where they are.
Thus the only way to do what you ask is to have an existing broker take deposits of bitcoin, and convert them to dollars. That's because they have to deliver dollars to the other broker they are getting the shares from.  It would just be another way to send them funds, along with paper checks, ACH transfers, and bank wires.

Governments function by having a monopoly on force, ie by having guns.  If you don't pay your taxes, eventually someone with a gun shows up to force you to pay or take your stuff.  If you break a law, someone with a gun will similarly show up to force you to obey or to punish you.
Bitcoin, and the Internet it runs on, function by means of clever applications of math.  No matter how many guns you show up with, you cannot change mathematics, thus government use of force is futile in this context.
The quote is a metaphor for government attempts to regulate that which cannot be regulated.  In the context of bitcoin, perhaps "hash value" would be better than "prime number" for accuracy's sake, but the public is likely to be more familiar with prime numbers.  As a metaphor I think it is fine to get the point across.

Well, that is also true if you hand cash to a random stranger on the street.  But if you make a contract and have the seller sign it, ordinary business law applies.  The form would run something like:
"In consideration of X bitcoins paid to address Y, I promise to deliver Z product to (buyer info).
&lt;Seller signature and other ID here&gt;"
The only difference between this contract and any run of the mill contract is the consideration.  Instead of dollars it is specified as some number of bitcoins.

Based on inventions made by society before hand.  Can anyone do a Hollywood blockbuster without the English language, electricity, the Catmull-Clark shading algorithm (used in computer graphics), or musical instruments (for the score)? No, nobody creates anything any more without using a vast base of existing technology and knowledge.
The deal we have set up is that in return for getting to use all the previous creations of civilization for free, you get to control your new addition for a limited time, after which it goes into the pool of free stuff for the next generation to use.
The problem is the law is now slanted too far in favor of new additions, so that essentially things never enter the public domain.

Artists like Lady Gaga give away a billion views of her music videos.  The scarce item she sells is seats to her concerts.  So there are plenty of economic models that don't involve trying to charge for items that can be reproduced at trivial cost.

Electronic data can be easily copied, changed, and transmitted.  For electronic cash you don't want the first two properties, because that allows counterfeiting and forging transactions.  In the past you needed a trusted third party, like a bank, to hold the accounts database secure, and prevent copying or changing.
Satoshi proposed a distributed network where everyone has a copy of the accounts database and verifies incoming transactions themselves. To prevent spending the same balance twice by sending it off to different people, only the first transaction is considered valid.  How "first" is determined is "first to be included in a block of transactions verified by a hash (checksum) based on the contents of the block".  The hash can be used to check that the contents of the block have not been changed, because changing even one bit of data in the contents completely changes the resulting hash.
By including the hash of the previous block in the contents of the current block, you would have to tamper with both blocks to change an earlier transaction.  That's because the hash of the changed earlier block would no longer match the hash recorded in the contents of the current one.  If you do this with all the blocks, they formed a linked chain, where you can detect any changes anywhere in the transaction history.  This way, everyone can check that the entire transaction history is unaltered simply by calculating the hash of each block, and seeing it matches the value listed in the next one.
The hash value also is required to be especially low (lots of leading zeroes).  This is achieved by throwing an extra random number into the block contents, along with the transactions and the previous hash.  The only way to find a sufficiently low value is to try lots of random numbers, because hash values by design vary randomly from their contents.  
Thus anyone trying to create a fake transaction is forced to do the work to find a proper hash for the block.  They are in competition with everyone else working on finding a hash for a block of genuine transactions.  The majority of honest workers is thus more likely to find the hash first, and therefore we accept the longest series of fastest produced blocks as being the true history of transactions.  The incentive for people to work on blocks is they get to reward themselves with newly created bitcoins.  In effect everyone else is paying the accountants who keep the account books by letting them pay themselves.
By only accepting the first transaction recorded in the chain of blocks (or "block chain" as we call it), you prevent spending the same balance twice.  By forcing a lot of work to find proper hashes, you prevent anyone from going back and changing old data.  By using a distributed network where everyone has a copy of the block chain, you don't need any trusted central authority to run things.  Everyone can check the data on their own.
Thus the problems that electronic data can be easily copied and changed is solved.  This particular data **cannot** be easily copied, only the first transaction is valid.  It also cannot be easily changed, the work to find proper hashes prevents it.  It still can be easily transmitted via a peer-to-peer network.  So we have a system with the properties we need for decentralized electronic cash.

It is not anonymous, but it also does not record personal info with transactions, just bitcoin addresses and amounts.  This is unlike paper checks or credit cards, where your name is printed right on them, and your bank knows who you are.

That will be derived from the average holding time of the coins and the volume of real transactions they are used for.  If people only hold them for hours, you don't need much value per coin to satisfy demand, and their price will be low.  If people hold them for years, you will need a much higher value on them, because the daily volume in trade will be low.
The block chain tells us how much in total transactions happen in a day or a year, but we don't know how much of that coin movement is in trade for other goods vs. just moving them to another wallet of the same owner.  It sets an upper bound on "coin velocity".  Velocity is just the inverse of holding time, in years.  Velocity can also be thought of as "turn over", how many times the average coin is used per year.
Holding time will be a distribution, from lost coins that never move to ones bought on the spot for an immediate purchase, thus hours or minutes.  You can still work out an average though.
Estimated transaction volume (excluding change) has been holding steady at ~$50M/day, but that does not count off-chain transactions.

I figured the average time over the entire history of bitcoin (3 years 10 months/210,000 blocks) to the first halving.  Nobody can predict the future, but the past is the best data to extrapolate from.  So that was one estimate.  The other is a flat 4 years, which assumes no average increase in difficulty.  I think those two estimates span the reasonable range.
One day is no good for a baseline, because the hash rate varies by +/- 20% on a daily basis.

You need to separate the utility value and currency unit value, they are different things.  A cheeseburger has utility value, because we all need to eat to live.  Gold has utility value too, as a good conductor that does not oxidize, and because it makes pretty jewelry that makes people happy.  But on top of that we assign additional value as a commodity in trade, and that additional value is set by collective demand, which is based on opinion rather than utility.
Bitcoin has utility value in a secure accounting database and payment network.  Just like we pay UPS to move physical objects, we are willing to pay to use Bitcoin to move funds.  Whether Satoshi had defined the limit at 21 billion units instead of 21 million would make no difference to the utility.
Collective demand for *holding* units (BTC) is what sets the market price.  BTC are exchanged for goods and services, including other currencies.  In between exchanges they are held in an account number.  If the average user exchanges their coins once a year, then the value must be equal to the volume of goods and services they were exchanged for.  If they are exchanged ten times a year on average, then their value per exchange is 1/10 the annual volume.
Thus the longer people hold onto their coins, the more they end up being worth, relative to the volume of goods and services being traded for.

Moving your money elsewhere is not a new thing to do.  "Offshoring", as it's called, is a massive business.  In fact, a lot of the deposits in Cyprus banks come from Russians who thought it was a safer place to store their money than at home.  Turns out they were wrong, but they already knew to move their funds.
Bitcoin is new international currency option, but likely most Cypriots will choose what they perceive as a "safe country" to move money to.  Likely that will be places like Germany, UK, US, Switzerland, etc.  In other words, the same havens *most* people in unstable countries have been using for generations.  Bitcoin has to build up a reputation as a safe haven, and that takes time.

In this case, I was just providing data for the general readership, that they can use to refute the media or dumb general comments about what bitcoin is used for.
Another data point is that between Coinbase and BitPay, they have 22,000 merchants signed up.  Presumably none of those sell illegal drugs, because the two processors don't want to get shut down.  22,000 is thus the minimum number of places you can spend bitcoins legally.  It doesn't count all the other merchants that accept bitcoin and take care of converting it themselves (or keep the coins, or spend them again without converting).

You underestimate human creativity.  They may not go entirely underground, but they can certainly hide some of their activity. 
First, lets get definitions straight.  Black market refers to illegal activity, and "off the books" refers to legal but unreported activity.  Combined they are the "underground economy" (
There are plenty of ways for brick and mortar stores (or their employees) to make underground money.  I will give a few examples.  Convenience store selling untaxed cigarettes.  Reporting goods damaged or stolen, but actually sold to customers or to another store.  Phantom employees (often family) to increase expenses.  I could go on for pages.
Sometimes going underground requires paying bribes to the right people to "look the other way".  Sometimes a brick and mortar location is a front to launder true black market income.

Imagine an account book that uses arbitrary units, and new entries are simply transfers of units from one account to another.  At it's root, that is all the Bitcoin system is: an account book that records entries of transactions.  Only instead of a paper ledger, or Excel spreadsheet, this account book is distributed in many copies online.  And the transaction entries are locked in place with cryptography, so it is very hard to tamper with the history.
Since the account book is maintained by a P2P network, anyone anywhere with a decent internet connection can get a copy of it, create account numbers, and start to make transactions.  The network is designed to only accept transactions if you had enough balance in the account to spend.  As long as people are willing to use this account book to exchange their balance for other goods and services, the ease of use and world-wide range will make the exchange rate something more than zero.
Since the number of arbitrary units (called bitcoins or BTC) is limited, they are a scarce commodity.  New coins are only handed out by lottery for helping maintain the security of the account book, and at a known rate (about 3600 per day at present).  This rate will drop over time until no more coins are added to the system.  So their scarcity will remain, like any other finite commodity (gold, shares of Apple stock, land).  The value in exchange for other things will be set simply by supply and demand.

That just means that your opinion of the price disagrees with the consensus opinion of a lot of other people, formed by supply and demand on the exchanges.  It's OK to disagree with the market, but if you have good reason to value bitcoins at less than the current market, then the correct thing to do is not to buy.


I "dollar cost average", meaning I buy a set amount each week measured in dollars.  Therefore I automatically buy more bitcoins when the price is low.  This is a standard investment method for long term investors.

I don't see people massively shifting those trillions in tax havens to bitcoin to store value.  Those trillions are invested in real estate, stocks, and other standard items (you didn't think they were just sitting in vaults in the Cayman Islands, did you?).
The tax havens are just there to hide ownership, or grant more stability than your native country.  Where bitcoin may come in use is a private way to *move funds* from one account to another, without leaving a trail for governments to follow.  For that purpose, I can imagine some fraction of a percent being held as bitcoin, which still leads to a hundred billion in value.

Since you have an engineering background, consider the idea of distributed production with bitcoin as the payment method.  For example, if someone wants a coffee table made, they select a builder, and post the required payment as an escrowed bitcoin transaction.  The builder sees the payment, since all transactions are public.  He proceeds to order parts and materials from suppliers, also in bitcoins.  On delivery, the payment is released.
Now also consider that as automation and robotics becomes more prevalent, the whole production chain can become automated, including the payments, because bitcoin is programmable money.

The way I look at it, there are two bitcoin entities.  The "Bitcoin Network" consists of the software, apps, block chain database, and nodes and miners with their computers and specialized hardware.  This network performs a useful function - moving money from place to place.  That's the same function that PayPal and Western Union perform.  To the extent the Bitcoin Network has better features than the alternatives, it generates a demand to use it.
The other bitcoin entity is the unit of account in the block chain, and there are a limited number of units.  Since the only way to use the network is to have some bitcoin units (even if only for a minute), demand to use the network creates a demand for the units.
Besides immediate use for purchases, where you send money to a merchant, there is also sending money to yourself in the future, otherwise known as savings.  To the extent that some bitcoins are in a long-term trip to the future, they are not available for immediate use.  This reduces the limited number for purchases, and by supply and demand, drives up their exchange rate.
The Network has a value in and of itself, because it is useful, just like an automobile or personal computer is useful.  Thus it does not need backing by anything else.  The bitcoin units get their value from the demand to use them, which is made up of moving money in time (savings) and space (spending).

Take a read on this:
$500 billion market with 9.3% average fees.  For moving money.  I think bitcoin can own that market. 
The average holding time for bitcoins is ~60 days (it fluctuates though).  This is made up of everyone from long term holders like Satoshi Nakamoto, whose coins have never moved, to traders and remitters, who would be short-term holders.  But we can use the average to estimate value.  60 days translates to a turnover rate of 6x per year.  If that turnover includes $500 billion of remittances, then the average demand is $500 billion/6 =  $83 billion.
Bitcoin won't take over the remittance market in one year, so let's assume 5-10 years.  By then there will be ~16-20 million coins generated, thus a value of $4-5K/coin.  That's just from remittances, not including any other use for bitcoin.

There are a couple of good references here: 
That page is part of a Wikibook I started on the subject ( and the back part of the book is a design-in-progress for such a factory.  The book is far from done, but I chose Wikibooks because it makes collaboration easier, and I wanted to open-source the designs.
I don't think "micro-manufacturing" is an especially good term.  If you are producing robotic farm tractors to grow your food, and building materials for a house, the factory will be industrial warehouse size, rather than garage or desktop size.  I prefer "community-scale production", where the equipment is owned by a local community.
The concept is flexible.  For example, you can have a set of people, each of which owns a different specialized machine.  When one of them wants a product, orders are sent to the various machines to make their respective parts.  Some kind of accounting system would then settle up the net credits and debits for using the equipment.  It might be more efficient to have all the equipment in one place, like a conventional factory.  With modern computers and networks, though, distributed rather than centralized production is an option.
My personal preference is to set up something like a Credit Union, where members pool smaller amounts of money to buy the initial factory hardware and materials, and then share in the outputs it produces.  That would lower the initial cost per person.

That's just so much scaremongering BS.  The US built too much real estate because of easy financing:
Then it collapsed, and remained low for several years because there was an oversupply of houses. offices, and malls.  Remove 3% of GDP from construction spending, and the upstream materials suppliers (lumber, roofing, etc), and the downstream effects (construction worker spending, real estate agencies, mortgage businesses, etc.) multiplies the effect.
Thus we have had high unemployment, which the Fed has tried to fix by low interest rates to stimulate the economy.  You can see that construction spending is now recovering, and unemployment is heading back to the "normal" range (5-6%):
So their need to keep pumping money into the system to keep interest rates low will decrease.  They don't want to shock the financial system, which has gotten used to low rates. So they have been telegraphing their intent to ramp down the QE program.

The bitcoin "bank" is the block chain, that is where account balances and transactions are stored.  You will note that conventional banks also keep track of account balances and transactions, it is one of their basic functions.  They just do it in a computer room somewhere in the back of the bank.
The other functions that conventional banks do, besides track balances and transactions, are moved elsewhere with the bitcoin network.  Creating new accounts you do on your PC or a website.  Clearing transactions is done on a P2P network.
Since the block chain and transaction clearing happen worldwide, I think it fits the definition of "offshore", at least in the sense of not being tied to a location in one country.  You could also call it "transnational", meaning it ignores national borders.
I don't think it is right to say you are "getting your money out of the system altogether", because bitcoin is very much a system.  It would not function without rules and a network.  It's just a different system than the government/central bank one.

The hash value is *also* a checksum on the contents of the block, and therefore verifies that the included transactions are not falsified by someone changing the block.  Because the right kind of hash (with a low value set by the difficulty) is difficult to find, the contents of the block are difficult to fake.
Thus the work being done is "making the block chain hard to maliciously edit".  Since each block includes the hash of the previous block in its contents, they form a chain (hence the name "block chain").  Thus to change the contents of any given block, you would have to find new hashes for every block after it.  That's part of why we wait several blocks to confirm a transaction.
Perhaps you still see "making the block chain history hard to change" as busywork, but I see it as a necessary feature of a payment system.  If you can't depend on the record of transactions, it is pretty useless.

Assuming you are in the US, they would likely treat it as foreign currency exchange, which you later sold for goods and services of some value in dollars.  An individual traveling to France, who buys Euro for spending money on the trip, isn't holding the Euro long enough for the exchange rate to vary and make a gain or loss when they spend it.
A big corporation, though, that does business in different countries, does have to track foreign exchange gains and losses if they hold the currency long enough and the value changes.  Foreign currency is just another asset that you can have a capital gain or loss from.  Thus, with bitcoins, if you bought a coin for US $50, and sell it for $500 in goods and serives, you had a $450 gain.  Then you get to argue over what the fair value of the goods you traded for was.

That's the mistake right there.  Bitcoin was designed to be a medium of exchange, for which it works very well.  If you want a store of value, use bitcoins to buy real estate, stocks, gold, or whatever.
Bitcoin doesn't represent a long-term store of value, because the value of 1.000 BTC depends on demand for current transactions.  If  nobody used it for transactions, the price would fall to zero, which is the situation bitcoin was in before the First Pizza (I will ignore other uses for the block chain in this analysis)
If a better technology for a transactions system comes along, bitcoin will be replaced, the volume would decline, and so would the price.  In the short term the value is going up, because adoption is going up (plus speculation on future adoption adds more demand).  But we should not expect the value to go up forever.

It's not clear which part of the comment you don't get, so I will try on both:


Most banks operate using "fractional reserve banking".  Depositors first put money into a bank.  The bank then makes loans based on those deposits.  They give a loan check to the borrower, who can then go cash it or deposit it somewhere else.  But the original depositors that supplied the money for the loan can also take out cash.
Making a loan without actually removing the depositor funds and giving it to the borrower creates a new asset on the bank's books - the loan balance owed to them.  But that asset is created out of thin air.


In the USA, the Federal Reserve buys Treasury bonds (and these days, crappy mortgages) and pays for them with dollars it creates out of thin air.  Those dollars appear as credits on the account of the bank or brokerage that sold them the bonds, or in the case of banks who need paper currency, are delivered as stacks of fresh bills.  There is no limit to how many dollars the Fed can create this way.
The bitcoin software has rules for accepting new blocks to add to the block chain.  One of these rules is that the amount in the "generation" transaction which creates new bitcoins is cut in half every 210,000 blocks (about 4 years).  It started at 50 BTC/block, and in late 2012 we hit block 210,000 and it was cut to 25 BTC/block.  It will keep getting cut in half, which means there is a limit to how many new bitcoins will ever be created.

The best data we have is from blockchain.info:
By its nature we cannot tell if a given bitcoin transaction is a trade for other goods and services, or merely moving funds among accounts of a single person.  That graph estimates transaction volume by trying to remove "change" amounts, but cannot eliminate self-movements.  We can make a reasonable assumption that the *percentage* of self-moves of funds is constant. Thus the trend of real trades is correct, even if the absolute amount is unknown.
At some point other statistics and surveys will enable estimating the self-moves, but for the moment we will just have to treat it as an unknown.

I joined the Open Source Ecology project when I heard about it (you will find my user name in their forums and wiki), and designed/prototyped a few items.
The problem I ran into as an engineer is the GVCS is not an "ecology" as the name implies, not a linked system.  I could not find an analysis that showed those are the right 50 machines, what sizes they need to be, or what order they should be built in.  Living ecologies also have finite amounts of energy and material resources that cycle through them, and I could not find any "resource accounting" for the GVCS to show it is in balance.  If this missing work is available, please point me to it, there isn't a need for me to repeat it.
So, not finding this data, I am doing is what I am trained to do as a systems engineer (  ). I'm starting from the desired outputs that people want (food, shelter, utilities) and working backwards to identify what systems are needed to produce those outputs, and in turn what starter set can build up to those systems. I am doing the sizing analysis (how big to make things), tracking energy and raw materials budgets, how much land is needed, etc.
I fully credit the OSE project for their enthusiasm and getting hardware built, but enthusiastically building the wrong hardware isn't very useful.  So yes, what I am doing is more thinking and less hands-on welding at the moment, but I hope it is worthwhile thinking.

It would be nice to see a mention of what drives merchant adoption.  Credit card fraud amounts to 3% of global credit card transactions, and bank fees add another couple of percent.  Merchants thus have potentially 5% of their revenue to gain from a better payment network.

Well, saying the dollar is not backed by anything is incorrect, though a popular idea. The US dollar is technically backed like this (amounts in millions):
  
    Federal Reserve notes to be collateralized                         1,160,510
    Gold certificate account                                              11,037  
    Special drawing rights certificate account                             5,200  
    U.S. Treasury, agency debt, and mortgage-backed securities (1,2)   1,144,273
1.  Includes face value of U.S. Treasury, agency debt, and mortgage-backed securities held outright, compensation to adjust for the effect of inflation on the original face value of inflation-indexed securities, and cash value of repurchase agreements.                                                
2.  Includes securities lent to dealers under the overnight securities lending facility... 
Source:  (table 10)
The problem with this is not that there is no backing, but the accounting is bogus.  Gold certificates were issued to the Fed by the Treasury in 1934, when the Treasury seized all the nation's gold. They represent claims on gold coins valued at the statutory rate of $42.22/oz, thus representing 267 million ounces of gold.  Of course, the current market value of gold is much higher, and fluctuates.  But on the other hand, the Fed has no way to redeem the certificates for the actual gold without the Treasury's permission.  Presumably the gold is held at Fort Knox.
Thus the value is either zero, if there is no way to cash in the certificates for actual gold, or it's worth $373 billion at current market value of the gold.  Either way, it's not the quoted amount.
The main backing is a mix of government debt and mortgage securities.  These are reported at face value.  But Treasury debt has a variable value in the market, and the mortgage backed securities were bought from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, who were in financial trouble because of the collapse of the housing market.  The houses backing those mortgages are no longer worth enough to back the loans (are underwater), and thus the securities are worth much less than face value.
Thus the collateral that supposedly backs Federal Reserve Notes (i.e. paper money dollars) is highly questionable.
The rest of the money supply is created by lending.  You deposit cash at a bank.  The bank then makes a loan from customer deposits to someone.  They take the loan check and deposit it somewhere else.  Now there are two balances based on the same deposited cash - your original deposit, and the one from the loan check.  The bank shows as an asset the loan they made, and as a liability your deposit.  So their books balance, but you have two people thinking they have money, when there was only one before the loan.  The additional money was created by making a loan, and thus the loan (a promise to repay) is the backing for the additional money supply.
Since banks can loan out all but the required reserves, a single deposit of cash gets multiplied by a chain of loans across multiple banks.  Thus most of the money supply is backed by bank loans.

It's not bitcoin itself, but the Block Chain technology of a distributed record keeping system.
The real invention in bitcoin is using chained hashes to securely store data, without having to trust any central authority.  We happen to use it to store monetary transactions, but it can be used to store *any data whatsoever*.  That includes records of stock ownership, real estate deeds, business contracts, proof of intellectual property, or scientific data.
Other data types than monetary transactions have different content sizes and need for fast delivery, so I would expect a separate block chain than the bitcoin one.  It would have somewhat different parameters, with "mining" (i.e. hash verification) done by brokers, county courthouses, public accountants, and anyone else interested in a verifiable records system.

The same argument should be true of an S&amp;P 500 index fund, which has increased 100-fold since 1950, a lot more than inflation:
Do people "hoard" S&amp;P 500 funds?  Well, we don't call it hoarding, we call it investing.  And people do invest for their future, but they still spend on food, housing, utilities, and other short-term needs.  The fact that people have short-term needs means an economy will still function, even if it has currency deflation.  It just means people will tend to save more and borrow less, which is actually a good thing.

There are several ways to protect yourself when doing an in-person transaction with a stranger.  Which of the following you use is up to you:
* Do the deal in front of a neutral third party.  Your local bank or credit union may be willing, or anyone who does notary service, even a local check cashing service.  The point is having someone watch the transaction.  Ask them ahead of time, and a small fee for their time is appropriate.
* Request the other party bring a photocopy of their ID, and the actual ID.  Compare and exchange copies of the ID before doing the bitcoin and cash deal.  If it goes wonky, you have a copy of their ID to track them down.
* Prepare a sales contract ahead of time, with blank spaces for the $ and BTC amounts, and account numbers.  Make two copies, both of you sign.  Then you do the currency exchange.  Example wording:
"In consideration of _________ US dollars paid in cash by the buyer, the seller promises to deliver _________ units of the Bitcoin virtual currency to  _____(name)______ at account number _____________________.
Seller's signature________________________ date  ________
Buyer's signature________________________ date  ________
TO BE FILLED IN AFTER DELIVERY:

Thank you.  I didn't expect an actual surge of ASICs, which appears to have happened.  The network is pushing over 50 Thash/s, and the number of coins has indeed hit 10.93 million already.  I also didn't expect the market price to rise so fast, to 74 at the moment, so we are already at over $800 million market cap.  Talk of "almost a billion dollars in value" may start any time now in the media and help propel the hype.  I don't have a feel for how close we would need to get for writers to start rounding up to a billion.  
My personal favorite way to put the bitcoin trading network in context is national money supplies.  The way I see it, people willing to trade goods and services is the real value backing the bitcoin network.  The coins themselves are just markers in the accounts database (block chain) we use to keep track.  The network of people using bitcoin constitute an economy in the same way the people using national currencies do.  By accepting a shared marker, they can trade with each other without resorting to barter.
In national currency terms, bitcoin's money supply is now larger than 37 nations, between Djibouti at $798 million and Turkmenistan at $829 million.  That is pretty impressive given that two years ago it would be listed dead last.

If you look at a paper check or a bank card (credit or debit) it has your name and account number together on one artifact.  It therefore links the two by default.  Bitcoin does not include your name as part of a transaction, thus does not link it to the account number in the transaction by default.
Perfect anonymity isn't possible, but bitcoin is a big step in that direction.  That is sufficient to gain adoption for the people who care about privacy.  I mean, if you go shopping and pay with cash, the store likely has video cameras, so you are not really anonymous there either.  Once the facial recognition software gets better, the stores will greet you by name, like we have seen in sci-fi movies.

It's actually not a new idea, I picked it up somewhere in creative real estate finance literature.  I've been selling a previous home to my tenant that way.  I own it outright, and they are earning 20% of the rent payment towards the purchase.  They have an option to buy at any time, so if they move out, they can find a regular buyer, execute the option in a "dual closing", and keep the difference between what the balance they owe me, and whatever the new buyer pays them.
A dual closing is where ownership is transferred twice in a single session with the attorney, it's just a bit of extra paperwork.

The comments on ZeroHedge are pretty bad, and one of them brings up this tired argument:


I've been mentally working out an explanation of why it doesn't matter, and will post it here in the hopes the rest of you can sharpen and improve it:
Consider a UPS truck.  What backs it's value?  The answer is nothing, it has utility value in and of itself by its ability to deliver packages.  That utility value does not depend on the value of the packages it transports.  Instead, it depends on how efficiently it performs the delivery function relative to other ways of doing so (hand carrying, using your car to deliver the package yourself, etc.)
Similarly, the Internet isn't backed by anything else.  Routers, fiber optic cables, and all the other stuff that make up the Internet have inherent usefulness by their ability to deliver data.  Their utility value comes from being able to deliver the data more efficiently than the alternatives (printed paper, DVD disks, physically shipping hard drives, etc.)  Again, the value of the data being transported across the Internet is separate from the value of the Internet hardware.  It can be used to transport funny cat videos, or software that sells for thousands of dollars.
Finally, consider the Bitcoin network.  It has utility value in and of itself by the ability to transport financial value from place to place.  That utility value depends on doing its job more efficiently than other ways to transport financial value (cash, credit cards, etc.).  The utility value again does not depend on the magnitude of the financial value being delivered.
You can't eat a bitcoin address balance, or use it to heat your house.  It does not have a utility value in and of itself.  It is only a component part of the Bitcoin network, which delivers financial value either in space or time.  The delivery in space is when you send a transaction to another person in another location.  This is the "medium of exchange" function.  The delivery in time is when you exchange something else of value now for a balance, and some time later exchange the balance back to something else of useful value.  This is the "store of value" function.
The total amount of address balances (i.e. bitcoins generated) only grows relatively slowly.  If the demand for delivering value in time and space goes up, then necessarily the unit value of a balance will also go up.  But the unit value is not directly connected to the efficiency value of the network.  That exists of itself as long as it is better than the alternatives.  The unit value comes from the demand of users.
From this I conclude that backing of bitcoins by something else of value is not needed or relevant.  The network has value of itself, and balances have value due to demand from users.

That is a perversion of the meaning of "backing".  Backing is the collateral a local bank supplies to the Fed to obtain circulating notes and coin (i.e cash).  If they return the cash, they get their collateral back.
What you are listing is the market or economy for which dollars can be used in exchange.  If everyone stopped accepting dollars in exchange, they would become useless.  However their backing, the collateral deposited to obtain the cash, would still remain in theory.
In practice, everyone stopping to accept dollars in the market is such a radical change, I can't predict what would happen to the economy or the government.

I edited the wikibooks page to reflect our previous discussion.  Hopefully it is clearer now.
The book as a whole is an exploration of the principles and design for self-expanding production, where self-expanding means you produce more factory equipment along with useful end products.  I am doing several design examples as a way to identify what is similar or different in starter kits and growth paths when the applications for the factory changes.  The distributed network is different from, say, a centralized industrial factory, even if both are "grown" from a starter kit.
At this point, I don't have all the answers, however you are helping me identify what the questions are that need answers.  I cannot yet prove a distributed network makes economic sense compared to specialized factories that mass produce things.  But until we had things like bitcoin to handle payments between nodes, and relatively cheap computer-driven fabrication machines, we could not even consider such a distributed network at all.
On the question of why build it, one example is private individuals who each have one or two pieces of workshop equipment.  The network would allow them to collaborate on making things for each other that no single person could complete on their own.
Another is that a public record of orders and completed payments can serve as a reputation system for producers.  Unfortunately there are a lot of businesses who provide terrible service, but it is hard for you to discover that.  If you can observe that they completed 99% of the orders within the specified time and were paid out of escrow 100% of the time, that is an independent measure of their reputation.

The major theme is how the reduction in information costs will change society.  Fast and cheap money transfer is only a part of that.
Pyramid-style organizations simplify information flow - you only had to deal with one superior and your subordinates on a regular basis.  When information is expensive, such as when factory production and distributor sales reports had to be compiled by hand, that made sense.  When information is cheap, and those reports are generated automatically in real time and can go straight to the top, the pyramid becomes less useful.
Paper checks are information flow.  They are a message from the writer of the check to their bank to give some amount of money to the payee.  You sent the check to the payee, who then gave it to their own bank, who in turn passed that message through the banking system, generating a counterflow of money at each step, until it got back to your own bank.
You needed banks and clearinghouses because passing individual checks around is more expensive than grouping them into bulk packages and making one settlement payment between banks at the clearinghouse.  With cheap information, bitcoin transactions can travel individually from address to address.  So you don't need central organizations to handle them in bulk.
More generally, networks become relatively more efficient than pyramids and centralized systems.  That does not mean networks replace everything, but they become much more common.

Later blocks count as added confirmations .
Each block after the one with a transaction includes the hash of the previous block in its calculation.  So any attempt to change that transaction invalidates the hash of every block after it.  In order for the network to accept the change, you must publish a valid chain of blocks faster than the whole rest of the network combined.  That requires you to have more computing power than the whole rest of the network.  
The longer this does not happen, the more unlikely it becomes.  Thus people can be more comfortable that a given transaction will never change.

ASICs are running around 0.2GHash/s/Watt, and rising.  Given the speed of the network as a whole, that implies 27 MW to run the whole mining collective.  For comparison, the Titan supercomputer draws 8.2 MW (  ).
Banks consume about 3.1 Watts/square foot, assuming the "Office" category from  Therefore the Citicorp building in New York City (1.3 million square feet) consumes 4 MW.
There are an estimated 630,000 bank branches worldwide, so the bitcoin network consumes an estimated 42W/branch, equivalent to 14 square feet of office space.  I don't have data for the *size* of bank branches, but I suspect the average is quite a bit larger than 14 sqft.

The current exponential growth of bitcoin value has to stop in a relatively short time.  Otherwise it would exceed the total value of everything on the planet.
For example, let's take the total economic production of the human race over all of history, which is on the order of $2500 trillion.  That places an upper bound on asset values, since come production, like food, gets used up and not accumulate.  Bitcoin currently has a total value of $1000/coin x 12 million coins = $12 billion.  If it keeps increasing ten-fold in value per year, it would reach the economic limits of $2500 trillion in just 5.5 years.
Sometime between now and 5.5 years from now, the growth in value will have to slow down, and stabilize around actual economic use of bitcoin to buy stuff.  My personal feeling is the current price already factors in future growth in use that hasn't happened yet, and use needs to catch up, but regardless, people will reach a limit in bidding up the price of bitcoin when they run out of money to convert.

The average bitcoin changes hands 8 times a year.  That is not too different than the US Dollar M1 "velocity" (annual turnover rate).  So they don't sit in a basement, they facilitate trade.  People trade because there is some perceived advantage to doing so, either profit, or they want something enough to give up something else, usually money.
If we use the corporate average net profit of 7% as a proxy for the value gained from all trade, then the Bitcoin network facilitates 56% of its own value per year.  I'd say that is worthwhile.

The block chain is the history of every bitcoin transaction ever made.  A block is just a set of transactions with a hash value.  The hash ensures the contents of the block are correct.  Since the contents includes the hash of the previous block, it also validates the contents of the previous block, all the way back to the very first one.  If you changed even a single transaction anywhere in the block chain, all the hashes from that point forward would no longer be correct.  A permanent and un-editable history of transactions is central to why bitcoin works.
Each full client, like Bitcoin-QT, downloads the whole block chain, then validates all the transactions and hashes.  Since there are thousands of copies of the block chain, each independently checking, it is basically impossible to ever modify past transactions.  Thus if you have a balance at a given address, you can be pretty sure it will still be there in a decade or two.
That's how bitcoin can dispense with central authorities.  Everyone is an accountant, and everyone has a copy of the books.  If you piddle around with small amounts, it may not be worth hosting a full client.  If your bitcoin stash is worth more than the computer, it is in your own self-interest to devote a small part of the computer's hard drive space and computing power to keeping the account books secure.

To a first approximation, everyone in the world has a mobile phone:
Worldwide, there are 0.962 mobiles/person.  In Africa, which has the lowest level, it is 0.635/person.  When you subtract out children too young to have their own phone and the disabled who are unable to use them, the ratio reaches unity worldwide.
For Africa, 15.2% of the population is under 5 years old:
 (see last table)
If we use that figure for "too young or unable to use a phone", then the ratio becomes 0.635/84.2% = 0.749 mobiles/able adult.

The NSA gathers data from multiple sources, then correlates them to look for interesting patterns.  The block chain is just one more data source, and a trivially easy one to get access to, since it's public.  What you and I don't have is giant data centers and taps on information flows to provide all the *other* databases to match against.
Example:  An encrypted email is sent from an internet cafe.  That by itself is not very interesting.  Wireless records show 6 cell phones were in the cafe at the time.  One of these phones occasionally calls Egypt.  Now this starts to become an interesting pattern, so more databases are consulted to see if more unlikely events are connected to the first two.  All this happens automatically.  If enough things match up, the pattern is sent to a human to review.

You are correct.  The story was recorded by Henry of Huntingdon in his *Historia Anglorum* in the mid-12th century, about 100 years after Cnut lived.  Henry was an archdeacon, a secular cleric, and was not above embellishing his history with stories that teach a lesson, i.e. a parable.  Given that Cnut's own recordkeepers do not record the event, it was probably made up by Henry
In this case, it is a parable of futility in the face of a greater power, namely God, who Henry believed controlled the tides.  The point was to warn people against the sin of pride - thinking you are more important than you actually are.  
The US government attempting to change something based on mathematics is very much a parallel story of futility.  But instead of God punishing them for the sin of pride, we laugh at them for being silly, which perhaps is a worse punishment.  Laughter undermines the illusion of power that governments use to support themselves.

Historically, as far back as civilization has existed, the rich and powerful have wanted to preserve and increase their wealth and power, because humans are self-interested, and want advantages for their family and friends.  The tools have varied over time - state religion, armies, a legal system, but the goal has remained the same.
Wealthy individuals, corporations, and governments are just different types of concentrated wealth and power.  Rather than thinking of them as one running the other, you should think of them as a linked network of influence.  As an example, Chelsea Clinton, daughter of Bill and Hillary, has parents in politics, she is in media, and her husband is a Goldman-Sachs banker.  When they get together for dinner, you have multiple aspects of the money and power structure interacting.
Similarly, it is very common for people to cross over from one side of the system to another.  A former boss of mine at Boeing used to be a Marine officer working in procurement (government), who then went to work for a government contractor delivering hardware (corporation).

They are not free, they are reward for the work of validating a block of transactions.


A set of bitcoin transactions, including one that generates new coins, plus the hash of the previous block.  Mining is finding a new hash (checksum) that meets difficult conditions.  The hash guarantees that the contents of the block are unchanged.  Since it includes the hash value of the previous block, it also validates that block's contents also.  This makes a chain all the way to the first block and transaction.   That's why we call it the "block chain".
Making sure that the history of transactions is verifiable and unchanged is central to the utility of bitcoin as a currency.  If you could not be sure of your or other account's balances, nobody would use it.


There is no they.  The miner who first finds the difficult to find hash gets to include a "generation" transaction for brand new coins, directed at themselves.  Although a proper hash is hard to find, it is trivial to check, so the rest of the network will accept the new block, including the self-payment, only if it is valid.  That adds the new block to the chain of 265,000 existing blocks on everyone's copy of the block chain.  Then miners set about working on the next one.
As I said before, a valid history of transactions is essential to know which bitcoin address, and thus the ownership of, every existing coin balance is assigned to.  By making the right hash hard to find, it forces a competition among miners, so that no one person can write the history of transactions.  If you can do that, it opens the possibility of abuse.

I disagree.  People who need to "offshore" large amounts of funds (move them to another country for tax or legal reasons) use big banks.  I know that because *I watched it happen* when I worked in the check clearing operation of a big Wall Street bank.  My job was totaling daily deposits for South American correspondent banks.  I could see the deposits for exactly $1 million from tiny banks in no-name towns in Colombia.
Offshoring is a mix of legal, semi-legal, and illegal funds transfer.  Google, like most big transnational corporations, does it to avoid taxes, by parking profits in places like Ireland.  Corrupt politicians park their funds in tax havens for the day they are out of office.  Drug cartels need to do something with the money they accumulate, and usually that is to move the money to a place with less taxes and corruption than their home country.  All of these people take advantage of the best legal and accounting minds available *because they can afford it*

Even if those bankers don't know about Bitcoin, they certainly know about "offshoring", the movement of money to another country for some advantage (taxes, more stability, etc.).  The majority of the deposits in Cyprus were imported from other countries for just that reason.
If the money can come in, it can just as easily go out again, to another country, even from the local residents for whom their deposits were not offshored.  It's quite possible for the majority of savings to leave the country, leaving just day-to-day spending balances.
This is not an effect of bitcoin, it is the ease of mobility of capital in general.  People everywhere can use the internet to research banks and investments world-wide, and then send funds by more traditional means.  All you need is a mailing address or a bank routing number.

That's a bogus argument anyway.  People need to satisfy immediate needs like food, shelter, gasoline, and utilities.  They won't stop spending for those just because the currency value is increasing.
What it affects is decisions on savings and investment.  Bitcoin would compete with real estate, stocks, and bonds in terms of return.

But they are still going to spend on necessities, and business will still have to pay expenses, so there will be a functioning economy.

A block chain is a secure record-keeping system.  Bitcoin just happens to use it for storing transaction data, but block hashes can verify *any* kind of data whatsoever.  If the data itself is too big to include in the block, use hashes of the data to verify the data existed at a point in time and what it contained.
Who would pay for such a system?  Anyone that wants tamper-proof record keeping, which is an awful lot of people.  Maintaining the block chain could be done exclusively for "record fees", since unlike bitcoin, we don't need to make an initial distribution of coins.

It goes to the network nodes her client is connected to.  They each verify it against the block chain history + pool of new transactions they keep locally.  If the transaction is good, they forward it to other nodes, until everyone has it in their new transaction pool.


Each client has a pool of new transactions that are received and verified, but not yet included in a block.


Miners attempt to form new blocks out of their local pool of new transactions, in order to claim the block reward + transaction fees.  You have to find a sufficiently low hash value by trying different random numbers (nonce) as part of the content of the block.  If you succeed, your software publishes the new block to the network, which also goes via P2P flooding to everyone.  Transactions which are part of the block get removed from the new transaction pool by all clients, and the block itself gets added to the stored block chain.
When a miner receives a new block from the network, any work they did themselves to that point was wasted, like a losing lottery ticket.  So they update their block chain and new transaction pool like everyone else, and start over.

It's distributed tamper-proof record-keeping.  For a monetary transaction system, such record-keeping is a necessary function.  But a monetary system is not the *only* place you would like to keep such records.  Consider a video recording entered as evidence in a trial, or a business contract.  Hash the contents, put them on a block chain system, and you have proof the electronic originals were not tampered with.
In the early days of written records, you impressed a message into clay, and used a carved seal of the ruler or scribe to sign it, then *baked the clay* which made it tamper-proof.  In the paper era, you could use a wax seal.

The modified Dragon capsules they show in their artist illustrations are not big enough to hold Mars surface equipment *and* live in for 8 months *and* store food for 8 months.  So there must be some other service module/habitat or something to use while getting to Mars, but we have not seen a picture.
Aside from parts of the project that are entirely missing from their description, for the parts they do show - the capsules on the Martian surface, we have no data about mass, volume, power output, or any other actual data about the design.  So people like me, who helped build the Space Station and know a bit about long term occupancy in space, can't check to see if their plans make sense.
Aside from the lack of technical data to examine, the kind of people you want for a reality show are the exact opposite of the kind you want for a space mission.

According to the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, the M1 has a typical velocity of 7/year:
The definition of M1 is currency in circulation plus "demand deposits" (checking and similar accounts, that can be spent immediately).  This seems to be the most similar to the bitcoin supply, since all of it can be spent almost immediately.
The bitcoin transaction volume is estimated at 300K/day ( which implies a velocity of 10.  So it seems the velocity is not that different between dollars and bitcoin.
There are complications to this simple analysis.  For example, I keep a monthly minimum of $300 or so in my checking account as a buffer for unexpected bills, and a little cash in my physical wallet just in case.  These almost never get spent, so their velocity is near zero.  They are not really savings, just buffers so I don't end up with a zero balance.  Other people keep some reserves in a savings account for similar situations.  These are not investment savings so much as covering month-to-month fluctuations.

The transaction protocol isn't the only important feature of Bitcoin.  It also includes a secure distributed record-keeping system (the Block Chain) that uses chained hashes to timestamp data and validate it has not been changed.
We happen to use the record-keeping system to record currency transactions.  In general, though, it can record any kind of data whatsoever.  Examples include property ownership, stock transactions, contracts, and proof of intellectual property.  You can even record proof of secret data, such as trade secrets or contracts you don't want to make public.  You do this by making a hash of the data and including that in a block chain system.  Later you can prove the data is unchanged or existed at a particular time by hashing it again.
A secure public records system should probably use a separate block chain from the one Bitcoin uses, to allow for larger data blocks and slower entry rates (people don't buy houses or sign contracts as often as they use their checking account), but the general idea of such a system is out there, and I think eventually it will have a large impact.

It's the product of number of coins transacted and their "age" (days since last transaction).  Since the age is reset to 0 for the coins just moved, it "destroys" their past aging.  It's a confusing term, there is probably a better way to describe it.
What you can do with this metric is sum it over a month (to remove daily fluctuations) and divide by total transaction volume, and get an "average holding time".  Alternately you could make a graph or table by age of coins spent - how many are under 30 days, 30-60 days, etc.  That would give you an idea of spending and saving patterns - how many coins are in current circulation vs being held for long periods.

My hobby for about 30 years was medieval re-enactment ( and I have hundreds of books on the subject.  I can confidently say you are entirely incorrect in this opinion.
* The so-called "dark ages" were named from a lack of written sources in languages and locations the Renaissance writers could access.  From a modern standpoint they are not dark at all.
* The typical medieval serf owed 30-40% of their labor and produce to the manor.  The manorial lord in turn owed part of his income to his liege, up to the king or the church (whoever was the ultimate owner).  Feudal dues were just as un-optional as modern taxes.
* The causes of the post-Roman decline are complex, but are usually laid on rigidity of the later Empire's social and economic structure, negative population growth of cities, and recurrent plagues.  Opportunistic nationalities moved in to replace the Romans, but because they were not good record-keepers, we had a "dark" period.  It was not a lack of leaders, it was a lack of librarians.

I used to be part owner of an "escort club" in the Second Life virtual world.  Depending on the escort, they offered avatar sex, voice chat, photos, videos, and live webcam.  A few even tried to offer live sex (ie prostitution), but we had to remove those.
Many of the women doing this were amateurs making a few dollars on the side, but the small percentage of serious entertainers advertised/worked at multiple venues.  For them, Second Life was just another way to find customers.  Based on my experience, I would expect the same to be true of Girls Gone Bitcoin.  Most will be amateurs making a little bit here and there, and a few will be serious entertainers advertising in many places.
(For those wondering why would anyone pay for avatar sex, the visuals are just a mental prop.  The real attraction is interacting with a live person who is willing to play to your sexual fantasies.)

I disagree.  Western Union already runs foreign exchange in multiple currencies, as the link I provided shows.  So they already have the infrastructure in place to deal with it.  For them, it's a matter of adding bitcoin to the other 135 currencies they deal in, and then a back-end to do the send and receive on the bitcoin network.
I would assume since they already run a currency network, they have people who understand how to set up such things.  So it would not be hard **for them**.  It would be hard for you and me, without the experience, but sending money electronically is their core business.

Pavebots can't multiply, they are end-point specialized machines.  Instead you should be asking what happens when the self-expanding factory starts multiplying, because that is what it is designed to do.
The answers are (1) "replication time", how long it takes a factory to copy itself.  My estimate is three years.  Thus uncontrolled self-replication is slow enough to blow up the rogue factories. (2) Even a factory designed for self-expansion will require specialty parts and materials it cannot make itself.   Thus things like computer chips or rare earth elements would need to be supplied from outside, and to stop the rogue factory you simply withhold them.

I see the main bitcoin block chain evolving into inter-pool settlements, with separate block chains operated locally among users who mostly trade amongst themselves.  The pools would gather up smaller transactions and turn them into single larger ones on the main block chain.  It's kind of like applying parallel processing to a computational problem.
What will drive the formation of side chains and pools is the finite block size for the main block chain.  It has a hard limit of 1 MB/block.  This limits the number of possible transactions per hour.  Since miners are driven to collect transaction fees, they will tend to prefer processing the ones with the larger fees, leaving smaller transactions behind.  Aggregating transactions into pools is a natural response to that.

The common error even economists make is conflating the Bitcoin Network and the transactions carried on the network.  The Bitcoin Network consists of software, hardware nodes that run the software, websites and apps, and a big database.  Those pieces are not too different than other Internet applications.  They have "utility value" in and of themselves because they perform a useful function - that of transferring monetary value.  They don't need backing any more than UPS's network of trucks and terminals needs backing.
The value of the packages that UPS delivers is not directly tied to the value of their distribution network.  In a similar way, the monetary value that the Bitcoin Network transmits isn't tied to the utility value of the network itself.  It's tied to the value of goods and services being paid for through the network.  The total number of accounting units tracked in the database is finite.  So as the volume of goods and services being traded goes up, so will the value of an accounting unit.  Since 1.00 accounting units is referred to as "a bitcoin", this leads to confusion between the network and the database units.  One is a physical entity comprised of hardware, software, and database files.  The other is a unit of measure for the size of an address balance, and is no more physical than "a meter" or "a Watt".

For humor's sake, I'm going to get into the business of "collectible antique data entries".

@_date: 2013-08-29 14:53:09
Yes, because bitcoins are never "sent" anywhere.  Transactions between bitcoin addresses are recorded on the Block Chain, and the balance for a given address is simply the sum of all transactions going in and out so far.
We call 1.00000000 units in the Block Chain "a bitcoin", but it is merely a unit of measure.  The balances and transactions never leave the Block Chain once they get there.
So the only thing you need to do is deliver a properly signed transaction to the network with the sending address having enough balance to make the transaction.  Eventually a miner picks up that transaction and adds it to a block, and it becomes a permanent addition to the Chain.
At worst a transaction does not make it through to the network.  Full bitcoin clients (the program you run on your own PC) typically make multiple connections to the network.  So a single malicious party on the network doesn't stop the transaction.  Also, generally you don't connect directly to the receiving party.  You post your transaction to the network, and they pick it up later after it has propagated across multiple nodes (on average around 3 or 4 hops).
@_date: 2013-11-26 02:43:43


I'm not an expert on the innards of the block chain, but I think the software keeps all the blocks, including forked chains (where two new blocks are based on the same previous one).  Eventually one branch dies out, because miners jump on the one that appears to be longest/first arriving.  If they stay on the wrong chain, their block reward becomes invalid because nobody else will follow that branch later.  In the case that two people generate a valid block at almost the same time, you now have competing branches.  Since the time to find the next block after it is random, odds are one side of the fork will add a block minutes before the other, and thus become the clear "longest".  At that point all the miners will build on that one and abandon the other one.






Yes, it's a peer-to-peer network like bittorrent.  When you start up BitcoinQt (the official client program) it contacts other nodes on the network and starts downloading blocks from them, until you catch up.  Since the block chain is so large now, there is an actual torrent with a bootstrap file that gives you most of the data:  (warning: 9 GB)  Once you are caught up, you then get new individual transactions and full blocks from your peers on the network.


The first time, all of them, it's the only way to be sure.   On my relatively fast desktop that takes about an hour.  After that the client program can checkpoint the data and only needs to check new blocks and transactions.
 




The block chain is currently 13.4 GB, which at the price of my last hard drive purchase (a year ago) is about the price of a postage stamp.  So it's not too big yet, but it's growing.  Pruning entire blocks, or the "merkle tree" within a block from which the hash is generated, means removing parts where all the balances from an address has been spent, i.e they are empty.  You don't have to worry about zero balance addresses for the purpose of preventing "double spending" (spending bitcoins twice).  You can just assume any address that has been pruned has no money, and so any attempt to spend from them is automatically invalid.
The way you keep from having a security problem is you first download *all* the unpruned block data, validate it yourself, then prune the unnecessary parts.  That requires at least some people to have a full copy.  Another way to hold down the size of what's stored on your PC is to make it a torrent-like thing, where each person holds and shares a portion of the entire block chain, and only accesses the other parts as needed.  The original paper didn't contemplate that method, and others may be thought up over time.  Eventually we may migrate to subscription servers, where some number of people split the cost of hosting a full block chain.  It eats up 2% of my C:/ drive at the moment, so it's not too bad, but I don't want it eating my whole drive.  Moving it to a dedicated server would be preferable.

They may be doing it indirectly.  The number of Treasury staff involved in drafting bitcoin rules is probably not large.  If the Bitcoin Foundation keeps them busy by filing responses, objecting to proposed regulations, even filing suit against the process (the way environmentalists do), they can gum up and slow down the issuing of regulations.
In the mean time, the bitcoin ecosystem can grow unchecked, and by the time the regulations are finally implemented, they could be obsolete and unenforceable.  In that circumstance, the details of whatever regulations are written are not as important as that they take a long time to finish.
Another way to delay stuff is to argue that one or more other agencies are responsible for the rule-making.  Jurisdictional food fights or having to convene inter-agency meetings are another delaying tactic.

I could set up a fund that holds SPDR Gold Shares (  ), which is a big pile of gold in a vault.  When you want to buy something with it, it gets converted to bitcoin, which is easier to make electronic payments with.  That would be a lot more practical than a card you tear up to spend.
If it wasn't so complex legally, I'd be setting up such "asset-backed spending accounts".  You hold whatever mix of assets you choose as "backing" - gold, real estate, stocks and bonds, dollars.  Then bitcoins are just the deposit and spending channel to get around brokerage fees.  
The assets would be held in a pooled account, so that individual decisions to deposit, withdraw, or shift asset mix get averaged out, and you only have to make real world purchases or sales on the net totals.

You cannot keep a coherent block chain when the light travel time &gt; block generation time, which is roughly the distance from the Sun to Earth.  It would allow double-spending because of the time lag.
You would need to run a separate block chain on, say Mars, and have exchanges that convert transactions from the local block chain to the Earth one, with enough time delay built-in to receive confirmations.  The Moon is close enough (1280 milliseconds) to participate in the Earth block chain, and out to the Earth-Sun L1 and L2 points  (5 light seconds).
Anything beyond that would need to use a Solar System-wide block chain with a slower block interval (~10 hours/block), or local ones with exchanges that convert between them.

An address is more like a checking account number, in the sense of it holds a balance of some number of bitcoins (including fractions of a coin).  The current balance is simply the sum of all ingoing and outgoing transactions recorded in the block chain history from that account.
The block chain is simply every bitcoin transaction ever made by everyone, grouped into blocks of transactions, and the blocks chained together by including the hash of the previous block as part of the next block.  You can verify any given block by hashing it and comparing it to the value in the next block.  This locks together the entire transaction history so there is no way to tamper with past entries.  If you change any single transaction, you would also have to change every block after it up to the present, which is basically impossible.

I see it as waves of new people discovering bitcoin.  The bump in mid-2011 was when geeks discovered it.  The one early this year was when people in shaky Euro countries discovered it.  This latest bump is when people in China discovered it.
Each wave gets overexcited because of media hype.  But the hype leaves behind a core of new users, apps, merchants, etc.  So after the frenzy, the price retreats, but levels out at a higher level.
My guess is the next wave is when Wall Street discovers it.  The angel investors and venture funds have been putting in their money to bitcoin start-ups.  Brokers have been starting to poke around with bitcoin for their own accounts, and now we are seeing the first market analysts putting out opinions.  
Sometime down the road, perhaps 6 months or a year, we will start to see bitcoin success stories, or a market shock (end of the Fed's QE program?) will send people scurrying for alternatives.  I can't predict what the stories will be, but the media will once again whip up a frenzy, investors will ask their brokers how to get into this "bitcoin thing", and we'll see another run up.

US fractional currency works that way.  Dime, cent, and mill mean 1/10th, 1/100th, and 1/1000th of a dollar, from the Latin.  Mill never caught on as a coin, because it was too small, but "millage rate" is still used in property taxation.  It means thousandths of the assessed value.
So I think in terms of "millicoins" and "microcoins" (mils and mics), with $1 US = ~ 5 mils currently, or 1 mil = $0.20 US.

There are other cryptocurrencies already in existence.  If for some reason there are not enough bitcoins (which is actually not a problem), you can just power up an alternative with more coins.
In practice, there are 63 "Satoshi", the smallest current fraction of a bitcoin, for every dollar in value of all the world's currencies combined.  Even if you lose a lot of them, there are enough for any practical purpose.
100 million Satoshi = 1 bitcoin, in the same way as 100 cents = 1 US dollar, just more decimal places.  Also, 1,000 millicoins = 1 million microcoins = 1 bitcoin.  We will likely use the intermediate sizes for a while, now that 1 BTC = 7 Benjamins ($100 dollar bills)

That's obviously true for early forms of money like cattle and copper (which was used for tools before it was traded as coins).  Today we understand the usefulness of intangibles like software, transaction protocols, secure databases, and networks, all of which Bitcoin uses.  People could not predict how successful the combination that went into Bitcoin would become, but based on the usefulness in general of software, etc they could give it *some* non-zero value.  That gives a starting point for valuing block chain balances.
Effectively they were estimating (value of bitcoin as a mature network) x (probability it will become successful), which was small at first.  As it has been put into actual use, the probability of success has gone up, and so has the value estimate.  So rather than a pre-existing commodity that gets turned into money, I think the value of Bitcoin depends on the network effect - the more people that use a network, the more value it has.  The Internet as a whole, or the telephone network before it, or Ebay as a marketplace are examples of such.

The same rules would apply as for any other business income or capital gains.  They don't make new rules for every new idea that comes along.
If you create something and then sell it, it's a business.  You get to deduct legitimate expenses, which for bitcoin mining would be hardware, internet connection, and electricity.  If you pay a fee at an exchange to sell the coins, that counts too.  Whatever is left over is profit, which you report on Schedule C (
I've been doing this since 2006 for my Second Life Linden Dollar income, and the IRS has been happy with it.
If you buy bitcoins and then later sell them at a different price, that can create a capital gain or loss.  It doesn't matter if you sell them for dollars, or use them to buy a Tesla Roadster.  The value at the time of the sale in dollars is what counts, minus whatever the original cost was.
The morality of taxation in general, and methods of avoiding the IRS knowing you have income are different subjects.  You asked how the IRS would treat income from bitcoins, and the answer is just like they treat income from everything else.  The income categories have been around for a long time, and it doesn't matter if you used dollars, chickens, or bitcoins to generate the income.

I don't think your version of the analogy works.  With UPS, the packages themselves are delivered unchanged.  With the Bitcoin network, you exchange some goods or services (usually a local currency) for a network address balance.  Then you transmit that balance to another address.  The merchant at the other end usually exchanges their balance back to local currency.  So value is delivered from one place to another, but it changes form on the way.  
The similarity is that both UPS and bitcoin deliver things from place to place, and the value of what they deliver is separate from the value of the delivery system.  But the mechanisms are different enough that I don't think pushing the analogy further makes sense.  Satoshi are not labels you attach to value being sent, they are themselves the value by virtue of being a scarce commodity.  Transaction ID's are the shipping label, and they are not re-used.

"The Block Chain" is the distributed history of every bitcoin transaction ever.  A block is simply a set of transactions verified by a hash value (checksum) to make sure the contents of the transactions have not been altered.
 is a website where you can view the Block Chain, and they also provide an online wallet service.  Any online service has the potential to be hacked, so for significant amounts, it's safer to store the wallet (containing the secret keys that allow you to spend your coins) locally, preferably encrypted and offline.  You can do that by installing a bitcoin client program on your PC.  
An online wallet saves you from having to install software, and makes it possible to spend in a mobile fashion.  But just like you would not want to carry all your valuables around in a physical wallet, you don't want to keep all your bitcoins in an online/accessible wallet.
The really big holders of bitcoin print out a paper wallet, or put the wallet file on a USB key, and then put the paper or USB key in a literal bank vault.  You can also set it up to require several keys from different people before you can spend the coins.  That's extreme levels of security.  The main idea is to use a suitable level of security for the value of what you are storing.

This is called blaming the tool, instead of the criminal.  It is only legitimate when the tool has few other uses.  For example, locksmiths use lock picking tools, but few other people have a legitimate use for them.  Cameras, bricks, and paper money are mostly used for legitimate purposes, thus should not be blamed when a few people use them illegitimately.

My experience in aerospace is that writers for mainstream media will generally screw up anything outside their area of competence, which is the media itself and the "fame business" (politics, movie stars, etc.).  Civilization is complicated, and no single person can understand all of it.  A good journalist will talk to experts and take the time to learn what they are writing about, then put it in terms their audience can understand.  Unfortunately with around-the-clock TV news and the Internet delivering news instantly, there simply isn't time to do that.
Writers working for a trade publication, however, tend to get things right about their own industry.  They have to, because their audience are specialists in that topic.  Thus, Wall Street Journal articles about business and finance are liable to be correct on the technical aspects.  For example, they will likely not confuse a common stock for a corporate bond.  Similarly, Aviation Week, a trade publication in the aerospace business, is generally correct about things within our industry.
Besides having to be right because their audience will not stand for mistakes, trade journalists have better contacts within their field when they have questions.  The typical "bubble headed bleach blonde"*  reading the teleprompter on CNN won't have those contacts.

Sure it does, it's a share of the total balances on the block chain account book, which amounts to slightly more than 11 million total shares (bitcoins) in total.  Those shares are worth something because of the technical features that make the account book highly reliable and transactions easy to make.  Therefore people are willing to trade real goods and services for some "shares" of bitcoin, in the expectation they can sell those "shares" later for something else.
The value of bitcoins, outside of speculation, is then driven by two things.  The first is the total volume of goods and services being traded for it.  The second is the holding time on average that people keep their bitcoin balance.  For example, if they hold for an average of 0.1 years before trading it away for something else, the aggregate demand to hold bitcoins is one tenth of the annual volume traded for it.

Idea for Sean:
Get the least expensive used "camp trailer with folding walls" (tax class 62 from  ) you can find, with title and a current plate for it.  Mount hinged plywood sheets to it, and portable treated lumber supports to place under them and keep them level and off the ground.  This expands their usable floor area by several times that of the pop-up camper itself.  Now extend a waterproof "awning" from the camper over the plywood floor, and place tents under it.  This should give several people a dry place to stay.
If some cop or housing busybody asks, you can show them the tag and title, and that it all folds up and fits back in the original camper.  If they ban your use, you would have to ban all the commercial pop up and expandable camper trailers other people use, which as a tourist area I would imagine they can't do.

There are various arguments that can be made that miners don't "create" bitcoins:
* It can be said that all 21 million bitcoins were created by Satoshi Nakamoto when he wrote the coin generation rules.  Miners only claim them from the available pool of unclaimed coins.
* It can also be said that miners by their sole action don't add the block to the block chain, thus adding to their own balance.  The block has to be accepted by the network, and then another 120 blocks generated afterwards before the coins can be used.  Thus mined coins are a collective act of the whole network by adding them to everyone's copy of the block chain.
* One can also say individual miners in a pool don't create anything.  We are independent contractors who calculate hashes for the pool operator.  We usually get paid in bitcoins, but we could easily get paid in local currency.  We do work, we get paid, that's different from creating stuff.
It's 4am, and I recognize these arguments can be mutually inconsistent, or just flat out wrong, but I wanted to put them out there to counter the FinCen hysteria.  I see what the Treasury is doing is a power grab.  Regulators want more stuff to regulate, to keep themselves employed.  Thus they widen the definition of what falls under their rules.  I only somewhat tongue-in-cheek expect them to define wholesale distributors as "money transmitters", since they exchange money for goods, ship them to customers, and then exchange the goods for money again.

The way I think of it, the block chain is a very secure record-keeping system that keeps track of balances associated with account numbers/addresses.  That security allows people to use it as a trade intermediary.  By intermediary, I mean people are willing to trade something now for a balance on the block chain, in the expectation that balance will still be there later, and can be traded for something else.
Since balances, which are measured in units we call bitcoins, are scarce and issued at a known rate, people additionally are confident their balance will retain it's proportional share of all the balances on the block chain.  Since the total of goods and services offered in exchange for these balances (including other currencies) and the volume of balances offered in trade, sets their price by supply and demand, it's important not to inflate the quantity of balances.
The combination of secure storage and scarcity thus makes bitcoin balances a good store of value in the monetary sense.  The functions of money then grow out of that store of value.

I think that is the important idea.  That non-government money is possible.  Imagine turning shares of an Exchange Traded Fund like  into a currency, or fractional ownership in real estate.  Now imagine further that each person can specify a personal basket of currencies, assigning what percentage of each goes into the basket.  The payment network would transparently convert from your basket to someone else's, so that each person has their money backed by what they prefer.  
That is quite a different concept than government issued currency where only the government gets to decide what the backing is (if there even is any).

The inverse of the turn over rate is the average holding time.  Thus a turn over of 5 equates to 73 days.  That's an *average*.  It includes people saving for the long term, people buying from Coinbase just before getting a gift card, and everything in between.  
A remittance would be a short term hold, probably on the order of a few days if you allow for time zones and getting to an exchange shop at the destination.  That is balanced by Satoshi's holdings *which have never moved*, and bring up the average quite a bit:
1800 days x 5% of all bitcoins = 90 day contribution to average holding time.  My 73 day figure assumes Satoshi at some point in the future moves his coins.  At the moment he's our "Fort Knox", a big pile of coins in long term storage.

Since the number of bitcoins is slowly growing (12% a year right now), if bitcoin explodes into the market, the price of each coin will go up (basic supply and demand).
Miners get a reward for solving blocks, currently 25 newly minted coins/block.  At today's price, the reward is worth $750, about every 10 minutes, for the first miner to solve the block.  If the price is higher, so is the incentive to solve blocks, thus more miners.
"Solving a block" technically is finding a number, called a "nonce", which when included with a set of transactions, and the hash of the previous block, yields a new hash value below a threshold (lots of leading zeroes).  It takes about 17 quadrillion tries to solve a block these days, by trying different nonces and seeing if they result in a low hash value.  It only takes one hash to verify the block is valid.
If anyone wants to insert a fake transaction, they would have to solve a block faster than the whole rest of the network.  The difficulty of doing this means you are pretty sure blocks of transactions are valid (individual transactions are also cryptographically signed, so only the owner of the account can generate them).  Since each block includes the hash of the previous block as part of it, they form a chain going back to the very first bitcoin transaction ever made.  So the entire history is a permanent record, which anyone can check.
Thus, the work that miners do is not idle number crunching for it's own sake.  It is securing the history of transactions against tampering.  This is a necessary function for any financial system.  The reward of new coins is effectively the collective bitcoin network paying for this necessary function.
In addition to the reward, people can also include fees in their transaction, as an incentive for miners to process their transaction faster.  Miners get these fees in addition to the reward.  So if bitcoin explodes, so will the fees, further increasing the incentive for people to get into the mining business.

BTC Guild shows 16,600 miners on just their pool.  Since they are 40% of current network hash rate, we can estimate 41,500 total miners for bitcoin.  We would expect the number of nodes on the network to be larger than than the number of miners, because mining has significant hardware and electricity costs, and for many people it is unprofitable.
Another way to approach it is blockchain.info estimates daily transaction volume at $40 million.  Your estimate of 14k nodes implies $2,850/node/day.  That seems unrealistically high.  With 350,000 nodes, we get $114/node/day, which appears more reasonable.

ETF stands for "Exchange Traded Fund", meaning a fund that trades on a stock exchange like common stock of companies do.  Mutual funds don't all trade on an exchange.  Some of them can only be bought or sold directly from the fund manager.  When they *are* traded on an exchange, you can buy and sell them as easily as any stock, which is pretty easy.
Any fund has to hold some assets to give the fund shares a value.  Stock mutual funds hold share of stock, bond funds hold corporate or government bonds, the SPDR Gold Trust (stock symbol = GLD) holds a lot of gold in an HSBC vault in London ( and the bitcoin fund is going to hold bitcoins.
The fund "Net Asset Value" (NAV) is determined by the combined value of the assets it holds, less any loans it has taken out.  Most funds will trade at close to the NAV.

No, they would tie their prices to a basket of assets that are stores of value, like gold, real estate, etc.  Those remain stable.  How many bitcoin units it takes to make a sale would be calculated in real time.


That's exactly what happens with merchant websites and shop smartphone/tablet apps today.  The software determines a bitcoin price based on their merchant processor (ie BitPay or Coinbase) rate at the time of the sale.  The only change is instead of using dollars as the base to calculate from, it would be a basket of stable assets.
For long term purchases, like a house, it makes a lot more sense to price the sale in terms of a real estate-backed pool like the Vanguard REIT Index ( plus an agreed interest rate in the same units.  The bitcoin exchange rate doesn't matter, it's just the transmission medium to get the funds to the lender.

Actually, we do.  There is a hard limit of 1 MB/block.  This limits each block to about 4000 transactions.  As the reward for mining a block decreases by half every 210,000 blocks (about 4 years), miners will have an increasing incentive to include transactions with fees.  The limit on number of transactions will force users to include a reasonable fee to have their transaction processed.  Together these forces will make transaction fees take over as the main source of income for miners.
The other thing the block limit will do is force microtransactions off the main block chain, and turn it into a settlement system for larger pools and transactions.  Our own tip-bot here on Reddit is an example.  You only access the bitcoin block chain when you cash out.  Internally on reddit the tips can flow freely.  
Other accounting and record-keeping networks can use their own internal systems to track transactions and balances.  They would only need to access the main block chain to settle balances across different networks.  One transaction gpes on the main block chain, and a message carrying the details of many smaller transactions goes direct from network to network.  This reduces block chain bloat and can speed up overall delivery time.  Two networks that are used to working with each other can maintain balances on each other's systems.  If such balances cover, say a day's worth of settlements, they can forward payments to users immediately on getting the details, and can wait an hour for the block chain to confirm it 6 times, because there is sufficient buffer in 24 hours worth of balance.

Yes, all value is subjective, I was just explaining the route through which bitcoin is valued.
Any time someone mentions "intrinsic value", tell them that's nonsense.  If I want to buy a hamburger, it because I am hungry, and I value the hamburger more than the money in my pocket *at that moment*.  If I was not hungry, the trade would not happen because I don't value the hamburger enough at the offered price.
Thus not only does value differ between people, it differs for one person at different times.  Differing valuations are what enable trade, because each party in the trade thinks what the other has is worth more than what they are trading away.

Not necessarily.  The bitcoin block chain limits transaction volume.  You can start up parallel or branching block chains with the same kind of mining and block rules to increase volume and maintain the same level of trust.
Parallel is systems like litecoin and namecoin, or an outright copy of bitcoin (Bitcoin B), which are not directly connected to the main block chain, but use the same kind of software.  Transactions between parallel systems would be a currency exchange, the way bitcoin to fiat transactions are.
Branching would be a system that passes some transactions on the main block chain, but keeps others off it (like small ones), and internally uses a block chain to build trust.

The commodities are the goods and services that people are willing to trade with each other.  The block chain is just where we write down the trades.  It doesn't have more intrinsic value than an accounting spreadsheet, except that you can verify it has not been tampered with.  That gives people confidence to take an accounting token (bitcoin) now in the expectation they can trade that token later for something else.
Without a trading network of real goods and services, bitcoins are worthless tokens.  The more people use it in trade, the higher the value.

The comment I posted on the article:
"Therefore its value rests on perception – what people think it is worth." - John Authers
This is incorrect. The value rest on the *utility* of the Bitcoin network in performing a useful service - that of moving money from one person to another. To the extent the network can perform this service better than the alternatives, people will assign it value.
In order to use the network, you need a balance on the distributed account ledger (the Block Chain). Since the total amount of balances is finite, as demand to use the network goes up, so will the exchange rate for balances in terms of other currencies. What people call "a bitcoin" is merely a unit of measure for Block Chain balances, like meters are a unit of measure for length. The "coins" have no separate existence outside the account ledger, and the ledger has no usefulness without the rest of the network.
If you want an analogy, a traditional paper accounting book has no value in itself, without an accountant to make entries, and the entries made also have no value in themselves as ink on paper. But if that accounting book is used to record valuable transactions, then it becomes of value through use, and the accountant finds employment. The Block Chain is the account book, and the Bitcoin Network are the accountants here.

Yes, it's a well known phenomenon known as the "hype cycle" ( an example of positive feedback.  Some triggering event causes media reporting.

By the same logic, since bank robbers use getaway cars and roads, we should ban cars and roads.

If it does, it is unfair to punish the tool for what a few people do with it.

I'm toying with the idea of "user-defined currency backing", where you get to pick if your money is backed by gold, real estate, bitcoins, or whatever.  Other people can pick different backing according to their own choices.  Then when two of these users make a transaction, the back-end does the conversion automatically, and buys or sells sufficient assets to maintain the aggregate of everyone's backing.
The nearest present-day equivalent would be a stock brokerage account, where the percentage of your chosen investments is maintained automatically, with a linked debit card/checking account that draws on those investments as needed, but without you needing to do individual buy and sell orders, and without brokerage commissions.  All that gets handled in the background for you.
I consider the idea that a currency is only backed by one set of assets (or none at all) by government fiat is anachronistic and monopolistic.  People should be able to choose what their money is made of.

Well, aside from the practical difficulties that no existing government would voluntarily give up their power, I would consider it an upgrade.
One approach is subscriber-based legal systems, rather than territory-based legal systems.  You belong to a particular legal system because you choose it, not because of the accident of which piece of land you are on.  This would require neutral arbitration when two people subscribe to different systems.  An option would be "no subscription", or to give it it's ancient name "outlaw".  You do not pay to belong to any particular legal system, but then you also don't get any protection from any of them.  The question is how to prevent the devolution of such a subscriber system into tyranny.
A feature of a subscription system is that everyone doesn't need to subscribe to the same package of services and protection, or to get all the services from one provider.  That would give a higher level of decentralization and competition.

Imagine that someday bitcoin handles 1% of international trade and local purchases.  Given that the world's money supply is US$ 33 trillion, then bitcoins could conceivably be worth $330 billion total, or ~$15,000/coin.
The trading network between people who use bitcoins is the driving force.  You sell your local currency (dollars in my case) in exchange for a balance in the bitcoin database (the block chain).  You do that in the expectation that at some later time, minutes or years later, you can exchange your balance for something you want.  If the database was insecure, or there was nothing worth buying, having a balance would be pointless.
I think the Bitcoin database is much better designed and more secure than my bank's system.  It has lower fees, and often clears transactions faster.  There are more and more people offering goods and services lately, after a somewhat stagnant time for most of 2012.  The ultimate potential is driven by calculations like the one I made above.  It is "how much market share do you think bitcoin can gain in the transactions for value business?".  That business is dominated by banks and national currencies, but that does not mean they will dominate forever.

The promoter of this Ponzi scheme happens to be the US government, otherwise they could not have dragged every worker into it, and had it running for so long.  Some countries actually do invest their national pension funds, but the US system is merely a tax on younger people which transfers the money to older people.  That could work as long as population was growing rapidly, but nowadays it isn't, and people are living a lot longer than in 1933, so the ratio of people paying in to people getting money out is way lower.
The only way out of the mess that I can see is to automate the heck out of society, and "pay" retirees with the surplus goods and services that generates.  It doesn't really matter if the payment is in kind, or in cash.  What matters is there is enough stuff being produced that the young are not paying an unbearable burden to support the old, or conversely the old don't starve.

Assuming that not too many people will mine at a loss, the upper limit on energy use is the value of the block reward + transaction fees in kWh.  Since serious miners also have to pay for hardware, the reduces the fraction of mining income that can be spent on electricity.
In the long run, when block rewards become small, and only transaction fees are left, the energy spent on mining will be determined by the value of those fees.  At present, this amounts to ~55 BTC/day vs ~300,000 BTC estimated transaction volume.  Thus fees are 0.018% of the estimated transaction value.  Energy use in the future will be this amount or less.
Now, how much energy does the traditional banking sector use?  According to this article:  about 100 kWh/branch/year.  There are about 100,000 bank branches in the US (  ), so total energy use would be 10 million kWh/year, or 1141 kW.  That is just the branches, and just in the US.

* As much as required by the mortgage company, who currently require insurance, and hold funds in escrow to cover property taxes and insurance payments.  All you are doing is shifting the cost of fire fighting from the tax line item to the insurance line item.  If you are part of a home-owner's association, they may require paying for fire fighting as part of the association dues.
* Multiple fire departments do not make sense.  There would be one local one.  The insurance company would either pay them directly, or assess your rates based on whether you are signed up with the local fire dept.  They already assess risk based on the type of construction of the house, distance to fire hydrants, and type and distance of local fire department.  Not being signed up with the local fire company just puts you in a higher risk category and you would pay higher rates for coverage.
* Fire companies would presumably be run as non-profits.  Existing volunteer fire departments already do this.  Thus getting bought out could be a non-issue.  Mortgage companies have an interest in keeping their mortgages out of default and maintaining insurance coverage.  If jacking up rates is a problem, they can negotiate a flat rate with the insurance company or take their business elsewhere.  A sufficiently high rate invites new competition or setting up a VFD.
* Fire departments need to respond to *all* fires in their service area, even on empty lots, because fires can spread if not put out.  Also, the kind of people who work as firefighters are not assholes, and will generally respond if lives are at stake, the same as emergency rooms in non-profit hospitals will treat anyone.  To cover costs, they contract with insurance companies to provide service, and the insurance companies pay for it because it reduces the losses they otherwise need to pay out.

Nearly one fifth of the US economy is estimated to be underground:
It can be divided into two parts - "off the books", which is activity that is otherwise legal but unreported.  An example is building contractors who are paid in cash and don't bother to report the income.  The other part is "black market", which is activity that is illegal even if it was reported.  Standard examples would be drugs and prostitution.
Bitcoin happens to be a good tool for underground transactions, But the Forbes article could have been titled "Benjamins ($100 US notes) - Tax Evasion Currency" and been more correct.  Total estimated bitcoin transactions are running around $9 billion/year, reported and unreported, worldwide.  Thus the fraction that is US based and unreported must be less than that.

I just used US data because it was easy to look up.  Bitcoin is inherently international, so you would need to compare it to worldwide money supply, which is in the neighborhood of 25-30 trillion US$ (  ).  That would work out to $1.5 M/coin.  You can use that for an upper bound on the future value.
Narrow money supply is currency + demand deposits, which I consider the most comparable measure.  Total world financial assets are much larger than this.
For comparison, the world's total gold supply of 220,000 tons, counting all gold above ground plus reserves still in mines, times the market price of US$53.4 million/ton, is worth 11.75 trillion US$.

They are a bitcoin "payment processor".  They accept bitcoin payments on behalf of a merchant, using website plugins or other fancy tools.  Then they convert them to local currency, and send it to the merchant's bank account daily.  The merchant doesn't have to deal with the currency conversion, or exchange rate risk.  BitPay probably gets a much better deal on fees at the exchanges because of their larger volume.
This is ideal for merchants who get 99% of their sales the usual way, but want to capture a few bitcoin sales with low overhead.

My "aha" moment was mid-2006, when I discovered Second Life, and their convertible Linden Dollar (L$).  For those not familiar, people sell stuff in that virtual world for L$, which can then be cashed out for US dollars.  It was obvious that the virtual currency should be expanded beyond their one corner of the Internet, but one of the original investors in Second Life was Pierre Omidyar, a founder of ebay.  So Second Life uses PayPal on good terms to cash out L$ earnings, but they missed out on the chance to create a global frictionless currency.  That may turn out to be one of the great missed opportunities in history.
By the time I first heard of Bitcoin (mid-2011, from the price spike), it would be the third "virtual currency" I got involved with, and the first not tied to a virtual world.  I know virtual currency isn't a good term for it, but that is what people were calling such things at the time.  I immediately knew it would be big, and set about mining, and then buying BTC with L$ when mining got hard.
So I really didn't have an "aha" about bitcoin itself, I was already primed for such a thing, and just waiting for someone to invent it.

Last time I checked, there are theoretically 63 Satoshi for every dollar worth of all the world's currencies combined.  That should be plenty, even if a significant percentage are lost.
I take it you have heard of altcoins (at least 63 of them last time I checked).  If for some reason bitcoin doesn't have enough granularity, we could start up a "bitcoin2", with exactly the same features, except a new block chain.  It would not take much work to have the user software track both block chains.
In effect, all the altcoins do this, just with slightly different features and a new name.  They will not be 1:1 convertible like an exact copy of bitcoin would be, but they still expand the  pool of coins to be used.

Actually, I think self-replicating automated factories (which I am working on) will help with that.  If you own a personal factory (or part of one) which supplies you with the physical goods you need, you don't need a conventional job to live.  No job, no income taxes to collect.  Then you can trade for the things your own factory doesn't make using bitcoin.
Factories which can make copies of themselves will be incredibly cheap, so once developed, everyone can have them.

The original definition of the dollar, in 1792, was a coin containing 24.057 grams of pure silver, plus 12% base alloy.  So it was in fact a unit of measure, but of weight of silver.  Nowadays most dollars only exist as units in electronic transactions and account balances.  So I agree there are similarities.
I think the difference lies in a paper dollar (federal reserve note) being spendable without reference to an account number or key, while a Casascious coin *is* a key, and it's value depends on the amount loaded in the corresponding address.  Thus it is not independent of the block chain, even though it has physical form.

There is no analysis that shows their GVCS set of 50 machines are the right machines, what size you need, what order to build them, or how they integrate into a coherent system.  If there is such an analysis, please point me to it, because I could not find it.

Right now the block chain isn't too big to download, but once that happens, a public library or other source could let you borrow a hard drive with a recent version to copy over, or people could chip in to pay for a server in a data center.  The server would be dedicated to hosting the block chain and keeping it up-to-date.  Helping pay for it is the easiest thing in the world with bitcoin, I'm sure a hosting company can set up the server and payments.
We can also prune the block chain of all the "spent" addresses - the one's with zero balance.  That would chop it down by quite a bit.  Another way to cut down the block chain growth is to move transactions "off chain".  There are several ways to do that, but for example, a separate coin or branch block chain can handle local transactions internally, and bundle up ones going elsewhere as single transactions across the bitcoin main chain.
It's currently growing at ~ 1 GB/month, and I would say 100 GB is about where it gets unreasonably large - so that gives us about 7 years to work on the problem.

For convenience store purchases, the amounts are small enough for the merchant to just take the risk on a zero-confirmation transaction.
For larger purchases - clothing or weekly food buying, a reputable escrow would be useful.  You pre-fund the escrow balance, and they guarantee payment to merchants.

Factories will not become obsolete, they will just become integrated and local, and include 3D printers as well as other devices.  A 3D printer can't make the spools of plastic filament it uses or the metal parts of the printer.  
A Seed Factory includes enough different machines in the starter set to make most of each other's parts, plus produce useful products.  Instead of a static design, the seed grows like a biological plant into a mature production capacity, by making parts for new machines and larger machines, as well as copying it's parts.

If you are prone to conspiracy theories, in Japanese, the family name is written first.  Check out the first letters in this name:
Nakamoto SAtoshi
Nakamoto means "central region" and Satoshi means "clear-thinking; quick-witted; wise".  Thus you can interpret the name as meaning Central Intelligence.  So either (a) the author(s) of the bitcoin software worked for spook agencies, (b) they were poking fun at the spook agencies, or (c) it's just a coincidence.  Take your pick.
My personal opinion is (a), partly from the circumstances of bitcoin's authorship and timing of when Satoshi vanished, and partly from the fact that what the NSA *does* is traffic analysis and data correlation, and the block chain is a perfect source of data for that kind of work.  
The original WSJ story above should not surprise anyone.  Correlating phone, credit card, email, and other data is how the NSA identifies "interesting targets" for further investigation.  If you get a text message from a pro-islamic part of Egypt AND that phone was present at a cell tower where an internet cafe is located AND at the same time the cafe's internet accessed certain websites, you might be selected as an "interesting person".

I have been using CampBX to buy some bitcoins each month, but with increasing delays.  In the hopes it helps other people considering their service, or others can add more information to mine, here is my story and what I found out about them:
I figured out that paper checks was the cheapest way to send them funds in my situation (the only fee is a stamp), so I duly did the KYC verification when I opened the account, and the first couple of deposits were fine.  The last couple of months the crediting to my account has taken longer and longer.  Their FAQ for personal checks (  ) states "The amount is available in your CampBX account three business days after the deposit clears".  The actual history for my latest deposit is I wrote and mailed the check on Sep 20th.  The check is stamped on the back with a processing date of the 27th.  So far so good, a few days for the mail to arrive, then a few more to deposit it, and process.  My bank shows it cleared the 30th, which is only one business day later, pretty good, but I think they scanned the physical check and did electronic clearing after that.
According to their FAQ my funds should have been available  on the 3rd.  Legally checks can be returned by the issuing bank up to 5 business days after being processed, which would have been the 4th.  On the 7th I opened a support ticket giving the situation and asking if there was a problem with my deposit.  As of right now there has been no response.  My deposit finally appeared at noon EST today.  I don't know if they finally got around to it, or my attempts to reach them prompted action, but the 3 days in the FAQ were actually 10 business days.
I was trying to find their phone number today, in order to ask a real human about my deposit.  First, there is no number listed on the website.  The number for Bulbul Investments LLC (their registered business name) listed on  (510-545-3987) never picks up.  I have tried multiple times since this morning.  I left a message the first time.  Needless to say they have not called back.  There is not even a name programmed into the voice mail.  It goes "[blank] is not available - please leave a message..."
I attempted to find another contact number by googling the address, and trying to find the building manager.  It turns out building 1 suite 600, the address they use at 13010 Morris Road, Alpharetta, GA 30004 is not their office at all, and the photo of the building on the website is misleading.  It's actually a "virtual office space" that recieves mail for them (  ).  We can discuss later if showing the photo of the building is deceptive advertising practice, because they don't actually have a physical office there.
The lady at that Regus office told me that Keyur Mithawala is the name associated with that business, but usually his sister Briyam actually picks up the mail.  So where is the mail actually going?  So I looked up the company filings with Georgia's Secretary of State:  .  On the plus side, they are registered.  But the address given for them is 23109 Deer Trail, Alpharetta, GA 30004, which Google Maps tells me is about 1/4 mile from their other address, in the Preserve at Deerfield apartment complex (  ).  
The apartment complex would not confirm he lives there, but I conclude from my research that CampBX is actually a one person operation run from his apartment as a part time business, with help from his sister.  If it were full time, he would have a working daytime phone, or at least return calls promptly.  The mailing address is an impressive sham.  Their total number of users (as reported on their website) has grown since summer from 20K to 33K, probably because of Mt Gox's US bank and registration problems.  Their trading site works fine, once my money shows up, I immediately was able to buy some coins.  The site is probably fully automated.  Where CampBX seems to be having problems is customer service, likely because they are overwhelmed with accounts, and thus customer contacts.  When there are delays or errors processing payments that only compounds the CS backlog.
My conclusion is they are attempting to run an honest service.  Even if their address is somewhat fake, they appear to be properly registered with Georgia.  But they have been unprepared for growth and are now backlogged.  Where I would mark them down is for not notifying people via their Facebook account, forum postings, or direct customer replies that they are backlogged, and continuing to claim 3 day posting to your account on the website.  I hope these problems get corrected, because all I really want to do is buy bitcoins each month without problems.

Voting is an ancient solution to reaching consensus, on the theory that a majority can force everyone to obey it's decisions, and that a monopoly on decision making is legitimate.
I don't see using force to make people who disagree obey as legitimate.  Therefore updating the mechanics of how you force people to obey isn't an honorable use of people's skills.
How about developing a new approach?  People choose to subscribe to laws they agree with.  Having chosen, they are both protected by them and can be punished if they break them.  An outlaw, in the original sense of the word, chooses not to subscribe to certain laws, but then they can't complain if someone else steals their stuff or kills them, or whatever.
Most people will volunatarily choose to subscribe to a common core legal system, covering stuff like murder, theft, and fraud, because that's how normal societies function.  Where a public record system comes in is for recording who has subscribed to what, and a block chain is nothing more than a public record system.

If you erased every copy of the block chain files, what happens to the bitcoins they track?  You can no longer verify the account history, so they would no longer be spendable.  Therefore their existence is in those files.
What really exists is not individual bitcoins, but a single account book/ledger that tracks account numbers and transactions between them.  Coins are just the units that balances and transactions are measured in.  So the proper way to think of them is as a unit of measure, like a meter or kilogram, rather than a physical entity.  The definition in that case is 1/21,000,000 of the potential total balance recorded in the block chain.  The block chain itself is the "thing that exists", and it most definitely does.  It takes up 6.5 GB of space on my hard drive.

It's not just miners, but every node on the network checks the history of sender accounts as new transactions arrive.  It's not that hard if you have an index, which the current official client does.
Miners do the same work as ordinary nodes as far as verifying transactions, but then attempt to discover block hashes based on a set of new transactions sitting in the "transaction pool" (verified but not yet included in a block).


That is exactly what the block chain is - every single transaction ever made.  The balance for a given account is just the sum of all past transactions.  If you make an index by account number, listing which block number, and which transaction within the block that account was involved with, that only takes about 4 bytes per transaction to index them: 20 bits for block number, 12 bits for transaction within the block = 32 bits = 4 bytes.  Transactions themselves are about 500 bytes.  So if you can store the block chain, you can also store an index.


Nope, you verify new transactions as they arrive, looking up their past transactions from their index.  A bigger block chain doesn't make that harder.  The thing to worry about is "block chain bloat" - the whole block chain getting unreasonably large.  It costs me $0.28 of hard drive space to store the block chain, which is pretty reasonable, but if it grows 1000-fold, it can start to be an issue for everyone to store it.

Sure.  If it's worth more over time, just put some away somewhere. You don't need to do anything else.
If you mean can a bank make loans with bitcoins, and pay their depositors interest, yes, except instead of factoring in inflation into the interest rate, they would factor in deflation into the rate.  The interest rate margin above the rate of inflation/deflation stays the same.
Bitcoin would need to have a relatively stable value for that to work, comparable to major currencies, or to have good hedging.  Otherwise the risk would be too large on the underlying value of the loans.

When I started bitcoin mining two years ago, I looked up the energy cost of running my GPU.  It works out to 1.1 cents an hour.  I keep a log of my mining time (about 3000 hours so far), so I have spend $33 in electricity on mining so far.  If I ever sell my coins, I will count that as an expense.  I already write off my PC and internet for my other work, so I can't charge that twice.

I have a comment on one of his examples of pyramid product to network product:


That isn't the right analogy.  It should be:
Centralized Manufacture -&gt; Distributed Production Network
3D printers are only one type of end-fabricator.  A production network would have nodes that interact with each other, to do more than a single node can by itself.  An example is using a 3D printer to make plastic parts, which then go to a foundry as molds to cast metal parts.  The raw metal parts then go to a machine shop to be finished to a high dimensional accuracy.  The finished metal parts can then be used to build another 3D printer.  Thus while a 3D printer by itself might only be able to do plastic parts, as part of a network it can contribute to making a wider range of items.
Of course, while physical items are going one way in a network, you need payments going in the other direction.  Something like bitcoin is ideal for that, especially when production orders need to be automatically generated through the network.  If someone wants a finished item, that generates orders to the various nodes to make the parts, which then go to an assembler and shipper for delivery, and everyone gets their share of the payments electronically.
I've made some illustrations for Seed Factories book I'm working on that may help understand the process.  The first shows two nodes interacting with each other, and collaborating on building a third, but this can be generalized to any number of nodes:
The second is a diagram of a complete factory.  A distributed node would have some subset of the 8 main operations shown.  The green lines are the forward production flow, and the blue lines show part of the completed elements as finished outputs, and the other part looping back as expansion equipment for the factory itself.  Thus the factory is self-expanding.
The book as a whole (which is about half done) talks about self-expanding systems.  A "Seed Factory" is the starter kit from which the rest of the factory grows, like a biological plant grows from a plant seed.  Having all the parts of the starter kit in one location is convenient, it makes transferring items from one stage of production to the next easier.  But it is not *required*.  With modern communications we can separate the pieces and run it as a distributed production network, as long as the various tasks can be coordinated:
The Seed Factory Project is aimed at developing the hardware and software for such starter kits.  We hope to get a permanent location and start building prototypes next year.  It's an open-source project, and our status can be found at:

Transactions are verified by each node in the BitNet (bitcoin network).  So if it arrives on the store's computer or tablet, they already know you had enough funds to make the payment.  The exception is "double spends", where someone tries to spend the same balance twice.  
Accidental or malicious double-spends are less than 1 in 10,000 transactions, and they are pretty hard to carry out from a smartphone while you are standing there, so it is not much risk for the merchant.  Confirmations are a good idea if the transaction is large value.  For a grocery store, though, who does hundreds a day, having one go bad is less risk than they already take from counterfeit paper money, or fraudulent credit cards.

Considering whether to stop mining based on today's price is short term thinking.  I have an older Nvidia card (GTX 260), and I mine in the background, so I get a pitiful 42 Mhash/s.  But the coins I have accumulated that way, all 2.5 of them, are worth twice the electricity cost, since the price keeps rising.  I just have a longer time horizon than *today*.
I should note that I also buy BTC directly.  The background mining is just because the PC is already on, it's winter and it helps warm the room I'm in, and my out of pocket cost is just the incremental power for the graphics card between idle and full speed.

A couple of ideas I get out of this video:
* Programmable Money - at the very lowest level, a bitcoin transaction is as simple as writing a check.  With checks the sender's account is is pre-printed, and you write in who it's going to and the amount, then sign it.   Similarly, a bitcoin transaction has the sender's account and where it's going (in the form of two addresses), the amount, and a digital signature.  But the banking system that processes the check is not something you can program.  The banks can, but they add new features only very slowly, effectively it's closed source money.
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are programmable.  The developers can add features to the protocol, but other people can write client software with extra features, and being digital, can link bitcoin to other software, or build application layers on top of the basic protocol.  I think that's a very radical shift.
* Beyond Money - The distributed record-keeping technology that underlies Bitcoin has application far beyond monetary transactions.  It's perhaps no coincidence that the "killer app" which took personal computers from hobbyist to serious business use was the spreadsheet.  Visicalc was also a monetary record-keeping tool.  I expect many other uses to emerge for the technology.
As an example from the realm of property, today ownership of real estate is normally transacted in big chunks, like a whole house, because the overhead costs of the transaction are big, and the record-keeping system (deeds in the county courthouse) can't handle microtransactions.  Since most people can't afford a whole house all at once, they are forced to get a mortgage from someplace.
With a more advanced record system, you can divide ownership into smaller fractions, and pay for them incrementally, with the balance being rent to the previous owner for the part you haven't bought yet.  You can cut out banks and other middle-men from the transaction.  When it comes time to move somewhere else, you now get the income flow in the other direction from the next resident.
As an example from the physical world, I am working on networked automated production.  If you have a home 3-D printer, you are limited in the kinds of materials it can handle.  A neighborhood where different people have different computerized machines can handle a more complicated project.  A network and software can distribute the tasks to the various machines, and also send payment with Bitcoin.  Any parts or materials that can't be handled locally can also be automatically ordered from a bigger shop or supplier.  With suitable design, a neighborhood "delivery bot" can trundle around from house to house, taking care of moving items from one machine to another.

When I signed up with them about 4 months ago, they were not backlogged.  My KYC verification took about a day, and my first two paper checks were posted to my account balance promptly.
Deposting a check and crediting the customer's account isn't rocket science.  I should know, I actually am a rocket scientist.  And it worked previously.  So I can only assume they are backlogged, either from too many accounts, or other stuff, like registering for state MTB licenses, is taking up all their time.

There will still be an incentive to mine.  Take a look at the latest block:    Notice the last two lines.  Block reward (new coins) = 25 BTC, Transaction fees = 0.536 BTC.  The fees are included by people making transactions as an incentive to have them included in a block.  Eventually miners will earn just the fees, but if there are lots of transactions, that is enough to keep them working on new blocks.

Yes, for an economics publication, they badly erred here.  Mining (i.e. finding valid blocks to add to the block chain) is a sunk cost once you do it.  Profits or losses, like in any business, do not come from how much you spent on sunk costs.  It comes from your eventual sales, which can be more or less than your cost.
Since the bitcoin price is set by supply and demand, it has nothing to do with how hard you worked.

The Forbes writer refers to the "recent collapse" in bitcoin's value.  It has "collapsed" so hard it is up 50% since the start of April.
Obviously, we had tremendous fluctuation in the price since March 19th, but it was a spike up, followed by a rapid decline, then a bounce back.  Since about April 19th it seems to have settled down at a much higher level than before.

The profitability of mining on any given hardware depends on the ratio of bitcoin price to current difficulty.  At the start of March 2013, the difficulty was 4.37 million and the price was $34/BTC, for a ratio of 7.78.  As of now the difficulty is 12.15 million and the price is $134/BTC, for a ratio of 11.03.  So although the difficulty went up a lot, the price went up even more, so mining became more profitable for everyone, regardless of what hardware they are using.
The mining rewards of 25 BTC/block are not changing the next 3 years, but the value of 25 BTC can change dramatically when measured against other currencies.

M1, or stock of narrow money, is a better comparison:
The one linked to in the post (broad money) includes interest-bearing items like bank CD's and money market funds.  M1 includes physical currency plus "demand deposits" (checking accounts and equivalent) which is closer to how bitcoin functions. Bitcoin can be spent immediately, while CD's tie up the funds for a time, and there are no interest-bearing bitcoin accounts.
On the stock of narrow money, bitcoin outranks 56 nations, and is just above the Bahamas, who use the Bahamian dollar, which is tied at parity to the US dollar.

No, in a decentralized monetary system there are multiple currencies competing for users.  The programmers only can influence the one they write code for, but it's the users who decide which currencies are popular.  Thus the users set monetary policy by voting with their money which one to use.  But nobody acts as "central banking authority" because nobody has the power to force their will on other users in a decentralized system.


Assuming nobody chooses an inflationary cryptocurrency, it would just not happen.  QE was an attempt to bring growth to an economy that didn't need growth, because we built too many houses and other construction in the early 2000's.  Population growth and demolition of old buildings has about used up that surplus, and the economy is getting back to normal in the construction sector, and all the related industries (building materials, brokers, secondary spending by construction workers, etc.)
Now that the economy is getting back on track, the FED needs to unwind the excess money supply without further fucking up the economy or creating inflation.

You can't, but banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System can.  How banks get Federal Reserve Notes (cash) and coin to use in day-to-day operations is by supplying collateral to the Fed, of the types listed.  If they return the cash to the Fed, they get their collateral back.  On average, that doesn't happen, because the economy grows and they need more circulating notes, but it's possible.
You and I don't get cash directly from the Fed, we get it second-hand through a bank.  The contract and promise to pay is between the bank and the Fed.
And I fully understand the drawbacks of central bank issuance of currency, and the multiplier effect of fraction reserve banking.  That is a different problem than stating dollars are "not backed by anything".  That statement would only be true if the collateral held against dollars was worthless.  The collateral may be squishy and insufficient, but the treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities do have a market value.

"What people are willing to pay for it" is the same as "what else you can trade it for", because payment for something in fiat currency is just a trade involving that currency.  Trade is always two way, whether it is barter or a cash purchase.  Each party get something they want in exchange for giving up something else.  When it is one way we call it a gift. 
Consider foreign exchange of the traditional kind.  You are trading dollars for euro, for example.  Just because a currency is used on both sides of the trade does not somehow make it not a trade.  What distinguishes money from other trade goods is general acceptability.  I may not want a fish for my used couch I am selling, but I will take cash.  I do that for the simple reason I can later trade the cash for something else I want.

After block 1,260,000 the reward of new coins will be 0.78125 BTC/block, so yes, it will be fractional coins in about 20 years.  At that point 98.4375% of all the bitcoins that will ever exist will be in circulation, and coin generation after that will not be making much difference to the total supply.
Miners also get transaction fees, which average around 0.34 BTC per block these days.  Assuming the volume of transactions goes up, fees will eventually take over from new coin generation as the main source of income for miners, so they will still have reason to mine.

Well said.  Even Nobel Prize winning economist Krugman makes the mistake of assuming money has to be *both* a medium of exchange and store of value.  That mistake probably comes from the history of money as physical commodities.  You could not separate the two functions, so they became conflated in people's minds.
Bitcoin is an excellent medium of exchange, but it was not designed for long-term store of value, because ultimately it is a glorified accounting book.  Adding transactions to the block chain is an accounting function, and with computers those are cheap and fast.
Long term value comes from things people need or want on a consistent basis - houses, food, entertainment, and in turn the systems and technologies that can provide those things.  If you want stored value, then, buy those kinds of assets with your bitcoins (real estate, factories, piles of commodities).
A lot of people are buying and holding bitcoins to speculate on the future demand in trade.  As long as more merchants and users are adopting bitcoin, that makes sense.  But eventually adoption will saturate, at which point the price will stabilize.  Or a better payment network might be invented, and adoption will fall for bitcoin.  Something that depends on technology not improving in the future isn't a good store of value over long time periods.

Almost everyone new to bitcoin seems to get this wrong.  The Bitnet (bitcoin network) performs a useful service - moving money or value from place to place, quickly and cheaply.  It has value in itself by virtue of the service it performs, just like a delivery truck has value because it can move physical items from place to place.  The network doesn't need backing by anything else.
The only way to use the Bitnet is via balances on the block chain, and those balances (i.e. bitcoin the currency unit) are scarce.  So demand to use the network puts a value on the bitcoin units.  But the units would be useless without the network to transmit, record, and generate them.
By network I mean the whole system that enables bitcoin to function: user software, nodes and miners, the block chain, exchanges, online wallets, etc.

* Anybody can use it.  No bank can decide you are not worthy of having an account because your credit is bad, or simply does not operate in your country, like PayPal.
* It's cheap to use.  Transfer fees are much lower than traditional systems.  Thus you save directly on person-to-person transactions, and merchants can save up to 5% on fees and fraud loss compared to bank cards.  That lower cost for merchants will get passed through to consumers.
* It's fast.  As a test, a charitable donation was sent around the world three times, through 11 hands, in two hours, before arriving at the final charity.  Try that with any other monetary system.
* It's private.  Transactions only have account numbers and amounts.  So you are not exposed to identity theft.  If you take precautions, it is very hard for anyone to poke into your personal business.

What your pedantic reply totally missed is the surge of publicity I expect once the bitcoin total value passes a billion dollars.  That is "big money" and will generate more stories, which in turn will propel the price even higher. The Gartner Group calls this process for new technology the "hype cycle".  The news media always look for things to write stories about.  When those stories propel interest in something, a new website, tech stock, social network, tool like 3D printers, or bitcoin, it can generate more users, developers, or buyers.  That can create a feedback loop if you get more stories about it.
I think we have reached such a situation with bitcoin.  The fundamentals of bitcoin as a useful technology to move funds is still there, but on top of that we have a lot of media attention, that is generating hype.  People should understand what is happening.

This is too simplified.  It is rational to lend if the loan rate is &gt; than the deflation rate.  It is also rational for a merchant to sell items on an installment plan (fixed payments per month) with no imputed interest rate, because otherwise they don't have a business for large items.

Bitcoin is neutral, but my hard drive space isn't free.  There is an economic cost for me and everyone else to store micro-transactions in the block chain, which in the aggregate can be more than the transaction is worth.  It is economically inefficient to do this.  Thus we would prefer that transactions smaller than some reasonable amount be pushed off the block chain to somewhere else.
I don't particularly care what the technical solution is.  Satoshidice and similar microtransaction handlers can use off-block chain accounts to store dust amounts, and only send them when they accumulate to a large enough balance.  I'm sure there are other answers, but what I don't want is the block chain to grow so fast that people stop storing full copies.

Think about it: whoever created bitcoin had a deep understanding of cryptography, knew how to cover their tracks, and the block chain makes every single transaction public while appearing to divorce your identity from them.  However, by monitoring traffic from a few key sites (exchanges and mining pools) you can tie many transactions to specific IP addresses, giving you a point of entry to identify who is making them.  And who do we know that has been monitoring traffic since the days of transatlantic telegrams and builds giant data centers to sift that traffic?
I'm not saying bitcoin was definitely developed by NSA cryptographers, but I think it's a theory that fits the facts known so far.  One way to test this theory is to turn it around, and ask if anyone who used bitcoin in the early days can identify the IP address that these early mining transactions came from?

You must of read the book, thanks.  (Or you pulled that number out randomly and it happened to be the estimate for development cost).
But no, it doesn't work that way.  Development cost for a full "Personal Factory" serving 200 people is estimated to be $66 million.  That doesn't mean it all comes from my pocket or all needs to be up-front.  The Personal Factory project is broken into phases, and the first phase is pretty small.  Demonstrating the first phase, and reasonably well developed plans for later phases would go into fundraising from inviduals (which we already did a bit of), angel investors, and conventional financing.  The early phase production outputs will also generate income.  
Pretty much it's like growing any business with a product line, where here the products are elements for the factory.  They don't all have to be designed and built at once.

Lets say I decide to spend 0.02 shares of SPY for a cup of coffee, because that is in my basket of currencies, and the coffee shop gets 0.002 oz of gold as payment, because that is what is in *their* basket of currencies.  Dollars don't enter into that transaction.  The payment network could use bitcoin to calculate conversion ratios, or just a table to directly convert SPY to gold.
The payment network has to hold enough of all the assets in the aggregate to cover everyone's balances.  For any given transaction, though, as long as it is relatively small, the network does not have to buy or sell the assets.  They only need to shift balances from one user to another.
Note this is a different concept than bitcoin.  It would be user-selected asset baskets used as currency, where the user chooses what percentage of each asset type makes up their personal basket, and the network does conversions between users.  
The main point here is this would be a private payment system, and not a government-issued currency, and that it's customizable per user, instead of "one size fits all".

If you are going to do this, you have to be prepared for when they ask "What's bitcoin?".  You need a 2 second, ten second, and one minute answer, depending on how interested they are and how much time they have. Don't try to explain the block chain and mining, most people won't care about how it works any more than they care how the cryptography in the bank ATM works.
Some ideas for the short answers (I'm sure other people can chime in with more suggestions):

"It's money that goes person to person online like email"

Everyone has a list of needs and desires they want to satisfy, and which motivates them.  Not only is this this list different from person to person, it changes constantly for each person.   For example, I may want a McDonalds hamburger more when I am hungry than if I am not.
Trade can happen when people rank something another person has higher on their list of needs and desires than what they already have.  Thus, I may rank the hamburger at a given moment more highly than the cash in my pocket.  The restaurant ranks my cash more highly than the hamburger ingredients.  Thus we make a trade.  Value is just the ratio at which we are willing to trade one item for another.  
Since currency is the generally acceptable trade good, we often express value in terms of currency per item, since that is easier.  But you can express an exchange rate for pizza slices in terms of apple pie slices if you wanted.  That's rarely done, but in currency exchange, they are normally quoted in terms of exchange ratios for each other.
Bitcoin functions as a currency acceptable in trade for other currencies and goods and services.  It's value is set like everything else, by the ratio of other things people are willing to trade it for, which in turn is driven by their personal needs and desires.


It is the process of reaching consensus on the order in which transactions happen, and therefore what everyone's account balance is.  The longest chain of blocks (each containing transactions) has the most effort put into creating it.  That is the one accepted by everyone as the consensus history.  Making a valid block hash hard to find is what forces some effort into creating the next block.  Otherwise everyone could write blocks without limit, and you could not tell which one is right.
In addition to the consensus function, a hash is a checksum on the contents of the block.  It verifies that the transaction data has not been altered.  Since the hash of the previous block is included along with the transactions in generating the next block, it also verifies the correct hash value of the previous block, which in turn validates the contents of the previous block.  Since each block validates the one before it, the entire history of bitcoin transactions is validated in a chain of connected blocks.  That's why we call it a "block chain".


The original paper by Satoshi Nakamoto that first described bitcoin says it best:
It allows people to trade directly with each other, without going through a third party like a bank.  Banks charge fees, make you vulnerable to identity theft, and steal the value of your money by inflation.  Oh, and they are slow and can refuse to do business with you for any number of reasons.  Maybe you don't care about any of these problems, and are happy with banks.  In that case you might not care about bitcoin.  But not everyone is happy with them, and they would like a better alternative.  Bitcoin is an attempt to solve these problems.

Each node checks the transaction is "valid", which includes if the sending account had enough funds to send.  This happens in a matter of seconds.  There is a high probability that once it gets to the merchant, it has been checked multiple times, and thus good.
Some nodes work on gathering transactions and validating them with an extremely hard to find checksum (hash).  If they find it first, they send out this new "block" across the P2P network, where it gets added to the permanent record of transactions (block chain). On average this happens every 10 minutes on the network.
Depending on the circumstances, a merchant can accept a transaction immediately (it has already been validated), or wait for some number of blocks to arrive afterwards (confirmations), counting from the first block to include that transaction. It's the difference between 99% sure the transaction is good, and 99.99999999% sure.  For buying a drink at the corner store, immediate acceptance is good enough.  If you are buying an automobile or a house, six confirmations (~1 hour) gives you more assurance, and is not really a significant delay given the other paperwork involved.

This is quite well understood by people studying self-replicating systems (like me).  If you look at the production flow diagram I am working on, you will see we self-generate power and mine raw materials:
So that is about as cheap as you can get for inputs.  The drawing is part of a book and larger design project that has much more detail:
There will still be things you need to buy, like raw land, and materials you can't get locally, but if your factory can make things cheaply, you can sell a surplus of something you *can* make to pay for those.

I guess I was unclear, so I changed the comment to read "free people from a shortage of material goods".  I fully understand that people want nice things, and that is not going to change.
The mature factory is intended to output food (robotic farming), building materials, and utilities like power and clean water, plus other products on demand.  The starter kit, or "seed factory" will be smaller and less capable, but is programmed to make parts for it's own expansion until it reaches the mature size.
Ideally you would like to do this with a single machine like a 3D printer.  But a 3D printer cannot print all it's own parts, and has a limited ability to make parts for other machines.  Thus the starter kit includes about a 8 different major types of elements (furnace, bridge mill, lathe, robotic vehicle, press, materials processor, electrical shop, and building), plus assorted attachments and tools. All of this is under automated control.  The idea is this set of machines working together can make most of the parts for new factory machines, as well as output useful products.
The robotic vehicle, for example, with suitable attachments, functions as a farm tractor to grow food, or to haul raw materials to feed the processing section.  The furnace melts metal to make castings, or heats water to power an electrical generator (you eventually build several furnaces to do different tasks).
Conventional factories are specialized, and physically separated, so you have to manually ship items between them.  If you combine the steps from raw materials to finished products in a single factory, you can (in theory) automate the entire process.  What you might lose in smaller scale of production, you can make up in higher efficiency.
More automation is coming, that should be obvious.  I just prefer there is an alternative to mega-corporations owning all the robots.  I would rather they be locally owned by the people who use them.

If you want to evade taxes, don't use bitcoin, use silver dollars to pay employees.  The exchange rate these days is about 26:1, so you only use about 4% as many silver dollars.  Then they can put that small number on their tax return as "how many dollars in income did you get".  The US law reads:


(Source:  , enter Title 31, Section 5103  ).
Since silver dollars are a United States coin, it's perfectly legal to receive them as income, and use them to pay your taxes.  Of course, since the number of coins is much smaller than what you get in paper money, you likely will be in the zero taxes owed bracket.  The IRS can't argue with the law above and try to claim a silver dollar is twenty six dollars, because it says right on the coin that it is one dollar.

Treat purchase and sale of coins as any other capital asset.  You paid X for them, including any fees.  That is your basis.  You sell them later for Y, also including fees.  Your net gain or loss is Y-X.
If you get paid in bitcoin in the course of business, it is "payment in kind", the same as if you get potatoes, or free rent in exchange for a product or service.  You record the value in dollars at the time you receive it.

You might want to start with the Fast Company article I wrote (and Chris Dannon heavily edited) as an introduction:

No, each bitcoin address is an account number like a conventional checking account has.  Your wallet.dat file, or the paper equivalents, contain the private key so you can sign transactions, like you would sign a paper check.  A transaction simply sends some amount of your balance to someone else's account number, again similar to a direct transfer between checking accounts.
At any given time, an account number can hold any amount of full and fractional coins.  The current balance is just the sum of all past incoming and outgoing transactions from that account.  Since all bitcoin transactions are recorded on the public transaction history (the block chain), anyone can check the balance on any account.  If you try to spend more than the account currently holds, the software will automatically reject it for insufficient funds.

I don't see it as a currency so much as a secure accounting database that allows people to make time-delayed trades.  They trade real goods and services now for an increase in their account balance on the books, and later can use that balance to get something else.  It relies on the security of the database, so that their balance will still be there later to trade away
The real value in the Bitcoin network is all the goods and services people are willing to trade with each other.  The database (block chain) and surrounding software is just how we keep track so we don't have to resort to barter.  Collectively it acts as a trustworthy accountant between people.

The difference is paper checks and bank cards have your name and account number printed on them by default, thus associating the two for anyone who sees those payment methods.  Bitcoin *doesn't* associate your identity by default, but you can still reveal it by other methods.  Examples are in-person purchase, where a security camera observes you while paying, or an online purchase where you give your shipping address.
So I think the proper description is "more privacy by default" rather than "anonymous"

This information is out of date.  According to  at the official exchange rate their GDP was $8.25 trillion in 2012, with a population of 1.34 billion.

Global e-commerce this year will be about 1250 billion USD (  ).  Assume bitcoin captures 20% of that volume, because there are already multiple payment systems in existence.  Also assume that the bitcoin "velocity" (annual transaction volume/money supply) is around 10.  
From those assumptions I would estimate the value of the bitcoin money supply at $25 billion when it reaches near term saturation.  Future improvements in usability and acceptance, and the general growth of e-commerce would change the assumptions, but I think this is a reasonable way to approach valuation.  Given the projected number of coins at the next reward halving (16 million) the implied price is 1562 USD/BTC.

On November 29th, 2012, the production of new bitcoins by finding blocks fell from a nominal 7200/day to 3600 per day.  The price was $12.33/BTC that day.  Today it was $16.96.  I expect the two are related.  Not all of the 10.7 million BTC are in active use, or even in existence any more. Some were lost in the early days by accident.  They are still in the block chain, but the owner doesn't have the keys to spend them, so they are useless from a supply and demand standpoint.  Some more are being held long term, and not being spent.
Since the supply of fresh coins has fallen by half, and demand is at least steady, and probably rising, basic economics says the price will rise until supply and demand are in balance.  My guess is the price will rise to double what it was on "halving day" (29Nov12), plus a bit for growth of the economy and media hype, so around $30 range.

Most of us have been taught when young that democracy is a good thing, and we don't question that assumption.   In reality political voting systems are a way for a subset of people to force their will on other people, which I consider immoral.  At best, a majority forces their will on a minority.  In representative systems, a miniscule subset can impose a solution which none of the citizens want (see: US Congrees).
In a business situation, like a partnership, voting as a means of reaching consensus doesn't have to be immoral, because a partner has the option of withdrawing altogether from the business if they don't like the decisions.  You don't have that option with political systems.
In a legal situation, a jury needs to reach unanimous consent, because we want to err on the side of not punishing someone if there is still a reasonable doubt.  Historically the Holy Roman Empire chose it's emperor by unanimous consent of the "electors" (7 or 8 princes and bishops).  This ensured whoever they chose was at least acceptable to everyone, though often ineffective.  Thus unanimous consent voting doesn't force people to do things they don't want to do, unlike plurality voting does.
Purchasing products or voluntary contributions to a project are a form of unanimous consent for the specific activity.  All the people who buy or contribute are in favor of that item, or they would not have bought/contributed.  In a market you can have multiple solutions.  In political systems you only get one solution, very often one you don't want.

Where it says "A person that creates units of this convertible virtual currency" gives the impression they think the units are separate individual things.  
It can be argued that bitcoins don't exist as units.  What we have is a big file, the block chain, and an agreed method to decide what the current version of that file is and how to add to it.  When a miner discovers a block and publishes it, they claim a balance of 25 for a given account number.  But that claim has to be validated by the rest of the network to be "confirmed" as belonging to the account.  Even after confirmation, there are not 25 units, there is one number, 25.00000000, attached to another number (the account), and which can then be divided up into arbitrary sized pieces.
Later where it says "if the person accepts such de-centralized convertible virtual currency from one person
and transmits it to another person" gives the impression they think it moves from place to place on the network.
As we know, transactions once recorded in the block chain don't go anywhere, they just sit there forever.  You can send a message (a new transaction) to the network, but that by itself does not move anything.  You hope your message gets included in a block, which gets added to the block chain, but again, no units of currency have moved anywhere.  You can only determine that one account has a higher balance and another has a lower balance by adding up the entire history of the accounts and calculating the current totals.
Given that we don't necessarily know who owns an account, we cannot tell if we are accepting from one person and passing it on to another.  It could be the same person for all we know.  So it is impossible to tell if you are covered by that part of their rules.
It just seems they have a fuzzy idea about what is actually happening.  Note also the title of this document is "Guidance", it is not law, it is just their interpretation.  To really understand this, you would need to go back to the law itself and court cases which interpret it.

If you are the size of Western Union, you don't need to use an exchange, you can set up your own.  Note that they already deal in 135 foreign currencies: 
I would assume they just set up their own bitcoin account(s) with a reasonable balance (maybe 1000 BTC) and just send and receive from customers who walk up to their counters or use the website directly.

When you use traditional (edit: bank payment networks) (was: methods), your identity is public by default, because your name and account number are both printed on the check or credit card you use, and therefore linked.
Bitcoin transactions only use the account numbers for transactions, so your identity is private by default.  However someone who is determined enough can trace transactions, or you can reveal your identity by something you did.  For example, if a bitcoin exchange sets up accounts with user identities, and you used that exchange, a government could force them to reveal that.  Or if you buy physical goods and have it delivered to your home, the seller knows your address.
If I posted my bitcoin address here to get donations for some charitable cause, I have just linked that address with my reddit account ID.
So it is not correct to say bitcoin transactions are fully anonymous automatically.  You can maintain your privacy if you take certain steps and avoid others.  But they are way more private than a check or credit card, which announces who you are to everyone who sees them.

We are still in the startup stage for bitcoin.  Once most of the coins are distributed, miners will make their income off transaction fees.  Those run around 1/10,000 of transaction volume.

You have little faith in insurance companies.  Lloyd's of London started by insuring highly risky ocean shipping ventures. They still insure satellite launches, it's just the premiums are like 5-15%.
Assuming a "bitbank" wants insurance, they would have to open up their processes and books to the insurance company, so that the insurer can tell they are using best practices and can calculate the risk.  That is what actuaries make a living doing.
The main reason we don't have "bitbanks" who loan out bitcoins is that the price rise from simply holding coins is huge relative to the spread you could earn from loans.  If bitcoin settles down at some price level relative to other goods, people will start loaning it to each other, and banking will arise, but not right now.

If they use BitPay or Coinbase, not only on an hourly basis, but in real time.  They peg their prices to their local fiat currency, and software presents the bitcoin price according to a current exchange rate.
By the time bitcoin has the transaction volume of a major currency, it will be as stable as a major currency, because news events and single actors will not have the power to move it.  And by stable I mean a 30% range over a period of years, like the US dollar vs Euro have to each other:

I agree, the premise of the article is just wrong.  Price isn't how you measure a currency, it is how much it gets used.
What I look at is the trend in transaction volume.  Here it's a 30 day average to smooth out the daily variations.  Even though there are some bumps, the exponential increase in trend is pretty clear on a logarithmic graph:
Meanwhile, the currency velocity averages about 8.  That means the average bitcoin is traded 8 times a year.  In other words, the average holding time is 45 days or 2.2% of total coins are used per day.  The price then is necessarily (transaction volume in dollars) / (coins available for trade).  A change in either would affect the dollar price, but the coins available seems to be relatively stable.  Thus the dollar price is being driven mostly by increase in volume in dollar terms.  So long as adoption is growing and total transaction volume with it, bitcoin is very much alive.

You can look up the current hashing rate here:  It's around 30,000 Gigahashes/second.  Divide the hashing rate of your hardware by that number.  I will use my GTX-260 as an example, it's hashing 40 Megahashes/sec, so is 1.3 x 10^-6 of the total network power.  Therefore I expect to earn that fraction of the 3600 new coins generated per day, or 0.0048 coins/day.  At current prices, that is worth $0.1632/day.  You would compare that to the cost of running the equipment, to tell if it earns a current profit.
My graphics card costs an incremental 94 watts of power to mine (above what the computer draws anyway).  I don't count my base PC power usage, because I am doing other things at the same time, like writing this post :-).  If you have a dedicated mining machine, then you need to count the full hardware and electricity costs.  So at my electric rates, it costs 2.25 kWh = $0.27/day to mine.  That's more than I earn in bitcoins, but I do it for two reasons:
* It's cold outside, and running the graphics card at max power helps heat this room.
* I am gambling that the coins I earn today will be worth more in the future.  So far, my total mining over the last couple of years is worth more than double the electric cost, because of Bitcoin price increase.  I also buy coins at an exchange, and have more of them that way.  Background mining is just a bit extra, and I feel good about helping support the transaction network and block chain.

Every bank and stock broker has to keep track of the balances in customer accounts.  This is a useful and necessary job, and the accounting department at these institutions gets paid for their work.  The Bitcoin network decentralizes the accounting task to people called "miners" who also get paid for their work, every time they complete a "block" of transactions.  They automatically are credited some newly created bitcoins for the work they did.
So, individual bitcoins are not imaginary, they represent the work in creating a verified accounting system.  The usefulness in an accounting system that anyone can use, anywhere in the world, to send funds to anyone else, very quickly, is what gives the network and individual coins their value.  If they were not useful to anyone, their value would indeed be imaginary, but enough people do, in fact, find it useful, that it has a rising value.
And if you think that currency units that mostly exist as just numbers in a network of computers are imaginary, well, US dollars are exactly that, imaginary.

The block chain has been growing by around 1 GB/month.  My last hard drive purchase was $70 for 2 TB.  So it is costing me $0.035 (3.5 cents) a month in storage costs.  That's pretty trivial to maintain a financial account.
When the block chain becomes painfully large, there are several ways to reduce the impact per person.  One is to prune the accounts that have spent all their balance.  They have nothing left to spend, thus nothing to verify against double-spending.  Another is to store the block chain in a distributed fashion, where each node holds some subset of blocks.  As long as enough people have copies of each subset to verify them, it should be secure.

I will assume you mean by deflation that goods and services in general are getting 7% cheaper relative to bitcoins, and that  1% margin means the difference between what they charge in interest from loans, and what they pay depositors.  
I will use as an example a new car loan to someone with good credit, which today costs 1.5% over inflation (3% nominal rate - 1.5% inflation).  If the bank wanted to keep the same level over deflation, they would charge -5.5%, and the loan wouldn't happen, since they could simply hold the bitcoins and earn more.
On the other hand, when I was fresh out of college with no credit history, and I needed a used car, I paid 14% over inflation for the loan.  So in your bitcoin scenario the bank would charge me 7% interest in bitcoin terms, and pay their depositors 6%.  In reality it would be less, since they pay out a blended rate from all their loans, and this would be a particularly high rate one.
The conclusion is some loans made today would not happen.  Likely what would happen instead is car manufacturers would offer new cars at a fixed price with term payments, that factors in the deflation.  So for example 0.3 BTC/month for 60 months could be a sales deal, with no interest calculated.
As a note, I think 7% deflation is unrealistic.  In an established bitcoin economy, usage would be stable relative to the rest of the economy, and therefore deflation would be equal to the growth of the economy as a whole.

I think it is more productive to put price changes in terms of supply and demand, rather than irrational "mania".  Commodities often have price spikes caused by a change in supply relative to demand.  For example, the 2011 floods in Thailand caused hard drive production to crash, while demand stayed about the same, and the result was this:
The recent spike in bitcoin price was due to a sudden influx of new people wanting some vs a rather static total supply, and a limited amount offered on exchanges at any given time.  Supply relative to demand changed, so did prices.

Merchant losses from credit card fraud is 3% of all transactions ($180 billion vs $6 trillion). (  ).  Add to that 2-3% more from card processing fees when the transaction is legitimate, and there is the potential to save 5% on card transactions.  This is a big incentive.  They won't reap the full 5%, bitcoin has overhead also, but the potential is there for savings.

My price data says it was $12.33 on 29 Nov 2012 and $13.94 on 10 Jan 2013. This is a compound rate of growth of 210% per year.  That is more than enough to account for a doubling in price in much less than the 4 year halving interval.  That the rate of price increase has jumped even higher in the last few days doesn't affect the earlier trend.
The other thing that changed on halving day is the trend of increasing mining difficulty changed to what is apparently a trend of decreasing difficulty.  Increasing difficulty means the average coin production was above 7200/day, and decreasing difficulty means the average production is now below 3600/day.  The cause of the change in trend is obviously the reward got cut in half, but it also means miners have dropped out - presumably because it is no longer worth mining for them.  The result is that "halving day" has resulted in more than a 50% drop in new coin supply.  It is more like a 60% drop.  Any such drop in supply against a relatively steady demand will eventually result in a price rise.  The reason for a month or two delay in a price rise may simply be the delay in the coin supply pipeline.  If miners cash out monthly to pay their electric or other bills, their contribution to the bitcoins in circulation happens then, not the day they did the mining.  In turn, whoever they sell their mined coins to will have fewer to use the following month.  So I find a few month delay in the price rise to be quite possible.

Yes, but the price of "rat poison" has gone up six-fold since then :-).
Even as methodical an investor as Munger focuses on the market price, and doesn't understand the underlying value, because bitcoin is new and different.
The Bitcoin Network (or BitNet for short) consists of user software, smartphone apps, a transaction database, nodes that relay transactions, and miners that confirm them.  Collectively they move money from one place to another, fast and with low fees.  This network has value because it is useful, just like a delivery truck is useful for moving packages.  It doesn't need backing by anything else, it has value for the service it provides.
Since the only way to use the BitNet is to get an address balance in the database (aka some bitcoins on the Block Chain), demand to move money through the BitNet creates demand for bitcoins.  Since the total quantity of bitcoins, and the quantity available to buy at any given time are limited, their unit price is set by supply and demand.
But bitcoins as units to hold and transmit can't exist without the BitNet to make them functional.  Any attempt to analyze bitcoins separately from the network will get a wrong answer.  It's like mistaking UPS shipping labels for the network of trucks and distribution centers.  The labels aren't much use either without their particular network.

This sort of hassle is part of why Mt Gox is setting up with Coinlab and Silicon Valley Bank.  Once set up, someone like xportz could open an account at Silicon Valley Bank directly, and wire funds from Canada to that account.  Bank to bank transfers between accounts you own at both ends should not raise issues.  If they do, the banking system is truly fucked.
Once at SVB, you can then easily send the funds to Coinlab/MtGox's account, because funds drawn at the same bank don't need clearing through the bank network, and the bank can verify you actually have the funds.

I think the range of funding sources explains why VirWoX is the 5th largest bitcoin exchange, and why 10% of Second Life's currency is being sold for bitcoins.
For anyone not familiar with it, Second Life is a 3D virtual world whose internal currency is convertible to dollars.  For the purpose of buying bitcoins, you only have to know enough to use a VirWox terminal to send funds from your avatar account.

Should bitcoin balances become sufficiently accepted and stable, they can rise to the level of a currency.  In the mean time, they are an easily traded commodity.

I said property owners would have an "interest", but they might pay for it through title insurance, and the title companies would provide hashing power, or some such arrangement.  It would be a fee based system rather than mining for new coins like we do with bitcoin.
One feature of such a system for property is there will be relatively few transactions but high value ones, so you may set up the difficulty and block frequency different than for bitcoin, or require multi-signature transactions (buyer, seller, court clerk?) to effect an ownership transfer.  The important part is to do enough hashing to ensure past transactions have a valid history.

Please remember that the figure for the Cayman Islands is local currency used on the island itself.  As an offshore stash for part of the world's US$20-30 trillion in hidden financial assets it likely handles a lot more money, but in other currencies.
I have not seen it talked about much relative to bitcoin, but "Offshoring", the business of moving funds between countries for some advantage, is huge.  Much of it is legal or borderline legal, like how Google stores profits in Bermuda to avoid US corporate taxes, or people move funds from their own unstable country to a more stable one for safe-keeping.  But a big chunk of it, perhaps a quarter to a third, is grey to black market.  Things like corrupt government officials stashing their bribes elsewhere, or drug money.
I personally observed what seemed to be drug money going from Colombia to other countries, many years ago when I worked at a big Wall Street bank.  I was too young and naive to realize what it was at the time, but the single transaction for exactly 1 million dollars from a tiny town nobody ever heard of was pretty memorable.  In retrospect it likely was on it's way to a financial safe haven.  The point is the big banks have always been there whenever large amounts of money are involved, and their private banking departments, and similar "international finance" departments at brokerage, law, and accounting firms have very smart people who specialize in keeping a step ahead of governments.
If people like those find a use for bitcoin in shuffling funds around the world, I think it would have huge implications for our little network.  I don't think they would get involved  until bitcoin volume was much larger, though.  They rely partly on the huge volume of the banking and financial markets to obscure what is going on.  Perhaps there is an opportunity in the near term for "offshoring for the little guy".  Doing the kind of thing Google does, but for companies and businesses that don't have billions to throw around.

Agreed.  I have a GTX-260, which is far from the best card to do mining on, and have mined consistently at a loss *at the time the coins were mined*.  Simply by holding the coins for a while, they are now worth about 5 times their cost of electricity.
If you think bitcoin will continue to gain merchants and users, the price will *have* to go up because of the finite supply, and if you have the patience to wait a while, mining for coins can be a great investment.
This does not apply to professional miners who need to pay their electric bill immediately and thus cash out their coins.  I use this computer anyway, so the incremental cost to mine in the background is pretty small.

There are potentially 63 Satoshi for every dollar's worth of all the world's currency combined ($33 trillion currently).  That is based on all 21 million BTC being mined, thus 2.1 quadrillion Satoshi.

The NSA, as it's name indicates, is tasked with national security, mainly by "signals intelligence" - the monitoring of communications.  Funding of nefarious activity by cash, commodities like gold and diamonds, or accounts in places with strong banking secrecy is hard to monitor.  So the incentive is to create a channel that *seems* to be private, and draws some of the illicit funding flow into a form they can monitor, ie an online transaction history.
Any accumulated bitcoins they still hold would be irrelevant.  The cost to them was whatever time and effort to create the software, and the computers to do the initial mining.  The benefit *now* is whatever intelligence they can extract from monitoring current transactions, and correlating that with other data they collect.  
What the NSA does is not simply look for messages that say "the bomb will go off at 10:30".  What they look for is patterns across many data sources.  For example, encrypted email is sent from a Starbucks with wifi.  6 cell phones are present at the same time.  One of these cell phones also makes an international call.  This is an unlikely pattern, so now they further look at data connected to the phone and email.  
A bitcoin network just gives them more data to pattern match against.  They don't have to control it or make money off it, just set it loose and watch it.
Let me point out again I have no hard evidence for my NSA theory, but the NSA is known for hiring mathematical theorists and programmers.  So they would be *capable* in principle.  Even if they had nothing to do with creating bitcoin, they can still monitor it and match it to other data to extract significant patterns.

I may not be an Einstein, but I do have a physics degree.  You are right, I know better than to treat bitcoins as an investment.  They are accounting tokens in a payment network.  They have value only as long as the network is not replaced with something better, and the competition (PayPal, Western Union, etc.) are worse.
Demand to move money creates demand to use the network.  To use the network you have to have some of the internal tokens.  Since the number of tokens is limited, their price fluctuates with demand.
So if you need to move money, bitcoins are a good solution right now.  But if you want a long term store of value, use bitcoins to buy a useful or productive asset.

"mills" are in fact the unit for 1/1,000 of a dollar, like "cents" are 1/100 and "dimes" are 1/10.  They come from the Latin for thousand, hundred, and ten.
Mills have fallen out of common use because they are too small for coinage, except for property taxes.  They apply a "millage rate" to the assessed value as "thousandths of a dollar per dollar of value".  That avoids needing to use fractional percentage tax rates, since property tax rates are often below 1% per year.

You are confusing Gross Product with money supply.  In the US today, annual product is 7 times the money supply.  That is because people and businesses don't need to keep a whole year's worth of their income in money.  They keep enough money for transactions, and it circulates multiple times a year.
Bitcoin, at the moment, is circulating 10 times a year, therefore the value only needs to be 1/10 of the goods and services bought with it each year.  The entire world's money supply, in all currencies, is $33 trillion vs your $79 trillion Gross World product.  Thus all money as a whole turns over 2.4 times a year.
I don't know how much clearer I can make this.  Money in circulation does not equal Gross Product.  Money x Velocity = Gross Product when all transactions use money, which they do not.  
A farmer who grows his own food uses no money for that food, and yet he produces value.  So does a home-owner who does his own home improvements, for the labor part.

The US tax system operates on a combination of voluntary and legally required reporting.  For example, employers, banks, and brokers are required to send reports to the IRS, and most people file tax returns voluntarily.  All that information tells the IRS who is in the US, because it has names attached.
If no information is filed about you, they have no idea who you are or where you are located.  Since the block chain does not contain names and physical locations, it is not useful for tax collections.  But other data about a transaction may reveal it.  For example, if a business reports they paid you for some freelance graphics work as an expense of their's, and there is no corresponding return on your side, they might come after you.
On the other hand, if they say the freelancer was Romanian, and was paid in bitcoins, the IRS has no way to check on a foreign business, and the coins could very well just have gone to another address of the same business.  Thus bitcoin might be a good way for a business to pad expenses and thus lower their apparent profit, and thus tax.  Since the IRS likes to see a "paper trail", there should then be fake invoices and emails to document the fake expense.
In such a circumstance, the only use of the block chain is to show the IRS "here, we bought those bitcoins on our account at this exchange, and then later here is the transaction we sent the payment to Romania".  The IRS would have to accept their word, because there is no way to prove different.  As a practical matter, the IRS only has the manpower to check up on some small businesses.  If you have receipts,
invoices, and other documentation to back up a transaction, usually they accept it, because they simply don't have time to dig deeper.  It's only if they have conflicting data from another source that they would keep digging.
So the question a tax-dodging business would have to ask themselves is whether there is other data out there to rat them out, and how likely the IRS is to make the connection and pursue it.  Many businesses flat out lie on their tax returns, and get away with it, because the IRS doesn't catch everything.  They are playing an inverse lottery, where if your number comes up, instead of a prize, you lose big time.  They feel the odds vs their savings in taxes are worth the risk, or they would not lie.
The IRS is made up of below-average accountants.  The really good ones become private CPAs or go to work for top accounting firms.  Thus their assessment of the odds of getting caught are often found to be correct.

There is also a hobbyist level of activity at which neither you nor the IRS will bother.  Because of the relationship to a certain bitcoin exchange, I will use Magic - the Gathering cards as an example.
If you play that card game, and trade the cards with other players on a hobbyist level, nobody will come after you for taxes if you come out ahead.  If you run a comics and collectibles shop, and buy and sell rare MtG cards for profit, then you are expected to report profits.  If you are a serious comics collector, and you sell your collection for tens of thousands of dollars, the IRS will want their cut.

The value is in the goods and services paid for through the Bitcoin network.  Since the accounting units in the database are finite, as the volume of goods and services goes up, so does the value of one unit.
The exact same thing happens with the US Dollar, or any other national currency.  It's the volume of goods and services being exchanged in relation to the number of accounting units that determines their value.  The difference is the number of units is set by central bankers instead of a software algorithm.
Nobody orders the Dollar to have a particular value, that would be "price controls", which we generally don't have.  What fiat currencies have is an order that it be accepted for certain purposes (payment of debts and taxes).  It is forced acceptance rather than voluntary acceptance that makes a fiat currency.

Lets look at some numbers:
One crude oil futures contract is for 1,000 barrels: 
At current prices that's about $100,000 per contract
Trading volume is on the order of a million contracts a day: 
Note: Trading volume amounts to 1 million contracts x 1000 barrels = 1 billion barrels/day.  World oil production is around 90 million barrels/day:   Therefore a given barrel on average trades many times a day between the oil field and the refinery.
$100,000 per contract x 1 million contracts = $100 billion/day trading volume.
Bitcoin estimated transaction volume is $150 million/day recently.  Even if futures contracts trade on margin (which they do), reducing the amount of cash needed to back a contract, I don't see how bitcoin could support oil trading.
Oil delivery, rather than futures, is still a $9 billion/day operation.  If you price the product in a currency, presumably you will accept the currency as payment, or the price is meaningless.  Bitcoin volume can't support that level of trade.
Instead of this rather outrageous prediction, I expect use of bitcoin to spread slowly backwards through the supply chain.  A few gas stations take bitcoin now.  Once enough places are taking it at the retail level, a few distributors may start to accept it for delivering a truckload of fuel.  Given enough time, that may spread back to the original producers, but I see that happening over a long time period, like 20 years, not in 2014.

"Fiat" is Latin for "Let it be so."  A fiat currency is one declared by by an authority to be currency.  This is usually a government or central bank.  As long as no authority declares bitcoin to be an official currency, it is a voluntary one, and obtains it's status as a currency because people choose to use it as such.
If you are thinking of what backs a currency, with most modern national ones, they are overwhelmingly backed by debt.  For the US dollar, in order it is bank loans, Treasury bonds, agency debt (mostly mortgages), and lastly gold certificates (which are not redeemable, but theoretically backed by gold in vaults).  If you are thinking of electronic vs physical use, 92% of the world's money supply is electronic, and 8% is notes and coins.  Bitcoin is more like 99% electronic, and perhaps 1% coins and offline paper wallets (I don't know the actual split, and probably nobody else does either)


That's not possible, there are already three dozen other cryptocurrencies, and nothing to stop people from creating more.


First of all, bitcoin doesn't have a limited money supply, it has limited units of account.  Fiat currencies try to manage the money supply by issuing new units of account, supposedly keeping the value of the unit constant.  Bitcoin adjusts the money supply by supply and demand for units of Block Chain balances.  People call those units "a bitcoin", but they are actually a number representing the balance of an address/account, or the amount being transferred between addresses in a transaction.
Since the only way to use the Bitcoin network is by trading on these balances, as demand to use the network goes up, so does the demand for balances, and their price in terms of everything else (including other currencies) will go up.  Since the "money supply" is simply the value per unit times the number of available units, the money supply would then expand.
Once bitcoin reaches maturity and the fluctuations in price die down, or you can hedge against them, interest would work the same as any currency.  Loan me X bitcoins now, and I promise to pay back X+interest later.  The need to pay back the loan will create demand for Block Chain balances to do it with, raising the bitcoin money supply enough to cover loan demands.  That's on top of any other demand from other uses.
Right now, only an idiot would borrow bitcoins with payment due in bitcoin terms, because of the large chance it will cost them a lot more in the future to pay back the loan.  A loan in terms of "X dollars worth of bitcoins at the current Coinbase rate" to be paid back as "X dollars + interest worth of bitcoins at the Coinbase rate at that time" would be rational, as the value of the dollar is a lot more stable right now.

More exactly, a bitcoin is the unit of measure in transactions, and transactions only move balances from one account to another.  The special "generation" transaction, where new coins are created with each block, requires a hard to find hash value for the block contents.  To create new coins, you need to find the right hash, or the network rejects your block and you have nothing.

I agree with your analysis, but to explain it in simple terms, I put it this way:
What would ebay be worth as a market to buy and sell stuff if it had no users?  Pretty much zero.  Ebay actually has over 100 million "active users" (however they define that).  Therefore it is a very valuable marketplace for both buyers and sellers.
Similarly, back before the First Pizza was paid for with bitcoins, the value was near zero.  It was an interesting experiment in cryptography but not much beyond that.  As the number of buyers and sellers has grown, so has the value of the marketplace.  Since the total balances on the Block Chain (i.e. "number of bitcoin units") is growing much slower than the number of users, then necessarily the value of a given unit must rise.

3. A bitcoin exchange is just a store that buys and sells local currencies for bitcoins and the reverse.  People can and do buy and sell directly with each other   but there might not be anybody close, or with the amounts and hours to suit you.  Exchanges are online and open all the time
4. A bank takes deposits AND makes loans, using their own plus depositor funds.  In most countries they are regulated.  The value of bitcoin fluctuates more like a stock or commodity, so making loans with them is very risky.  You have no idea if your loan will be paid back with coins worth as much as you lent.  National currencies may lose value due to inflation, but the rate of loss is somewhat predictable, and you can factor that into the interest rate.  You should not expect bitcoin banking to develop until the value of the coins is much more stable than it is now.
As a conduit to traditional investments, bitcoin would work fine.  For example, if you wanted to send money to a broker to buy shares of Google stock, or treasury bonds.  It is only being used to transmit funds, and the broker at the other end converts it back to local currency fairly quick, so price changes don't matter.  I don't know of any traditional broker set up to take bitcoin yet.
I could set up a corporate account with a broker, accept bitcoin, convert it to dollars, and buy whatever people wanted me to with the dollars, but then there would be a problem reporting gains and losses to the IRS.  Bitcoin users generally don't want to out themselves as far as their real life identity, so I would be forced to file as a business as far as gains and losses.  I'm not sure what line on Schedule C (profit or loss from business) to list "money unidentified people on the internet sent me".

Banks still have a place for business in making loans, but simply moving money from point A to point B can be done more efficiently.

You cannot possibly lend 21 million bitcoins, because that is the most that will ever be generated.  The keys to some have been lost, and others are held in long term storage by their owners, and you simply can't get your hands on them.
In order to lend them, you must first have them, and unless you want to punish yourself, you won't make a loan so big that you force the market price up just to acquire them.  So rational lenders will limit their loans to a small fraction of the available supply.

It's very possible, and reasonably wise.  Coinbase makes it easy to purchase the coins.  Once you have them, it should be easy to send them to a private wallet like Electrum that lives on your PC.  You just need to know an address generated in the private walllet, then tell Coinbase to send your coins to that address.
How wise doing that is depends on how good you are about PC security and backups.  If a wallet file is stolen by malicious software and not encrypted, they could spend your coins.  If the wallet file is encrypted, they can't do much with it.  If your hard drive crashes and the wallet is lost, you can't spend the coins, so they are effectively gone forever.  So backups are important.

It's 1 MB/block, which will fit about 4000 transactions.  Thus the block chain would nominally grow by 52.6 GB/year, imposing a cost of around $2.50/year in hard drive space for full client users.
There are various ways to deal with block chain bloat.  One is to "prune" the transaction history, for example removing accounts which have zero balance.  Another is to distribute the full block chain over a P2P network, for example 100 users have 10 copies between them, so each only stores 10% of the blocks.  You request data as needed from the network.  
A third is starting up branch chains which collect smaller transactions from a pool of users and convert them to larger single ones which go branch to branch on the main block chain.  The branches post destination data for each other so they know who to distribute funds to that arrives from the main block chain.  As a user with an account on a branch, you would only need to store the transaction history of that branch.

Well, if it is a full client like Bitcoin-QT, it receives transactions, in the form of blocks for the block chain, or individual transactions as they propagate.
In reference to the original question - People don't send bitcoins to you.  They post a transaction to the network which updates everyone's copy of the transaction history.  That history then shows your account having a larger balance, and the sender having a smaller balance.
It is similar to if you walked into your bank, and asked them to move some money from your checking account to someone else's.  Your balance goes down, and their's goes up.

In order to create a fake transaction, you must solve a block faster than the whole rest of the network.  You must solve a block, otherwise your block hash will not be valid, and everyone will reject it.

No, the average is about 6 minutes.  Blocks are being generated @ 7/hour currently, thus on average a block gets generated every 514 seconds.  Thus every second there is a 1 in 514 chance of a new block being generated, because finding a block is a random process.  In 4 minutes there is a 37.5% chance of finding a block, and in 5 minutes it is 44.3%, in 6 minutes 50.4%. 
You should add a few seconds for your transaction to propagate to all the miner nodes, and this assumes an adequate fee so they include it.

If I was a cryptographer working for dim-witted managers, I could see poking fun at them in a way they wouldn't notice. :-).  Perhaps the clues in the name don't point to who Satoshi worked for, but instead point to who would use Bitcoin for their own purposes:
* NSA - As an agency their job is "signals intelligence", collecting data from multiple sources and correlating them to find patterns.  The block chain is a perfect source of data - every transaction is recorded and public.  By itself it does not reveal much.  If you are an agency with widespread monitoring of communications and enormous data centers, though, you can perhaps match the timing of a transaction to an email or a phone call and identify something nefarious going on.
* CIA - They need a clandestine way to pay for things around the world -weapons, informants, whatever.  Bitcoin works well for that.  Ironically, the greatest danger of exposing their operations may come from increased government monitoring of financial transactions to fight terrorism and money laundering.  A payment network outside the normal banking channels with plausible deniability would work well for hiding their activities.
Even if these agencies had nothing to do with creating Bitcoin, they can certainly *use* it for their own purposes.  What is the relative cost to the NSA of running a bitcoin client to get an updated copy of the block chain?  Trivial when you own whole data centers.  How much does it cost the CIA to set up an account with Mt.Gox, so they can send payments to agents? Again, trivial.  The surprising thing would be if they *didn't* use Bitcoin.

Because blocks have a finite size limit (1 MB), what will eventually happen is people spawn off separate transaction pools that aggregate small transactions into larger ones on the main block chain, with significant fees on them.
Miners want to make enough income to support themselves, and as the block reward decreases over time, they will depend more on transaction fees.  Thus they will prefer to process transactions with higher fees.  Small one with zero fees will get crowded out.  So the natural response is for people to set up pools to group transactions together into larger ones, to get them processed.
Any transaction entirely within a pool gets handled by that pool's own block chain, using the same kind of technology as the main block chain does.  One that needs to go outside the pool gets collected with others, and then eventually sent to the main block chain, with an attached fee.
When the destination is another pool, the details of which account gets how much is sent directly from pool to pool, in effect an annotation to the main transaction.  Cross-pool clearing can use a public system so that anyone can check transactions in progress.
By offloading small transactions from the main block chain, you make it possible to increase the total number of transactions without exploding the size of the transaction history.

I have studied the paper referenced in the article (  ), and the trick is the separation of legal ownership and control.  For example, I am legally entitled to the benefits of my former employer's retirement fund, but I have zero control over what what they invest in.  That's chosen by the fund managers, who are typically a Wall Street investment house.  The same goes for mutual funds.  The shares are owned by the individual investors, but are controlled by the fund managers.
Thus these "investment management" entities, which are often part of banks, brokerages, or separate "capital management" entities, exercise disproportionate control over corporations.  As a group, these "institutional investors" hold 2/3 of all stock shares, and thus have absolute control:
 (see the start of section 3)
Normally they don't directly intervene in corporate operations, that is left to the corporate management and the board.  But the board is typically drawn from the same community of management from other companies and financial industry types, and the major shareholders are certainly listened to.  If a company messes up badly, the institutional investors will step in and demand a change of management or corporate direction, or sell/break up the company.  The latter case is engineered by the same Wall Street investment banks who manage a lot of the funds.  
So it is a small circle of people who ultimately control corporations, but they only exercise that control when necessary.  As long as the corporations produce steady profits, they are content to sit back and collect their fees.  Oh, and who gets to decide the high salaries and fees of this group of people?  Yeah, the same people.  I sure was never asked if the management fees for my retirement fund were reasonable.

You can also start up an alternate block chain designed to record ownership rather than bitcoin transactions.  This would have larger text fields to hold complete contracts and bills of sale.  The chained block hashes still verify the contents of a block have not been tampered with.  Since ownership of major assets does not change as often as currency moves around, this block chain would not be very bloated.  You can even record the payment method along with the contract by referencing a bitcoin transaction.

The coin generation will halve about every 4 years, so even if volume was level, in about 24 years it would no longer be the main source of mining fees.  But we expect the volume of transactions to increase in dollar terms. They may stay level in bitcoin terms, but each coin worth more.  So the crossover of fees dominating coin generation is likely to come before 24 years.


You are perhaps unaware that default fees have already been adjusted a few times, and that fees in general are a matter of user choice.  Supply and demand sets the fees and miner income from them.  Inefficient miners will get weeded out and the remainder will have enough income to keep operating.

Dumbasses abound online, but fear is a valid reaction for the public.  A new monetary system they don't understand can induce worries that all their current money and asset values will become obsolete.  We can allay that fear by explaining that bitcoins are traded for national currencies, so it does not replace them, simply supplement them.  So there is no reason to be afraid of bitcoins.
(In the long run, bitcoin *could* replace national currencies, but that will take a long long time to happen.  Too many things are priced in national currencies right now.)

After tax returns on Certificates of Deposit pretty much cancel out inflation:
If people are going to park their money for extended times, they demand at least breaking even on average, in real terms.  Of course, there are fluctuations.  Nobody pays 5% these days, you are lucky to get a tenth of that.
The fact is, 3% average inflation over the last century has distorted market incentives.  It encourages debt, because you get to pay it back with cheaper dollars.  Governments on the whole borrow more, for the same reason.  More debt, of course, makes bankers happy.  Loans are their primary business.

You think rick people know how to do it themselves?  Nope, it's tax accountants and private banking departments that set up these tax havens for them.  If bitcoin becomes useful for transferring funds quietly and quasi-legally, the specialists will learn how to do it, and their customers will benefit.
Note that not all tax havens are illegal.  You can exploit differences among laws in different countries, and park earnings in one place to avoid taxes in another.

Also, several hashes used in creating the address make it harder to to determine the private key.
See:

Every node (client program) on the bitcoin network runs the algorithm.  
Each node receives new transactions from other peers on the network.  It then checks them in various ways, including against the block chain to make sure there were enough bitcoins in the sending address to make the transaction.  If it finds the transaction is valid (passes all the checks), it adds it to the local pool of new transactions, and forwards it to other peers.
Miners are also nodes on the network.  They attempt to form new blocks from the new transactions by finding a suitable hash value.  This includes a "Generation" transaction to make new coins, which they send to themselves.  Once they find a block, they pass it along the peer to peer network.  Each node validates the block is correct (right hash value, right number of coins in the generate transaction, no spurious transactions, etc).  If it is correct, they add it to their copy of the block chain, remove the transactions in the block from the pool of new transactions, and pass the block along.
Thus *every* node in the network is responsible for passing along new blocks, and adding it to their local copy of the block chain.  It's like everyone has their own private accountant keeping the bitcoin books, and therefore they don't need to trust anyone else, because they check it themselves.

Actually, astronomers and orbital mechanics predict the future quite accurately, and demographers do so over shorter periods with reasonable accuracy.
Market forces are not as easy to analyze as physics and population trends, but they can be predicted to some extent.  Bitcoin's innate advantages include low fees compared to the alternatives.  As long as this is true, there will be a trend to adopt it.  
The question is when will that trend saturate?  That's too hard to predict, but we can observe statistics like blockchain and coinbase wallet user count, and bitpay and coinbase merchant counts, and can expect those trends to at least continue for a while in the direction they have been going (up).

Questionable backing and inflation driven by open-market operations makes the value of the dollar unstable, and in fact they have lost 95% of their value since the creation of the Fed a century ago.  They still have value, though, and are useful in day-to-day transactions.  I hold bitcoins partly as a hedge against further decrease in the value of the dollar, but I still need dollars until the bitcoin economy grows a lot larger than it is now, and lots more security and features are built for handling bitcoins on top of the basic protocol.

Property ownership in general can be automated, not with bitcoin itself, but with the block chain type of distributed public ledger.
Consider what a US county courthouse does with property deeds.  They are the public record of who owns what land.  Individual deeds are signed by the seller, transferring ownership to the buyer.  Then a copy of the deed is filed with a clerk, and it ends up in a physical record book in a vault, which anyone can look at.  These days it also get scanned or put on microfiche.
A block chain does a very similar task.  You sign a transaction with your private key, transferring ownership of some account balance in bitcoins, and it ends up in a public record that anyone can look at.  Simply by replacing the bitcoin part of the transaction with a signed document describing some property, you now have a public records system for ownership of real goods.
The real goods can be property, or stock shares, or automobile titles, or anything else you want.  A block chain system now enables two things the old system didn't do well.  One is lowering transaction costs.  The other is enabling transfer of fractional ownership.  Want to buy 0.047 ownership of some land, or 2.458 shares of Apple stock?  With a block chain type system you can, assuming a seller is willing to chop up the ownership that way.

This should not be news.  The 16th Amendment to the US Constitution says (boldface mine):


So it doesn't matter if the income comes from bitcoins, selling chickens, or space aliens.  They are still going to want to tax it if they think you made a net income.  Now, finding out a transaction happened and how much net income it represents is an entirely different problem.  Bitcoin makes that much harder.
Given that the total underground economy in the US is estimated at 18%
the IRS has much bigger tax leaks to plug than the one caused by bitcoin (for now).  I don't expect them to devote much attention to it unless it comes up in an audit for some other reason.  As the US bitcoin economy grows, they will start to worry about it more.

Political voting at best is a way to force the people who don't want what you want to go along with you.  Even if you have a majority, that means up to 49% of the people are unhappy.  In a representative system it can get much worse, you can end up with something being forced on citizens which none of them wanted.

New blocks confirming a transaction will always be generated at 1/ten minutes average, because the software adjusts the difficulty to maintain that rate.
Unconfirmed transactions can arrive in seconds, since those are delivered by the peer-to-peer network.  If your wireless device peers with the bar's computer, it will be instant.  If it connects through random peers on the network, it takes a few seconds.
Unconfirmed transactions have no relation to the hash rate, they are just relayed from peer to peer.  Miners accumulate transactions then attempt to solve a block, which takes much more time.

You are comparing the wrong things.  The Bitcoin network is like the trading network at the New York Stock Exchange.  The NYSE network allows people to buy and sell assets (shares of stock), but is not a major asset itself.  The NYSE network has a database somewhere that records movements of shares between accounts, and computers and cables to transmit that information to it's users.  
Similarly, the Bitcoin network has a database that records movements of account balances between accounts (the block chain), and a P2P network to transmit the information to its users.  What people often do is mistake the database for the real assets people are trading.  It's not, any more than a paper stock certificate is an asset in and of itself.  Both stock certificates and bitcoins are certificates of ownership representing a share in an underlying economic activity.  For a stock, it's a share of a particular company.  For a bitcoin, it's a share of the combined goods and services people are trading with each other.

Yeah, many people still think of "a bitcoin" as if it has an independent existence as an object.  It actually is closer to a unit of measure, like "a meter".  You can't hold a meter, or send a meter, but you can measure things in terms of meters.  Bitcoins are the unit of measurement for transactions on the bitcoin network, and recorded in the block chain.
The actual "thing" you can own and transfer is an account number, and the private key that controls it.  That account number has a "size" measured in bitcoins, and like most sizes, can be some odd fractional amount of units, like my height is 1.778 meters.  Maybe someday that concept will get through to authors.

It wasn't designed to be a store of value.  Ultimately the Bitcoin Network (or BitNet) is just a very efficient accounting system.  As such, it makes a good medium of exchange.  Data entries in the distributed account book (the Block Chain) are easily made and posted to everyone who cares via the Internet.  The other features we are familiar with (cyrptographic signatures for transactions, hashing to reach consensus) make it especially secure when used right.
Demand for entries in the account book (i.e. bitcoins as currency units) is purely set by supply and demand.  If a better payment network comes along, demand might go to zero, in which case so would the value of a bitcoin.
A reliable store of value is one which doesn't go away when new technology comes along.  An example is real estate.  People will always need a place to live, thus land will always have some value.


This simply isn't true.  You can use one product for short term exchanges, and another for long term storage.  As long as there is reasonably frictionless conversion between them, they don't have to be the same product.
This smacks of the divine right of kings era of political theory, where the maker of laws, judge of capital cases, and leader of the army were combined in one person.

Of course it is legal.  The regulations mistakenly claim bitcoins are "transmitted", when actually they only exist on the block chain, and never leave it.  They are like entries in a spreadsheet.  It's not transmission to change the values in the cells of a spreadsheet, and neither is it transmission to change the balance associated with a bitcoin address.
The mistake the article author makes is thinking the government has a clue about what they are trying to regulate, and that twisting the meaning of words like "transmitter" beyond reason, in order to fit some political goal, would hold up under legal scrutiny.

The inherent usefulness of the Block Chain is why people give it value, just like they do for Microsoft Office, or a hammer.  It does not need backing because it has use value in itself.
The more people that accept bitcoin in payment, the more useful the Block Chain becomes, and the higher the value of each fragment of the total balances (bitcoin units) becomes.  If something better comes along that is more useful, the value will go down

Bitcoin estimated transaction volume is $35 million a day currently:
Exchange volume is in the $2.5-3 million a day range:
I conclude two things from this data.  One is that trading is not driving the price, it is too small in relation to overall transactions.  Second, the annual transaction volume, $35M/day x 365 = $12.775 billion is in reasonable relation to the currency supply of 11.7 million coins x $125 (I don't count the Gox premium due to inability to cash out in dollars).  That comes to $1.462 billion currency supply with a "velocity" of 8.7.  Velocity is the number of times a year the average currency unit changes hands.
The US dollar M1 velocity is currently 6.5: 
so bitcoin is in the same ballpark.
The broader M2 money supply includes time deposits, so it necessarily has to move slower.  That velocity is 1.6:   I don't think that is the right monetary data to compare to, because bitcoins are not locked into time deposits, there are all immediately spendable, like cash.

If you are merely selling, and not creating bitcoins, you don't fall under this paragraph.  The question is who "creates" bitcoins?  The strongest argument is for miners who discover a block.  Since most of them operate in pools, and the pool operator merely transfers shares to the pool members, even the pool operator does not "sell" the units, thus they are in the clear.
As an individual miner, if you sell your mined coins *at the location you mined them*, you cannot logically be "engaged in transmission to another location".  Of course, the FinCEN rules assume the "units" have a definable location, like physical objects.  Bitcoins are entries in the Block Chain database, which exists everywhere there is a copy.  They are everywhere and nowhere.  You can define the location of a copy of the block chain, but that is no more the location of a bitcoin than a line from the Bible has a location because you happen to have a copy of the entire book.

You are confusing "open market operations", where the Fed buys in the public market to implement monetary policy (i.e. interest rates), and local banks buying and selling circulating notes from their local branch of the FED (  ).  Those notes have to be paid for 1:1 by the local bank, and the FED is required by law to maintain sufficient collateral to back the notes.
If the local bank pays with suitable assets (Treasury bonds, mortgage-backed securities, etc.) they become the collateral directly.  Otherwise the FED assigns some of it's other assets as collateral.
Open market operations are above and beyond circulating notes.  Circulating notes are based on local bank demand for them.  Open market ops depend on what the Fed thinks it needs to do, and currently is about twice as large as currency balances.  They have bought a fuck-ton of mortgage backed securities the last few years to hold down interest rates, plus past treasury bond activity.

I have seen bitcoin called lots of nasty things, and fiat is hardly the worst of them.  Personally I call the Bitcoin network a "secure accounting database" for people who want to trade goods and services.  If you think about what banks do for depositors on a practical basis, they maintain accounts, and credit and debit deposits and payments from the account balances.  
The block chain and Bitcoin network performs the same function of crediting and debiting from account balances.  The arbitrary tokens we call "bitcoins" bear a remarkable similarity to one of the earliest accounting systems, which used clay tokens (  ).  Those tokens represented ownership of sheep and goats, and were sealed inside hollow clay balls that were baked to prevent tampering with the accounts data, much as we create blocks in the block chain.
Neither the clay tokens nor bitcoins have value in and of themselves.  They are just agreed methods of record-keeping within a trading community.  The actual value is in the goods they represent.  Given the finite number of tokens in the Bitcoin community, the more people and trading volume, the higher the value of the tokens must be.  This is because on average people will hold the tokens for some amount of time before trading them away again, creating a demand against the relatively fixed supply.

The problem is 1 MB maximum block size / ~250 bytes per transaction = ~4,000 transactions/block maximum.  At one block/600 seconds, then you get ~ 7 transactions per second maximum.  This limits the scaling of bitcoin.
With a single block chain, there are two ways to raise the transaction rate limit.  Larger blocks have been discussed extensively.  This paper looks at more blocks per time interval.
You can also take transactions "off chain" by various methods, and keep the current rate limit.  But you can't scale bitcoin to hundreds of millions of users if the network can only handle 4,000 transactions/block x 6 blocks/hour x 24 hours/day = 576,000 transactions/day maximum.

Yet another economist brings up the deflation fallacy, so I am going to try and debunk it:
The official inflation rate in the US has run around 2-3% in recent years:
My checking account earns 0% interest, so I know the money in that account is losing value.  Despite that, I keep about a month's worth of balance for daily spending.  I am not driven to spend every penny before it loses value, because the amount involved is just not that big a deal.
When I consider larger economic choices - buying a house, or investing in stocks and bonds, I know enough to factor in the inflation rate.  For houses, I expect the price to go up on average with inflation, and for stocks and bonds, I subtract the inflationn rate from the nominal return to get the "real" (inflation adjusted) return.
If instead of mild inflation we have mild deflation (a few percent a year), nothing much changes.  I still need to eat and pay rent and utilities, so I will still spend money every month.  That the money itself might be worth a bit more each month does not factor in.  Monthly expenses are a more immediate need, and that overrides any long term factors.
For the larger economic choices, I would now factor in the deflation rate.  Whatever interest rate I might pay on a mortgage now has to include the fact that the money will be worth more, and the house less in future currency.  That has the effect of me wanting lower rates, and borrowing less.  That may be better for the long-term health of the economy, since people today probably over-invest in houses, expecting them to go up.  Thus they under-invest in other things that are more productive.
For stocks and bonds, the nominal return now gets the deflation added to the nominal return, to get the real return.  Therefore I would accept a lower nominal return, which means a higher value on investment assets.
So I see nothing bad happening in the case of mild deflation.  Now, hyper-deflation, like hyper-inflation, is a bad thing.  The rate of change of the currency value then overrides rational choices about spending and saving.  Bitcoin will never be hyperdeflationary from the number of units in circulation.  The number issued only goes up, and the number available only shrinks from lost coins, hopefully not too many in the future.
The value of a unit has been rapidly increasing since 2010 (on average), but that is driven by adoption.  At some point I expect adoption to level off, and the value to stabilize.  Rapidly deflating prices does cause people to delay purchases.  When DVD players were new, they were $700.  I expected them to come down, and they did.  I finally bought one when it was $200.  I'm currently waiting for a good tablet PC in the $200 range, because that is how much I am willing to spend on consumer electronics that are an option (my desk PC is necessary for the work I do, so I spent more on it).  But delayed purchases are still purchases.  The economy does not freeze up entirely.  It didn't when Bitcoin rose about 20-fold in the early part of 2013.  Some people may have put off things, but others still used it for spending.
If we reach a point of stable adoption levels, and mild deflation, I think Bitcoin will function just fine, and panicky economists will look foolish.

I have been caught by their "Risk API" too, and I represented 3% of their currency trade order book at one point.  I was a major currency trader, making a small profit on the buy/sell spread.  
Unfortunately, since you can buy Linden Dollars with a credit card, it is all too easy to use a stolen card number, then transfer the funds to a different avatar account and cash out.  So their system monitors for unusually large amounts moving too fast, and they also place spending and cash out limits if your account is under a month old.  As a currency trader, I was moving large amounts, so I got caught by the filter.
The owners of Second Life have to balance the wrath of credit card holders whose cards were stolen and used in their world to extract money, and the wrath of legitimate users who simply tried to move too much funds too fast.  Ultimately that dilemma is caused by the low security of credit cards.

The mining algorithm produced 50 coins for the first 210,000 blocks, for a total of 10.5 million, and now 25 coins/block for the next 1.5 million.  Dividing 1.5 million by 25 gives 60,000 blocks, plus 210,000 from the previous period = 270,000.
If you understand mathematical series, it's easy to see the mining formula of 50 + 25 + 12.5 +..... totals to 100 coins.  Since each mining interval consists of 210,000 blocks, then the final total of bitcoins is 100 x 210,000 = 21 million.
Quotes about "the last coin being mined in 2140" may be correct mathematically, but after 6 mining intervals = 24 years, only 1.56% of coins will be un-mined.  The additional coins mined after that point will not materially change the total. At that point mining will generate only 0.78 coins/block, and fees have a good chance to be larger than that.  So in my mind, I call the first 24 years, until 2033, the "coin generation era".  After that comes the "transaction fee era".
4 years/mining interval is only an approximation.  Theoretically we solve 1 block/10 minutes, which is 52,596 per average year.  Thus 210,000 blocks would take 3.9927 years.  But if hash rate is growing, the difficulty adjustments will lag behind, and the average block time will be less than 10 minutes.  So the first mining interval (block 210,000) was completed on 28 Nov 2012, which was only 3.82 years after the Genesis Block.

People put up with poor stores of value, like the Indian Rupee, which has lost an average of 7.5% per year over the last 50 years, so if Bitcoin can reach that level of stability, it will certainly find use as a medium-term store (on the order of years).  For long term stores of value, I would prefer things like real estate, which tend to keep up with inflation of a currency.
But that's just my personal preference.  There doesn't have to be one universal store of value, people can choose on their own which ones they like best.

They are not lost, they are resting peacefully on the block chain.  Nobody can spend them, so they will just sit there.
The actual number of coins in use does not matter.  What you have is exactly 1.0000 block chains representing everyone's balances, and a basket of goods and services that people want to buy and sell.  The market price will adjust according to supply and demand until the bitcoin market capitalization (price x number of coins) is high enough to support the volume of desired transactions.
We could just as well have a quadrillion units or one unit in the block chain, it just moves the decimal point.  Actually, we do have a quadrillion units, since the block chain records transactions in Satoshi (0.00000001 BTC) so it can deal in integers instead of fractions, and avoid rounding errors.  What we call "one bitcoin" is actually 100 million Satoshi, so there are plenty to go around even if lots of them are lost.

bitcoin is a unit of measure, like meters.  Rather than measuring length, it measures the size of balances and transactions on the block chain.  Units which  are uncapitalized, while ones that are named after people have the abbreviation capitalized.  So if we follow SI naming practices it would be "1.12 bitcoins" but "5000 satoshi".

Well, the smart ones would be like my ISP, Comcast, who bought NBC/Universal.  It doesn't matter much to them that I don't pay for TV service, just Internet.  They still make money off me selling bandwidth.  The dumb ones would be like the RIAA, trying to fight the fact that on my low speed tier (6 Mbps down) it takes 6 seconds to download the average song, and my monthly bandwidth allowance is 4 months of new music, even if it was played around the clock.
The cat is out of the bag for distributed payment networks, and existing institutions can either adapt or die.  Adapt would be to use the new networks, and build value-added services on top of them.
What's really going to bake their noodle later on is using bitcoin or similar payment networks for distributed automated production nodes.  Let's say I have a CNC milling machine, and you have a 3D printer, and a third person wants something made.  They can ship out orders to the various fabricators by automated routing to make the parts and pay for them with bitcoin. The parts fabricators ship the parts to another person (near the customer) who does the assembly, and the original customer picks up the finished product by providing a digital signature and payment to identify themselves as the buyer - all without any of the parties knowing who each other are.
How do you tax a business when there aren't the usual invoices and receipts and all that other stuff?  Where they don't even know who their suppliers and customers are?  Sure, you can use a rubber hose on them, but if the paper trail just isn't there, it's hard to defend a particular amount.

I think their problem is in seeing Bitcoin as a coin, like silver and gold can be made into, rather than as an accounting service.  What the Bitcoin network does is facilitate trade or intermediated barter between all the goods and services people are willing to offer to each other.  The network in between just keeps track of balances while value is exchanged among people.
So don't think of bitcoins as things in themselves.  They are just the connectors between real world stuff that people want to trade.

This is not the proper measure to compare to, the stock of narrow money (M1) is a better one:
The one that Fox linked to includes interest-bearing savings account, money market funds, and other such investments.  M1 is currency in circulation plus "demand deposits" (i.e. checking accounts) convertible to currency on demand.  Bitcoin isn't interest-bearing, and functions like cash and sending a check (which is an order to transfer a balance from your account to another person), so I feel that is the better comparison.
On that basis, bitcoin ranks above about 40 nations, approximately even with Maldives.  I say approximately, since the price has fluctuated a fair amount in recent days, so it depends exactly when you quote a price/BTC.

No, as someone who ran several businesses within Second Life and interacted with about 10,000 people in the world over the years, it is a lot more than a few people out of millions of accounts who got caught, including myself.  
Because of the convertibility to dollars and the relative anonymity of accounts, it is all too easy to launder funds or use a stolen credit card number, transfer your Linden Dollar balance to a throwaway anonymous avatar account, and cash it out.  So they have limits on cashing out for new accounts, and a "Risk Monitoring" system for moving unusually large amount too fast.  It is relative to your past history, so I was able to eventually trade and cash out large dollar equivalents.  
It's the people who try to move too much too soon who get caught by the risk filter and then have to call and confirm their details.  I've conversed with their former CFO, and fraud was quite a serious issue for them as a business.  They didn't want to get tagged as a haven for thieves moving illicit money, so they put in limits.  It still happens, of course, just at a tolerable level.

Updating the accounts database is hard to do, but easy to check.  Making it hard to do means it is also hard to fake an entry.  Having it easy to check means everyone can verify it.  The bitcoin protocol rewards the hard work of updating the database by letting "miners" write themselves a transaction entry for 25 bitcoins to their own account.
Miners collect new transactions, then try to form a "block" (a chunk of data) that includes the hash of the previous block, the new transactions, and a number, such that the hash of the new block has a bunch of leading zeroes.  The exact value is set by the current "difficulty".  The chance of any given number producing the right hash value is currently 1 in 21 quadrillion, so it takes a lot of tries to find it.  Without the winning number, though, the bitcoin network will not accept the new block of transactions as valid.  Anyone trying to insert a fake transaction would *also* have to find the winning number, in competition with everyone else on the network, a nearly impossible task.
Since finding the winning number is so hard, most people join "mining pools" that split up the work and split up the payment for the work done.

One thing the math is telling me is that sufficient power to run things is a key to making it all work.  So a solar furnace is early on my list of things to build.

I was responding to the comment before mine, which asked "Does Congress want to tax bitcoin".  Obviously yes, like they want to tax everything else.
You are talking about "tax collections", which is an entirely different question than "legal definition".  Congress writes laws, so along with court interpretation, they *write* the legal definitions.
The IRS does "collections", and indeed, they fail at collecting some taxes, estimated at 20% of the theoretical amounts due.  That includes everything from small businesses who claim questionable deductions, and get away with it, to the underground economy, who simply don't report to the IRS.


They are indeed taxable, if you lose the IRS lottery.  Unlike normal lotteries, if your name comes up for IRS review, you lose money.  They are just unable to audit/review everyone due to lack of staff.  I suspect Republicans in Congress have understaffed the IRS and not funded technology upgrades for them on purpose.  It is a backdoor way of cutting taxes to make them unable to collect them.
Bitcoin just happens to fall into the "hard to track" category, along with cash, barter, and business small enough to be "under the radar".  Thus it is hard to collect on, but still taxable.

"The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, **from whatever source derived**, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration." - *US Constitution, 16th Amendment* (boldface mine)
"From whatever source derived" means they don't care how you made the income, bitcoins, fairy dust, or prostitution - all are taxable if you made money off it.  They don't have to classify it or add a special regulation to cover it, everything imaginable is already covered by the constitutional amendment.  Which part of the tax code applies depends on the circumstances:
* If you mined the coins, and are beyond hobby level, it's business income.  You get to write off your computer hardware, internet connection, and electric bill as expenses.  When you sell the mined coins, that's business income, and your profit is income minus expenses.  If it's a sole proprietorship (you run it yourself, no employees, no partners, no incorporation), it gets added as Schedule C to your form 1040.  I've done this for years with my Second Life Linden Dollar income (a virtual currency).
* If you bought the coins from somewhere, held them for a while, and sell them later for a profit, it's a capital gain, either long or short term, depending if you held it for more or less than a year.
In both cases, you need to have some records to calculate the taxes from.  When I was mining BTC, I kept track of hours I ran my GPU, and I know how much power it draws, so I can calculate the electricity cost from that, if I ever sell my coins.

Right now, for cashing out from another virtual currency (Second Life Linden Dollars) because I'm not making much money in SL any more.  So basically just accumulating coins at the moment.
I have an idea to establish user-defined reserve currency system.  It goes like this: One function of money is a "store of value", but fiat currencies suck at that function, because governments tend to issue too much of it, and the value decreases by inflation.
A user-defined store of value would let you pick your backing for your money.  For example, it could be 20% gold, 50% real estate, 30% bitcoins.  The reserve as a whole keeps enough assets to back everyone's choices, and when one person wants to send funds to another, their balances in the various assets are adjusted as needed.  With a large number of users, the underlying assets will not shift much from transactions, it just becomes an accounting job to keep track of what everyone holds.
This lets everyone back their money how they choose, and transparently convert to someone else's backing when the funds move.  Bitcoin would be one of the options, and how additions and withdrawls from the system are handled.  Otherwise balances just move about within the reserve pool.
You can do this sort of thing today by opening a brokerage account or buying the various assets individually, but that has a lot of fees and complications.  Ideally the reserve pool would do that more easily with less overhead.

According to the CIA Factbook, the combined stock of narrow money (M1, or cash and demand deposits) for all the world's currencies is US $33.2 trillion as of the end of 2012.  At a resolution of one cent ($0.01) that is 3.32 quadrillion units.  Bitcoin has 21 million x 100 million = 2.1 quadrillion Satoshi in theory.  Therefore the current smallest unit should be adequate, even if bitcoin replaced every other currency in existence.
The circumstances where bitcoin might need more resolution would be if the world's economy vastly grew in real terms, or if there was demand for using bitcoin beyond its cash-like M1 function.

Leading edge ASICs require 0.6W/GH.  At current prices, mining generates around $2,340,000/day in new coins.  Assuming reasonably cheap power at $0.10/kWh, that can support 975 MW power consumption (about 1 nuclear plant)
Thus at breakeven on electricity we can support 1.625 billion GH = 1625 PetaHash.  Another way of putting this is electric costs only represent 0.6% of current mining income on a good ASIC.
I'm quite aware there are lots of variables in ASIC efficiency and electric costs, and you need to figure in hardware cost beyond raw electricity, but this gives an order of magnitude estimate.

I see the real question as "who gets to decide if your money is bad?"  I don't think that should be left to any centralized entity.  We have reputation systems, like credit scores, that help you decide if a **person** is a high risk, but ultimately the lender decides if they want to deal with that person, and on what terms.
I would also note that the US Constitution prohibits "bills of attainder" (  ), the tainting of a person for something they had done, such that they, among other things, could not pass property to their heirs.  Declaring certain bitcoins or addresses "tainted" for something a previous owner had supposedly done seems awfully close to this.

Adoption of new communication and software doesn't have to act like a bubble because of Metcalfe's law:  .  The more services that exist, the more reason people have to use bitcoins, and the more users, the more reason people have to set up services.  Utility grows as the square of the trading network.
Little known facts about bubbles: The South Sea Company (  ), the most prominent example of the bubble era in the early 18th century, mostly dealt in government debt, and existed until the 1850's.  The price was only very high for 18 months of it's 140 year existence.  The cause was selling shares of the company to politicians at par, and then talking up the potential for trade with the New World.  The South Sea which the company name refers to, at that time meant South America, which Spain controlled, and which Britain was at war with.  The Company had a government-granted monopoly on trade in that region.  The potential for opening trade was what gave the stock the speculative value above their holding of government debt.
What's important to understand is this company was not a business in the modern sense.  It was chartered by Parliament, given government monopolies, bribed government members, and dealt in government debt.  The speculation in shares was enabled by the government backing of the company, because people believed it could not fail, and in fact did not fail after the bubble.

That is what the NSA Utah Data Center is for:
The whole purpose of that data center is to gather information from various data bases and then correlate them.  Part of the reason for it being where it is, besides being on a military base, is its close to 15 big commercial data centers in the Salt Lake City area.
If you know someone went to a website that accepts bitcoins at X time, and you also know which transactions on the bitcoin network were initiated at that time, you can narrow down who owns a given bitcoin account.  A few more correlations, and you can narrow it to a single person.
I'm sure credit card transactions are a much more fruitful correlation source at the moment, but assigning one server in a million square foot data center to bitcoin monitoring is not going to tax their capacity.

No, it's built on top of the Internet.  A better comparison is the HTTP protocol transfers files, and the Bitcoin protocol transfers value.  Both require the TCP/IP protocol operating at a lower level to function.
I think more important than the use of the Bitcoin protocol for money, as we are doing now, is the concept of irreversible transactions involving *any* kind of stored quantity.  In theory you can tranfer stock shares or deeds to real estate (or fractional interest thereof) in a secure way using this type of protocol.
Today, the official copies of deeds in the US are stored in central databases in county courthouses, mostly on paper.  Transferring ownership involves a lot of cumbersome operations and fees, and tracing the ownership chain of a property is so hard, you have to get insurance against it being incorrect.  A block chain type system would make that much easier.

You are not getting it.  Adding new transactions to the permanent history of bitcoin's database (the block chain) is purposely made hard, so that it is hard to fake.  If you wanted to insert a fake transaction, it would need to be in a solved block that included the transaction.  Since everyone else is including only legitimate transactions, you need huge amounts of computer power to solve a block faster than the rest of the network combined.
Why is a fake transaction not included by other people?  Because it fails either in not having a proper private key signature, or not having enough bitcoins to spend.  The signature can be checked in the transaction itself, and the current balance of the sender can be found from the past history of the block chain.
The mechanism of making new entries hard is to require the hash of a new block to be below a value set by the current difficulty.  The incentive is the block reward, where the first entry in a block is the miner awarding themselves newly generated bitcoins (25 currently), plus any transaction fees from the included transactions.  Since the destination address of every miner claiming the reward is different, they are searching for different inputs (nonces) which will generate the right kind of hash value.  Their address is part of the block, and hash values are random outputs based on the inputs, so there is no way to find a sufficiently low hash value except by trying different nonces till you find the right one.

With physical wallets you had to learn not to leave it unprotected on the table when dining in a restaurant, and not to have it in an accessible pocket in a crowd (pickpockets).

The advice other people are giving are good.  Significant bitcoin balances should not be left with third parties, get it under your control, and offline.

Nodes in the bitcoin network are people running a full client like bitcoin-qt, which verifies a new transaction has enough inputs (funds) to spend before forwarding that transaction to other nodes.  For small transactions, buying a cup of coffee is the usual example, it is sufficient for the transaction to arrive across the network. The person is unlikely to attempt something fishy when they are right in front of you, and the network nodes have checked the sender had enough funds to send.
Miners attempt to form "blocks" from the pool of valid but unconfirmed transactions.  This is intentionally hard, so that not just anyone can insert a block into the permanent history of bitcoin transactions (the block chain).  It requires the collective effort of the world's 500 fastest supercomputers times four in processing power to form new blocks at present.  That amount of work ensures that nobody else will write the permanent transaction history.
Each block includes the hash of the previous block as part of its data, so blocks are chained together in the order they were created.  If you changed even one data bit in a past block, that block and every one after it becomes invalid.  So the more blocks that arrive after the one with your transaction, the more certain it becomes that transaction will be permanently accepted by everyone.  Six confirmations (blocks including the transaction plus ones after it) is generally accepted as being so hard to change, you can use it even for very important transactions.
How many confirmations to wait before finishing your deal is up to you. If I was running a business, I would adopt a rule like log(base10) of the transaction dollar value rounded down to the next integer.  That would be 0 confirmations for under $10, 1 for $10-100, etc, but you can use whatever you feel comfortable with.

tl;dr - Internet cash.
The Bitcoin system includes a public shared ledger of transactions called the "Block Chain", where a block is a set of transactions validated with a checksum (hash value) that shows the contents have not been changed.
It also includes a network of "nodes" that relay new transactions via peer-to-peer connections.  Some of the nodes also try to validate and publish new blocks.  They get rewarded for maintaining the bitcoin "account book" with newly generated bitcoin units (the spendable currency).
Lastly are downloadable software, smartphone apps, websites, etc. that let people use this network to send bitcoin transactions to each other.  Secret cryptographic keys are used to digitally sign transactions, and they are stored in a digital "wallet".  Only someone with the key can spend the bitcoins at a given address.  The user software mostly hides the actual keys (they are long strings of numbers and letters), it just accesses your wallet file when you want to send a transaction.
There is no central organization like a bank or PayPal that runs bitcoin.  It's distributed peer-to-peer transfers and validation.  So anyone can use it.  It's also still in beta, the official user software is at version 0.85.

It's called the wealth effect.  It happened with rising home values before the recent recession.  When people have more wealth, they feel comfortable spending some of it.  The measured effect was about 5% of the increase in home values.
Due to the drop in home values in the last recession, this worked in reverse.  People feel poorer, so they spend less.  That made the recession deeper and longer lasting than it otherwise would, on top of the drop in construction/real estate related sector of the economy.  The latter was because during the rise in value and easy financing, we built too may fucking houses and buildings.  We stopped building and put lots of people out of work:

The fundamental use of bitcoin is to buy and sell stuff.  What I think will limit it's adoption is the cap on block size.  This limits us to 576,000 transactions a day.  This is ten times the current transaction rate, but is far from enough to handle global transaction volume.  If the block chain caps out in volume, and people cannot complete transactions they want to do because there is no more room, then bitcoin use will stall.
We don't want the block chain to grow infinitely in size, because then nobody could verify it or store it.  So the way forward that I see is either parallel or branching block chains.  Parallel chains are essentially separate currencies, although they may use identical rules and software to the original block chain.  Branches make contact with the main block chain at one or more points, but operate separately the rest of the time.  In both cases they have their own history and miners.
I'm not smart enough to figure out the details of how the various chains would interact, but I can see the problem of finite capacity on the current version of bitcoin, and it is not that far away the way things are growing.

Bitcoin is the *third* virtual currency I have been involved with, and I have made money on all three.  In fact I bought some of my first bitcoins with Second Life Linden Dollars.  The value proposition of the Bitcoin network is it lowers friction in financial transactions, and increases security and privacy.  For that reason, I think it will continue to gain users.  Since the number of units in the accounting database (i.e. BTC) is growing slowly and has a fixed limit, the exchange rate per unit will go up as the number of users and transactions go up.  The bumps up and down in the exchange rate are just noise.

I have a different theory - that bitcoin was written by spooks, for spooks.
Consider that money laundering is coming under increasing scrutiny by agencies like Treasury and Homeland Security, but the CIA wants an untraceable way to fund what they do.  So they ask the NSA to come up with a secret way to transfer funds.  Their cryptographers, generally considered the best in the world, write the paper and first version of the code.  Of course they needed to cover their tracks, and used a pseudonym.
In Japanese, the family name comes first, so it is Nakamoto Satoshi.  Nakamoto means "Central Region", and Satoshi means wise or Intelligent, thus "Central Intelligence".  The first letters of the name spell "N..Sa" or "NSA".  My guess is a mathematician on the team could not resist putting the clues in, and the agency brass never caught on.  They just thought the name was sufficient misdirection, especially when written the American way as Satoshi Nakamoto.
Satoshi seemed so smart because it was actually a front for a team. Another clue is the forum post times line up with US office hours.
My theory may be entirely wrong, but it seems to match the facts.

I look at it as a network of people with real goods and services to trade.  The block chain and bitcoin apps are just the secure accounting system we use. It enables us to trade with each other, even if we never meet and don't trust each other.  As long as we trust the network to record transactions without tampering, we can use it as a trading mechanism.
In this view, the value of all the account balances in the block chain will be proportional to the flow of real transactions between people.  As more transactions happen against a relatively fixed supply of total balances, the demand for balances goes up.  What we call a "bitcoin" is just the nominal unit in the block chain, so as the overall demand for balances increase, so will what people trade for a unit fraction of the total block chain balances.

You can only measure inflation and deflation by comparing currency prices in terms of other goods.  Let's look at the cases of computer processor power and network bandwidth.  The dollar and other national currencies have been rapidly deflating relative to those goods, since it takes less and less currency to buy a unit of them.  
Do people hoard dollars and not buy computers and networking because they can get them cheaper later? Obviously not.  They have present utility, so people buy them.  The same argument holds for a currency as a whole.  When the present utility of a purchase exceeds that of holding the currency, the currency will be spent.
I will give a personal example.  I want to buy a house in the near future, and am saving both dollars and bitcoins towards that end.  If the price of bitcoins rises to the point they can help make that down payment, I'm going to spend the coins.  I really want a house, and would prefer to get it this year rather than next year.  It would be nice to hold coins until they reach some ungodly high price, but I have other desires besides a big theoretical balance.

Bitcoin has utility value, and exchange value.  They are independent of each other.  Utility depends on things like the software and network, and how many places accept it for payments.  Exchange value depends on how often they are traded relative to the volume of goods and services.
If there are 11 million bitcoins in circulation, and they are each used once to pay for $1.1 billion of goods and services (including other currencies), then they were each worth $100 in trade.  If those same bitcoins were used ten times each to pay for the same goods, then they must have been worth $10 each in payment.
If we divide both sides by time, the relationship still holds, and we get $1.1 billion/year in spending, and number of times per year the currency is used.  In economics, times/year is called "velocity" of a currency.  If people hold onto their bitcoins longer, and the volume of goods and services per year stays the same, then the value/BTC must necessarily go up.
If the number of units stays the same (which will be more true over time) and the holding time stays the same on average, but the volume of trade increases, then the value/BTC must again go up.

Polish history humor:
A Pole finds a magic lamp and rubs it.  Out pops a genie, who grants him three wishes.  His first wish is for the Mongols to invade Poland.  The genie gives a quizzical look, but grants the wish, and Mongols then invade Poland.  The genie then asks what his second wish is, and again he asks for Mongols to invade Poland.  Finally, he is asked what his third wish is.  Yet again he asks for the Mongols to invade Poland.
The genie says "I have to ask, why did you wish for the Mongols to invade Poland three times?".  The Pole replies "Because on the way they will trample Russia six times."

If you are referring to Ron and Shamir's paper ( at page 7 where the 78% figure is quoted, you should note that the cut-off date of that study was 13 May 2012, 11 months ago.  
Prior to that date, transaction volumes were much lower than they are now.  There were simply less things to spend bitcoins on.  I estimate that 60% of total transaction volume ever made has come *after* that study was completed.  Thus any conclusion they made at the time about how many coins are in circulation vs held is no longer valid.  You would need to redo the study *today* to see how many coins have not moved since arriving at a fresh account.
In any case, the fraction of coins not in circulation is irrelevant.  Let's say half are not being used for spending.  For the purpose of currency supply, that is exactly the same effect as if the block rewards were half as much and coins generated in total were half as much.  Bitcoins are arbitrary units, so their price is set by supply and demand.  Demand is set by how much stuff people want to trade for bitcoins, and the value of (available coins x price per coin) will adjust to that demand, no matter how many coins are available.


In other words, currency in circulation.


National Merit Scholar in mathematics, a physics degree, and a career in aerospace engineering disagrees with your assessment of my math skills.  My checkbook almost always balances too :-).  I'm afraid not considering the volume of transactions in the early days vs now is where you have gone astray.  If bitcoin was a steady-state economy, a year old study would still be valid.  It is not steady-state, it's exponentially growing, so recent volume is much more important.

Now add in the idea that value is subjective, and different for each person, and you might be getting somewhere.
Further add in the idea that scarcity depends on circumstances.  Air isn't particularly scarce in most cities at sea level, but at passenger airplane altitudes or when diving underwater it certainly is, and people pay for having air under those conditions.  In a passenger airplane, it is built into the cost of the ticket to supply cabin air at breathable pressure and comfortable temperature.  For divers, they have to pay for filling their tanks

You would be about 1.25 seconds behind Earth's transaction data, which might make you a bit uncompetitive, but still within mining range.  300 light seconds would put you half a block behind, thus bitcoin mining at that distance would not work so good.

That's why I am designing Seed Factories to be owned by the local community who builds them.
@_date: 2013-10-15 22:27:27
That's my project: 
We intend to have 3D printers as part of the factory, but one machine cannot do all the materials and processes needed.  So instead we have a collection of machines that can make parts for each other, and collectively copy themselves.  Since it's a bunch of machines rather than one, and bigger than a garage, we call it a "factory".
One of our designs is a "Distributed Factory", where each person owns one or a few machines, which can collaborate to make something.  Payment for machine time and materials would naturally be via bitcoin escrow.
The centralized version, where all the machines are in one place, would have multiple owners, who could request stuff be made for them in proportion to their ownership share.  We did a fundraiser on Bitcoinstarter (  ) and we are holding the coins for those contributors to eventually become their share of the factory.
We are starting to look for a location near Atlanta to build and test our prototypes.  So the day you mention hopefully isn't that far away.

If you are paid for work with "something of value", it is taxable as "payment in kind".  If you exchange bitcoins for someone else's work, it is a barter transaction.  If you mine or buy bitcoins, and later sell them at a profit, it is capital gains.
Bitcoin itself may be new, but categories of transactions it falls under are old.  It is far from the first time people have traded things besides fiat cash for other things, and the IRS wants to tax it.
Now, ability to track bitcoin transactions to tax them is an entirely different subject.  It falls in similar difficulty as cash under the table.  Legal liability for taxes, and ability to collect them are not the same thing.

Online micro-payments.  Transactions that are too small for the normal payments system to deal with. The tip bot here on reddit is an example. 
I have participated in the Second Life virtual world for nearly 7 years.  The greatest invention they made there was a convertible game currency - it could be bought and sold for dollars on an exchange. Their greatest stupidity was not exploiting that idea beyond their own little world.  The ability to profit from small transactions unleashed a flood of creativity.  There are literally millions of game items you can buy within Second Life.
Now apply the idea of small transactions for online items across the whole rest of the internet.  How big could that be?  Maybe I want to buy $5 of Apple stock.  Try doing that today and you get killed on commissions.  With bitcoin, you send it off and an intelligent broker will allocate a fractional share for you for a microscopic fee.

It can also result in secondary services which "aggregate" transactions.  Instead of 1000 people submitting transactions to the main chain,  they submit transactions to a collection system, which then sends one big transaction to the main chain, representing the sum.  The details about the amounts go over separate communications channels to other aggregators, who then distribute as needed to their customers.  This is not as pure a system as "One big account book for the whole world", but it can scale better.
Aggregators can run their own block chains internally to keep a similar level of verification and public history.

The reason I think it is possible, is that a single start-up company has limited time and brains to capture a chunk of the market.  Bitcoin is an open-source protocol and network, and thus has many people able to do their bit.  It also does not need to beat the best competitor, only the bottom worst 1% competitors, which I think is very feasible.
I admit, that my calculation above is a "maximum potential" kind of calculation.  Doing the opposite, we come up with a zero valuation.  That can come from:
* Government shutdown of exchanges
* A crack in the protocol or network
* A better system is built to replace it
People should be aware it can go either way, and current price is not a prediction of the future.  I personally think the upside is greater than the downside, and I do have a personal "OK, that's high enough, time to cash out" point.

@_date: 2013-05-13 16:21:26
It is solving a useful problem: the prevention of double-spending for a distributed electronic currency.  Anyone with a hacked bitcoin client can ship off duplicate transactions to different people, spending the same coin balance twice.  To prevent that from working, the network has to agree that one of the transactions came first, and the other is invalid.
The way bitcoin does that is group new transactions into a "block", with a difficult to find checksum (hash).  It needs to be difficult to find, otherwise the person doing the double-spending could fake the block, along with their fake second transaction.  The difficulty is designed so that the whole network attempts to find the right kind of hash, and you cannot predict who will find it first.  The network accepts that the longest chain of blocks is the true history of transactions, since the most work by the network went into making it.
Your bitcoin balance in a given account is simply the sum of all past transactions in and out of that account number.  So once a spend from that account is recorded in a block, any attempt to spend it again will not work, since everyone can calculate your current balance and see it is too low.

Inflation is measured relative to the size of the economy.  If the amount of goods and services and the amount of currency grow at the same rate, then you expect the prices of things (i.e. the exchange rate of the currency for goods) to be constant.
Thus once the growth of the bitcoin supply becomes less than the growth of the world economy as a whole (~3-5%) it is no longer inflationary on a world economy basis. Nominal currency growth is now 11%/year and falling. Actual currency growth depends on how many people are mining, but it stays reasonably close to the nominal level.  By the next reward halving, in 3 years, the nominal rate will be 4.17%, and it will no longer be inflationary.
But bitcoin is not the world's currency.  The economy it is measured against is the set of people who use bitcoin to buy and sell stuff, including other currencies.  That economy has been growing at more like 1000% a year, thus bitcoin is very *deflationary* relative to it's own economy.

No, it's not *like* a lottery, it *is* a lottery.  The prize is worth $16,250 and is awarded on average every ten minutes.  Every attempt at hashing is an entry.  It's a lot more than 10 million, though, the network churns through 5.2 million trillion hashes to find a new block.  That number is so absurdly large, that most miners are in pools that combine their hashing power and split the reward when they get it.  If you don't have custom mining hardware these days, even with a pool you will earn negligible amounts.
Miners are purposely forced to look for a hard-to-find hash (checksum) of recent transactions.  This process is called "proof of work", because if you find the hash, a lot of work went into it.  The difficulty of finding the hash is automatically adjusted every two weeks so that the whole network finds one hash every ten minutes on average.
The point of all this hard work is to make the history of bitcoin transactions very hard to change.  If you change any transactions in a set with a hash (which we call a "block" of transactions), the hash will also change, and the work to find a valid hash would have to be repeated.  Since the whole network was involved in finding the hash the first time, there isn't enough computer power lying around to redo the work, thus the block remains unaltered.
Further, each block also includes the hash value result from the *previous* block in its contents.  So if you changed an older transaction in an older block, you would have to redo the work of every block after it, because each changed block also changes the contents of the next one.  The linked blocks is why we call the whole thing the Block Chain.
An unchangeable record of transactions is very important for a digital currency.  A hacker can't just go in and edit a bitcoin transaction to give themselves money.  First of all, it's decentralized, there are many copies of the block chain.  Second, every instance of the full bitcoin software checks the whole history on it's own.
Since mining is hard, there needed to be some incentive to get people to do it.  The creator of bitcoin decided the way to do that was to allow the miner who finds a block to pay themselves some newly created bitcoins.  That's how they come into the system - as reward for making the history secure.

Extracting useful information from multiple data sets has a long history in astronomy and space missions, where you use different wavelengths or different types of sensors.  That is "spacial correlation", where you are matching up readings from the same place in the sky, or location on the surface of a planet.  Traffic analysis matches things on more than just location.  You can use the time dimension, on the principle if things happened at the same time, they might be related.

I would list bitcoin mining as "Accounting services", because that is what you are actually doing - helping to maintain the transaction history.  The pool payments are your income (or block rewards if you are mining on your own).  Your hardware, software, and utility costs are legitimate business expenses.  Whatever your net after expenses is business income or loss.
There isn't a need to create a new category for bitcoin, because tracking accounts and their balances is not a new idea, it's as old as accounting.  The fact that it's all computerized and distributed is new, but not the task you are doing.  Since there are plenty of bitcoin exchanges, the value of the account balances is easily determined in your local currency. The accounts being in arbitrary units called "bitcoins" then is not a problem, just convert to dollars or whatever and do your income and expense calculations from there.

The idea is instead of everyone storing a full copy of the block chain, you store a subset, and access the remainder by a peer-to-peer network similar to bittorrent.  If there 1000 nodes, each storing 10% of the block chain, that means there are a total of 100 copies, which is enough redundancy to verify integrity.
The number of copies can be optimized for speed and bandwidth.  For example, recent blocks with unspent outputs could be stored with more copies or by everyone, while old blocks that are less likely to be needed can be stored less often.

I have news for folks, profits from Second Life were always taxable.  Any US person who ran a serious business there reported it or ran the risk of fines and penalties if they were discovered, the same as any other unreported income.
The US Constitution says they can collect taxes on income "from whatever source derived", so from a legal standpoint it does not matter where it comes from or how you made it.
There are only practical questions about whether the transactions are reported or traceable, and if the amounts are big enough for the IRS to bother going after.  Since an estimated 18% of US income is unreported (illegal or off the books), they have bigger fish to catch at the moment than most bitcoin tax evaders.

It seems like the conventional financial system has forms of memory too.  Your bank knows the past transactions in your accounts, and your credit history shows the past transactions with lenders.  Then the question becomes how is bitcoin different?
I would say the conventional system takes effort for third parties to see the past actions.  A random merchant does not know your bank account history, and thus the likelihood your check will be good.  You have to provide them with copies of your statements if you want to prove your history to them.  It costs a non-trivial amount to access a credit history and thus decide whether to do business with you or not.
Bitcoin makes it easy to check the past history of any account number, and with a small effort (signing a message with their private key) prove you own the account.

No, I do what I do because of the opening scene of the original Star Wars movie (1977).  I wanted to build the Imperial Battle Cruiser, after seeing how huge it appeared to be chasing Princess Leia's ship.  The following year I visited Dr. Gerard O'Neill's lab at Princeton.  He popularized the idea of space colonies, and was building an electromagnetic accelerator (mass driver) in the lab.
I was a physics student at Columbia University, and by 1981 I presented a paper at one of the Princeton Space Manufacturing conferences hosted by O'Neill (  , next to last paper in that session - Dani Eder is me ).  I sent a courtesy copy of my paper to Dana Andrews (2nd paper in the same session), who could not attend the conference.  That led to an interview and a job at Boeing, where I worked in their Space Systems Division.  I recently reached retirement age, so now I work for myself, but still doing space-related engineering.

The reason I'm working on the automated factories is even with cheaper space launch, we can't bring entire factories to the asteroids or the Moon.

They are a payment processor, they take bitcoin payments, and send your business local currency, as often as daily.  Therefore they don't keep much bitcoin balance.  They have to sell it for currency as it comes in.  I assume they are set up with multiple exchanges to sell the bitcoins and get local currency to pay their merchants.
So unless they are dumb, they are not exposed much on bitcoin price changes.  Where their buffer would be is in local currencies, to cover the time it takes the exchange to deliver their funds, so they have those funds to forward to the merchant accounts.

It would require a change to the software, because blocks are currently limited to 1 MB each, which limits the transaction rate to about 4000 per ten minutes.  The coins themselves are fine, since there are 2.1 quadrillion "satoshi" available in theory.  That is 1 satoshi = 0.00000001 BTC, the smallest unit the current system keeps track of.
If the transaction rate stays limited to keep the block chain from growing infinitely in size, then third parties can act as brokers to collect transactions into larger units.  An example of how this can be done is  .  They hold physical gold in the form of bars in a vault, and shares in the fund represent about 0.1 ounces each.  So the shares are a smaller and more tradable unit than the gold itself.
With bitcoin, brokers can aggregate their customer orders into one transaction on the block chain and keep a combined balance for all their customers together.  People can even pool their efforts into a secondary block chain that operates the same way the main one does, with crypto security etc.  and which links up to the main block chain periodically to do one combined transaction.
This isn't the only way to deal with a massively larger user base, there are other approaches.

The "market cap" or "bitcoin money supply" (US$ 380 million) is simply the number of coins in circulation (10.856 million today) times the market price in fiat currency ($35).  Since the coins in circulation is changing slowly (1.175% per month during February), the change in market cap is almost entirely due to the change in market price.
Therefore your statement has it backwards, it's not the market cap that is driving the value of the coins, its the exchange rate for the coins that is driving the market cap.  In turn, the exchange rate is simple supply and demand.  More people want to hold and use bitcoins against a relatively fixed supply.  Therefore the price goes up until supply and demand are in balance.
On a side note, since bitcoin is used as a currency, it is equally valid to say the value of the dollar has crashed in bitcoin terms.  The dollar economy is larger at the moment, but the bitcoin supply is now equal to that of the nation of Lesotho, the 26th smallest nation in terms of M1, so it is already in the ranks of national currencies, and larger than 13% of them.
The sum of all world money supplies is US$33.2 trillion, thus bitcoin has a 0.00114% market share.  The world money supply number here is cash and demand deposits, which is the most similar to how bitcoin works.  The world financial system has other flavors of money and assets which are larger but less spendable.

The same carrier airplane used to launch the passenger rocket is planned to launch small satellites into orbit.  You trade off payload size for velocity.  Since the takeoff weight of the airplane is fixed, you can only handle a certain weight of rocket:
Stratolaunch is using the same concept, and the same airplane builder (Scaled Composites) but a much bigger carrier airplane - it's made of parts from two used 747's.  That one can deliver a useful payload to the Moon, like a robotic rover.  Even that isn't big enough to send people to the Moon.  The Saturn V Moon rocket was about 4-5 times heavier, and in conventional rocketry, take off weight and fuel load determines the delivered payload:

This is incorrect.  If you consider bitcoins a barter item rather than a currency, their value is still counted as income.  If someone gives you a share of apple stock, or a pig, or a bitcoin for painting their house, it doesn't make any difference in the eyes of the IRS.  You value it at the market price at the time you got it, and are supposed to report it as income.
The fact that 18% of US income goes unreported means a lot of people *don't* report their earnings, but the IRS will still want to tax it if they can find it.

Actual exchange volume for the first quarter of 2013 averaged US$ 2 million (  ) and average price over that period was about $30.  Thus 67,000 BTC/day were flowing into and out of exchanges, while block chain total volume was 300,000 BTC/day.
Exchange trading volume is a different number than block chain volume for active traders, because they keep their money on the exchange.  Day traders and HFT bots don't take money out of the exchange because there isn't time to move the funds.  They just exchange national currency to BTC and back within their exchange account. Thus that activity does not show up on the block chain, any more than bets on a poker site that stay within the site do. 
Arbitrage between exchanges also takes too long to move national currency.  What you would need to do is have balances on both exchanges so you can execute simultaneous trades when the spread is big enough to make a profit.
Merchant servicing, such as bitpay does, is another matter.  They take BTC and deliver local currency to the merchants, so they have to dispose of the BTC, which I assume is on an exchange.  This may be double counting (it depends how bitpay sets up their accounts), but it represents real economic transactions.

"no one buys computers — because whatever you want to buy is sure to become cheaper in a few months."
Do people see the flaw in the reasoning?
People spend when the utility of spending is greater than the utility of holding.  The utility of having food, shelter, and electricty right now is almost always high enough that people will spend today, regardless of the future.  That kind of spending for current needs will keep the economy operating.
People also like to save for their future, when they might be too old to work, or just to have fun in retirement.  So they set aside a portion of their money for the future.  The "real return" on any investment is the nominal return minus inflation.  If inflation happens to be negative (deflation) than the real return will be higher than the nominal return, but the relative returns of cash vs other investments stays the same, because the inflation adjustment affects everything equally.  So people will have exactly the same incentive to buy stocks and bonds, or real estate vs holding cash as they had before.
Thus the deflation is bad argument is completely specious.  People will still spend and invest.

The market cap of litecoin is about $70 million ( or about 1/20th of bitcoin.  This can be explained by the nearly 3 year head start for bitcoin.  It simply has had more time to develop a network of users, applications, and merchants.
Part of usefulness for a payment system is places to use it.  Credit cards when they were first introduced could only be used at a few restaurants.  Therefore they only had utility for people who ate out a lot on business.  They benefited from having one monthy bill to submit to their employer instead of a stack of receipts, or their employer gave them a card for the same reason.
Today, credit and debit cards are accepted almost everywhere in the US, so they have much more utility.  For new systems like bitcoin and litecoin, it takes time to build a network of places that accept them, so it's unfair to compare them to systems that have been around for much longer.

Individual accounts are not really how banks make money.  They are merely the raw materials from which they make loans.  Loans and leverage are the major source of income.  A well run bank might make 2% margin on loans, after paying depositors and all other expenses.  But their own bank capital might be only 1/8 of the loan amounts, so they end up making 16% return on their own capital.
Banks make money by using Other People's Money (OPM), namely yours.  Bitcoin is an existential threat to banks, because they no longer would have your money to lend out.  I suppose someone could eventually set up a banking operation using bitcoins instead of dollars/euro/whatever, but everyone would know the state of the bank's finances at any moment.  They could not hide their mistakes any more.

In the long term, the mining reward goes down, and you are left with just transaction fees.  The exchange rate for one bitcoin has grown dramatically this year, but a little math shows it can't grow that much for more than two years:
Current price/coin = ~$600, giving market cap of ~$7.2 billion.  This is up by a factor of 50 since a year ago.  Two more years at that rate would result in 2500 x $7.2 billion = $18 trillion, which is about the size of the whole world's money supply.  It should be pretty evident that the whole world will not adopt bitcoin in two years, thus the mining reward will have time to decrease the incentive to mine.
For example, in two years we would be about a year away from the next halving of the reward.  So people buying mining hardware would have to figure in that reduced reward in their decision to buy more hardware.

I don't think the bulk of bitcoin users know enough about it to take the decrease in mining rewards into account.  Miners (of which I am a casual one) certainly know about it, and the more interested people who have read up on it, but for rest, I don't think so.

It doesn't matter what amount you use, if the value of one BTC rises dramatically the nominal amount can end up being more than the item itself.  The only solution I see is for the transaction being the actual payment for the item, and then the sales contract references the transaction as proof of payment as an addendum.  
You can't do the transaction before the contract, because the seller could just walk away with the payment.  So it would need to be in the form "I promise to pay X" at the top of the contract, then a space lower down to fill in "Payment completed via transaction Y", with signatures by both parties.
If the transaction is the actual payment, then it doesn't matter what the value of bitcoins does afterward.

The BitNet (bitcoin network) provides a useful service - moving value from place to place, in the same way that delivery trucks do for physical goods.  The only way to use the network is via balances on the block chain.  So demand to use the network creates demand for balances, which we measure with the "bitcoin" unit.
Bitcoin as a currency unit has no existence or usefulness without the Block Chain to record transactions, network nodes to relay them, miners to create new blocks, and user software and apps to generate transactions.  All of these collectively form the network.

I use a capital when referring to Bitcoin (the network) and lowercase when referring to bitcoins (the unit of measure on the Block Chain). The first is a "thing", thus a proper noun, and gets capitalized.  The second is a measurement, and thus lower case like meters, unless the unit is named after a person.  So the smallest unit on the Block Chain is called a "Satoshi" like we capitalize Watts and Joules (all named after somone).

You missed the bus, it left over the summer.  
Because bitcoins have been increasing in value, people have been moving to more specialized hardware in order to mine more of them.  At first (2009) people use used CPUs to do the calculations.  Then they moved to graphics cards, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA's), and now Application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).  ASICs are custom chips that do nothing but bitcoin mining.  Since the whole chip can be devoted to this one task, they are very fast at it.  Once these chips started being delivered, the network processing rate went ballistic:
The bitcoin software adjusts the difficulty of mining to maintain a nearly constant rate of new coins being generated.  You can see the adjustments on that chart as the stepped red line, using the scale on the right.  For a given piece of mining hardware, as the difficulty goes up, the number of coins you mine goes down.  At this point, if you don't have ASICs to mine with, you are just wasting electricity, and ASICs are generally back-ordered months in advance.  If you ordered now, by the time they arrive at your door, they will only generate a fraction of the coins they do today.
I mined up until July using my PC graphics card in the background of whatever else I was doing with the PC.  Now I just buy them from an exchange.

If you are pool mining, my understanding is you are sent the header for a potential block.  The header includes a hash of all the transactions in the block (a Merkle root), but leaves out the transactions themselves.  Your ASICMINER then attempts to find a sufficiently low hash of the header by trying nonces.
So your internet connection needs to be fast enough to get updated headers and send back completed "shares" (low hashes, but not low enough to solve the block, they are proof you worked for the pool).  If you are too slow, you will have more "stale" shares, meaning by the time you return a completed share, the pool has moved on to a new header or new block.
(Please correct this if it's wrong, my experience was from being in a mining pool, but I only have a layman's understanding of it.)

This study quantifies the fact that the majority of most large corporations' ownership is represented by "Institututional Investors", who are organizations like mutual funds and retirement funds.  Take any big corporation, like Google and you can see that:
As an individual who invests in the mutual fund, or benefits from the retirement fund, you get a financial return, but you have no control over the corporation.  The fund manager gets to vote the shares in any matters that come up, elect the board of directors, and have the ear of the corporate management.  
When you see banks listed in the top institutional holders, like JP Morgan Chase &amp; Company listed as holding 2.39% of Google's stock, that is not the bank itself which owns it mostly, but the bank-run investment funds and brokerage for it's customers.  Again, to the extent the bank votes the shares, they have control over the corporation, even if they don't legally have ownership.  This control is magnified when the bank is also the financier for corporate bonds and issuing new shares of stock.
Even though institutional investors are based world-wide, pretty much all the big ones have offices in the Wall Street area, even if they are not headquartered there.  So you can refer to the group as a whole as "Wall Street" as a shorthand.  The top people tend to know each other, and pretty much all have the same goal: "Make More Money".  So even if they don't conspire to take over the world, their common goal makes them act collectively as if they do.
I do not agree with the post titel.  Wall Street is perfectly capable of buying bitcoins for a hedge fund, or creating bitcoin derivatives, just like they do for any other commodity or currency.  Bitcoin until now was just too small and thinly traded to be worth much attention at the institutional level.  I suspect individual Wall Street people have taken an interest, and when bitcoin gets big enough, the institutions will make a market in it, because that's what they do.  Their security will probably be better than some of the bitcoin exchanges, because they have been dealing with money a lot longer, but their fees will probably be higher.  The very openness of bitcoin means you cannot keep Wall Street out if they want to participate.

Bitcoin is a secure distributed accounting database which records transactions between people and lets everyone audit the account balances.  The value is based on the usefulness of this kind of database, and the volume of real goods and services people are willing to trade using it.
If nobody is willing to use it to record real transactions, the value is zero.  If lots of merchants use it because they save on credit card fraud and fees, and if lots of individuals use it to save on money transmission fees, the demand for transaction balances will make "one bitcoin" worth a lot.
Note that bitcoins don't exist as discrete entities.  They are just numbers representing movement of balances from one account to another.  The numbers can be any fractional amount down to 0.00000001 BTC (1 Satoshi).  Their value arises from the expectation you can trade your balance later for a real good or service.  The security of the database is key to meeting that expectation.

Calling it a currency obscures what a "bitcoin" actually is.
The "block chain" is just a very large transaction register or account book, which tracks transactions between account numbers in arbitrary units.  In theory you can do the same thing with a paper system, though it would be exceedingly slow.  The Bitcoin software and network is designed to secure the register against tampering by several ingenious methods, one of which is distributing copies to everyone with a full client.  Another is requiring solving a difficult cryptographic problem based on a block of new transactions.  
Being all electronic makes transactions fast, plus the security and privacy and other features has encouraged people to trade their account balances for other goods and services.  But the account balances are still just arbitrary units in a big account book.  So to claim "bitcoin" is illegal I think you have to show one or more of these is illegal:
* Keeping an account book in arbitrary units,
* Trading arbitrary units for other goods and services (including national currencies), or
* Some feature of the software and network.
I can't speak to the laws in India.  Where I live, in the US, those features are legal.  For example, law firms may keep their internal accounts in "billable hours", and convert that later into partnership distributions.  Peer-to-peer data distribution and cryptographic security are quite common online.  So it seems the components are legal here.
Opinions on this line of reasoning?

It is the unit for transactions in the shared account book called the "Block Chain".  The account book is so tamper-proof that people are willing to trade real goods and services for a balance recorded there.  They do this in the expectation they can trade that balance later for something else they want.


tl;dr: The ability to include a transaction sending newly created bitcoins + transaction fees to your own account number.
Mining is the process of adding new pages (blocks) of transactions to the account book.  A block must have a difficult to find checksum (hash) to be valid.  The difficulty forces all the miners to compete in finding the hash, in order to claim a reward of newly created bitcoins, plus any transaction fees from the included transactions.  Because they are all working on the same search, the writing of new pages is turned into a collective effort.
Anyone trying to include fraudulent transactions or counterfeit bitcoins has to compete against everyone else to do it.  The longest chain of valid blocks has had the most collective effort put into writing it, and forms the agreed history of what transactions happened and in what order.

According to blockchain.info (   ), estimated transaction volume in early 2013 is about 300,000 BTC/day. Since about 10.8 million coins existed on average during that interval, the average coin is held for 36 days.
Obviously some coins are held longer than others, but the evidence is in aggregate they are being traded and not just being held onto.  For your claim to be correct, I would expect coins to average a longer holding period, like 6 months or a year.  That would be made of some coins not circulating at all, thus held for years, and others moving in commerce and held a short time, with an average somewhere in between.

Perhaps instead of treating bitcoin as a currency to be manipulated, they should think of it as a reserve like gold, because of the finite amount that can be created.
The IMF is the 3rd largest holder of gold reserves (  ) worth $124 billion at current market.  This represents 1.64% of all the gold ever mined.
They could buy up a similar percentage of bitcoin, and just hold it in reserve.

We were doing that with Second Life Linden Dollars in 2007-2008.  I was half owner of an "escort club", and the sex trade was very popular.  We had different services: avatar sex with text chat, voice, cam, and photos/videos.  The club mainly served as a place to advertise and meet clients.  The girls set their own prices, working hours, and services offered.
The owners of Second Life were under pressure from congress (think of the children!), and in 2009 instituted "Adult verification" to access adult areas.  The decline of Second Live can be dated exactly to the time they announced that would happen.  People liked getting their freak on with an anonymous transaction - buying Linden Dollars only shows up as a game purchase, not that you later used them to pay for live webcam shows.

You misunderstand me.  The landlord has fire insurance on the structure, to protect themselves and their income.  Tenant insurance on their belongings is separate from that.  The landlord's building insurance, like all other costs, are included as part of the rent the tenant pays, so the tenant does not have a choice about paying for fire insurance on the building.
You must live in an awful place to have such an opinion of landlords.  I have owned rental property for almost 30 years, both directly and indirectly through a REIT, and unhappy tenants are counterproductive.  Water leakage causes cumulative damage to the building, so it is in their own interest for owners to fix that as soon as possible.  I will grant you that there are bad landlords, but there are bad business owners everywhere.

The block chain cannot grow without limit because of bandwidth and hard drive space.  So 1 BTC may indeed be worth absurdly large amounts, but regular users won't be doing transactions there.  Larger transactions will pay higher fees to get included in blocks, forcing out the smaller ones.  The end result will be setting up parallel block chains for smaller transactions, and some method of settlement between them and the main one.
This is somewhat like how the  does settlements between national central banks, and the national banks do settlements between local banks.  Otherwise your settlement system has to handle a billion users, which just becomes impractical.
I'm not good enough at math to know if this would work, but one approach to a parallel block chain is buying some amount of standard BTC to start things off, using the same kind of block chain verification, and buying or selling standard BTC to maintain parity of value.  By offloading and aggregating transactions to the parallel chain, you only have to do a few transactions on the main chain to settle up the net change.

Companies like Google dodge taxes by placing ownership of intellectual property in places like Bermuda.  Intellectual property is non-physical, just like bitcoins.  So the tax question becomes who has the ownership rights, and where are they located?
Your wallet file with your private keys gives you control, and thus ownership over some bitcoins.  If you and the wallet file are in a particular country, their tax laws would likely treat them as a domestic asset.  If you set up a shell company in Bermuda, and the wallet is located there and under their control, then it would be a foreign asset, just like Google gets away with.

Is "coin resting time" a better name?  My understanding is the BDD number is the product of number of coins transacted x time since those coins last moved.  Thus 1 BTC which has not moved for a week then is spent, that is 7 BDD.  Coin resting time is then the average time since last spent for a group of transactions, or BDD/volume.
Perhaps a more meaningful number is "coin velocity".  That is the number of coins transacted per time period / coins in circulation.  Looking at the sum of all the exchanges, I see around 2 million BTC/month being traded, thus velocity would be around 0.2/month, or 2.4/year.
Blockchain.info estimates 300,000 coins/day in transaction volume, which works out to about 0.83 velocity/month, or 10 per year.

I didn't mean this to be an explanation for the ZeroHedge people in particular, but more for the general population.
The ZeroHedge commenters seem to be stuck on the first level of understanding precious metals vs paper money, so in their heads "money needs to be backed by something".  But in fact, prior to the formation of the Federal Reserve, when bank notes were nominally backed by gold, you still had banks go bust and their notes become devalued.  The real problem was unsound banking, where they extended too many loans, and didn't have the assets to cover their notes, whether gold, silver, or something else.
Bitcoin doesn't issue notes with a face value or make loans, so it can't get into the same kind of trouble of over-extending itself, or not having enough coverage for its notes.  Instead, a bitcoin balance on the block chain represents the ability to trade for a share of all the goods and services on offer through the network.  That's where I think the real value lies - in those goods and services.  The Bitcoin network just facilitates trading them.

Inside the BitcoinQt software, it actually counts "Satoshi" (0.000 000 01 BTC) as integers.  That avoids rounding errors with floating point numbers.  There are 2.1 quadrillion Satoshi possible, so who cares if half are lost?  A quadrillion money units is still a whole lot.

We need to give them a better description to use instead.  My attempt:
Mining can be described as "accounting services", since what miners do is update the account book where bitcoin transactions are recorded.  They get to include a transaction paying themselves because the network as a whole finds it a useful service.
As far as the mechanics, they are calculating a checksum (hash) on a set of transactions.  It has rare properties (lots of leading zeros), which forces the whole network to work on the calculation, thus ensuring a consensus.

Please keep in mind that "a single bitcoin" has the same level of existence as "a single meter".  It is a unit of measure, not a thing in itself.  Account numbers are the "things" you can get, and have balances which we measure in bitcoins or "Satoshi" (0.01 micro-bitcoin), which are the smallest unit recorded on the Block Chain.  They are like the US cent is the smallest fraction of a dollar normally recorded.
Creating a new empty account number is trivially easy, most programs and websites let you do that.  Wallets hold the keys to one or more account numbers, and the keys are what allow you to spend a balance.  So the wallet and keys are the things you want to make sure you don't lose, just like a physical wallet and keys.  Other people have suggested how to get a balance sent to your account number, so I won't repeat that.

Note: I am not a lawyer, so this is merely legal speculation on what *might* apply:
* Bitcoin does not fit the definition of a virtual currency, to wit: a unit of exchange in a virtual or game world.  It is a unit of exchange in the real world.  Therefore it is more correct to call it a "Private currency" (  ), to distinguish it from government or central bank issued "Fiat currency".  Both are part of the more general class of "Currency".
* In general, any law that deals with money, objects of value, or commercials transactions could apply.  This is a big chunk of the law.  For example, a contract may involve bitcoins, and thus general contract law applies.
* It might fall under finance law as a "Book entry security", in as much as it is a tradable asset which exists in electronic form, except it is not obvious who the "issuer" is.  Conventional securities like a stock share or bond note have an identifiable entity which creates and issues it.  New bitcoins are ledger entries in the distributed account book (block chain), randomly made by whoever happens to solve a block first. They are not issued until that miner first sells the coins, after which they enter general circulation.  Users of bitcoin implicitly agree that all coins are equivalent, no matter who or when they are generated.
* The Foreign Money Claims Act may apply:   This is state law that *some* US states have ratified.
* I have no comment on law outside the US, I simply don't know enough.

Historically the Fed accepts Treasury bonds at face value, because the Fed is a quasi-government agency, and in a sense is accepting it's own debt (really Treasury debt, but Treasury and the Fed work closely).  Meanwhile Federal Reserve Notes (cash) are a liability on their books.  They are non-interest bearing debts.  Treasuries are called Bills, Notes, and Bonds according to maturity.  So when the Fed sells cash to local banks, it is merely exchanging one kind of federal debt for another when it accepts Treasuries in payment.


Nothing.  That's exactly what they did.  The Fed soaked up federally chartered agency debt (Freddit Mac, Sallie Mae, etc.) in order to bail out those agencies and improve their balance sheets.  The Fed took on those bad assets at face value.  How much in principal and interest they get on those securities is unknown, but the economy is improving, so possibly they won't have massive losses.
Since the Fed holds lots of Treasury debt, they earn interest like everyone else who has that kind of debt.  They have other sources of income, so the interest is way more than they need.  The excess interest is simply returned to the Treasury.  If they lose money on mortgage backed securities, it just means they return less excess interest.  So ultimately those losses would add to the federal deficit.  Rescuing the mortgage industry from collapse was seen as more important in the overall scheme of things than whatever they might lose on the deal.

That's higher than the 4 MW I quoted before, because there was a hash rate dip just recently, and the network rate I looked up was at the lower value, I should have used a longer term average.

Thank you again.  Here is the concept:
Conventional brokers charge significant fees to buy and sell investments, and non-liquid ones like real estate have even higher fees.  I propose a user-directed pool with a buffer, so that most transactions don't result in a buy or sell.  Therefore they don't generate commission fees.
To give a concrete example, I already hold shares in a bond fund (  ) which pays a bit over 8% dividends at the moment.  People who wanted to invest in that fund would send me bitcoins, and they would be allocated some number of shares out of those already held.  Only when the shares allocated approaches the number of shares held would a buy order be put in to get more.   When someone wants to sell, they get sent back bitcoins, and the shares go back to the buffer.
Now generalize this to any investment, and people can switch from one investment to another, and as long as the amounts stay within the pool and buffer, there is no commission generated, it's just an accounting item to increase their allocation on one item and decrease it on another.
What I have been building a bitcoin balance for is the buffer between the pool and users.  They will naturally want to send money in, and cash out at times, and I would have to buy and sell some assets as needed for the pool.  So as not to make small buys and sells all the time, I need enough BTC buffer for day-to-day transactions.
Please feel free to critique the idea.

I don't think it is a necessary assumption.  We traditionally assume the medium of exchange and store of value functions both need to be present for a currency to function.  But that's a legacy from commodity money (gold, cattle, etc.).
With modern software and networks we can separate out the "store of value" function.  If you want to store value, buy gold or real estate.  We already make those electronic via Exchange Traded Funds that hold gold, and Real Estate Investment Trusts that hold property.  There is still market friction in buying and selling shares of these assets, but we can fix that.
A currency like Bitcoin can then become purely a medium of exchange, and the rate vs store of value assets allowed to float.
With traditional fiat currency, they attempt to hold the value per unit constant (and often fail), and vary the number of units in circulation according to what they think the demand will be.  With a cryptocurrency like bitcoin, you instead keep the number of units at a predictable quantity, and let supply and demand vary the value per unit in real time, according to actual demand.  I think that's a better approach.

First of all, the average velocity of money is around 10/year.  Thus $8.5 trillion in bitcoin value should be sufficient in theory.  There are 2.1 quadrillion Satoshi possible with the current 8 decimal places, giving us 247 Satoshi/dollar of value.  This should be small enough resolution for ordinary transactions.
In such an environment, trading a whole bitcoin would be like trading a whole bar of gold.  It could happen, but rarely for normal people.  The real problem is not the value per bitcoin or the resolution of the smallest unit.  It is how does the block chain scale to billions of transactions a day.
My own opinion is that it does not.  I think "branch" block chains would get set up with some number of BTC from the main chain, and trade amongst themselves when possible, and settle up across branches using one big transaction to represent many smaller ones.  That way the main block chain grows as the square root of the total number of users, instead of linearly.

No bitcoins are ever lost.  They are still on the block chain.  The wallet that allows them to be spent may be lost, and they are therefore unuseable, but they are still there.
The current limit on smallest currency unit on the Bitcoin network is 2.1 Quadrillion Satoshi, where 1 Satoshi =0.00000001 bitcoins.  This is twice as many pennies as exist in the US M2 (broad) money supply: 
A whole lot of coins would have to become un-useable before it mattered.  Before we reach the point where bitcoin total value was equal to a major currency, it is likely that off-chain transactions, more decimal places, or alternate cryptocurrencies will fill in any lack of bitcoin resolution.


Fewer full bitcoin units.  But each one that remains can increase in value without limit, and we can divide it into smaller pieces than the 100 million Satoshi we do now.

The way to do it is use the same kind of P2P network for bitcoin transactions to carry bitcoin offers to borrow and lend.  If you want to borrow and find an acceptable offer, you send a message to accept it, which generates a bitcoin transaction to send you the funds.
The acceptance may need to meet any number of contractual conditions set by the lender (ie loan terms).

That's not the only reason.  There are also not enough industrial users who can switch on demand when prices are cheap.  Aluminum electrolysis is a good example.  They use very large amounts of electricity, but it can be turned on and off as needed (i.e use off peak power).  In the future, charging electric cars might be a good filler demand for off-peak times.
Negative prices happen because supply and demand are out of balance, but you need to consider both sides of the equation, and adapt both the sources and users to make an optimal mix.  Supply and demand are out of balance because new renewable sources are coming online quickly in some locations, and the demand side hasn't adapted yet.  Negative electric rates, if passed to the users, would be a good incentive to build high electric demand installations, but those take time to plan and build.  We are therefore out of balance in the interim.

Rather than thinking of a bitcoin as a "thing", like a US paper dollar, think if it as a unit of measure for balances on the Block Chain.  Thus we can have millibitcoins, microbitcoins, and Satoshi = 10 nanobitcoins, just like we have millimeters, micrometers, and nanometers.
Currently 1 Satoshi is the smallest unit in the software, which provides enough total units to replace all the world's currencies at 1 US cent resolution.  That's enough for any practical purpose, and if we need more, we can just add more decimals.

What matters is how big the trading network for a currency is, and whether you can find the items you want to buy and customers you want to sell to.  If you can, then you would consider using that currency. It should be obvious the trading network for bitcoin has been growing rapidly, by whatever measures you want to use.

Silly hot dog, of course you can pay for all those things with bitcoin.  These guys have a dollar-denominated debit card, that can be filled with bitcoins (and lots of other methods):
If you have a savings account tied to a checking account, you generally don't worry about the details of how stuff gets moved between accounts.  You just know that the savings account is better somehow for long term storage.  Generally it's done by paying interest on the savings.  But there is no rule that says savings have to be in the same kind of currency as what you spend day to day.  It's usually been that way because the traditional banking system isn't set up to do internal currency conversions between accounts.
Well, enter the magic of software and new business models, and now someone does provide quick and easy conversions.  So you can look for an optimum currency for storage (like bitcoin) and a different one for day to day spending (like dollars) which have more spending outlets.
Your rant is based on the outdated idea that you can only use one currency at a time.  That belongs with the Model T era, where you can have only one color of car.  It's the 21st century, you can have more than one currency at a time.

The author didn't get that mining is "performing secure accounting services" and anything but meaningless.  It's how you ensure the transaction history is legitimate. Think of it this way:  
A paper account book is locked in an electronic safe whose combination changes every time you use it.  In order to make a new entry in the account book, you have to find the new combination by trial and error.  Since this is hard to do, it is hard for anyone to make fake entries.  The legitimate accountants (miners) try new combinations in parallel, much faster than anyone trying to commit accounting fraud.  Their incentive is getting to write an entry addressed to themselves for new bitcoins.

Physical assets like automobiles and houses can still be taxed.  Those are already slightly progressive (luxury tax for autos, homestead exemption for houses).  They can be made more so.


You are assuming the rest of the economy is static, and not developing rapidly.  I am working on self-expanding automation, where part of the output is parts for it's own expansion.  The main output supplies food, shelter, and utilities.  For example, farm robots and automated greenhouses supply food.
Rather than working paid jobs as their main support, people own the automation and trade amongst themselves.  You still need specialized skills - the greenhouse operator is different from the machine shop operator.  Thus people will trade for the things they don't do themselves.  Bitcoin allows automating much of the trading.  If the greenhouse needs a replacement part for it's robot or some fertilizer, it can send out an order automatically, put the payment in escrow, and it gets released on delivery.
In such an economy, people aren't at risk of getting laid off by automation, because they own it, and big corporations aren't as able to skim off profits from the worker's labor.  Please see the book I'm working on for technical details:

You are correct, the "Block Chain" is just a big transaction ledger which tracks movements of balances from one account number to another.

There is nothing wrong with them in theory, although you lose the verification of the block chain, and require trust in a third party if you do that.
An example of off-chain would be a local credit union which has bitcoin accounts for it's members.  Any transactions between members are just settled internally on the credit union books.  Transactions to other locations would still go on the bitcoin block chain.  The real savings accumulates when there are many such off-chain entities.  They can then bundle up all their member transactions into a single block chain payment to the other entity.  The details of who gets paid at the other end are sent as a separate data file directly between entities.
On the plus side, it allows expanding the bitcoin user base without bloating the block chain, and reduces transaction fees.  On the minus side, you add the time for gathering and disbursing transactions at both ends.

My current best guess at the "starter set" of major equipment is described in a in the wikibook being written about the concept:
The photos are just place holders, I don't have detailed designs for the equipment yet.
The metal parts making capability includes a solar furnace for casting (and other purposes), bridge mill, horizontal lathe, and hydraulic press, plus a building to put them all in.
The first machining problem is how big to make the machines, and what attachments will be needed.  I am working backwards from the Phase IA goals (  ), which are to supply part of the food, shelter, and energy needs for one person.  Later phases would attempt to meet more of their needs and for more people.
Once I have nailed down the required outputs, for example a solar furnace that can generate 3.75 kW electric/15 kW thermal, then I can figure out what starter set machine shop and other equipment is needed to build the furnace and other products.  From that, I can work backwards to conventional, non-automated shop tools to build the starter set, and forwards to what "expansion set" is needed for the next phase of production.  I don't think I'm smart enough to get it right the first try, so there will be some iterations of the design.
The goal is to end up with a series of equipment sets, each of which can build parts to add the next expansion set, and also produce an increasing range of end products.

The block chain is a way to securely record and timestamp data.  Bitcoin happens to use it for recording financial transactions, but you can replace the block contents with any kind of data whatsoever and make a record-keeping system.  You can use it to prove ownership of a book or song you wrote by hashing the file, and including that hash as a data entry in a block.  Same goes for contracts, stock shares, or anything else where you want a permanent record.  You can even post secret data to the record system by simply encrypting it before hashing.
The incentive for mining blocks within bitcoin is mainly new coins being generated, but we also have transaction fees.  A generalized record-keeping system can operate purely on fees from the start, and rely on the same distributed hashing to make it secure.  Businesses which need secure record-keeping would be motivated to hash and generate blocks even without fees, since it increases security of their data against tampering.
Your proposal to record stock shares is just an instance of record keeping.  Note that this function on Wall Street is handled by  , which was set up to reduce paperwork in trading stock shares.  The original shares sit in their vault, and they just track how many belong to each broker, who in turn tracks how many belong to each customer.
Anything to do with securities, in the US at least, has to deal with federal and state securities laws.  You would have to either obey them, or go rogue and ignore them.  If you ignore them, you give up enforcability.  In other words, if a stock promoter lies and just runs off with the money, you have no one to turn to.  The whole legal apparatus of courts and securities laws is intended to give you a way to recover from fraud.  If you avoid using them, you need to think hard about how you will prevent fraud, because human nature means people will try it.

Sounds like you don't know how Congress works.  After they have hearings, the committee staffers go in a back room and write up some reports and position papers, and perhaps a draft of legislation.  Then they go shop that around to corporations and campaign contributors.... I mean "constituents", to see what changes need to be made.
Once the staffers are done with their work, the draft legislation gets passed around to other committees, to see if they are stepping on people's toes and try to get some support to introduce a bill.

Sorry, it's not.  You cannot stay updated with the block chain if you are more than 600 light-seconds away (1.2 times the Earth's distance from the Sun).  
You are then prone to literal "man in the middle" attacks.  Someone halfway betwen you and Earth launches a transaction towards Earth, then double spends with you.  By the time you find out about their first transaction, a full block has been processed, and it's too late.
I suppose you can wait for confirmations from Earth before completing a transaction, but that would slow things down a lot.  It would be better to start up a new block chain on Mars (or wherever) and use an interplanetary exchange to move funds between currencies.

The article says to look at the fundamentals, and for a medium of exchange the fundamentals are how much economic exchanging is going on.  
If I look at the USD transaction volume (  ), it has grown exponentially and is now $20M a day.  Other currencies have velocities of 7-10 or so (number of times the money supply turns over in a year).  So $20M a day would support USD 0.75 - 1.0 billion money supply, which is indeed the range we are in.
As long as the transaction volume represents real funds going between people, and is not just trading for speculation or moving balances between accounts just for the sake of moving it around, the fundamentals seem to support the price.

This is correct, but then you have to account for "velocity".  This is an economics unit for money that describes how many times a the money supply is used in a year, i.e how fast the money is moving.
It is found by transaction volume/money supply, which for bitcoin right now is 10 on an annual basis.  Assuming the ratio holds, then with a future volume of e-commerce of USD 250 billion, you would need a bitcoin money supply worth 25 billion to handle that volume.
Interestingly, 10 is also roughly the velocity of the dollar M1 money supply.  Thus the propensity to save vs spend both currencies is about the same on average (individuals will vary widely in their spend vs save habits).

You don't have to hold a full copy of the block chain yourself.  If you have N users who share 100/N of the block chain each on a distributed P2P network, there will be 100 copies total of the block chain.  Users randomly check sequences of blocks to verify them, and when they need to check a particular transaction, they request the correct blocks from whoever has them.  
You can adjust the value of 100 total copies to whatever makes you comfortable that no reasonable action can tamper with the combined history.  You can also use this to check up on centralized hosts, with the distributed copies verifying the centralized copies.

Hash values are not "just" proof of work, they are also a checksum to verify the contents of a block.  Since the previous hash is part of the contents, it also verifies every previous block in a chain back to the origin.  Thus we know the transaction history is correct.
Proof of work makes it hard to write a new block, thus forcing the network as a whole to compete for the reward + transaction fees.  But other proof of work functions can be devised that don't use the hash as the result.  For example, to reduce spam, an email network could issue a challenge of finding the next prime after a very large random number.  For a single email to a friend, doing the calculation is not too burdensome.  But for a spammer trying to send millions of emails, it would be hard.
Using a difficult to find hash as both proof-of-work and as a checksum for the data, as bitcoin does, is an elegant solution.  But it should be understood it is used for two purposes.

I'm working on developing self-expanding automated factories (  ).  One of the example designs is a "distributed factory", where each person owns one or a few machines, but they collaborate to build something.  So it is not just electricity that can be paid for, but production in general, on a demand basis.


That's just an artifact of looking at photovoltaic only.  A proper mix of solar, wind, hydroelectric, and biofuel can balance the supply of each other, and solar consists of Photovoltaic, and solar thermal.  The latter can supply storage in thermal beds, which you can extract later to run a generator.  Solar thermal can also power any industrial process that just needs heat, directly, without making electricity, so it is more efficient.  
Biofuel, because of the long growth cycle, and storability, can bridge the gaps in solar and wind.  Hydroelectric is storable too.  Wind and PV tend to be somewhat complementary - weather fronts have higher winds, but are more cloudy.  If your grid is physically large enough, the power production tends to average out.
Unfortunately, most forum commentaries take a too simplistic view of how electric grids and power consumers actually work, so they reach wrong answers.

On the contrary, here are the locations:
When the US went off the gold standard, the Federal Reserve was forced to hand over the gold they held to the Treasury Department.  In return, they got non-redeemable "Gold Certificates" valued at the rate set by law for gold ($42 and 2/9 or 42.2222/oz).  They still carry those gold certificates on their books as part of the backing for the US dollar.  
The market price for gold is vastly higher than $42 these days, but as there is no way for the Federal Reserve to redeem their certificates for actual gold, they still value the certificates at the price set by law.  Since there is no way to redeem Federal Reserve Notes (i.e. paper dollar bills) unless you are a bank, in practice it doesn't matter.  The Treasury holds gold worth $337 billion at current market prices.  That is a sizable fraction of the currency in circulation.  The remainder of the backing is Treasury bonds and mortgage securities, which in turn are based on the government's ability to tax, and the underlying value of the real estate that is mortgaged.
So the US dollar is backed by "stuff", but the quality of the "stuff" may not be as high as people would like.

What each person owns is defined by the private keys which allow them to spend bitcoin balances (i.e. sign new transactions).  Private keys have corresponding public keys, which are converted by a defined method into an account address (adding some error checking and some other steps).  The balance for any address is the sum of all past transactions which use that address.  
Past transactions are recorded in the block chain, which is why full bitcoin clients maintain a copy of the it.  It allows them to independently determine the balance on any account number.  When a new transaction arrives over the network, one of the things done is to check if the sending account had enough balance to make the transaction.  If it does not, the transaction is rejected and not passed to other nodes.

The mechanism isn't convoluted, it's payment for the service of writing a permanent history of transactions, in effect the kind of record-keeping work that accountants do.  But instead of on a paper ledger, or spreadsheet, it's a distributed effort to write a set of files called the "Block Chain".
The core of bitcoin is a history of transactions between accounts.  You want an agreed and unalterable history, otherwise it is fairly useless as a payment system.  The question is how to do this without a trusted central authority, like a bank or accounting firm?  Any central authority could be hacked or become evil, and change the transaction history for their own purposes.
In general, a hash is a checksum calculated from the contents of some data.  In bitcoin, the data is a set of transactions called a "block". You can verify the data has not been altered by calculating the hash again and seeing it matches the previously published value.  But how do you know the hash value itself was not tampered with?  Bitcoin solves this by including the hash value for a block as data in the next block.  Thus each block supplies the hash to verify the previous block, all the way back to the start, forming a chain of blocks.  Thus we call it the "Block chain".
Now how do you reach agreement on the next block, and the transactions that it includes?  In bitcoin this is done by requiring the hash to have a low value (lots of leading zeroes).  The hash is adjusted by an extra number, called a "nonce", which is included along with the transactions and the previous hash.  The only known way to find a sufficiently low hash value is to try lots of nonces until it generates a hash that meets the test.  Then you can publish your block to the network, and everyone will accept it because it is easy to prove the result meets the requirements.
The incentive for finding low hash values (i.e "mining"), and thus creating a new block, is that the finder gets to include a transaction that assigns newly created bitcoins to their own account number.  The difficulty of finding the hash value forces the whole network to compete for the prize of new bitcoins.  Whoever finds a block first gets the prize.  The agreement within bitcoin is that blocks and their transactions formed this way is the official history.  To write a different history would require the whole network's worth of computing power to find different hashes based on different transactions.  
Changing an old transaction invalidates the hash value for that block published in the next block.  For the changed transaction to be accepted, you would need to publish an updated next block with the new hash, and then for every block after it.  In order to catch up with the accepted history of transactions, you need more computing power than the rest of the network combined.  Otherwise the rest of the network keeps publishing new blocks faster than you can publish your revised blocks. The rule for the network is the longest chain of blocks is accepted as the "right" chain, since it represents the majority of the processing power, and therefore is the consensus history of transactions.

Right now China seems to be supplying the demand.  Since their demand is higher than the daily supply of bitcoins, the price is going up as they bid more for the coins.  Eventually the demand from new users in China will saturate (I have no idea when).  At that point the demand will slack off, and the price will start falling.
As the price rises, more and more people will be tempted to sell, in order to lock in their gains, or just go buy something nice.  Thus supply will increase, and eventually overtake demand, or reach an equilibrium.

Not the same fraction of a given coin relative to the total number of that coin.  What I meant was the value of a given coin in relation to the total value of all cryptocoins.  For example on this table:
Sum up the "Market Cap" column, which happens to be in BTC, but any consistent currency unit works.  Then buy each coin in proportion to the percentage that coin makes of the total for the column.  In this example, the total is 12,272,640 BTC, so take your funds and buy:
* 97.8% bitcoins
* 1.69% litecoins
* 0.49% everything else
That table may miss some altcoins, like ripple.  And unless you have lots to invest, the ones near the bottom are too small to bother with.  You can also evaluate each coin on it's merits rather than just blindly spreading your funds across all of them.  But by buying some of all of them, you win regardless of which ends up dominating the market.

A worker is one PC node running the mining software and communicating with deepbit.  Serious miners might have multiple machines running at once, all feeding into a single account at deepbit.
As long as you are showing an increasing number of shares for the worker, you are getting counted.  Depending on the payout method you picked, you will either get paid per share you contribute to the pool, or when a block is found you get a proportional payout from that block based on number of total shares to solve that block.  These days, deepbit as a whole may find a block every hour or two, and the payouts are delayed an hour, so you have to let it run for a while to see the results.

What good is a block chain that is &gt;10 Terabytes, which nobody can store or verify except big centralized operations?  The ordinary user would then have to trust those centralized operations.
A "distributed block chain", where you don't hold a full copy yourself, but the network uses a P2P system to maintain multiple copies might relax that limit somewhat, but then you run up on bandwidth limits.  To verify an incoming transaction as valid, you would have to query the network to determine the past history of that account number.
Even the sheer volume of incoming transactions can exceed what an ordinary internet account can handle.

No. Transactions propagate across the bitcoin network in a few seconds.  The network nodes each check the transaction history to verify the new transaction had enough inputs (funds) to complete.  In low risk transactions, like buying coffee, this should be sufficient. In theory, you can attempt to spend the same funds two or more times (double spending) at different merchants.  This only works if you do it before the first transaction propagates to both merchants.  After that, the second one will be rejected. 
New transactions reside in a transaction pool temporarily. Miners attempt to form "blocks" of transactions out of the pool, adding to the permanent history of transactions (the block chain).  This is intentionally difficult to do, so that it is hard to forge a block.  On average the whole network of miners adds blocks about once per 10 minutes.  When a transaction is included in a block, it is called a "confirmation", and adds another level of security that the particular transaction is valid.
Later blocks include the hash of the previous block in their formation, forming a chain.  Changing any transaction in a previous block forces a change to the block hash, and that of every later block.  That requires re-doing the large amount of computing to form all those later blocks. Thus each additional block makes it unlikely by a large factor that the given transaction will ever be invalidated.
The more important a transaction is to you, the longer you can wait for confirmations to be sure it is rock solid.  Six confirmations/1 hour is considered sufficient for most any reason.  But for small items, zero or one confirmation is enough.

Well, if you didn't understand it, I did a poor job explaining, so I will try again:
Scarcity creates value.  The total number of bitcoins (21 million) is not the only scarce item in the system.  Block size, and therefore number of transactions per hour, is also limited.  Miners can collect transaction fees for putting your transaction into this limited space.  Those fees will pay for running the network after all the coins are mined.  People will pool smaller transactions that can't get into a block by themselves into one big transaction with a bigger fee.  New networks will pop up to do the pooling.

Sure it can.  For example a new company that wants to raise capital starts up a block chain with a balance of one million shares for itself and a document signed with a private key for the issuance of the shares.  The same document is filed with the appropriate agencies to satisfy securities laws.  Instead of using Goldman-Sachs for the public offering, who take a healthy cut for themselves, they cut out the middle-men and sell the shares directly.  The block chain records who bought the shares, after which they can trade freely.  
The incentive for doing this is lower overhead for raising capital.  Since setting up a block chain is geeky, a service company can set up and operate it for multiple companies.  I think the place to look is wherever a middleman currently takes a cut.  There is the opportunity to replace them with a more efficient system.

If you are running a bitcoin client program at home, you will see the transaction arrive for incoming ones, and then the confirmations.  If you are sending funds to someone else, you can check a public version of the block chain for the destination address:
(that address was pulled from the latest block of transactions, substitute the address of whoever you send funds to for the last part of the URL).
The block chain is the public transaction history for bitcoin.  It is designed so that later blocks incorporate a mathematical check (hash) from the previous block.  So attempting to change an earlier transaction invalidates everything that comes after it.  Therefore once about 6 blocks have been added after the one for a given transaction, it is a near impossibility to rewrite the history.  So a transaction at that point is verified, and everyone on the network agrees that it is.


The bitcoin network is a core transaction protocol and database, like whatever the innards of ATM networks, and the network that connects POS swipe terminals with the banks does.  End users will mostly not care about those innards.  People are busy creating "front ends" like web sites, bitcoin ATMs, and other devices that are convenient.
If you know the history of credit cards, the first one, Diner's Club, required the restaurants to phone the amount to the diner's club office, where a human looked up the customer account on a physical paper record, decided if the charge was approved, and made an entry.  The customer only had to pay one bill a month, and the restaurant got more customers because they didn't have to have cash in pocket to eat out.
All our modern electronic networks to handle credit cards have grown over time, they were not there at first.  The same is happening with bitcoin.  The programs and apps are being worked on, and will only get better with time.  Obviously it has reached some level of usability, because individuals and merchants are in fact using it, for 50K transactions a day.
Whether bitcoin can climb the ubiquity/convenience curve, only time will tell, but the internet and smartphones are well on their way to that status, and bitcoin runs as programs/apps on top of that base.  You don't have to set up a plant to manufacture plastic cards, or a whole network to support their use.  So I think it will meet your merchant's tests fairly soon.

There is no need for a database.  Customer who wants a table made runs software local on their PC that collects advertised data from production nodes on what they can do, selects a series of producers to complete the task, funds an escrow account to pay for it, and ships off design files to the producers.  A given production node knows where to send their parts or materials to, because that is part of the order (make these parts, when done, ship to X, when they arrive at X, you will be paid Y bitcoins).
The capabilities data is part of their website, or otherwise accessible from the internet.  You just want a standard format so the software can understand it.  It could be an XML schema, for example.


Sure it can.  Let's assume you want an Oak dining table.  The software can pull up suppliers who carry Oak of sufficient size and quality to meet what is in the design files and display their capability data (price, location, order backlog, etc).  That can include their full website.  Then they can select who they want to do the work by clicking the appropriate box.  Or if they are lazy, they can just choose "find the cheapest production path", or "find the highest reputation production path with &lt; 4 weeks delivery date" and let the software figure it out, present the results for approval, then one click to authorize and fund it.


Price is one of the criteria, but capability is a filter.  If you want black walnut for the table, and the lumber supplier doesn't carry black walnut, it won't be included in the list of suppliers.


No more than a yellow pages directory does.  Each vendor chooses what capabilities to advertise to the network, the same Internet we already use.  Each customer independently creates a production order set based on the advertised information, and whatever else they decide to do.  For example, if I was picky about the wood grain for the table, I could call up a supplier, have them carry a webcam over to the stack of lumber, select some boards, and include that as part of my order.  If it's a couch, and the wood frame isn't visible, the design file may only need to specify the species and lumber grade, and the dimensions of the boards from which the frame will be cut.  On the other hand, for a couch, you might want to physically see and handle a coverings sample book.  In that case, their capabilities data might tell you where the nearest copy is, or how to borrow a copy to examine.

Each node in the Bitcoin network checks that an incoming transaction is valid before relaying it.  That means checking the digital signature, and if the sender had enough funds to make the transaction.  Relaying across the whole network takes seconds.
A "double spend" is attempting to spend the same funds twice, by sending two transactions for the same balance off in different directions.  This is hard to do while at the register of a store, because your internet connection is tied to the same link, so both transactions will go through the same nodes.  Whatever transaction arrives first at a node reduces your available balance, so the second one gets rejected if you don't have enough.
Note: it's perfectly possible to do two different purchases in rapid succession if you have enough balance, that's not a double spend, it's just shopping a lot.
Bitcoin "miners" collect transactions coming from the network, and attempt to create "blocks" with a hash value (checksum) to verify the contents of the transactions.  Just like everyone else, they only accept the first transaction to spend a given balance.  Each block references the previous block, forming a chained history of all bitcoin transactions (i.e. the block chain).  That is what people accept as the permanent record of transactions.  New blocks are generated on average once per ten minutes.
The number of double-spends is under 1 in 10,000 (including accidental and malicious attempts):   So for small purchases the risk is very small to accept a transaction immediately.  For large purchases (like a car or house) the merchant will probably want to wait until enough blocks have been created *after* the one including the transaction to consider it final.  Six blocks, or about an hour, is considered enough finality for any reasonable transaction.
The reason more blocks make it more certain, is the blocks are linked, and changing an entry in a past block means changing all the blocks after it.  The entire bitcoin mining power is devoted to finding hashes for blocks, at a current rate of 54 million trillion calculations per second.  There isn't any feasible way for anyone else to rewrite the blocks, because that much computing power doesn't exist outside the specialized hardware miners use.
@_date: 2013-03-31 17:47:27
See: 
From what I can read there, there are different ways to double spend, and the brute force method depends on number of confirmations.
The probability of an evil mining pool hijacking the block chain with their own version depends on the fraction of the network they control.  If it is more than 50%, they control the block chain and can do anything they want.  If they control a large fraction but under 50%, they have a probability of secretly mining a block chain with an alternate transaction history than what the merchant sees.  Once the merchant delivers your goods, they can release the secret block chain, spending the same coins on something else.
The probability of the evil miner chain being accepted by the rest of the network goes down with time, because everyone else is  building the public block history faster through more hash power.  The evil miners have to be lucky to generate more blocks faster.  I have not seen a formula, but the article implies the probability goes down by a factor of sqrt(fraction of hashing power they control) per block.  So you can take the largest mining pool's fraction of the network, and determine how many blocks you want to wait for the risk of:
(probability mining pool is evil) x (probability brute force attack succeeds with N blocks) is low enough for your purposes.
Whether it makes sense for a mining pool to attempt this attack depends on how much they expect to earn by double spending vs how much they would earn by normal mining.  For a pool that is a small fraction of the network, the earnings from double spending would need to be a multiple of the normal reward for a block, because their odds of double spending are low.  If they are a public mining pool, they also have to consider the loss of trust if it becomes known they are evil.

The "World Wide Factory" concept is a distributed network of individually owned production nodes.  When you want something made, orders and payment go across the network to the various nodes.  Bitcoin is the obvious choice for the payment system.
For remote locations like in space, you can't afford to bring whole factories and infrastructure, they weigh too much.  Instead, you bring a starter kit, which starts to make parts from local materials and energy.  The parts are used to expand production until you have the level needed.

This is the logical fallacy in the deflation argument.  People still need food, shelter, and utilities to live.  Therefore they will spend what they need to get these things.  That forms the base of the economy.
Merchants would have an incentive to accept bitcoins, both for the lower fees and their rising value.  They would offer a discount relative to other payment methods, just like some merchants today offer a cash discount.  Buyers then have the choice of paying less today if they use bitcoins, and some of them will choose to do so.
For people who save for the future, they would have a choice of stocks, bonds, real estate, and bitcoins.  If bitcoin rises in value relative to fiat currency, it is effectively an interest-bearing bond, and can be compared to other investments based on risks and return.  Some people will choose it, others will not.  Some people will be accumulating, others selling for various reasons (buying a house, retirement, inheritance, or just a shift in the economy).

Call 0.0001 bitcoins a "Nakamoto".  Thus 10,000 Satoshi = 1 Nakamoto, and 10,000 Nakamoto = 1 bitcoin.  (And 10,000 bitcoin = 1 fucking lot of money :-). )

It means 3 blocks (of transactions) have been created, one including your transaction, and two after that. Each block has an extremely hard to find hash value that verifies the contents of the block. The block contents include the hash value of the *previous* block. This verifies the contents of the older block are unchanged. Since each block validates the one before it, you can prove the entire history of bitcoin transactions is correct. Since blocks are linked in this way, it is called the "Block Chain".
Each new block is more confirmation that your transaction is valid. Since the hashes are so hard to find, the entire network collaborates on finding them. This ensures no alternate history of events (transactions) can be written, and everyone can trust the Block Chain.  It is also distributed peer-to-peer, so everyone with a full bitcoin client has a copy, making it much harder to tamper with.

Normal business law still works.  You can request some identification from the seller (phone, address, email), have them send a contract (in return for X bitcoins, I will print Y object and ship to your address), which both parties sign, and only then send your bitcoins.  If they fail to perform, you can follow normal business dispute resolution.
A new business just starting up might want to register on a site like Amazon, set up an online store, print to order for some popular items, and build up a seller rating.  Then they can point to that when starting to do business directly.

Coinbase (  ) and BitPay (  ) have 22,000 merchants signed up between them.  They process bitcoin payments back to local currency for the merchants, for a small fee.
Why should merchants use bitcoin?  Between fraud, charge-backs, and normal bank fees, it costs an average of 6% of the sale for a card transaction.  Bitcoin reduces that to 1% or less.  If a merchant's normal profit margin is 5% (not unusual), using bitcoin would double it for the items paid that way.

Court probate offices (where deed records are typically kept now) have slowly migrated to microfilm and electronic storage to save money.  I could see them migrating to block chain technology if it saves them money and adds security.  Right now, any property records still in older formats are subject to fire loss.  Distributed storage would be more secure.
Even if they don't get on board, it should be possible to record a sales contract with them specifying the block chain system as where to find current ownership details.

That's hard to measure.  For example, some of the exchange demand from China may be to get around currency controls and buy stuff outside the country.  For obvious reasons people will not report their purchases.
The most reliable data I know of is the volume going through the merchant processors, like Coinbase and Bitpay, since merchants by definition are accepting funds from other people.  To that we need to add some factor for sellers who take bitcoin directly and handle conversion themselves or keep the coins.  I don't know a good way to estimate that.  For now I use (Coinbase + BitPay volume)+50% as an estimate, but the 50% is a guess.

Thank you, I will study this paper.  From a quick scan, they link a particular 1.00 Bitcoin to ownership, which becomes problematic if the price of the coin becomes larger than the asset.
I was proposing using a block chain as validating documents showing ownership, because you can't easily alter blocks once created.  One could link such a "documentation chain" to the main bitcoin block chain by inserting message on the bitcoin transaction history which contains the hash from an alt-chain block.  Then all past blocks on the alt-chain are as valid as the bitcoin chain.  This avoids the problem of using a variable value bitcoin as the marker.

I can build a backyard solar concentrator and collect kilowatts of solar energy for process heating (in fact I intend to in the near future).  Show me a zero point energy device that does the same and we can talk.
While the Casimir effect is well observed and has a grounding in quantum mechanics, extracting useful amounts of energy from it is an entirely different matter.  The acid test for such a device is placing it in a magnetically shielded thermal-vacuum chamber owned by someone other than the inventor and seeing if it will output net energy.  The point of the chamber is to isolate it from any outside forces that might influence the results.
Show me such a test, and I will move Casimir energy from the "not demonstrated" category to "demonstrated".  Note that moving two plates together and extracting a minor amount of energy that way is a one time thing, similar to charging up a capacitor.  It is not a continuing energy source.
Theoretically the Sun is also a one time energy source.  Eventually it will use up the Hydrogen it has and fusion will cease, but on human timescales that is effectively never.

Offshore means assets in another country than the one you live in, for both legal and illegal reasons.  Large banks facilitate moving funds from one place to another.  Along with lawyers and accountants they help create complicated transactions to befuddle regulators and tax men.
Needless to say, the size of offshoring is immense (~$20 trillion), because the cost of *not* moving your assets is also immense, in the form of taxes, inflation, confiscation, etc.  Most people with enough funds to matter will use the banks and other specialists to protect their assets.

I've been paying taxes on income from virtual currency since 2006 (Second Life Linden Dollars), and so far the US IRS has not questioned my methods, so here is how I would address it:
You are selling a product you helped make (assuming you mined in a pool).  That counts as ordinary business income.  Against that you can subtract legitimate business expenses.  I write off my PC hardware, software, internet connection, and part of my electric bill attributable to running the PC.
If you bought BTC at one price, and later sold them at a different price, that would be a capital gain or loss if you passively held them for appreciation.  
If you were an active buyer and seller on localbitcoins, generating income from the price difference you would then be in business as a dealer.  Then you could also deduct your other costs of making a deal, such as mileage to meet with customers, or hardware (cell or tablet) necessary to make the transaction.
The difference here is between passive investor, where you do nothing to create value, versus mining or creating a local market to buy and sell coins, where you are doing something active to create value.

That's simple, just have the mining algorithm continue at some low level after the initial distribution.  Right now the bitcoin block reward halves every 210,000 blocks.  It was 50 new coins per block originally, is now 25 coins/block, and will drop again around 2016.
Instead of cutting in half repeatedly until the new coins effectively reach zero, just keep it at, for example, 1.5625 coins/block forever after block 1,050,000.  That would provide approximately a 0.4% inflation rate.  It would be fairly trivial to program that into the software.

The extra conversion means you have efficiency losses.  You are better off using bio-engineered bacteria who use sunlight and emit liquid fuels directly.  They have a theoretical solar to fuel efficiency of about 6%, several times higher than crop plants, because they don't expend energy building cellulose and lignin (the main ingredients in plant stalks and wood).
The bacteria emit fuel molecules in a similar way that yeast emit alcohol molecules.  By constantly drawing off the fuel, the concentration doesn't kill the bacteria, like yeast kills itself during fermentation, so it can be a continuous process.  Joule Unlimited seems to be the leader in commercializing this (  ), but lots of other people are doing biotech research in this direction.

Because they are unable to think on the right time scales.  If you have short-term needs, you buy the bitcoins as you need them, and convert them to gift cards or otherwise spend them immediately, and the merchant uses a processor to take out their volatility at the other end.
On the other hand, if you are saving for the long term, as this Mt.Gox 52 week moving average shows, you buy a little every week or month, and over a year or more you come out at least even, and usually way ahead:
The problem right now is people with intermediate holding times, between a few days and a year.  Until we have common shorting tools, or the adoption grows enough to smooth out the drops, people who are that range are exposed to risk.
So the advice for people right now is "spend it right away, or hold it for the long term, but not in-between".

In the US at least, a bank both takes deposits and makes loans.  Exchanges and commodities markets, and the broker/dealers who participate in them, enable buying and selling fiat currencies for other stuff.  The nearest example to bitcoin exchanges would be the foreign exchange market that deals in different fiat currencies.

The answer is to earn transaction fees.  A recent block (269137) earned the miner 25 newly generated coins + 0.2465 BTC in fees.  Over time, transactions are expected to increase, and replace new coins as the dominant income for miners.
The current rush for mining hardware will likely drop off as new coin creation decreases, but there will always be some income from fees, and the miners will live off that instead.

The bitcoin block chain isn't set up to store data types besides monetary transactions.  Some people are working on "colored coins", which my understanding are tokens in bitcoin form, whose ownership represents ownership of some other asset, but that information is external to the block chain itself.
The current bitcoin mining fees come mostly from new coin creation in each block, but that is only a temporary situation until most of the 21 million coins are distributed.  Eventually transaction fees will be the primary reward for mining bitcoins.
An alternate record-keeping system can start up as a purely fee-based system.  For example, inventors might want to record hashes of their invention data to prove priority.  They would use a hash to prevent disclosure of the invention itself, but the hash can prove the invention data existed at a certain time.
Notaries, courthouse probate offices, and anyone else wanting to prove the existence of a document or legal transaction could use such a system, and operate the "mining" hardware.  It might become a use for leftover bitcoin ASICs when the reward is too small to sustain the current crop.  Mining would not be a good name in such a circumstance, they are not creating new coins, merely record-keeping.

I've helped organize conventions in the past, and if you have a significant number of people staying in the hotel you can negotiate a discount for the meeting rooms.  A typical number is 2% of the room occupancy against the function space, but it can vary a lot according to time of year and the local market.  If you fill up the hotel, you can often get the meeting space comped for free, since they make lots of money off the rooms in that case.
Now, services above just the room are often wildly overcharged for.  For example, a few years ago (the last time I was involved), the downtown Atlanta Marriott charged $130 to turn on an outlet box (4 plugs) for the weekend, a job that's not much more than flipping a breaker switch, and whatever power you consume for the duration.  Those extra services can drive up the cost dramatically.  Also if you use a convention organizer service, that tacks another multiplier onto the costs.
I don't have this convention's budget to review, but based on past experience the rate seems high.  If they are paying to fly in guest speakers, or even paying them to speak, $180 might be reasonable, because then a chunk of the cost is above just the hotel expense.

I was there, working on space-based laser and kinetic kill vehicles at Boeing during the Strategic Defense Initiative (Star Wars) program.  I don't know how you think the Cold War ended, but I will give you my perspective:
I find it amusing that people elsewhere in the bitcoin forum tell me to read up on exponential growth, because that is how we won.  SDI was based on a "layered defense" with 7 layers.  These are not the exact numbers, but assume that each layer can destroy 60% of it's targets, leaving 40% to go on to the next layer.  Thus we did not have to design perfect shields, merely reasonably good but porous ones.
40% remaining at each layer means (40%)^7 =0.0016 remains at the end, 1.6 per thousand missiles launched.  (that's where the exponential comes in). That means some will still get through, because the Soviet Union had some tens of thousands of warheads, but 10-20 bombs on US soil was a survivable outcome.  There was no way they could build enough missiles to overcome the attrition.  The combined economies of the West were much larger then the East.
We never actually built the Star Wars system in full.  But the Soviet Union had lots of good mathematicians, and they knew they could not win that technical race.  They were behind in technology, and they could not outbuild the West's proposed defense.  So the mere threat of building that system caused them to rethink, and negotiate arms reduction instead.  We didn't want to back them to an economic wall either, you run the risk of out of control people doing stupid things in desperation.  So both sides wanted to negotiate, and we got the START treaty as a result.

Well, no business or nation could handle blowing up overnight.  But as long as merchants can save 5% on sales using bitcoin vs plastic cards, they will continue to adopt it.
The 5% comes from avoiding credit card fraud, chargebacks, and bank fees from using cards.  If your profit margin is normally 5%, saving 5% on costs would double your profits, which is a heck of an incentive.  Using bitcoin has it's own overhead costs, of course, but they have the potential to be a lot lower.

You are correct that Google Wallet allows chargebacks:
However, Gmail + the Block Chain makes it pretty easy to document you delivered the product as requested by the customer.

The main point is Google Wallet makes it easy to trade online between random people, no complex exchange software is needed (though you can set one up if you want to make it all automated).

The 16th amendment to the US Constitution says:


On that basis, the IRS doesn't care if your income comes from selling chickens, bitcoins, or space aliens.  If it is income, they want to tax it.  In their mind, the only questions are technical ones about how you calculate the income.  That's things like long vs short term capital gain, or what expenses are deductible.
On that basis, if you mine bitcoins and never sell them, it is not income, any more than if you build furniture for your own use.  If you trade or sell the coins, then there are expenses and value of the sale, and you may or may not have net income.
Now, what the IRS thinks is taxable, and their ability to discover a taxable event happened are entirely different issues.  Bitcoin definitely makes it harder for them to "follow the money".  I fully expect people to use bitcoin to avoid paying taxes of all kinds, and this will cause great gnashing of teeth of tax collectors in the future.

I seem to remember Boeing having a fax room in the 1980's in the building I worked in, and facsimile was used by newspapers to send photos 90 years ago.  In fact, AT&amp;T developed the machine to do that over telephone lines.
Thus I don't think it was "illegal" per se, just that AT&amp;T didn't permit ordinary residential lines to use fax machines (or modems in the early days).  They wanted you to pay for more expensive business lines.  Since at that time AT&amp;T was 90% of telephone lines, if they didn't allow it, it pretty much didn't happen.

The way I would describe bitcoin is it's a very secure accounts database.  The security features are so good, that people are comfortable trading real goods and services now for an account balance, in the expectation that they can spend that balance later for something else they want.
Since the total number of units in everyone's accounts increases at a slow and pre-determined rate, the more people that want to use this network for trading, the higher the value of each unit.
(I really think the security of the block chain is the root of bitcoin's value.  If we could not be sure our balances would stay put on it, would we be willing to hold balances?)

When you adjust for inflation, real estate has been more stable than the dollar:
Over very long periods precious metals have stayed within a narrow range:
The dollar was linked to gold until 1933, and therefore the CPI represented the price of gold in terms of other goods.  Between 1933 and 1971 the US progressively removed ties to precious metals, and you can see what has happened.
Gold and real estate are examples.  An economist can probably come up with an optimally stable asset mix to represent a long term store of value, but it should be obvious that physical assets are more stable than fiat currencies on the whole.
People are used to thinking of their local fiat currency as "stable" because it's the unit everyone uses to price things.  But in reality, when you look at them in terms of other currencies, or physical assets, they aren't:

The current block chain growth is ~1 GB/month, and my last hard drive purchase cost me 3.5 cents/GB, so storage cost is not an issue *yet*.  If it grows by 1000x, though, it would be a serious problem for many people.
Anything to postpone that point is good, in my opinion.  Discouraging micro-transactions, pruning the chain, and distributed storage via a torrent-like system are all ways to do it.

Ah, it's back, thanks though.

I congratulate the story author on getting how bitcoins are generated correct.  Most media stories explain it wrong.  I would have congratulated Ms Bjorhus on the Star-Tribune's site directly, but you have to fill out a *screen sized form* in order to comment, so fuck that.  I will comment here instead.
She did make a mistake in listing the Linden Dollar from Second Life as a one of the virtual currencies that has "come and gone".  As you can see from this site, the in-house Linden Dollar exchange (Lindex) is still very active:

They have mail delivery only there.  My title means "there is no CampBX office at that address", not that there are no offices in an office building, or that CampBX doesn't have an office elsewhere, like their apartment.
Their website has a photo of the building and the address under the title "Our Office", and that simply isn't true.  They have mail delivery there, and their office is elsewhere.  The normal meaning of "Our Office" is the regular location where the company staff work, and this isn't it.

I like millicoin, microcoin, and Satoshi (10 nanocoin) as units.  US dimes and cents literally mean tenths and hundreths, so if use becomes common enough, you might just drop the units part and talk about "mills" and "micros" in conversation, and have it understood from context it refers to a fraction of a bitcoin.
For formal use, like price on a shopping website, "15 mBTC" or "0.015 BTC" is more appropriate.

The New York Times has the reputation in the US as our "Newspaper of Record"  (  ).  Obviously under the 1st Amendment they can print whatever they want, right, wrong, or sloppy.  But if they want to maintain their reputation as an authoritative source, they should be careful to print the facts as they know them, and not rumors or what is salacious.  Editorials are an exception, but this appeared under their business section.
What we can do is contact the author, or the author's editor, and let them know about:
* Actual volume of total transactions relative to Silk Road.  Daily volume is here: 
* Non-drug use examples, like the property manager that is taking bitcoin for rent
* The larger shops and payment processors

That was your statement.  I take umbrage when people tell me what I "need" to do.  I was polite in my previous reply, but this time I will be more direct:
Don't fucking tell me what to do.
You really know nothing about me.  Maybe you should take a look at the free an open source book I have been writing about space technology and rethink my sense of privilege and snootiness:
I'm spending my time giving away my knowledge to the next generation.  You are a couch potato.
