I have some experience with cloud mining. Assuming it's a reputable company and doesn't exit scam, you'll probably get your USD investment back, but if BTC keeps going up, you would have been better off to buy Bitcoin  ie..You will never get the amount of Bitcoin you invested back.
Having said that,all cloud mining is not a scam as some people here say, who undoubtedly have never had first hand experience. But it certainly isn't as profitable as you might hope.
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:21:48
I actually feel like I've failed my friends and family, and that they are truly missing the opportunity of our generation. My daughters and my mum are the only ones who decided to chance it but they're up +300% in the few weeks since they got involved, which is just great. Oh, and my assistant at work got in last July so I think she's doing ok too. Not sure how much but she sure seems happy these days lol
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:30:26
Just one other thing, while I think of it. Depending on your mining company, you will get payments either automatically as you earn a certain threshold, or you have do a withdrawal process. If you have a choice, withdraw as rarely as possible. This is because lots of little transactions into your wallet will be very expensive for you to move later. Bitcoin transactions cost by weight, not amount, and lots of small mining tx's are very, very heavy. I have contracts for 10's of Terrahash and I rarely withdraw less than monthly.
I think your earnings are safe enough on Hashing24 or Hashflare. Genesis pays you automatically.
For future reference, assuming a good mining company, you can still be profitable so long as you pay less than $120/THs for at least a 2 year plus contract. Lifetime is better. Good luck finding that these days.

Your "coins" are an electronic digital record on the  blockchain. Any wallet you use is just an app to interact and transact the "coins" associated with your wallet. As such, so long as you sent them to an address associated with your wallet, then they aren't lost. You just lost the app that gives you access to them.  Rather than wait days/weeks to download the blockchain, I would down load a wallet like Exodus, but when you install it use the "restore wallet" option rather than new wallet, and type in your keywords. Once installed, open the wallet and your Bitcoin should be there., although make sure the wallet is synchronized (only takes a minute or so).  Assuming all is good, look for a more secure option like a hardware wallet (a Ledger Nano S or Trezor etc..) later, and without panic. If your "coins" aren't there, then you can simply delete the wallet and you're back to square one, and you only lost 10 minutes of time.

Sorry about the delay replying, I had to sleep.
So, a quick google search shows that Coinomi wallet uses 18 seed words and you can download that for PC or phone. I just installed it myself and it seemed intuitive enough.  Assuming you can retrieve your coins, be aware a lot of people don't consider open source wallets like Coinomi or Exodus very secure, but for retrieval purposes it should be fine. I personally use Exodus for easy access to some alts I hold and love the wallet, but I wouldn't trust it with huge amounts.
 Good luck and please let me know how it goes!

You never actually have your coins on your Ledger, or any other wallet, for that matter. Your wallet merely holds the private keys which enables you to access the coins for transaction purposes. The "coins" never leave the blockchain.
@_date: 2019-07-21 22:28:53

@_date: 2017-12-29 00:15:50
There just seem to be 3 types of people when it comes to any new phenomenom. There's the fud'ers (Fear Uncertainty Doubt) and the fomo'ers (Fear Of Missing Out), neither of whom seem to do much research and are prone to repeating ad hominems like "it"s a ponzi" or "think of the children" blah blah blah. Then there's the group who actually investigate and research what's going on and make educated decisions upon whether to invest or not. This third group then has to suffer all the criticisms from the first group of fud'ers who in fact know nothing at all, and the never ending repetitive questions from the fomo'ers who need validation for their investment choices. It get's tiresome. If you haven't read the Bitcoin whitepaper, at the very least, then you have no right to comment. This applies to any topic.
@_date: 2019-07-30 00:10:01
Have a look at the back of your ledger. That phrase is engraved in the back. It displays that phrase when the wallet times out, and indicates that you need to enter your password again.
@_date: 2019-07-30 22:23:50
Not the same wallet, but I lost my password once. I was able to reinstall the wallet using my seed words, during which I was prompted to create a new password.
Edit: You could always try to install another wallet using your seed, like Exodus or Atomic, just to gain access to your coins, then transfer to a more secure wallet? It only takes a few minutes and you have nothing to lose and I'm pretty sure passwords don't carry over to new installs.

Here in Australia, my gold exchange also sells BTC now, which would have been very convenient when I did it. Possibly you have a local exchange that does the same?
As others here have offered, get a hardware wallet. I have a Keepkey and a Ledger Nano S. The Keepkey is really elegant and easy to use and I prefer it, but the Ledger offers more functionality ie. you can keep more different currencies in it.

This is a good example of why people want to get their money out of the hands of banks (and government). No 3rd party should be able to dictate where you send your money or what you do with it. If banks had acted ethically then Bitcoin would probably never have been born. It's ironical that bad behaviour by the banks led to the birth of their own demise. I hope..

@_date: 2017-12-29 00:44:54
This proves nothing. Technology improves regardless, and if it wasn't Bitcoin it'd be some other form of wealth transfer that criminals will utilize. Neither Bitcoin nor Dollars create crime, they are just instruments co-opted by it. Bitcoin is not responsible for paedophilia or any other crime, they are 2 seperate issues you, and others, are trying to conflate together.

Hashflare sucks fat red ones. They unilaterally changed my contracts from lifetime to 1 year only, about 2 months ago. Definitely do not trust them. If you gotta do cloud mining, you need long contracts at the right price ($120-150 per TH/s or less) and a miner that doesn't charge tx fees to move your BTC to your wallet, Genesis mining is the only company I know to offer lifetime contracts any more, and they're sold out of hashrate.
Hashflare payments also take days to complete.

Lol yeah. I literally bought 15TH/s lifetime contact the day before they changed all pre-existing contracts to 1 lousy year ones. Hard to trust or feel positive about a company that does that. Hashing24 changed their contracts to 2 years for new contracts, but left existing ones alone. Fair enough. Genesis Mining comitted to maintaining lifetime contracts. GM pays daily with no fees at all and no input needed (set and forget). H24 and Hashflare require active withdrawal, email confirmation and charge fees for that privelege. In fairness, Hashflare did drop the withdrawal fee as BTC went up in value. H24 are yet to do that. Draw your own conclusions  :)
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:28:33
Not completely sure of these numbers, but I read somewhere that each Bitcoin costs around $1200 in electricity and computing power to mine. That's hardly "nothing".
@_date: 2018-09-30 22:46:37
If you have the seed words (or your private keys) for your old wallet, you can install pretty much any BTC wallet using those seed words, and your Bitcoin will still be there. If you didn't keep the seed words (HINT: ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS WRITE those down when you set up a wallet, and store them somewhere securely. Do not "copy and paste" for security reasons), then possibly the old HDD can be accessed by someone with the tech know-how. It depends whether the amount you have is worth the expense to recover it.
Just so you know, bitcoin (or any other crypto currency) is not actually held in a "wallet". The coins exist always on the blockchain, and your wallet is merely an app that allows you to interact with the blockchain. Recover the app/wallet and your bitcoin will be available to you again.

This is my concern also, speaking as a long term former gold investor. Swapping paper on the share market should have no effect on real physical gold (or maybe Bitcoin) but here we are, and it sure does.

I'm not getting into a fiat vs crypto argument.  I believe the risk/reward is worth it for me to speculate in crypto and I love the idea of never having to deal with a bank again. I hope that happens. You don't have to feel the same, that's fine.
I completely agree with you regarding security at present, but once wallets become foolproof and simple, that may change.
BTW with a hardware wallet, your keys are stored in only one place, maybe two as a back up strategy, wherever you choose to store them. They are never exposed on the internet unless you're foolish. I keep mine on 2 crytosteels which would be very hard to lose/destroy, but I won't tell you where I keep those, for obvious reasons.
@_date: 2018-06-03 06:02:29
I also have both these, and honestly can't recommend the Keepkey until they enable the ability to vary transaction fees. I remember 66k sats/kb last January that I had to eat. It's fine as a cold wallet and an elegant device otherwise. Definitely get a Ledger if you plan to transact often, and it has a greater range of tokens it can protect.

I agree. They need to start jailing some of these crooked fucks, and relieving them of their assets under civil forfeiture laws.
After the GFC, so far as I know, Iceland was the only country in the world that jailed some of it's corrupt bankers.

For real. Long story short, I've traded 3 cars now to the local merc dealers, none having more than 15k on the clock. The last time I kinda got talked into the diesel. I'm not a mechanical person, never had one before but I was assured it'd be great. So, my mistake was in trusting the dealer knew my driving style. Their solution after many occasions suddenly being in Limp Home mode, was to go for a long drive every month. Well, I just don't have time or inclination to do that, so the problem persists.
 Just thought I'd let another diesel driver know what's up, and maybe avoid the problems I've had.
 As for the BMW, I went to look at a M3 few months ago, but they didn't have one in stock and told 
me they'd call me when one arrived. Still waiting for that call....
 I looked at Audi RS models last week, and those dealers have so far been very good in terms of competitive pricing and returning calls etc, so I'll probably go for an Audi in the new financial year.

There are some wallets, which don't allow you to vary the transaction fees. Keepkey hard wallet is like that (which is why my Keepkey is binned). There are others. That may account for some of this.

Crypto is not "put in" to a Trezor. All cryptos are recorded on their respective blockchain/lattice/tangle or w/e and that is where they exist. Your wallet is merely an app that allows you to transact them. A hard wallet has an additional layer of security in that you need the hard wallet physically in your hand along with its password, to allow that access to the app. The tokens are never lost even if you lose your wallet, you can just set up a new one from your seed phrase.

Methinks a lot of younger people in this space, which makes sense since that's the most tech literate group. Patience isn't a stong suit when you're young, that develops with experience. I personally invested in gold for decades before realizing just how manipulated that market is. People who may not have invested before, maybe don't see that exact same manipulation happening to Bitcoin now. Also, too many memes, not enough patience imo.

I just now bought a new Ledger Nano X, and it comes bundled with a "backup" Nano S, all for Australian $254 on the official Ledger site. I think that's about the price of a T? So two devices for the price of one, sounds like a good deal to me :)
Also, the Trezor doesn't allow storage of one of the few alt's I like, but I won't mention the name for fear of shilling. Just double check you can protect the crypto's you invest in.

Why does this same question keep getting recycled? Read back through past reddits and you'll see that buying and holding BTC was and is always the best investment. This becomes even more true as difficulty of mining increases.
Also, if you even need to ask the question, then you don't have the knowledge and shouldn't be mining imo.

It's common with most exchanges, for there to be a delay before they actually send the funds to your wallet. That can range from minutes to days. Once the exchange actually sends it, the transaction should take very few minutes, and the funds should be accessible in your wallet.

Honestly, for one transaction only? The learning curve is too steep to bother imo. You need to learn about, and download a wallet. Then you need to open an account with an exchange. Then agonize over your first ever transaction. It's simply too much trouble for one single transaction. It'd be easier just to get a new dealer.

I'm not technical so I'll give a brief  synopsis of the event. Prior to the Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash hard fork, Bitcoin mining was supposed to be ASIC resistant, or something like that. Bitmain produce ASIC cards which at the time had something called  covert ASIC boost (again, I think) and were very interested in maintaining the mining advantage that conferred to them. Hence, their frenzied and heavy support of the Bitcoin cash fork, since mining that permitted full use of their "hack".
I'm sure someone will correct this version of events, but that's in large part how I remember it. Also, bigger blocks, but that's another story.

This is all great and all, but do you really need to crack the PW if you have the seed words? I'm a bit of a tech illiterate, but having lost a password to a wallet once, not sure if it was Electrum, all I had to do was reinstall the wallet using the seed phrase. During the installation process, it prompted me to create a new password. Wallet was accessible with all contents afterwards.
@_date: 2019-08-14 21:48:43
Not sure if it's still the case, but I had a certain hardware wallet (I won't mention the name, but it starts with a "K" and ends with a "eepkey"...lol) that during the Dec 2017 run, insisted on setting fees at 65.000 sats/kb with no way to vary it. Maybe other wallets have hard set fees also?

Nice write up, I enjoyed reading it. I agree with your sentiments. I tried trading and ended up in front on a USD basis, but behind in terms of how much BTC I still had. Hodling is far less stressful and more profitable unless you're some kind of trading guru. Also, I've been through a few "crashes" now and tbh, this time I didn't even raise a sweat. I'm not even slightly stressed, just bought more in increments as the BTC price dipped. 
Just a heads up, I don't think it's over yet so there may be further buying opportunities ahead.

I bought up some cloud mining a few months ago, and 2/3 contracts are getting close to my initial investments, so it's looking like I might make a dollar profit. However, mining difficulty is getting higher and my payments are getting lower so the lifetime contracts will eventually die.
My conclusions from my experience are as follows:
1) I don't regret buying these contracts because I learned a lot in the process.
2) I would NOT do it again because if I had put those dollars straight into Bitcoin, I would be waaaay better off financially. Anyone buying these cloud contracts now need to realize that the entry price is now higher by around 100% than what I got in for. Also, mining difficulty is much higher than when I got in, so less payouts. Feasibly, if BTC continues to rise in price, then it may become profitable, but in that case I think you'd be better off owning BTC from the beginning. Finally, few cloud miners offer lifetime contracts any more. If I was buying it today, there is no way I would be getting my money back, no way at all.
Cloud mining companies seem beholden to noone...payments missed/late for a variety of reasons, some charge fees to take your BTC off site, Hashflare unilaterally decided last month to change everyon'e contracts to one year ones, making them non profitable. If you insist on buying cloud mining, then the best of the bunch I've found, is Genesis mining (if I'm allowed to say that. No shill, just my experience).
 On people like Crypto Nick. This guy, and others like him, make most of their money from referrals. This is why they promote mining and worse (I'm looking at you, Bitconnect). I don't think highly of these sort of promoters at all. Normal people without hundreds of referrals, do NOT make bank like he does.
Put your money into BTC is my advice.

In 4 months, wouldn't you have mined 1 BTC? It doesn't matter what the price is until you sell. After 4 months, you'd still be making more BTC , all profit.
In reality though, due to difficulty adjustments, you'll be mining less every 2 weeks, so your ROI will probably be 7-8 months, but after that, profit. I think you'll still mine more than 1BTC though, so not the worst decision. Just be patient.

I would actually recommend Exodus as a good starting wallet. Very easy, intuitive interface with a lot of features. It gives you the ability to easily exchange to some decent alts if you later choose to do so. Admittedly, there are fees involved if you use the exchange, since it's Shapeshift, but for starting out until you learn more and become more confident and competent with your crypto activities, it's a very nice thing to use.
Obligatory: DYOR (Do your own research). Good luck and welcome aboard.

To Coinbase, and other companies in this space. I would be entirely forgiving of server crashes and other inconveniences, if only you just bothered to inform us, your customers. It's fucking basic, spend 2 minutes of your valuable company time and send a tweet or make a post, so we know what's going on. Even better, spend some money on customer service. I know it's the wild west in crypto land right now, but if you want to prosper when things get mainstream, customer service is essential. It builds loyalty to your brand.

@_date: 2018-03-10 06:47:37
Incorrect. Fees are set depending upon the weight of the transaction. For example, if you buy 1BTC on an exchange and transfer it, that will amount will be consolidated already and will cost far less than if you send 1BTC composed of many small (mining) inputs. The value of the transaction has nothing to do with it at all.

Can't adjust transaction fees on Keepkey. I love this device but this is a deal breaker for me. During the recent mempool spamming, my KK wanted 66,000sats/kb to transact, and I am not exaggerating.

Made a new account for this, since my old one has disappeared.
My first wallet was a MultibitHD wallet and was responsible for my first btc heart attack. Tried to open it one day, and it didn't recognize my password, no matter what I tried, including reinstalls. So, after much angst, I installed a breadwallet on my ios phone using my seed phrase (created a new password during the installation), and lo &amp; behold, my balance was restored. Yay. This probably works on other wallets.
Basically, if you have the seed words, then the btc is safe.

I just transferred it from Coinmama straight to Bittrex to trade for alts. If you want to purchase and hold, then any wallet you use is fine. I personally use and recommend Ledger Nano S hardware wallet for the bulk of my holdings. For a desktop wallet, I like Exodus..it has a really nice interface, stores many crypto's and has an inbuilt exchange, but it's best not to store large amounts on desktop wallets. I don't use a phone app, so I can't comment on those but I believe Coinomi is good.
@_date: 2017-09-26 09:52:48
All my online btc purchases involved a percentage fee, so small purchases shouldn't disadvantage you when purchasing. Do check individual exchanges you might use though, as some may vary.
The fees that will hurt you will be transaction fees if you move small amounts to your wallet, often. I'd recommend to use a reputable exchange (it's all relative lol) so you can accumulate your btc there and do less frequent withdrawals. Bear in mind, most sensible hodlers will strongly recommend moving crypto off the exchange as quickly as possible, for security reasons. You need to determine your own degree of comfort there, but for smallish amounts you should be safe leaving in the exchange.
 I'm in Aussie. I use Independent Reserve (overnight deposit on weekdays, direct market prices buying and selling, only offer BTC, ETH and BCC) and Coinspot (Instant purchase using Polipay, decent range of other cryptos available, marked up prices but you sell at those prices too) primarily and trust both, in that I have had no problems at all using them. You might be able to access these from NZ, i dunno..
 Hope that helps
Couple of other quick thoughts.
The exchanges I use require verification, so that information mightn't be helpful, sorry.
I have noticed some gold/silver bullion dealers also sell btc/eth here in Oz, so that might be another avenue for you.
I sometimes buy crypto by exchanging bitcoin for whatever crypro on Shapeshift or Changelly. Also, some cryptos are hard to resell as not all exchanges carry all cryptos, so you can reverse trade these back to bitcoin or anything else you want. Both have good assortment of cryptos but you know, fees. Changelly is my fave and is very quick.
Wallets. You'll need a few, possibly one per crypto, and there's lots of resources out there, so get studying lol. Just never lose your seed words when you set up a wallet, or your money is probably lost.. I've had several wallet disasters and every time, I was able to just restore a wallet (or use a totally different one due to no longer supported..) just from having the seed words. When my Iota wallet stopped working last weekend, my heart didn't even skip a beat. Took a day (Google is your friend) and it's restored. A day in the life of a bitcoiner lol. Hopefully, you'll have no problems like these, but a read of the forums will suggest mishaps are common. Just secure those seed words, don't show them to anyone, and you'll be good.

In NiceHash panel, go to the "check my stats online" button. A page will open and there you will find your expected payout and what date that will occur. I'm pretty sure, for an external wallet, you need to generate 0.01btc before you're eligible for payout, probably due to transaction fees eating anything less than that. That takes about 3 weeks with my 1x1070 and 1x1060 cards.

An EFT is basically a paper representation of an asset. I believe these are an instrument for big finance to manipulate a market without actually owning any of that asset. Look at gold market moves the past few years. Every time there is a sell off which suppresses the price, you will see millions of these paper EFT's change hands, but once the dust has settled, you realize no actual physical gold was ever moved. Be wary of these EFT's and I for one do not welcome them into this space.

Just a copy of something I posted...
Bitcoin is entirely digital. It remains on the Blockchain always. Your "wallet" is basically an app that proves your ownership of X bitcoin, and gives you access to do as you will with it. You can have a hardware wallet, like Ledger Nano S or Trezor, to provide an extra layer of security, in that the hw wallet acts like an "air gapped" computer and never connects directly to the internet during a transaction, just allows you (or whoever holds the device) an extra chance to approve or deny a transaction. Without it, someone with access to your computer/phone can potentially hack you. I saw a Youtuber once have his wallet emptied online, while it was open. Apparently, he had remote software, Teamviewer, installed on his PC and someone was just waiting for him to open his wallet. A hardware wallet would have avoided this.
Other than that, all good wallets, hard or soft, have a secret key (or seed phrase) when you install them, usually 12, 16 or 24 words. It is EXTREMELY important that you write these words down accurately and store that phrase safely. Thus, if you ever lose the wallet for any reason, you just need to re-install a new one using the original seed phrase, and your money is safe. Lose the seed words, and you are boned if your wallet crashes. There is no tech help in crypto land. That's why you'll hear on Reddit a lot, that if you don't have the keys (seed phrase/words) then you don't own the Bitcoin. 
Edit: I tried to post this to your next comment, but somehow screwed up my edit and it won't let me now..

Bitcoin is entirely digital. It remains on the Blockchain always. Your "wallet" is basically an app that proves your ownership of X bitcoin, and gives you access to do as you will with it. You can have a hardware wallet, like Ledger Nano S or Trezor, to provide an extra layer of security, in that the hw wallet acts like an "air gapped" computer and never connects directly to the internet during a transaction, just allows you (or whoever holds the device) an extra chance to approve or deny a transaction.

  Final advice, just open an exchange account and buy a small amount of Bitcoin. Only Bitcoin, since you don't seem to have enough knowledge yet, to dabble in alt tokens, most of which are crap. Familiarize yourself with the withdrawal procedure from the exchange sending your BTC to your wallet. Always double or triple check the address you're sending to. If you send to an address meant for another token, you will lose your BTC. Also, sadly, there are malicious codes that can change a "copy and paste" to a scammers address. 
I had my daughters do this with very small amounts, and then delete the wallets entirely. Then they reinstalled the wallets using their seed words, just to check that all was working as it should, and their BTC was still accessible. You never lose bitcoin, but you can lose access to it, as many stories on Reddit will testify. This process saved me a heart attack when my first ever Bitcoin wallet corrupted and became inaccessible. Wallets are much better now btw, but not necessarily bullet proof :)
Add more BTC once you're comfortable with how things work.
You have a lot to learn, but once you own a little Bitcoin, I found it gives great motivation to learn  what you need to.
Be aware of the scams and hacks that thrive in the crypto space. Never click an unexpected link in your email or browser. No-one is sending you free bitcoin, believe me. Never click the top few sites when you do a google search. Often the top ones are phishing sites. Oh, there's so much more, but even a simple read of Reddit every now and then will keep you up to date.
 As someone here already mentioned, check out Andreas Antonopolous on Youtube, particularly some of his earlier stuff to understand the space. The guy's a great educator.
 Above all, welcome to Bitcoin :)

I'm in Australia, but we have a site called Living Room of Satoshi, whereby you can send them crypto up to $1000 per day and they deposit the equivalent amount of fiat into your nominated bank acount, credit card, or pay a bill for you. Perhaps there's an equivalent service in the UK?

I invested in physical gold bullion for decades but have now given up on it. One thing I noticed once gold EFTs were introduced, that whenever gold seemed to want to increase in price, there was often a big selloff to push the price down. Later analysis generally showed that in the selloff, very little actual physical gold was actually sold/traded. It was masses of paper EFTs that were moved. 
I think gold EFTs are a method of controlling value by institutional people who have no actual gold.
I am concerned similar may happen in Bitcoin trading.

The author wasn't really claiming this as a TA., if I read it correctly. He said he was asked to talk to a bunch of intelligent people about something he really didn't know much about, so this was his spiel. Not trying to shill or sell it, just drawing some interesting historical parallels, not analysis.

Former Gold bug here, flipped it all to Bitcoin a couple of years ago. No regrets :)

Interesting. Have you joined the claim on Mt Gox assets? I haven't been following it closely, but I believe they've begun a civil rehabilitation process, following the bankruptcy, to try to get Bitcoin back to original account holders. It may be too late, I dunno, but it could be worth your while to investigate further.

Coinspot also, has Polipay for instant payment. Great service desk also.

Don't need internet, just a working phone. Most of the world has that.

There's probably hundreds of ETF's, albeit smaller than this one, around the world. I know for a fact we have them in Australia.
I'm not convinced ETF's will help BTC price, possibly the opposite. They mean rich people who own no gold, can manipulate the price. I used to follow Gold Council and other report's, and every time Gold went up or down, almost no physical gold changed hands. Hodlers hold, and big speculators manipulate imo
@_date: 2018-04-28 23:19:08
Gold is just too manipulated via ETF's on the stock exchange. Over 35 years that I invested in gold, pretty much every time it looked like it was going to increase in value there'd be a big sell off to suppress the price again. Once the dust settled, I'd find that no-one actually sold physical gold, they just moved wads of paper on the stock market. There is far more money in the "gold market" than there is actual gold. I fear this is happening with Bitcoin but I have no regrets swapping my gold holdings into crypto.

Lol, it's manipulated up on very small volume and when it's high enough Roger will dump some more, probably for BTC. Playing it like a violin.

I've been saying for a while now, that in the lifetime of some Redditors now, they will be asteroid mining for gold and other rare metals. We're only limited by technology, at present.

I've had zero issues with NAB so far, including credit card purchases.

Sorry man, I should have included a  /s

Hey, don't put yourself down. Reddit can do that for you :)
@_date: 2018-04-26 12:17:33
I think within 100 years or sooner, asteroid mining will make gold common, so I think this is reasonable.
Edit/PS: Don't invest in precious metals futures imo

I saw a You tube video where he actually called it "my project". Sorry, I'm at work and can;t search for the link but it was in a recent interview with a Youtuber.

Sweet. Good to know!

Actually, I might have exaggerated. I got about $40 from the free earn which didn't take long, maybe 1 hour total, if that. Some is available as soon as you log in first time, some (XLM) I got from an invite about 2 weeks after I joined. The rest is from some referrals.

Don't lose the seed. This is probably the number one lesson to learn in crypto.
If your wallet is open, then yes, you can send your funds anywhere you want, including a new wallet.
@_date: 2018-12-27 02:58:31
I agree. Poor support, and inability to vary transaction fees were deal breakers for me.
PS. Anyone want to buy a 2nd hand Keepkey? lol
@_date: 2019-05-20 01:36:25
After your first transaction or two, your limit will go  up.
Edit. I only joined 2 weeks ago, initial limit was tiny like yours. One transaction later my limit became $750 pw. I assume it will keep rising if I use it more.
PS: Don't forget to do the free earn stuff on Coinbase, it's not much but $100 or so for little effort.
@_date: 2019-05-10 22:46:22
Yeah, I had to spread my massive holdings out a bit, too much to risk in one, or even a thousand wallets /s
@_date: 2018-12-31 06:07:49
And animals. Don't forget to help all the animals.
My cat nearly died a year ago from a paralysis tick. When I took him to the vet, they were so happy that I demanded they try and save him, no matter the cost. I found out later that most people wouldn't be able to afford that cost and would opt to put the animal down, and that's why they were happy. Not the money, but to be able to do what they trained for.
If I were Bill Gates wealthy, I'd set up a trust where people could apply to have pet bills paid or subsidised.

Your question illustrates a lack of knowledge about Bitcoin, wallets, transaction fees, opening exchange accounts and so much more.
Do some reading, watch some Andreas Antonopolous videos on You Tube and learn about Bitcoin before you spend money on it, please!
@_date: 2019-05-20 21:31:19
Can't you just set up your Ledger using the keys (seed words) from your paper wallet? I've done this with other wallets, just not familiar with paper wallets.
