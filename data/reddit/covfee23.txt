I had a limit sell at 107.... when I realized it it had gone from 80 to 130 overnight. Didn’t think it could go up any more that quickly. Now it’s triple :( But I got in ethereum before it’s rise ;)

So will bitcoin split value with B2X or will Bitcoin retain its value and B2X will have some small value? 
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:50:08
So would you want to sell your B2X right away and buy mor btc?
