Why do you keep saying triggered, because I disagree with how someone values Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:14:16
This is just shows how much of a bubble you live in.
Real progress happens when over 50% of the earth's population has access to clean water, a problem money can fix...
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:37:14


You've yet to present any new information...

Valuing crypto by another independently fluctuating currency is a very bad idea. Because you're ultimately making the payment in bitcoin you should value it in bitcoin, but saying it was worth X amount at this time can be an interesting way of visualising the amount being given.

I give up, please re-read this non existent comment you're referring to.
Edit: /\ look up there numb nuts, it says I give up. (lol -s)

Your ignorance knows no bounds, I'm still a student that pays thousands a year to use a motorbike, thousands more to have education, and thousands more to live, none the less I donate to the EFF at every fucking opportunity I get.
Unapologetically, fuck you and everything you stand for.
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:11:58
Because you're capable of appreciating and respecting their opinions but not ours?
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:21:45
Thanks for the racist remarks.
I don't infact have a religion despite your nonsensical fascism. Being a member of the highest form of enlightenment, I couldn't care less what fucking religion someone is, if they are drinking dirty water they have the right to clean water.
Edit: also I can't see anything you post further
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:15:18
But why would you give me such a currency if you didn't intend for me to use it as such?
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:56:37
Does your exclusionary enlightenment give the world clean water then?
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:47:24
Why are you even on the bitcoin sub if you don't use crypto?
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:43:59
So removing the buzzwords, you want 50% of the world to just die so you can 'fulfill' an illogical goal with no end.
You *genuinely* sicken me
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:28:04
I absolutely have a better solution, STOP TELLING PEOPLE TO NOT HELP THOSE IN NEED.
@_date: 2018-09-12 17:02:47


And we're supposed to be proud of you? HODLing only makes sense if you mined the coins a few years ago.
@_date: 2018-09-12 19:47:12
That's just illogical, although I understand what you mean. If everybody buys BTC out of pity, it will never be seriously adopted.
Trading and using BTC as a currency will help standardize it much more.

I'd like to thank you for your donations to Erowid and the EFF. It's clear that you understand the importance of non-political information sources, good luck in future your endeavours.

Jesus Christ this is childish. Do you people realise they monetarily benefit from this "drama"?

Bro, have you tried Joe Rogan?
@_date: 2019-02-23 13:11:16
Kinda defeats the purpose of using it at all then doesn't it. I'll stick to cold storage and offline transactions through tails.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:55:47
TIL you have to be verysmart to use shred.

You can fathom how people do stuff for money?

This is such a circlejerk, put your money into property. Bitcoin values and devalues so quickly it's not worth touching, not to mention how grossly impractical it is to use. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 15:12:33
What do you mean by a chainalysis database? You can examine the public blockchain _without_ access to keys, exchange through your preferred alt coin if you want to hide transactions.
But yes, we need a P2P alternative to Coinbase (which exist) but there are laws in my country requiring ID for the purchase of crypto. I use XMR for person to person transactions, but I don't trust the value of a private chain coin.

Pick any one of the millions of useless inventions you've never heard of/where dropped immediately.
This post is frankly ridiculous, trying to pass a shitty infographic as evidence for something without considering the opposite view.
A much better example would be small denominations of currency, people don't like to use physical money and bitcoin *is* the solution.
