Oh the fun. Well, it's not a "police" per-se, they are just trying to observe and look at how the govt can benefit from it... As per usual, everyone wants their piece of the pie, and no one wants crypto to be the biggest wealth redistribution system as it is.

Hard to say, but if we want war, we will lose it. If we want gradual change, it's a certain win.

We still need a stable scalable solution, which lightning isnt at the moment. Let's hope it will be safe and completely usable asap, for the sakes of the investors. All I wish is for bitcoin/crypto to be usable on a global scale.
@_date: 2018-03-21 01:24:12
aaaaaaaaand from locking people out of their accounts for dealing with crypto, to this. Fun ride we are on, totally fun.

Nice! Hope it works out and gets widely adopted! I'll save you a spot on the train that goes to the moon!

Everyone is trying to manipulate it. It's the thing of the future, and everyone wants to get in as early as possible. On top of that, average crypto investor is young and uneducated as far as trading/investing goes so they follow the trends (FUD and FOMO). Many people would do the same, if the opportunity to make money through posting a few articles just presented.
@_date: 2018-03-21 22:43:58
Why does everyone want a lambo and a ticket to the moon? - That's the question to ask. Look at maturity of the market and mass psychology

By the end of the year, we will leave the 1000 doggystyle memes in the dust as well hopefully...
@_date: 2018-03-17 23:00:04
Hah, no worries. If it comes to that, we can discuss the eating part and your preferences ;)
@_date: 2018-03-21 22:41:38
That's a bit optimistic. I love Bitcoin, but to expect all of the financial institutions to accept the way of Bitcoin in only 10 years is unlikely, and the option of them disappearing is close to none. Sure Bitcoin will be a big part of our lives then, but.... Not a single currency. That kind of globalization, this socialized crony-capitalism isn't ready for
@_date: 2018-03-23 01:23:35
Conspiracy theorists will drool over this. Keep your holdings tight and trust in the tech, and you will be fine.
@_date: 2018-03-17 22:40:55
If forbes is right i will too. Their advisor is basing the research on the past, which had such different fundamentals. It's a no-go. But will BTC go up if you ask me? YES. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 01:25:45
You got an upvote from me. Thanks for the full-of-content post, with a purpose.
@_date: 2018-03-21 22:45:56
Thanks for the content provided, It delivered substance and with a flare. GJ
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:07:47
As much as i wanted to sell off every bit of my bitcoin, i find holding my bags and shorting it regularly a win win for me, just further increasing my position. GL HOLDERS! 
@_date: 2018-03-20 01:23:47
So It will support cryptos (decentralized blockchain solutions that back themselves) once they get centralized and backed... Facepalm indeed...
@_date: 2018-03-19 01:56:45
Short term sentiment is there for people to capitalize on the smaller moves. Why wouldnt knowledgeable people use/abuse that? But long term fundamentals and use cases always win, no doubt! 
@_date: 2018-03-22 00:47:48
Seems so ;)
@_date: 2018-03-25 00:57:33
Lovely! This way i can lose my bitcoin as well as my fiat by sucking at poker! On a side note, great design, would love for this to go global. GJ
@_date: 2018-03-23 01:27:08
It won't last forever sure. Neither will fiat. But it will last long enough for us to benefit from it, both lifestyle wise and profit wise.

+1 for the Ben 10000, but let's leave them both in the dust price wise!
@_date: 2018-03-17 22:35:16
Truth being told, this was just a FUD fuel that was added to the fire. The true reason BTC has dropped is clear. Parabolic rise resulting in a drop resulting in a lack of demand and people losing interest due to unsolved scaling issues. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 01:53:17
Nice! Thanks for sharing this! Cheers
@_date: 2018-03-22 00:47:34
All i was trying to say is that the crypto average investor is young and doesnt know how to properly invest, which makes the market moves a bit obvious, as well as market a bit more sentiment driven. Everyone wants the lambo, and everyone is panicking, depending on where we are in the market.
@_date: 2018-03-21 01:21:48
it's not sadly. It still has a few flaws and people are hesitant to use lightning. Soon though, very soon.
@_date: 2018-03-24 00:58:30
It's hard looking at the current economy and thinking where it has gone wrong... If true capitalism restores, fully decentralized and without any social aspect, it might be overall perfect for the society. But there will always be pareto distribution in any creative task. No way around it
@_date: 2018-03-21 01:26:34
The slowest transaction you can create is the one so inexpensive that it never goes through. Are we talking LN though or?
@_date: 2018-03-23 01:28:31
Worried? Short term maybe, because the hype is gone and we need a fundamental breakthrough to rise up. But long term no, we shouldn't because the spike during December was a mini bubble spike in usage and that's normal. Things are back to how they are supposed to be now
@_date: 2018-03-21 01:19:38
Exactly. No one should be biased, but rather objective. Still far from the finish line, but slowly pacing ourselves towards it
@_date: 2018-03-25 00:56:32
Nice to see people sharing  knowledge with the community. There are many people who seek for beginner help on the forum. Thank you for posting!

Localbitcoins was always great to use for cash exchanging, as well as other methods of payment. After you get reputable, you can get better deals easier, and make your own terms easy as well. Also, make sure to meet up in a public place, watch yourself
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:12:10
Not yet, it might go lower friend. But then again, the amount of BTC that it takes to go to 6k is the same as it is to go to 11700. It's a great value nontheless, no need to buy at the exact bottom
@_date: 2018-03-17 22:53:33
Whichever you like me to. But the fact is, by 2020 bitcoin will sort its' scaling solutions and will be far beyond the set number made by an advisor with almost no technical analysis and a strange fundamental one put in the prediction.

It should be deducted, but so far it's all a blur. You have to see a professional accountant and talk to him about it. No one will give you financial advice here and be responsible for the outcome :D.
@_date: 2018-04-18 19:49:22
An interesting fact, but a misleading one as well. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 22:36:07
India wanted to make their own crypto, but the project failed... And now they ban all crypto. These h**s ain't loyal.

Steady hand, cool head. We will prevail.

Save those FUD posts from 2017-2018 guys... It will be a fun read soon.
