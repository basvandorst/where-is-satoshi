Yeah RIGHT NOW. Were you here 2-3 weeks ago when the network had over 250,000 transactions at once? You had to pay $50+ or wait 2-3 days before you got through. When it was at 190,000 I remember having to wait an entire week before my transaction went through, even made a thread about it. People that have less than $30 of Bitcoin cannot even move it LOL, it's a joke.

Can't believe you got downvotes for posting a fact. You can pay $5 but it would take more time, 9 hours sounds generous, I'd push it back to 2-3 days. I've had my transactions stuck for more than a week before, and it was stressful if you're sending large funds around.

Yes you can lose all your funds if a lightning channel fails or a transaction fails or some other bugs occur, says so on the Blockstream website:
"Lightning is still very new and contains known and unknown bugs. In particular, be warned: YOU MAY LOSE FUNDS!" -

Network barely has any transactions going around. Check: 
I remember it being 250,000+ just a few weeks back and fees were $45+.

Nice you sent it while the network congestion was low. Guess you have never experienced BTC congestion before? Send it while the network is in overload and you'll be paying $45 or more per transaction if you want it confirmed within 10 minutes, otherwise you'd be waiting a day or more.

Got it, it worked. Sent something with just $4 fees and it showed up as unconfirmed right away. What is the minimum someone can get by with? Is there a website that can calculate this?
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:29:10
If he puts it on GDAX then GDAX pays for the fees. What if he wants to withdraw his own coins afterwards from his own wallet? How will he pay the fees?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:00:46
no begging dude, this is why you're going to school right?
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:12:41
He can't send it to GDAX from his own wallet. He is trying to move bitcoin out from Coinbase into a different wallet, how does he move it back with the fees if the fees are more than his total coin count?

Nice, another person who got in at 2013 and also didn't buy as many as they should have at the time. UGH. So much for being "Early Adopters" right? Now all the newbies have more BTC than us!
Anyway, awesome story from you mate! Hope your mom gets well soon!
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:56:52
I've had BTC since 2013, how about you?
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:18:46
So I can send something with 0.000005 fees? I think I've done that before and the result was frustration because it was stuck as "Unconfirmed, seen by 0 peers" or something like that, for several days, and my BTC was stuck in limbo.

Bitcoin Cash has burned so many fucking people. It went to .288 and crashed to 0.197 in less than 10 seconds today, I was there watching it liquidate all buy orders from that range and was really glad my computer lagged during that time period or I would've been a bag holder too.

Dude, don't be a retard. I didn't even mention BCH or any of that shit here. I sold them all pretty early. Do I talk about BCH in any of my posts ever?
Can't someone talk about the high transaction fees without fucking being implied as a BCH supporter? You are part of the cancer that is the BTC community. I really don't like the fees, but your kind is worse. GTFO here.

I blocked whatever that guy's name is. Really hate people like that. Can't even have a decent discussion without trolls coming in.
I don't even know why I made this thread if people like that are just going to come in and spam it. This is actually a legitimate story and I'm getting called out for complaining about the high transaction fees lol.

This message has always been there. I signed up more than a month ago and it said the same thing.

Yeah I have a wallet that lets you set fees, but I want to see the transaction right away. I want to sit down, do this transfer, then refresh, and see it coming in right away... I don't think that's too much to ask for since we have hundreds of millions of dollars of hardware supporting the BTC network right now, I don't understand why fees can be so astronomical with that kind of backing.

And yeah if you're keeping up with their development, they have two upcoming forks. One in May, and one in November. They say Graphene is a possible implementation for one of those forks

I mean definitely look at posts like this: 
Guy sold his house and is living off of a credit card in the hopes that Bitcoin becomes $100k so he becomes insanely rich. That's the only purpose Bitcoin has. I don't think he's wrong, some "greater fool" will eventually buy his coins for a higher price, but yeah this is what the space has come down to.
Anyone saying otherwise is in denial.
