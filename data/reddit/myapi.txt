Thank you! I just did some searching around. Unfortunately, my bread wallet says I had no bitcoin when the fork happened which isn’t true, so I’m not sure what to do aha 
Upon clicking claim bch it says I had 0B :(

What is shapeshift

Wait I’m confused ... I have 0.3 bitcoins in my bread wallet and it was there through the swegwit fork which produced bitcoin cash ... do I have some claim to some bitcoin cash?? That can’t be right ....

Sorry ignore me - I'm an idiot. The fork happened on the 1st of August for BCH and my first purchase of bitcoin was on the 20th. Im thinking of Swegit2X which was a soft fork xD I have no claim to an BCH

Maybe they send to the wrong address? They are yours unless you choose to send them back.

TIDL bitcoin enthusiasts are some of the sassiest, most sarcastic people on the planet...

Isn't Segwit changing the actual mining and processing of the currency when you send and bit for it to be included in a block, but your wallet is just your store of currency. Both jaxx and breadwallet are wallets and nothing to do with the process of purchasing and selling currency which segwit effects? 
That's my understanding anyway ...

Not if you mean the grizzly you don't 
@_date: 2017-08-23 09:26:31
The price you are going to sell at? 
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:00:37
Oh ok, so say I purchased £400 worth of BTC, I should get closer to the market value? 
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:04:06
Are you saying this is the dip, or it will continue to go down until 3000ish ... 
@_date: 2017-08-21 00:52:48
What would you recommend which I can access with a UK debit card :) 
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:13:30
I think I just bought too early .. Just spend £80 when people think its going to go further, and they might be right!
Bought at around $3880 :( Should probably wait longer
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:26:45
Hey! I looked at them before but I will definitely have another look. They seem to be selling at higher rates though, for example £3419 was the first hit, when coinbase is £3200 which is still closer to market price, or am I reading it wrong/being stupid xD

Thank you for expanding my vocabulary 
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:15:11
Remindme! 
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:14:19
When is the dip .. IS IT NOW o.o
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:52:10
Yea ... it would be cheaper if I bought more but I was just testing the water- dont think you can get past the network fee 
@_date: 2017-08-21 21:58:52
What are u using to see this / trade 
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:10:11
How would it be devalued in your bredwallet? I'm so confused ....
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:21:37
Thank you! That's amazing. Now I just have to read up on what all the options meanxD trading on margin , limiting all that shabam :) 
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:24:54
You think this is a dip? Its bearly decreased....
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:31:52
I hope so! Tbh, I'm not really dealing with much money �� I only have £88 in bitcoin. Hopefully in the future I will have saved enough to invest £600 max, I just hope I do it at the right time! 
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:54:17
Predict the price will spike? Good to buy now? Surely no one can predict this ...

I too need this answer ....

!remind me
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:57:00
Hi sorry i didnt follow that? Do you mean £10 is so small that the difference in what I thought I was getting and what I got was very small?
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:00:09
Thank you drake66! I was winding then, at larger amounts would I have gotten closer to the market price? is that how it works? Are other exchanges like coin floor similar to this too, as in smaller purchases are not likely to be close to market value?
I dont really have much choice between exchanges as i am from the UK and coinbase is the easiest here without setting up special things in your bank account.
