In order to survive, Core needs to change its PoW, or else Core miners won’t be able to mine at all. I purpose the following, in order to prevent mining centralization, and prevent the possibility of such a governance coup in the future:
Rotating PoW change. Every 3 months (six difficult adjustments), Core will change (via hard fork) it’s PoW algorithm. There will be one month (4032 blocks) of overlap after each change, in which blocks created by both PoWs will be accepted. This will give enough time for upgrade after each PoW change. Every PoW change will reset the clock on any ASIC-ization effort. It will be madness to try to create a matching ASIC, when the PoW is changing every 4 months (1 month for the grace period).
This will completely eliminate the current situation in which two companies (BitmainTech and BitFury) can control over 90% of the hash-rate.
The mining playing field will be leveled again and the barrier of entry for mining will lowered. Everyone with money and access to low cost electricity will be able to mine. There will be no need to buy 16nm ASICs from BitFury at $13 per unit, when BitFury cost is $3 per ASIC (my estimation).
In order to avoid corruption in the selection of PoW algorithms, I also suggest that a committee of 5 individuals will be formed, with each individual serving a term of four algorithm changes (one year), with staggered cycles so the committee is not changed all at once. The preference will be to use complex algorithms, with multiple sub algorithms (e.g. X11 style), and the constants in each should be selected randomly from the block-chain data leading up to each rotation. As this is merely a suggestion for community consideration, I do not presume to define selection criteria for the committee members.
What about BotNets ?
Back in 2012 it was a real issues. These days there are entities with huge amount of GPUs. BotNets will be just another player. In my estimation they will be one of the smaller ones.
I'm also working on a non manual way to do it, but it's much harder.

Is there a vid archive of the event ?
@_date: 2016-01-21 08:15:39
No problem at all.
I'm working on a proposal for a rotating PoW that will prevent the ability to use ASICs. Core will always use GPUs

Classic decided against PoW change: 
Core must do it to survive, after Classic Activation. It also needs to change Transaction ID to split the coins completely into ClassicCoin and CoreCoin
Let the market decide Smiley
@_date: 2016-01-21 07:19:44
Can it be Core and Classic instead of Core vs Classic ?
My discussion with Jonathan Toomim in "Miner In World" WeChat group.
I'm working on a proposal for a rotating PoW changes to allow Core to survive Classic activation and bring an era of endless GPU mining to Core.
Please take the time to read it and comment.
@_date: 2016-01-21 07:33:29
That was Jonathan opinion as well.
However, it seems very likely that Classic Activation threshold will be met.
Some Core developers will continue to work on Core but on Classic chain (after the successful governance change coup)
But some Core developers will want to continue to work on Core but on Core chain. In order to do that, they must Hard Fork and change PoW. It's all covered in the discussion log.
@_date: 2016-01-21 07:21:46
As Olivier Janssens told me: “Competition is good”. So let the market decide.
We’ll have an interesting dichotomy:
Classic will have democratic governance but centralized, ASIC based mining.
Core will have meritocratic governance but democratic, GPU based mining.

The MinerInWorld log is very long (4.5 hours of chat...), but it's very good read, IMHO. It demonstrate how 2 people - Olivier Janssens and Marshall Long successfully (so it seems) were able to do a governance change. Amazing stuff.

Sure. In any case, since you are an engineer, go over my calculations of the savings. It's very easy to understand them.

Mining isn't low margin business. Far, far from it. Please read the following:  and also the following:

All what you wrote here isn't relevant to ASICBOOST and the subject of the OP.
@_date: 2017-05-31 19:38:18
The devs, including luke-jr knows that ASICBOOST is red herring and BS. It doesn't prevent them to use it to push for BIP148.
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:28:47
Except BitFury.
@_date: 2017-05-31 22:50:27


no it's not. read the two articles links I gave above.
The hash algorithm itself IS implemented by ASIC. Many optimizations are involved.

Xilinx® Zynq®-7000 (
Still, it's not enough. Those Merkle Collisions computations are massive, even in the reduced form Gregory found.
I was the CEO of Spondoolies-Tech. In our SP50 design, we allocated one SHA engine in each of the machine 800 ASICs to achieve it. Gregory's method is more efficient, but still very costly.
@_date: 2017-05-31 19:51:57
There is no covert ASICBoost in any BitmainTech machines.
Gregory Maxwell knows that.
The machines have generic support for ASICBoost which you can use in both ways. To use the Covert Mode Gregory Maxwell thought they are using, you need another 130mm ASIC on the miner board. You can't do that with FPGA.
In any case, the savings from ASICBoost, overt or covert are nothing:
Luke-Jr knows it very well. And so does Gregory.
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:53:16
SegWit signaling issue isn't related. It's part of the political struggle and layer 1 vs layer 2 solutions which I don't want to get into them here. I will just say that in the NY agreement client, SegWit will be deployed as well. And yes, it will block ASICBOOST.
Mining empty blocks aren't related to covert ASICBOOST. It's probably some kind of pool size optimization they are doing. I am guessing it give them some kind of advantages in some situations.
@_date: 2017-05-31 22:36:44
No. All the ASICs on the hashing boards are the same, 1387 16nm mining ASIC.
btw, Gregory Maxwell didn't reverse engineered this ASIC as well.

Regarding "You can do anything with an FPGA":
FPGA has a limited amount of logic cells. You can't implement anything with FPGA. You can implement only a design that fits inside the specific FPGA you have chosen. The FPGA on the S9 machines is too small to implement Covert ASICBOOST logic. To do it, you will need either a huge costly FPGA, or to tapeout low-cost 130nm ASIC. In any case, it's a mute point. The saving in terms of electricity from an ASICBOOST (overt or covert) are about 15% and it doesn't even move the needle to BitmainTech:

The analysis is quite accurate and on the lower edge of my estimations regarding BitmainTech profitability. I was the CEO of Spondoolies-Tech, we loose to BitmainTech, fair and square. Not related to ASICBOOST which we also were aware of and incorporated in our SP50 design.

(I was involved in HK agreement and was one of the signees)
The scaling conflict related to conflict of interests between layer 1 based solutions (and fees) and layer 2 various scaling solutions.
It's not related at all to ASICBOOST and the OP.
I don't want to get into it here, it's not relevant.

It's not the same thing. I offer an ideological hard-liners core supporter a PR opportunity to set a low value for UAHF coins, in advance.
@_date: 2017-06-16 07:33:08
It was cynical. Spondoolies went bankrupt in mid 2016.
@_date: 2017-06-16 07:07:09
why? it's not about doing money for the other side of the trade. It's about ideology. The low value is on purpose, it helps their cause.
