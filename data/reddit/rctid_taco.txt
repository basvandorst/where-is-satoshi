Bitcoin is a store of value. Always has been. That it remains stable while everything else fluctuates wildly is just further proof of that, you dolt.

The person who sold you your BTC didn't lose...
If you wanted "fiat" instead of BTC why did you buy BTC?
(Rhetorical question of course. You bought BTC because you thought you could sell it to someone later for more than you bought it for. Presumably that person would intend to sell it to yet another person who would pay even more for it. Ad infinitum. The problem is you don't actually want BTC. Neither do the other people. They just want someone else to want it. Eventually someone has to get stuck holding the bag and unless the price rallies again it looks like that person is you.)

You bought in at the right time. If you look at this graph it's pretty clear BTC will approach $10,000 by the end of this year. Next year, probably $100k. By the end of 2030 it should be flirting with $1 quintillion for a market cap of around $20 septillion. I for one look forward to being a sextillionaire. By the turn of the century we'll be looking at a market cap exceeding $10^32 vigintillion. We'll have to wait for 2105 for the market cap to reach $1 googol. At that point the smallest possible bitcoin transaction will be worth $5x10^85 so they'll only be useful for buying Dogecoin and large planets.
