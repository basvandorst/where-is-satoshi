Even “stable coins” aren’t really stable...just theoretically stable.

Nice! I’m going to send them a message too

Hey! Accountant here who specialized in taxes for 5 years and worked for the IRS. I can tell you that the amount you are speaking of is immaterial even tho your conversion activity does trigger a taxable event. The IRS is going after heavy hitters.

Some advice...mine by yourself...you don’t need some scammer.
@_date: 2019-08-23 13:16:31
That’s messed up

I hear you. Depending on how much it is, someone may ask, but you can easily prove it. I understand how exhausting auditors can be. Many are embarrassed to have to ask the stupid questions they seem to come back with all the time, but are prompted to ask questions spit out from a system process. You’ll be okay. You might think you have a lot, but there are some individuals who have cashed out millions on BTC and haven’t paid a single dime into taxes and these are the people the IRS is really trying to track down. I understand how some of these taxpayers feel...I mean...taxation is pretty much theft ����‍♂️ but unfortunately it is the system we have in place.

I trying to scramble for money right now to buy again. Such a great price
@_date: 2019-08-28 17:12:32
That’s correct. However, the idea is that Bitcoin will become increasingly more valuable.
@_date: 2019-08-16 18:04:53
Oh my bad! I read through fast, but I now see you didn’t actually convert anything back to USD. You’re good man! Think of BTC as property or stock. As long as you hold it and don’t convert back to USD, you don’t have a taxable event. In your case, there’s no taxable event.

Funny, I just bought a shit ton about 90 mins ago. Maybe some of your bitcoins traveled over to my wallet ��
@_date: 2019-10-25 16:34:11
Why’d you sell? I think even at 8500 it’s a great price ����

Would Compound or Nuo crypto lending be options for you to borrow? 
Compound is an open-source, autonomous protocol built for developers, to unlock a universe of new financial applications. Interest and borrowing, for the open financial system.

Definitely a safe bet that it won’t. If anything I think it will continue to slide into the 6K range

I’m going to laugh so hard if by some strange coincidence bitcoin skyrockets during Friday 13th.

Let’s introduce bitcoin to plants while you’re at it. Something simple like when the plant wants to grow an extra limb it spends some bitcoin or when it needs to grow fruit or something.

I’m a pretty avid stock trader that has traded quite well within my personal portfolio through the years. I am absolutely for BTC and other crypto’s. I think the problem is there are a LOT of boomers who don’t understand blockchain technology and how a lot of these other cryptocurrencies operate and in my personal experience (I meet with older individuals regarding their trades) they refuse to learn about cryptos and tokens. I think it ultimately comes down to a combination of laziness and lack of education.

I won’t...my rigs are warming my house during these cold winter months. lol
