Based? Texas? haha I hope thats what you were asking. Yea I'll probably try again when my birthday comes around and give it another go. I only have used breadwallet to deal with bitcoin but I'll definitely look into coinbase and GDAX when I do!

Gahhh I know I see that now I don't know why I assumed ads were legit. I was just being impulsive :(((

Live and learn I guess... My short-lived bitcoin adventure is over. I'm not terribly upset since the only reason I had that much $ worth is because the value went up. I really only put a fraction of that in a while ago. It's just sad to think of what could've been :(

Yea haha I'm looking at the email and the website's "testimonials" and there are a bunch of red flags. One of the testimonials is "very quickly..Thank you!"  Appreciate the list! I'll use one of those if I ever buy more.. Thanks :)

I searched "selling bitcoin" and it was the second result...I think you're right. Yea I was doing it in the middle of class and kinda in a hurry. Bummer

How'd you contact the FBI to file a report? I'd like to do that as well.

I'm new at this I had gotten 60$ worth a while back and the value had increased when I remembered I had it. I assume people here are more informed about the trading/selling process, so I came looking for help. The website was one of the first results online and it seemed legit. I'm just curious if anyone else has any more info on it
