You won’t see 20k again in the next 10 years, don’t worry.

Listen we all have our hustle, but you have to understand your word is as good as trash on the internet. I’m just bewildered at the fact that there are sick kids dying of cancer or legitimately fucked up individuals that could use a hand out more then you ever could. I understand life got tough for you, it does for us all at times. You did what you had to do, that’s your business. I wanted to share my opinion on how I saw this thread going and actually amazed that the mods are letting this even slide. You were clever enough to never lost a BTC address asking openly for donations so your post went through filters nicely. And I’m sure all those people PMing you asking for your wallet are all getting different addresses so no one can see what you might take in. Just my opinion I’m entitled to it as you are yours. Good luck to you in life, harden that skin losing .1 BTC isn’t the worst that’ll happen in your life. Imagine giving birth to a sick child or getting sick yourself. You’ll end up saying fuck BTC, and that’s just to put life in perspective for you.

Why you come to tell us? We have our own bills and families and responsibilities. Maybe someone will empathize with you and open their wallet to you, as you hoped right?

I lost my 1 year old. Life and people have died a long time ago.

I’m sure you will. Hell, you’ll probably make double what you originally had with all the free tips your getting on just this thread. Tomorrow make one about how your dog ate your recovery seed :)!
= profit.

Why post the same question 2 months prior?

World dies to you. I cashed out awhile ago, but have been a stone to much of everyday life after it. Count your blessings, and kiss and hug your children everyday.
