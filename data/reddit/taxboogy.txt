You are absolutely wrong.

Using your own logic, where is your evidence?
@_date: 2018-11-20 23:01:18
I agree, $1200-ish is the real value. Yes, it can grow to $5000 or even $20000, but not in a week or two like a year ago.

The problem is that many of those guys people call trolls were bitcoin enthusiasts in the beginning. They have seen all the bitcoin faucets, casinos, coupons for bitcoin, coffees for bitcoin, lambos for bitcoin, domains for bitcoins, steam for bitcoin, China's overtake, first chin--up-higher-than-everest "experts" (damn I hate the word so much) ... they have seen the time where bitcoin was useful and they see the time now, when it is not. I used to buy things with bitcoin now I hodl. And I am 100% honest when I say that bitcoin failed. It was an interesting experiment, but

**revolutionary**... spirit ;D
Seriously, though, I will wait a week or two for the 1000-2000 range and then buy. It seems that it will be falling at least a thousand $/€ more.

Dude, I am folowing this *cryptovia* since its beginning. Bitcoin is not the future. I am using Ethereum for practical things every fucking day, Bitcoin not at all. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:46:44
I am selling and buying in a week or two. That way I will have at least some Christmas. The price is going down. My advice is sell now, buy some presents for your family and buy cheaper after Christmas. Merry Christmas.

Please, visit Gypsy families in Eastern Europe. They live in very bad conditions. They are malnutritioned, children are sold to pedophiles. This year they had 200 cases of measles. It's very bad.
@_date: 2018-12-03 13:31:27
What about helping Gypsies instead?
Or they are not poor enough?
 
@_date: 2018-12-07 13:55:59
Wrong. sell and buy when it will be around 1000. Hodling is a missed opportunity.
@_date: 2018-12-07 09:50:03
Not much. About 10k. I am little mad that I didn't sell more last year.
@_date: 2018-12-04 10:57:39
I have seen it in the past many times. This is not the first time. What is even more strange that I can§t find any search results with this problem. I have tried "google results 1970" but there is nothing. Can you try it on your computer whether you will get something or not?
@_date: 2018-12-04 10:55:59
I saw that many times before. Maybe it's the ublock origin extension, but, for example, now, I can't get the epoch time again, I tried any bitcoin phrase combination like before and it is not working anymore. It's weird.
EDIT: I was wrong. Score!

No, the future is bleak.

Everything. Look [at China]( ;)

Because they are idiots/out-of-touch people. Gold is forever. Bitcoin is not.

Stilllll 10x better then all those "eying", "plunge", "plummet" non-sense random-generated titles on all them "real" crypto news webzzz.

It will go to 1000-ish level in a few months. Now it's good time to sell, however, if you want to buy, just wait a few weeks or months and the price will be much better - around the 1500 - 1200 range.
@_date: 2018-12-07 14:15:22
Is it a question or a statement?

Bitcoin got rid off all the useful thing in the early versions. Now it's justa useless deadweight. Ethereum and other "smart" projects are far more useful.
@_date: 2018-12-07 14:31:09
The more fancy words the bigger bullshit. 
If you are a native speaker, it might be less noticable, however, for a non native speaker it's easy to spot when somebody tries to sugarcoat and deceive things with the language. It's rather comical, really.
Have a nice day.
@_date: 2018-12-07 10:20:00
Sell. The price will go down in the next 6 months or more. You can buy for 1500 or less in 6 months easily.
The people who tell you to hodl are missing opportunities.
@_date: 2018-12-06 15:01:06
In Euros it was almost 2,999 a few minutes ago.

Crypto is a scam. Programmers who didn't get it are weird. Are you a programmer? Have you ever done a real time multiplayer game or app?
@_date: 2018-12-04 16:16:40
The question is how long can you go? What if there is something better than Bitcoin in a few years. In my opinion the 20,000 was the maximum. The future of Bitcoin is about 1,000 per coin. Despite many promises nobody except a few people use Bitcoin. Bitcoin is hard to use when compared with ApplePay or SamsungPay etc. And you can get a refund or freeze your assets when somebody hack your account etc. Bitcoin was great and useful in 2013 and maybe 2014, not now. And the problem is that it is going more and more complicated to use not easier and easier.

Bitcoin is going to shit. You don't paint a cryptocurrency gold if you think gold is useless. Think about it. Gold is still king.
