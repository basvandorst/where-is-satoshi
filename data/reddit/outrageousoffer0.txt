I imagine you know in sci-fi movies where the people have a device about the size of a cell phone and they put it to the back of someone elses device to transfer money. you would figure that would be the set up. If it was I would use it more often.
Could just use stable coins to replace the dollar. and if you wanted to take a little risk you could venture into BTC and alt coins for gains or losses lol.
IDK how that gets towards solving your taxing issue on each transaction. But, the end goal for lots of people in the crypto community is to get away from ever going back to fiat. To create a peer to peer exchange of value that surpasses the current monetary system. If you don't convert you aren't playing the banks game. Even thou I would be naive to think the banks aren't involved here.

Use [crypto.com]( if you are in the USA, supports lots of other regions other than the USA. Only state it doesn't work in is New York.
free to buy a sell for ACH pulls, but 3.5% if you use a debit/credit card.
If you really want to use the App, you get 50$ of MCO when you stake 50 MCO. Ill put my reference ID incase you do decide to go ahead with that. You also get free spotify when your staking 50 MCO for 6 months. Give you a cool metal debit card called the ruby steel.

Don't feel pressured to use [crypto.com]( but I am really impressed with their services and can help answer more questions if you have any about the team.

use KuCoin you can buy and trade BNB there...
the VPN on binance won't work because you have to do a KYC to still trade...
