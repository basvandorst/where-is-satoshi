The resources in this community exist to reclaim what was in mtgox in full and then some.  Saying anything is gone is for the weak hearted.  Think of how bitcoin came to where it is today... People from all over with one idea.  One goal.  One objective.  Because bitcoin.   
Let mtgox die,  no you're mistaken... Why?  Because bitcoin.  Pack up and move on... No why?  Because bitcoin.   Understand that no government backs bitcoin... So who does?..  The world does...  Because bitcoin.
Bitcoin doesn't have a business plan,  there's no milestones to reach.  It just is. If you support bitcoin then you are responsible for the whole thing.
 who backs bitcoin?  The foundation,  mom and pop shops accepting the coin. No, everyone backs bitcoin.  There's no pointing fingers at governing bodies in this game.  You see.. You don't just say mtgox was bad,  acted irresponsibly, and that you never supported them, and that's not what bitcoin is about...   because you do support bitcoin so in turn mtgox is a part of that system.    We're all responsible here.  if you partook in bitcoin you partook in mtgox.   Silk Road, scam artist,  thieves,  are all in the same system.  Accept that, and then when it makes you mad enough to say "No I will not allow that!"  You will know what you're fighting for.  Bitcoin was given to be your network, your protocol and you accepted it, and that's when your fight began.  because bitcoin.

Do This:  It's a secluded setting (Airfield, Warehouse, on a Yaht, in the desert etc).  You have a football briefcase with "electronic jobbie doos" and it's a scene straight outta a james bond movie, where theres two men doing a transfer and in the briefcase is the computer that connects and verifies the transfer of cash with biometrics, key codes etc. to verify the parties.  After a very brief but serious conversation to, see if either man has brought their end of the deal.. They do electronic bank transfer through the briefcase computer, but then the computer spits out a date on when the funds will be available.  Turns out they did the deposit after banking hours and there is a 5 day hold (as the men look at their watches)... It ends with them just sitting there tapping their fingers, and one of them says "have you ever heard of bitcoin?"

They did a spinoff.  They got their clients to use OKpay knowingly it would be for bitcoin only to Mtgox and others.  Then they offered to sell bitcoin but realized they can't compete with Mtgox and other exchanges so they seized the flow of funds in and out to their competition.... 
If your money is in OKpay, you must use them to buy bitcoin and cannot use another exchange.  That or, wire transfer out in fiat.

1.) maybe the whole, "replace USD... etc" is not the approach that should be had.... Bitcoin is jelly and USD is peanut butter that makes a good sandwich...
2.) don't sell bitcoin, because generally things that are "sold" to people are not needed.  Rather it may be better to combat false reasoning against or infavor of bitcoin.  It seems the lack of understanding leads to fear which may not be good... because in time of fear people look at their leaders and expect them to take control.

I think the platform of bitcoin is being missed in this discussion on regulation, given that, I think any regulation is easier said than done on BTC.   One argument. With violent crime we see escalation.  Criminals with guns, then cops with more guns.  Then criminals with bigger guns and cops with more bigger guns.  Now imagine the same fight with bitcoin anonymity.  If the government isn't going to be getting revenue or votes for bitcoin regulation then why bother with another resource sucking set of authority?  
They're gonna work what they have (fincen) into regulation because it doesn't call for mass changes in protocol.  But taking it further is gonna need a big budget, so something's gonna get cut or get increased, then when that comes, whose gonna explain bitcoin?

I need to know your dispute resolution process, terms and conditions.  After being involved in an escrow dispute using a BTC purchase, I ended up with 80% and was not happy, since the other party was a complete scam.  I also noticed that the escrow service moderating the dispute was to get paid on a percentage of the completed sale.  So in the end I lost over 20% (he did not refund shipping)  and the escrow provider and scam artist made money off of me.  Plus the dispute lasted months.  I have the full scenario I can forward to you if it helps to in anyway prevent scams from happening to others...

I would recommend going with bitpay or coinbase if you're new to bitcoin. (The payees might feel more confident when they see your using either of the two, and you will get added support) Then if you understand the concept and way it works more substantially, it might be better to integrate your own system to rule out the middle man.  All in all I would stress to choose the system that is the easiest for the payee to use.

I dunno if anybody remember that FB! report that came out 1 yr ago, and how it mentioned that btc exchanges could be considered "money Transmitters", but it wasn't clear, as even the Fb! report considered Fincen to be uncertain.  I saw this coming, Bam! one year later here it is.
See: In July 2011 FinCEN revised the definition of “money transmission service” to mean “the acceptance of
currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency from one person and the transmission of currency,
funds or other value to another location or person by any means.” It is likely that the business models of many
third-party bitcoin services qualify them as money transmitters, and therefore money services businesses (MSB),
under 31 CR Part 1010.100(ff)(5)."

Banks love charging fees.  I worked at two bank branches from when the doors first opened and Fees are a big part of bread and butter of their profit.  Sure there are deposit goals and lending goals.  But to open a Demand Deposit acct (checking acct) it was costing us just over $70 (u know those free checking gimmicks)... but it was known we would make that back in fees...
And I don't know why anybody would charge someone for not having money... (rejecting your transaction and then charging you)

Record with video: PUtting miner in box, sealing box, applying postage and dropping in mailbox.  Do this all in one take at the Post Office, making sure to note the weight of the package.  
Then  Make sure after you withdraw the funds from paypal (25 day waiting period may apply),  un-link your paypal account from your bank account or link a new bank account and close it.  Paypal can deduct the money from you directly if a dispute is filed without prior notice if your account falls into their Guidelines.

Hello,  Have you started your Business on the escrow process yet?... 5 months is a while, I hope all is well...  I agree that there should be no split decisions.  In my case, I purchased 1 oz of gold, and the issue was that when the package arrived there was no gold..  So to prove my case, the most precise thing to do was weigh out everything in the package.  I even provided video of the weighing of the items using an official USPS scale at the post office.  I even called the Swedish post office and discovered what post office the seller used and that He handed the package to him over the counter, (proving that the weight was accurate and that the package was never tampered with).  I'll explain,  All the package contents equaled the weight exactly, when added up individually, as stated on the postage... So how is this possible if there is 1 oz of gold missing.... It means the package was never weighed with the gold inside during the time the postage was affixed.  All postal system abides by international weights and measures... I attempted to use this standard to prove my case... Unfortunately the 3rd party was not very good at any due diligence.
 One thing I will recommend is to not use past feedback (from purchases) of either side as any form of credibility...  Scammers use a great system to bump up their feedback by false and legit small purchases for a big sting in the future...  I can send you the case in a word doc.  If you want to remain anonymous, use a ten day mail accnt and I can forward the whole file to you.

OTC trade is easier.
I first started buying on OTC and took an hour to get my first coin, and transfer through dwolla instantly.  
Start to finish using coinbase for example, u won't get the same result in an hour.
Trade volume looks to be the highest when the price drops, and it just means more fees paid to the exchanges.

I've done this before. Here's what happened.
PayPal would hold funds for up to twenty one days.  
PayPal would charge back my account after 21 days and I would get a loss.  Lots of scammers used either hacked PayPal accounts and some even just flat out lied.
when I figured out  a way to expedite the hold and withdraw the funds, PayPal would manually hold transactions based on my "increased activity" on the account.  Shortly after that happened they suspended my Paypal account.  Then while an amount of money was still held in PayPal, chargebacks kept coming through. But not because of the client, but PayPal themselves would dispute the transaction weeks later on no merit. 
If you register your items as currency, like you shipping gold coins, then PayPal requires u to file AML protocol, KYC and other items like a business plan

any alternative method will probably get your listings taken down.   I had my own merchant card processing terminal at one point, linked my website to, my eBay posting to, the checkout and ebay wouldn't have it.
However I'm not saying its impossible.  I would throw a QR code in the image with the item like in the corner, with a little sign that says BTC.  Then record the sale in ebay as a money order, if you still want to record it to pay their fees.
Putting these changes in the image helps to prevent it from getting flagged.  the admin system will pick up key words in the text.

Since this site doesn't allow you to credit or debit in bitcoins,  would it ever contribute to the market value of BTC?  It seems to be strictly for speculation and is somewhat like a bucket shop, since there is no regulatory authority seeing to it that these buy/sell transactions actually take place.
@_date: 2013-04-29 15:12:19
CFD is almost another name for a BucketShop.  These trades will never affect the BTC price on any other exchange, since you can't transfer out.  
This won't add liquidity, because they're not trading actual BTC and probably don't have any BTC holds.  
It could reduce volatility because speculators can flock to this to take advantage of the leverage and sell feature.

I'm guessing that unlike other exchanges, you will not be able to transfer out your bitcoin "open positions". Would be nice to be able to leverage 100 BTC positions at a tenth of the price to then transfer out to another exchange . Lol. I don't see this working, and the volatility of the market combined with the levered accounts could work against them.  I do hope they prove me wrong.

I see you have one person listing.  They are going through paypal.  I would be careful because paypal lets you refuse transactions weeks after completion.
Also I'm guessing since each person needs to put at risk a certain amount, they have to value what the transaction is worth to them.
Here's an example with the current listing...
I pay 4 USD to whoever.  They say they don't receive it and blow up the box  "KabOOm!" 2 LTC gone - it would be cool to have a noise like that--- .  
They (the Crypto Seller)  looses 1 LTC and leaves with 4 USD and 1 LTC.  
I (the Buyer) loose  4 USD and 1 LTC.  In this scenario the Crypto seller exchanged his Currency for Fiat anonymously.   And the buyer is SOL.  Assuming the transaction can go both ways, don't you see this as a problem?  let's say the amount at risk is even 120% of the transaction, that could still entice some scammers.
