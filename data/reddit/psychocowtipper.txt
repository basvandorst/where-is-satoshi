I take it you haven't been to the [churning subreddit](  The whole philosophy of churning is taking advantage of the 'one time offers' of credit cards.  Lots of cards exist that would make up for the 4% fee.  I used [this]( one last year.  The 50,000 points were worth approximately $750, and if I had used 100% of the $4000 spend for cryptocurrency I would have only paid $160 in fees ($4000 * 4%).  
Another thing to keep in mind is that you still have to pay a fee (1.5%) when paying with a bank account.  So you only have to overcome the 2.5% difference to make it worth it, not the full 4%.

Which is only true if you have a card that gives you 1% cashback and nothing else.  What if you have a card that gives a better rate?  What if your card gives you a signup bonus that is worth more than the 3.99%?

If you are earning rewards worth more than the fees then of course it makes sense.  For example, if you sign up for a credit card that gives you 50,000 reward points for signing up and doing a minimum spend then you can convert them to cash back on your credit card statement and cover the fee difference and then some.  Another advantage of using a credit card is that it is instant, so if you plan to buy ETH on coinbase and immediately trade it for DASH at the current exchange rate, you can do so.  If you use a bank account, you'll be receiving your ETH 5-10 days later and then the DASH/ETH pair may have a vastly different trade rate.
