Why have you stored your bitcoins on coinbase? I thought people only used it to buy bitcoins and send it directly to an address with an private key you control.
@_date: 2014-07-09 15:26:10
In the Netherlands too. We even have an political party called '50+'. Babyboomers are a big part of society, so they are growing very quick. All they care about is maintaining their social structure until they are death. They even advertising with pictures of grandpa's holding a baby with the texture below "a good pension for young and old", while they very well understand that this is impossible for the 'young'.
@_date: 2014-02-25 11:35:44
I know. This is one of the reasons to accept bitcoins in stores located in high criminal profiled neighborhoods. The private key could be in the fault at the store, at the HQ or somewhere else. Probably directly send to a bitpay like company.
@_date: 2014-08-11 18:16:27
I dont think you can ELI5 with the graph, but I always try to explain it like this:
The private key creates the public key. Thats also why you need to bruteforce addresses to find/create a finity address. So lets say the private key is 3+9, you know the public key is 12. But when you know the public key is 12, do you know the private key? 6+6, 5+7, 1+4+2+5? You dont know, and the formula of a bitcoin public key is way more complex that your computer will never find out. I dont know if this is even a littlebit accurate,but thats how I explain
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:54:09
Yes, the private key is like the banknotes connected to the gold and silver in the fault. The only difference is that you can look in the fault everytime you want for not getting scammed with fake notes. Today we have papergold in the goldmarket. There is 112x more papergold in circulation than there exists in the hard gold market.

@_date: 2014-07-13 10:29:52
Lol thats way more complex than I thought. I alway thought the public key = the bitcoin address, and the private key is the sum of the bitcoin address/public key. So if you dumb it down and say the private key is 6+8, the public key is 14. But you don't know if 14 = 6+8 or 5+9 or 7+7 ext..

The thing is, the government from a country will NEVER decide to make bitcoin its national currency and you shouldn't want it.
At first they won't do it because they cant control it. At second, it will end the consumerist dept based economic system, because it isn't inflationary.
It will cause bankruptcies from a lot of pointless company and its jobs. After that it will crush everyones pensions, unemployment and other social(istic) securities people (still) depending on. People won't be able to sell their houses or pay their (housing) debts. [People are still hopelessly depending on this system, that they will fight it and kill these politicians and their families]( Also countries won't be able to fund their wars anymore and in an abrupt change, also not their defenses.
The reason why you shouldn't want it is because the government debt will also be converted in bitcoins. The aim of all policymakers is to prevent deflation and create inflation. So that the fair value of the enormous debt (but also our savings!) shrinks. With a deflationary currency, the value of the governments debts will grow. The one who will pay for this is you.
ONLY the people can decide to adopt bitcoin. People who stay out of debt and will take the care of their health and future in their own hands. Or with others in their own community. Their government debt can stay in an infinite loop of borrowing and spending outside the real economy.

Bluetooth worked fine on my early sony ericsson phones when phones didn't had internet connection. 1 click and it was on/off and people nearby could connect with my phone in a few seconds. Later (Iguess at 2.0) they messed it up by adding some 'security' to it that made it shut down after 60 sec and needed to enter a PIN 2 times on both devises.
We dont use handsfree payments in fiat transactions either and i dont think people would like it. In my country we (recently) have NFC(like) terminals. when you put your debit card against it, you can make payments below 25€ without entering a PIN. No one likes it and is scared about theft or privacy. The paypal-BTLE thing in Bitcoin would probably only work trough a trusted 3rd party when I look at the youtube video's about it.

The last 2 boosts where during financial instability in the euro zone. march/april 2013 becouse of Cyprus and all the other southern countries where about to follow. And last November becouse the ECB dropped the borrow fees for banks with 50% from 0,5% to 0,25%. I think there is a high chance that the next boost will be after the EU (s) elections.

Yoe're right. At the last bitcoin meetup in my country we talked with some journalist from a main stream media who where attendant, because of the mostly negative and wrong news they are reporting. They told us to the group (it was an presentation) that they need a story out in at least half a day and sometimes in like 2 hours (when Mt.Gox crashed). Even if they never heard about Bitcoin. On the other hand, negative news and unfolded secrets like "who is the real SN?" gets more views. More views is more income trough advertisements. And if you don't bring up enough money, you're out! It's the complete system thats wrong. Just like the economy based on fiat. there needs to be an disruptive innovation like bitcoin for journalism.

I have 42% of my portfolio in bitcoin. My bitcoins are now 34% down compared to USD. Just like OP, I'm also not intending to sell any BTC for fiat, only if I need fiat to buy a house. I have bitcoin because I believe its future and as a store of value. Not for gaining some quick fiat. The last 2 spikes were (mainly) caused by financial instability in the EU (Cyprus and ECB rate halved to 0,25%). I think there will be some big problems during the next EU (s)elections that could make the next spike. If its not, there will be one in the future because the fiat system is rotten. Also, the last 2 spikes where broken mainly because of the problems at Mt.GoX. Mt.GoX is gone now so it cant fk things up anymore. There is also a lot of competition between the exchanges and there are a lot of bitcoin entrepreneurs creating software and hardware to make bitcoin easier for the average joe. The next boost will be big. I'm hodling.

**Edit:** Come one everyone. bruce_fenton has a valid point. Its not nice if you put some hard effort to **entertain someone** (movies, books, amusement parks, paintings) and don't get something in return besides a compliment. Its something completely different than sharing pieces of information. The cam and torrenting is more like a joke, hoping the creators realize they better put it on the internet in exchange for bitcoins. I think pieces of art (movies, documentaries, amateur videos, books, museums, wallpapers, graffiti, streetpaintings) can be funded in more modern ways. Bitcoin can become a great tool for it.

That GHash.io is more profitable is short term and riskless thinking. Lets say GHash has a 40% share in the hashrate distribution and the BTCguild 20%. Ghash gets an average of mining 2 out of 5 blocks and BTCguild 1/5 of the blocks. If you have one epic mining rig that you provide 10% of the BTCguilds mining power, you'll only provide 5% of the mining power of Ghash when join that pool. Your share in the mined bitcoins will be 50% lower. In this case you'll get with both pools an average of 0.5BTC/block. 25x10%x20% for BTCguild and 25x5%x40% for Ghash.  
Yes you'll get your bitcoins at Ghash faster, but when you mine 24/7 it wouldn't be a big of a deal. you'll only increase the risk that your pool will grow that big that it could mess up the system and make your mined bitcoins worthless.

* "What if i want some extra natural recourses from that big computer to build a big (polluting) spaceship?"
* "What if a 1000 (or 100,000) people want to live on [this cliff]( all alone in peace?"
* "What if I want all the gold in the world to build a big screen to block the Earth from the sun? Because I'm just very enterprising with a messed-up mind and not a lazy fuck like all the others in those prison cities, doing absolutely nothing but eating and die."

If you dont like it, you can use the pre-installed Bitaddress.org script or install another generator.
I bought the piper wallet because I wanted a small offline computer for securing my bitcoins, creating new addresses **and** create paper wallets. It was cheap for me because you can pay with bitcoin and the worth has risen 5x that time since i bought them. I have a pretty modern regular printer with memory and internet connection, so if i created my own cold storage and wanted to print them, i had to buy a new printer too.

If OP or someone else could explain it in both why&gt; how&gt;what and tha what&gt;how&gt;why way, would be helpful. I only see 'why', because we need to go back to something like physical gold/silver. But gold and silver is not useful in this fast and globalized world. The what is bitcoin and how by mass adoption.
Edit: also, gold can easy be manipulated and i believe we can modify molecules easily to something else in like 70 years.

I dont know how they are gonna do it, but i don't think its a big problem. They only need proof once that you live in that counrty. They dont need harmful data and really dont need to save it. I guess people without a computer can name someone to take care of there coins. Just like with fiat is possible. A government will never come forward wit a national altcoin. They dont want to lose that much power. I dont see it as the holy grail and see more future in auroracoin than spaincoin because of the technological infrastructure.

I have my storage bitcoins on encrypted paper wallets with 5btc each. The paper wallets are created offline. They are also on a fire proof usb that never touched the Internet or a computer with internet connection. I have changed the .txt with the keys to .exe called 'trojanvirus_0.13.9.exe' inside a .rar. I don't think anyone will open that. If you change it to .txt its readable again. the paper and usb are stored outside the house. They are encrypted with an avarage of 40 characters each.

Because "flooding" social media and news is a bit hostile. Also calling apple 'anti-tech'. An OS announcement is not a Q&amp;A session, so you don't get any reply. All you'll get is that people who dont understand bitcoin yet are thinking, "what are those bitcult members doing? lets just ignore them." If you like apple products and like bitcoin simultaneously, you can just ask them politely at the right place/forum. Spamming on SM or at news articles just don't work to make apple bitcoin friendly.

As far as I understand trough [this video](
The merchant is already connected with your BTLE signal and Paypal account when you enter or walks nearby the store and download automatically your connected profilepic. When the costumer says "I want to pay with Paypal", the merchant checks the BTLE connections and will search for your picture. After that, the merchant writes your payment form your account. I think this development is nice for people who dont care about their privacy and trusts every merchant they see.
I dont think its save for bitcoin. Even through paypal like trusted 3rd parties. But the idea a costumer can pay without connecting the internet could be very useful I think.

Its not like a stock, but a store of value. You have to compare it to something you buy a lot. Lets say beer. 6 months ago i could buy with 0.1BTC about 4 beers. Its now 12 beers. That difference is a lot. You can do the same with different fiat currencies.  Before the crisis 2USD was like 3EUR. Now its almost the other way around. But because BTC have a limited inflation and becouse its new, the fluctuations are more extreme.

For me:
**1) End 2010**. Red about it in an article saying 'this could be really big' and I was thinking: "yeah right, internet money will probably been copied, hacked or blocked by the government. But it sounds interesting. Btw I have some monsters to kill in in that computer game." I only checked the exchange rates. It was around $0.10 and thought, "thats not much".
**2) 2011**. I encountered Bitcoin again and checked what happened over the past year. It seems some criminal had been paid out in Bitcoins for a hostage, so he couldn't be tracked. The rates went to $30 and back to $1. "I thought "wasn't the last time I checked 1 bitcoin $0.10 or $1?" Also, [The founder of the Pirate Party had put all his savings in it.]( I checked some skype interviews on youtube but wasn't convinced. Bitcoin was only used for investment and criminal activities like hostages, drugs and gambling (mainly poker). "Ok the coins cant be copied, but it will definitely be hacked or blocked by the government. Btw, Gavin Andresen spoke to the CIA about it already.
**3) 2012**. 1 bitcoin $10. "Wasn't the last time I checked 1 bitcoin 1$? Whatever." I gained some nice euro's by switching banks and savings accounts really quick to the one with the best interest rates. I'd never invested in my live and really don't put it in something that could hacked or taken down by the CIA or something.
**4) 2013 Cyprus crisis.** Fk...... (T_T). 0 Bitcoins but could explain the basics to people what it is, like the inflation and supply and demand. I was too busy with school anyway. I check it out later.
**5) July 2013**. OOOOOooooohhhhhwww *(lightbulb moment)*. It works like torrents! I understand that! Why didn't I know that earlier!?. Everyone is sharing and downloading the same file. This can't be shut down by the government in the core system. Also, a savings account with a interest rating of 2% is not a good thing when there is an inflation of 3%. Lets test how it works with 0.5 bitcoins at first!
**6) November 2013** Holy shiet! I forgot about it! buybuybuy ┗(T0T)┛.

The dollar will be a (strange) bell-curve too. I saw some graphs in an presentation form Tuur Demeester. He said the black/white tv, color-tv and radio are all technological innovations with an S-curve. If that would be true, everyone should now have a radio, b/w TV **and** a color TV in at there home. This is just not true. The radio went down trough innovation, the B/W TV and soon the dollar too. Bitcoin also eventually. I think by an altcoin in 10 years.

Sorry to be a wet blanket. But, writing a description of Bitcoin for general audiences is bloody hard. There is nothing to relate to. *- Satoshi Nakamoto, July 5, 2010*
I've been thinking how to ELI5 bitcoin. But the best thing is that you try not to relate it to something. Because its just not comparable to something. And btw, Bitcoins aren't stored anywhere and everywhere at the same time. Especially not like a photo or a song. So what you say is completely false.

People should get ready for the next few years, but they also need to stop thinking they'll have access to everyday uses like wifi, phonecalls, internet or even electricity, water, gas or oil products. Most people can't pay their bills or their debts when the inflation inceases that much that 1 bag of rice will be +100 dollars in a short time. I like and believe in bitcoin and have most of my money in it, but i don't think everyone will be able to use it. Dont bet on one horse. And only bet on bitcoin and things like gold and silver if you already have everything else like food, clean water and energy without secondary party.

In fact, the public and private key IS your wallet. More like 1 bank account number. Coinbase, blockchain, mycelium, multibit, bitcoin core and many others are providers and programs that offers you multiple wallets in one place. Just like at your bank, you can have multiple bank account numbers in one account. 1 for private use, 1 for your company, 1 for savings, ect..
To understand bitcoin**s** and the wallets, you need to think the opposite way of what you're used to with your fiat. With fiat, you have a wallet that *contains* some fiat from the monetary economy in your country. With bitcoin, you have a wallet (public key) that is *ATTACHED* to some of the bitcoins in the Bitcoin network. When you trade bitcoins, you don't *send* your bitcoins from 1 address to another, but you *change ownership* of some of the bitcoins in the Bitcoin Network from one address to another. Just see the Bitcoin Network as one big block that contains all the bitcoins in existence.

I dont understand what is blocking the development of bitcoin trade companies in the USA. In my country there are at least 5 different companies selling and even buying bitcoins for fiat (Euro's) directly to the key you want through some paypal like businesses. The time between the click on the 'confirm transaction' button and seeing the bitcoins in my Core wallet is shorter that the loading time between the click on the 'confirm transaction' button and reaching the invoice page.

A phone is not a save place to store your bitcoins. This also applies for digital fiat. I think in the future everyone will use an bitcoin wallet like trezor, [pitbull wallet]( coinkite card or some NFC and BTLE devices. This will replace your fiat wallet or something you can put in your fiat wallet. Some people dont even have an fiat wallet and put all their cards in their phone case.
Or someone will invent a bitcoin (smart)phone. Like 2 separated computers in 1 device that are not connected with each other, but only share hardware like the camera, NFC and usb port.

Thats not true most of the time. People an companies need to pay their bills, supplies, taxes and other stuff in fiat. Especially for companies its nothing more than logic to convert it to fiat right away before the volatility crushes your sales. They wont have to when their suppliers enz also accept bitcoin, but they still dont. But it seems like most bitcoiners dont understand that.

Every war in history only existed because governments had the power to inflate their currency for their own gain. In Greece they mixed copper thought their gold coins to inflate the currency and finance their wars. Wars are just too expansive and there are only 2 options. 1: higher taxes, 2: inflation (taxing future generations). With bitcoin, only option 1 is available. People will never allow this and will overthrow their government from within.
So TLDR: Bitcoin is able to prevent wars.

I understand you want to take it easy with only $50 in BTC, but you're not in control of your private keys. So why not using Blockchain.info for an easy, secure, online walk around wallet? I dont know the differences because I never used coinbase. I use Euro's and like to be in control of my keys, so I dont think coinbase offers something valuable to me. And if you really want walking around money, why not put it on your phone whit encrypted addresses and paper/digital backup?

I'm a store manager and I want to accept bitcoins in my supermarket. If its save, works well, attracts more/new costumers and/or shows a significant saving in the costs, the director wants to implement the format in the other 65 stores too. I heard some problems with Transaction Malleability and/or dubble spending, but i dont understand completely how it works. As far as i understood, you need to w8 10 minutes for the confirmations Otherwise you could get scammed. This is not an option. The cashier must be able to dispatch a costumer with only 1 product in 30 seconds. If a scam happens once, its off the table. If it happens more, i might have a problem.
Is it possible to complete a transaction in 30 seconds with a 0% chance getting scammed afterwards and what are the odds?
I have some ideas how to implement the whole thing and am able to directly change it to euro's, but some extra advice is always welcome.

If nobody wants copper gold coins, it doesn't have value. If nobody wants fiat money, it doesn't have value. Its the same with bitcoin. If nobody wants to use it as a value of exchange, its worthless. They can print their fiat what they want, it doesn't matter when no one want to use it. I understand your point, but you are talking about today. I'm talking about the future and and what bitcoin is capable off. When everybody uses bitcoin and/or a similar crypto currency, warmongers can't create value out of nothing to finance their needs. Also, money laundering would be a thing of the past.

1: use blockchain Merchant app for random QR/public key. To convert it directly to fiat, use the public key from there bitpay (or other company with the same ability) account in the blockchain merchant app settings.
2: Win-Win situation when bitcoin becomes more valuable. When I buy a bitcoin for 400€ and spend it at your university at a 800€ rate. I get 50% off, would probably spend more and it cost your university nothing!

The point is that the banks are loaning out more than they have. With other words, false minting. You cant compare it with a truck because a truck is something real. Just like real gold or silver. But your car papers are something imaginary. just like your dollars in your pocket.
Imagine that you lend your car to your friend and he pays a half percent interest per year as compensation. However, you lend your car only on paper. The car remains in your garage doing nothing. Your friend goes to his nephew and he sells the car to him. The nephew is on paper the owner now, but doesn't possess the real car. However, your friend promises his nephew that he could claim the car at any time he wants. Your friend puts the money he gained from selling your car to his nephew in a savings account which gives him a 2.5% interest rate. Your friend earns now net 2% per year. Out of thin air, without even betting one penny of his own money. There are now two people who think they own the car. You of course, but also your friends nephew. But what if the nephew wants to claims his car? Well, he doesn't. Because he traded the car papers with someone else for a new flat screen television. And that someone else used it to payoff some debts. the car papers are now a medium of exchange, just like the original gold backed dollars, and before that, the prove of ownership papers from the smith who stored the gold in their vaults. Your friend thinks 'Well thats nice!' So he sells the car on paper again to his niece. And again to his brother. And again....

OP of the comment here. I understand what you say and I don't agree with the others that you're downvoted into oblivion, because it is a valid point. So here a upvote. The cam and torrenting is more like a joke, hoping the creators realize they better put it on the internet in exchange for bitcoins.


I also heard Skyfall, the hobbit and Transformers were great pieces worth paying for thanks to advertisements and bribed movie critics. But after watching I felt insulted, dumbed down and had waisted not only 3 hours of my live, but also €15 each because they're pieces of shit. I've never payed for watching pieces of art like Cloud Atlas, V for Vendetta and other movies I liked. But If the creators releases a bitcoin address to donate, I give them at least €30 each.
I think a movie/documentary about something on the internet and as modern as bitcoin, should use more modern ways. Also this documentary expiration date. I think the movie industry need to change like this:
* From: Get interested trough advertisements &gt; If think worth paying for it, pay for it or if think its not that good, pirate it &gt; watch it.
* To: Get interested trough advertisements &gt; watch it through streaming or downloading &gt; pay for it.
Bitcoin can be a great part of it and this will also increase the quality. I think it would also work for Ebooks.

It doesn't matter where it is stored, but where the private key is created. If you create an brainwallet on bitaddress.org, close the webpage, and send the coins to it, the coins are not connected to the internet. But some spyware or something could have watched/recorded you while you created the wallet, so thy still could be stolen. In this case its more like tepid-storage.

Yes it is. 2 bitcoin transactions a week is A LOT!! Especially for a country with one of the best banktransaction posibilities in the world. I spoke with some people who went to the bitcoin boulevard. All of them said it failed, but it was a nice try. It was also a marketing problem because I heard of it for the first time 6 days before the opening, in this subreddit! Also the nightlife of Den Haag is not really a place for tourist or a hotspot for most of the digital/bitcoin generation.

I have posted this several times but never got an answer why miners thinks Ghash is more profitable. Or maybe I'm missing something. 
Lets say GHash has a 40% share in the hashrate distribution and the BTCguild 20%. So GHash have a 2/5th chance of mining the coins and BTCguild 1/5th. If you have one epic mining rig that you provide 10% of the BTCguilds mining power, you'll only provide 5% of the mining power of Ghash if you joined that pool. Your poolshare will also cut in half. In this case you'll get with both pools an average of 0.5BTC/block. 25x10%x20% for BTCguild and 25x5%x40% for Ghash.
You'll get your bitcoins at Ghash faster, but when you mine 24/7 it wouldn't be a big of a deal. you'll only increase the risk that your pool will grow that big that it could mess up the system and make your mined bitcoins worthless. So just like banks, you take a lot of risk that could fuck up the system for quick money. Or is that merged mining really that profitable?
@_date: 2014-06-08 14:28:55
For some altcoin probably not. But I think some (government) hacking group will be right on it when a bitcoin pool gets &gt;50%.

Hey Scott, I really like your bitcoin videos. Unlike most bitcoin videos, your 'under the hood' video hits almost every aspect and goes a littlebit more deeper into explaining all the aspects of bitcoin, that'll leave the viewers with a better understanding and lesser questions than all the others. This new one is great also and I share it when someone ask me for information about bitcoin. Because you want some feedback, here I have some.
The first is not just for your videos, but for all educational videos and/or presentations. Of a 40 minute presentation, a listener will only remember 10 minutes of it because they got bombed with all the new information the brain needs to absorb. Ive learned this when I had to give some collages in classes. To reflect it to your video, I had to watch your 'under the hood' video 3-4 times to absorb all the information. The shorter the video, the better. The longer the video, the less people will remember about it. But because bitcoin is such a big thing, its impossible to make it a 5 minutes full explaining video. In fact the biggest problem with the majority of the bitcoin videos out there, is that they all want to be a short ELI5 video about the whole thing. Resulting in several short bitcoin videos that became nothing more than copies of each other with a different simulation and explained in the end nothing at all. 
My suggestion is to have one overall ELI5 video (In your case this video) and several other short videos, explaining just one little aspect about bitcoin each from ELI5 to a deep technical level. In youtube, you can link videos to each other. "want to know more about public/private keys? klick here", "Understanding what the blockchain is and how it works? click here". This way people can choose what they want to know more about and are able to manage their 10 of 40 minutes to their own needs. I'm gonna us this method with some friends to create short explaining minecraft videos (just for fun). I and a lot of other people get annoyed that they'll have to watch a 15-30 minute video of BS while they only needed 1.5 minutes of information of it explaining how to build that little redstone connection.
I hope this helped a little and I would like to see more from you. Keep up the good work! 100 upvotes from me! Edit: lol changetip fail.. changed 'one hundred'  to 100 upvotes ;)

The blockchain merchant app is more for amateur use or if you think you'll get max 5 BTC transactions a day. If you want to register what is paid in bitcoin, you need to write it down in the description. Or you can write the transaction code from your fiat cash register and note "is paid in bitcoin".  If you get more than 10 transactions a day, I recommend [a Coinkite terminal](

Its because the stability of the financial system based on the dollar is less worse than last year. The minister of finance of the EU says "the crisis is over" and from the USA we hear similar things. After all what they have done, citizens and companies still believe them and people starts to think they dont 'need' Bitcoin. its all an illusion becouse banks and governments have reformed absolutely 0 of the critical points that coused the crisis in 2008. And at 2nd, Bitcoin had the worst PR in history last 4 months. When a new fiat card falls, we're back in crisis and people will seek for bitcoin again to store their value.

Yes. With shares you own a % of a company. When you have 1 satoshi, you own 1/2,099,999,997,690,000 of the Bitcoin. Same with dollars, Euro's ect.. Only with fiat they keep increasing the denominator. So 1 share for $10 in the Bitcoin is $1 billion each bitcoin. Even the best circlejerkers can't imagine about that.

The development of bitcoin is going way faster than the time I (and a many others)  need to gain enough knowledge to build a wallet or exchange. By the time I have enough knowledge I've already been beaten by some computerkiddo who had seen the same hole in the market as I was trying to fill. Sometimes its better to point out the things you like to see than build it yourself, so someone else with the knowledge can build it and make money out of it. In the mean time I'm think about what I can do for bitcoin with my own skills and knowledge. 
Edit: btw, in my country its very easy to buy bitcoins because we have internet money transfer services better than paypal, fast and secure internet banking and the regulations (read lack of restrictions) that made this possible. So you tell OP now to become a politican to change the law, become a banker to build the fiat services and then get the knowledge to start with your bitcoin company.

I have the same feeling with ripple, but Aurora and Spaincoin are completely different. they didn't premined it to enrich themselves. An airdrop is needed to create closed circulation loops asap. And these 2 countries really need something else but fiat. If you could explain why you think the airdrop looks like a scam, it would be nice. When it turns out being a total joke after the airdrop, they go off the radar very quick. At least it would grow some extra awareness about bitcoin and people can test and learn the system without using real money/bitcoin.

This was yesterday at the top of the front page: 
But OK, ontopic: The only question is *"why not accepting bitcoins?"* This question is for every company and especially for websites. 
People want to pay for adult material fast, without revealing any personal information and in a way that nobody will find out when someone checks their payment statements in some way. This is only possible with crypto currencies these days. Bitcoin is the biggest, first and most common of these currencies. Also when you accept bitcoins you'll enter the global market instantly. If I want to pay for your material, I dont have to wait, pay extra fees and convert my euro's for your dollars.
I don't know what kind of adult website you have, but you can block video's or pages until they have paid some bitcoins. I have some seed to spill. I don't want to wait by making an account and send some fiat money through it whit a lot of clicking and typing and shit. I want it fast. Otherwise I move to another website where its free. Just copy/paste the address and send the bitcoins or scan the QR and click on 'send'. **BOOM**, done. Both happy and my seed didn't had the time to pileup onto my brains.
Or you can accept bitcoins by donations like [**VideoLAN**.]( I never did and never could support them through financial donations until thy accepted bitcoins.

If you dont want to create paper wallets, I suggest the Pi-Wallet.
Without connected to a screen, its just printing a paper wallet and you have the option to remember or forget the private key. But connected to a screen, there are a lot of options.
* You can change the number of prints and other settings.
* You can store your public and private keys on a USB and delete the saved ones from your piper wallet.
* You can encrypt your next print in 2 different ways.
* You can customize your bitcoin address (vanity address). I have created my first name in it and imported it in my mycelium wallet on my phone.
* You can electrum offline. Not sure how that works, but its possible.

My parents and friends saying I'm stupid to infest in this "fraudulent magic internet money". When I tell them the amount of €uro's I've invested in it, they sey "WOW you're crazy! So much money!!" But what I didn't tell them, is that the amount I just told them only 10% is of the real number.

I have a question about vanitygen:
I've downloaded it but when i launch it, it directly shuts down. I don't know if I do something wrong or my laptop with windows 8.1 just can't launch it. I can't find others with the same problem.
I used my piper wallet before to create a '1BTtje' address and took 3 hours. I've now one with +2 letters and its seeking for 4 days straight ATM. I think my laptop can find it in at least 20% of the time.

It really depends on where you live. As far as I can read here, coinbase has almost an monopoly in the USA. I live in the Netherlands and here is a huge competition between +5 companies to become the cheapest, fastest and most supportive bitcoin trader. The time between deciding to buy and get the coins in my wallet can be less than 5 minutes. For BTC to EUR its the same thing + an avarage of 3 day, because the banks will hold it for some time.

I mostly lold at, beside the bad acting and opening song, the "Dont instal apps you dont need. Didn't you learn that from TV?" quote.
* She checks her balance constantly. I cant even remember what the last time was I checked.
* Remote access to her computer to check the balance?
* 2 bitcoins worth $5000!!! probably bad translated
* There are 0 transactions made in the phone app
* The guy in the bar know they're directly send to colombia
* The advice to call the police for the stolen bitcoins.

This happened to me the exact same way. The first transaction with bitonic was blocked and got a call 5 minutes after it. I only had to confirm I was buying some bitcoin and they unblocked it. Never had a problem with it after it.
But I really think they need to give a better explanation right afte they block someone.

Well, what you're saying is: "I have some awesome bitcoins and i want to get rid of is ASAP. Will you take it?", to someone who is mis/uninformed and thinks its only used by criminals for illegal activities. After that, the only benefit you say is "its not illegal and you can convert it into dollars." All she thinks is "Why not accepting the (legal) dollars directly and avoid money laundering?"
What you (and i know a lot of other people) are doing is just the wrong way. At a nice moment in a conversation you could say, "Accepting bitcoin could be a huge benefit becouse [an example], **but you won't get them from me!** Also, the one who can decide to accept bitcoins is probably someone from the finance department and/or markteing, not the one who is standing in the store volunteering.

Well, bitcoiners likes to make things complicated.  Just like the differences in Bitcoin, bitcoin and bitcoins. An paper or brainwallet have only 1 public and private key and can be created at multiple services.  Just like your fiat wallet in your pocket. Mycelium, coinbase, ect.. and also the Piper wallet are more like wallet **providers/services** that are able to *create* multiple wallets/addresses/keys/whatever you call it. We also call phone wallets all wallets available on phones and online wallets all wallets you have access with through the internet. In the context OP was asking, calling the public+private key combination the wallet is the easiest way to understand it in my eyes.
Also most people means with bitcoin address only the public key. Your bitcoin address/public key is more like the address of your house that is open to the public, but you need your private key to open the door.

Start with 'what is bitcoin' and why its better than fiat currency's for 2 min.
Then explaining how it works with the public and private key and what the miners are doing. for 1 minute
At last tell them where bitcoin is heading and the alternative uses of the protocol. "Calling bitcoin a currency is like calling the Internet a fancy telephone." - andreas antonopoulos

When the amount of transactions increases it will. At that point bitcoin needs an update to increase the limit or (better) make the amount of transactiondata lower if possible. Otherwise only the top minerfee spenders will be mined, so the small transactions stay out or will be too expensive to send.

The dollar is not a bank too.
mortgages, loans and insurances can also be done in bitcoin. Someone just need to start a company who can provide it. Bitcoin is only not big and enough ***yet*** to make it profitable. BTW, I see bitcoin as an insurance against inflation.

Plus500 does something alike. But it doesn't influence the price on other exchanges like with paper gold. Its just betting you money on bitcoin and when it rises of fall, you can payout in fiat. But you'll never get the real bitcoins because (probably) they just don't have them.

[You can split the private key with the entropy to several papers.]( Also with the entropy you can create multiple wallets, so you wont have to store them all in one place like with trezor. My only questions is if the wallet generation is really random.

In the Netherlands you have to explain when you suddenly drive in an expensive car, live in a big house or suddenly can pay your bills without an bank involved. If you can't or can and it involves 'illegal' activities, good time in jail. I know a lot of Thai people in my country who send money to there poor family. Some did it with bitcoins first because its much cheaper but stopped after the announcement from the national bank.

You're right.  And the sign even say "visit us 24/7 at rbs.co.uk". A almost fully digitalized bank with 24/7 access is almost the same as an exchange or even a bitcoin wallet in term of usability.

I don't get it why everyone thinks Ghash is more profitable.
Lets say GHash has a 40% share in the hashrate distribution and the BTCguild 20%. If you have one epic mining rig that you provide 10% of the BTCguilds mining power, you'll only provide 5% of the mining power of Ghash if you joined that pool. Your poolshare will also cut in half. In this case you'll get with both pools an average of 0.5BTC/block. 25x10%x20% for BTCguild and 25x5%x40% for Ghash.
You'll get your bitcoins at Ghash faster, but when you mine 24/7 it wouldn't be a big of a deal. you'll only increase the risk that your pool will grow that big that it could mess up the system and make your mined bitcoins worthless. So just like banks, you take a lot of risk that could fuck up the system for quick money. Or is that merged mining really that profitable?
