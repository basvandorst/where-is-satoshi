Do you have any idea about web development?

I think the day the bitcoin network came alive (self aware like terminator), but I don't know which day it was, any clue? 
The whitewater only represents the end of him working on his idea, an idea that had been going on for a while not only in his head but of many other people that wanted something like this done and that had been writing about it for many years.

Ok let me try to build something, I think I have found a great free place. It will be interactive and open to all. But it will take some time, I'll keep you posted as soon as I have something, but it won't be until a week or two I guess.

No, really, just try to install the latest version of lubuntu or xubuntu, they require lower specs than Ubuntu or kubuntu. Easier.

I think that one would be the best, I it looks like the most representative to me compared to the others.  Also it is a good date to give away prizes, I'll take a look at my calendar... yep I'm free (I imagine myself giving away prices in a cheap videoconference-ceremony instead of the queen of Sweden, she would not be invited,  brb I need an tuxedo suit to feel important)
Maybe we should create a simple web to promote this idea. Any suggestions where to host the web for free?

So let's do it ;) people will latter join in for sure. Help me search the day it all started, or propose something

Of course,  and don't worry,  this kind of thing must be democratic, not like the Nobel or MTV awards ;)
