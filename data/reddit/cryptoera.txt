Anonymity/privacy must happen at the individual node.  Coinjoin, Coinswap, et al, seem to require some form of centralization unless they are built right into the bitcoin protocol.

Bitcoin has some problems:
Poor fungibility due to poor anonymity/privacy.  Translation:  Alternative coins that provide this service at the node, will succeed here where bitcoin does not.
Hard fork drama:  Alternative coins that can readily adapt to what individual users want (requiring hard forks) will also continue to gain popularity at the expense of bitcoin. 
Large data requirement:  Although this isn't specific to bitcoin, this effect seems to naturally reduce distribution, with full nodes dropping off at what seems like a consistent and linear rate.  Unless there is some breakthrough in data compression, the cryptocurrency user may find in the years to come, it may be possible for governments to identify full nodes and take them down through coordinated multi-governmental effort.
Protocol structure:  A lot of people talk about building things on top of bitcoin.  This is ok, but I think all major and worthwhile innovations need to be pushed to the individual node, probably requiring some hard forks, etc.  Already we are seeing alternative services that are being introduced in which the cryptocurrency user must pay to use.  (like privacy/anonymity services).  This in turns causes the cost of ownership to increase and introduces more risk to the user.
Misunderstandings about what the bitcoin network is, versus how to implement changes into bitcoin:  Some people seem to think the development needs distributed...whatever that means.  No, for bitcoin to continue to be useful, developers need to work as a team.  In light of recent events, obviously easier said than done.
Where do I see it in three years?  I see it stagnating.

Accepting cryptocurrencies is great, but make sure you are in it for the long haul.  This isn't a get rich quick type of situation due to the low financial inroads bitcoin has made so far.

Generate your own random private key.  
+ Casino grade dice (5) (easier than rolling 1 die 99 times) ([Casino Grade Dice!](
* Offline 
* An important part of creating a Bitcoin wallet is ensuring the random numbers used to create the wallet are truly random. Physical randomness is better than computer generated pseudo-randomness. The easiest way to generate physical randomness is with dice. To create a Bitcoin private key you only need one six sided die which you roll 99 times. Stopping each time to record the value of the die. When recording the values follow these rules: 1=1, 2=2, 3=3, 4=4, 5=5, 6=0. By doing this you are recording the big random number, your private key, in B6 or base 6 format. You can then enter the 99 character base 6 private key into the text field above and click View Details. You will then see the Bitcoin address associated with your private key. You should also make note of your private key in WIF format since it is more widely used. Credit:  
* To record this generated private key:   or something similar.  
* For what its worth, I dropped my dice individually into a glass container with a narrow top to prevent the dice from bouncing out.  Dropping the dice into this caused the die to bounce around real good to get some good entropy.

Let me tell you what is happening:  There is a lot of bitcoin being held.  It is being held, because if large chunks of these bitcoins were sold, the price would seriously drop.  Therefore, large bitcoin holders are only selling bitcoin at about the same rate that fiat is going into bitcoin.  Don't let this current price range fool you.
A healthy bitcoin price is one that is going up.  Not stagnating in a certain price range.

Always run a wallet locally like Bitcoin Core, Armory, etc.
Always store the bulk of your bitcoin offline.  (i.e. the machine is NEVER online.  NEVER.)

Learn about two factor authentication.  Learn about

He isn't afraid. My take is that he doesn't give a shit one way or the other.  However, lets establish some things:   he works for a tech publication.

Combine both of these points together and its obvious this is how he gets his shits and giggles (attention or a feeling of importance).  He's a classic troll, except he gets paid for it.

Bitcoin has gone from $1200 to ~$350.  Its already begun a type of collapse. Less and less people who would have considered exchanging fiat for bitcoin are saying hell no.  We have found out that it isnt very privacy centric, it is getting more centralized day by day.  It was a good experiment, but I think its day is done.  It is too hard to work with if you want privacy and decentralization.  Bitcoin development is stagnant.  It will die, maybe not quick, but it is dying.

Its just not enforceable, that is the problem they have to deal with now. But if it should come to that, what we should require, is that all government employees (instead of the public) who use bitcoin in a government setting, need to register their identity with each private key they use.  i.e. FBI confiscated bitcoin, etc.  Or if it is mulitsig, then all person's identities that control the funds, need to register their identity, unless it can be proven they may come to harm by doing so.

The coinbase is the content of the 'input' of a generation transaction. While regular transactions use the 'inputs' section to refer to their parent transaction outputs, a generation transaction has no parent, and creates new coins from nothing.
The coinbase can contain any arbitrary data. The genesis block famously contains the dated title of an FT article:
The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks
This is probably intended as proof that no bitcoins existed before 2009.
@_date: 2014-12-15 08:32:03
Yes, perhaps so.  The only way around it is to register the private key with the IRS I suppose, or some other third party.  Not something I would do or advocate. :-)  Which begs the question and is kind of off topic, but how would the IRS prove you owned a certain amount of coins?

Having owned both, I believe bitcoin or cryptocurrencies in general (in the context of storing value), are vastly superior to any naturally occurring resource, other than human beings of course.  These are just some advantages over any resource, not just gold.
* We know exactly how many bitcoins there are in total.
* You can 100% lock down or otherwise control your funds.

* Background checks of all business owner(s).
* Brick and Mortar offices of member businesses would be great.
* A "one strike and your out" policy.
* Clear bylaws governing bitcoin foundation member business behavior.
* Engender a "treat others as you would have them treat you" culture.
* Hold member businesses to a very high and extreme code of business ethics.
* Remove people/businesses with conflicts of interest
* Hire or ask for volunteers to make up a team that can perform background checks, interviews, etc. A business ethics strikeforce. :-)

* One of the more important points I think people are missing is that it is 100% controllable by the individual owner.  i.e. you alone control who has access to the funds.  The ability to easily confiscate your property (in this case, a store of value) is nullified by the use of cryptocurrencies.  
* Another point is that for the first time in history, if you haven't made prior arrangements, your wealth dies when you do.

A lot of scummy people involved in the bitcoin foundation unfortunately, either directly or indirectly.  Im not sure it was Gavin's vision to have some of these swizzle sticks involved at the bitcoin foundation.
As far as the foundation goes, we will see if they can shut down Bitlicense completely or not.  If not, I don't really see it as much use since this kind of stuff will be ongoing.
One other thing I would like to add:  I hope they are also prepared or thinking about taking this kind of challenge to bitcoin to the Supreme Court if necessary.

Edited:  Yeah, thanks for clarifying that buttonpincher.  I misunderstood that as well.  Still...  My problem is I'm afraid of this guy masquerading as somebody doing this out of the goodness of his heart, and skimming a significant portion of the donations for his own personal use.  Although I have no problem with the people involved using donations for living.  Rent, food, etc.  Its quite easy to give this information (the finances) to the public, especially with the blockchain being what it is.  I am quite leery of "bitcoin charities" who aren't transparent. 
He may also think he is doing something great for the homeless...so he "rewards" himself with some of the donations.  Human psychology can be quite complex.  Bottom line is there doesn't appear to be any oversight so he can do whatever the fuck he wants. 
Blockchain technology is perfect for charities btw.  Honest charities.  They can publish all the addresses they use, label them, and anybody can look at them and evaluate if they want to donate or not.  Blockchain tech is perfect for transparency.  Charities would be wise to use this feature.
@_date: 2014-09-15 03:10:08

There is danger in consensus unfortunately.  Simply because everybody upgrades or does not upgrade doesn't mean that they have chosen correctly.  Its possible that the developers aren't even working on what really should be done software-wise.  It may not even be on their radar.  It is highly possible that consensus = failure.

Cryptocurrencies are the ultimate asset (as far as a store of value).  Why?
  You and only you, can grant access to only yourself, multiple entities, etc.  No one and no entity has access unless specifically granted.  (as an aside, ignorance or not properly securing your cryptocurrency is a form of granted access).
 It is trivial to move it around.
 It is trivial to trade it for goods and services.

It's good to have regulation as far as people who engage in actual criminal actions.  There needs to be repercussions for these types of people.  On the other hand, cryptocurrencies are going to be notoriously difficult, if not impossible, to regulate.  After all, I can create a "bank account" (private key, public key) instantly and can create multiple bank accounts quickly.  Managing these bank accounts is also trivial.  The only way to regulate cryptocurrencies is have everybody voluntarily link their identity to each and every bank account they create.  Also, with the advent of stealth addresses (thank you Peter Todd) and other privacy enhancing ideas, registering your identity with each and every address is simply not going to happen.

Bitcoin has been out of beta for years basically.  The core devs + other contributors, haven't added much of any import for a long time.  (much to our chagrin).  Anonymity incorporated into the core protocol should have been a goal with a hard fork early on.  Instead, they have rested on their laurels w/infighting.  Maybe in a few years time, something better will be taken up by the cryptocurrency masses.
Unwise to put money into something in which early adopters could care less, because they have already converted a significant portion of the btc holdings to USD.  (what does this tell you?)
Altcoins now show more promise than bitcoin actually.  
I think we will get there, but people are the weak link at the moment.

Until they require people to associate their identity with each private key in a governmental database, it doesn't matter.  (and even then, they cannot force people to tie their identities to each private key they create.  btw, each private key is akin to a bank acccount)  Like I've said elsewhere, it is trivial to move large amounts of value in the crypto world now.  You could actually move large sums of money dynamically, i.e. move n amount of money every T hours according to whatever script you have set up.  This way, the money is always on the move, far out of reach of any entity. (governmental or otherwise). We are entering an age of crypto assets, and I think the government is powerless to stop it.  If they want to stop money laundering, terrorism, they will have to use some other forensic method than just following a money trail. (in other words, they will have to actually work.)

If you have contributed to a Roth IRA, then I think you can withdraw all of it without penalty if it has been 5 years since your first contribution to the Roth.  You have already paid taxes on it.
On the traditional 401(k) side, you may be able to take a loan against it, but that doesnt help you much.

The best way of storing (cold wallet) your cryptocurrency is using non-digital methods.   Paper wallets, vinyl (as in a record), engraving private key (QR code) onto durable material, etc.  I think it is almost safe to say that if the information  is digital..it can be hacked or easily stolen.  I also would like to mention you can present a private key in such a way as to need a microscope or something similar to read it.  If you put the private key in this format, you can pretty much hide it in plain "sight".

If that is the case, then the idea is fundamentally broken.  There should only be 1 cryptocurrency token corresponding to 1 USD.  If it isn't, then, like I said, something shady or strange is going on.  At the very least, it is a kind of false advertising.
As far as I know, 1 tether token corresponds to 1 USD.  And each tether token is only issued if it is backed by 1 USD.  
If this isn't the case, then it is useless to use these "pegged" cryptos.
Here is a quote from the Tether website:  "Every tether is always backed 1-to-1, by traditional currency held in our reserves. So 1 USD₮ is always equivalent to 1 USD."

It proves that my cryptocurrency can be transferred out of a trading account whenever the fuck I want.  Do I care about other's accounts in this context?  Not really.  See the big picture here:  If I have $1,000,000 in btc in an external trading account, and can close all my positions very quickly, and also transfer the btc to an account I exclusively control almost instantaneously, that is good for me.  This is all that is needed to verify solvency....movement of funds at any time at the customer's discretion.  All people really need to worry about is their own account's solvency.

You are not doing anything wrong.  But you will not get wealthy by accepting bitcoin physically at  a kiosk....not until 1 out of 5 people have bitcoin wallets on their smartphones.

@_date: 2015-07-23 13:19:39
Honestly, I think that currently, it is going to be the other way around.  Since bitcoin has massive network effect, it is the payment system that negotiates the actual payment.  Other, better cryptocurrencies will use this bitcoin payment network through services such as xmr.to and shapeshift.io.  
In the future it is possible that an alternative cryptocurrency will eclipse bitcoin, thus becoming the payment network, but that may take a very long time.

Appreciate your response.  I am not really a fan of building "on top" of a cryptocurrency.

I would say that what needs to be done is this:  When a business owner puts their business on coinmap, coinmap emails the business owner maybe 4 times per year, or maybe twice per year, and asks if the owner still wants it listed.  If the owner replies yes (or no), great.  If the owner never replies then it is automatically removed.  This should have been set up from the beginning.
@_date: 2015-04-05 11:20:57
People don't know how to separate the decentralization idea from bitcoin itself.  The work that goes into bitcoin can be centralized, there is nothing wrong with that.  Nor is there anything wrong with people working as teams (centralization) to get the job done.  Decentralization is merely mitigation of risk. It is a necessary and valuable idea re: cryptocurrencies and running the software itself.
Applying the idea of decentralization to cryptocurrency culture is a non-sequitur.

@_date: 2015-04-30 12:09:09
People don't understand the decentralization concept.  On one hand, technically, it is fine for bitcoin to work in a decentralized manner.  This is what we want, in order to mitigate failures.
On the other hand, people get pissed because more people are not adopting bitcoin.  In other words, all the greedy bastards out there (me included) want cryptocurrencies to go mainstream.  This can be called centralization of thinking right?  We want people to say, "yes", I want to use bitcoin (cryptocurrencies).  This is the social aspect of cryptocurrencies, where centralization = success.
The bitcoin foundation is a social construct...it has nothing to do with the technical operation of bitcoin itself.  We do need high quality and ethical organizations to interface with governments both local and federal.
So, to say we dont need these organizations is simply wrong.  And in the long run, they are key to social acceptance.

You are forgetting that it is highly likely that other DEA agents, FBI agents, etc etc, probably have done this in the past with fiat money.  They just haven't been caught because fiat is sometimes difficult to trace.  I doubt this is an isolated and rare instance.

Another wake up call to the core devs to concentrate on privacy enhancing technology such as Cryptonote.  I think this pretty much put the nail in the coffin for me as far as using bitcoin.  It should be a human right to be free to transact at a 100% anonymous level.

That would mean obtaining your coins with cash in a no questions asked exchange.  All other exchanges are traceable.  We now know that bitcoin transactions seem to be fairly transparent given the right equipment and knowledge.  Another reason we need truly anonymous/private transactions.
@_date: 2015-03-26 19:26:36
Yeah, this AML/KYC crap has got to be the biggest fucking joke for these exchanges to try and comply with.  All of the American bitcoin exchanges have really poor communication.

At some point they will introduce a fee I guess.  I haven't checked on that for a while now.  I've kind of just set it and forget it.  If the fee is too ridiculous, I will just stop the service (via changing the percentage to zero on my end).

Greg Maxwell has been the only core dev I know of who has actually thought about this and offered solutions.  The other core devs, Gavin Andresen most importantly, don't seem to think these are issues.  Instead, Gavin is worried about block size, Jeff Garzik is concerning himself with putting sats in orbit.  I would rather these privacy issues get ironed out first.  Maybe incorporate Cryptonote tech.  
Also, it is possible that most of the core devs think it is just fine for transactions to be traced and IP's associated with identity for the purposes of law enforcement.  Bad state of affairs actually.

This aids in using bitcoin easily in a fiat world.  To me this is a step forward, not two steps back.
The only question I really have  is does bitpay or the banking underwriter of the debit card use the deposits to the card as slush fund for investments or to trade bitcoin itself?

I no longer even have that option on my account.  They removed it.  Earlier last week they wanted to know exactly how I was using my money or some bullshit.

Paper wallets as cold storage are a hassle.  Trust me, get a Trezor or Ledger.  Also, you can't just run the software, aka bitcoin core, on your PC. (unless you are running  a node)  There is just too much malware, etc out there.  Hardware wallets are where its at.

@_date: 2015-02-03 00:16:53
In all seriousness, I think women will come on board to bitcoin as they see fit.  They may be a little intimidated, but I am not really sure why.  I read a little bit @ bitcoinwoman.com about the rower who wanted to row from CA to Hawaii and was sponsored by Ultracoin (which was coded by a woman).  Its not that women are less intelligent than men, its just that women's interests aren't the same as men's.  This isn't a bitcoin problem, its a divergent interest problem; and this has been going on for eons.  I'm of the opinion that women can do whatever the fuck they want, and this includes contributing to the bitcoin community in their own way.  (and believe me, the cryptocurrency community does need this, because women have a very different perspective sometimes, which is healthy.)
@_date: 2016-05-12 04:28:06
Yeah, but then getting the actual USD into your bank account may be quite problematic with coinbase.  How many hoops would he have to jump through to do that?  Unfortunatley, by using coinbase, your funds may be locked up for weeks, and if things really go south, years.

 Exchanging fiat for bitcoin without any government entity being aware of this.
 Exchanging fiat for bitcoin, or cryptocurrency to cryptocurrency that is 100% secure for the customer.
 Bitcoin not being entirely anonymous.  We need wide adoption of a cryptocurrency that is 100% private between two parties.
 Exchanging fiat for bitcoin, and the resultant transaction trail being 100% obfuscated to third parties.
 Wallets that track volatility. i.e. What point you exchange fiat for bitcoin resulting in a total of how much bitcoin you can spend (or not spend) in relation to average fiat&lt;&gt;bitcoin conversion rate.
 Credit card size Trezor type devices that allow you to secure your bitcoin even if law enforcement gets a hold of the device.  Mitigate or eliminate the ability of law enforcement to act upon civil forfeiture and mitigate thieves being able to obtain your cryptocurrency.
 Tax avoidance strategies to significantly reduce paying taxes to tax collecting authorities. i.e. software solutions that are no brainers incorporated right into cryptocurrency wallets.
