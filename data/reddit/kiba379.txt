We need more stores in the uk to accept bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-09-25 15:23:28
Ahh okay, i have 34 conformations on one though and sill havn't received the btc
@_date: 2013-09-03 12:47:36
So would i be best to store the majority of my bitcoins on one on my pc and transfer the ones to an online wallet i want to spend that week?
@_date: 2013-09-25 14:58:11
Could you please check that out and tell me if its taking a while im not too up on the conformations
@_date: 2013-09-03 12:52:06
This could be really useful, what android wallet would you recommend?
@_date: 2013-11-22 12:54:03
Okay im looking to be a buyer of the merchandise so can you keep me updated?
@_date: 2013-09-03 22:15:17
Thanks alot man. just worked out how to transfer it took me about 10 mins
@_date: 2013-09-03 12:06:48
Thanks, ill check these out on my dinner.
@_date: 2013-11-22 13:35:01
from the link. maybe its because im using chrome?
@_date: 2013-09-25 15:27:03
Not sure where it was sent from just bought it from ebay. But im using coinbase.
@_date: 2013-09-25 15:03:18
Also how many Verifications does a transaction need?
@_date: 2013-11-22 13:25:31
I need to request permission to view the file
@_date: 2013-11-22 12:49:03
would this also be open to the UK?
@_date: 2013-09-25 15:27:31
Ahh okay sounds like it could be that then one has over ten and the other is 34 so i think you could be right.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:20:52
ill take 0.3 please ;)
@_date: 2013-09-03 12:22:57
Do you recommend having a wallet online with coinbase or downloading one? or even both? if so witch is the safest wallet to download?
@_date: 2013-09-25 16:23:29
So this is a problem at coinbases end?
@_date: 2013-09-03 12:53:32
Ahh okay then so the only benefit is that nobody can get access to my coins unless there at my pc?
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:25:13
I have the same problem
@_date: 2013-09-25 15:01:15
