Your right about which gov and if it was before marriage.  I assumed US which I can see now is a narrow and naive assumption.  If in US and property was before marriage ,  it would be negotiated during mediation in a divorce.  Usually the outcome is keep what it was worth before marriage date and 1/2 each for “value” .  But if he leaves it in BTC it would be interesting.  Is it worth 300BTC? Meaning  that hasent changed or is it worth $ value?  Will need to see case law on this.  Will be interesting in the next few years how this is handled.   But if he plans to stay married for now and access $ for BTC , Might as well tell her .  Won’t change how it’s considered during divorce proceedings .

Of course tell your wife.  Gov says bitcoin is property .  So yours is hers...Don’t mess around with hiding any .  It will haunt you and make you feel paranoid.  Besides, even 150 BTC will keep you fat and happy forever.  If she knows nothing about BTC take her to a fancy restaurant have a great dinner and tell her you have good news that is life changing. show her a balance statement from coinigy or something like that.   Tell her your plans with it.  Mine is to withdraw 1% of balance per month or max withdrawal of 12k that is just over 10k after taxes per month since you have held them more than 1 year.  Think about that.  10k cash every month to do what ever you want .open a business and do a job you really like.  Even if you break even, you will be having fun working when you want and playing when you want.  In 10 years you will most likely have over 10 mil in BTC , a business you can sell,  kids with college paid for , still married and a shit ton of sky miles from traveling 1st class seeing the world with someone you care about.  Whatever you do do just withdraw it and put it in a bank!!
