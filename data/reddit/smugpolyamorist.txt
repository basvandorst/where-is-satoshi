Bitcoin's killer app is finally apparent.

A much more realistic target is getting .bit support into the Tor browser package. It's very synergistic with Tor, which currently uses random strings for .onion site names.

This was probably a better way of trying to save money than attempting to blackmail a presidential candidate.

You bought something that wasn't drugs? You're doing it wrong.

On the contrary, it's almost the only real business being done with bitcoin. All the rest is speculation or hobbyist / advocacy stuff.

Are you sure it's not hash?

If Bitcoin completely replaced the US dollar (M2 dollar supply = $10tn) it would have a value equivalent to $500k 2013 dollars. I wouldn't argue this is likely, but nor is it impossible.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:51:20
I bet you 1 bitcoin it isn't.
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:56:55
Yes, definitely what Bitcoin needs right now is derivatives. Collateralized debt obligations never hurt anyone.
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:50:50
Nope. 2 Pizzas for 10,000 BTC, or $2.2m at current rates.

You pay 40% income tax on $13ph wtf?
@_date: 2013-04-01 08:59:22
Yep, 4:22 just made me think [citation needed]

Anyone with the wherewithal to code this would probably know better.

The difference back then was that the government could ban gold, and effectively enforce it.
Now we have Bitcoin.

Halves in the UK are 10oz, which makes them almost the size as US beer bottles.

They're all potentially at risk though. If only there were [domains invulnerable to government meddling...](

Multiple passes are woo-woo even on modern magnetic storage, let alone flash.
@_date: 2013-07-12 00:25:20
The irony is that Bitcoin will make it harder to collect corporation and income taxes.

One of those times where the m/M distinction really matters.

I love bringing it up with again with people, and saying things like "if you'd listened to me you'd've made at least £20,000".

You clearly missed the 10% flash crash this morning when he sold then.

People will keep on buying ASICs until the difficulty's gone so high they're no longer profitable.

Meanwhile, at our hedge fund...

You can only short things people will lend you. It's not a god given right, and theres not unlimited depth.

This isn't really a hedge fund, it's closer to an ETF.

For you non financiers; he's upside-down on this trade by about $135,000.

I remember when it was about a thousand times lower...

What a silly criticism.
This is the same as any raffle, the chance of winning is proportional to the number of tickets bought, with an EV of 0.981.
Your proposed change would have no effect, as a large better could just split their bet into the small pool from several addresses.

I know two people with that sort of experience: both are earning about $1000 a day consulting. Are you able to pay that much?
@_date: 2013-06-03 06:27:35
Me and one of our quants did a back of the envelope calculation like this a while back. We came up with a range of $5-$1MM.
@_date: 2013-08-24 21:58:33
400% down isn't badly phrased, it's simply wrong.
