Bit the bullet back in 2013. Pre-ordered a 25 gh/s Butterfly Labs ASIC machine in April of that year. That bastard didn't arrive until November. 
So as you can imagine, but the time it arrived it had less than a month of profitability left in it. 
Needless to say my losing bitcoin virginity wasn't a pleasant experience. But now there are various different options for purchasing bitcoin, besides mining. I'm glad I wasn't discouraged from the bitcoin community entirely because the community is great and the potential the blockchain has on emerging technologies is definitely something to be proud of. Even if I only helped maintain it for a couple months. 
Long live Bitcoin!

I feel like I have found more than one and yet it seems I have found nothing. I'm about to just post all the clues I've found for everyone.
@_date: 2014-08-02 15:13:36
Grazie! lol and thats at least an up vote for trying :)

Being that it is Italy's first BTC ATM, I couldn't agree more. Privacy is quickly becoming a thing of the past. From what I hear Italians that are "into" bitcoin, are doing it because of the privacy it allows and because the government/politicians can fuck with it...yet. So hopefully the trend will continue to grow as more and more people realize Bitcoin is the      
( as anonymous as you feel necessary ) currency of the future. I wish I could give you two up votes !

It was an absolute pleasure meeting your brother and talking with you on the phone. I look forward to my next purchase of BTC from your GORGEOUS Lamassu ATM. Not to mention the wine ;) Also I could not be happier to help spread the word about Italia's First BTC ATM in Udine. I'm happy to say that our picture with the Lamassu has been viewed over 8,000 times on imgur.com within the first 22 hours of being posted.

P.S. I up voted your comment, childish as it may be. We got a laugh out of it !

I agree it was a flawless execution ! I could not be happier. Might I add good eye on the Lamassu. It was a little blurry and towards the bottom of the photo. It was so easy. It would be smart to buy one.
