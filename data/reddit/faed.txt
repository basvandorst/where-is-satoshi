Aaand 12700. Let's see where we go from here.
Update: lol
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:25:00
Make that $900k.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:00:49
What currency converter are you talking about? There's no such thing as a BTC-&gt;ADA converter. You acquire ADA by trading someone your BTC for their ADA, usually over an exchange.
Again if you didn't understand this you shouldn't have been investing.

It's testing support at the 100 day moving average right now at around 10.6k. It could hold here, or it could break to the 200 day and settle at around 7-8k but I'm optimistic either way.
When it hasn't found support at the 50 day or 100 day in the past, the 200 day has always held.
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:58:31
I dress it up in some bullshit wording and you think it's technical analysis?
Watch the line.
Is it above the line?
Is it below the line?
Oh no.
Watch the line below.
Round numbers are sticky.
A fucking toddler could do this. It's not a fucking coincidence that these lines are historically sticky. Think what you want though, no skin off my back.
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:20:26
He's being realistic. Most projections predict a correction to below $10k, from the resistance we're seeing, maybe even further. Considering the massive run up we had, it's quite likely we'll see something similar in the opposite direction.
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:51:33
We can do that already on binance.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:45:17
Dumb money.
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:15:15
Yeah like here in the UK when our savings dropped 20% in value overnight after the fucking EU referendum. That shit didn't bounce back like bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:39:55
Funny, that's what some people were saying $3k ago. They're awfully quiet now.
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:36:10
Somebody's got to, might as well be this guy.
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:13:53


That's around 90% of everyone here.
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:10:07
Cause he didn't buy altcoins.
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:52:46
What fees?
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:12:06
Yeah at 2pm this Sunday it'll be back at 20k just hodl fam ain't no thang
@_date: 2018-01-11 10:26:11
Lol I'm gonna check back on this comment in 3 days time.
@_date: 2018-01-11 10:22:57
It depends if it closes today out where it is right now. If so then I can see it going to 10 or 11k over the next few days.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:33:32
You haven't lost money until you sell.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:28:53
You're a fucking idiot. Go piss your money away.
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:22:55
It's doing this because it fucking needed to. The growth in the last 6 weeks was completely unsustainable and anyone in this for the long haul is happy about this correction. It's healthy for the market.
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:01:49
Bear market.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:13:35
Well I mean, you're not wrong. But how else do you propose people buy bitcoin and still have it retain it's value?
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:28:03
Lol, I'm not touching it for at least a week.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:55:05
Yeah, and if you're cashing out now then you definitely haven't made any money.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:26:40
Lol, why is this good? Transactions were high because usage was high. High usage = high demand = sustaining price levels.
Guess what happens when usage goes down.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:16:32
It's the bubble bursting, quick you better sell it all to me.
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:18:28
You're a fucking idiot. I feel it's important that you know this and do some good ol' fashioned learning so that you might not be a fucking idiot in future.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:13:20


Where do you think you are?
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:57:28
Well that's they're fault for buying at ATH.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:41:38


Lol try 6.
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:07:35
Yes that's exactly why. It's shocking how many people in this thread haven't read the white paper.
@_date: 2018-01-05 08:19:01
You're pretty much right though. It's been hovering around 15k for the past couple days since it's breakout from 13k.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:53:59
Lol, why wouldn't you buy the dip? Don't you care about money?
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:18:25
Fuck I hope it does. I like my bitcoin like I like my women: cheap with a guaranteed return.
@_date: 2018-01-01 03:15:21
I've no kinder way of putting this: eat a dick.
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:50:22


@_date: 2018-01-21 21:33:03
There'd also be no price movement, e.g. a dead market.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:03:24
USD valuations for basically every coin has to go through bitcoin. The price in satoshi's can stay constant and the relative dollar value will still sink regardless because it's tied to bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:18:21
Cause I'm not the idiot asking other people what to invest in.
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:59:29
We're all at, a loss of, words.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:15:49
That was literally the best chance people are gonna have to buy. Hope ya'll locked some in.
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:11:45
FUD at it's finest ladies and gents. And from a 0 day old account no less.
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:37:51
No it makes me want to open an exchange.
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:40:51
Totally agree. A guy I know voted for it and the morning after was like, "Shit, I didn't think it'd actually happen". Fucking idiot didn't consider there would be consequences to his actions.
It's why I don't want to trust other people with important things like our futures and finances.
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:30:24
Shoulda' registered sooner.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:38:38
I suggest you go do some research into cryptocurrencies and their fundamental differences before sending thousands of dollars worth again.
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:54:07
Agreed, it's been gathering support to break 15 since the big dip.
@_date: 2018-01-05 08:23:56
It's common for markets to stick to round numbers. See; the resistance at 19k, pullback to 10k, support at 13 and 15k.
@_date: 2018-01-03 03:27:48
Literally Google this. It's already been answered half a dozen times.
@_date: 2018-01-14 22:26:34
No, what you mean to say is it consistently precedes an even bigger drop and then a bull run.
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:34:02
We're going to the moon boyo, strap in. No time for FOMO now.
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:30:08
These are the FOMO that bought at an ATH in the last few weeks. If they would zoom out just a few weeks they would see that it's actually up a ridiculous 40% from where it started this month.
That's huge no matter what you measure it against and people that have lost money have only themselves to blame.
@_date: 2018-05-06 01:15:10
\&gt; Bitcoin is so sound
Besides the $30 transaction fees when adopters actually tried to use it, besides some of the longest transaction times of all cryptos, besides the 70&amp; drop in 3 months, besides the virtually barren development future with all its eggs in one basket.
Bitcoin is the main trading coin until there's a new market leader. With both ETH and BCH being in major bull runs and BTC stuck in sidewaysland/bear market it can only be so long before it's overtaken and exchanges start favouring other trading pairs.
@_date: 2018-06-14 20:45:52
Flawed logic. Mainstreet and retail traders have no power over market moves.
Trying to lay blame on someone for something you don't understand doesn't help anything. Play the game better.
@_date: 2019-12-14 22:28:58
How about the fundamental technology being crippled.
@_date: 2018-03-31 23:14:20
All exchanges do some wash trading, but bitfinex is actually one of the more reasonable ones for it. 
If you think they're bad, have a look at Okex.
@_date: 2018-03-31 23:15:57
Dude that's not even $1000, who cares?
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:33:00
But neither of you are right yet. Bitcoin hasn't gone to $0, is that your victory?
@_date: 2018-03-31 23:11:02


Lol, someone got liquidated.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:55:49
Lol yeah, it's the market that's wrong not you.
@_date: 2018-02-28 12:44:25
Somebody sold at 6k.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:19:57
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:24:20
Did you just agree with your own post?
@_date: 2018-03-14 20:10:47
And turn off bluetooth, it kills the battery.
@_date: 2018-02-11 03:05:04
Indeed. Most people doing TA are planning their moves and managing their risk and the pigs and the sheep just laugh all the way to the slaughter house.
Doesn't bother me though. Someone's gotta buy high, sell low. Might as well not be me.
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:11:29
I like you
@_date: 2018-02-21 12:04:37


@_date: 2018-03-29 22:21:25
It's people cashing out for April fool's day.
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:40:33


So removing points that look like they could correspond lead to it looking like there's no correlation? How about providing the correlation coefficient before removing this pertinent data...
This is like matching footprints in a thief's tracks to his feet. It looks like there's a correlation... until you throw out all the footprints that match.
@_date: 2018-02-18 13:58:21
Translation: I hope it goes up fast enough so I can empty my bags and then fit into my goal of buying at 6k cause, gosh darn I just missed it!
@_date: 2018-02-13 00:08:28
Why are you buying on coinbase? Use an exchange.
@_date: 2018-07-19 16:01:13
There's nothing wrong with margin trading. Bitmex allows people to take it to ridiculous lengths though, where you can use up to 100x leverage and get liquidated on a market move of 1%. Financial suicide.
Nothing wrong with 2-5x though, if you know what you're doing and can manage your position well.
@_date: 2018-07-19 17:18:54
Yeah, Kraken's pretty good. Their margin trading is limited though.
They allow BTC 2 - 5x, ETH 2 - 5x, ETC 2x and XMR 2x. Though the up to 5x on BTC and ETH is a higher margin limit than most big exchanges allow. For example Bitfinex' limit is 3.3x.
Personally, I've never seen a need to go above 3x. Hell, I get anxious above that level.
@_date: 2018-04-11 18:45:38
Lol sure. I'd make sure to make a fool of myself on an alt account too. I'd be fucking embarassed to have this in my history.
@_date: 2018-04-21 16:37:25
Your mistake was listening to Tone Vays. The guy is always super bearish, and whatever the current low is he'll predict a lower one. When BTC peaked at 10k last year he was already talking about a 2k scenario right after.
@_date: 2018-04-10 12:31:58


Opinion discarded.
@_date: 2018-04-16 09:49:08
But only two of these fits your narrative. For $10 and $10,000 most of the crash had already happened before it hit either of those numbers.
@_date: 2018-04-10 12:27:44
This is a blatant misunderstanding of risk management.
A 50/50 W/L rate is not bad but what's important is your risk to reward. If you take a long position with reason to believe your position will go up 9% and you set a stop loss at -3% then you've got a 3:1 risk to reward.
If you consistently win 50% of your trades but only take trades with a 2:1 risk to reward ratio or greater then you make a net profit over time.
