No guarantee btc is the ONE.  What if a crypto alternate becomes the one.  Crypto is a speculative asset.  Believe it or not early stage asset class investment is very risky.   This is not current google/amazon with a clear wide moat of success. This is Compuserve vs aol vs Microsoft shit. Crypto are financial-tech stocks, a new hybrid asset class.

Do you understand the power of a an economic state powerhouse like China's ability to do whatever they want economically? Do you understand Chinese capital controls?  If the aim is to coerce miners into selling at market rate off the books, so be it.  I guess the only way to find out if this is possible is a Chinese miner insider leak!

They can go through custodial lightning services; they will pay smaller fees to open a channel directly on lightning preloaded with a set amount of satoshis.  As costs come down for lightning nodes and poor can afford the bandwidth to run their own lightning node, they switch to non-custodial.  Or families/towns can collaborate to create a mini-custodial node to further reduce costs and increase autonomy.

That is correct, but as the cost of transactions has been recently unstable with greater use of btc network, low income folks can be priced out of bitcoins most decentralized autonomous layers.  This will be a persistent issue for low income individuals.  This is where the lightning network, a bitcoin 2nd layer comes in.  This network is also autonomous decentralized layer, but with lower cost of transactions. On boarding and transacting here will always be much cheaper.  
On lightning, being able to hold your own private keys will depend on ones ability to operate their own server for this layer ( know as a “node”). There are costs here as well that may interfere with low income individuals to hold their own keys.  But overall cheaper than bitcoin layer 1, when you factor in frequent transactions and their associated layer 1 possible high transaction fees.  New “Banks” will allow fiat for satoshi exchange to either lightning custodial or non custodial nodes.  So in sum, there will be more costs for users to eliminate third parties in lightning layer.
Cost of running non custodial lightning node: $200 up front; initial satoshi deposit and reliable monthly internet access for node upkeep.

Looks like the bitcoin cartel (whales can cheat through market manipulation) is more dominant than the banking cartel currently.  In terms of decentralization of wealth; bitcoin has a ways to go.  Invest accordingly.

@_date: 2019-06-30 03:08:48
Thats a small amount of satoshis, not even enough for reserves to close the channel fees.  So what you sent is probably just reserves at this point you might need at least 30,000 sata

LTC atomic swaps onto lightning network are available already through boltz.  LTC and other lightning enabled BTC fork fodder will provide low cost on-boarding.  It will be multi-tier crypto security system.  BTC:  security.  LTC  security and so on.  Whichever risk one can afford via on chain fees will lead one to determine where they fit in on the two tier security system.
@_date: 2019-04-29 15:06:31
This just isn’t possible. Without atomic swaps, closing channels (and withdrawing from lightning contract) is still kind of a mess, due to UI and due to onchain transactions fees.  I like their use of external atomic swap provider idea, as it simplifies the concept.  Basically BlueWallet gives you instant liquidity and bigger transaction sizes. To do that with  your own node would be hours of work and a lot more satoshis locked in to channels.
Lightning is so alpha almost beta.

will this ever be approved? many current bitcoin holders will not want the risks of government and other institutional blow-back caused by the ability of dark web cloaked electronic transactions within bitcoin.  Bitcoin is the most government and regulatory friendly cryptocurrency model; anything that infringes on that will be a major risk and NOT following with the original intention.
Everyone has something to hide; people, governments, financial institutions; but is privacy a continuum that should exist as a necessary component of bitcoin? Should we dilute our trusted and verified system with the resulting glaring/suspicious eyes of law enforcement agencies?  I say keep bitcoin clear and transparent with only the small pieces of privacy available right now.

I see Blue wallet heading this way, but these will be centralized channels.  I come from a centralized world, i can handle a centralized lightning channel.  When lightning becomes truly widespread i will run my own lightning node for maximum security and confidence but really that is only needed if i am doing large transactions off chain.

I just followed suit.  A couple pain points, I played this roulette game on a desktop and it was not intuitive on withdrawal of satoshis from the website (possibly just missing basic noob info on withdraw page) to first build the receive invoice on my blue wallet app.  I kept filling in the invoice box with a just a few letters like it was a "notes" entry box.  Lightning network sending is intuitive; receiving/setting up invoices is quite strange.  I emailed the invoice to my computer browser and then cut and paste it into the website, worked instantly but one blue wallet hiccup; I had to delete the "lightning" word that came automatically built into the string for the site to accept the invoice.  My wife would never have been able to figure out those two things.

The top moat maker is in great position to be the Microsoft of lightning.  At first glance this appears to be governance through a strictly capitalist open competition with a sprinkle of altruism to adhere to the BOLT specs. 
Financial gain to support these orgs/companies would be through additional channel fees deducted when wallets are built via easily onboarding centralized nodes (blue wallet, wallet of satoshi) and those building the fee earning large secure pass through nodes.
Casa node product seems the most altruistic here, as there are no payment infrastructure possible from open source wallet in personal node designers.  Other than their possible eventual desire to charge annual fees for their updateable software based node design.
As one commenter said lightning is a “jungle” and i see it more wild than even layer 1.  Capitalism without checks and balances from governance breeds monopolies and ultimately exploitation via nepotism and cronyism.  All I can hope is that these types of practices are much more difficult in the visible and transparent blockchain world, although when privacy is expanded those potential protective benefits are possibly lost by hiding the trail of dishonest entities.
Bitcoin’s open-source base layer design appears to me to be an almost pure uncorruptable example of capitalism.  I’m not sure if layer 2 can live up to those standards, but I hope it can.

Seems like Zap is also its own implementation. Are they all communicating effectively with each other? And is one dominating the landscape? Basically each has developed their own node structure?

These seem to be the most competitive live commercial on-boarding players.

Yes that is my understanding.  In blue wallet which don’t open individual channels, you only have access to your wallet in the “lnhub” node (an open source lightning hub software).  On bluewallet you are given a  private key for an lnhub style wallet that is transferable.

the wallet gives you your keys for layer 1 btc wallet.  (non-custodial)
the wallet gives you a personal LNDnode key for the layer 2 lightning wallet.  ( elective non-custodial option) the wallet also gives you a link to [zigzag.io]( where you can send your lightning funds to route back to a non-custodial layer 1 wallet ( elective non-custodial)
This wallet is electively custodial.  Many aspects of the btc network will always be non-custodial.  Look at almost all crypto exchanges, this is due to KYC!!
You can't be a bitcoin maximalist if you don't respect the non-privacy aspect of btc (which in acquisition is non-custodial by its government enforced KYC nature).  you better move along to the monero maximalist crowd if that is the case.

A friend works in a bank.  They hate bank wires because of the liability involved and that is probably why they charge extra for that service.  So following that, bitcoin would be similar, high liability, non reversibility of the transaction is an issue.  Any bank staff member assisting with transaction that makes a mistake (or crime/fraud) is pretty much bringing complete liability including all costs of funds onto the banks balance sheet.

I do see bitcoin as being used as p2p money, I am saying I don't think it will be the primary use case.  I think its primary widespread adoption will be as a store of value.  Some users will use it as P2P, but not the majority.  If bitcoin becomes the universal reserve currency it could further incentivize p2p use, but I think risk wise, people will still choose conventional banking routes because they desire reversibility of their transactions.
