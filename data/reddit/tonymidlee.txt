I guess hes talking about the private keys. what is the random number generator? how good is it ? I have the same question 
@_date: 2014-09-09 12:51:00
Nothing special about the title, I can not find the original post, but I do  recall that the email is just an ad: only 298 Yuan for some electronic device, you pay the mailman when you receive the product, from a chinese e-retailer jd (pretty much like amazon,   if you are interested)
yeah, the date is very strange though
@_date: 2017-02-27 09:29:00
Roger Ver always emphasizes he was the first , nothing else, I didnot trust that guy who endorseed Mtgox to get his money out. such a hypercritical.
@_date: 2017-02-18 21:07:35
You have to trust tails. 
@_date: 2017-02-19 03:10:03
Good job, thank you for the effort!
@_date: 2017-02-28 17:19:19
Good article, more people should read it. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 23:57:53
I did a transaction about three days ago, mycelium ,lowest fee , 0.26 mbtc,  confirmed four hours later I remember. Its OK.
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:01:55
It is about time.I always vision this feature being part of bitcoin network.All kinds of cool functions attached to Bitcoin the backbone!
@_date: 2017-03-18 08:01:43
But I guess we  can try a RAM-intense problem, say 16GB , which would make ASIC impossible.
@_date: 2017-03-30 03:34:33
Now UASF or Pows, ASAP, get this clown out of my way!
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:32:22
Thank you, Luke!  For all you have done   for the Bitcoin community!
@_date: 2017-03-25 04:12:49
UASF ASAP
@_date: 2017-03-01 09:40:27
Let's propose 800M block size, so soon the only one could afford a full node would be Roger V, no more contentious any more, Right? You got your king
@_date: 2017-03-31 16:25:55
April 1 joke? A good one.
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:47:05
They are paid troll , they can shamelessly curse anybody even their own parents for money, no surprise there.
@_date: 2017-03-29 01:34:11
Too soon.You need time to get people onboard. As much as I agree with BIP 148, I don't want to be as reckless as those BU guys.
@_date: 2017-03-01 09:59:26
I think this is totally BS, go find your fast  alt coin, there are plenty of them 
@_date: 2017-03-24 12:51:34
Well said.  Let's defend our real Bitcoin to death!
@_date: 2017-03-02 10:01:44
Roger does have a lot of money to spend around, my guess is he didnot lose money in Mtgox, wonder why?
@_date: 2015-05-25 17:56:55
I didnot  realize Roger Ver had a contract to say “MtGox is solvent!”, how much did they offer?
@_date: 2017-03-27 16:29:13
I agree with you on almost every point.
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:57:00
Very interesting idea, some experts please tell us if this method  works, pros   and cons.
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:28:10
UASF ASAP, let's end the whole BU shitshow!
@_date: 2017-03-26 11:32:22
Good move , and I believe if miners know more about segwit, most of them might make the similar move in the near future.
@_date: 2017-03-26 15:39:48
What a self crowned clown. I think this time we can finally get rid it.
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:14:36
This actually is a well informed piece of article, which emphasizes the most important value of bitcoin. That is why I would pick bitcoin over eth for a bright future.
@_date: 2017-04-02 12:02:32
UASF，ASAP，and of course algo for PoW change to defend the decentralization to death.
@_date: 2017-04-04 03:56:24
Funny how come Segwit does not have "blocksize increase" feature in the table?
So 2.7M or more is a decrease or what? Help me with my math here. EPL5.
@_date: 2017-04-24 22:47:00
You smell like a BUllshit. On-chain usage isn't a burden? What an idiotic claim. And you have no idea about bitcoin,do you? Segwit is a softfork, not a hardfork.  UASF is a softfork too, and we will get segwit via UASF. Mark my word, there will be no MASF from now on.
@_date: 2017-04-21 14:01:25
Then you can go back to kiss your beloved king Jihad. 
@_date: 2017-04-22 13:19:01
You guys didn't realize that the war is lost and wait for the markets to dump the shit china coin. Mark my word.
@_date: 2017-04-23 07:39:26
UASF should be added in core as an option,not default but optional. Why the devs don't have the vision? MASF would never work in bitcoin, unless we all kneel down to the Chinese mining cartels. Wake up !
@_date: 2017-04-12 17:16:07
Tell them what we users want, segwit+UASF. We should all go to an exchange who support UASF.
@_date: 2017-04-13 07:09:09
I guess this clown is attempting to short bitcoin, flip flop according to his position.
@_date: 2017-04-04 17:09:17
Talking is cheap. He is a shameless liar. We love LN, so we block it. What kind of shit logic was that?
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:38:32
UASF， ASAP 
@_date: 2017-04-02 13:24:45
No,it should always be users choice from now on.If miners feel they are underpaid,they are always free to leave and get another job.After all we live in a free society,don't we?
@_date: 2017-04-21 14:54:49
Become another shitcoin?Hell no! It was devs fault, there should never be a MASF. Devs weakness made the current situation, UASF please. Miners should have no say in this matter.
@_date: 2017-04-07 03:31:45
Yeah, some signed binaries would be helpful. I remember luke said he would do it.
@_date: 2017-04-13 18:40:19
UASF,ASAP, and PoW change please.
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:36:50
Electrum can specify the fees manually. You should give it a try.
@_date: 2017-04-19 11:08:07
Because I would happily dump all the chinacoin in a heartbeat no matter how many miners behind it , and would not buy one even the price is one cent. Longest shitchain is still a shitchain.
@_date: 2017-04-05 08:24:29
That is simply a lie.
No, miners like money, not bitcoin.They dump bitcoin for fiat money every time.
Hodlers dump fiat money for bitcoin, and they are the true believers.
@_date: 2017-04-23 07:33:29
UASF should be added in core as an option,not default but optional. Why the devs don't have the vision? MASF would never work in bitcoin, unless we all kneel down to the Chinese mining cartels. Wake up !
@_date: 2017-04-10 14:19:56
Just signaled UASF an hour ago.  Inside VPN and behind a firewall, wondering if  visible to others?
@_date: 2017-04-02 02:58:03
UASF，ASAP .
@_date: 2017-04-04 17:18:58
Let's do it. UASF, ASAP , to prevent bitcoin become shitcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-01 12:05:35
I am The Bitcoin expert,
and I approve this message.
@_date: 2017-04-10 12:22:57
Segwit and lightning would make it much easier, can't wait to see them activated via UASF.
@_date: 2017-04-21 13:59:14
Pathetic, litecoin officially becomes shitcoin controlled by a couple of Chinese mining overloads. 
@_date: 2017-04-09 16:49:26
We should all move our trading to UASF exchange, say bitfinex, to show our support.
@_date: 2017-04-04 16:46:16
THANK you for the faq, well done.
@_date: 2017-04-19 10:56:35
It would only take a couple of major exchanges to make it work. UASF, ASAP.
@_date: 2017-04-04 04:35:00
I am a bitcoin expert, and I VERify this message.
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:28:55
Thank you for the wonderful work! People like you are the reasons I have so much faith in bitcoins future!
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:11:57
Not if you get well paid, say ten times the salary.
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:24:54
Good move Bitmex. No2X to those suckers!
@_date: 2017-10-15 13:32:42
Keep up with the good work. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:52:29
I downvote you because you are a liar. Have you heard about segwit and the capacity up to about 4Mb? Most of the bigblockers copy Ver's lies and spread them, just pathetic!
@_date: 2015-04-02 06:09:18
1. no internet?
2. try a less amount, minus transaction fee?
3.  reboot your phone?
4. wait for 6 more confirmation?
5 .... dont know
@_date: 2017-05-08 03:33:07
They don't need your love. They need asicboost, which is millions of dollars profit. So again, I must send fucks to them and fork off.
@_date: 2017-05-08 14:15:55
Thank you shaolinfry and whoever contributing to bip149!
UASF should be used for every upgrade from now on, no MASF please.
@_date: 2017-05-08 03:28:40
I will send my shinny middle finger to those asicboost miners. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 07:15:15
Thank god finally! How dare you devs betray our holy bible ! How dare
@_date: 2017-05-30 01:46:35
I surely hope so. The clock is ticking!
@_date: 2017-05-08 02:00:03
UASF , ASAP. Miners should not have any say in the matter of upgrading, go ahead with UASF .
Always be PoW change ready in case miners attack.
I would rather die than have a shit-china-miners-cartels-coin.
@_date: 2017-05-08 15:00:52
Call or email your exchange or shops, expressing what you want.
@_date: 2017-05-04 07:05:33
Yup. Rick and Morty to be precise
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:41:37
Thanks! Keep up the excellent work!
 August 1, Independence day!
@_date: 2017-05-17 12:40:53
Why not find your master miners and master devs, kneel down, receive the order and fork off?  Pity your Jesus only exists on r/btc
@_date: 2017-05-18 21:08:58
I AM IN. I want segwit. It would not be blocked by miners, who are merely being hired to do their job and get paid. 
 WANT MY DECENTRALIZED BITCOIN
@_date: 2017-05-18 21:34:22
Bitcoin is dead to me if miners can stop tech upgrade and users have to beg.
@_date: 2017-05-13 04:48:41
Finally! Where is the nearest Starbucks?
@_date: 2017-05-12 00:06:03
The only thing between bitcoin and low fee is greedy miners and asicboost. OK, two things maybe
@_date: 2017-05-10 14:56:09
If he doesn't fork, let's help him.
UASF  Bip 148
@_date: 2017-05-17 02:13:50
How about segwit now,which gives you more than 2MB?
Then we can talk about onchain scaling,which is a hardfork and requires time to prepare.
@_date: 2017-05-02 17:16:01
It's natural that bitpay doesn't want segwit, LN would threaten their business model.
@_date: 2017-05-10 23:33:38
@_date: 2017-05-30 01:27:54
Please do so. Devs give the miners the power to vote, but hold back the users option. That's just purely wrong. It's a soft fork, which activates segwit. 
IMO, it's long overdue. Devs, grow some pairs and show us what bitcoiners are really made of!
@_date: 2017-05-19 08:02:23
I feel the same. If we need to beg the miner cartels to get any tech upgrade from now on, then that bitcoin is dead to me. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 12:32:02
How about we add 20MB per year no matter what happens? Pinky finger, everyone? 
@_date: 2017-05-04 06:58:40
I am Satoshi, please stop! I lost my keys due to a fire accident. Love you guys ! 
@_date: 2017-05-04 07:28:44
So people still think 1.7&lt;1 , 2.7&lt;1 , 3.7&lt;1 ? Who are your math teachers? 
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:22:02
They are innocent.It's not them. It's asicboost who is doing all the evil. The miners are good people.
@_date: 2015-02-17 18:17:31
I did not know some of the charities. Keep up your good work!
@_date: 2017-05-05 05:38:51
Most likely it's your computer got virus.

@_date: 2015-02-25 02:39:01
here I am!
@_date: 2017-06-06 08:59:18
 am the CEO of multiple big exchanges and wallets, and I support BIP 148/UASF.
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:08:17
This is the best news I can imagine since the scaling debate started. Go fork off china coin! 
@_date: 2017-06-04 05:03:57
Very good analysis. Must read for every bitcoin ecosystem player.
@_date: 2017-06-03 14:13:31
I wouldn't pay a dime for those china/covertboostcoin. That's my choice. It's not only a wish, it is an action. 
Good lucky with your HF/1000M/paypalcoin, and we will have the best devs,not those BU closedsource/crashing BUshitcoin led by self -crowned clown bitcoin president.
@_date: 2017-06-17 13:31:17
I am very disappointed that the devs don't have the guts to include optional BIP148/UASF. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 08:10:31
Bitcoin users decide what and when to upgrade, not the miners, who are well paid to do a simple job! 
Fork off or fuck off!
  BIP 148 
 bitcoin
@_date: 2017-06-03 16:12:07
Actually I did. 
My action and other users action of dumping shitcoin is exactly the SAY.
And for the other question, don't you forget that who coded segwit?
@_date: 2017-06-03 17:06:11
I Guess they must have lost too many bitcoin customers due to congested network.
Any company that accepts bitcoin should stand up and support BIP148/UASF.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:42:03
I believe they have all been making the argument more complex than it should be. 
 the segwit coin has even a slightly higher price(which I believe it will), then its a guaranteed win, period.
@_date: 2017-06-17 15:48:09
I don't argue with paid morons. I just run my bip148/uasf. See you after August 1.
@_date: 2017-06-03 11:01:16
Miners would follow the money. If the segwit chain are not welcomed by the markets, it will die and miners would not stay. I am willing to bet on the opposite though. 
There should be no miners vote from the beginning.This situation is caused by incompetent proposal coined by some coder I will not name.
Again, bitcoin is as dead to me if paid miners could stop tech upgrade because they want more fees and profit from congested network.
Oh , did I mention
 Asicboost
 should have zero say in protocol upgrade, period.
@_date: 2017-06-17 04:16:23
No! under this circumstance, the worst thing is that a few miners could stop tech upgrade, which is not the bitcoin I signed up to.
 or die
@_date: 2017-06-19 03:09:33
When it's properly coded and well tested. I think one year might do.
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:23:39
Please do so. It's long overdue.
 BIP 148 into core!
@_date: 2017-06-05 17:32:20
Exactly. Mining is not, and that is why we want BIP 148/UASF.
@_date: 2017-06-05 17:25:54
You mean it relies on bitmain?
 fuck no! that single thought makes me sick!!! I would rather die than touch those chinacoin!
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:53:08
Asicboost coin to be precise.
