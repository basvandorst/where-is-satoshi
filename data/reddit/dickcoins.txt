nah, I'm pretty certain prison sucks without having to visit.  It's why  why i avoided the whole illicit drug trade for a living thing and got a real job.  Life choices, you know?

How is it false?  Transaction fees easily exceeded $5 just a few months ago.  Here is some factual data for you: [
EOS is proving that synchronizing a handful of nodes is far cheaper/cost effective than synchronizing 10,000 nodes, and that is what u/Cobra-Bitcoin is essentially saying.  Centralized (technically centralized, not necessarily governance) services are cheaper to run, hands down.
@_date: 2018-08-02 13:13:07
bitcoin transaction fees were something like $50 in January, right?  Even if only $1 was being transfered, right?
Don't get all uppity and comfortable as if CC isn't susceptible to reality on occasion.

I believe there is a pirate in prison for several life terms because what you say is false.
@_date: 2018-08-01 20:06:09


1) Just because the invistigators were also crooks doesn't mean that Ross's illegal activity running a website offering illegal drugs and services should be excused.  2 wrongs don't make anything right.


2) Lot's of non-violent acts get life. What's unprecedented is that equivalent punishment is being applied to a young educated white male.  [ "Over 3,200 people nationwide are serving life terms without a chance of parole for nonviolent offenses. Of those prisoners, 80 percent are behind bars for drug-related convictions: 65 percent are African-American, 18 percent are Latino, and 16 percent are white. The [ACLU]( has called the statistics proof of "extreme racial disparities."


3) As long as you ignore the conditions under which the drugs are grown, processed, and the murder mayhem over turf disputes in the areas where the illicit drugs are prominent.  Oh, and the lives and families that they destroy.  I mean, yeah, as long as we ignore that, it's all fine.
@_date: 2018-08-02 17:19:57
So you agree Cobra-Bitcoin's statement is not false?  Because despite all that typing, your median fees graph agreed with the initial statement.  
@_date: 2018-08-01 06:34:20
I think he enabled a high level of illicit drug sales internationally.  Would you consider El Chappo and the like a hero? no, you wouldn't? Than neither is Ross.
@_date: 2018-08-02 17:15:37
about 0.70 cents.  "What the actual fuck" is a bit dramatic though.  Like, calm down and grow up.
@_date: 2018-08-01 06:27:23
If he was a black or mexican guy whom only sold wholesale to the street dealers in your neighborhood and got busted, i suspect no one would have any problem.  As the top level organizer of black market drug deals, his case is no different.  Considering the amount of product that was pushed, his setence is more than fair.  But because he's a pretty white guy that's educated, somehow we should be lenient.  I don't think so, imho.
@_date: 2018-05-22 03:08:55
I think I understood what you meant, I'm correcting the logic though.  The way it was stated is illogical.
@_date: 2018-08-02 17:14:23
right, which is cool.  But "what the actual fuck?" is a bit dramatic.  Like, it's a reasonable fee for the service provided, all things considered (like fraud protection, the ability to borrow from your credit card, etc).
@_date: 2018-08-01 06:30:18
According to wikipedia, 50 years (25 years before eligible for parole for *each* life sentence).  [
@_date: 2018-05-22 00:15:36


a majority reason why Ross is in prison is because of the sheer number of low-level drug dealers on the silk road platform.  The only reason it was not used for prostitution was because it wasn't permitted on the site, certainly not because low life's wouldn't have gladly trafficked girls for the coin.
@_date: 2018-05-22 15:11:37
because our society is based on the collection and distribution of taxes to build public architecture. The idea of an anonymous currency going to rule the world makes no sense - unless you want to live in a Mad Max like world, and I imagine most people wont.

1) it's not a massive piece of information. It's completely irrelevant to the crimes Ross committed.  It's information that does not alter in any way what Ross was doing.  The only purpose to present it to gain some comparative sympathy, which again, has no bearing on the crimes that were actually committed.
2) If you read the quote more carefully, it's not my "obsession with race", but rather a statistically sound anecdote.
3) "Constantly minorities and non-whites are over prosecuted for the same crimes as whites. Mainly due to the lack of a decent defense lawyer which is essential in the United States justice system." ...... if that is not a bias racist system, I don't really know what is.
4) you started with "what the hell am i talking about", and I think you understand quite clearly now what I'm talking about.  Ross's sentence was adequate for the crime, and not unique to his case.  You might be of the opinion that the entirety of America and the media does not see color and would be just as happy to rally the flag if he were black, but last I checked they were still holding KKK rallies and defending Confederates statues of Generals that defended slavery right now in 2018.  So quite frankly, it is my opinion that the only reason anyone here gives a fuck is because he's a spoiled white techy, and that's it.  
p.s. - funny enough, white was only 1/3 of the adjetives I used in my initial statement - but it's the only one that you continue to see.  Whom is the one really obsessed with race?

well.....it is a US company.  I suppose using an AU bank from the US would also have such fees attached.
@_date: 2018-08-01 20:15:32
It's not a false equivalence at all because he profited from each and every one of those transactions.  People think that his motivation was purely to enable drug sales from adult to adult, but the reality is his motivation was to make himself wealthy.  His greed was his downfall, and ultimately the reason for his double life sentence.  Had he pleaded guilty, as he was, than he could have had a reduced sentence.  
@_date: 2018-08-02 02:40:26
My apologies for making observations beyond your initial comment. and world view, I thought these thread were for conversations.  Next time I'll ignore all else of reality and only focus on you, so here we go....
"Anyone who thinks Ross got what he deserved needs to study this unprecedented case. And start with the fact that the investigators that went after him have been proven to be criminals and are in jail."
\-- I'll start with the fact that the investigators went to jail.  Ok, that fact is irrelevant to Ross Ulbrichs crimes or sentence, so we can throw it out from the discussion and move on.
\-- After a thorough internet search, it's not an unprecedented case or sentence.  As you can see from his own twitter feeds, several other inmates have similar sentences for non-violent crimes.

people involved in organized crime responsible for thousands of deaths against civilians are not hero's.  The illicit drug trade happens to have those precise people at the top.

That would be fucking hilarious if two people got dresed in bitcoin shirts and went door to door asking "Have you heard the Word of Bitcoin?  Blockchain is the salvation for our nation!", and then went on to preach about bitcoin.  That would really help our image I think.

people focus too much on bitcoin in replacing fiat in our first-world nations - it's a bit silly because replacing the dollar or euro with any other currency doesn't make fundamental sense, these fiats are already the best in the business, top notch, grade A, more valuable than any other currency in the world.  I'm not saying we can't use it - it's just hardly necessary because it doesn't benefit us much.
Now, compare that to 2nd and 3rd wold nations with banana's monetary policy and diminishing value because 1st worlds like to stay 1st worlds - and now the value of a global currency starts to shine.  
tl;dr - bitcoin is way more useful for 2nd and 3rd wold nations than our 1st world nation. You will find it succeeds in those countries well before it will succeed in ours, if ever.

Condition 2 is:
I must own the secret key of "qwertyuiopasdfghj"! Here, no time lock applies.
Condition 2 is that you must have the private keys for "qwertyuiopasdfghj" AND "1AbCdEfGhjKLmNpQrStUvW" - Otherwise you are asking the thief to believe you accepted 1BTC from "qwertyuiopasdfghj" and are allowing them to reclaim the 1BTC at any time, without your consent - which would be stupid.

You probably have never been scammed before.  It goes more like this. Bad person takes control of good merchants ebay account, sells a bunch of high price items, takes the funds - your not aware nothing is coming until it's way too late.  If you wired them money, the money is gone - this is bitcoin.  If you paid through PayPal, or a credit card, there is a good chance you can personally get the funds back.  Either your financial institution will be able to claw it back from wherever they sent it, or will eat it as part of fraud losses.  With Bitcoin, it's like sending cash option.  And if I may say from experience, it's a bad one.

yes, the fed reserve is the devil and it has nothing to do with a growing global economy during that time.  
the reason few people take bitcoin seriously is because bitcoin enthusiasts are not taking any time to do real economic modeling and instead rely's on meme's.  Bitcoin and it's uneducated class will be it's own demise.

well, it's not free, and providing mis-information as such give's fud'ers ammo, so please don't say that.
it's funny that "instant" is seen as a feature, when in reality the banks have an intentional settlement period which helps in events of disputes and fraud.  e.g. - "not instant" is actually a feature rather than some technical limitation.  This failure of the cryptocurrency community to recognize this reality quite possibly may be a fundamental part of it's demise.
