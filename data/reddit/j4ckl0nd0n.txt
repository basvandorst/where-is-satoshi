The particular bar I was referencing was the first brick &amp; mortar establishment in the world to accept Bitcoin. They hold regular meetups there.
I hate how people in this community are so quick to write off anyone criticizing our precious Bitcoin. You GUYS I'm ON YOUR SIDE. I want nothing more than for BTC to succeed. I use it weekly. I'm a big time hodlr and evangelist. I'm always being realistically critical.

Yes, that is correct and all fine and well. I also had to wait 25 mins for a 15 BTC transaction and 90 mins for a 2 BTC transaction to get just 1 confirmation on the blockchain.
My point still stands, that's a terrible user experience that makes newcomers (and myself) weary of using Bitcoin.

I had to wait 25 mins for an in person wallet to wallet transaction of 15 BTC to verify on the blockchain... makes for awkward "sale" of a product with a stranger. Another time a 2 BTC purchase from a friend took 1.5 hrs to complete.
I'm not trolling or being negative for negative sake. This has me mildly worried about state of the blockchain and scaling issues.

This has been a consistent experience for me the last couple months on multiple "pay with Bitcoin" websites, as well as in person buying food at a bar that accepts Bitcoin. Was a TOTAL date fail "hey lemme show you this awesome digital currency..." 15 minutes later we could leave the bar.
I think comments like yours are dangerously ignoring some aspects of Bitcoin and its user adoption.
