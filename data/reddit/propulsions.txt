I mean that's only 2 bitcoin. Anyone who's been involved for a while has substantially more than that.

SSD failure in a raid 0. Wallet wasn't backed up for three days. Entirely my fault.
Before anyone says anything, it shipped from the factory in a raid 0 array and was less then 30 days old.

It helps when you say what type of computer system your running. 
Regardless, I'm going to assume Windows. Go to the search box and type in %appdata% hit enter.
Now you should see a folder named roaming. Click that. Finally you'll see a folder called bitcoin. 
Inside that folder is two folders: chainstate and blocks. Remove the folder blocks. Boom! Massive amounts of free space restored.
Warning, do not delete the file wallet.DAT or you'll loose your money. Also, good luck trying to synch bitcoin again after nuking the blocks. It's going to take a loooooong time. ;)

Technically speaking aside, running Bitcoin-qt/core without your port forwarded is worthless for the network. 
Theoretically speaking, you could even argue that it hurts the network.

Seriously? Do some research. Go on IRC Freenode  and ask there. Or make a new thread here and ask. 
Bitcoin is pseudo-anonymous that's it. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 13:18:44
Because you are always able to trace sending and receiving  transactions.

There is absolutely no reason for them to pack up shop and leave. They're making a killing in commissions. If anything BTC-E has been one of the better exchanges I've used.  
@_date: 2014-07-11 15:20:45
Yes! Now if Bitfinex can offer branding on these cards or some sort of discount when linked with their exchange, it would be magical!

I agree, yesterday she looked giddy and escalated in her interviews. Today, she only looks exhausted and appears to be a little more apprehensive to talk about the article.
Not surprising considering that she was doxed herself.

It's the opposite of anonymous. In fact, privacy rights advocates would cry if they knew exactly how Bitcoin works.

Maybe he has a bad address?! I just sent an email to the CEO of Bitcoin. Only received a canned response though. "We'll look into it. Please provide verification documents." Maybe it's because we sent him half increments? Idk but the bitcoins should definitely be at his address soon.

If you use Bitcoin-qt/Bitcoin core, you shouldn't worry unless you made a Bitcoin.conf file with the following line.

99% of you are safe.
@_date: 2014-05-20 21:01:09
Yeah you can but how do you fund those addresses without linking them to yourself?
@_date: 2014-04-12 00:38:04
With your port forwarded to accept incoming connections. If not, then you're just a leach.
@_date: 2014-02-18 08:46:22
As am I. 
@_date: 2014-05-09 05:34:44
It's even less anonymous then just knowing the one email address though. Now you know every single email sent and received ever from that email address.

Two people have actually tried to recover the data already with a third working on it currently.
It's a crazy weird setup where there are two physical 128gb chips on a single HDD acting as a raid 0. 
The computer is an acer aspire s7 if anyone was wondering. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 20:30:32
It's cumbersome funding those addresses without linking the address with any of your old ones.
@_date: 2014-04-22 23:02:00
Java *shudder. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 21:15:39
No it does not. The tracking starts with the funding address. Keys call it address known. Address known now transfers to your freshly created new address. 
There is still a link between the known address and the new freshly created one.

Brah I've been in the crypto scene for a very long time. This is literally the best advice.
Second best advice I can give is when everyones making moon memes and yelling the train can't stop, it's time to sell. 
Final advice is - if you're able - put in buy orders at ridiculously low prices. Usually, they'll fill. Set em and forget em. A buy order of mine was just filled yesterday after multiple months. 
Good luck not watching the price!
