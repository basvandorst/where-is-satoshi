It is true though that producing an ASIC is orders of magnitude harder, and usually costs quite a bit of money to get it fabricated by a custom fab plant. (Millions of dollars.)
Still... an ASIC *can* deliver the kind of performance listed. You're basically implementing the algorithm in silico. Once you've designed one SHA-256 unit in silico, you can pipeline it, so a well-designed ASIC could do multiple hashes per clock cycle. The NSA is rumored to be able to brute force smaller key sizes for various algorithms with custom ASICs.

After doing some more digging, I am leaning toward FUD on this claim. Everything points to BFL being a legitimate company with designs on the larger cryptography ASIC market beyond Bitcoin. If it is a scam, it's an elaborate one that included shipping real products. So elaborate, in fact, that I don't see why you wouldn't just build a real ASIC and go legit. Less risky and potentially more money... the expertise you'd build could get you into some relatively high-margin custom engineering areas, NSA contracts, or maybe get bought by one of the big network hardware manufacturers (Cisco, Juniper, etc.). I mean... what's the point of a scam that is almost as difficult as the legitimate business, and where successfully executing on the legit business would make you a multi-millionaire with no risk of jail time?
But Bitcoin is riddled with fraud and scams, that's for sure. Just like a real currency!

I think it's currently up in the air whether BTC will end up functioning as a full-blown currency or whether it will function as a form of decentralized, somewhat anonymous wire transfer.
In the latter scenario, the most common use case would be local currency -&gt; BTC -&gt; transaction -&gt; another local currency, with money not staying "in Bitcoin" for very long.
In that case it becomes a "meta-currency," or a decentralized alternative to banking systems.

It is discovering mathematical objects that can be used as currency for various purposes, so yes.

Just ask him straight up: if they don't ship by EOY will they refund peoples' money if people ask for it?
If not, *when* would the cutoff date be? If he refuses to give an answer or agree to any date, I'd take that as a pretty strong contrarian indicator.
If he doesn't ship or refund by... say... end of January (giving them time to slip a little, as engineering projects do), I'd contact the authorities.

Yuck. Would not do business with them now.
But I gotta say: you see this stuff in the business world *all the time*, including at companies that do not meet anyone's normal definition of a scam. Business just attracts scummy people. I've seen it first hand -- did a stint in business consulting. Sociopath and MBA are almost synonyms. You would not believe.
The fact of the matter is that scum become leaders because of human nature -- because they are charismatic, command authority, and display dominance gestures. That is a problem that goes way beyond this little sandbox.
It doesn't mean BFL's products are fake... though I think a scam is now a distinct possibility. Proof is in the pudding. If they don't ship by EOY I call scam.

I wonder: is there a better way to store wallets?
Right now the wallet.dat lives wherever it lives. If it is lost, actual BTC is lost. That seems like a Bad Thing... adding "breakage" to an already inherently deflationary currency with a limited total float.
As we see, it also opens the possibility of virtual theft.
What about some kind of distributed Kad network where each user's address can store its BTC encrypted with its private key? Then add passphrases and -- for added security -- physical security dongles or smartcard support. That way major holders of BTC could have smartcard encrypted public/private key pairs and the wallet could be stored "everywhere."
This would seem to make wallets more portable and reduce breakage and theft.

You underestimate the power of big data, data set correlation, and machine learning.
The problem for a powerful entity or nation state can be framed thus:
You have a set of keys (Bitcoin addresses) representing transaction peers. Some of these keys' identities are known (MtGox addresses, people taking no privacy precautions, etc.) and some are not. Find the unknowns using:
 * The entire Facebook database.
 * The entire Twitter database
 * Two years of network flow data
 * Apple and Google's mobile phone location tracking databases
 * Whatever the NSA squirrels away in those massive data centers
 * Google's e-mail cache and web crawl cache
 * Anything else you can obtain from a major Internet company using the virtually unlimited post-Patriot-act powers you have. (In countries like Iran and China, powers are even more unlimited... and don't think such data sets are not available for enough cash on the spook black market. I'm sure they are.)
These data sets are already subject to a lot of correlation analysis, mapping unknown to known identities and correlating and clustering events in time. You can leverage this.
You also have the option of gumshoe police work. "My name is officer suchandsuch. That guy who met you from LocalBitcoin a few weeks ago..."
For addresses with a single transaction, you already know something: they are likely throw-aways. But the entire block chain is visible, complete with timestamps.
My point isn't that Bitcoin *can't* be used anonymously, but that it is not inherently safer than traditional currencies for nefarious purposes. I'm actually debunking the "Bitcoin is a free-for-all for criminals!" nonsense. If anything, using Bitcoin safely for crime requires *more* technical sophistication than other methods.

Edit: his felony is related to online gambling, which is not necessarily *fraud* per se in the objective sense. A gambler knows what they're signing up for. If that's all it is, I don't consider it a big deal, and I can see how someone like that would be attracted to the fabulously weird experiment in financial we-don't-quite-know-what-it-is-yet that is Bitcoin.
A Google image search turns up stuff like this, which definitely makes it look legit: 
Seems to me that somebody found a less-sketchy business in the form of making money by selling shovels during a gold rush. The Bitcoin ASICs are also cool hacks in their own right, and could serve as great show pieces to break into the world of high-priced embedded and semiconductor consulting. I wouldn't be surprised if they could land a contract from somebody like the NSA now to build pipelined key-cracking ASICs or similar.
Hope it isn't a scam. I ordered a Jalapeno, mostly for fun hacker toy value. Just wanted the nerd points of having a custom SHA-256 ASIC on my desk. It's also f'ing cold in my office, so I can warm my hands with it assuming it dissipates 80 watts like it says.
@_date: 2012-12-19 16:22:11
Not saying they could, unless you slip up and include one of your anonymous addresses in a file that you upload somewhere in a way that can *in any way* be tied to your identity or to *any other piece of information* that can in *any way* through *any circuitous route* be tied to your identity or to the identity of *anyone else* who knows you or might be close to you on a social friend graph somewhere. Apply that also to the immediate precursors and successors in any block chain that includes any of your addresses.
A Bitcoin address is a globally unique identifier that is easy to search for in reams of data. Once an address is located, its neighboring data -- in time or space -- serves as a starting point for an autocorrelation exercise.
Again, all I'm saying is that Bitcoin is no instant panacea for evading surveillance. A person would have to be very careful to avoid information leakage, adopting and rigorously adhering to a set of information hygiene protocols.
@_date: 2012-09-23 16:23:49
Probably not that much. First of all, this is M1, not M3 (total float). In a credit economy, most dollars in circulation are credit, not cash. People underestimate how big this effect is, which is why Austrians get their hyper-inflation predictions wrong all the time. They would have to print *insane* amounts of M1 to cause hyperinflation. Ridiculous, crazy, head-spinning amounts...
Secondly, the major factor driving Bitcoin's value right now is the size of the Bitcoin economy. The more stuff becomes available in BTC and the more people use it, the higher its value will go (as it is a deflationary currency).
The long term effect is going to be interesting. To what extent with the standard issue Keynesian criticism of deflationary currencies apply: that they create an incentive to simply hoard the currency and not invest because the appreciation of the currency pays more interest than any safe investment?

I wonder if anyone's integrated a miner with a solar panel yet? Just put them in the sun and get BTC whenever it's up. Solar power is cheaper than grid power in many places if you neglect the cost of energy storage, and in this case running part-time is not really an issue so no storage is needed. Not sure it would beat Chinese BTC miners whose operators don't mind huffing mercury from un-scrubbed coal plants, but it'd probably be cheaper than mining from grid power in most places with actual environmental laws.

The mined BTC is "cached" in their service/side-chain, but can with a few commands be dumped to the actual block chain and sent anywhere including to your own wallet. They've basically got an in-cloud wallet like Coinbase with a micropayment system layered on it among other things.

It's a dev kit. It's common for developer kits to sell for a lot more than what you might get the hardware at in its final version or in bulk. I once worked on a TI DSP chip where the chips were like $3 but the dev kit was $500.
This is actually kind of cheap for a limited-run development kit of new hardware. I seriously doubt they are selling these much beyond cost. Look into how much an ASIC run costs per chip at less than say a million units.

Part of the idea is to make it dead-simple and plug-and-play to build a BTC-taking service. That's a value and reduces barrier to entry. If it seems expensive it's because it's a first-run dev kit, not a later stage higher volume production device. You're paying a dev kit premium for early access.

Imagine you have a tech company that owns a decentralized, cryptographically secure, high speed international wire transfer network. Now imagine that this company also has a well-recognized brand and millions of users.
How much is that company worth?
Now divide that number by the the total BTC "float" and there's your rational valuation for 1BTC.
Now imagine this wire transfer network works by allowing its stock to be used as a virtual currency. So transferring money into the network is equivalent to owning a share of the network, and transferring money out is equivalent to selling a share.
Weird? Sure. New things are often weird. But worthless and stupid? I doubt it. Twitter is a much more trivial, less useful thing and is worth billions. I also thought Twitter was the dumbest thing I'd ever heard of when I first heard of it. Good ideas often sound oddly stupid or trivial at first.
Edit: if our hypothetical Bitcoin, Inc. is worth 1 billion (PayPal was worth more), then that gives a rational value of around $47/BTC once all 21 million BTC are mined.

Thing is: I personally think BTC would be a poor base currency due to its extreme deflationary tendencies.
But what if it's not a currency? What if it's a weird hybrid between a bank, a stock (or ETF), and a wire transfer system? It has this interesting property that it can be used as any of these, in any combination. It can be a bank-- where your deposits are in this weird foreign meta-currency. It can be like a stock. Or you can just do cash-&gt;BTC-&gt;cash at the other end and use it as a decentralized Western Union.
That's neat.
It also has other weird properties, like the global visibility of the register. As a result, most if not all textbook macroeconomic stats can be computed in real-time by anyone or everyone, and nobody can cook the books. (Easily, or without being noticed... since a distributed attack on the network would be noticed.)
For example, it would be trivial to compute the velocity of Bitcoin *in real time* without relying on anyone like the Federal Reserve to provide statistics. The stats belong to everyone. So could you create a BTC-derived currency that behaved like Keynesian-style currency with a mathematically-ideal "virtual" central bank? Could you create mechanisms to do modern things like target nominal GDP, but again without a central bank?
I wonder if you could create decentralized financial instruments that would "fix" the problems caused by BTC's deflationary nature?
Lots of really fascinating possibilities.

Maybe in 20 years. Cracking large ECC keys would require practical quantum computers with thousands of coherent qubits (that remain coherent for a long period of time) that are capable of running Shor's algorithm.
The D-Wave machine is not that at all. It's really an experimental laboratory device for studying peculiar types of possibly-quantum algorithms, such as quantum simulated annealing, and it has its skeptics who don't see it as a true QC at all.
When/if big QC does arrives, there are classical algorithms believed to be resistant to it. Here's one that exists now, though better ones will probably exist once the problem is more thoroughly studied:
I don't think QC will be relevant to real-world crypto for quite some time.

"as long as it's sufficiently divisible. Prices just rise."
Prices fall in deflation, and sufficiently divisible is the problem. There is not enough gold to price the modern global economy in units that are *physically practical*, and computers did not exist back then to permit the kind of number games that would be required to deal with that.

Like I said: more technical sophistication than physical cash.
There's still things one could do, especially a nation state. The block chain links your transactions to all others. So even if yours are well anonymized, others may not be. Police work comes into play here -- including police work in the physical world. Identify the neighboring transactions, traverse the graph...
The most vulnerable point is the point where you either spend your Bitcoin on something traceable or convert it to/from other currencies. In other words: where you interface between BTC and physical reality.

This is something nobody seems to get, including most of the pop-Austrian crowd who screamed for hyperinflation for the last six years. The inflation will not come until monetary policy *tightens*.
That being said, will it? There's an argument to be made that the fed has now painted itself into a corner and is doomed to pump cheap money for a very long time ala Japan. Any rise in interest rates right now could re-pop housing and possibly pop the student loan bubble. The latter would hurt real bad, especially since student loans are typically non-bankruptable.

I really think people ought to look at running their own nodes more. One of the ideas of Bitcoin was decentralization and control of your own stuff. Just use stuff like MtGox, etc., to perform trades and exchanges or take payments on web sites and keep the bulk of your BTC in a wallet of your own (that you back up... and back up... and back up some more!).
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:38:21
I think you're more or less onto something, though I would urge a lot of caution.
Think of it this way: imagine Bitcoin is a tech startup with a decentralized, cryptographically secure, open global wire transfer system. How much would such a startup be worth if it already had millions of users? Keep in mind that simple mobile texting startups are being acquired for $1billion these days if they have a large user base.
You can think of the cumulative market value of BTC as a tech stock. Then it makes sense.
@_date: 2013-04-26 15:28:07
Yes and no. It's naive to think BTC can't be gamed and manipulated, especially since it's so small compared to the rest of the economy. It's also vulnerable to a whole slew of network-layer attacks (DDOS and such) that conventional financial systems aren't vulnerable to (in the same way). Then there's the fact that we know there are large hoards of BTC, and these could be used to cause major price changes in a coordinated manner. When mechanisms become available to short BTC expect to see hedged maneuvers in which large hoards are dumped to profit from price drops.
But it is a step away from the conventional financial system, and I'm fine with that. But *any* monetary system can be gamed, and with the stakes being real a lot of very smart people are always going to be trying to game it.

I don't disagree. But I also don't think Krugman is really thinking about Bitcoin. He thinks it's what the techno-libertarian college freshmen think it is, and it isn't.
It's not a currency. Not exactly. It's something like a hybrid between a tech stock, a currency, a commodity, and a wire transfer system, but is also more than the sum of those parts. It's a fundamental innovation, as evidenced by two overlapping things: its popularity and the fact that nobody gets it.
If Krugman thought about Bitcoin I think he'd see that, and I also think he'd have more interesting things to say than the typical Keynes vs. Hayek debate rehash.

I too find Austrianism conceptually appealing, but I get some of the counter-arguments.
To me 99% of Keynes is the concept of velocity. That's his *natural selection*, to provide an analogy to Darwin. Keynes realized that wealth is a function of the rate that money flows, and expressed this idea in concrete mathematical terms that could be studied.
A concise summary of Keynes could be: "money is not a noun, it's a verb."
(You can see velocity in practice. Riyadh, Saudi Arabia arguably has more wealth under its political control than New York. Which city is richer? Where would you rather be an entrepreneur?)
Everything else about his thinking is built around this concept. He did other things, sure, but that's the key innovation.
I find his deflationary spiral argument hard to counter, especially when you throw in human psychology. The idea is that once a deflationary spiral takes hold, people react *rationally* by hunkering down and saving. This reduces velocity, reduces peoples' ability to pay down debts, etc., which leads to a more conservative environment, which perpetuates the cycle.
If money is *increasing* in value and my wages go down, *rationally* I should shrug. If the rates match up, I am getting paid the same. In reality you get massive unemployment as people refuse to take "less" pay, even riots. Bigger number are better, our primate social brains tell us... even if we rationally know that they're not!
In its extreme version, a deflationary spiral could lead to a dark age. This could happen if the conservatism it engendered became encoded into rigid ideology -- if the culture as a whole shifted to a radically more conservative poise in economics and in other matters. Look at how anti-progressive and nostalgic ideologies grow during recessions. I think it would be easy for a very prolonged recession to lead to a "progress is over" mentality.
I wonder if this is what happened when Rome fell: an ideological encoding of a depression in the form of Medieval Christianity and Feudalism.
Inflationary money is a *hack* to fix this. It's a hack to get around a systematic bias in human cognition. So I understand where it comes from and why most nations end up going down that path. Note that most do-- regardless of ideology. When everyone does X and nobody does Y, I wonder if there's a reason. Everyone also uses AC power grids. Nobody uses DC power grids.
But at the same time, I very much dislike what central banks represent. I dislike the idea that there are unaccountable Politburos made up of a bunch of white coastal elites who all went to the same elite universities who have the power to pick winners in the economy. (And don't believe the denials around this... look into the bailouts. Winners were picked.) This is basically gangster statism.
I also dislike paper fiat money. It's too easy to debase and manipulate. It can be declared more or less valuable, or even void, by fiat. That's also gangster statism.
Present monetary systems are radically authoritarian, Plutocratic, and riddled with such extreme moral hazard that they can't help but be horribly corrupt.
But some of this is built on technical necessity. I think it might be like the electoral college-- a relic from the pre-computer age when tabulating the raw vote count quickly was impossible. What I wonder is whether we could keep the innovations of modern economics but ditch the bureaucrats.
That I think is the promise of the larger cryptocurrency revolution, of which Bitcoin is (I think) merely the first shudder. Money can now be software. It can be "smart," distributed, and open source! More than that-- we can *program* money to do anything we want. Money is Turing-complete.
We could even have competing monetary paradigms. If I were a trust fund brat who could sit around doing cool hacks, I'd be very tempted to investigate the possibility of creating a cryptocurrency that incorporated Keynes' equations and nominal GDP targeting intrinsically. I think that's possible, especially given the openness of the block chain and the resulting fact that any statistic such as velocity can be computed by any node in real time.
There's a lot of potential for innovation here. Remember when I said inflationary money was a hack? What if it's not the only possible hack that accomplishes this? What if there are other solutions? Open cryptocurrencies open the possibility of real competition, experimentation, and innovation.
@_date: 2013-06-03 13:06:15
This is the desired outcome, basically.
Inflationary money was invented to cope with a century of very rapid growth -- growth unprecedented in human history. In the absence of inflationary money, the incredible growth of the 20th century would have resulted in hyper-*deflation*. There literally would not have been enough money to price the economy.
It wasn't the result of some evil conspiracy as many libertarians and Austrian school types think. It was a hack -- perhaps an ugly one -- to cope with a real problem.
Keep in mind that it was invented before digital computers. Before computers, trading nanograms of gold would have been ridiculous. (And nanograms of gold is what it would have taken, maybe even smaller units. Can you put 10^-9 of a gold coin in your pocket? How many atoms of gold is that burrito?) Before computers, something like Bitcoin was impossible. There might be alternative ways of coping with deflation, but all the ones I can think of rely on the ability to compute macroeconomic statistics over the whole economy accurately in real-time. For example, I can imagine a tool that permits you to see the velocity-adjusted value of BTC, so if deflation occurs you could know whether the amount you are charging or getting paid is still *nominally* the same or not. You could do that now with the Bitcoin block chain's transparency, but you could not do that then. The ability to collate, distribute, and crunch that much data was simply science fiction before ~1990, and was not generally available until recently.
So fixed hard money might see a comeback soon, due to new technology changing the game. "Change the tools and you change the rules."
Another factor is that growth will probably slow in the 21st century due to demographics, fossil fuel depletion, and diminishing marginal returns on new wealth in already-wealthy societies. (Supply limits to growth and demand limits to growth.) So while inflationary money might have been an okay idea in the post-war 20th century, it might no longer be a great idea now. We might not see the growth that we need to see to maintain price stability in an inflationary environment or to service high levels of debt outstanding.
(Personally I suspect that due to supply and demand limits to growth we are headed toward "planet Japan" in the near future. Fiat central banks will pump cheap money, and pump, and pump, and pump, and there will be little to no growth.)
Where the economy a piece of software, it would contain this comment:
    // TODO: HACK: Due to very rapid growth in money demand, we sort of arbitrarily increase primary money
    // every time velocity drops. This is going to cause all kinds of bubbles and other problems, but at
    // least it will keep things moving since we don't have enough memory or CPU to implement anything
    // better. Someone fix this. - Keynes

Honestly? Toss up between:
1) Governments try to make it illegal. (This wouldn't kill Bitcoin but would trash mainstream adoption and kill its value due to uncertainty.)
2) Too much interest and investment too quickly, causing an unsustainable growth rate and bubbles/crashes that destroy confidence. This could also overload the P2P network, leading to difficulties with transaction confirmation and creating pressure to centralize block chain management and thus kill Bitcoin's appealing decentralized nature.
3) Zero-day vulnerability in the mainstream client leading to a smash-and-grab riot... or worse in Bitcoin's design itself. (The latter is much less likely since a lot of big crypto brains have pronounced it secure.)
I'll toss in a  though it's a long shot:
4) Sudden appearance on the open market of a quantum computer with sufficient number of coherent qubits to run Shor's algorithm against the elliptic curve crypto used in Bitcoin.

I don't think it's anything like gold, or cash. I think it's a fundamentally new form of money. It's dangerous to overly compare it to gold or cash, since that obscures how significant an innovation it may be.
Unlike cash it cannot be inflated or deflated at a central bank's whim.
Unlike gold it cannot be *secretly* hoarded. The velocity of Bitcoin can be computed globally by anyone from the block chain. Secret hoarding and dumping of gold or other manipulations of the gold market could be used by very large players to basically accomplish the kind of manipulation that central banks can accomplish with cash.

No its not. The block chain is public information. Run a bunch of nodes that you control and sniff all IP traffic to and from those nodes. Correlate it with the block chain. Get data from ISPs on who owns those IPs. Leverage big data to mate that data with social graph information and other information from mass surveillance.
Bitcoin is *not* the privacy utopia everyone thinks it is. It's possible to use it privately, but to do so requires a far greater level of caution and technical sophistication than plain old physical cash. Simply using it naively gives you rather poor privacy.

I don't think they're a scam. They will probably eventually ship. The problem is that they've repeatedly set unrealistic deadlines and then missed those deadlines, and when you try to get more information they stonewall or misdirect. This is at the very least extremely poor customer relations. It's very unprofessional.
Any technical person knows that producing an ASIC is very, very hard. There's a million gotchas in producing a novel IC in volume-- it's why there are few algorithm-specific ASICs on the market. It's orders and orders of magnitude harder than flashing an FPGA and surrounding it with support circuitry. BFL should have been much more up-front about the fact that they were attempting a very difficult thing. It should have been presented more like a Kickstarter project and less like a project with a hard shipping deadline, and they should have been more transparent about their setbacks and where they were.

That's quite naive.
Once this deflation occurs, the miser can then come along and leverage the hoard to re-purchase businesses, capital, land, securities, etc. at the new lower prices.
Financial dirty trick denialism is a central aspect of naive libertarianism. Of course it's also present in conventional economics, since a central bank and those connected with it can do precisely the same thing by inflating and then popping bubbles.
Bitcoin doesn't prevent this, but it allows everyone to know the total float and its velocity. So people can at least infer that the hoard is out there.
