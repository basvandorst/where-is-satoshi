That was my question the entire time I was reading this.

I can't text a five digit number. How do people do that? It turns into "+1..." and nothing happens.
@_date: 2015-06-08 17:39:41
That didn't work either, and I don't know why.
@_date: 2015-06-08 17:33:29
That didn't work.

It sounds like a ridiculous libertarian crackpot idea to a lot of people when they first hear it. Many of them can't ever shake that first impression.
@_date: 2015-06-07 20:58:17
They don't call it anything, they just tell you that they can satisfy your request and how much it will be. The obvious assumption is that they are charging you more than wholesale cost.
This isn't sad. It wasn't that long ago that pretty much every working salaried professional had (or had decent access to) an assistant of some sort at home and at work. At least people middle class and up did. Technology and a changing workforce makes that much less common now, because we can all do so much more ourselves with computers and appliances, and hiring legal hourly work isn't as cheap and simple. But many of us find ourselves in a hurry and too busy now and then, and still need someone to just take care of some basic shit for us. Magic sounds like a great idea.

You'd be surprised how "mainstream" this opinion is, though. A lot of educated people believe that Bitcoin is simply a black market tool for drugs and child porn, and literally has no other possible use.
@_date: 2014-12-26 18:27:31
Buffet wasn't saying that bitcoin was bad. He just said it isn't an investment.
@_date: 2015-01-28 22:34:01
It doesn't matter much how long it is.
@_date: 2016-01-02 15:29:31
The fact that r/bitcoin has been nothing but an argument over bock sizes for quite a while now has completely turned me off from further pursuing btc.
@_date: 2016-01-31 15:23:58
I dunno, what's a satoshi with you?
@_date: 2015-01-29 12:07:07
Why should it?
Keyloggers and phishers don't give a shit how long or complex your password is. And that is the actual way accounts are compromised.
Brute forcing isn't a real threat to an Internet application. If they lock out after a few tries you can't brute force.
Seriously, long and complex password are one of the biggest security myths.

Hasn't that math changed now though? Aren't the theatrical winnings now greater than the cost of the ticket?
@_date: 2016-01-06 16:00:08
How do you not do the math here and realize that this means no one else is going to want to buy next time?
@_date: 2016-01-06 16:44:33
Nuh uh.

1) When I signed up for Uber, I clearly remember it telling me that a tip is automatically calculated and included. Is that not true anymore?
2) No, typically you shouldn't tip a service when the server already gets paid per service.
@_date: 2015-07-22 11:44:45
Still, drivers get paid for each fare. That makes tipping kind of redundant.
@_date: 2015-07-13 15:39:26
Why is this a problem? Did Greece not buy things with that money?
All they're saying now is, "all that stuff you got, you have to pay for it. If you don't have money, then barter is fine."
@_date: 2015-07-19 16:51:17
Jeez you guys are like your own private echo chamber, sock puppets.

I don't understand the $ != gold part.
@_date: 2015-07-14 19:28:58
Yeah but why would it? Yellow rock or green paper, what's the difference?
@_date: 2015-07-15 23:02:10
In this case, it was ObamaCare that roped them into a worse plan than they already had.
@_date: 2015-07-15 05:39:13
No they don't. On the contrary, I'm pretty sure most of them think gold is just something that has a nice $ value.
What is the point of being backed by gold anyway?

Food servers and haircutters are usually making an hourly wage and don't get paid to serve you. A driver, though, is already getting paid just to serve you. The tip is redundant.

* It's really hard to grasp how it all the works, even for people accustomed to being smart technologists who know everything.
* It's associated with being a lolololibertarian.
* It's something that is just new and different in such a fundamental way, like toe-shoes, that people can't help but to irrationally ridicule it. It's so easy to sound smart by being against it.

Depends on how you rate badness. But for this one, you can protect yourself pretty well just in your behavior. Something like Heartbleed you can't.
@_date: 2015-07-21 04:45:55
Ok... yes this is a rather nasty vulnerability.
However, it is in the category of "don't click on shit and don't go to bad sites." So it isn't the worst kind.
Be really wary of links (unless you're certain they link to a known reputable site). Same goes for search results. All this is true regardless of the latest vulnerability.

There's two sides to it, but you make it sound as if "Greece" is just some poor uneducated person who got roped into a risky mortgage. I assume they knew that in borrowing this money, they would need to pay it back. They needed to invest in being productive, but instead they used the money to buy votes.
The alternative would have been to force the issue up front. To refuse to loan the money unless Greece agreed top run all its legal and policy decisions through a board approval process at the EBC.
But of course, that would have created an even bigger shitstorm, a bank trying to take over a country essentially. Instead, they let Greece retain their sovereignty, and abuse the work of other nations to live in prosperity without sharing in the productivity. Now they have to pay somehow, or no one's going to ever pay.
EBC can print money, sure, but if they aren't printing it relative to the actual production of its members, then its value drops. They can print the paper, but they can't create its value.

Now you're stringing together multiple attacks, which is possible, but significantly lowers the actual likelihood.
@_date: 2015-04-06 12:14:22
incorrectly too much
@_date: 2015-04-06 03:53:00
People use "so" too much.
@_date: 2015-04-17 04:06:39
It's been this way for a while, hasn't it? Trolling bitcoin is one of the easiest ways for someone who's not too bright to seem edgy and informed and feel superior.

Starbucks licenses out their brand like crazy. For a fee, anything can claim to be Starbucks.

I still have a wallet with a satoshi in it somewhere. I need to find it.

I can confirm that large banks are seriously interested in blockchain technology. They don't care much about BTC, but blockchains could change everything.
