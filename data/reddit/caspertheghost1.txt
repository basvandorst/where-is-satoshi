Mt.Gox is dead. The company is dead. And I suspect the principals will be soon too.

Then they should have halted all operations. All. That means trading platform too. They haven't so I will say they are scamming everyone who has fiat or bitcoin there.
If they stopped trading the price wouldn't be a hundred bucks right now.

You're correct Andy. GoldmanSucks is the vampire squid of the financial world.
Those wishing for Bitcoin acceptance by the Vampire Squid better get some knowledge how those bastards work. GS is one of the  top 10 most evil companies in the world.

Yesterday, I had coinbase cancel my order  4 days after they debited my checking account and the day I was to receive my bitcoin. Of course the price went up over what I "paid' for it, which seems to be there MO. They has use of my money for 8 days and pull this crap.
I also have another order pending from Jan 1, 2014 and I expect them to pull the same crap again.
Sent Coinbase an email relpy from their cancellation email saying if the transaction is not reversed in 4 business days and I do not get my coin, I will file a complaint with the California Attorney General's office for deceitful business practices.
