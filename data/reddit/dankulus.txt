Well then excuse me, I didn't know that, probably because I don't know what a bitcoin is. But still, if it's a really high rated seller they don't want ANY negative feedback. It will really impact their sales, so to avoid that it's highly unlikely they would rip someone off for $40. It's STILL safer than mailing a person money.

No problem! I actually have no idea what a bitcoin is, but I use eBay a lot  and I've seen people sell WoW characters for thousands so I knew this had to be on there. Good luck!

Try [eBay]( it's less risky than what you have proposed, because sellers rely on their customer feedback. Also, if they rip you off, you are (almost) guaranteed to get your money back because both eBay and PayPal really protect the buyers!

I searched "bitcoin" on eBay and a bunch of listing popped up, so I informed OP of this. What's the problem? At least I added something to conversation. You're just being a dick.

So you're saying that I was wrong by implying that it is safer to buy the bitcoins on eBay than it is to mail a total stranger some money hoping he will send you bitcoins?
If that's the case, let me indulge you. eBay operates under a strict "Buyer Protection" policy in which case, said OP purchases bitcoins from eBayer seller via PayPal and does not receive his items, eBay &amp; PayPal can and will pull OP's sweet, sweet cash out of the seller's PayPal (or if necessary, personal bank) account and give OP a full refund. How do I know all this shit, you may ask? I make a living by selling stuff on eBay, so I have witnessed first hand the wrath of PayPal and eBay upon fraudulent sellers.
All OP has to do is buy the bitcoins from a seller with a high rating and at least 98% positive customer feedback and OP is guaranteed satisfaction.
