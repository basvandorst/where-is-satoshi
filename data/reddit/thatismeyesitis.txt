Also check your spam folder in your email. All my Coinbase emails were going into spam for some reason. That’s how I found out there was an issue with how clear my driving license was.

Could be a good thing. Maybe finally allow all those unconfirmed transactions get through - 
193,000 right now :O

There must be. First one that took 18 hours was only for like £10 (which I had turned into 11 Euro first) and the second one was £50 (56 Euro) took 5-6 hours. 
It took about 4 hours withdrawing from GDAX to my bitcoin address for it to come through. It’s a busy place tonight!!

When it expires, what happens? Return to the original wallet?

No the revolut payments to Coinbase were by bank transfer. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:59:04
I did two transfers from revolut to Coinbase in the last day. 
Initial one took 18 hours. 
Second transfer took 6 hours.

Oh the setting up of everything is ridiculous. Did it all over a week. Verifying with everyone. 
It’s done now though! Can buy to my hearts content!
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:00:52
It does look like its verging on getting close to getting through. I’ll maybe give it another day or so!

I’ve noticed that the iOS app has BCH above BTC now when you click on ACCOUNTS. 
What’s that about?

So, technically I could import this new paper wallet into blockchain etc, send it to a FRESH new paper wallet but put in a high fee to allow it to be confirmed?
Is there a cut off point where it's too late to do this?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:36:19
It's tanking the now! Wheeeeeee down the slide!
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:44:32
Gentlemen, there’s a solution here you aren’t seeing!
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:00:18
Thanks! :)

Just sent you 100 BTC. Did you get it?
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:47:36
Thanks for the help!
Just moved the entirety off blockchain.info onto a paper wallet. I now fully understand the process of getting the coins back off the paper wallet if I wanted to exchange it back into a fiat currency.

I actually asked this same question last week - 
I ended up moving it all to a paper wallet!
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:14:30
I'm using it more of a way of a savings account, so a paper wallet should be fine if all I'm doing is buying BTC and storing it for later use?
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:11:16
So, I should get my keys (which i can get no problem) and setup a hardware/paper wallet and transfer it to that? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:45:27
Where did you purchase your bitcoin from?
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:35:41
I shifted it on, first of all by sending £10 worth to the new paper wallet just to check that it was all going through ok.
Once I saw it appear, I then moved the rest in the one go!
Now I've been buying in various places (coinify, localbitcoins etc) and just been sending it all to the paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:10:25
Based purely on your comment, I bought another £100. Considering I only had £50 of BTC bought two months ago, I now have 3x that original amount!
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:16:42
I think this is what I'm going to do.
Will go and see about setting up a paper one...
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:13:56
This would be an issue best answered by a financial advisor.
It all depends on where you are based location wise.
You could keep a tracker for yourself which shows all your losses. A simple excel sheet could track that and that would be your backup if the IRS/Inland Revenue ever came and queried your profits/losses.
Essentially it's no different from buying cars and selling them (sometimes for a profit or a loss). You need to ask your accountant/financial adviser how to do it, or seek independent advice from the right people.

There is a good tutorial here - 
There is a 10 step tutorial here. They make reference to blockchain.info after this, but the option they are talking about no longer exists.
Once you've created your paper wallet, just go back to Blockchain.info and send some BTC to the new paper wallet address.
You can then go somewhere like bitref or blockchain.info and see the transaction going through.
