Y'all act like you never seen a BitCoin before ya
ignorance all on the floor like Satoshi and Vitalik just burst in the door
Started transacting' btc worse than before, they first get forked
Dumping her over premature,
It's the return of the "Oh wait, no way, your kidding,
He didn't just say Etherium, did he?"
And Dr Satoshi said
Nothing you idiots Dr Satoshis dead, he's locked 1m BTC in some basement (ha ha)
Economist norms love ramming em', chicka chicka chicka  Vinnik Shady I'm sick of him
Look at him, walking around grabbing his BTC what
Flippin' to you know who "yeah, but he's so norm though"
Yea I probably got a couple of doge up in my head loose
But no worse than what's going on in Jp Morgans boardroom
Sometimes I want to get on 4Chan and just let loose, but can't,
But it's cool to dump your hd like James Howells a did in 09
My BTC is on your list, my BTC is on your list
And if your lucky you might just give it a little test
And that's the encryption we deliver to little feds
And expect them not to know what a Triple DES is.
Of course they gonna know what lending is, by the time they hit 4th grade,
They got the investment channel don't they?
We charge nothing but interest,
Well some of us bankers, who lend other people debt just like wankers.
But if we can lend fiat currency and promise notes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't be scapegoats?
But if you feel like I feel I BTC's the antidote.
Keks wave your flag at shows, sing the chorus and it goes?
