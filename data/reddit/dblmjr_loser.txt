I'm not old and have a CS degree. I don't understand how cryptocurrencies are any different from fiat currency, it's all made up and the value depends on people's desire for them. I can't eat a bitcoin and I can't use it to make anything with either. Furthermore when you run out of coins to mine what's to stop everyone to just go use another currency and keep repeating this boom bust cycle?

How does decentralization answer anything? Whatever man I dgaf about your novelty money be a fucking dick I guess.

The fact that it's centralized is one aspect of fiat currency. The other is lack of backing with anything other than faith in the system, this is the same as with cryptocurrencies.
In that case then why even reply? Just to be a cunt? Fucking congratulations cunt you've made it!

That doesn't answer shit :D I don't know shit about fuck when it comes to money so to me it sounds like a non-sequitur. It's decentralized...which has nothing to do with being or not being fiat currency (unbacked and government issued) as far as I know.
Keep being a fucking cunt to a guy asking a goddamn question about the thing you supposedly want more people to use. Jesus christ the fucking neckbeard is thick as fuck round these here parts.

Backed by an algorithm? What does that mean? It's bits on hard drives dude, a bitcoin is not worth anything except what people will pay for it. It all depends on your faith in your ability to trade it later on for something, exactly like fiat currency. You can't eat bitcoins and you can't keep yourself warm with them, it's all based on faith.
The fact that it's decentralized is good, but if governments around the world decide to turn your internet off you won't be able to do shit. Are you gonna walk to the grocery store with your computer?
