Just skimming over 1.1. I am more looking for technical details, since you come from a financial background.


not instant.


From some point of view, BTC is the opposite of anonymous.


Citation needed.


Blocks are not files.


To vague, also anthropomorphizing. Maybe: Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the the last block, thus verifying it in the blockchain. It contains the transactions happening since the last block creation.


One could argue that blocks ARE Bitcoin transactions.


contains a collection of private keys.
Thats technically wrong. The BTC are stored in the blockchain. More correctly, the blockchains stores the transaction information. The wallet contains the keys necessary to issue these transaction.


Actually, the 6 blocks are just a suggestion when a transaction should be considered confirmed, as the amount of work to undo it would be increasingly high.


not logarithmically, and not with every following money transfer. I think the amount of work is increasing linear with the number of blocks.

Well, except for one argument: The Bitcoin masses (well, actually the miners, if you ask me) decide ultimately to adopt or not to adopt a specific client.
Maybe we should a bit think about situations where modifications to the client could improve the situation for some BTC participants (let's say, the miners), but impair the situation for the majority (the rest).
You might think: "The masses won't use the modified client", but I am quite sure there exist some situations where the miners could coerce the rest to use their protocol versions.
This is something I thought up just know, though.
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:52:33
Not a bad article. But it misses a point: You do not need to cash in the BTC all at once. Take 10 BTC; throw them in a tumbler or three, cash them in. Takes a while, but who wants a few Mio USD appearing in ones bank account?
That said, tumbling the BTC and then putting them back into one big wallet is just stupid - just a confirmation for the people tracking you.
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:11:29

@_date: 2013-12-04 00:03:04
Let us take a look at what the person did:
1. Throw all the coins into a tumbler
2. Throw all the coins into another tumbler
3. Put all the coins into a single wallet.
No let us analyze it. First, (1) is a bad idea. Tumblers are based on the idea that you can not tell where a Bitcoin came from, **because it could come from any person in a large number of people**. If you put 94000 coins in a tumbler, and 94100 come out, it does not matter where the coins go - you have a 99% chance that it is the target.
(2): See (1).
And by doing (3), you confirm that you are really the person they are looking for. All you did was to reduce the amount of coins you have. Congratulations, you made the owners of two tumbling services very happy.
Now, how to do it right:
1. Wait a bit, let the victims cool down a bit. The more people are looking at you, the more likely it is that some people are using serious analysis against you. Remember: Anyone can feed a support vector machine with data and take a look at the classifying results.
2. Now, split up the pot. 940 Wallets with 100 BTC are a bit harder to track, even with machines. Let us call that wallet set A.
3. Set up a bot that launders your BTC. Basically:
1. Wait random amount of (a few hours maybe?).
2. Select random nonempty wallet from set A.
3. Take random percentage &lt;20% out of this wallet and throw it into a tumbler. Do not use the same tumbler every time.
4. Distribute tumbler output over a larger number of wallets. Take good note of the wallets. This is wallet set B.
5. Repeat until all wallets from set A are empty. Repeat the same with wallet set B, just to be sure.
6. Now you can start to cash out the wallets. Slowly. Know one knows the wallets you are using have stolen BTC - at least know one can be sure. The might have suspicions for some wallets, but they can't know for sure. Nobody buys a Porsche if the just robbed a bank. Laundering money takes time.
7. Enjoy your steady income for the next 20 years. Or more.

Point is, it only claims to be provably fair (as I said).
The "client seed" does not come from the client. It comes from the server. If you were thinking on the assumption that the "client seed" is actually not known to the server *in this case*, you are wrong. I may have unintentionally worded it ambiguous, though.

Why the downvote (When I posted this, the upvote/downvote ratio was 2/7)? It is a legitimate question. Political decision processes are not necessarily driven by reason.
Probably not much at first. People in the US will seek for other ways to buy bitcoins. Paying in cash, for example. Or Paysafecards (which are, IRC, if bought with cash still relatively anonymous).
If you buy something with BTC, the business owner will find one  way or another to exclude it from his taxes.
If you sell BTC for money (let us say online), you will probably find a way to launder the "dirty BTC money". I hear buying things and selling those is a good way to do it....

While you are wrong, I will still answer. You have a random number ranging from 0 to 20. Your goal: You want to convert it into a fair dice roll, with the possible outcomes being 0,1 and 2. A possible (fair solution): 0-6: 0; 7-13:1; 14-20:2. A possible way to implement it:
Draw a number X between 0 and 20. Compute X % 3 (X modulo 3) = Y as the result. The result is fair.
What they did:
Draw a number X between 0 and 20. Compute (X divided by 8,4)= Y. Round Y to the nearest number. The result: 0-4: 0; 5-12: 1; 13-20: 2. Not fair.
What they did was probably unintentional, and does not really impact the result. But it is still not okay.

About the article: I feel that the headline is a bit misleading. If it is a bubble, you should not take it seriously, if not in a "lets get out of here" sense.
