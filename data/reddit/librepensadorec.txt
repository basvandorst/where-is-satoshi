Law is not about logics. If it is not written, it does not exist. That´s all the logic of the law. Just simple as that. 
I think you will find interesting these links:

If you are in Ecuador, I would like to invite you to the next Bitcoin event. You will be surprised. ;)

By your affirmations, I understand that you know about Ecuadorian legal system, that you have read the entire law, and of course, that you have read the full article at CoinTelegraph.
So, I assume you have enough knowledge in order to support your affirmations and answer the following questions:
 * Can you affirm that National Assembly made article 92 specifically to ban Bitcoin?
 * What is considered as "simulation of money and currency"?. Which ones are in this category?
 * Could you affirm that law does not have legalization options for Bitcoin?
 * As a curiosity about your knowledge. Could you tell us why a bank check is not considered as "simulation of money"?
Finally, the most important question:
 * Where is the word "prohibition" related to "Bitcoin" in the law?

Next time before you make an affirmation, could you first mention it is your personal opinion and the result of your own conclusions? 
Ok, I will assume you read the law, the article and you do not know about the legal system.
**About your answers and opinions:**
 * Can you affirm that National Assembly made article 98 specifically to ban Bitcoin?


You don´t know. I don´t know either. 
This Bitcoin banning effect you are talking about is the result of your personal interpretation of the law. It means it is based on your personal beliefs, values, readings, opinions, and conclusions. 
In Ecuadorian case: "The law is a statement of the sovereign will, manifested in the form prescribed by the Constitution, it commands, forbids or permits." Civil Code, Art. 1
So, you should not affirm that Bitcoin is banned, if law or regulations do not mention Bitcoin.
 * What is considered as "simulation of money and currency"?. Which ones are in this category?


Yes. Art. 98 is bigger than simulation, and of course simulation could matter for Bitcoin.
But, you didn't answered none of the two questions and it is a reason for it: There is no regulation about it, not even about how the law or the Council considers Bitcoin.
 * Could you affirm that law does not have legalization options for Bitcoin?


Yes, the Council could make Bitcoin legal by resolution.
I disagree about your conclusions about illegality of mining. Of course our commentaries are just opinions, but again law says nothing about mining. 
 * As a curiosity about your knowledge. Could you tell us why a bank check is not considered as "simulation of money"?


The law defines checks as mean of payment and that´s all. But law doesn´t talk about simulation exceptions, so you cannot affirm "they specifically define checks *outside of that category*".
But the central idea here is: **law defines it**. The same principle applies for prohibitions. (Ref. Civil Code, Art. 1)
 * Where is the word "prohibition" related to "Bitcoin" in the law?


Yes, Art. 94 is clear, as clear as Art. 14-39. ;)
You quoted Art. 98, but it doesn't mention Bitcoin. Again, is the law considering Bitcoin ilegal?. Or, is it your personal interpretation about it?
There is a risk that Bitcoin could be considered illegal based on Art. 98. I assume it is the idea you want to transmit. In that way, I agree with you, but it is different to affirm "Bitcoin is banned in Ecuador".
In fact, the law gives the Council legal attributions to make Bitcoin legal or illegal. I don´t know a legal system that allows people define prohibition or legality. It is the law and regulation those who determine prohibition. I assumed that you don´t know about our legal system so here are some clues:
  1. Ecuadorian Legal system comes from Civil Law specifically the Latin-Roman system. Codes and statutes are the main source of law and are designed to cover all eventualities.
  2. Judges are interpreters of the law and, compared with Common Law system, our judges have a more limited role applying the law. In our system every norm should be written.
  3. Legislative branch creates the law, and institutions appointed in the law create complementary norm through its regulation attributions.
  4. The law is a statement of the sovereign will, manifested in the form prescribed by the Constitution, it commands, forbids or permits.
In conclusion, Monetary Council is the entity designed by Monetary Code to create regulation in that matter. The Council can easily ban Bitcoin because they have the legal attributions to do it. But until today, I cannot affirm that Bitcoin is permited in Ecuador, in the same way you should not affirm that Bitcoin is banned in Ecuador. 
If you are willing to affirm the "banning of bitcoin in Ecuador", please wait for a law or resolution related to Bitcoin. Otherwise you are free to express your opinions, but please do not make a speculative assertion without mention that it is your personal opinion. 
Law has its own mechanisms.
