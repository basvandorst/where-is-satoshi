Except iOS has significantly better security than Android. Android is basically just a Google datamining operation. You pay more for Apple, but at least you're not milked for data

I think this sentiment needs to spill over into Ethereum space... For the first time we have a high level language for processing payments and declaring ownership. It *should* be used as a backend solution. Want implement a payment protocols for a specific niche? Write it in Solidity in one tenth of the time it takes to write it in a common stack. Don't even tell anyone its on the blockchain.
I really do like the Linux analogy. It allows us to think about creating *real* value on the blockchain. Instead of pump and dump coin transfers

I agree that Bitcoin is useful, but it's not the only useful crypto. In no particular order of importance:
- Bitcoin: Store of value, transactions (if scaling issues are resolved)
- Ethereum: Smart contracts, Whisper protocol, Swarm decentralized storage etc...
- Monero: Privacy sensitive stuff
There are many usages of blockchains beyond digital currencies. Currently, most of those are incentivised by tokens. And all are growing :)

Well I wouldn't say it's a key difference between BitCoin and _Ethereum_. It's a key difference between Bitcoin and _Ether_ . And ether was never meant as a currency or a store of value. For a store of value look at stablecoins (where the market is incentivised to keep the value of the token as stable as possible) such as the MakerDAO
