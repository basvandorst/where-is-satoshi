You did nothing wrong. Those two should leave the foundation, and I am glad that you put yourself in front of it and was the only one who says what everyone thought.
They can't have this kind of blatant lack of responsibility and oversight (yes oversight over your own members: Mark K, Charlie Shrem) and get away with doing nothing.
Thanks TBI for your efforts!

750k + 200 that we have seen moving around online seems to add up.
Can I mention that this database does not reflect the blockchain at all? The balances aren't linked, and unless we see the actual wallet addresses (which are not included for whatever reason) we should assume nothing.

200k is the equivalent of what was moving in the hot wallet yesterday..

The database might say it has 951k but the blockchain might say something very different. Also no addresses were supplied so. Until that happens this is FUD.

I confirm this!

This is me.

Seems legit. Some files don't add anything for the users here and only inflate its size (like the public transactions in the root folder).
Dear MagicalTux, can we please get the actual wallet-addresses so we can verify if what the database says is still there on the blockchain?

Keep in mind that the cold wallet for mtgox was never cold. Andreas or gmaxwell pointed this out by quoting Mark K saying he would proxy to his cold wallet and issue a transfer (remotely) from his home.

He did not pose, the picture was probably online already or given by his friends/children unbeknownst it would be used like this.
