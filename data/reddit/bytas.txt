Making statements like you just did is the best way to undermine bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is a consensus network, if it can't handle someone  making a fork it has missed the entire purpose of a decentralised currency. Everyone should be allowed to make a fork. Me, you, your dog, obama, isis, mcdonalds, coca cola, aliens, ... 
No one is forced to run it. If the fork os shit, you have nothing to worry about, no one will run it, if people run it it was the better option.

If you lose hope and get depressed because prices are low, you shouldn't be involved in bitcoin. The price is irrelevant, look around you, lose yourself in the wonder of a growing and free economic system and enjoy every bump and plot twist it comes with. See the value of the network grow day by day and know that value will stick around longer than any unrealistic "to the moon" bubble could ever do. 
Stop checking the price every 5 seconds and get out of your little bubble of helplessness. Now is the time to grasp opportunity and help grow this economy, now is the time to get your good idea and start that startup. Every insignificant little step towards providing a wanted service you take right now will be magnified a thousandfold and be transformed into a majestic leap over the comming years, as the rest of the world starts to recognize the solutions this new technology can offer.
Wake up, this is the best time of our life.

I'm only saying bitcoin ensures they can't just take your savings if they feel they want to tax you.  
my problem is not with the tax itself, but with the way it was implemented. 
It is much harder to complain about something that was taken from you without consent than it is to abject BEFORE it is taken.  
Some people here say it's pointless to argue about it, ( no choice vs illusion of choice) as the end result will be the same: you paying your taxes. 
I'd like to think differently about that. The fact that we pay our taxes instead of them being taken from us leaves the active decision to do so with the population and not with the government themselves. Once taxes are being automatically payed and the population no longer has the initiative, the power to object is effectively broken. 
It's about the division of power really: government makes rules, law applies them and police enpowers them. Automatic taxation gives governments the ability to make the rules AND apply them, avoiding the legal system. 
I'm fine (to some extend) with a system where the government tells me to pay taxes and suing me if i don't, but i'm not fine with a system where the government takes my money and i have to sue them if i disagree with their decision after it already happened. I don't think it's hard to see the important nuance between the two.

BTC, just BTC. Why would bitcoin need an ISO code? it's Bitcoin for gods sake, it'll change the world. XBT only makes bitcoin more confusing. If you want to understand bitcoin as a newby, the last thing you need is to worry about "Why does it have an X in front? Bitcoin has no X in it." 
Oh, and don't say it needs to be X because of ISO, 80% of the world doesn't care about ISO :P

I went to the boulevard on 16 april and the situation was as follows: 
Eethuis de zon: accepting and enthousiastic
M restaurant: one of the most involved 
De pakschuit: Couldn't accept because 'their bitcoin account was broken'. :p
El Barrio: didn't accept and considered the project a failure 
7 O clock: Didn't accept because it was too hard
Eten bij werelds: accepted and thought it was a very nice idea!
Rembrand: wanted to get rid of it but allowed me to buy one pint anyway because i came all the way from belgium. 
What made them change their mind? 
Over all the organizers could have done a MUCH better job at explaining the shop keepers what they were getting into. 
First of all: Don't let people accept bitcoin with only a QR code printed on paper and no way to check if the bit coins arrived.... who does that? All the café's with electronic tools loved bitcoin, all the café's without complained the system didn't work (no shit, if you can't check if your customer paid) 
and second and maybe most important: Why didn't you guys tell them about bitpay or other ways to instantly convert their bitcoins to fiat? I wouldn't be very happy if i sell a coffee for 2 euros and 2 weeks later its only worth 1 euro. 
Lets be honest here, most business owners don't want to get involved in speculation. 
Besides all the little annoyances, still a nice project though.

All those bitcoinATM's arn't going to magically disappear when bitcoin drops in price, neither will overstock, paypal or dish (you guessed it: the exchangerate is 100% irrelevant for them to accept the currency). 
projects like Storj and ethereum arn't going to stop existing either. 
There are three certainties we have: 1. if Bitcoin crashes completely (as in becomes unuseable) , it will be because there is a flaw in the mathematics behind it, not speculation. 2. The price of bitcoin will be absolutely zero, squad, nada if that happens. 3. Alternative coins based on the same technology will fill the gap in the market faster than you can say "cryptocurrency". 
This is why people need to stop pinning their whole mindset on the price while watching as a helpless passenger and basically being scared 24/7.
A good cryptocurrency startup is one which isn't reliant on the price of the currency it uses, and can switch to using another currency with minor tweeks, which is pretty much standard due to 95% shared DNA/code between most currencies. 
Ask yourself: "Would i contemplate suicide if bitcoin has a value of $0.00 tomorrow?" If no: good you have nothing to fear, If yes: Either get out now, bitcoin is not worth your life, or start building safeguards to reduce the impact of the mesmerizing price ticker on you mental health, such as the right kind of startups, a diversified curriculum or a deeper understanding of the technology behind bitcoin (being scared of something is mostly due to a lack of understanding of the subject)

Almost every single Bitcoin that is accepted by any big merchant on the planet is instantly converted to Fiat Currency, which means it's dumped on the market and sold at a price low enough to make the sale instant. At the  moment, bitcoin is 'bleeding' because early adopters or miners are buying some stuff with their coins where they used to hold before. 
It's a growing pain we have to go trough, think about the dropping price as a necessary sacrefice to make the bitcoin economy grow. Things will change once the early adopters got their goods and people actually start buying bitcoin to buy stuff because it makes paying easier, and not as an investment.

This is actually a delusional way to look at it.  
the number of GH/s is NOT a correct measure for the decentralization of the network.
20 000 000 gigahashes just joined the network in about 24 hours. Do you honnestly believe that was the result of a whole bunch of individuals setting up a small miner, thus increasing the safety of the network? 
No, quite clearly, some big player decided he wanted to throw a couple of millions at it and made a big miningfarm, centralizing power into the hands of a few. 
If you think ASICS make the bitcoin network safer, think again. It's the increase in number of USERS that does. If honnest people can invest in ASICS, so can mallicious people, asics on their own contribute nothing to the safety of the network, they are just a sideffect of the much needed incentive (block reward) and the race to get it first. 
That being said, the network is much stronger than a few years ago, but only because the network is growing, not because of asics.

Hate to disappoint you. 
ASIC stands for "Application Specific Integrated Circuit" 
While CPU's have different types of calculations they can do, ASICS are just a bunch of parallel lines that take a bit of data and do the same calculation on it in a linear fashion every time. 
Compare it to roadways if you will. A CPU is a city where you can drive at 20Mph and reach a million different destinations. An ASIC is a highway with 20 lanes where you can drive at 120Mph but can only go to one destination: the end of the highway. 
ASICs arn't even computers. They are dumb pieces of electronics that do the same thing really quickly over and over while drooling all over themselves and frantically shouting 'hodor! hodor!'

I'm a bit disappointed about this video actually. 
I live in Belgium and made a trip to The Hague to buy something in every café of the bitcoin boulevard, so i had a chat with every single café/resto owner that was involved. 
It's a missed opportunity that NONE of them were interviewed to talk about their experiences. Some of them were really enthusiastic, some of them hated it, 7 o'clock didn't even take bitcoin anymore when i went there, along with 3 other shops. The ones that did still take bitcoin were up in the clouds about it and wanted to push the concept further. 
It's a shame how only those two dudes that set up the project were interviewed, and not the actual shop owners themselves.

You pay the store, they hold off the 21% and pay it to the government later, the tax is still paid, not taken. You still do the purchase and the government does not have access to your bank account during this time. 
In the case where the government has all the power they just tap into your bankaccount, monitor what you buy and take whatever they see as the correct tax whenever they want.
