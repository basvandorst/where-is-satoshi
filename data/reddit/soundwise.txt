Oh god, I spent all this time trying to give you advice and ***you are a fucking psychopath***.
I've lost all desire to participate here except to tell you that you are incompetent and don't even have the cunning of a psychopath. You make a terrible remorseless calculating robot. If you can't even do that you aren't even human. Attacking your ego is literally the only way to make you feel anything if you're a psychopath. 
I am holding out for you though and hoping you actually do have empathy and are just hyper-rationalizing yourself here to such an extreme degree to sounding like a lying, manipulative psychopath. Stop it.

It can be done responsibly though (like any form of gambling). OP literally followed absolutely 0 of the fucking rules. 
The VERY FIRST TWO rules could probably be summed up as:
A) Do not position yourself entirely on a single commodity or security.  ^(*Please note that it is assumed that this only includes your money, breaking this rule is stupid, but if you are breaking this rule with someone else's money you are out to fucking lunch)
B) Have reasonable buy and sell limits. It is expected that you will sometimes have positions that result in a loss. None of those losses should ever put you in any sort of desperation. 
OP did the exact opposite, and even went above and beyond to break them.

You NEED to read your own words:


SHE IS GOING TO SAY THE SAME FUCKING THING ABOUT YOU IN A FEW YEARS. Either you are a sociopath and are incapable of feeling what you'd feel in her position or you need to get a hold of the situation. 
You're a classic fuck up. I mean that. You are a walking cliche story about how you can never trust someone under 30 with large sums of money. Take some of the money you have now, give it to her and walk the fuck away and piss away the rest like you're going to anyway. This is the only way you're going to redeem yourself and feel like you aren't a complete mess-up. 
As for actual **investment** advice: what the fuck are you doing talking about arbitrage and then getting all hot and bothered by the 800.00 figure? That is completely horrendous investment philosophy. Also, if you are playing volatility, no number should make you start wanting to dump huge amounts of money into it that you can't afford to lose. No more advice because continuing to read your post makes me angry. You should have hired a financial adviser from day 0 (edit: looks like you did and then rejected their advice, holy shit there is no helping some people).

Percentage-wise though, that million probably isn't anywhere close to more than half their entire capital like it was for OP.

And gambling can be done responsibly. With day trading you're supposed to have a limit you sell at to minimize losses and move on from a position. OP literally, or as literally as you can get in terms of calling this gambling, bet it all on black with his sisters money.

It would be fair because of this:


You are misleading her. She trusts you and thinks you're doing ok.

**PLEASE DO THIS**


It's the right thing to do.

Doesn't matter that they  don't get it.
 
If they did "get it," guess what would happen? They would tell you to put money in it only as part of a diversified portfolio and none of this would matter anyway because not even an investor who "gets" bitcoin would ever tell you to invest in it completely.
