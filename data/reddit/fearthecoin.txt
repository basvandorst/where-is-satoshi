My guess is he's referring to non-bitcoin-core offshoots of bitcoin.

I think it varies by location. Try their site:

Agreed. It's a cool idea but it seems very vulnerable to theft.

On an exchange (Bitfinex, Bitstamp, etc.) or OTC (itBit, Cumberland, etc.).

The way the approval process works, there is a hard deadline on March 11th. By law the SEC can't delay it beyond that.

To invest directly in the BIT, you need to be wealthy. But BIT shares can be converted to GBTC after a year. Anyone can trade GBTC, wealthy or not.

Probably until the next time they mine a block. They have 8% of the hashrate, so that would be in very roughly two hours.
Edit: It's a moot point since I see they just confirmed your transaction!
@_date: 2017-02-01 22:33:53
Seconded, this has helped me out a few times.
@_date: 2017-02-06 13:33:04
You can convert BTC to money in your bank account same-day with OTC trading. However there is a minimum size of $25,000 or 25 BTC depending on who you use (itBit, Cumberland, etc.).

Roughly what quantity?

Maintaining a relationship with a bank is probably the  biggest issue for bitcoin companies today. That's why you see companies like Coinbase making their onboarding processes more rigorous than opening a bank account. 
Good luck.

@_date: 2017-02-01 20:07:54
Roughly how many BTC? OTC is an option for amounts above 25 BTC / $25,000.
@_date: 2017-03-06 00:09:23
Bitmex has a history of changing contract specs in the middle of trading. I guarantee you if no SEC news has come out before march 12th, the contract won't settle until after march 13th. Don't trade based on the current contract specs!

They sell it on the exchanges.

If I withdraw $50,000 from my Gemini account by wire, I get $50,000 in my bank account less any fees my bank charges. Gemini itself doesn't charge any fees. In my experience it's the only exchange that doesn't charge for wire withdrawals.
@_date: 2017-01-25 15:42:37
The biggest headwind for day trading is trading fees. Luckily for you, you're in the UK and [Coinfloor]( doesn't charge for trading! (They make their money from the GBP withdrawals and deposits.)
@_date: 2017-01-25 19:01:09
itBit used to publish [monthly updates]( They were trading tens of thousands of BTC per month. And Cumberland [just announced]( they bought 69,800 BTC from auctions. They're probably selling those to someone else. 
Which mining farms say they aren't selling?
@_date: 2017-01-25 18:54:00
That's what OTC trading is for. The OTC desks I'm aware of have a minimum of 25 BTC or $25,000 but no maximum!
@_date: 2017-01-25 19:14:47
I was assuming government auctions, like the 27,000 they won from the US Marshals in 2015. 
But it isn't really clear. Gemini is doing daily auctions too, so maybe Cumberland is counting that too?

Update, KNC mined a new block an hour ago:

Currently if you want to own bitcoin you have to store it, or you own a crappy kinda-like-bitcoin-but-not-really thingamajig like GBTC. Hedge funds probably aren't used to storing cryptocurrency and are scared by that. But that won't be true forever!
@_date: 2017-01-22 16:15:03
Coinfloor is an example. Just last week they announced zero-fee trading. They charge .35% or so on fiat withdrawals and deposits to make up the revenue shortfall. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 19:23:27
If you're John Q Hedgie, you can draw bitcoins from OTC trading, Gemini auctions, plus the exchanges. So the opportunity is out there. Certainly it's way easier today to get size done than it was a few years ago.
@_date: 2017-01-30 17:20:20
In my experience they are not a scam. Have you tried contacting their support?
@_date: 2017-01-25 15:35:59
Any idea where that data is coming from? Interesting indeed.
@_date: 2017-01-24 14:24:33
Very roughly what size? Above 25 BTC / $25k you could look into OTC trading.
@_date: 2017-01-23 22:24:20
Coinmama is legit and has been around for years. They accept credit cards.
@_date: 2017-01-23 22:28:19
They're legit. They send wire transfers very quickly and don't charge a fee for it. Also the Winklevoss brothers (they own the exchange and they're also behind the COIN ETF application) are two of the biggest bitcoin backers.
The BTC-USD market is fairly liquid but the ETH markets are less so.
@_date: 2017-01-16 19:47:03
The withdrawal fee is .0005 BTC, not .005. Otherwise looks like your math is right.
@_date: 2017-01-26 17:59:03
can you explain this a bit more? why do you trust breadwallet so much? (I trust it as well but I'd like some more background on specifically why you like it.)
@_date: 2017-01-09 13:01:40
I don't think Gemini offers GBP. Your best bet would probably be [Coinfloor]( which [Bitcoinity]( shows as the most active BTC-GBP exchange.
@_date: 2017-01-24 12:54:47
my guess would be they don't support any americans actually. maybe try asking their support?

* late 2015: Cyprus, ETH launched, big run-up from 200 to 500.
* early 2016: Mike Hearn declared bitcoin a failed experiment.
* mid 2016: price rose to 790 pre-halvening, then came back down.
* July 2016: halvening! block reward is now 12.5 BTC
* August 2016: Bitfinex lost 120,000 BTC to a hacker, haircut everyone 36% of all balances, gave everyone BFX tokens in exchange for the debt. (BFX tokens are now trading $.67 on the dollar, not bad.)
* late 2016: price rise
* early jan 2017: price continued to rise to 1170 or so, china-led. then price came off sharply, china-led. in the last week the big three chinese exchanges banned margin trading and instituted fees of .2% (up from 0%).

Bitfinex offers ETH borrowing, as well as BTC, ETC, LTC, USD, and BFX tokens.

Kraken has the most liquid BTC-EUR book by far. 
@_date: 2017-04-05 21:35:42
Venmo transactions are easy to reverse so it will be hard to find someone to do this trade with you.
@_date: 2016-02-24 21:43:23
I think CoinMama fits your needs. It will be a bit pricier than the other options I've seen mentioned though. 
@_date: 2017-04-05 21:36:59
If you're doing $25k+ you could try asking the OTC desks, itBit and Cumberland.
@_date: 2017-04-04 21:14:06
Excellent summary. Just to add a different category to this, OTC traders are good for doing large size without hassle. **itBit** and **Cumberland Mining** are the go-to places for that. **Downside:** OTC traders generally only deal in wire transfers. Also the minimum size is larger (think 25 BTC or $25,000).
@_date: 2017-04-06 12:37:36
Very helpful response to OP, thanks.
Tangentially, is Cottonwood trading with OTC desks? Seems like a good fit, though it would also be possible to route those orders 100% through the exchanges.
@_date: 2017-04-13 13:32:49
I know relatively un-tech-savvy people who regularly visit bitcoin.com and print out articles. A popup like this is only going to confuse them.
@_date: 2017-04-19 18:47:35
OTC is good for this (same-day settlement) if you meet the minimum size (usually around $25k). Cumberland and itBit are the two I'd suggest.

if you're on core v 0.13, I think you can just right-click the transaction in the Transactions window, and click "remove" or something similar.

Try Coinmama? They accept credit cards, though not sure if AMEX is included.
@_date: 2016-05-03 15:28:47
never heard of bitcoin ranger but in my personal experience wesellcrypto is a good site for paypal/btc.
@_date: 2017-07-24 01:37:34
You could try asking the big OTC traders: itBit, Cumberland Mining, etc. The minimum size will be $50-100k I believe, but if you're doing millions of dollars worth that shouldn't be an issue.
@_date: 2016-07-19 22:33:02
To be fair, some phone wallets are actually pretty good (ex: Breadwallet). Exchanges are certainly a dangerous place though!

Naw. If you don't move your coins for a while after the fork and you do your homework before moving anything, you'll be fine. Having the private keys at the time of the fork is the most important thing, since then you are in complete control of your coins on all forks.
@_date: 2016-07-01 21:23:52
Coinfloor is the most liquid BTC-GBP exchange. You can buy small amounts via a broker or large amounts directly on the exchange.
