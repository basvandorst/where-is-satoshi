For those still wondering whether to buy in I really recommend buying pocket change every now and then. I've started to put 10% of my monthly savings into Bitcoin instead of in the savings account, it doesn't break the bank and I won't be too upset if the price falls out of the sky. I reckon I'll thank myself in a few years as those small purchases will really add up.
You can't go wrong with a hardware wallet to store it on, the ledger HW.1 is only €16 and will keep it all safe for future self.

Hardware wallets are one of the safest ways. Test the waters with the Ledger Wallet HW.1, it's only €18. The Trezor would be my wallet of choice at the moment.

Regular people aren't going to spot a dip or be able to get in quick enough, little amounts regularly is easy if you plan on holding long term.
@_date: 2017-02-24 23:06:59
The HW.1 is only €18, I'd take that over a paper wallet all day long.

Every time I get paid I put my remaining bank account balance into the savings account, I've started spending 10% of that on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:43:05
Can you explain this in layman's terms please?
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:15:57
They've been doing it for years. Walk into a Bank and ask to set up a business account to sell Bitcoin through. Then come back and tell us your results.
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:17:28
Have you ever tried opening a business account for a Bitcoin trading business? You'll not have any joy.
@_date: 2017-03-11 07:40:59
You must be selling a lot for the price to plummet.

Part of the problem might have singing to do with multiple replies to single tickets.

Why don't you sign up and get approved for bank transfer on one of the sites? Bittylicious and Bitbargain are almost at BitStamp rates on occasion. 
Both sites offer Paym and Pingit but are generally higher than bank transfer. 
@_date: 2017-01-16 12:01:08
I'll be sending USD to BitStamp in future. That's a lot cheaper than my bank, it cost £20 for a SEPA.

I've been interested in Bitcoin for a few years and watched rises and falls closely, I still got caught up in the excitement and bought 0.25 at $1100ish, you'll never pick the best time to buy, those who do are lucky most of the time.
Stick it in a paper wallet and forget about it, you'll be very glad before long.
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:36:03
I bought 0.25 this morning, my first purchase in a couple of years.
@_date: 2017-01-26 15:15:05
Definitely. The Ledger Wallet HW.1 is a great starting point IMO, it hasn't got a screen so you need to set it up on an air gapped USB boot drive, they have easy to follow instructions on their site. It only costs €18, they are so cheap I bought some for others, my brother was really happy to sit down and learn how to use it.

After thinking about it, my best guess is that the articles I read on the could be the majority of the data.
@_date: 2017-01-13 02:48:29
If you lose a hardware wallet, buy a new one and use your recovery seed, will you be able to move coins without the PIN/Passphrase?
@_date: 2017-01-17 00:52:47
I'd rather not sit there waiting an age for an order to fill. I would just like a quick in and out trade so I'm exposed to less risk.
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:05:19
Bitbargain or bittylicious have been around a long time.
@_date: 2017-01-17 04:28:14
You're correct, my plan was to put a lower buy order an let it come to me, then sell on the bounce. 
You can't do it if there is no liquidity though. Check out the GBP/BTC book and let me know how I could possibly get my GBP to USD without losing hundreds?
The only thing it could be good for is withdrawing to fiat, you could pick up an extra few £/BTC the send GBP to your bank and not incur currency exchange cost.
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:54:25
No idea, I'd say I definitely check it far too often but I'd be interested to see how much data others are burning through.
@_date: 2017-01-16 14:23:16
Selling is a different matter, there are plenty of buy orders sitting a few £ over USD rate as you described.
Sell orders are still £30 above current buy orders. 
Right now 24 hour volume is 13.32btc
If you wanted to buy £5k worth you'd be paying £740+ for your last few coins when the USD rate is £687.23.
I think Kraken could easily make people aware that there is no liquidity in their GBP market and that it might be better to send USD or EUR.
@_date: 2017-01-17 07:13:35
Exactly my point. I had hoped that Kraken might have been able to do a simple GBP/USD trade, but their only advice was to buy GBP then sell for USD. I didn't work it out but it was a silly idea, luckily I don't go to them for financial advice.
@_date: 2017-01-05 19:42:44
You're taking like we couldn't have a bounce any minute. It's all good fun, up or down it gets people interested.
@_date: 2017-05-21 07:01:53
If you're desperate for money and can't eat. I'd sell. Otherwise hold it, and keep adding to it.
I buy small little scraps often and out them in a wallet, best savings account going. Your future self will thank you.
@_date: 2017-05-09 18:20:58
Actually it's a perfect carriage of perfect book keeping.
@_date: 2017-05-15 13:21:55
Mystery solved. Good day.
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:02:30
If history had taught me anything, do not sell.
