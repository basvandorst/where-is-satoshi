haha yeah, can't wait to get my 1099's this year.  :(

I'm not an expert on this, but that seems like longer than it should be.  Usually mine are done in under an hour or 2?

I hear you man, I have 300 bucks worth stuck in Valhala since august.

I remember freaking out after weathering my first dip, HODL strong everybody

I don't send my bitcoin around much, but don't think I ever paid more than 6 or 7 usd.  Was usually sending from coinbase if that makes a difference.  BTC really needs to get their shit together and get the lightning network activated.  These types of things are fine if your sending thousands of dollars and can wait, but it's annoying as hell for smaller transactions.

hahaha thanks for that

it OBVIOUSLY is the most refreshing.  the Core shills &amp; Bcash propagandists are just spreading FUD

gotta diversify your bonds n***a
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:42:57
They were definitely trading higher than that on HitBTC.  I snagged a few around 1200, last week, saw them go +2k and got really excited, then watched my gainz  slowly disappear until today.  Should have listened to my heart and taken the gain back into good ole BTC

WHAT 9000 
@_date: 2017-09-20 18:02:56
nice, i'll download once it hits iphone
@_date: 2017-09-05 18:22:16
certainly seems plausible.  I wouldn't expect anything less from them. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:53:22
she have an Instagram/website?  I'll check it out
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:35:40
As much as I agree, people having it will eventually work it's way into people wanting to spend it as a currency.  I bought a bunch mostly as an investment but now I have a bunch that I would like to be able to use as an actual  currency
@_date: 2017-10-18 00:13:33
yeah, I feel that.  I'm not going to be broke if they crash but it would hurt... alot.  Don't invest what you can't afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-09-06 18:06:56
I'm guessing you can, but I would be weary of your tax liability.  I believe coinbase will issue a 1099 to you at some point, but i'm not really sure how it would work if you just tranfer your coins out then sell on a different exchange.  Wondering if they would also issue a 1099, but not know what you paid for them, which would raise a bunch of awkward questions from the IRS at some point.  If anybody knows more about this I'd love to know.

think I read that it's going to open up on 1/1/18.  
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:30:10
haha remember when it was declared dead little over a month ago?  Was picking em up for under 4k *makes it rain*
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:02:34
They were @ 4k roughly a month ago, but are currently trading at 5765.  There was a big dip around the news that China was banning something and that Chase guy said some not so nice things.  You don't need any specific amount of money to invest though, you can buy very small fractions of any of the crypto currencies.  I started buying December/January last year when they were trading around 900 with whatever I had leftover at the end of the month.  I got started using Coinbase and they've been good to me, however you'll want to read up on hard forks and the downside to keeping your coin there when there is a hardfork.  Just like any investment, don't invest what you can't afford to lose.  Cryptos are VERY volatile, and while I and many others have been doing really well that gravy train may come to a crashing halt at any minute.   Feel free to PM me if you have any specific questions, I'm always willing to procrastinate on my real work.

agreed, I did this around the time winklevoss etf got shut down with some solid success
