I can confirm that the feature is not currently working as it should. To me it gives 2 different images when refreshing the page from the same IP. Thanks for informing, will put this forward.
edit: It is fixed now, thanks for informing!

If you notice abusive behaviour like locking coins, please report them to localbitcoins support. 
They should be quite quick to notice whether the activity is actually intentionally malicious, or just ignorance, and therefore they can help you unlock your coins.

Hi, I am from Localbitcoins.  
I am extremely sorry for your bad experience. I hope we could have provided better and more specific support with this case.  
Obviously I am not able to share any details here, but please keep in mind that these cases can be legally way more complex than they initially look like. Also if the case is very old, it can be difficult to keep up with the case which is outside of typical support processes.  
I have sincere hope that solution to this case can be found.

I just want to point out that USD is not the only currency traded on localbitcoins. For example, this RUB chart is somehow even more interesting considering the global development of the currency.

As an avid Dota2 fan, I am really interested to see this happen! I work @ Localbitcoins, and while I cannot promise that we are able to sponsor this event, I am definitely trying to convince my boss to do so. Hell, I might even invest some from my own pocket, just to make it reality!

Call me naive, but I call bullshit on this kind of warnings. While it is clear that any device you connect to internet and install apps should not be considered "safe", you should always take into account how likely is that your bitcoins will be stolen because of this certain technical vulnerability number 
While similar kind of vulnerabilities to the presented one are published on weekly basis, I have never heard that anyone has ever gotten hacked because of that kind of vulnerability. It is way more likely that you will lose your bitcoins due to:
1. Personal random mistake (Oops, sent my bitcoins to a wrong address)
2. Social engineering attack (Hi, you are so cute, can I take a selfie with your phone and then send it to my whatsapp while installing this stealpasswords.apk to your device?)
3. Brute force attack. (I keep hitting you with this wrench until I get the pin code to your phone and wallet)
tl;dr: You should always focus on preventing the most likely security vulnerability.

You forget that the best indicator of success is the amount of haters.
"This is actually good for bitcoin!"

The site is back up, and everything should work normally now. If you encounter any problems, please tell about them to support.

I would not try to do it with an one piece, just due to obvious risks. Perhaps try various different sources, and ensure that your processes from exchange to cold wallet or multisig wallet are working without a stress.
One quite interesting way to do it would be actually setting up Localbitcoins.com "Sell your bitcoins to me"-advertisement with somewhat competitive pricing but still under the market price. Being the buyer with the trades, the risk is zero and probabilities that you will get cheap bitcoins is quite high. That approach would also allow you to scale the purchases up little by little.

Sorry for the confusion. For some reason e-mails you were sending me were not threaded properly, which affected lots of confusion by my side. Also, I got wrong information regarding your successful login.
You are correct that there are lots of improvements to be done with the support handling. Our focus have been lately in new features and infrastructure, and with limited resources it can be difficult to find the right balance.
However, thank you for the accurate and corrective feedback, and my apologies for all the hassle you needed to go through. Thanks to your feedback, we now managed to find serious bug (logging with e-mail address does not work with 2FA), and we can guide other customers better and fix the bug eventually.

Actually you need additional max in the middle of the formula: max(max(mtgoxUSD,cbxUSD)*1.06),100)

Please note that there are plenty of 3rd party implementations of google authenticator app, so smartphone is not necessarily required. 
We have been trying to figure out alternative 2FA-methods, but most of the options are either pretty geeky (Ubikey, GPG-signing) or unreliable (sms). If you have some knowledge, you should be able to set google authenticator running on some other platform anyway. However, all suggestions and tips how to solve this problem are appreciated.
@_date: 2013-09-13 13:27:21
The programming fault which allowed this have been fixed already. Also, all users who have enabled 2FA have been reimbursed, and rest of them have been informed how to get reimbursement.

Hi, I'm from localbitcoins. Have you sent a support ticket regarding this? If so, can you possibly provide the ticket number as PM? This sounds like a bug.
