I would imagine someone in the treasury department was given task to hold these coins for the various agencies/offices, and is following what they feel to be proper security, moving coins...

Why would they charge it in ny in the federal  court?

Accurate based on the information you have been provided? You believe everything the gov tells you. Or just things  about 29 yearolds drug lords?

Why wouldnt the feds take their shot at a capital conspiracy crime 
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:20:51
He means the feda in their orignal release to the press included familiar but far fetched stories of ukbricht hiring hitmen.  They have never pressex charges regarding these alleged activities. If they can pin being dpr on him. How can they not pin those charges?

As a fellow human being. I just want you to know that douchebags like you are the laughingstock of most human beings. Starting this thread is deplorable. If you are one of the sheep who read a guardian blog about this subreddit and joined it recently, then you would think that the majority of the bitcoin community are speculative traders, simply not true. 
And lol at anything being real currency. All currency is a concept you doofus.

That is up to your organization's willingness to learn from mistakes other exchanges have made and got spanked for. It seems to most I talk to, as long as exchange houses keep up with various regs the Gov't is sure to tack on in the coming 15 months to Bitcoin, all while keeping their financial books vaguely transparent, a viable american exchange partnering with credit unions or some other established fin org is possible.
