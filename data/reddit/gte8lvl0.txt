Would love to cross to my sub if that's ok. I feel like I want this on a plaque in my home.

I think this is one of the most important things that has happened to crypto lately. The power of an organically vigilant and self policing community being the checks and balances for the service providers is, at the minimum, circumstancial evidence that the status quo can be replaced with a working system.

Much appreciated. One day I'm going to use this as the analogy for how humanity functioned as a blockchain since the dawn of civilization.

I'm happy, but not surprised. This is what happens when you decentralize. Satoshi spoke of it. The old system will try and use its tricks on the new, but they can't work. That was a system based on secrets, lies and corruption. This is a system based on privacy , transparency and as it clearly shows, accountability.

You put Jesus Christ on the same sentence you call others deluded. Does anyone know, is this ironic, oximoronic or just foolish trolling?

First and foremost. Good. Let each and everyone of those monsters suffer till the day they die. 
With that said, the article seems to be creating a narrative that demonizes the "dark web" and bitcoin. [Hackers]( had already infiltrated the site which is more likely what the feds did. The blockchain was used to show with absolute certainty which individuals where conducting transactions, but is not how they got caught.
If anything, this is a positive point for Bitcoin, but without getting too r/conspiracy about it, I sincerely think this bust feels like a consolation prize after the bullshit we just witnessed with Jeffrey Epstein, but that's just my humble opinion.

This is the best advice I can give from my very limited perspective.Do not look at crypto as a moneymaking cure all. It will continuously be presented that way, and it has the potential to be that, but not in the current situation/reality of our world. With that said, invest only what you can afford to burn and only play daytraiding with a small part of that. Your portfolio should be dedicated to HODL as a safe, long term investment.
I like to think of Bitcoin as a motorcycle. A rider starts making mistakes and being careless on a bike the moment they lose fear and respect for it. Now imagine motorcycles have never existed in this reality and someone just told you  you can buy a prototype. Except this prototype is an electric, hoverbike that uses truth for fuel and emits creativity/opportunity as exhaust.

Cool, just making sure you weren't a cop lol.

If it works, would you at least credit me at some point? Lol.

Well, Bitcoin and Blockchain tech are phenomenal tools to show that honest, true value systems CAN be sustainable, and it's happening in the internet. Change is coming, and I love that we can be a part of it.

Not with THAT attitude lol, however I'm not talking about price hikes, that may or may not be a byproduct. 
Was simply sitting here trying to come up with new ways to use the technology in a positive disruptive manner. It is a little more proactive than what I was doing.

Too bad stories like that won't make it past corporate controlled media in danger by this disruptive technology. That's why the twist of forcing adoption to receive help would create the buzz. This Venezuelan is an absolute hero, but his story will be drowned by garbage journalism.

Ummm, It's called HODL. What is this; amateur hour? Lol.
@_date: 2019-01-11 21:15:41
Everything has some value, and Bitcoin shows that we can decide what we give value to. True HODL creates a supports that can actually be sustained, in my humble opinion. It is the basis of a portfolio that actually believes Bitcoin IS the future as opposed to "get-rich-quick" day trading, but without the movement it is nothing. I think we're working (or at least should be) towards that balance.
