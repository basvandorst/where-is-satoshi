May be your correct may be not. with Bitcoin, I wouldn't speculate or try to time the market. Just buy and hold for long time.
@_date: 2018-01-15 08:44:45
Not sure, Some company(Torguard) has integrated LN with their payment system. So there might be way to hookup to mainnet 
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:45:16
Ver is not a developer just happen to be one lucky greedy investor. Just can't believe some people fall into this guys trap. of course these guys probably got good $ from ver. btw what is the big deal making these block explores websites anyway?

Democratic countries will have hard time banning Bitcoin as many people from both left wing(for liberty/democratic purposes) and right wing( for making profit purpose) have invested in it. Good example is South Korea. If Government try to do anything, you will see big up-rise against it as both Left and Right wings will join together!
@_date: 2018-01-31 09:45:22
I am not sure what indicators better use. But I just want to say market cap doesn't mean people put down that much money into crypto. Its just a reflection on todays price * total circulating supply
I will give you small example, total BTC mine per day is 1800. Lets assume Coinbase get all the bitcoin from miners. So if Coinbase get 18 mil $ per day then it would be enough to buy all the BTC at 10k each. Now what happen if Coinbase get 19 mil $? Then Coinbase has to increase the price in order to tempt sellers to sell their coins. This could mean even after 11k or 12k no sellers would like to sell and resulting more increase the bid. Lets say buyers willing to pay 15k coin now then entire market cap increase by 15k * circulating supply. But actual money spent is just 1 million $.
@_date: 2018-01-24 03:28:15
If your transferring 10k to another country 30 bucks is nothing. If you have Segwit wallets then I think fees  would be around 10 bucks. If you wanna buy coffee, start playing with LN. Do not believe non programmers like Ver! Dont get me wrong, I own many Alt coins(except Bcash!) but Bitcoin got the best developer community in the world you could ever imagine. if you study LN its breathtaking.
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:24:44
I dont think its FUD article. Its reports job to report what happen during breaking news. Not investigative journalism. I've seen CNBC giving very positive news about Bitcoin too. I think SK Justice minister involves with insider trading and need to be fired.
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:08:47
I see. I do the same thing but they seems so brainwash with block size!. Thats the only innovation they could bring.
@_date: 2018-01-12 05:29:43
Can PineappleFund help funding lighting wallet integration to Ledger Neno? That would be HUGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:45:01
Yes. with Bitcoin price will keep rising forever if more and more people want it or use it. Its nothing like any other asset in the world where supply can be increase.  
Assumption: Democratic countries will have hard time banning Bitcoin as many people from both left wing(for liberty/democratic purposes) and right wing( for making profit purpose) have invested in it. Good example is South Korea. If Government try to do anything, you will see big up-rise against it as both Left and Right wings will join together!
@_date: 2018-01-25 01:14:09
Ledger neno is your friend my friend.

You hang around with wrong dudes mate, bcash has no innovation and hate LN.
@_date: 2018-01-28 01:57:59
bcash has no innovation mate. stuck with block size shit. bcash will go up as long as sir ver has BTC and $. once all gone, make sure to jump the ship.
@_date: 2018-01-18 07:31:28

@_date: 2018-01-31 10:32:08
Yeah, but I cant understand million dollar profitable exchange put themselves in big risk doing dodgy thing as media say. I mean all the top guns in exchange looking for jail time in US. why would even someone think such an act when your already earning millions?
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:03:35
Its not politics, they get paid by ver. greed.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:53:29
May be not accurate..People might not search anymore just go to coinbase directly!
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:29:07
**Keep growing**
@_date: 2018-01-29 04:49:29
I believe it will go beyond 100k within next 4 years. Specially after next halving. For the short term tho price will hang around 10k. We have only 1800 BTC mine per day. So each exchange get about 5BTC per day!. Assuming we have about 400 exchanges worldwide. So each one who brought BTC start to hodling or using it to buy stuff then price will skyrocket immediately. Then people with good amount of BTC will get tempted to cash out bit. This will help BTC spreading. Then price will stabilize again for period. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:44:09
Their greatest innovation is block size increase. I hope they keep it like that instead coping LN code. But some Bcashes increasingly supporting layered solutions. You could see some post popping up in rbtc indicating their interest. I hope their god ver will punish those bcashes soon.

Lets hope ver can never buy CMC with his money. I am sure dude approach these guys with his money. So CMC did a great job and deserve more donations from BTC loving people.
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:53:46
I think Litecoin and Vertcoin can use it.
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:25:48
if miners didn't sell their Bitcoin for couple of days, price will shoot up. we only have around 1800 BTC per day, so if the miners didnt sell for couple of days.. boom
@_date: 2018-01-27 08:45:04

gold will be doomed when asteroid mining starts. But Bitcoin will keep improving
@_date: 2018-01-28 06:36:39
Its because bcash is run by central government call Ver. He spend his BTC to pay for exchanges do shit like this. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 03:24:58
As long as Kraken doesnt go bust I am sure you will get your Money. Its just customer service is sucks most of these exchanges. They just can't keep up with demand. if Bank start offering Bitcoin that would be awesome.

easy, keep at least for 2 halvings and then sell
@_date: 2019-07-22 23:59:13
I see.. but still at least 60-70% use coinbase then gemini and others.. so 11% figure seems legit.
@_date: 2019-07-15 23:45:43
BTC dominance is more than 95%, little bit of ETH and LTC then. rest is negligible. Basically you can create a 1 trillion ETH token then get listed in one of tiny corrupted exchange then buy 1 token for 1$ and you have 1 trillion market cap.
@_date: 2019-07-23 06:01:55
I dont think there is way to 100% anonymize anything in digital world. There is a always chance someone better than you figure out who you are. There weren't chain analysis companies in the past but now there are!
@_date: 2018-01-12 05:26:38
Is this Segwit wallet? so you basically spend $7 for sending around $1000 at current BTC price. Not bad specially if you send this money overseas using WU or bank it will cost more than $15 I guess.

Invest 5%-10% of your portfolio in Bitcoin. Buy anytime you feel good. Dont try to time the market, Keep the investment at least 10 years. 
First step of buying Bitcoin would be buying a Hardware wallet(Some people call it Swiss Bank), then sign up for exchange like Coinbase or Gemini. Then Buy and send your coin to wallet. Then wake up in 10 years. See the Moon. End of story.

hard to tell what the BTC price would be in 15-20 years..right now we can mined 1800 BTC per day,, after 20 years this will be like 100! So if it becomes mainstream by then I would think 1 BTC north of 10 million.

I think market is mostly without Koreans and Chinese now anyway so price wont tumble much. And in Korea, Gov just can't say Bitcoin is banned as its democratic country.

The reason is not practical is actually a computing power. To attack Bitcoin network, they need to secretly produce more ASICs than all the other major business produces. I dont think current mining pool can be bribed as they are made up with lots of individuals with different interests. For example if BTC and other pool to be bribed, they would have to give them at least 100-1000B as this would mean end of crypto currencies in the world and loss of all the future earning for miners.

man prophecy guy is still correct.
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:05:39
I think SegWit should be limited to small $ transactions( say less than 0.1 BTC) so as LN. This will help Holding.. Once mass adoption happens we could allow both SegWit and LN with small amount transactions. What do you think? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:26:55
Congrats man!


@_date: 2017-12-13 03:57:34
You can still buy 10 million satoshis for like 1500 bucks. if BTC goes to million, you'll have 100k!
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:32:16
Yep. I meant the other word :D.. English is hard!
@_date: 2018-09-06 06:42:58

LN can handle unlimited transactions.
@_date: 2019-07-24 06:57:42
you can create 1 trillion token shitcoin and listed on one tiny exchange then buy 1 token for 1$ and you have trillion dollar market cap. At the very minimum all the shitcoin not listed on top 10 exchanges should be removed from CMC.

put something you happy to loose and then stop watching prices every day. Unless US/EU/JP ban Bitcoin it will most likely will go up in the longer term. Timing bitcoin market is almost impossible with traditional indicators.
@_date: 2018-09-09 03:28:10
So he is OK with futures which does not need to hold actual BTC but does not like ETF which actually needs to hold underlying asset? Can someone teach this guy about ETF?
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:34:37
then you can buy 1 million satoshis.. still you will earn!..Also have a look Litecoin too.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:13:32
Sound like a someone paid by ver?
@_date: 2018-09-06 07:10:23
More BUY signal
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:52:44
Hold amount that you can happy to loose, in case BTC goes to 1 million, you will regret rest of your life otherwise. Also make sure your coins are not in exchange. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 06:57:05
Well he is wrong this time bro.  Bitcoin should be flexible enough for any sort of financial stuff. Storing, Transporting .. ect ect.
@_date: 2018-08-15 06:50:19

@_date: 2018-08-23 03:18:43
If one ETF get approved that will open flood gates to all other ETFs meaning trillions!. So yeah Bitcoin could shoot to $50,000 as soon as one ETF approved.
@_date: 2018-05-01 09:26:34
Ver is psycho. He is killing entire crypto echo system with J hookers. 
@_date: 2019-03-21 05:10:08

@_date: 2019-03-08 07:44:06
I understand that apps are open source but I'm getting increasingly nervous that one day someone inside the Ledger will add some malicious code to firmware that will transmit back our private keys as soon as we unlock the device with pin. Isn't this a possibility?
@_date: 2019-03-28 23:48:30
So may I ask why not doing it?
@_date: 2019-03-08 04:43:03
@_date: 2019-03-11 22:21:19
Is this thing leads to hard fork?
@_date: 2019-03-14 02:56:06
I believe Bitcoin will eventually replace most of the traditional things related to finance. In theory it will be much more worth than Gold because it can also do LN transactions. so $10-20 trillions.
@_date: 2019-03-21 01:19:11

@_date: 2019-03-21 05:13:27
but no harm can be done introducing trillions into the Bitcoin ecosystem?
@_date: 2019-03-18 05:47:14
Buy from any exchange and move your Bitcoins to hardware wallet like Trazor or Ledger.

@_date: 2019-03-08 10:39:57
I'm no expert. you mean to say that there is no theoretical possibility of this happening? when we put the pin, isn't that Ledger firmware has access to the private key? if it has access then what is stopping transmitting it?
@_date: 2019-03-09 02:54:37
Thank you for detailed answer. but where does Ledger stored private key? isn't in Firmware?
@_date: 2019-03-28 03:12:16
because Weiss is Wise
@_date: 2019-03-04 02:53:57
I see.. make sense. i dont like anything centralized. but until we have fiat we have no options than exchanges. You might say Bisq is good but to use Bisq you need bank account and to setup bank account you need KYC. KYC will always be in place for financial institution. Spying on data isn't new and will in place for foreseeable future.

OK your argument make perfect sense. but isn't the banks and NSA doing same thing forever? I guess coinbase appeal to certain kind of users who otherwise scared to getting into Bitcoin.

who cares let them spy as much as they wanted. if single company can bring down Bitcoin then I would say Bitcoin isn't world money.

@_date: 2019-03-01 00:31:44
I think we shouldn't get carried away. They still promote adoption of Bitcoin and we need to see the bigger picture. As we are still in very early stages we need even the evil actors in the space. Let people use their services. After all they are like a bank.
@_date: 2019-03-09 08:06:51

When people understand what real money is every market would be target! Right now, we are using fake money printed mostly by central bank and private banks. when you do transfer "money" using a banks, its doesn't transfer "value", its just adjust banks accounting database. Bitcoin is the first "value" transfer method over internet. "Value" can only exist in one place in the entire universe, that's why Bitcoin is so groundbreaking.

With current rate of GDP growth, after 10-12 years Chinese economy will be double the size of US! US will no longer be the economic superpower and that is the reality.  So world may use CNY than USD. Moving to middle ground Bitcoin is the only way to solve this problem yet Orange man doesn't have a clue.

@_date: 2019-08-01 06:08:51
dont believe conspiracies. its just supply and demand. gold supply and demand is almost constant and controlled by mining companies, while Bitcoin supply cut of half every 4 years. so we can expect boom and bust cycles until it reaches some crazy number like $100 million. at this point satoshis will be distributed to at least half of world population so will have less boom and bust

Not true, you need court order or insider help from ISP provider to find your location. Bitcoin got enough privacy for ordinary folks. If you need more, use LN.

odds are not zero!. depend on your luck!. why not just cash out and keep in the bank and then buy back if that is your plan? if your confident it will only go to 100k and then move to say 30k. but if its goes to 300k and then you might regret.

I also believe western multi party system is heaps more democratic than Chinese one party system. But these tariffs are just stupid. It will hurt US consumers as they are the one who will be paying. Do you think US can be economic superpower forever? Chinese middle class earning around $50k(~30%) is already surpass entire US population and both economies are already the same size. Chinese economy growing at ~6% while US economy ~3%. In a decade Chinese economy will be doubled and ultimately it will be 3-4 times than US economy. If you think tariffs help brings job back to US, just put 100% tariffs or just ban import altogether and see how it goes.
@_date: 2019-08-12 07:32:20
All I can say to you is think of its as very early stage of internet. I'm sure you didn't see Google, Amazon coming in 30 years ago. Think why you need 3rd parties to transfer value.

Venezuelan, Argentinian, Iranian governments also backed their currencies. keyword here is "backed by" though. Its used to backed by Gold reserve( until 1970s) but not anymore. So currently its backed by nothing. Government can print money anytime they want through quantitative easing(QE) and make people poorer. Did you vote/appoint central bank governor to make you poorer? QE is not very rapid in advance economies but systematic. If you earn $1000 today's value, it will be worth around $500 in 20 years due to QE. There is NO limit to how much government can print! On the other hand Gold is limited and hold its value. Same with Bitcoin, even more limited than Gold with mathematically secured and transparent. No person in the world could create fake Bitcoin. There are so many things better than Gold. That's why its considered digit Gold. Benefits? There are heaps of application will be coming to you with Bitcoin using its various properties. I'm not very good at explaining, So I would suggest you to research into money and Bitcoin and get some understating. It's the future, programmable money!

Most these on chain transactions are from traders looking for arbitrage. These will move to LN slowly. Coinbase is moving in that direction at least.

I'm new to this tech and still learning so I think you got extremely valid points. I thought when you send some bitcoin from Ledger neno other person can only see/trace-back the amount I sent not the amount in wallet. not correct?. How about LN? can they still trace? I guess ETH doing some upgrades with casper and other EIPs so I guess they will address this concern. I also heard Bitcoin got some BIPs to improve this area. So after sometime it will be good. 
@_date: 2019-08-02 05:34:03

I fully support high on chain fees. that way when no more rewards, miners will be still securing the network. Right now you should only use on chain if the transaction at least over $50,  for coffee, you will use LN, problem solved. In future on chain should be use transactions over $1000,To see the full effect on LN, we need Bitcoin to be around 1 million. Then you'll see
@_date: 2019-02-04 00:49:10
I guess if that the case, laws need to be updated/advance so that only person involves with the crime need to be punished not all the transactions involves all the way up to genesis blocks. dont you think? Apparently amazon has some patent  tech for precision tracking.

to be honest, its one of the best exchange you can find with your money insured.  I really like the idea bank selling/storing Bitcoin as oppose to current generations of crook exchanges. Banks are less crooks compare to those.

there is a demand. otherwise we would not process couple of trillion dollars last year. retail investors are continue to accumulate so as whales. I think whales have impact on the market but not as it used to be. For example Ver and Wu, they lost most of their holding due to bad decisions. also unless miners sell their coins most retails investors would just keep them..So supply is limited.

Make some sense but how do the businesses know which address belongs to which business, on top of that business can have unlimited send/receive address for single wallet. So, I dont think it would be possible to figure out values.
Again, if you receive bitcoins to different addresses each time, no body would know how much total Bitcoins you have. beside, even today criminals already can guess your wealth by using your job, age and lifestyle?

@_date: 2019-12-30 03:33:44
Small advice if I may. pls learn how to store it. Buy a Trezor. Write down the seed. Send few dollars worth BTC. Then wipe the wallet and restore using seed to make sure everything is Ok. Keep the seed 100% offline. Then your good to send any amount of Bitcoin to it in case if you decided buy more. Good luck.

Of course LN is the future. Its getting more user-friendly everyday. Once we get to the point where transactions are easy as savings account &amp; current account then more people would use it. Basicaly all the channels opning closing things should be hidden from the user. All we need is wallet with bitcoin account and LN account with separate addresses. Transactions between those accounts should be seamless. Transfer to onchain can have high fees and thats fine.
@_date: 2019-02-25 05:12:22

I'm 101% convinced Hal and Satoshi are two different entities. Back in 2009 when BTC price is near zero and no one cares about it these few guys just get together and developed it just like any other community product or some government agency like NSA funded them to developed it.  
@_date: 2018-11-19 23:35:52
its call fear of loosing similar to fear of missing out. in crypto markets you need bigger balls than in stocks. If US impose outright ban then price will decline hugely but having futures approved, I dont think its even remotely possible now. As long as US in, it will rebound overtime.

ETF is just a form of fund which buys various securities. There are 1000s of ETFs in US mainly buying stocks. Its easy way to diversify your portfolio. Instead of buying 100 stocks in Nasdaq top companies, you can just buy 1 ETF contains all the underlying stocks. Beauty with ETF, its buying actual asset not like fake futures market where you dont need to buy actual asset. ETF holds trillions of $ and imagine 1% of fund buying bitcoin.

Seems like you dont get how big the Bitcoin innovation is or do you? If not, think this way, since the beginning of networking and then internet people were able to transfer data over the network but they could never transfer the "value" up until Bitcoin is born. Now that's call beginning of new era. transferring data and value is totally different concept, with data, you can have duplicates but value absolutely not.!

I dont think Chinese girls like gold jewelries much but Chinese Gov buy gold thinking it as safe store of value. Indian girls sure do like those metal wires hanging around neck. Gold nobility comes from scarcity nothing else. Vast majority of people agrees that Gold is scare and put their $ into it. Central bank around the globe keep gold reserve thinking the same. But in reality BTC is more scare with fixed cap can buy and sell much faster than Gold. Move around quickly. When people around the world realize that BTC will shoot to Pluto.
PS: Also BTC cant be faked/altered like Gold. If your no gold expert and trying to buy then your in mercy of retailer.

of course Bitcoin would be far superior version of gold. You can't buy coffee with gold but with LN you can do pretty much anything. if you also look there is growing number of real estate offering you can buy with Bitcoins but not with Gold.

going by your post history, you seems Bitcoin skeptic. There are 10 years old account here would tell to hodl too. For Libertarians ultimate objective is use Bitcoin in all daily needs. To archive that Bitcoin value needs to gain stability like a Gold. We need few trillions flow into Bitcoin to achieve that level of stability. Otherwise people with few millions can manipulate the market as you see today. So HODL and Buy is key to archive that.

Absolutely, that may not happen at all. I am not a time traveler. Why would westerners like Gold btw? I haven't seen western girls putting gold wires around their neck. So although its not useful to society people believe it has some value due to some properties I guess. Bitcoin properties are much superior. Gold, Silver Browns they all co-exist and they all have their own value based on larger consensus on people.

When Coinbase goes live with Segwit, it will be almost empty for next few years. So Stripe should add back Bitcoin before they are too late.
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:08:26
Its not difficult to draw a graphs in the historical data and get more than 80% or even more correct.(There are bots with over 90% success trading with historical data). Now try to follow the same Technic with real time data for next 10 years and tell me you still trade. What will happen is you will start wining few trades with your tactic and feel you to believe that your doing the right thing. May be you could have a 2 or 3 year winning streak. Then you hooked into it. Then start loosing and you wont be able to give up. If the trading is mathematically possible then bots will beat humans in no time.

Crypto market has very small amount of money in the world.May be not even 10B!. This market cap concept is totally BS!. So people with few millions can easily manipulate.

Bcash owner is US convict(check wiki) con artist who want people to believe his BTrash is the real deal and spending lot of BTC to promote it. He happen to be lucky enough to get into Bitcoin early days and accumulate lots of BTC. Now he promotes Bcash(BCH) with Jihan Wu and wanted to be the gods. Their followers worship them daily! Jihan Wu is the owner of Bitman Miners and Bcash fork help Jihan wu to gain unfair advantage over mining industry. Bcash miners need to have what they call ASICBoost which only comes from Jihan factory. So Ver and Jihan control the entire BTrash. Further they dont have world class developers and no innovation at all. All they want is selling Bcash and grab peoples money.

This is overblown thing..Yes may be in 10 years but my understanding is Bitcoin network can adjust without too much work.

You should study Bitcoin first. This is the greatest Bitcoin video I've seen so far. Check it out 
@_date: 2019-09-24 06:33:25
Are you trolling? you need to hodl Bitcoin at least for 2 halving to get rich. Which means about 8 years!

@_date: 2018-02-23 06:42:52
no they wont.either they will tempted to sell it( as price goes up) or life events force them to sell it. ie like retirement or very old age. imagine someone with 1000 BTC today. when BTC price goes to 50k he would tempted cash out half and keep the rest.(Assuming he got in at 20k). dont you think?  As prices goes up and up, BTC will spread among people with small quantities. Just like Gold. few hundred years ago, If you mine gold, you could have few tons of gold but now few ounces max.

@_date: 2019-09-18 07:24:11
I wonder how all the alts get pumping? is that because they all paired with BTC?
@_date: 2018-02-01 04:11:12
Its tether keeping market dim. Once they show account balance price will go nuts.
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:04:14
I dont think so. Probably bunch of people buying at 8500. Order books are group by price or something.
@_date: 2019-09-12 09:03:18
Bitcoin needs only 5 days to add 5k

No at all!. It will result in high volume + more mainstream investment + ETF approval from SEC

of course they are good for Bitcoin, anything that deal with Bitcoin is good.
@_date: 2019-09-23 07:13:29
It will take couple of months to get some volume.
@_date: 2019-09-28 03:14:31
I would say holding percentage is much higher than this. This is probably the lost coins.

someone seems got hurt by shorting..LOL
@_date: 2019-09-06 08:55:57
Got it, its more likely they use hardware walltet for key though. So you got to confirm it on wallet screen before signing. So pretty pretty secure.
@_date: 2019-09-30 23:20:19
I very much doubt 100k in 2019. Real rally will begin post halving. Check it out here 
@_date: 2019-09-02 06:50:01
Yup, I wonder how long gold took.
@_date: 2019-09-09 03:50:38
software wallets are more vulnerable to hacks. keep the coins far away from computer!

so funds safu?
@_date: 2019-05-06 03:57:53
Both trazor and Ledger are easy peasy. If the hardware breaks, you can get it restored using 24 words which you have to select at the start of the wallet initialization process. ( these words contains private key).
@_date: 2019-05-08 07:25:36
What does re-org means? hard fork? if yes, then BIGGGGG NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. exchanges will get hacked in future too. banks get hacked too, CIA, FBI get hacked too. that's not something we need to fix using Bitcoin.

This seems to be slow and dominant bull

I guess he is so convinced and didn't have the technical brain to understand what's going on. May be if he have grand kids, they might able to explain to him provided he is willing to listen. When your ultra $ rich and old, you might not enjoy lectured by young people.
@_date: 2019-05-09 02:02:22
I do not believe for second Vitalik is stupid idiot for even thinking a re-org just because someone steal his ETH
@_date: 2019-05-29 05:35:58
Last time I check Bitcoin was 3500 and now you say 8000? any asset will go up and down what matters is its making all time high yearly lows. it was near $0 not so long ago and gold took 1000s of years to get to where it is now.
@_date: 2019-05-29 06:27:48
Imagine there is a one cake in the whole universe and everyone wants piece of it, what will happen to the value of those pieces?
@_date: 2019-05-09 03:55:32
OK, lets forgive this guy.. probably he went mad after seeing 7000 BTC gone.
@_date: 2019-05-06 02:27:17
If your buying over $500 then get a hardware wallet first, then make a purchase and transfer coins to it.
@_date: 2019-05-08 07:17:03

Futures wont help with BTC value tho. ETF will.

Same question will be asked when its hovering $100k.
@_date: 2019-05-10 04:35:34
That's why company backed tokens will never succeed.
@_date: 2019-05-31 00:43:35
I dont think so, may be corporate level miners but there are 1000s of small scale minors they will sell on exchanges or keep them. As for power bills, I dont think so, most miners use hydro or solar so its minimum.
@_date: 2019-05-29 05:24:41
and when Bitcoin rise 1000 times after you sell, would you be OK? point is when Bitcoin becomes stable, you can just buy anything and everything using Bitcoin.

Your looking at all time high values, look at all time low values instead, to understand why people hold Bitcoin forever, you would 
 need to understand what Bitcoin is and how everything works, for that you would need to be very good at pure mathematics at least. by looking at your comments I dont think you know either of them, May be ask why Microsoft decided to build DID on top of Bitcoin?
