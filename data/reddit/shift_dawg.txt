and more conservative, proportionally, than going from a nickel to $100.  That was the hard part.

I've noticed that on most, but not all days, there is a marked upswing in BTC and some of the altcoins *right around* 5pm Japan time (about eight hours from the time of this posting).

I kinda made it up, fm Gk xeno-, meaning foreign/alien, and -pathos, meaning pain.  As in, non-Japanese are a tolerated inconvenience (whereas -phob[ic] implies that they are feared).
I fail at being funny/clever.

I've lived here for over a decade, and you're kinda right.
I would've gone with xeno*pathic*.

I got into BTC in late 2015.  Told a buddy about it, he seemed interested but a little scared.  So he wanted to try "a little."  I sent him a coinbase invite to get us both $10.
A week or so later, I asked him if he'd used the invite. 
"I started, but they wanted me to buy $100 worth to get the $10!"
I love to remind him how that $100 in 2015 would be $2000 today.

sorry, somebody shovelled drugs into me.
good bot.

they did this to me too before.  took a long time to resolve, but eventually it did.  Good luck.

It's really given me hope, following a very rough patch in my life.

what an *irrational* guess.

The price will almost definitely be between twenty THREE dollars and twenty five THOUSAND dollars.

Their image starts with a "4," implying Visa.

Thereby driving it up to $23-25k.

"Rebate," actually, but otherwise you're not wrong.

People understand what they see.
The easiest proof-of-concept that I've utilized to demonstrate that yes, BTC is money, is demonstrating the use of  the Shift card with Coinbase (I know, I know, yuck ...).
Have them hold your phone, go to a store and buy something with the Shift Visa.  Show them the card, make the purchase, and watch the surprise on their face when your phone buzzes and alert "You just spent .0000361 BTC at IN-N-OUT BURGER."

I believe that the proper past-tense form is HEDL.
@_date: 2017-09-28 01:01:43


K*iiiiiii*nda.  I use Shift with coinbase -- it's a Visa card, tied to an exchange account in which I keep a bit of bitcoin.  This essentially means that any place that accepts Visa debit (including ATMs) accepts Bitcoin.
And overstock.com is an outlier, but they made a big to-do about how they accept bitcoin qua bitcoin and intend to HODL it.
I'm not saying that you're wrong; for the most part you are correct.  But there are outliers.

I'm in my late 40s, so I'm on the fence about this one.  Not sure I'd wanna go through the Atari/Commodore 64/Duran Duran/Mr. T eras again.
