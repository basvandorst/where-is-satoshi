Thank you as well Zane. I have E-mailed yesterday (CST). I expect to hear from them today.

I think you guys are looking at it the wrong way. People who suffered losses are now shareholders of this company. You now own a piece of Bitfinex.

**USD that was being lent out for BTC

What's even more interesting is that next weeks episode of Mr. Robot is titled "Master_Slave"

No, that's not 100% correct. Look at it like this: If you have jewelry in a safe deposit box at a bank and someone steals your jewelry from out of your safety deposit box then that bank has no legal ground to make people who have USD or any other asset in the bank suffer for your individual loss. That's why there is an insurance market for things like jewelry and other assets.

Can you give us a list of the banks? Also, my usd was in my trading wallet and not my exchange wallet. Will I be able to move it to my exchange wallet when the site goes back up?
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:31:03
Not bad.

They are not insolvent. Poloniex did the same thing when they were hacked.

I really think you and your team are going about this the right way. Let the people who were unaffected access their USD/ALTS. It lessens the long term blow.

AAAAND...It's gone.
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:05:08
Horrible, horrible.

Because they had more Bitcoin than what was stolen? Because this is crypto land? Because they have the help of our her exchanges maybe? No one wants to go through what gox went through.

So eloquent.
@_date: 2016-06-25 04:52:41
You made my day good sir. Thank you!

I'll add to this. Also, If you're not a seasoned veteran/trader/whale, do not margin trade bitcoin. It's an easy way to lose Bitcoin and you will be beating yourself up afterwards like me. (Lost 1.8 BTC thinking I was an elite trader.)
@_date: 2017-07-13 01:30:56
The numbers will come regardless.

I'll eat my dick on national television for this.

Need the reupload

Confusing? It's Litecoin..u know..like LITE Bitcoin?! Jeez..
@_date: 2017-07-17 00:35:48
Hodlers sure hope so.
@_date: 2016-07-14 15:58:33
It all makes sense now.
@_date: 2016-07-07 19:57:09
I agree wit it.
