I left the comment on and was directed here by the OP. I know very little about bitcoin comparatively and I don't have "any skin in the game"; I own no bitcoins nor have any intentions of changing that. Rather I've read up on them some out of passive procrastinating interest. 
Most of that comment was just badly parroting much of what the original loper-os article said. Due to the nature of bitcoin, we do know that [many of the bitcoins are in the wallets of a few individuals](  We cannot speculate on the motives of the original miners or whether they really still have those bitcoins squirreled away somewhere. Some might say they deleted or lost them, but that could well be a small portion of the original miners. Additionally, if they have any sort of automatic backups in place, those wallets can be found again. And, I don't personally believe that somebody will flood the market for the hell of it, but I surely don't want to invest my money in a market that could be flooded like that. The motivations of people who originally mined are beyond the pale to the late comers and I don't think arguments based on what they will likely do are valid. 
The main purpose of my comment was to make sure a member of did not invest all of their hard earned life savings without first understanding the risk involved. It's easy to get whipped up into a frenzy over something as powerful as bitcoin and want to dive head first into it. I've seen some guys on that subreddit that aren't the brightest bulbs and I wanted to make sure they didn't do anything too hasty. I think bitcoin will win the war, but I certainly would not be comfortable putting my life savings in bitcoin right now.
