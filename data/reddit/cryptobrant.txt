Totally! Like more than 20 years ago in my case.

What a retard you are.

I’m 100% sure that if I wanted to move 200M to another bank, they would gladly pay all the fees + add a bonus to get to keep my money.

You don’t get “scammed” because you show your face on Skype. 
@_date: 2018-10-09 04:19:05
So he skyped and he got his BTC stolen because he had his login written on his forehead? 
Your argument makes 0 sense.

What a fucking mess. Retarded service.

This picture is not very realistic. I picture only one small MacBook as their server.

Real shitpost. Sorry but this kind of post has been poisoning crypto talks for months/years. You do not have a crystal ball. I repeat, you do not have a crystal ball. 
If you buy for 3000 and it fells to 1500, you still lose 50%.
Some people are waiting for reversal signals. Somehow it would be wiser to buy when it reaches $5000.

And it’s poison and making people lose tons of money.

You are aware that as long that you have your 24 words seed you can’t lose your coins, right? Because you talk about “scary steps” and “rings of fire” as if you were taking any risk by updating your Ledger...

Exactly. The only reason I can see for people to say he’s a nice guy, is that for now funds are safu. 
@_date: 2019-04-23 06:55:00
Another shitpost. I’m starting to believe that there is no crypto community, only a bunch of immature teenagers with a useless hobby. With this kind of help, crypto won’t get very far. I hope this changes.

This makes 0 sense. Why would hackers change the website design to perform phishing? 
@_date: 2017-07-27 08:14:16
Yeah, just I didn't write how much BTC and USD that was, because that's ridiculous amounts :D
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:06:23
I wouldn't believe a company tweeting about "maintenance" or "data center issues" the day authorities captured a guy that laundered $4b on their platform.
Maybe they'll be back, but I'm ready to bet they won't anytime soon. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:58:57
I don't see how a sketchy exchange involved in a 4 billion dollars laundering scheme could ever come back. If the reported news are true of course.
There is absolutely no way that the authorities would allow it to open when there is such a huge investigation pending. Probably a good percentage of the money in the exchange comes from mafia operations, so letting the exchange run again would make absolutely no sense. The company has always been very shady but they were established for so long that people trusted it.
I can't believe I let BTC and USD seat on the plateform since 2013 even forgetting about them, and last Monday I decided to move everything to Kraken to invest in XMR. That was so close!!
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:17:20
That's a possibility. But the guy was arrested on US Warrant (meaning he probably had strong ties with Russia already and that's why he wasn't bothered). With his companies based offshore, I don't think Russia will be able to do much.
Also if it were to open back, every people in their right mind would withdraw immediately. Not sure the platform would survive, nor the BTC value on the exchange. It would be much more profitable for Russian government to freeze the assets and let "business partners" take their share.

Not serious users. So much money lost in the end. Also the investigators are calling it one of the biggest criminal website in the world. This is the end...
@_date: 2017-07-27 08:12:18
Us investigators calling it one of the biggest criminal website of the world... I doubt it.
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:17:43
Sorry man...
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:36:48
I can't believe, I let USD and BTC sleep on BTC-E since December 2013 without touching them. And yesterday I suddenly decided to move everything to Kraken to invest in XMR. 
And now this. Wow that was close...
