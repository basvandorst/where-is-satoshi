That’s smart. Really smart

Yeah it’s coming. It’ll dip, and the noobs panic and sell their new btc.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:43:44
Litecoin is still silver to btc gold!

I mean - it’s good to diversify. I bought 100 ripple at .24 each a while ago and it was at $2 a coin yesterday.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:41:26
It was me. I bought in $10 entire dollars. You can thank me for this growth 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:39:26
Remember a week ago the over 9000 posts?

welcome to crypto 
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:03:07
yeah it cost me $20 to move $50
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:41:34
And now 1700
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:53:24
Noooo. Noobs good. Noobs make big growth. Noobs make moni$$

Not enough 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:38:42
what 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:37:08
Hi James, how are you doing?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:26:12
That dope
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:14:30
Especially since it’s in the news today. $400 would be big for a 14 year old and I feel like when news anchors say “ BITCOIN lurking up to 17k today” something would ring. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:10:24
Nah man he meant million
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:44:50
it works yea you can deposit, play and withdrawal with no problems
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:19:43
Nope. I’m still hodling my btc until it hits a 50k a coin 
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:33:17
Never too late. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:05:47
I just made $800 in one day omg
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:13:04
I thought it was a small little thing on a distant subreddit so I didn’t think it’s show up on google 
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:46:22
Honestly wtf lol why did my question get downvotes I just was interested
