Yeah, I know ... I don't get it, I always hear about how eBay/PayPal always sides with the buyer, but every time I've had an issue they've never had my back. 
Most of the time I've gotten lucky and could work something out with the seller, but even that is a PITA, why should I have to pay return shipping when they shipped me something broken and used when they said it was brand new?

No offense, but expecting to get paid for your work isn't being ego-fueled, it's being realistic.
Most startups fail in the first year, so promising a cut of the profits and expecting someone to put in a lot of work for you is next to useless.
Requests like the ones detailed in the original post being put on CraigsList are one thing, but to actually approach a developer with these ideas is insane.  It'd be like calling a plumber and asking them to replace your aging pipes ... don't worry about money man, I'll give you a case of beer or two, you like *$insert_cheap_crappy_beer_name_here, right?

Right, I mean his paper isn't very good for an absolute beginner (especially an 8th grader who isn't going to have $5k floating around) since it didn't even mention how to set up a wallet, but tells you to use one.  That alone should get some points knocked off. 
So, the teacher should have marked him down for things like that. 8th graders typically don't have 5k to spend, -5 points. What's a wallet?, -5 points, instructions unclear, -5 points, etc ... 
But, in the description, OP just says the assignment was to explain how to do something he knows how to do, not necessarily to explain it to an 8th grader, so he didn't necessarily miss the mark on the assignment. 
Limiting class work to childish things and restricting any higher level discussions seems pointless, but she can mark him down and then suggest he write about simpler things to keep his grade up. 
Or better yet, be a good teacher and help him write a better paper.

If you're a developer yourself and actively working on your project, it's better than a non-technical founder expecting the world with no up front pay.
Not saying you should go right out and start trying to recruit people, but it is at least a completely different scenario (well, somewhat different).

Not quite accurate.  
The contract doesn't allow the merchant to show credit as making an item cost more, BUT they can give you a discount for paying cash.
Not Allowed (strangely, **this** is the one I see gas companies doing):
* Gas Price Credit:  $3.25
* Gas Price Cash:  $3.20
* Gas Price:  $3.25
* 5 Cent discount per gallon if paying cash!

In an English class, if the teacher doesn't understand the material, she can just grade it on its grammar/spelling/etc... and how well the material is presented.  
I gave a presentation (not in 8th grade) on how to drive stick.  The teacher didn't know how to drive stick, does that mean I should have gotten a zero?

The text has completely changed at least once, but the link, which directs to a site to buy BC and BC miners has not changed.  I would assume based on these tactics, it's not legit.
Current Text:  The first memorial to Silk Road: ecstasy pills with the Silk Road camel logo etched onto the front, S/R on the back.[1]
Previous Text had something to do with a laptop being seized by FBI immediately after the PW was entered.

Agree ... I've seen the same basic rants from musicians who are asked to write jingles for $10, artists who are asked to make logos for next to free, etc...
Doesn't make it any less true or the points less valid though :-)
