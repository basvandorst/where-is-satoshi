When the price dips, it’s the market finding support. This is healthy. Had the price increased too fast and gone parabolic when we hit $13k a couple weeks back, the market would have corrected much more severely.

Schiff is a numbers guy so there’s no way he’s ignorant to these facts. He’s also well aware of the fact that he’s lost out on hundreds of millions because he didn’t transition to BTC soon enough. 
What we’re witnessing here is Schiff’s desperate attempt to stem the tide with disinformation so that he can salvage whatever’s left of his reputation and wealth as he steadily moves into the crypto space. 
Hi recent tweet, claiming to be open to changing his mind, is the first step in the direction of his new narrative. Once there’s no denying BTC’s universal value, utility and appeal, he’s basically going to use the fact that he’s BTC’s most vocal convert to reframe the story in his favor. 
PS - His gold company accepts BTC.

Yeah, setting aside the fact that protesting does jack shit, you can rest assured that governments and banks can do nothing to destroy bitcoin. They can make the on ramps and off ramps harder to access but this would simply create more demand and raise its value as a commodity (see China). 
Additionally, the War on Drugs and War on Crypto aren’t analogous because drugs are not a disruptive technology. Bitcoin actually benefits the wealthy as long as they get on board fast enough (see Fidelity). 
Banning crypto would be tantamount to the Ottomans banning the printing press for 290 years. It would result in technological, scientific, geopolitical and economic stagnation that would likely cause the fall of the US empire. 
The good news is that we don’t “have to convince people” of shit. Their own economic motivations will compel them in the direction of BTC. This isn’t like the killing of the electric car, when auto manufacturers, oil men and lobbyists were able to snuff out the burgeoning industry with red tape.

Most people are telling you to not give him a Satoshi but it’s important that you live your life with integrity. Ask yourself what you would want if the tables were turned and let your conscience be your guide. 
Personally, I would tell him that you feel like the coins are 100% yours but seeing as he introduced you to BTC, that you’re willing to give him a 5% finder’s fee. That should appease him while also clearly laying out your rationale. This also ensures that you don’t have to lie to a friend out of selfishness.

With all due respect, it sounds like you’re unfamiliar with the general principles of economics AND crypto currency. 
Your first hypothetical is utter nonsense and not only couldn’t be implemented, but would be the most suicidal, counterproductive measure that any government ever conceived. 
The second scenario is legally improbable and couldn’t be enforced. Additionally, once Bitcoin is labeled “terrorism”, people will simply migrate to another crypto. Governments know this is a losing battle for them and wouldn’t waste their resources.

First, look up the definition of “ponzi”. When confronted with this argument, ask them to define it themselves. Chances are, they’ll give you a poor answer. Correct and clarify. 
Then, if you’ve done your own research on Bitcoin, you’ll have all the answers at your disposal to refute their claims. 
As a general note, do your own research. How can you justify investing your savings into bitcoin if you don’t know it inside and out?

The only way to make bitcoin useless is to either replace it with a coin with stronger fundamentals or for society as a whole to completely revert back to the Stone Age. 
Scenario  doesn’t seem likely due to a combination of network effect combined with Bitcoin’s immutability and decentralization. 
Scenario  would be gradual, which might means HODLERS would steadily become the new ruling class.

Based on OP, I’m going to assume that your probably don’t have more than a couple hundred dollars so it really doesn’t matter. You probably won’t be trading so you don’t have to worry about those fees either. 
GEMINI is pretty good with their security, although most HOLDers would dissuade you from keeping your coins on an exchange. 
My best advice is to buy what you can afford and then spend the next 3 years obsessing over the fundamentals of BTC as well as the history of fiat currency.

1. We’re at the end of a cycle and banks have no choice but to lower interest rates, print money, and buy that money in the form of debt. 
2. If you cancel debt, you’re also affecting an asset on the other side of that debt, which is bad, so banks will simply print money as a hidden tax (inflation).
3. Inflation sometimes has a positive effect of stimulating the markets because assets appear to be bullish when there stagnant. 
4. Dalio doesn’t know what assets people will store their wealth in during this next crisis but implies that gold is a strong store of value.

This is a great way of thinking about the concept of bubbles in general. 
To the outside observer, it would appear that the dot com bubble negatively impacted ALL burgeoning internet companies. It did in the short term and 90% of companies failed. However, the really useful and innovative companies survived, got stronger and now thrive. 
The same will happen to the crypto space. A handful of winners will emerge and the rest will sputter out and disappear.
As far as value leaving fiat, it's similar to what Google did to the Yellow Pages, Thomas' Guide, etc. The money simply moved over to the better tool. 
Bitcoin is here to stay. If by some miracle, another crypto becomes top dog, it'll be because it's better. In that case, we still win; we'll have an even better version of Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:12:42

Interesting point about open source. I've always had a problem with people arguing that the first to market rarely emerges the winner (MySpace).

For anyone who’s self conscious about not owning enough BTC, look at it as a replacement for your savings account.

I should’ve prefaced my response by stating that I’m not an analyst or professional of any kind in the crypto space. 
However, it’s well known that large institutions have been increasingly focusing on crypto for the past couple of years. I don’t think giant corporations and banks would be so shortsighted as to implement a “blockchain, not Bitcoin” strategy without at least hedging their bets with at least SOME BTC holdings. 
I believe they’re building their reserves like the rest of us but are careful not to show their hands since it would only expedite their demise. 
It feels like fiat is a slowly sinking ship but the crewmen at the helm — as entrenched as they are in the system — are investing in lifeboats (see Jamie Dimon). 
Lastly, the hype for shit-coins is almost nonexistent this time around. The general public is wise to their shenanigans and it’ll reflect in BTC’s market cap.

It’s irrelevant whether or not the events transpired exactly the way the book claims. What matters is you based your comment on a flawed assumption which I quickly corrected. 
Try to remember that your original comment was in response to OP as though it were fact. 
Maybe check out the book. It’s a fun read!

As hard as it is to admit, we’re going to experience a correction after the next parabolic bull run. 
The key is to take some gains (12% or so) while we’re at the tippy-top. Then HODL until we get close to a new “bottom”.

They put millions of their own money into bitcoin when it was $8 because they believed in it AND knew it would be profitable. 
They’ve been working on an ETF to bring it mainstream, yet the SEC (and other governmental bodies) have unfortunately set unnecessary regulations and oversight requirements.
These guys are saints and they deserve your praise, not your negativity. 
So fuck you.
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:33:46
I get really annoyed with the way he pronounces certain words. “Sind and receive payments”.

Think of it from their perspective. They need to be as neutral and prudent in times of contention to not show bias toward one group or another. 
They’re playing the long game and believe in the protocol. That’s what I call a true HODLer and Maximalist. 
Heroes who popularized BTC in my opinion. 
Also, if you benefitted from the bCash fork, wouldn’t you list BCH too?

Anyone who’s heard him or read his books is able to see that he’s genuinely concerned about the well-being of others. You, on the other hand, seem to harbor a great deal of cynicism and negativity, traits that would have been remedied if you’ve actually understood his material and attempted to improve your sour attitude. 
If you’re including me in that lot of easily manipulated, vulnerable people, you should know that I personally own three separate businesses in NYC and am in the very early stages of nationally franchising. I’d hardly consider myself lost.
Again, I’ve only been to one seminar 20 years ago and read one of his books. I’m not a fanatic, just someone who recognizes his genuine desire to help others. You seem to just want to shit on people. 
Happy 2019.

I agree. People will readily convert their loose change to BTC and not feel worried about staking their entire fortunes on something the general public deems to be so speculative.

That’s not a nice thing to say. Plus, it’s not accurate. Animation is a fun and awesome career path. It’s made me a literal fortune which I then pumped into two bars in NYC and bitcoin.
People on this sub should be more supportive of one another. After all, the goal is to fuck the banks not each other. 
@_date: 2018-07-14 07:06:58
It’s not the banks that add legitimacy. It’s the widespread adoption that will. An ETF will be the vehicle that allows the general public to acquire BTC. I agree that it’s an individual’s responsibility to secure their keys.

Exactly. It’s easy to attribute the strength of BTC to its technological features or its first mover advantage, but what most people overlook is the fact that BTC is the only crypto that is effectively an untethered, digital organism. 
To draw out the analogy, all altcoins are artificially bred pandas or sea monkeys.

People often forget that these guys were Olympic athletes. This takes an exceptional degree of discipline, self examination and retooling of one’s skills and beliefs.

Correlation, not causation. The market grew too quick and everyone bought into the hype before actually doing their research. This lead to weak hands dumping as quickly as they bought in. 
The crypto space isn’t mature yet and public perception is still dodgy. That’s exactly why an ETF will help. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:36:26
Do it, dum dum. 
@_date: 2018-07-14 05:44:26
Banks didn’t cause the bubble to burst, overzealous buyers and weak hands did. 
I think we should view the rise of BTC and subsequent extinction of banks as an inevitability. Stop freaking out about banks. They’re going to follow the money and add legitimacy to crypto. That’s what we all want. In the end, regardless of how much the banks or institutions embrace bitcoin, it doesn’t diminish the power of bitcoin itself. 
Trust in the code and community and just HODL.

Peter’s argument about bitcoin not being scarce can be countered with one word: immutability. The fact that BTC isn’t controlled by a central authority and that Satoshi is nowhere to be found is one of its biggest strengths over all of the alts. 
As Andreas has said, the greatest thing Satoshi ever did was to disappear, the second greatest is to invent bitcoin.

I’ve been to one of his seminars and I can say with confidence that he’s a great human being who really loves helping people. 
I don’t really understand your reasons for trash-talking but based on your negativity and cynicism, I think it’s safe to assume that you could use some positivity in your life. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 14:10:49
You seem to think people come pre-equipped with the tools to navigate life, which is not the case. Most people could use some guidance and Tony’s ability to explain things in such obvious and clear ways is precisely why he’s effective as as motivational speaker.
I find it curious that you’re so quick to label him a “snake oil salesman” when it’s clear that you haven’t been to one of his seminars or read anything he’s written. (If I’m mistaken, I apologize.)
It may be the case that you’re fully capable of successfully leading your life but I would encourage you to not criticize others for attempting to seek different sources of insight. 
As for myself, I only saw him once, 20 years ago when I was just starting my adult life. Aside from that, I’ve only skimmed one of his books. I’m not a fanatic or zealot. I’m just defending the guy because you’re being a judgmental troll.
