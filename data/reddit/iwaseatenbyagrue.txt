My theory is that in an unregulated environment, all financial vehicles devolve to ponzis or outright theft.  Just a theory, cannot prove it, but bitcoin world has lent some support to my theory.

It is not certain banks will be robbed, and when robbed, usually the robber makes off with thousands, not tens of millions.  FDIC is there to mainly prevent a run on a bank.

You plug in cell phones openly.  Employers know that people do this and implicitly consent to it by not objecting.  Employers would rather provide this convenience, as being stingy here would cost too much goodwill.
Pens are usually meant to be taken, though not in such quantities as to fill up your drawers at home - that would also be blatant thievery.
I cannot believe you are so thick that you equate those minor costs with potentially hundreds if not thousands of dollars per month in electricity costs taken without the employer's knowledge and consent.
People like you give bitcoin a bad name.

You are confusing legal issues here.  With the segway, this guy was working in Germany where they have stricter protections against wrongful termination.  In America, this would be a non-issue, unless he is in a protected class (race, age, etc.) and could show the power usage was a pretext.  The issue in the case was not so much theft, as employment protection.
The examples you bring up, well these are leases, where electric is free.  So the landlord is getting paid for providing unlimited electricity, and I suspect that if you dig deep into those agreements, you will find abuse clauses.
And yes, maybe a single miner might not be noticed, but the OP is still basically proposing that hey, they employer should pay an extra $100 of electricity, while I pocket $100 in bitcoins.  Good deal, huh?  This is not an issue of convenience, like having your cell phone not die.  This is naked profiteering on someone else's dime.  And what happens when OP wants to expand his operation?  I assume your logic still holds?
These are not the same things at all.  If he wants to be a miner, fine, he just needs to pay for his own power.

The current flash return rate is 0.15% per day, and that is the rate you are likely to get (see the website for more explanation of the FRR, but let's just say for the time being that is the rate you get).  So this is 4.5% per month, but Bitfinex charges 15% of that, so your real monthly return is about 4%, which is not bad - 48% APR.
But in practice the FRR fluctuates (if you invest at the FRR, you return changes as the FRR changes), and also often shorters will repay earlier than a month, and your bitcoins will idle for a while before being relent.  But this gives you a ballpark idea.
I have never lent out bitcoins but rather USD on bitfinex, as those rates were more attractive (people bullish on Bitcoin), but now it seems market sentiment is different.

Good point, I do not have a control in the scientific sense, but I liked Doge, and Doge introduced me to Bitcoin.  And then it became about Nascar for some reason, though in fairness, there were not a lot of serious topics anyway, but what few there were became even harder to find.

I am not sure that he is.  I cannot think of any argument I could make to a person to persuade him to use BTC instead of credit cards to make purchases.  It costs 1% to get into BTC, so you are immediately at 99% of your normal spending power.  Who is going to do this?
@_date: 2014-10-26 15:56:23
Only temporarily.  Anything shorted has to eventually be bought back.  And if there is a squeeze, price can jump back quickly.  This is a commodity more than a stock, so it's not so much the fundamentals here (company on verge of bankruptcy and stock never recovers).

He is only buying $7K of bitcoins and he is very young.  This is not life impactful, even if he loses most of that in a crash.

You want Google to not be able to read any of your email but still send all your emails on to countless third parties who have to be able to read them.  This is not really practical, and this is the reason that parties who want to send encrypted emails to each other basically rely on third party services who host the text of the message on web servers, accessed via https (the email containing only links to such messages).  The private/public key system does not really work well with our smtp-based email systems.  Or maybe I do not understand what you want.

Most of the responses to you are completely retarded.  Whether recording audio of a police officer in Texas is legal or not is irrelevant, because it can be easily proved that this is not a recording device.
Also forfeiture does not apply here because the state is unlikely to allege that this device is linked to criminal activity.
It should not be very hard to get it back.

Yes, either that, or simply 18 months goes by.

You are right.  I am waiting for $10, and will consider that a moderate price.
@_date: 2015-01-28 19:15:14
You make a fair point, but the main selling point of Bitcoin are the low transaction costs, which I guess it has, but it costs an arm and a leg to get bitcoin in the first place.
@_date: 2015-01-28 16:08:51
5%, so only a $20 fee to get $400 of BTC and vice versa.  Wow, Bitcoin is really putting cash machines to shame!  I get mad when a cash ATM tries to charge me a flat $3.50.

I take it this is part 1 of 4?  I eagerly await the remaining 96 steps.

That is really smart.  This way you are set to consistently lose money going forward, and you do not have to think about it or try to time the market.  Money will be lost automatically for you!

You are oversimplifying Enron to blame it all on Ken Lay.  He was involved, but certainly not the most guilty.
@_date: 2015-01-14 05:11:50
So you should sell them all now in the hopes of buying 10 times as many at $21.
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:54:33
If they sell their Bitcoin now, sit on that for a bit, and wait for Bitcoin to go to zero, they may get solvent.

There is no statute of limitations on murder.
@_date: 2015-05-10 22:02:38
A much less riskier solution to all those things you mentioned are to buy American stocks or heck, just hold USD.  You said you feel Bitcoin has more potential to increase in value than to crash, but you really have no good reason to think this, I think.  You are just going from your gut based on very limited information.  You will find many more opinion on the other side.  Most charitably, you could say the prevailing opinion is that it is most likely to go down, but there is a tiny chance it could go sky high.
@_date: 2015-01-14 06:19:04
But if he buys 10 time as many at $20, he can bubble harder.
@_date: 2015-01-28 19:13:57
That is a fair point.
@_date: 2015-01-28 16:20:12
$2 to get $40 doesn't sound so great either.

In your snark, you are missing his point.  The mining add-on can be bought separately for about $20 (Bitmain's U3 is close enough to it, in terms of hashpower).  So why pay $400 for a raspberry plus U3 combo when it can be had for $60?
@_date: 2015-11-17 01:03:21
Isn't Bitmain's U3 about the same as a 21?

I am not sure I am following you.  My sweet dirty fiat seems to buy more and more bitcoins. USD ftw!

But they already accept credit cards, so that is a non issue.  But now they have to muck about trying to remember how to accept that bitcoin payment, which people do once a year.

I am sorry, but if you think that  is a superior place to store your money than a bank, which is likely insured by the federal government, meaning all of society would have to fail in order for you to lose your money (as opposed to some dude deciding to shut down a server and simply take it), you are a complete idiot.

Apple Pay has come faster in a few months than Bitcoin has in 6 years, so I am not sure how ridiculous it is.  I am not saying that Bitcoin has not been wildly successful for a piece of software.  It certainly has, dozens of people use it and the whole world has heard of it.  But comparing it to the Internet is a little premature.
@_date: 2015-03-08 20:12:21

Not sure I am following your logic.  It would follow from the first line that one 1914 dollar = one 2015 dollar.  Otherwise I would argue that 1 BTC a month ago = about 0.80 BTC today.

You are thinking small.  Instead of 1 miner, you need to buy about 50, and then you will be raking in $250 per year (or perhaps losing $1500, but who's counting).

He said that Bitcoin is mainly useful for doing illegal things.  You said that it used to be illegal for a black person to sit in a white person's seat on the bus, implying that what "ihatepasswords1234" meant is that bitcoin is mainly useful not just for illegal things but also for immoral things.  There is no reason to make this leap.
@_date: 2015-03-01 16:56:01
And he never said that bitcoin is useful for immoral things, yet you made that leap.
@_date: 2015-02-22 22:20:46
Also a fast way to go broke, as BTC is likely to drop in value between you accepting it and deciding to cash out.

I was using the 1:35 odds because that is one of the longest bets in roulette.  I think the problem with your reasoning is that it can just as easily be applied to going all in on lottery tickets.  We do not know what the odds are of becoming fabulously wealthy from your 10, 20, 100 bitcoins, whatever it is that you have, but you have implied that it is a modest amount.  My feeling is that the likelihood of this happening is 1/10000 or lower.  Now the odds of coming out ahead are much higher of course, but I am talking truly life changing turn of fortune, to where BTC will have to rise 100x or more.
@_date: 2015-02-02 14:45:36
It is more akin to a roulette bet where you are placing a huge bet on one number.  If you get the 1 in 36, you are rich. If you get one of the other 35 numbers, not so much.

Their arguments are sometimes one dimensional because many bitcoiners have a one dimensional delusion - they are blinded by greed.

Why the hell would any country do this, when 25% of this currency is controlled by a few people - Satoshi, Roger Ver, Winklevii, and the others - whose motivations are unknown (though I assume lean towards maximizing their own wealth) and who have the power to send the value spinning downward at any moment through a mass dump?  And why would any country want to reward those who hold this currency now, when they could just as easily spin their own cryptocurrency and then be able to have a premine and have some control of monetary suppply?
