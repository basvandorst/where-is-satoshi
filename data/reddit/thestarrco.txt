It's called Stockholm Syndrome.

You don't get it..can't see the obvious, because you don't want to.

Most people who lost money on finex didn't "leave money on an exchange".

It baffles me how people can hold an asset from $1100 to $170 and feel good about their investment.
And that was before ETH and XMR and others were around to provide real competition.  You had LTC and XRP but they were never that great.
But by all means , hold no matter what...regardless of what the price does and how the fundamentals change with competition, etc.  And we will see where that gets you.  Maybe $10,000 per BTC...or maybe not.
And I am bullish on BTC long term...but not blindly bullish.  And I sure won't hold at the top of a bubble and all the way down.

What kind of judge is this who cares about the US Constitution and denies unconstitutional search and seizure??   The prosecutors and politicians need to put more pressure on him to get in fucking line.

It is China pumping the halving, so yes both are correct.

They would probably kill it first. They've already done a good job of dramatically limiting its growth.

Hey worked so well in early 2014...why not.

Yes it's a new thing.

If no, he's still a terrorist to a lot of the dumbfucks out there.  And the media trying to play to the dumbfucks.
But you can't be a terrorist without some kind of agenda to spread terror among the larger citizenry or a group of them.  Just wanting to kill 30 or 40 people doesn't not make you a terrorist, even if you use guns and bombs and suicide vest, etc.

No it's more evil to the common person.  The common person who isn't going to care with BTC is regulated to the point where it's basically banned.

not yet

Yes and they want to ban cash too.   But that won't go over nearly as easily as banning crypto currency, for all practical purposes.   They are going to regulate the f*ck out of it.   They have been waiting for an excuse and this may not be bad enough to do it, but it's inevitable.
