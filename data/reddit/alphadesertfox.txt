Thanks again Luke. I'm not too techy so not very comfortable playing around with commands and the terminal. I'm currently just letting the wallet update the sync with the block. Hopefully it'll work then, but I was expecting it to work without having to do this. (I've backed it up also as suggested)

Thanks Luke. I've backed up my wallet. The new bitcoin core wallet is 65 GB so trying to free up some space do download the latest one. I'm worried my wallet has been compromised, read a few things about this old wallet not being secure.

Thanks Pinnpe. Coins are still there. Passphrase is still not working though and I don't have enough disk space for the latest core wallet. Any other suggestions?

Price and simplicity. I'm in Dubai and there's usually hidden tomfoolery with banks so having not sold on the exchange their before I expect there'd be hidden charges. But never sold on localbitcoins bitcoins either so wondering if it's difficult to sell on there also

I can't get access to Coinbase because of the country I'm in but there is an exchange so can try that over localbitcoins

$900-$1200 for me. The rise in price in 2017 has been very steep and looking at my own social and work circles I've had multiple friends and colleagues come to me to learn how to buy Bitcoin who have been drawn in by headlines from traditional media outlets and aggressive quick win promoting of Bitcoin on trading platforms who otherwise have shown no interest. I feel there's a lot of new money and weak hands who bought to make a quick buck and will sell quickly or be stopped out if on trading platforms and that this along with the uncertainty around scaling and profit taking it could push the price down.
