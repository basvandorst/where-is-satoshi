Just wondering if this decision has to do directly with BTC?

Am OP, can confirm.

You must not be familiar with the benefits of OT over Dark Wallet. You may reply once you have done some research.

Oh, absolutely! I am just wondering if another virtual currency will come in and take bitcoin's market share if it can do vero much much quicker. Such as feathercoin or litecoin. Also. If I were to buy products real time in someone's shop, how long does the vero take? Would this potentially halt adoption?
@_date: 2013-10-09 15:29:49

I'm so happy right now! Thanks.
@_date: 2013-09-27 14:39:25
I never claimed you said that. re-read my response. By claiming I am using a strawman, you are using a strawman yourself. And there you go with more ad hominem attacks.
But I digress, I have come to the conclusion you know nothing that you are talking about. Those people that did buy in 05-07, [here is the chart]( They doubled their money.
 If you want to continue with this dialogue let's limit the discussion, (at least at this stage) to our currency crisis at hand, including but not limited to (QE, fractional reserve banking, geopolitical politics, fiat etc.) I didn't mention anything about bitcoin and stop pretend quoting nonexistent people. Start speaking to me about the fiat system. Do you have any argument against the collapse of the fiat system (other than "it would be horrible if it did.")?
@_date: 2013-11-20 11:18:09

How ignorant of you to contain your "history" to the history of the US.
  
Every fiat currency has failed after being removed from a gold standard.  
Some "history" for you to research: (Roman denarius) (Mongols Flying Money)
  
Average length of time: 42 years. 
Time since USD has been taken off gold backing: 42 years.
BTW: The US will lead the next collapse.

He will say this could be used as ransom money. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:27:07
Not really, 875 to 810 means he had about 4 BTC. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 12:15:39
The problems you think are problems are not actually problems. 
@_date: 2013-11-01 19:44:15
Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2013-09-27 15:44:03
I am not referring to the article because I am specifically responding to your, as you stated "irrelevant to the post comment" with your previous (original) comment:
"Hope you all see it similarly or bitcoin is destined for the grandiose success of the gold and silver bugs... ie, not much but a bunch of bs hype."
Now for my actual response:
It is accurate to say the fed is printing money because they are buying 85B dollars worth of MBS every month. How does the fed get the money to buy these? It prints it or more likely adds zeros to a bank account to then buy them. You asked why fiat currency is relevant to the current and 2007/8 crisis. If you understood the history of fiat currencies or the petrodollar it would be extremely relevant to you. As for the deflationary indicators it is a combination between market manipulation and that making money available and cheap does not mean people will spend it.  QE, has created institutional investment, which is one of the reasons why stocks have done pretty well but the economy as a whole has not. That money has to get parked somewhere. Just because cheap money is available doesn't mean a company's going to invest in new capital equipment, build a new warehouse, etc. It has to see demand and projected revenues as a result of that investment, and with the economy stalled, outlooks don't justify the investment. And if there ever is the economic outlook that companies, institutions, banks are waiting for to spend that cash they have, they will do it at the same time and create hyper inflation (currency crisis) as all those trillions of dollars enter into the lower markets.
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:19:59
Did you find the answer? I am also interested.
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:10:59
What do you not understand about 


This WILL BE when the dollar ends. 
@_date: 2013-09-27 13:11:16
The Gold and Sliver bugs may seem grandiose to you now but there is/will be a fiat money, debt collapse once QE gets out of hand. I mean come on... the only thing propping up the economy since 2008 is the Federal Reserve's printing 85 Billion dollars every single month. How can the results of that aftermath be unjustifiably grandiose? 
@_date: 2013-08-05 23:55:00
What if the government declares bitcoin illegal to buy or use, would the price go up because the supply would be low and it would be hard to get?
@_date: 2013-08-06 19:07:49
Good point. I guess I mean locally, so my question is what are the effects we can see in absolute terms.
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:48:59
How is ACH different from Wire Transfer?
@_date: 2013-11-10 15:46:16
Depends on what the BTC will be used for. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:32:26

@_date: 2013-09-27 13:37:12
Well, all I just read was a long ad hominem attack from you. I majored in economics and have studied currency markets on my own for several months. After understanding the history of money vs. currency, inflation, fractional reserve banking, and listening to the announcements/movements of the Federal Reserve recently, I can best conclude that this money printing (QE) and the USD as the reserve currency cannot last for much longer. Additionally, if you look at what the BRICS nations and the middle east are doing to simultaneously get away from the dollar, acquire gold, and sell bonds you quickly see this is no conspiracy nor is it going to stop. I would love to hear why/how there is hope for the existing paradigm. Even if you direct me to more knowledgable people... I am willing to listen, but stop with your ad hominem attacks. They help no one.
@_date: 2013-10-03 14:53:55
Could you provide a source so I can read?
@_date: 2013-09-04 23:07:56
For the record, it was a joke. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 12:23:05
Didn't you submit this several hours ago?
@_date: 2013-11-22 10:43:22
I don't understand your response. What are governments/elite to do to keep people from going to a new currency?  
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:37:53
Could you remind everyone what ACH is?
@_date: 2013-12-09 06:07:02
Please direct me to a source. Everything I have heard is that OT will be open source and stay open source. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:22:05


What did you mean to say?
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:44:44

So Chinese or no?
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:20:42
Not really. I'd say with the recent Chinese stance on both USD, treasury bonds, and Bitcoin - be more concerned about the USD collapsing than Bitcoin.

I was hoping for a response like this. You're an idiot. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:30:40
hmm... "you're rich" seems to me like it is in the present tense.
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:29:51
Again, China's published and practical stance answers the question. The answer has been given.
