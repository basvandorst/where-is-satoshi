What could a lottery ticket be worth?
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:43:54
To some extent yes, you should not be walking around with large amounts of cash because there is always a risk that you could lose your money. Much safer to carry credit cards around.
@_date: 2014-04-10 17:00:56
I have a clear understanding of how it works. I don't like it because it is a speculative bubble. I have seen many delusional posts about how bitcoin is going to be worth $100,000... people literally thought it was a ticket to get wealthy off. I have been telling people for months that it will drop to $200. There is no intrinsic value. 
There are already thousands of bitcoin imitators. It is a fad and I doubt it will be around in 10 years. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:47:56
Sounds like stockholm syndrome... you lost all your money and still defend bitcoin religiously.
I think Bitcoin still has a long way to drop looking at the chart from a technical basis... it had a parabolic move up and has quite a bit of momentum on the downside. Sadly there are more hard lessons for speculators to learn over the next few months.
I'll be keeping my liquid savings in an FDIC insured account and gold... I will have no trouble sleeping tonight unlike holders of bitcoin.

Might as well sell now while there is still a bid in the market. Those holding out for higher prices are going to go down with the sinking ship. 
Since Bitcoin is like a fervent religion we'll get to see many people relentless holding on and dollar cost averaging all the way down to their grave.

The price doesn't matter! Great joke, I see people still in denial! The price absolutely matters. 
"Hey I got this great esoteric digital currency that most people won't understand. It's lost 90% of its value recently. Two major exchanges were hacked resulting in millions in dollars of losses. But the price doesn't matter...you should convert your money into Bitcoins to protect your purchasing power!" 
Yeah that's a tough sell. No one except the few still in denial with a desire to go do wiith the sinking ship will touch Bitcoin now that it has collapsed. 
When Bitcoin was rising up to the moon everyone wanted to buy in. It was easy to get Bitcoin converts to come in and try it out when they thought they would get rich.
Now that the price has collapsed there is nothing but pain and misery. 
My prediction a year ago was that Bitcoin would fall to $200 and we're there and then some (I was too optimistic). It was $10 just a few years ago... so it's not impossible that it goes back there. Of course, that would still be another big decline to go from $180 to $10. Since there is no way to value Bitcoin it is entirely possible.

If you have 250,000 in a bank account, it is FDIC insured Even if the bank goes bust you still get your money. The funds are secure and if someone tried to steal them it would be traceable.
With bitcoin, you deal with shady fly by night institutions. Perhaps they keep your money safe and sound, but maybe they decide to spend it partying instead. They can hacked or the government could decide to raid them.
You have basically no resource if your money is stolen or squandered. "POOF, it's gone!".

People are claiming their bitcoins are going to be worth millions because the coin is going mainstream. The problem is the majority of people in this world are not libertarians. So to the extent that bitcoin becomes a common form of payment (I don't think it will), then it will have the same populist calls for wealth redistribution as every other failed currency.

Bitcoin is going to $0 over the long run. I can't predict if fools will line up in the short term to buy bitcoin. It could go to $100,000 before it goes to $0... who knows. It's a bubble.

Cryptocurrencies are a negative sum game. There are transactional costs and opportunity costs (lack of income from real investments like dividend paying stocks).
Thus is aggregate all of the individuals trading Bitcoin will be poorer on a net basis... with the Exchanges making a profit for running the casino.
@_date: 2017-09-21 17:20:57
The reason for the dip is that the bitcoin bubble is starting to burst. It is running out of buyers.
Everyone hoarded bitcoin because they expect them to be worth more in the future and there are few ways to spend them (few vendors that accept them for payment). The bitcoin price rises, causing people to demand more to "invest" in, causing the price to rise even more. A positive feedback loop. This is how bubbles inflate. 
An example of the delusion is that someone on reddit bought a car with their bitcoin profits and everyone posted how foolish that was because those bitcoins are going to be worth millions a few years from now (extrapolating the past into the future which is a logical fallacy). Many people expect to become millionaires and have their retirement plans thought out.
Once the general perception that the price of bitcoin is going to fall(or stay the same) rather than rise it becomes a negative feedback loop and the music stops. The mindset is sell quickly and get rid of your bitcoin before others sell and drive the price down even more.
Fools buying the dips will get obliterated if this is a trend reversal. That strategy works until it doesn't. Buy the dip only works in a long term bull market.
A few people who got in early are going to make a fortune at the expense of millions who get stuck with big losses. The bitcoin exchanges are also going to make a fortune in transaction fees for running the casino.

Many cards in America offer free foreign exchange. Capital One venture visa for example.


In America the cost is lower if you use a credit card. For instance, the price is the same if you pay cash or credit. So if they cost is $100, then you can use a 3-5% cash back card. This makes the ultimate cost $97 and gives me thousands of dollars in rebates each year.


Merchant gets payment instantly. Settlement takes 2-3 business days. No one cares how long settlement takes.


I pay my bill in full so there is no interest. Most credit cards also have zero annual fee.

I know that Bitcoin is headed to $0 since it has no intrinsic value.
Now you are correct I don't know how or when that will happen. Could bitcoin go to $100,000 before it goes to $0? Sure. Anything is possible. A lottery ticket could be worth $100,000,000. But is it probable? No. More likely than not people buying Bitcoin at these price levels are going to lose a fortune.

You can't do anything with bitcoin except exchange it with other individuals, just like fiat currency. There is no utility or cash flow to discount. For instance, a gallon of gasoline has an intrinsic value because you can use it to move a car. 
Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. The only reason you are able to exchange it to someone else for goods is that someone else also believes it has value. But of course, beliefs change over time. 
Thus you have people trying to convince people to "HODL" bitcoin and buy the dips.

And of course what would happen if they tried to sell to realize their gains? The price will collapse instantly.

It is a negative sum game -- in aggregate all of the bit coin participates lose money and end up poorer after paying transaction cost. 
Bitcoin requires a constant stream of participants coming in to lose money so that those coming in early can sell and make a profit at their expense. Thus HODL.

I think block chain is a cool tech don't get me wrong. The big problem? That doesn't make bitcoin a sound asset. There are 1000's of crypto currencies that do the exact same thing as bitcoin... thus the individuals paying thousands of dollars for nothing (a bunch of 0's and 1's) are going to be sorely disappointed.
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:17:53
Not at all. That is speculation.
For instance, if I buy a house and rent it out I expect to get a rental income. If I buy a bond I expect to get a yield return on that bond. These are real income producing assets.
Bitcoin is a speculative asset. Individuals are speculating based on the greater fool theory. I am going to buy bitcoin because in the future I'll be able to sell it to a bigger fool at a higher price.
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:50:21
You can't do anything with bitcoin except exchange it with other individuals, just like fiat currency. There is no utility or cash flow to discount. For instance, a gallon of gasoline has an intrinsic value because you can use it to move a car. 
Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. The only reason you are able to exchange it to someone else for goods is that someone else also believes it has value. But of course, beliefs change over time. 
Thus you have people trying to convince people to "HODL" bitcoin and buy the dips.

Exponential growth? A legitimate business can experience exponential growth. Their profits can rise to make money for all of the investors. The company can generate profits, reinvest the profits, accumulate capital and investment, and then use it generate more profits.
Bitcoin is a negative sum game so there's no growth. In fact, the growth of wealth is negative. You can only profit if someone else loses money, after transactional costs to run the exchanges and costs to run the mining.

Bitcoin isn't an investment. This isn't a business with a future cash flow that you can value. It's high risk speculation. 


Bad logic. Some people in the past were wrong about x, therefore another group of individuals are wrong about y.

Not at all. Many assets provide utility like a gallon of gasoline. Many assets are incoming producing assets like rental property or dividend paying stocks. Even if the market collectively valued them at $0 they still have a discounted cash flow that produces value.
Bitcoin on the other hand is just a bunch of binary 0's and 1's. It has no intrinsic value. It is only worth what another fool will pay for it.

Not sure what it matters. Bitcoin is going to $0 over the long run. Who knows how much this bubble will inflate before the end. Could it go to $100,000 before it goes to $0? Sure. Just like a lottery ticket could be a winner. But is it probable? No.

Yes. The internet is made up of millions of physical routers, network connections, and computers that entities own that are creating value to society.

Everyone already has a simple and fast transaction method. I do thousands of instantaneous transactions a year using credit card at zero cost. I've done them in Euro, Yuan, and Mexican Pesos with no foreign currency transaction fee. Thus there is no need for bitcoin to make transactions easier.  
I even get rewards points and a free 60 day financing from the period when the transaction takes place, a statement is generated, and the payment due date arrives.
I am sure you do most of your transactions via credit card as well.

You're kidding right? This thing already went parabolic on the way up to $5000. The wild high returns already came and are evaporating as we speak. That is an awesome selling opportunity for anyone who held out.
Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme and it is a legitimate critique.
Those who get in early are going to make a fortune at the expense of those who get in late. It is a negative sum game after paying for exchange and mining expenses. You can only become rich by buying bitcoin if someone else becomes poor. And that is precisely why it is a pyramid scheme -- there is no way for anyone coming in late to gain. 
Once the expectation that bitcoin is going to fall in price rather than rise then the whole scheme falls apart. Everyone is euphoric and planning to own a yacht when bitcoin goes up in price, but no one will want to own bitcoin when it goes down in price.
This is a losing lottery ticket.

Just because a bubble becomes a bigger bubble doesn't make it a sound investment. 
Lots of people thought they were millionaires during the dotcom bubble and housing bubble until it all evaporated. For a few years it was a fun party until the music stopped.
Everyone has been hoarding bitcoin because they expect it to make them millionaires and not spending. After all, why would you want to own something that will be worth less in the future? When spending does commence it will be a race for the exits. 
Once the perception changes that bitcoin is going to fall or even stay at the same price level then everyone starts selling and there are no buyers. It is a negative feedback loop.
