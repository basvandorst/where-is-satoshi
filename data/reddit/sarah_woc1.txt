Not a huge fan of Coinbase.
I use wallofcoins.com
even before I started working there ;)
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:42:28
It's not on my own time in mostly. 
I am also an avid trader of BTC and crypto, so I believe in the ecosystem of not only my company but of crypto in general. I understand people get frustrated and sometimes they take it to social media. Which I do not mind at all, I wasn't requested to help I chose to. I seek out problems, so that I can  not only better assist my company but better assist the customers. 
We have had growing pains in the past, as any other exchange has had. 
We are working every day to make our site and process user friendly

We released your order. We didn't scam you.  This was a user error, and was not the company's fault. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:48:10
Again, WOC cannot predict the volatile rate of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:05:49
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:58:54
I can refer you to my compliance officer, I will be e-mailing you his email and contact information. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:44:26
All of this. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:49:44
Oh well thank you darling ;)
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:03:34
It's probably the network fees. The fees have been getting insane.
@_date: 2017-08-02 23:06:58
Not on my end dude
@_date: 2017-08-08 13:45:30
We had a special seller dumping all of their btc; 
As of right now, (it is first thing in the morning) 
The lowest rate is  3658.54 if you put in 1k
Also, if you message me, theres alot of people who will sell like 500 worth, and under market value, just to get rid of it. but you would have to know the amount to type in and what bank has it. I usually post it.
:) 
Sorry;; 
@_date: 2017-08-02 22:32:36
plot twist comcast stole all your coins.
@_date: 2017-08-02 22:11:14
@_date: 2017-08-02 22:11:32
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:03:46
I definitely do work for them, if you go to wall of coins reddit;
You will see that I'm pretty active.
But I'm not gonna argue with you.
Next time I post something, Ill screenshot it as a regular customer;
so that I have proof; :) 
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:56:44
it's still down on my end.
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:02:56
I'm not lying lol.
If I could screenshot my program, I can show you orders that
went through for at market price.
I dont know what exact time you did it.
You can think whatever you'd like.
Every one is allowed to have their own opinion.
@_date: 2017-08-01 23:09:02
@_date: 2017-08-08 16:50:26
First come first serve, ya know?
Shoulda hit me up, but to answer the original question.
Im definitely a "robot". 
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:19:34
0.04= 137.13 
as you can see if i was to buy that right now 
(refer to the image)
@_date: 2017-08-08 16:47:59
I watched plenty of orders, go through that were at market price.
I find it slightly amusing, tyou think I would lie to you?
It was until 4pm EST; 
3378.35	&gt;&gt;  at 4:04 PM.
3108.83&gt;&gt; at 11am


Those are just a few of the rates, that were processed, and completed yesterday.
I can't screenshot my system.
But, I have absolutely no reason to lie to you?
@_date: 2017-08-02 22:39:55
yeah already saw it.
I'm still at work atm, and Im allowed to be on reddit every few hours because I work with WOC make sure theres no damage control needed.
Im really interested, I withdrew my funds from poloniex, and put them on cold storage  before the fork.
Plot twist: comcast steals everyones coinss
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:23:01
Again, I just told you it depends on the sellers min and maximum.
If you were actually interested in buying bitcoin.
I could help you.
I'm pretty done replying.
I don't personally like to deal with condescending people.
It's not my forte :)
 Have a great evening. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 22:02:18
Where is everyone freaking out at?

Localbitcoins, price is super high, 
we have at market price.
We only deal with FIAT though for the most part.
You can DM me. :)
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:18:46
Proof, from today;
Different Bank, obviously because the other seller (the original seller I posted for) 
ran out of coins yesterday. 
Maybe next time you'll hit me up :)
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:44:48
im crying, i dont know if its tears of sadness, or amusement.
i can't decide
@_date: 2017-08-02 23:00:11
Don't knock it till you try it.
More of a cunt, I would say.
I can't help it, though.
@_date: 2017-08-08 13:41:06
Definitely real.
I can show you otherwise.  
You might have to do smaller orders;
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:54:08
Hmmm. Interesting, its down on my end too obviously.
Maybe everyone is freaking out
but with all these exchanges going down for
mt gox shit and cryptsy connections..
I understand people freaking the fuck out. 
Also, they didnt release any BCC/BCH/XBC or wtfever everyone is calling it.. when the fork happened unlike other exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:59:17

Thank you so much!!! :D 
Anytime, anytime at all!
@_date: 2017-09-26 22:40:53
That does sometimes happen. If we've asked for it, it's just us doing our due diligence. This isn't every order, but some you do have to provide identification. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:03:15
I agree I work at an exchange; I was helping her, I caught him was able to save her a few hundred, started talking to her, and she told me how much she got taken for; 
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:47:33
Did this order every get taken care of? 
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:07:02
or use WallofCoins and use FIAT.
I actually just wrote an article on decentralization. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:04:28
 I havent forgotten about you, Ive been working on this order diligently but also don't forget we dont accept online orders, so there is due diligence we need to do to be able to do anything.
@_date: 2017-09-26 22:47:39
I'm sorry you guys had such a bad experience, sometimes definitely your first time, it may be a little annoying, if you guys have any more issues please let me know! 
@_date: 2017-09-26 22:51:12
Actually it's not necessarily advertised that  we don't ask for ID(some crypto forums, may tell you that, but we don't advertise that, and the above user is right KYC is definitely a thing). I'm sorry again you've been having an issue. At this point, you're better off sending in your ID so that we can process it. It just has to be a government issue ID.
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:22:34

@_date: 2017-09-08 20:25:41
maybe other scams too, I just know this older lady was definitely effected by this. which is really sad. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:22:58
however we are cash only. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:29:57
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:29:17
he's also a stupid scammer too
@_date: 2018-04-11 11:38:17
Unfortunately, I no longer work for the company, so I cannot assist. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:41:11
Just trying to feel stuff out. :)
Im glad you had no issues!
I'm hoping the rest of the responses will be the same.
