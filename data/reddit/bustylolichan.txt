Yeah... Sorry about that. It is brand new, just built, and it turns out there was an error in the back end code that communicates with bitcoin RPC daemon and updates the data base server accordingly.
I would have fixed it faster, but I had actually gone to sleep.
I have fixed it now, and I'm really sorry for the inconvenience

What do you mean by 12% house advantage?
44% leaves the house with a 6% advantage...
Also, I'm trying to make money and provide a fun way for other people to also win some money. These are probably the best odds you'll ever find at anything related to casino or gambling. I'm not trying to run a charity lol

The seed itself is partially RNGed from the wallet address and this can change things greatly...
I changed the percentage a little bit...
And now, after testing again multiple times with multiple addresses there is anywhere from a 47.18% to 50.52% win rate...
Honestly it fluctuates... there's a lot that goes into it... your win chance will fluctuate based on the wallet address you are given and that's RNGed from bitcoind when you click place bet the way anyone would make an address....

Seed is taken as the current DateTime modulus the wallet address you are
given and then passed into the C# Random function to generate all numbers
you can check your results by the time stamp and wallet address with any
copy of C Production code is available for testing here 
All of this is explained on the site...

Maybe in writing, but if you look at the results of dice on crack (which is the only other gambling site I know of) I hardly believe their reported win rates are accurate...
Tell me more about these 1% house advantage sites, clearly I need to be gambling there...
