You're right, no mention of JoinMarket. It's a living example of some of the elements discussed and there's relevant data to be extracted.
@_date: 2015-08-30 18:04:41
You do know that you can request an api key and not have to deal with that, right? My suggestion to you, though, is **stop using online wallets!**

JoinMarket has a wallet tool albeit command line. I like it better than a gui. It is simpler to use, and you are in control as opposed to gui wallets making you almost a passive observer to what's actually happening with your funds.
Also you can use JoinMarket on Tails OS.

Thank you for posting this, it reminded me to get my tip from bitcoin/bitcoin!
Edit: Quite bullshit that I can't withdraw because I don't have a large enough balance. It's not less than the fee, so what's the problem. 


And I can see why. I could very easily imagine a situation where one would now search around for easy PRs just to get their withdraw. Rushed PRs are not the best.

My posting history is not about dnm/drugs, but in that subreddit. Apparently deduction evades you because the post your replying to is riddled with obvious sarcasm. But my point stands: this is reddit, don't think you're going to have some type of real justice here.
Did you really believe that I see theymos as "our majesty"?
@_date: 2015-09-14 14:56:02
WTF do you think the admins are going to do? They can't, shouldn't, and won't do anything. Because got this subreddit first and he can do whatever he wants with it (including the mod staff). Kick up a stink, pfft. Get real. Learn to handle your own problems and quit running to "admins."
 that doesn't like theymos, or this place should fucking leave. Quit trying to steal this place from our majesty and move on. This is the pinnacle of his boring midwestern life, and he's not going to give it away.

You're probably not connecting to the servers. What version of electrum are you running, because TAILS comes with 1.9.8 which is pretty much unusable. You need to download 2.5.1. See [here](
Once you have the new electrum installed, you can add a `-v` to the command to run it and see what your connections are doing. The link explains how to install/run it.
Edit: If you were using 1.9.8, I just realized that your seed won't work on a 2.x version. So in the case that you were using the default electrum client, run it from a terminal like this:
    electrum -v
Then you can see what's happening in the terminal.

I don't think that this is a good point. Regardless of the fungibility of a currency, one can always make his/her personal funds known. Thus removing the fungibility of their particular funds, but not the entire currency. Satoshi chose their level of privacy, for better or worse.

But you have nothing to fear. When more people know about and use JoinMarket it will drive fees even lower and increase the level of anonymity.

Is it making connections or is it spitting out errors? From this point I think I've taught you to debug this enough. You should use google with errors from your terminal. Have a good day, I'm just a little busy.

After re-reading the post you linked, I'm wondering if I should add `onlynet=onion` to bitcoin.conf in the script...
@_date: 2015-10-12 04:44:02
Maybe as opposed to centralized tumbling services. Many btc users are buying bitcoin from a centralized exchange and then immediately putting into a centralized tumbling service. So to use JoinMarket to bypass the tumbler the user now saves on fees dramatically.
@_date: 2015-10-14 00:52:39
@_date: 2015-10-26 14:49:15
Looks like you're right according to ThomasV: 
I misremembered. There was a version (before 1.9.8 I guess) where the seeds became incompatible I thought.
@_date: 2015-10-12 01:17:23
Yes you can manually review each transaction, you can spend from cold storage, and you can use P2SH.

You must be more careful. There is yet to be a standard for key derivation from seeds. There is a path that is used to derive the child keys and if two softwares use different paths, different keys.

@_date: 2015-10-14 15:10:20
TAILS will not let any traffic leave that is not over Tor. What I suggested to this user via PM was to sync the blockchain on a different OS without Tor, and then copy over to TAILS.
@_date: 2015-10-06 18:48:59
Correct. The way bicoin.com has it now is meaningless. It needs to be updated monthly or bi-weekly and gpg signed every time.
@_date: 2015-10-15 01:26:18


Yes. Doesn't leave the tor network.


That's the catch 22 of the whole thing. Personally I don't run my node with `onlynet`, but I have some of my remote nodes connected to it via `addnode` in the conf.


The devs have worked really hard to deter people from doing that, and I agree. Once users start punching holes, next thing you've got swiss cheese for security. 
It's really best to just sync initially on another device and then copy the blocks. Added bonus you have a recent copy of the blockchain for when you do something stupid and have to reinstall from scratch.
