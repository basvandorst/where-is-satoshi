As an expert you must realize your definition of liquidity above is incorrect. Liquidity is more about the ease at which something can be converted into another asset. The divisibility of an assets has a direct relationship with its ability to be used in trade. For example it is easier to buy things with bitcoin than it is to buy things with gold. However, this is only one of the definitions of liquidity. You are referring to capital injection, which is a broad idea covering some of the different ways central banks control economies. Deflationary monetary policies are not without their problems. No system is perfect. You seem to believe in inflationary banking, and that is fine, but economies in various parts of the world are experiencing hyper inflationary crises due to these practices. 
Liquidity: 
Also, this article from 2015 demonstrates what I am talking about:

I hope we see that price again! But I bet we see 36k first. Happy trading! 
@_date: 2018-01-23 04:47:07
This is almost exactly what I just said...... and what I linked...... your account is 3yrs old with no other comments besides the one on this this thread..... hmmmm. And you know nothing about bitcoin if you think it is hard to convert into cash..... 
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:35:46
Longer term yes. Maybe not this year, although it’s not impossible. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 04:48:24
Lol..... up ��
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:06:48
The Japanese government has passed a law requiring all business in the country to accept BTC, but no the government itself is not currently accepting it for taxes or anything like that. Am I confusing what we are talking about? lol
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:31:37
I don’t drink beer, so none lol. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 05:23:26
Just remember, if the price goes down from here we get to buy bitcoin at last year’s prices one more time �� 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:29:38
Because every Bitcoin is divisible by 10million parts, rather than only 100 parts like almost all fiat, this is not an issue. Actual liquidity is 2.1^14 or 210 trillion for BTC alone. But there is LTC and BCH and many others or something else we haven’t created yet that will provide even more liquidity when necessary. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:32:30
You can search things like “living on bitcoin” or others to see more information on this though if you are interested. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:47:10
I know why governments mandate the currency for tax remittance. Still, this Arizona law is going to be an interesting test. Obviously it should fail. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:04:01
Must not have been here in 2013 and 2014 I guess.... lol. BTC will be 36k sometime this year, probably more like 100k. This is a correction. One, which if you look at my post history, I warned people about during the run up in November. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:24:36
No. I accept disagreement, but spreading information that is false is FUD. Some points he has made in comments are valid and we are discussing them in this thread. Saying no one accepts crypto as payment though is false. Everywhere in Japan accepts Bitcoin and Mona coin. All merchants are required to accept crypto just like fiat. Many online merchants accept it. And Europe has been one of the fastest growing markets for crypto payments. Payment though is only one of the many uses for crypto token, really one of their less interesting uses imo. And look! We might have US authorities accepting it for taxes soon! 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:15:18
You are correct that these things are valued in dollars, or euros, or pesos at the moment. And will continue to be for a long time I imagine. USD as a “world reserve currency” is relatively new phenomenon though. And historically, reserve currencies do not last. 
When buying things in Bitcoin you are purchasing them for their fiat value, currently. And that does not need to change for Bitcoin or some other crypto to be successful. But to say you cannot purchase things with bitcoin without converting into dollars is incorrect, though still uncommon. Again, as I have said in other places it is not necessary for crypto to be as widely accepted as fiat yet. Already there are many places that value things in BTC or the fiat equivalent. I have purchased books, software, and even food online or in person with BTC, ETH, and LTC. And look! We can buy beer with bitcoin! 
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:06:52
Digital currencies are already accepted in many places worldwide and even required to be accepted in Japan. One day we will value Oil in a crypto currency and that will change the world. Not believing in blockchain tech’s future is like thinking the Internet was a fad back in 1997. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:36:38
Keep researching it. I agree that fiat is more widely accepted as a form of payment, but that is not an issue for crypto. In fact, payment is one of the less interesting uses in my opinion. Granted it is the use case most people are thinking about at the moment. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:56:09
And actually yes liquidity does mean how divisible something is. But I will not deny that bitcoin has flaws. The difference is Bitcoin and other cryptos are upgradable, fiat not so much. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:07:33
Most money only exists as numbers on a computer screen these days
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:49:19
Not sure what you are trying to say in your first point though.... government of Japan does not mandate merchants accept foreign currencies, though some vendors will accept them just like in any country. But they do mandate vendors accept payment in BTC or MONA. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:50:07
Most countries will not ban it. As we have seen from recent events. And if you lived in Europe you would know it is already accepted in many places. Blockchain Tech is the future not just as a digital ledger (currency). I believe you are here merely to speed FUD.  Crypto tokens are accepted as currency many places already. You are either not aware of this or willfully ignorant. They do not need to be as widely accepted as fiat yet. The Altcoin market has shown that ideas will be copied, and thus far that has been good for the industry as a whole. I do not understand why you are so angry about bitcoin and crypto... did you buy above 16k? 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:41:42
Either he had all the wrong .coms, panic sold and stayed out of the market, or a combination of the two. He should have held, or bought the dip. Everyone that made it through that time, bought the dip, or had bought the “right” .coms is doing very well today. One of my family members panic sold during the housing crash and got back into more “conservative” investments which have under performed the market rebound since. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:04:22
Your points about the masses are why I didn’t mention these trading metrics in the original post. These “99%” also tend to buy late in Bull runs and panic sell as the price is dropping. This creates distrust in bitcoin. I understand I will never convince those of you who have been with bitcoin for a while, even though you know corrections are real and the happen. We have the advantage of hindsight on our side in regard to the bear market of 2014. And in hindsight buying was a good idea, even at the top in 2013. At the time there were no guarantees. And the percentage of the 99% that bought in back then and held through the bear market..... is not high. We are in a dangerous place at the moment and that does not mean the price can’t go higher yet. At this point we are beginning to run the risk of a larger longer correction though. As always Trade at your own risk, these are just my thoughts. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:14:55
If your goals are long term this is true and I do believe we will see 30-40k within a year. There will still be a better time to buy soon. Dollar cost avg or place limit orders down the book. This is just common sense. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:56:07
Triggered much
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:46:36
Daily RSIs way oversold. Weekly TD on a bearish 9, 4hr RSIs high or oversold, near the top of long, long term log trend. Among many other indicators of the need for consolidation/correction. Not necessarily a “bear market” but a correction. 30-50% is standard for BTC. Advising people to buy anything other than dollar cost averaging at the moment is not a good idea. And I am not even dollar cost averaging until the daily RSIs cool off
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:11:17
You children of 2017 Bitcoin have only ever felt with a Bull market. It is easy to make money in a bull market. I am suggesting caution with your money, and these commentators are trying to rip me apart. Think about this for a moment....
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:07:00
I have been buying and trading bitcoin since 2013 fomo run, but thanks for your incorrect assumptions. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 05:53:57
How about that correction

Which place? Credit matters not at all, if you mean credit score.
@_date: 2017-05-24 02:02:44
Just in general, avoid PayPal. 
Coinbase works fine for bank deposits and credit cards. It has high fees and you don't really own the BTC until you transfer out to a wallet. Local works, but you will be more expensive and have more hoops like Wolf said.
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:42:57
If you have a BTC wallet I would do it via venmo or google wallet. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 23:06:24
It took a week even before the past 2 weeks. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:01:23
I'm still bullish on it for this year. It will be 3500+ by year end. 
For a crazy prediction: bitcoins are probably worth 1 million USD each. It makes design sense if the smallest division of a bitcoin is eventually worth the same as a US penny. And maybe it never gets there, but you will either find out with some bitcoin or without. Which position would you rather be in? 
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:46:39

As long as he stored them on in a wallet offline and you can access them, you are filthy fucking rich. But don't sell it all, just as much as you need. Will double again in a year or two. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 19:47:38
Caution is always good. I'm not too worried long term. Short term it is possible we could see prices as low as ~$1700, which I would love even more. I almost hope for that, but I doubt it will happen. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 05:56:35
Hahaha, I think we would have bigger issues to worry about at that point.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:03:26
Not really... at this level swings of a few hundred should be expected. I bought during the true crash last time and look where we are today. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 02:33:47
I'm one of the greedy ones too �� sold a little and bought some back at a lower price. No judgement. I am a little greedy too!

@_date: 2017-05-30 02:53:54
Considering Russia has been officially in a financial crisis for 3 years with high ruble volatility, we will likely see large investments from Russian citizens very soon: 
They can easily look at the value of the Ruble vs Bitcoin over the last 5 years and make a smart decision. It will be interesting to see if the wealth transfer, that is about to take place, crashes the Ruble. 
Historically the Ruble has been a terrible store of value. I think Russians will nearly abandon it for crypto within a few years. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 01:41:54
God I hope so, but I highly doubt it. I would buy so much more if that happened again ��
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:18:44
I feel like you are right, or at the very least it was accidental manipulation when enough people got scared/greedy and started selling off to preserve their profits. Still, I hope it goes down more first! �� Always happy to buy more BTC at a discount.
@_date: 2017-05-22 23:02:41
Coinbase (high fees, bust you can use credit cards and bank transfers, so essentially you can gamble with credit money for 30 days at a time)
Gemini (low fees, but low deposit limits for fiat at first)
Bitstamp? Can anyone confirm this one?
Wall of coins
Direct from other users (Always best ��)
You will have a hard time getting your account approved anywhere right now. Lots of demand.

@_date: 2017-05-24 20:22:23
Yeah I have converted to other wallets/exchanges mostly, but use coin still for payments too/from users- because it's free! Even though it's off block I'm not too worried about it for small payments.

Yeah, welcome to the ride. Some of us saw an 80% drop a few years ago and have recouped all that and much more, but be ready for a volatile market. This is a risk asset/commodity/currency/platform, whatever you want to call it.  Today's swing is pretty average if you look at past volatility. We saw an 11% drop from high today, but are essentially a 0% change in 24hrs... good to keep these things in mind. Or, consider we are up 77% from 6 days ago ��. 
Remember, this is about more than just money. You will have plenty of that. Welcome
If you haven't checked out the FAQ yet, get on that! It changed my life.

Not a guarantee by any means, just a hunch. Based on all the new accounts the exchanges have been working to approve and the ability to deposit funds into the exchanges. The transfers and approvals will all start going through this week. Plus people see a price that is on track with the estimates and predictions, but down from an ATH. Some will wait to buy on strength as it starts to rise again, but many will make their firs crypto buy this week in the US and around the world. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 17:32:46
I sold some I had been holding from the last $900 days for a profit at $1260 a few weeks ago, hoping it was going to drop back to 1k so I could buy again. I was wrong..... 
@_date: 2017-05-23 17:40:48
You're welcome �� 
Forgot to say though: Coinbase is probably the easiest to use for beginners, but you do not actually own your coins until you transfer them out of Coinbase. They store transactions internally and not on the blockchain itself. 
Pro: All transfers between Coinbase users are fee free! Great for payments if everyone uses Coinbase. 
Con: Fees and security - Those transfers are not stored on the blockchain. You do not own your coins and must pay the initial higher Coinbase fees plus a standard miner fee to transfer coins to another exchange or wallet.

I was in during the run up in 2013. The circumstances were different that time around and we dealt with the Gox collapse and distrust it spread after. I do not believe the price is inflated at the moment. I believe it has finally recovered and is back on track. I may be wrong, but I'm making a bet on growth that I can afford to be wrong about.
@_date: 2017-05-27 23:13:25
Many of us have been there
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:14:18

Left the following on a different thread, and think it belongs here too. It is important to look at numbers, and not just the ones comparing BTC to fiat. Let me explain the comment above:
Some of us saw an 80% drop a few years ago and have recouped all that and much more, but be ready for a volatile market. This is a risk asset/commodity/currency/platform, whatever you want to call it. 
Today's swing is pretty average if you look at past volatility. We saw an 11% drop from high today, but are essentially a 0% change in 24hrs... Or, consider we are up 77% from 6 days ago ��. 
We had a 9% drop on May 22nd.
26% drop Jan 17. We are up 312% since that drop. 
Imagine a 26% drop today.... that's a $650 drop.... can you imagine the headlines:
BITCOIN DEAD �� 
INVESTORS LOSE LIFE SAVING BETTING ON IMAGINARY COINS
THIEVES CON MILLIONS INTO BUYING FAKE CURRENCY
WILL THERE BE ANYONE LEFT TO USE BITCOIN!
etc..... 
Bitcoin is the future. It can't be stopped.

Yeah I bought back too. I have been following a "buy as much as possible every time it dips, even if it's just $100 dip" strategy. Putting money in and hoping it goes down so I can buy more, is way more fun than trying to buy at the low point and hope it goes up.

@_date: 2017-05-26 00:43:20
Wall of coins or localbitcoin is your best bet until approval. But don't worry. There is plenty of time to invest. Most people still have no idea what crypto is and have only "heard" of BTC. 
Approvals are taking a long time right now, but gemini or bitstamp can approve you within a week or so I imagine. Coinbase I don't know. I think they were not ready for this level of interest. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:58:09
When Bitcoins are worth $1,000,000 USD each the smallest division of a coin will be worth $0.01 USD. From a design perspective this is perfect. But this is based on USD thinking, which affects BTC not at all in reality.
