You must say the truth. You know it wasn't random places that had power, it was just the government buildings or people from the government. And you know they are the ones who mainly farm bitcoin. I'm Venezuelan too.
23 states of 25 went out of power and internet. No one has internet either phones. You know that's BS. Just the government had internet,phones and power.

Nope you are wrong US still buy my country oil, we still commercialized with another countries as well (used to work in PDVSA for seversl yrs) however our oil production slowed because the terrible politics the government made. As exemple Hugo Chavez fired in live TV several professionals and employees of PDVSA that's when he started hiring non professional or experts on oil just because they was pro government. Then they pocket all the income money and never maintenance the refineries, which now we have around less than 50% working, also, they loan money from international banks or countries as China and Russia using PDVSA as they active. What happened Russia is now the owner of Citgo practically and that's the reason USA sanction JUST Citgo because they are PDVSA branch to work inside USA with the USA.  Also they used PDVSA as their personal cashier for laundry money and funding international campaigns pro revolution around the world (how you think Sean Penn, Danny Glover and more were paid to advertise the government) 
The  resto of the sanctions are personalized against government agents and just the ones working in the high level.
