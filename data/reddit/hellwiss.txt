I have one idea. Say you are connected via channel to your favorite exchange. Buying btc there, right on their LN channel does not need any on-chain tx to refill your LN wallet, is it right?

But he is talking about the Bitcoin's capability to handle all the transactions in the world, from technical view, not economical. So there is not that certainty.
@_date: 2018-05-28 21:50:25
At the scale you are saying only institutions would be able to afford these on chain transactions. But on LN you should be able to do onchain tx from time to time. I see big growth ahead, but not to be able to stand for all fiat in the world.

He has a point.. When you are sure about your coins, that are legit and put them to mix them up. You are likely to hide something to risk mixing with coins you have no clue where from they are.

I dont imagine it as a website, more like opensource client, where you can make deposit and then play with others, then withdraw..

I think so, because when I was at their talk about implementing btc, they said it opened the gate to europe for them. That the payment method was limiting them and after implementing btc, their sales increased 6x first month and got stable at 4x after some more months (not in number of orders but in value, because lot of people were buying stuff for riggs, gpus etc...) I would expect slight decline, because their speech was about half of year ago, but they were very nicely surprised at that time.
edit: the payment method was limiting them before, but not for just cz and sk, they were shipping to some other countries even before btc, but implementing btc enhanced their reach.

Ledger is storing passphrase as secondary pin code. In the case of Trezor the passphrase has to be written over and over again to access the wallets.

Actually wasting lot of money for how many blocks? For how long? Even if you need more confirmations on exchanges, bitcoin won't disappear.
@_date: 2018-12-29 03:29:58
Great thing in my eyes is its trustlessness. You dont have to trust 3rd party (shop, internet service, uber? - I hope in future maybe) to give them your card info and be hoping they won't misuse it, or they can get hacked and again, it will be used in bad way. It happened to me once and now I really dont like to give this info to any shop. With btc, you dont have to be worry, worst case scenario is loosing that one payment, no info to take advantage of.

I gave friends a little bit of bitcoin and I have to say, I have much more confidence in backed up 12 words seed, than oldschool paperwallet. I printed paperwallet with passphrase, so it should be more secure, but it can be safely only filled... using it requires transact all... On the other hand, downloading for example Mycelium, creating new wallet.. back it up using 12 words into some "paper wallet" style paper and erase mobile wallet data seems much more safer and useful for me... And also your friend can use fraction of ammount there, without compromising the rest..
edit: By backup I mean physical non-digital copy of words.

Nicely said. I guess setting the goal and dont look at emotions would be a best way to success.
@_date: 2019-05-17 13:20:18
Passphrase is like 25th word, not stored on the device. Adding it just generates another set of wallets in deterministic way. You can insert any number of different passphrases, generating unique set of wallets each time. Passphrase is not saved, just the generated result is same with same passphrase.

So the green dots are between 5000 and 6000.
@_date: 2018-12-02 23:52:00
You can see that there are 10 lines between 1000 and 10 000. Each represents one thousand. But there are bigger spaces between lines near 1000 and smaller (more lines) near 10 000. Thats because this scale is graduating exponentialy.. 10, 100, 1000, 10 000. And thus length on y axis from 10 to 100 (90 difference) is as big as length from 1000 to 10 000 (9000 difference).

Yeah, make some more backups... Making backups does not hurt file (if it is not broken already). 
Also, downloading whole blockchain can take a while, to save some time, you can also download bootstrap - blockchain downloaded by somebody alse, you will just verify it...

But don't put there your wallet file until everything is done and verified.
