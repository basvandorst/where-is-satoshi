I'd like to see real experts in the decentralization area solve real problems of businesses or show how existing businesses could improve, for example how reddit could monetize.
I wrote a model about how the social media decentralization could happen and generate revenue. The model is based on the experience of several industries to generate revenue using trust.
I believe that there is a cross-point between 3 industries: the social media decentralization, the P2P commerce and the content monetization and they will grow exponentially if they shake hands.
Here is the model I wrote, it consists of 3 parts:
A whole decentralization roadmap:  Please let me know what do you think about the milestones I propose. I tried to be concise.
Lean Canvas about some of the core modules I observe: 
Some predictions how Facebook will evolve, accepting the models of social media decentralization: 
I think these ideas could be adapted to many other areas in the business, because we operate with trust. 
I'll be glad to give advice as an expert.

I'll be glad to see your comments here or in the separate reddit branch I created for it:
