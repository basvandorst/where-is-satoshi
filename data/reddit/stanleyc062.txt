Anything can happen in bitcoin market the price of bitcoin may increase or decrease. But I think this time it will take some time to reach $40k , so may be it is listed in bigger exchanges so it will take time to increase the price.

10k lowest. At Bitfinex at least. GDAX will go lower.

"What happens when there are no Bitcoin Miners anymore?
What happens when almost all the bitcoins have been mined and there are no miners in the system? who's gonna be there to validate the transaction blocks? Will the system still be working as it is right now?"

But Bitcoin network fees are getting outrageous. If I want to buy $10 of something, it will cost me $26 to send for the Bitcoin network fee alone ??? Another wallet charges $4 to send but $11 to receive.
Sure would like to know if there are better wallets around.

Omg i'm so tempted to buy right now... but I feel I should wait for 13,500. What say?
