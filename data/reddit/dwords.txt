I've been trying to wrap my head around this, UT. I wondered if there was a way to use something like Keybase to do this. In the future, the ideal would be an address that matched the book title exactly. Since not many books will be called 1zh8j1Fx------kHdhziF5UeTZmN6aFcP7 (address deliberately fudged) I hope that Ethereum, Namecoin or some future naming service will solve the problem.
Edit to spoil BTC address

Much appreciated, Lloe01.

That's a creative concept. Pay it forward on the blockchain. We're so used to watching our backs, it's easy to miss the light side of human nature.
@_date: 2014-03-18 22:25:00
True. However, it is easy once you have bitcoins.
At the moment the crossover audience of my current readers who also have bitcoin will be minute.  If someone with bitcoins liked the idea, but were too busy reading every syllable written about cryptocurrencies to bother with fiction, they could gift it to a family member and pay only if they report back that they enjoyed it.
I have been looking for a way to join my interest in bitcoin with my work. Priming such a movement would increase my own readership help other artists and promote another way to open up the gates of bitcoin to more ordinary people.
If you have bitcoin, you simply decide to pay or not. If yes, you point your phone at the QR code included in the book, enter the amount and that's it. Far less time than standing in a queue at the checkout.
Edit for clarity

A quiz or voting show (like xfactor) could tell you to send a number of bits to one address (QR code) to vote for one person/answer or another - with the possibility of winning prizes. You could do more complex stuff by using the number of satoshis as code (send 364 or 509 or whatever). Alternative, the show could create a special app that automatically signs an entry in a game with large stakes. Thus, players could accompany a payment/vote with a time-stamped message that could be displayed on-screen if required. Lots of possibilities. Added bonus is that they would be able to cut out the extortionate fees the phone companies charge for call-voting.

I love it! Thanks, mulpacha.

The free lunch thing is part of human nature but we're complicated beasts. Lots of people value their integrity. As you say, the risk is minimal. I'd rather lose money by people not paying (not really lost) than by putting hurdles in the way of distribution. You're right about the equation shifting with BTC uptake. If that shift is accompanied by a groundswell encouraging honesty regarding art you value, we might just swing sentiment towards a new consensus among those who care about these things.
Ever the optimist.

Love the video idea. A project for when I have the time.
There is a constant tug between doing all these things and finding the time to write. I see the value in doing all sorts of stuff but prefer to keep it simple. The high impact, easily actioned changes I make right away. Thus, the QR code is now there on the page. Thanks again.

Now included in the OP, Market-Anarchist
@_date: 2014-03-19 06:25:17
Great reply, WhiteyFisk.
Spot on with the good intentions but poor follow-up problem. I'll update to include a helpful contact link with that in mind.
I like the idea of being able to track with better granularity but the gain is offset by giving too many options. The message needs to be simple and clear. I also do not want to put a wall of words between the download link and the potential reader. I'll revisit this later, after some thought.
@_date: 2014-03-19 06:26:46
Good to hear, bgrnrg. Hope you enjoy.
@_date: 2014-03-19 11:54:20
Thanks,  FjornHorn.
@_date: 2014-03-18 23:51:23
Interesting idea. Txs
@_date: 2014-03-19 14:06:26
Hi tft. I mainly use Twitter as my news source, but happy to hook up with fellow bitcoiners. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 11:13:23
I'll let you know when making the movie ;-)
@_date: 2014-03-19 11:15:00
Thanks, neonicotinoid. Glad to hear you're enjoying it.
@_date: 2014-03-19 09:17:22
Once I've got enough data, I'll share the results on the site and here on Reddit. Thanks for the suggestion.
@_date: 2014-03-19 00:09:51
lol. No
@_date: 2014-03-19 06:27:55
Payment info is inside the book but you're right. Webpage is now updated to include BTC address. Thanks
@_date: 2014-03-18 23:44:40
Trying to figure out best way of reducing risk of people replacing QR code etc. Doubt if risk can be excluded but a central site where code can be checked or untampered copies picked up will help.
@_date: 2014-03-19 08:11:59
I see what you did there!
@_date: 2014-05-04 13:30:16
Thanks, Jak :-)
@_date: 2014-05-30 10:47:54
Good point - at the moment. Could use tvcoin or something, though.
@_date: 2014-03-26 17:40:20
@_date: 2014-03-19 06:09:12
Damn! Thought I was being so subtle...
@_date: 2014-03-19 06:51:38
@_date: 2014-03-18 21:22:23
Thanks, nieroda.
@_date: 2014-03-18 21:34:50
That is exactly it.
Of the 10K books, about 5K were picked up (attrition via wind, kids, street cleaners etc).
Of that 5K, 807 paid. Since I forgave payment if people did not like it, those who did not pay may have been honest. My best guess is north of 20%. It's worth noting that those who paid were not just honest but jumped over hurdles to pay. Given that any random reader is unlikely to suit a particular genre (in this case, sf) the return is extremely high. Marketers told me to expect way less than 3% response.
@_date: 2014-03-19 13:10:50
You're right, Lloe01. Good catch. Corrected. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-03-19 08:00:01
Thanks, mb. I take science and tech in the labs now and extrapolate that to a distant future.
Set in the present time and a thousand years from now, each book in the series concentrates on one of four siblings from that future. In an effort to encourage non sf readers, geeky stuff is in the background until the story develops.
In the Dreamwords future, technology is so sophisticated it becomes invisible - inside us and embedded within our environment. When something goes wrong, those who survive leave the towns and cities to live an almost medieval life, unaware of the hidden power they each possess, inventing taboos to cope with what they view as magic and evil in the visions they experience.
Tom Corven is a mystery set mostly in the present day. A reader unaware of the above, might think they are reading a ghost story. This is deliberate. I have had many readers tell me that if they knew it was sf they wouldn't have started the book but once they were in they were hooked.
I hope the story appeals to both genders but there is an element of romance there which particularly appeals to women. It is safe for young and old.
The Journal has a wider sweep. Unlike Tom Corven, it takes us forward into the future described above (can't say too much). It leaps past events (without touching on them) that lead to the demise of a modern society and lands in a place where powerful characters are learning to abuse and control the people through this strange connection they all share.
Each story is described briefly on the homepage here: 
Hope that answers your question.
@_date: 2014-03-19 06:05:56
lol. My fail on the pdf print size. Corrected.
@_date: 2014-03-18 22:30:37
Thanks, justabtcnoob. No need to wait. You can pick up the last two anonymously from my site at dreamwords.com
@_date: 2014-03-19 00:11:58
I hope so.
@_date: 2014-03-18 22:00:03
It's tough to peg a number on it, but I'm sure more would pay if it was easy, inexpensive, rewarded their sense of fair play and they knew that every penny went to the artist. Bitcoin makes that possible.
@_date: 2014-03-19 06:40:14
Wow. Thanks, Diapolis.
@_date: 2014-03-18 23:53:05
I may experiment with this (two BTC addresses to gauge result). Thanks.
@_date: 2014-03-18 21:27:59
Should my experiment work, I'd list any author wishing to do the same. If it becomes a 'thing', the books would be free to roam the Net, seeking out their readers via 'word of mouth'.
Some sort of central place would be useful, though, where readers could look for new stuff.
@_date: 2014-03-19 06:50:39
Constructive criticism is good, Chris. I'd like to claim the large PDF text was for phones but I just messed up and put the wrong file up there. It's now sorted.
I'll visit the other suggestions and include a high res image in the pdf later today.
@_date: 2014-03-19 06:05:14
Hi SD. The payment address and QR code are inside the book. That said, you are correct. I should include them on the site also. That's now done. Thanks
@_date: 2014-03-19 06:57:03
Thanks, fruitsdemers.
@_date: 2014-03-20 22:57:31
Thanks, drstrangedoge. Appreciate you paying up-front despite not having to. That seems to be a recurring thing here. Slightly overwhelmed. Hope you enjoy.
@_date: 2014-03-19 06:07:31
Thanks. You're right. Page updated to include BTC address. Will consider Coinbase.
@_date: 2014-03-19 06:46:16
The description is on the homepage. I've updated the site to make that more obvious. Thanks for pointing it out and thanks also for the payment. I really appreciate it.
@_date: 2014-03-19 07:00:45
@_date: 2014-03-19 10:42:04
Yep! Thanks, m4v3r. Sorted.
@_date: 2014-03-19 10:47:25
I have wondered about the cultural effect of different communities surrounding each coin. I'll look into this. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-03-18 23:41:35
That's the plan (address and site link). Good call on coinbase and bitpay etc. I'll have a think about that.
