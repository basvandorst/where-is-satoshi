That guy is "feels guy". To find this I searched "feels guy brain". All the results are a good time lol.
Edit: Also idk how well versed you are, but he comes from a whole old category of memes called "rage faces". Best to use them ironically nowadays though, they're out of style ��

Too late, already bought a pack of gum
@_date: 2019-04-11 20:50:45
Lol you're good ��
@_date: 2019-04-11 22:02:56
You have 4 mil I could borrow?
@_date: 2019-04-11 21:53:13
That's actually exactly right, lol
Edit: recently I was like $4 short on a stock I wanted to buy so I looked at my bitcoin and I was like "your time has come"
@_date: 2019-04-11 21:16:39
Lol! Actually, I was looking for one where he's like driving in a car and then he starts falling down a cliff.
This one is really good too though, thank you.
@_date: 2019-04-12 11:14:31
Did... did you just reply to yourself? I can tell you're both the same person.
@_date: 2019-04-11 21:57:49
Not that I have to justify anything to you, but that was just leftover money I had on Robinhood after investing in about $480 worth of stock. Which I'm aware still isn't a ton, but I'm fresh out of college cut me some slack lol.
@_date: 2019-04-11 19:02:53
Well actually I used Robinhood so it was free (I think)
@_date: 2019-04-11 21:52:47
I'm in the US, it was only available in certain states until recently
@_date: 2019-04-11 20:28:01
Okay that's what I thought. Still came out ahead though so ��
@_date: 2019-04-11 23:35:44
Because I don't know the future? Lol. I could just as easily have lost $98. Like why don't I just go back in time and invest in Google and Amazon while I'm at it.
Bitcoin is hella volatile. I invested $480 in other more stable stocks. I had $4 leftover which I tossed into bitcoin for the hell of it (which you'd know if you read the rest of the thread). Now it's $500. That's about a 4% increase. Sure, it's not nearly as much as the 25% I would've made with bitcoin, but it was much more safe.
@_date: 2019-04-11 22:09:51
Don't worry, I am. I'm just thinking btc is less likely to go higher rn so I decided to sell it.
Also I needed that $4 for another stock I wanted to buy, lol
@_date: 2019-04-11 20:34:21
If I just keep buying low and selling high eventually I'll have millions.
(While I'm here, does anybody have that gif of Homer saying that and then tumbling down a cliff? It was on here some months ago but now I can't find it.)
@_date: 2019-04-11 20:30:13
I mean... it's simple math lol. I got a dollar. Technically 98 cents
@_date: 2019-04-11 20:08:29
I'll lend you a dollar to dry your tears
@_date: 2019-04-11 20:51:52
A dollar in the hand is worth 5 in the bush
@_date: 2019-04-12 05:03:00


I totally agree. However, in my situation right now I probably shouldn't be investing at all tbh lol. Up until recently I was living paycheck to paycheck. But I've been doing a bit better now and I really like investing so I decided to do a little bit. I will certainly be buying more crypto at some point, but in my current situation I need to play things safe. I'm about to start a high paying job so hopefully soon!
Edit: But you will be happy to know that I have 12 Ripple! (That I bought at 60 cents sadly)
@_date: 2019-04-12 04:49:49
Lmao no it's not but you probably can. Please do and post pics.
@_date: 2018-04-02 22:55:23
You're good! Sorry, I might've been a little too accusatory. Nothing wrong with risking on something you believe in as long as you have a plan B and C
@_date: 2018-04-02 08:04:55
Nobody knows what the future of BTC looks like. Why didn't you spend the money investing on Amazon, Tesla, or something else that will be much more likely to see a return?
