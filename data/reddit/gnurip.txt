One of the licence requirements is that the top prize has to be one million of the local currency. So in some countries it's like winning £100 and they can't do anything about it because the british creators won't allow anything else.

1 Bitcoin = 10,000$
1 Satoshi = 0.00000001 Bitcoin
0.00000001 * 10,000 = 0.0001$
1 Bitcoin needs to be worth 1 Million$ to one Satoshi become worth 1 Cent.

So we should sell everything now and buy again before the fork?

When I create a wallet in Electrum and deposit my coins there. Would that do?
If so, how would I access the coins for that new fork then?

no it's not a fork, it's milliBitcoin 
1 mbtc = 0.001 Bitcoins
1 Bitcoin = 1000 mbtcs

The private key is the one you never ever give to someone.

I'm in Germany so I just used bitcoin.de when I started (in 2012 or 2013 iirc). Still using that. No problem so far. When the Bitcoin Cash fork came they added support for that, so I got all the BCCs without doing anything. And a few weeks ago they added Etherum. 
So I think it's a good choice.

It's there since a week, it already was at 5200 for a short time.

Do you know that feeling when you learn about stuff and reach a point where you think you know quite a lot and then your learn just a bit more and you realise you know only a tiny fraction? That's what happening to me since I got a Ledger. 
How would I trade on the go with the Ledger? I would always need my computer wouldn't I? My plan was to get a small safe at home and just put the Ledger in there.

honestly, I never compared to others how expensive the fees are.
If it's true that it has the best customer support and the best privacy I won't switch to somewhere else.
Also with the mentioned fidor account it's really great to have your coins, or Euros in a second. 
So even if the fees are higher than others, it's not too much (imho) and what I get for that is just a no brainer for me.
