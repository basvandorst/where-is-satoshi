The notion that miners have the option to mine at a lower difficulty I think shows just how bad the person asking understands the design. (No offense at all) It's the hash you have to solve that dictates the "difficulty".

The difficulty stems from the number of 0's that should precede the hash the Bitcoin network broadcasts to the world. The more 0's in front of the hash the more difficult it is, the probability that your hash generation will hit a hash with a certain number of starting 0's is statistically lower because you're targeting a subset of the available possibilities.  I hope that made sense.
Miners can't "mine at a lower difficulty" because they don't get to decide what hash was broadcast by the Bitcoin network to seal the block. 
It essentially boils down to this:
SHA256(data_from_previous_block + magic_number_you_have_to_find) = hash_broadcast_by_bitcoin_network
Where SHA256 takes the sum of those two things and creates the hash you're trying to find. Miners don't decide what the hash you have to find will be.

"Bitcoins illegal uses are good marketing" 
I very respectfully disagree with that. It means the average Joe starts thinking Bitcoin has intrinsically negative connotations. 
Anyway, that is neither here nor there with regards to the post.

The real question I think is, what happens to Cryptocurrency when you lose your private key? In which case the answer is the coins are lost forever.

Fiat and stocks aren't backed by a blockchain...

Oh man I don't know, how about a disaster relief fund address that can put the funds to good use? Just looking for ways to help with a technology I'm passionate about. I'm not talking about sending money to individuals, don't be a clown.

I'm at a loss of words to describe this gross incompetence.
