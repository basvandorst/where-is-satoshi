What is this? Some safe space where you cant say anything even remotely critical about bitcoin?
All points and opinions are valid and should be discussed here.

You Estonian?

This could actually work.

Circlejerking. Say anything about the price going down or the risks of investing and all you get is downvotes and "its not a bubble and its never going to go below 12k ever again."

Thats stupid. Wait until 200usd

It could still go down. Compare this to the other crashes and theres always some brief bounce back. Last crash it went up for 2-3 days before it crashed to 200usd

I have seen those Crypto accepted and Crypto ATMs all over the world while I travel. 
Should I start farming karma with the pics? 
Latest ones I saw in Georgia and Nepal.

This has to be fake. The bear buddies do nothing to help their poor friend.

Switzerland has many double taxation and money laundering agreements with multiple countries. I think most EU counties have some sort of agreement with Switzerland and if they ask if you have money in Swiss banks they will have to supply that information.
Swiss is not that good place if you want to avoid tax.

Yes thats true. But if you are a poor chump you head for Afrcia. Mauritius has no agreements with anybody and your capital gains wont be taxed at all. No visa required for EU citizens at least. Rent a place open a bank account.
Other one is Vanuatu just for something like 20 000usd you get a passport (second citizenship) and you can pay all your taxes there. Also no CGT there.

Company that buys bitcoins for you would be pretty good idea right about now. Especially if you have a MtGox account.
You can take a nice 4-5% cut from every transaction.

I know I should have. I bought bitcoin with all the money I got.
Didnt want to pull out my long term savings account funds that have 7% interest, I have about 20k in there. 
Just quit my job in january to go to school so I didnt have much liquid money saved.
So now I have about 100btc.

Have the same feeling when my wallet reached 10000€ in value. Now its already at 14000€
I put in about 2000€.

Reporters actually have Bitcoins now so its in their best interest that the prices go up.

I always thought it was a reference to this video.
Way funnier.
