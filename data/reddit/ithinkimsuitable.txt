Can you expose some bug in the othercoin nodes already?

Read the article, in an even more ambiguous case the customers won. In this case bitfinex set the terms ahead of time, then changed them after the fact. That is fraudulent, there isnt even a defence for them.

Its going to go down, some long term holders are cashing out which is putting increasing pressure on the price as new buyers are left confused due to the hard fork uncertainty.
Just wait a while.

They have already paid one fine issued by the CFTC. Seems like they are accountable, so its time for round 2.

They gave the terms ahead of time, but they actually changed their mind after the fork and witheld over 10k BCH from customers who had shorts open. SO they actually stole from their customers. Not surprising considering the exchange is a bucket shop.

It's like complaining that McDonalds is evil whilst stuffing your face with a Big Mac.

Bad analogy. The USA gov thinks btc-e is more akin to North Korea or ISIS. They slap sanctions on those guys without thinking of the innocents who will be impacted.
