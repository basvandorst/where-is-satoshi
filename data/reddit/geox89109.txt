Stocks actually serve a purpose. In an Initial Public Offering, the public is given a chance to own part of the company and the company receives capital to grow its size. The stock market efficiently values companies based on supply and demand. Poorly run companies lose value. Well run companies increase in value and potentially return dividends to shareholders if the company makes more than it needs to invest in its future. Having a stock market where the general public can invest and participate is far preferable to businesses that are all private and opaque. Many years ago, the government required publicly traded companies to update its shareholders on the status of the business every 90 days, known as quarterly reports. This goes along way to keeping companies honest. Information is now widely available, resulting in a much more transparent market. Does it have problems? Of course, but in aggregate the stock market works well.
I am in favor of crypto currency; unfortunately Bitcoin was first to reach mass awareness, and has been noted, is not a good exchange in value due to fluctuations, processing time and cost, and difficulty scaling. Other crypto currencies are popping, mainly due to speculation of the CNBC and reddit crowds, but it will be interesting to see if any can reach mass awareness, or if bitcoin sets CC back a decade as people realize that bitcoin itself is not useful and CCs are tainted by a bitcoin crash.

Tom Lee is a clown. Standing by his crazy bitcoin forecast last year even when it was obvious a major rebound was not in the cards. CNBC loses credibility every time they have him on.

Imagine how much easier it will be to understand when one bitcoin equals one dollar. No more .001 BTC for a loaf of bread and trying to figure it out. This will drive payment adoption.

You could do without the insults and put downs.
