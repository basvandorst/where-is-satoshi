Coinbase is really helping with adoption on a large scale.

Are you recommending local bitcoin personal in person exchanges? I have read recently about a bitcoin broker who escrows for a small fee.Please elaborate on a P2P exchange.
 I have been happy with coinbase but I may be looking at a large sell soon and would like to get the highest price with the lowest fees.

I am deleting bitcoin core from my pc and re-installing now.It is now re downloading the blockchain which is going to take a while. I tried last night doing a rescan but never got it to work. 
I tried in debug window and by changing exe file but the wallet is on an encrypted hd partition and I never got it to go.
@_date: 2014-05-29 04:30:08
I don't think my transaction ever hit the blockchain.

This is so true in my exp. and from what I have read from others in the US.
A while back I sent a few btc to my gox account for selling purchases. In the past I always just bought from them through dwolla.
 I tried for a while to link my bank account and other ways of getting some usd for the coins.I finally gave up and sent the coins back to my pc based wallet.
 In my expierience coinbase is the way to go in the US. My last sale will show in my bank account in a few work days.
@_date: 2014-06-25 17:15:47

I have been looking at selling some coins and I would love to get the Mt gox price but Fuck Mt. Gox. I tried to link a bank account which failed for some unknown reason. Coinbase works well and I get my money in like 3 work days now. Mt Gox may be okay if your outside the USA but I have found it immpossible for selling.

well I have re-downloaded the whole block chain and now my transaction is just missing,except from my balance.Looks like this btc is gone. you would think as advanced as the bitcoin wallet is it would not be so easy to lose coins.
@_date: 2014-06-04 00:37:42
Dude message me. I recovered my coin and will send you half of the reward.

I ran 1 7850 non-stop for a year straight. Starting in Feb. 2012. That card paid for itself well.  It had the lowest power consumption to speed at that time. [I was getting about .25 btc a week in the beginning.]( Still using it now as my display card.

ok no transaction fee. how do I send again but not lose the original money sent. I have read this   a few times but seems very complicated.
@_date: 2016-02-27 04:30:10
possible i was actually trying to increase the fee. recent transactions too k hours for just the first confirmation.
@_date: 2012-11-03 06:37:59
I just sent a few coins to my wallet and it took 3 yubi key presses to finally go through.
@_date: 2012-11-01 04:51:10
Mine wasn't malware,Mine was a weak password and user name that I was using at multiple websites. Never again. All my $ related sitesnow have strong/different password.
@_date: 2012-08-29 23:58:52
Well I was pissed when I wrote that.They may not be dishonest but do need to employ additional security for transactions.
@_date: 2012-03-25 17:48:24
1/2 % fee? seems a little steep.
@_date: 2016-02-28 00:17:56
can you explain how to do this?
@_date: 2012-08-19 18:49:55
Seems a lot of people were buying at the 7.50 mark cause it sure took an up swing when it hit.

Not just addicts.Believe it or not most people who use drugs are not addicted to them.
@_date: 2012-08-30 02:34:49
This I really agree with! Although whomever fucked me I think probably had access to my gmail account.
I'm going to look into the google authenticator as it seems reasonable.
@_date: 2012-11-01 04:53:21
When my funds were taken all my usd was exchanged for bitcoins and then went to Australia. 
@_date: 2012-11-01 04:47:24
sounds familiar, 
My gox sent me a free yubi.I feel dual verification is a must. Google authenticator seems pretty safe too.

I would prefer not go down to my bank (wells fargo) to deposit money that is already there.
@_date: 2012-08-30 02:29:36
Well I just spent the last hour and a half changing all my important passwords for accounts that can access my $.
I would suggest other users do the same. I think I have learned my lesson.
@_date: 2012-11-03 04:49:16
Don't keep any large sums of money online,send them to your wallet with a backup dat.
@_date: 2012-11-03 16:06:44
Thanks for the reminder.

Response from MT.Gox:
Looks like I learned an expensive lesson and now will be letting everyone know that Mt.Gox is unsecure and dishonest. Police report? I’m sure they will resolve it quickly and efficiently. 
Is it possible to trace the withdrawn address and get my money back that way?.

Hello Charles,
I see that the withdrawal have already been processed and you can see the same on the below link.
As you have mentioned that this was not authorized by you we request you to change your email address password and Mt.Gox password immediately and we also request not to use the same username and password on different services. You may wish to use the Yubikey or Software Authentication on our Security Center to further secure your accounts. Unfortunately we will not be able to reverse the stolen funds.
Please file a police report in order for the police to investigate the case so that they can make an effort to retrieve the funds and once filing a police report, please send a copy of the police report and your official ID document to Mt.Gox. We will cooperate with the police authority in providing the necessary information for the investigation, but we are unable to reimburse any stolen funds.
Let us know if you have any other questions.

They sent me a free yubi key after my coins were stolen.
@_date: 2012-08-29 15:18:23
Yes I'm pretty pissed about this but It is mostly my fault. I don't think its a trojan,Probably just being too casual with my passwords. Looks like I need to take my online security more serious.
@_date: 2012-09-30 22:51:02
"EDIT: As with any exchange, do not leave your bitcoins there for long and withdraw them as soon as you can."
Yes be very careful with online bitcoin storage.I learned a 2 hundred dollar lesson a while back.
Yubi key is on the way but I recommend double authentication and a very complex password.
@_date: 2012-11-03 04:47:13
My account was emptied a while back:
everyone should use two factor authentication.Mt gox has become a hackers dream.
@_date: 2012-08-19 02:31:37
Could be a great time to buy a few more coins.Any way to avoid the 5 day wait between my bank account and dwolla?
@_date: 2012-09-16 02:54:50
As someone who had 20 bitcoins stolen out of my mt gox account a few weeks back,this is very true!
I was guilty of using the same user/pass for many different online accounts,never again.I have also learned about hardware and software dual authentication which should be used by everyone.
Google authenticator and yubi keys are a necessity if you store your money/bits online.

They refunded my money today they sent it back to dwolla. Just slow not crooks.
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:47:28
yes but since I have bought it has risen well.If I bought 1 1/2 years ago I would be bummed. Long term its still good for all who have some.

After losing about 10 btc on MtGox .I changed all my passwords(everywhere)and use yubi key.I store very little btc in my gox account and transfer my savings to my bitcoin qt on my pc which is now encrypted.
As bitcoin becomes more mainstream it will attract even more thieves.
