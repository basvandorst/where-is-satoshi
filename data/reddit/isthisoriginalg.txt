The money goes from the buyer to the seller, it's still in the system. 
The buyer had $15,000, they purchased 1 bitcoin for $15,000 from a seller. Now the buyer has 1 bitcoin and the seller has $15,000 that they can spend into the economy. Money was just transferred from one person to another.

I don't hear any laughter but I do hear some clicks like the audio was edited. Can you check again to see if the audio has been changed since you watched it?

Same thing happened during the 2013 bubble. Bots on Mt Gox were buying and selling back and forth to each other, driving the price above $1000.
See: 
The bitcoin market is unregulated so all the price manipulation techniques that are illegal in regulated markets are used on a daily basis in bitcoin.
The bitcoin price is a mirage.

The gold ETF is just a small part of the total trading volume in gold.
According to the following article:
"Global trading volumes in 2014 was three times more than the 183,600 tonnes of the precious metal that have been produced in human history.
At an estimated $22 trillion trading value per year, the gold market dwarves turnover on the Dow Jones Industrial Index and that of the S&amp;P 500 combined, German and UK government bonds and even some of the top currency pairs."
