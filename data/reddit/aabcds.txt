Yeah because it was at over $19,000 in between.  Let's say you were making $1,000 a month, then you got a raise to $1,900 a month but a month later you got fired and the only job you could find was one making $1,000 a month again.  Would you be fine with it?

Yeah. It should be instantaneous. All the transfers I've done from Coinbase to GDAX and vice versa have been taken a second.
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:57:47
How is it illegal?
@_date: 2018-01-01 20:38:21
No.  The amount I withdrew from GDAX was the amount I received in my wallet.  There were no fees deducted because GDAX paid the bitcoin network transaction fee.
Coinbase makes you pay the bitcoin transaction fee when you withdraw from Coinbase.  GDAX does not; GDAX pays the fee.
They are different entities.

However, don't futures contracts have expiration dates though?  Meaning, if you buy a contract that expires in one month, wouldn't you have to wait until day 29 to dump to make sure the price went down by the time your contract expired?

It doesn't matter where you keep your fiat; both are FDIC insured as far as USD is concerned.  I was going to say that only Coinbase was FDIC insured but I just googled and found that GDAX has the same insurance.
As far as timing goes, I haven't done a bank transfer into GDAX yet but for Coinbase, it's always taken 168 hours [= 7 days * 24 hours]; you'll finally see your money on the seventh after the time you initiated the deposit or even on the eighth calendar day.

Yes, you can buy crypto using a linked bank account or a credit card on the Coinbase side.
However, there are two premiums that you pay for that convenience.
1. 1.49% fee buying using a bank account and a 3.99% fee using a credit card.  My first purchase was using a credit card.  The fee sucks but I made it back pretty quickly.
2. You pay the exchange rate premium on Coinbase which is higher when you buy and lower when you sell compared to the real-time price on GDAX.

It's always taken seven calendar days for my bank transfers to show up, six if I'm lucky.

@_date: 2017-12-07 01:00:14
Right.  You could try to drive the price down from $15k/market price but you can't drive it down past $0, so you're limited in your profits.  However, if you long bitcoin, there's, theoretically, not an upper limit.

If you log into Coinbase and go to your bitcoin wallet, you should see your outgoing bitcoin transfer.  If you click on the transaction, it'll bring up another page that has the transaction ID along with an external link to live.blockcypher.com.  You can see if your transaction has been confirmed by refreshing this page.

You make good points but there's also the fact that weak hands will sell once they start to see the price drop which will exacerbate the dip.
There are good arguments on both sides on why the price will go up or down once futures trading starts.

It's actually 35% for CME; not sure for Cboe.


Margins will be calculated using CME’s standard benchmarking process for newly-launched contracts. As of December 1, 2017 the estimate of initial margin that CME Clearing would require is 35%, though this is subject to change. Margin offsets with other CME products will not be offered initially. Additionally, FCMs may require a margin level beyond CME Clearing’s minimum requirement.

There are no fees to do a bank transfer into Coinbase or GDAX.  I don't know what wire transfers cost.
You can do a bank transfer into either one.  If you do a bank transfer into Coinbase, depositing into GDAX from Coinbase is free; it only takes a few mouse clicks and is instantaneous.  I've always done a bank transfer into Coinbase and then transferred to GDAX when I want to buy.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:14:52
Kind of ironic that you're paying wire transfer fees and it takes almost as along as an ACH bank transfer.

This is what I'm thinking too.  By selling now, I can lock in my profits.  If the price of bitcoin drops, I can use my profits to buy at the lower price and have even more bitcoin than I had originally.
The downside is if the price actually goes up; I'd have to buy in at the higher price and end up with less bitcoin.

As hard as it is to imagine the price at $100k at the end of 2018, I think the growth rate can continue through next year.
What's even more mind-blowing--the growth in 2018 can exceed 10x due to all the new institutions investing in bitcoin and bitcoin-related products.
How many people were predicting $9k in 2016?  I'm sure it was unbelievable a year ago to most.

I just did this yesterday for the first time.
1. Setup Trezor.
2. Transfer BTC to GDAX.  GDAX will pay the transaction fees for you.  Coinbase won't let you adjust the transaction fees and will use a ridiculous amount.
3. Click Receive on your Trezor to generate an address.
4. Click Withdraw on GDAX and enter in the address.
5. Send a small amount first to test.  I sent $10.00 and waited for a few confirmations to make sure I was doing everything correctly before sending the rest.

I don't understand what you're trying to say here.  You said the simple solution would be to eliminate mining rewards and now you're talking about node operator rewards.  I understand that node operators receive no rewards; they simply have a copy of the blockchain.
My question to you still stands.
Miners are doing calculations in order to be rewarded through new BTC.  Who would mine if there were no rewards?
Do you work for free? No? Then why would you expect anyone to mine for free?

The banks have a lot of money and, hence, the bank lobby has a lot of money.

No. Tether is a crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:57:14
I'm waiting for a dip to buy too.
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:02:50
Not surprised, par for the course for Uber.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:48:20
Great advice.  I paid the 4% credit card fee in order to buy the $6000 dip this weekend.
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:32:10
You can send it to me. :)
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:26:48
I saw the "give gold" feature underneath each comment and clicked on it.  I thought it was a point system but it's actually a paid subscription to reddit that unlocks extra features like no advertisements.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:58:42
That's nice.  I wish I had bought back in September.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:15:13
None. Just hodl.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:57:12
Ah. I was going to ask how you did it.  I tried site:reddit.com in Google but failed there too.
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:03:18
Time to create a hard fork and increase the block size to 1 GB.
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:53:24
Ok. I'm stupid. Carry on.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:30:20
I'm having the same issue transferring USD to GDAX from Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:36:49
There's a new number 1-888-DON-TGAF.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:30:01
Thanks.  I'll give you reddit gold even though I was really searching for the actual post in reddit that had that as the title picture.
I'll still offer reddit gold to anyone else who can find the actual post/thread.
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:35:29
Or, by the time there is a significant dip, the price is higher than it is now because the price hits an ATH soon before.
At the end of October, I was waiting for the price to dip below $5000.  Even with a 30% drop this past weekend, the price only went to $5500.
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:26:23
I haven't used any but I was looking for one today and found Escrow.com.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:55:09
Go to GDAX and choose deposit.  Choose the Coinbase tab and choose the appropriate wallet.
However, there's an issue right now transferring between the two.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:27:29
1. You're not selling bitcoins to a bank; you're selling them to another buyer.  Coinbase and GDAX are exchanges were buyer and sellers meet.
2. Buying and selling on GDAX incurs no fees if you're a book maker i.e. you create limit buy and sell orders.  Otherwise it's .25% if you're a book taker.
When you sell on Coinbase, the fee is 1.49% plus you incur the cost of the exchange rate.  The exchange rate is a premium of 25 to 100 basis points.
For example, bitcoin is selling on Coinbase for $10,000 USD/BTC.  You go to sell 1 BTC on Coinbase.  You will end up selling at the exchange rate which will be $9,900 to $9,980 USD/BTC.




@_date: 2017-11-29 23:44:14
Now I'm getting a message of `Transfers are temporarily paused`. Progress, I guess.
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:47:21
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:40:20
I'm waiting too.
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:32:31
Yup. Hoping day 45 or 50 won't be a dip.
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:54:27
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:38:25
Hopefully, it'll get fixed soon.  Don't want to have to pay the 1.49% fee and the exchange rate buying on Coinbase instead of using GDAX.
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:07:16
I can believe it. I say $50k by the end of 2018.
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:14:40
Good article.  I've seen people talking about LN but never knew what it was.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:30:37
Me too. Also had an alert for $7200.  Either alert would have made me smile.
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:53:30
This too.  During setup, I wrote down the 24-word seed.  I wiped my Trezor and recovered it using the 24-word seed just to see how it's done.
I then wiped my Trezor a second time and set it up a second time.  I recorded a new 24-word seed just in case.  Only after doing this did I send bitcoins to it.
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:50:10
It's good to HODL.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:59:05
Meh.  I don't own any Bitcoin below $5k either. I wouldn't worry about it.  I'm pretty ecstatic actually!
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:46:05
My guess is yes.
Also, Trace Mayer says $26k in February 2018.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:55:49
The funds just cleared today so just under $7200.  Took a week through a Coinbase bank transfer.  I've only used $1000 of it so far.
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:15:21
Also 
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:50:48
Like Bitfinex going bankrupt.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:40:01
Yup.  Reddit gold on the way.  Let me know if you don't get it.
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:19:22
I'm thinking the exact same thing!
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:46:27
GDAX also had the post-only option.

@_date: 2017-11-19 20:36:00
I agree.  What if the government said that buying or selling bitcoin was illegal?  Then the banks would follow suit and deny transfers and wires to any exchanges.
I experienced this first-hand when online poker was outlawed.  Currently, only New Jersey residents can play online.

I might have to start doing this.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:33:35
You're a freaking ninja with reddit.  I just sent you reddit gold for a month.  Let me know if you don't get it.
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:11:04
OP's not talking about why the dip occurred; he's talking about why bitcoin, ethereum, and litecoin's prices all move in concert.
@_date: 2017-11-19 12:23:36
Great Dumb and Dumber reference.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:39:20
History in the making.

Cocaine is a helluva drug.
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:48:23
Yup. Already back over $8k on GDAX.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:47:47
I cashed out $10k in my IRA to put into bitcoin.  You have 60 days to put it back into an IRA with the same investment company or an IRA with a different company.  You can do this once every 365 days.
I figured that chances are good I would make a profit in 45 to 50 days and leave myself enough time to put the money back.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:48:28
Wish I could buy at $6500 right now.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:55:40
Tony knows.
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:40:44
I'd try to sign up for another exchange like Gemini.  Transfer your bitcoins there and try to sell.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:14:31
Looks like you applied as an institution/business.

@_date: 2017-11-19 20:37:52
9k - Nov 27
10k - Dec 29
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:13:32
I don't understand the point of this post.
A $20k drop in one day when bitcoin is $1M is only a 2% change.  A $5k drop in one day when bitcoin is $20k is a 25% change.  In the past, bitcoin has dropped 70% in one day.
Are you trying to say that bitcoin is volatile?
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:11:55
reddit cash then?
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:04:48
Busted through that 200+ BTC sell wall at $9800 like it was nothing.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:59:01
Not sure but I see the same arguments over and over with bcashers:
1. Not Satoshi's original vision
2. has extreme censorship
3. Scaling/block size/da fees!
Only took me a few days of being on both subreddits to figure out which one to choose.
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:27:04
I'll end the contest on that date and choose a winner.  Didn't think it would hit $10k in November.
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:51:16
Yes because math and words.

Very nice work.  However, I noticed that cells E4 through E7 don't have the formula that are in cells E8 through E22.
Also, I can't copy and paste because the sheet is protected.  Anyway you can private message me the password?

His original post reminds me of the scene from Billy Madison.
