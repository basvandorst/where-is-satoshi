To everybody; this is really not the most pertinent question. It's defaulted to the top because of the way this discussion is designed.
And to add insult to injury, basically we are now cut off from any legal options with Tibanne filing countermeasures to ensure no one can file any claim against them. Is this correct?
More importantly, as mentioned further down the discussion; can we ensure the a BTC experpert (possibly one of the core development team) oversee the legal investigations? The Japanese police and legal system are renown for their plodding along and procrastination; relying on confessions (usually bogus) before starting prosecution. 
At this time I think we have no legal recourse; further down the discussion another member states that class action lawsuits were only introduced last year in Japan, and they don't really know how to handle them yet. Is this correct?
It is probable that this will change from a Civil Rehabilitation / Chapter 15.11 corporate case into an actual criminal negligence case against Mark and other members of the Tibanne management. Is this probable from your lawyers' point of view?
As I see it; at this time we have no recourse, until actual charges of criminal negligence/fraud come into play. How do the lawyers think?

Has anyone noticed that Eligius.st mining pool is owned by Tibanne KK and are in the process of transfereing it. Most likely to another company that Mark has set up.

Are these articles relevant to Japanese law?
Remember we are dealing with a Japanese legal system.

As a Japanese resident who had converted nearly all yen to BTC as the market fluctuated; believing in the lie that BTC withdrawals would recommence soon. How does this affect myself and others who would rather have their BTC returned (or a proportion thereof) rather than having it converted to fiat?

This whole debacle reminds me of the Livedoor scandal and consequential prosecution of Takafumi Horie a couple of years ago. (If you're not familiar look both up in Wikipedia.
Also there was a case a while ago, where a Japanese couple got married in Second Life; ended up divorcing in real life and she stole his Second Life holdings, and murdered his avatar. She was prosecuted and incarcerated for virtual theft and murder.
Under Japanese law, there seems to be laws related to the virtual worlds here in Japan and we may need to look into those.
As for the recovery; with the alleged movement of massive amounts of BTCs, recently and in 2011-12 by Mark himself; I believe cyber sleuths can completely track these down and have them returned to their appropriate owners. The actual monies owed will be harder to return.
Also there is a business adage that goes along the lines; Keep as little as possible in writing.
I believe that the database has already been erased and if you don't already have a hard copy of your transaction list, account number, and balances, you won't be able to prove your claim.

wouldn't this be the the same idea that Humint and Goxcoin proposes?

A rollback would harm those that actually speculated and profited on MtGox exchange. Personally a rollback to 2011 would wipe out 90% of my BTC.
