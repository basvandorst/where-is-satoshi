Doesn't coinbase tell you the fee it's set before you send? If so why'd you click confirm 
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:19:46
I just got back from work at 11pm, I started at 7am. Been a needlessly long day 
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:05:15
Revolut to Fire to exchange, easy 
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:30:27
1k isn't really that much in the long run and it could be worth a lot more in time 
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:50:41
fair enough mate, don't blame ya. Was just curious 
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:00:42
why cash it in?
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:34:09
it's safe i have over 3000 btc on it that i mined yesterday 
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:58:06
GDAX if you're sending, as they pay the withdrawal fee
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:25:46
Buy high sell low
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:41:46
don't use shitbase, that might help
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:21:49
I'll have them if you're just gonna waste them
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:55:43
That's hardly anything to the government

+/- £1
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:35:10
great insight 
@_date: 2017-11-24 12:04:00
Send it to the new address the ledger makes. The whole point of the ledger is that the private keys are completely offline and secure. The electrum seed is less secure so why would you put it on the ledger, it'd make it pointless
@_date: 2017-09-03 01:07:32
You send it from your exchange account to your wallet 
@_date: 2017-09-03 00:39:58
An exchange is where you buy and sell cryptocurrency.. A wallet is where you store it.
Once you've bought on an exchange you can keep the Bitcoin on the exchange wallet if you want, but it's more at risk. 
There are other ways of buying BTC without using an exchange 
Breadwallet is open source and simple 
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:19:58
swap the coin to GDAX and widthdraw for free, it's the same login as it's the same company. GDAX pays the fee
@_date: 2017-09-17 23:09:28
It's the same company, so the same login/verification. I didn't have to do anything extra
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:58:29
Transfer it to GDAX which is owned by Coinbase (same login info, the transfer is instant) and you can transfer out for free, as in they pay the fee for you
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:24:59
"can I have free money?"
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:35:45
@_date: 2017-09-03 00:59:08
ye use coinbase mate knock yerself out. Remember to buy high, sell low and never hold
@_date: 2017-09-18 13:28:32

@_date: 2017-09-07 14:42:39

@_date: 2017-09-15 11:50:22
mate that's like £400 overpriced
@_date: 2017-09-12 11:37:52

@_date: 2017-09-29 16:55:56
Very unlikely
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:38:08
there ya go
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:45:05
pretty sure you're meant to sell at a higher price mate
@_date: 2017-09-24 12:53:23
or use GDAX, get 0% / 0.25% fee and free withdrawals to a wallet 
@_date: 2017-09-18 13:29:36
yh u
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:24:46
should have waited a few days my man - more coins 
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:46:59
how about waiting and then selling ya moron
@_date: 2017-09-26 11:54:33
Yeah GDAX pays the fee, no idea why 
@_date: 2017-09-23 22:06:36
couldn't you just use a mobile wallet to get a seed instead of buying a HW if you're not going to be using either 
@_date: 2017-09-19 22:45:44
your pc cpu will do it! Maybe 2 BTC a day if you're lucky haha:~)
@_date: 2017-10-03 11:25:49
The fact that they need to even say it is your first warning sign 
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:46:59
how about waiting and then selling ya moron
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:00:40
is it 1st of October where you live?
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:18:10


aye, steak bakes are better 
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:46:55
you can also reverse transfers easily and so you'll find it hard to buy BTC with paypal
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:45:05
pretty sure you're meant to sell at a higher price mate
@_date: 2017-09-07 10:44:52

@_date: 2017-09-14 00:11:01
@_date: 2017-09-17 23:04:23
you have to transfer the money over to GDAX which is easy
it'll look like this 
@_date: 2017-09-11 13:43:42
Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-09-14 00:12:34
i don't know
@_date: 2017-09-03 00:05:05
Coinbase isn't a wallet, it's an exchange. You don't own the private keys on an exchange. If they get hacked or go bust you're more than likely gonna lose yer coins. 
If you're going to be buying loads, you might wanna look at a hardware wallet. If not, Breadwallet  or similar is good enough 
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:14:28
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:25:44
Mainly by impatient retards that don't know what they're doing. It works fine for me on Android
