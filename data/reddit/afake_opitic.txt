Are websites like bitspend and bitsumo still around? I used bitspend to buy a laptop a year ago.

I'll take it

The odds of finding a block(the only way to make btc whilst mining solo) are tiny. At 800 mh/s, it would take about a year to find a block, if the dificulty doesn't change (which it wont). A pool pays out depending on how much work you did on finding each block they find. Most take a small fee however.

Wow. That's incredible. If they didn't want people saying mean things about them, they should have done better in almost every aspect of their buisness. They have no right to give him a refund without asking him if he wants one first.

Have you tried canadianbitcons.com? Ive used it 3 times with great results.

I understand it, but I also understand that the probability of losing say 6 times in a row is slim(1/64). What if you were to take out whatever you were ahead every 5 wins? I tried the satoshidice breaker ten times with a limit of 3 BTC each, and I reached at least 4 BTC 9 times. Obviously that's a tiny scale, but if I had used real BTC and took out 1BTC every time i reached 4, I would be up about 800$ at the current exchange rate. I understand that the point of the site is that if you keep going for ever, you will eventually lose everything, and I agree with that, but if you're smart and stop when you're ahead, I don't see why it work, for a while anyway. It seems alot "smarter" than plugging quarters into a slot machine. But hey, who am I to say, I'm just a stupid 16 year old interested by a new concept i hadn't heard of.

Couldn't someone enter an adress with a lot of coins in it into one of these programs in order to "hack" it. Why wouldnt this work?
@_date: 2013-03-06 20:17:13
Same as anything: supply and demand. With more and more people wanting to buy BTC, the price rose also.  
@_date: 2013-05-25 21:00:46
Only partially?
@_date: 2013-04-24 01:07:46
if you had access to a lot of money and there were no bet limit, why wouldn't this work. sure you could go on very long losing steaks but when you break that streak, you would get all the money you bet back wouldn't you?

I love how before the crash people were saying that that graph didn't apply to bitcoin because its "unique". Reality's a bitch.

Sorry if I wasn't clear, a 3 BTC bankroll while betting 0.01 BTC every time.

-I could use cash or bank transfer
-not looking to use the coins instantly so if waiting a little longer could save me some money than I can wait
Anonymity isn't super important to me; I don't plan on using the coins for anything sketchy.

If you don't mind a kinda steep fee, Canadianbitcoins.com works well. I've used it thrice without incident.

There is some hope I guess, but a large portion of miners believe butterfly labs to be a scam. They've been pushing back the deliverry date of their products for months now and haven't been to eager to issue refunds...
@_date: 2013-04-05 18:28:14
Ahhh got it, thanks.
@_date: 2013-03-06 21:08:20
Just off the top of my head, there was a new domain renter that accepts BTC and a new website that will allow you to buy anything online by sending them the url and the BTC equivilant of the price.
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:50:50
I jusst did the same thing but with butterflylabs.... at leastyou sent your coins to someone who will most likely refund them :(
