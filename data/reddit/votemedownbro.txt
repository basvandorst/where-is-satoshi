Governments, an extension of humanity, will never allow it.  And even if it did, it won't be in my lifetime.   Case in point: too many people got scared out of European holdings in 2012 because of the crisis in Greece, Italy, Cyprus and what not.  Yet stocks rose from that point. Hope springs eternal in the regulated markets.  That said, I'd buy bitcoins as insurance, but not as an investment, as part of a pure diversification strategy.

I appreciate threads that are geared towards passive observers.  I still cringe at the opportunity cost of "fiat" lost in btc when there is so much to be made in traditional investments.

Index funds win. I turned $10,000 into $6 million using dollar cost averaging and direct depositing into index funds for 2 decades. I am globally diversified and diversified across a lot of traditional asset classes, including residential properties.  I built a fortune just on investing into stock indexes and real estate.  Why do I need to play this kind of volatility?  My take is: If you are here to be part of "history" and are willing to ride this thing down as well as up, then go for it.  Put only a bit in and feel good about being part of the cryptocurrency movement.  If you are using bitcoin or other such new tech to try to get rich, be aware that there are many other ways to make a fortune.  And you will clearly experience opportunity cost when you place that money and make that bet on bitcoin because it is extremely volatile.  Use bitcoin for what it's supposed to be used for (transacting, as a currency) rather than "investing" in it.

Been there, done that.  We all gotta learn the hard way.

In the meantime, my balanced portfolio and stock positions (name any index, it's up), continue to soar.

Nobody knows whether it will be dead or alive in the future. So the pronouncements of btc being dead by the media is irrelevant in any kind of argument.

So far so good... been that way for the last 20 years.  Btw, I don't understand how anyone could think that Bitcoin would be immune to the same stressors as fiat.  If Fiat collapses, so will Bitcoin and the rest of civilization.  Anarchy will reign everywhere and we all best stock up on the basics (guns, ammo, anything for basic sustenance).  If anything, it's the hard assets that will reign supreme when things go to the doghouse: land (go back to farming y'all), maybe gold/silver (that's a maybe if it still means something by then) and weapons.  The electronic world will evaporate and thieves will abound.  The risk will be higher for everything that will lose their credibility as a "store of value". 
Who wants to bet that Bitcoin will be more tightly correlated to Fiat in times of disaster than not?  They're only an alternative instrument during the good times, and only as a pure experimental play for those enamored by the novelty of it.  I would suggest getting off the idealistic bandwagon and stay practical if you truly want to make money.

There's cult like behavior and there's the possible self-interest in manipulating others to try to prop up the price.  So which is it?

Yes, it's called Schadenfreude.

1930 is a far cry from 2014.  Many regulations have been put into place in order to avoid such an eventuality.  Of course, never say never, but that's why I stay completely globally diversified among the main asset classes to spread my bets.  In the end, we can always match portfolios to see who wins. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:05:35
Right. It took me 20 years but I started with $10K and ended with $6 million. How?  Through steady saving, then buying into productive assets such as stocks and real estate.  Started with stock INDEXES while young, then branched off into real estate, then added bonds and eventually a smattering of commodities and precious metals for pure diversification.  No real speculation except for the purpose of hedging but only with traditional diversifiers such as metals and commodities, and only with a very small percentage of my $.  Most of my $ is in stocks/real estate/bonds.

Where have you been?  The market's up and recovered big time since 2008.  
@_date: 2015-01-17 03:26:41
Taxes are mostly deferred in IRAs, SEP IRAs, 401Ks of which we have many.  So no, we don't "continually" lose 15% to taxes... at least not now.  There are many ways to shelter taxes as well, ~~of which I am well versed about~~ which we should all be well versed about.
@_date: 2015-01-17 00:07:43
I do not believe that $10K along with steady saving into ONE speculative idea, most especially a currency of any sort would have yielded anything close, no matter how much money you put into it.  Currency is not a productive asset.  I happened to be shrewd enough to parlay $10K and additional savings into investments that DID increase in value over time mainly because they are mostly productive assets, plus the fact that I maintained both an offense and defense when it came to managing a portfolio.

Didn't I say I had a healthy dual income household?  Didn't I say I was very frugal and saved prodigiously throughout the years?  Plus the fact that I am very fiscally adept, both in business and in financial matters, in general.  My point is that it is doable even with nothing but a regular salary, a spouse who has the same goals and by NOT making any stupid mistakes while you're at it.  It is easy to lose and fritter away your future on stupid things -- both in the realm of consumption and in the realm of speculative gambles.  That was my point.  Returns are what they are over time.  The fact is, one must be patient, industrious and wise overall to turn practically nothing into something.  The point is, you don't have to be incredibly lucky to do so and you don't have to take stupid gambles like day trading, heavy leverage, margin, options, forex or dabbling in esoteric currencies.  Even if you can manage half of my income or a third, you'd be a resounding success.  So if you can safely say you earn a third of what I ever did over 20 years, and you did what I did with THAT money, you'd be sitting on $2 mill right now.
@_date: 2015-01-16 23:51:05
Not lying. I said I started with $10K but ended up with $6 million.  How?  By saving a lot of what I earned.  It includes savings over the years that were prudently invested in a diversified portfolio.  I did not say that the $10K was the first and last investment made.  My bad if I did not explain that correctly.
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:00:09
You forgot reinvested dividends, which figures heavily into compound interest and demonstrates the true power of compounding (for an investment).  You need to calculate actual Total Return.  It's much higher than that.
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:53:25
Not really.  I only had to work around 20 years at a good job to be able to retire early and enjoy the rest of my life.  In my 40s, I've got 4 rentals in total purchased over time, a massive, diversified investment portfolio and run a few businesses.  I don't really like to speculate so I avoid "get rich quick" schemes.  I'd rather go for the sure thing that I know will pay off down the road with the best odds -- that would be the stock market index (US and international).  One of the most important things I learned early is that everything has an opportunity cost.  And avoiding losses should be more important than chasing winners.
@_date: 2015-01-17 00:43:11
How do you arrive at a $6 million net worth?  Let me count the ways.... and not one of it is Bitcoin.  I did not come into this "wealthy" as you keep implying -- I already explained how I got to that final number. I happened to scrimp heavily very early on and made a decent sized salary and had held $0 debt except for mortgages.  
You're obviously fixating over amounts here when the matter in question is speculating in bitcoin.  You haven't even answered my question of whether you'd dollar cost average all your savings into bitcoin from now until eternity.  Let's see where that leads you.
@_date: 2015-01-17 00:17:04
Real estate here adds a lot to the mix.  My household also does produce enough income to allow for discretionary savings that are invested wisely.  The point is wise investment... you are fixated on the amounts achieved.  However, I am trying to point out the importance of steady, consistent saving and investing in appropriate vehicles.  We also started out very very frugal and we went with many ridiculous sacrifices (relative to the income we make).  But today, it's been early retirement all the way and fun times ahead.  Let me ask you this: would you put your kids' college funds into bitcoin?  I put in $40K for my children and used rewards cards that fed into 529 accounts for the past decade. No more additional input but for that $40K (the rewards cash back did the rest).  And we are on track to have college fully paid for by the time they need the funds. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 23:59:32
Not to that extent.  I did a lot of major scores over the 90s and the late 2000s all the while diversifying our investments.  I would never purchase into a currency though, thinking that THAT was an investment.  Then again, I hold a small bit in precious metals/commodities, again for diversification.  The point is that the bulk of my portfolio is in standard equities/ bonds/ real estate (and a lot are in just plain jane indexes).  Now try steady saving into bitcoin and see where THAT gets you. I doubt very much it would end up so fortuitous for you.
@_date: 2015-01-17 04:17:03
I gave you my personal case study, so read into it what you will.  There is certainly some element of luck involved but you want to take reasonable risks in general.  I would personally spend more of my time worrying about how to increase income and how to build businesses whilst deploying discretionary income into wise investments.  A little bit of everything can get you far, with the proper prioritization of your energies and efforts.  Spending time nit picking and trading bitcoin is not one's way to wealth.  Spending time making wise and prudent financial and business choices is.  And yes, $30,000 is not going to get you anywhere close to several million.  You'd have to figure out ways to build that income up.  It's just unfortunate that many people think that bitcoin is going to make them wealthy someday.  
I also find it interesting how you really latched on to numbers here.  I'm actually an intuitive investor.  I don't fuss with numeric details and rely more on behavioral psychology and fundamentals to assess investment prospects.  I'm not a serious technician at all (although I employ a bit of technical analysis), and make calls based on sentiment, demographics and fundamental valuation.  I doubt very much you know more about investments than I do, unless of course you can match me dollar for dollar and year over year in experience.
And if you do, then good for you.
@_date: 2015-01-16 23:53:15
Full of what?  My case is not impossible to do if you have a decent savings rate and a well rounded portfolio and a little luck.  I didn't clarify myself completely -- I meant to say that I started with $10K but added steady savings over time to reach a mid 7 figure net worth.  It helps if you are dual income as well.  But that is the truth. One example of how this worked out for us is that I purchased 3 rentals between 2010 and 2011 in areas in California that were hardest hit by the 2008 housing crash.  Collective equity in those homes is around $1.5 mill which is mostly profit at this time.
@_date: 2015-01-17 00:21:37
TL;DR  A high net worth is not the result of one thing but the result of many little things that make a difference.  Yes, I made a fortune doing a series of small things over time to get where I am, and that is my point precisely.  As they say, one CAN "get rich slowly".
