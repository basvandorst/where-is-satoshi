Oh. So I didn't deliberately change the prices to change the punchline from Bitcoin's volatility to Bitcoins unquestionable strength ������

Thanks mate ��

You're being obstreperous on purpose. I've provided a reasonable explanation and expressed my truthful intentions.
I'm not interested in karma, I'm interested in rebutting their joke.

I didn't get called out. Another commenter in that post, posted the link and I thanked him.

I'm about to repost this again since it got got banned for linking a non np link.
Find me in my next post bro

Oh bro. You never understood the original post, which is making fun of BTC's volatility, the price increases marginally and then decreases marginally. This is done to laugh at the notion that Bitcoin is a currency yet doesn't have a stable value.
Also, **this post relies on the fact that people have seen the original** otherwise it wouldn't be funny. Bc I'm repurposing the volatility shtick by hammering home how strong and unquestionably solid XBT is. I didn't reference it in the post bc 
a) it was gilded and on r/all so it received a lot of attention 
b) having to explain the joke kills it and insults your audience - something your ignorance has forced me to do.

Sanity prevails.

I made reference to that joke. **I deliberately changed the joke**. 
Take a look, the prices are different, I'm not salty you're stunted.

Now hurry up before I change my mind and keep that $2835
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:17:36
Lol. It's clearly a reference.

Here's the anti-BTC [original post](
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:30:24
Everyone follows advice: 
BTC Crash 2040/01/01
Everyone sneaks advice by a year to avoid crash:
BTC Crash 2039/01/01
Everyone sneaks previous sneak:
BTC Crash 2038/01/01
Repeat forever until it's crashing 10 minutes from now. Great job ����

No. I included your link to let people know what the original one was and got banned for posting a non np link

Pride comes before a fall.
This wanton gloating does nothing to further the goals of BTC. 
Stop the pretty-boy gloating, keep introducing others into the community and stay eternally vigilant.
