Thanks for the chart, it explains well. Would you recommend cloud mining other crypto currencies such as Dash or Ethereum etc?

I understand the potential growth of bitcoins. But people are generally looking towards the accessible profits along the way with the initial investment. Buying a bitcoin for $4500 now and get paid another $4500 at the end of 2 years is attractive, but putting $4500 in mining, breaking even after 6 months and the rest of the it will be profits sounds much more appealing to most people, including me. *Putting aside profit depreciation from mining. But I'm trying to prove myself wrong here as I am very tempted to purchase mining contracts myself rather than buying BitCoins, which I should be doing :(

I read somewhere about upgrading hashpower every now and then too. Upgrading hashpower allows the profit to be stable, or does it have in other areas too? What will happen if my hashpower stays stagnant for several months?

But there are so many people getting payouts from cloud mining. I understand that referrals plays a huge part. But it doesn't mean without any referrals we don't get any payout / payout decreases exponentially so much so that we can't get back the investment, which in my case, only requires 5 to 6 months, right? Or am I wrong :O

I've thought about it too. But I'm thinking that they might have a finite capital. By selling contracts, they can purchase more mining equipment. From there, they take a certain % of profits made from the equipment purchased with our money. In a sense they are using our investment to earn more. At the end of the day, they are still the sole  winner because they are able to earn more using our money without using additional funds from their side, and they own all the machines after our contract ends.

I am aware of the maintenance fees involved. I am looking into Dash or Eth mining as well as they don't require maintenance fees. But at the price of a lower payout compared to BitCoin
