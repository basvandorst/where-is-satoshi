Indeed, what's happening in Auckland and BTC?

About time these fraudulent prats were annihilated...and sites should start removing their adverts for a "wallet" service; I mean who would trust these unscrupulous Swedes?!!
Their continued arrogance - in not honoring refunds, in the face of raising further venture capital, is totally despicable.

These are indeed cool. One for every post office throughout the land!

About time these guys had a BTC bounty put on their heads!

Indeed, I agree with you guys that have lost out here; we have likewise been waiting, and waiting, and talking with lawyers, seeking additional resources to get our rightfully refundable money returned on a considerable order - with no product delivered (Neptunes).
So, for the record, these are the ratbags supposedly running this company:  
The founders of KnCMiner:
Andreas Kennemar
Johan Rilegård
                          
Marcus Erlandsson
            
Michael Unnebäck
Sam Cole
Additionally, we contacted the VC behind the recent fundraising; amazing that they closed $14mill through this company.
They stated that ALL refund commitments would be met. He also stated this fact via a WSJ article on the funding of KnC.

Likewise...waiting over a week for a reply from Coinbase.

Here is a great list:
Over 12,000 businesses and charities accept bitcoin with BitPay.

Has anyone else had issues integrating the BitPay API key into Shopify? We're still waiting for an effective help desk answer after 2 days of having a ticket lodged.
And something to note in certain categories...BitPay will take 1% of a sale and limit a total volume to $100/day (wine)...so we can only sell 1-2 bottles per day - that's crazy!

We're with Shopify and just going through the process but have got stuck after registering and agreeing to BitPay terms. The API as collected from Shopify has been pasted into the key space at BitPay...but gets the "Ooopps" page on BitPay.
Any help appreciated from those who have implemented these cool stores...as of yesterday :-)
