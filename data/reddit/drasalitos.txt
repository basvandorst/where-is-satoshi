But what happens if BTC would die, where does BCH gets the code from? ��
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:48:21
As I just read they dont support germany
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:17:34
By telling reddit this won't be possible for long. Just shut up and enjoy��‍♂️

I dont know, but by telling the world, you could easily destroy any arbitrage opportunities. Just keep quiet and earn your money.
(Some idiot posted an arbitrage trading opportunity I also used for some trades and after that it was gone very quickly)
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:07:55
If I buy, it crashes
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:33:57
But why is this happening? Is this because the idiots stopped spamming ?
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:51:46
If you can use both exchanges, just do it.
By telling the world, arbitrage will disappear
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:16:17
I don't know if I am stupid, but the Maker doesn't pay any fee, but the Taker does pay 0,25%. There must always be a Taker when Bitcoin changed the owner. So on every trade, GDAX/Coinbase is collecting fees.
This isn't a lot of money on the first sight, but if you look at the daily volume (approx 29k Bitcoins) this would make around 1M USD every day (assuming the current price of 14150USD per BTC).
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:40:52
But if I put a limit order into the orderbook for below/above the current price, who can buy it? It is impossible to put buy limit orders above the price and vice versa.
I think if someone makes an Market order, he gets the next best price, e.g. if he buys, he gets the cheapest position in the order book. 
So he takes the current market price. 
If everybody only makes limit orders, nobody would buy/sell bitcoins
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:15:53
You may just stopped yourself by telling the internet��‍♂️
If there is such an opportunity you shouldnt post, just keep arbitraging the shit out of it and shut the fuck up until it doesn't work anymore
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:44:57
Depends on your personal income tax rate. It can go up to 45%.
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:31:01
still faster than the shit exchange kraken
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:29:55
Too late I fear.
On the other hand, slow transactions could save btc by stopping more panic selling
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:29:28
I'm also a german citizen, I also traded and withdrew on gdax.
But as I just found out today, Germany is not in the list of the supported countries:
I fear, that they someday just freeze my account.

Missing XRB, once it is in big exchange it'll fly

Would it be good if miners stop mining?
@_date: 2018-09-06 05:56:41
I thought everybody wanted the institutional money in
@_date: 2018-09-19 05:15:46
He wants us to HODL his bags.
@_date: 2018-08-30 11:15:44
Yes, we should spend more Bitcoin. No hodl only
@_date: 2018-05-18 06:38:34
Because it says up?
@_date: 2018-08-26 09:00:05
At least in Germany it is not complete free, I had to pay 10€ per day when I had a nasty ellbow dislocation. 
However, a surgery was done, which would've cost waaaay more than my total bill of only 100€ for the stay.
But I guess if a pensioner is often in hospital it can become costly, too. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:36:42
They buy the cheap bitcoins in order to sell them later for profit.
@_date: 2018-05-20 15:13:27
What are the clues so far?
@_date: 2018-05-13 23:31:41
And that's why he will never drive lambo, he hodls bitcoin and eventually one day he dies because too much stress seeing the price action ��
@_date: 2019-03-20 09:11:21
This looks too inconvenient to me.
Just look at apple pay, double tap on the side, boom, done
@_date: 2018-06-11 11:53:14
They are saying hodl4eva so that they can dump their bags on you
@_date: 2018-06-12 18:32:21
Merchants hodling would be stupid gambling for them
@_date: 2019-02-17 14:10:03
This would be fucking amazing.
More time to buy.
If it is for me, this market can stay like this for 5 yrs. i would have no problems with this
@_date: 2019-02-17 17:35:29
Yeah, you will never know. 
But since I have not as many bitcoin as I want to rn, I would also love cheaper entry
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:16:14
I hope you are right
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:44:19
Did you really tipped him 0.5 BTC? Shit I am jealous haha.
How does this work?
@_date: 2019-02-26 06:27:55
2 yrs 4k would be a dream. 
Dont know why so many complains
@_date: 2019-02-25 20:50:42
Yeah better hodl only the cryptocurrency
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:49:34
i hope a huge dip
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:40:34
absolutely 
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:53:07
I am student too and would never take a loan to buy bitcoins.
Thus I only have approx. 0.1 BTC which I bought with money I already "wrote off".
Don't be stupid my friend
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:33:47
I regret, that I jumped in so late  But I would've been this guy, I would never be happy again :( 
Poor guy
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:11:09
However I think even if you have Bitcoins worth millions of dollars, it would be pretty hard to divest and get the fiat.
(Unfortunately we still need fiat to pay)
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:38:24
As far as I know they have an Rest-API, should be easy to build some JavaScript tool to fetch the data and write to an excel file in real time.
Do you have any coding experience?
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:38:25
I hope soon, I want to buy some more
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:28:42
As soon as the profit would be enough to buy a lambo
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:13:35
Better than nothing ��
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:41:08
Just out of curiosity, how much do you gain in lets say 24h?  I think anything above +2% or +3% would be fucking awesome
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:21:52
Why? (I honestly dont know, I am new to BTC)
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:18:10
I hope 5k, I want to buy more, but I have no money right now
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:31:35
I think this is it. Gdax stops the drop. Picking up some nice arbitrage opportunities before it is over
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:42:28
What is this
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:16:01
you just missed the dip
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:13:09
What app are you using?
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:51:52
I bought with 35€ (just a poor Student)  Now I own nearly 0,1 BTC in total. I hope it will be enough for a lambo. Any chance? :D
@_date: 2018-11-18 15:22:28
An angry robot
@_date: 2019-01-06 17:51:33
No my friend Wall Street bonuses are paid earlier this year
@_date: 2019-01-13 10:38:43
Problem for me is tax bullshit if I spend BTC :( 
Else I would use BTC
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:34:11
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:25:23
No he should FOMO buy . Just tell him to hodl. We need more money to enter the market
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:39:05
There is a whale with a $100M short. Most likely he is trying to prevent his short from liquidating. 
@_date: 2018-07-14 06:36:34
However he didn't hodl but dump his bags on hodlers to get the tesla
@_date: 2018-07-30 06:23:09
So basically better never use a cryptoCURRENCY as a currency? We need more guys buying stuff with bitcoin
@_date: 2018-07-15 17:49:13
Only a few use it though. Many just hodl to get rich
@_date: 2018-04-19 20:42:36
My credit card does it instantly and I don't have to pay the fee at all. 
(+ I can use it to buy at McDonalds, grocery store ...) 
I hope btc picks up on adoption, and that there will be more actual users instead of hardcore hodler
@_date: 2018-04-09 23:03:18
Problem is, every hodler assumes that TA believers think: TA = 100% prediction. But TA only increases odds, smart traders use stops 
@_date: 2018-04-09 10:23:10
Ah come on, I am from Cologne and  I saw how a german guy (blonde and blue eyes, one can call him a typical "aryan") tried to rape a drunk girl on the 11th Nov (dunno if you are into this, but in cologne this is a big day). We (were a group of 5) stopped this bastard and delivered him to the police.
Point is, not only refugees do shit like this, germans do, too. Difference is, that press randomly reports if a german guy is involved. But then again many only blame "the rapist refugees raping every girl"
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:34:25
What if they are shorting? 
Whales dont need moon to buy lambo with fiat
@_date: 2018-04-09 10:24:30
I believe this once I can use Crypto to pay rent, buy food and enjoy my beer in a pub without any tax bullshit.
@_date: 2018-04-09 21:10:27
I hope so! 
But in my case (Germany) I fear, that it will take LONG time. 
Even credit cards aren't really adopted, a lot of people still insist on cash. 
But only time will tell. My second fear is the hodl mentality. Even if stores accept BTC,  are there people who are willing to spend their precious BTC?
@_date: 2018-04-09 10:28:08
Tax evasion is punished pretty harsh in Germany, better safe than sorry ��
@_date: 2018-04-24 06:24:21
I'd say 10k, that was the resistance we failed to break some weeks ago + psychological effects of 5 digits 
@_date: 2018-04-09 22:59:14
TA is no 100% guarantee on gains. But tbh some nice support and resistance line will increase your chance on gaining.
What is likely to happen  after we failed to push through twice?
Short  and put a stop loss  is very good idea imo.
Same with  and 9,9k, putting a short around there with a stop above will give you nice chances on gaining! It's all about having higher chance to gain than to lose.
But this is only my noob TA opinion, which helped me to double my btc amount. But who am I talking to? Only hodl seem to be correct over here
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:27:42
Idk, even famous guys like Uli Hoeneß got caught and thrown into jail. Even with the bonus of beeing famous.
Yes my gains are much much smaller, but then again I am still pretty young, about to finish college and don't want to risk anything and maybe regret this shit until I am about to die.
Imo, better declare everything and pay taxes on the gains.
But this is just my opinion, I am kinda like a coward in this regard
@_date: 2018-04-09 23:00:56
+ you are a fool if you put no stops
@_date: 2018-04-09 10:29:28
But this doesn't matter. Crypto is kinda like speculation only, never run into any shop where I can pay with crypto, so tax on using crypto is only hypothetical rn
@_date: 2018-04-08 17:04:49
But but, if no fluctuation from now on, no lambo for me ��
@_date: 2018-04-07 18:03:51
Ah come on, those weak hands who sold the 17k bounce are the real winners rn. Give me down votes if you like, but if I was not tricked by hodl memes but instead used my head I either would drive lambo or at least have 3x the amount of bitcoins.
Furthermore, if everybody hodls for ever, when does one even get a lambo? 
@_date: 2019-05-01 06:43:16
We are holding his bags
@_date: 2019-05-14 10:10:18
Do this with Dec 2017 and Dec 2018
