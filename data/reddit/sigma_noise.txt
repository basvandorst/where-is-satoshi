Thanks for the response. Step 15 is signing the hash of the entire transaction structure though, which includes the other inputs...
Is the idea that all the inputs are filled with the temporary signature, then the entire structure is signed by each private key, then each temporary signature is replaced with the appropriate new one?

You raise a very interesting thought. What will the aggregate effect of all the altcoins be on bitcoin?More generally stated, can one *coin stand out against the sum of the others?
My thought is that, overall, the digital currency universe will be a winner-takes-all, or a 'mob-mentality' type of system, and time will only reinforce this. Whether the 'winner' is bitcoin, or some other coin. The fluidity of exchange between the various altcoins (non-'winner'-coins) will never be so great that they can act as a single unified counter-force against the 'winner'.
@_date: 2014-05-30 18:33:57

@_date: 2014-04-18 16:17:42
Seeing how the difficulty has only been increasing, any block rate adjustment from that would cause the average block time to INcrease, not DEcrease.

Very cool! 
If the images could be scaled down to be business card sized, people could easily carry the component keys with them in their wallets. Maybe they could be made out of 1/16th inch stainless steel, with square holes where the QRcode is 'white'. You could then stack the two (or more) QRcodes on top of each other to reveal the key.
If the resulting key was BIP-38, then there would be multiple levels of security.

What? The green line (hash rate) and the red line (difficulty) are in different units, so they cannot meaningfully be compared against each other... with charts like this you look at the CHANGE in one dataset and compare it with the CHANGE in the other dataset. Did changes occur at the same time, or are they somehow correlated?
Anyways, the grey line, which I take the be the line with the least averaging applied, shows a big change close the MIDDLE of the period between two changes in difficulty. I'm not sure what can be made of this chart.

If some government, or other entity, decided to start buying up all the bitcoin they could, it would just drive the price up. 
Having the 'most' bitcoin of anyone wouldn't' give them any special power, or allow them to do anything to permanently damage bitcoin. Probably the only damaging thing they could do would be to slowly accumulate lots of bitcoin, and then quickly release it onto the martket, for cheap, all at once, causing the price to crater under the excessive supply
@_date: 2014-06-19 17:00:51
Not able to help your exact question, but you could also accomplish something similar where one of the keys needed for a 2-of-2 type transaction/address (for example) is secured in some date-aware encryption scheme. Maybe you could also use the blockchain height, but that would rely on average block generation rate being known or relatively fixed.. which may be dangerous.
Perhaps that service could be something your company provides. That service alone would be incredibly useful for lots of different people.
@_date: 2014-02-03 18:54:44

Interesting. Any write ups on Stallman's thoughts on bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-10-02 18:23:14
Look at it this way: if you change the scale of the the red trace, but NOT the other traces (all other traces have the same units), then your observation is no longer true. For instance, change the vertical plot range of the red data from 2^10 to 3.5^10, to 2^10 to 7^10, twice as big of a range. In this case now the red line would ALWAYS below the green line.
Bottom line: they are in different units, so any absolute comparison between the traces is meaningless.

How do you determine that it was overpriced? Neither you, nor anyone else claiming to know the 'real' value of bitcoin, is doing anything but guessing.

Majority hash power is the name of the game.. that means that LOTS of people won't get what they want, but most will.. but that is the cost of participating in the system. Right now majority hash power is running the core build, and the big blockers are upset... soon the tables may turn and reverse that situation, or maybe not...

There are some people here that think Venezuela is past the point where bitcoin will help, but frankly, every penny that Venezuelans can convert into BTC is money that won't evaporate out of their hands due to inflation.

They CAN, but they never would, just like no one will ever be incentivized to run software that issues more than 21M bitcoin. It would be counter the selfish interests of the miner.

Your story is... interesting.
However, majority rules is the name of the game, whether you like it or not. The majority, in this case, is referring to hashing power. To paraphrase the white paper '1 CPU = 1 Vote'. The concept (software/rules/etc) with the most votes wins.
If at some point you decide that the last mined block was done with software you don't agree with, you are free to continue mining off the last block you did 'agree with'.... but the blockchain will continue on.
I say all this not supporting big blocks, or small blocks, or BIP whatever. Its just the way it works.

My only comment is from an economic perspective. It is basic supply and demand theory that if suddenly LOTS more people have more income to spend, the prices of basic good and services that are most commonly consumed WILL go up. No gorging needed. This is just a fact. I'm not saying its good or bad, or right or wrong.

Do NOT lose faith! There is no reason to think that the growth of bitcoin would be roses and lollipops. There is significant money involved now, and people have a lot more on the line than when 1 BTC was less than $1 USD. It's understandable that opinions are starting to clash.
The amazing thing about bitcoin is that there is nothing that it SHOULD be. It's evolving. People vote on what they want it to be by choosing which SW build they run. If the consensus of what bitcoin is diverges too much from what people like, everything will adjust as new SW mods are introduced and run by the masses. That is exactly what we are seeing happen now with XT/BIP101. Whether people call THAT bitcoin is semantics. Everything is fluid and dynamic. If someone wants to make a bigger leap and invent a new 'coin' that has all kinds of great new properties, and THAT becomes the most popular crypto currency, then great!
Bitcoin evolves to best serve greatest number of people. Its constantly optimizing. 
This process is beautiful in that what bitcoin becomes is shaped by market forces, and what serves people the best. ANYONE can contribute ideas into the ecosystem.
Nothing like bitcoin has ever existed, and quite simply the cat is out of the bag.

I agree it's a subtle distinction.
As long as this is how the POW works, I'm not convinced ASICBOOST a 'bad' thing. How is materially different than moving to a smaller die dimension and increasing efficiency that way? The miners and ASIC manufacturers are working in their own best interest. This is competition. 
That being said, from a larger perspective, I agree that the concentration of mining power in an ever-smaller number of hands is a concerning development.

The problem with using bitcoin is that, 1) you still need to convert it to fiat at some point. 2) taking bitcoin for a dispensary (aka, processing their payments) gets really dicey. The feds still consider cannabis illegal. If you knowingly process transactions for illegal products, you can get charged with money laundering. If the dispensary loses their license, sells to an underage kid, starts skirting the law themselves, even without your (their payment processor's knowledge), can get hit HARD. Up to 20 years in prison. That is no joke.
The feds 'say' that they are getting more lenient on cannabis payment processing, but that could all change when a new administration is in the White House. There need to be LAWS passed that make the situation clearer before payment processors will get involved. There is just too much at risk.

This is not quite correct. The difficulty of solving a block is not proportional to the number of other miners currently mining. It's proportional to the current network difficultly level. 
If tons of miners suddenly turned off their hardware, the chance that Joe-bob's mining rig solves a block doesn't change. However, the time between blocks WILL change. As the time between blocks goes up the the difficulty will be reduced accordingly at the defined intervals to restore the ~10 minute block time.

Spread is the price difference between what people selling bitcoin want for it, and what people buying bitcoin are willing to pay. Its a general financial term, not specific to bitcoin.

Credit/Debit card transactions are inherently a 'pull' transaction. You give merchants all the info they need to take money from you, and just trust they only take what they said they would.
Bitcoin is inherently a 'push' transaction. You send only the amount you want to send. The information you transmit is not able to be used later to get more money from you.

I've been thinking about something similar recently and determined that in a lot of ways it is directly contradictory to the anonymity of bitcoin, and therefore, bad. I started thinking about it in regards to someone wanting to lend a large amount of bitcoins to a particular person or address. In a traditional system the willingness to lend, and predicted ability of the borrower to repay the principle, is based on a mutually agreed on system of credit ratings. Lots of information about an individual is compiled and used to determine credit-worthiness. It seems like this is the sort of function you are aiming to fill in the bitcoin world. Despite the anonymity of a particular ID, a lot can be determined from the network formed by the 'trust links' between the IDs. Additionally, what is stopping people from buying and selling 'trusted' IDs?

Yes, it is. The number of bitcoins that will ever exists is 21 million. The number of pieces a single bitcoin can be *divided* into is NOT finite, however.

Can you highlight what you think some of the hurdles are?
@_date: 2013-05-01 21:10:03
I'm not involved in this situation, and don't want to be, but it sounds like the first thing to do would be to make a list with real names, addresses, phone numbers, etc of everyone impacted that wants to pursue legal action. Get an idea of the magnitude of the situation, the number of parties involved as well as the amount of $$. Take THAT to a lawyer and see what they say ...Just my two sense on how to get organized and keep pushing forward.

For the sake of the discussion, can you provide some reasons why you believe this to be true?

What do I get for my money? Equity in the company? A percentage of the fees received? Both?
What license requires the 'networth' of $500k? 
How much did you get in your previous fundraising? Why did you run out before the ATM was operational? Are those investors not willing to put up more?
What are your credentials and backgrounds?

Serious answer: No. That is not knowable.

Follow-on question: If miners choose which transactions to put into the block they process, how can a consensus ever form? Wouldn't everyone be computing hashes for blocks made up of different transactions?

Don't sell. Spend.

I like the thinking overall, but step 6 is were it gets scary. How is the 'random guy' vetted? Who would be willing to use an account with their personal info attached as an 'exit node' to the world of fiat? The receipt and dispersal of fiat needs to be decentralized somehow... that's where my thinking gets stuck.....

I agree that a charity's address is the best idea.. it will be a good example of how easy bitcoin can make sending money, and it will be a 'good cause'.
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:48:47
I hope by then it's more stable than that. In a 'normal' asset a 10% drop is a big deal.

Let's put the knee-jerk reaction on pause for a second, and ask how often does this approach lead to a review? It looks like TONS of other issues received a similar fate....

It would be worth about 7...

Bitcoin credit card: A card with a magnetic stripe that would contain your wallet info and could be written/rewritten after a transaction. Correspondingly merchants would need a bitcoin card reader device with appropriate SW behind it.
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:59:59
Well, the converse argument against inflationary currency is that no one will sell anything today because they can get more for it tomorrow, in a week, etc. Clearly that doesn't happen. Once the bitcoin price stabilizes more, and it becomes more widely accepted, hoarding will decrease, and spending will increase.
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:39:23


this part is not a given

How we know what the price was at our time of purchase?

The comments in that twitter feed are painfully stupid....
@_date: 2013-05-01 23:45:45
Very cool, indeed. However, once it gets added to another wallet that already has bitcoin in it the traceability is lost, it seems.
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:26:46
This is good!!!
@_date: 2013-10-15 13:06:44
This is a quote from someone here on or bitcointalk, they should be given credit on that image... Just sayin
@_date: 2013-11-23 22:49:15
Would the idea be to spread awareness? Maybe everyone could buy BTC at the door, then use them throughout the night to buy drinks, food, etc....

People are giving lots of creative and layout advice, which is good. But in, general I think your idea is great. The community needs a simple 'snapshot' document like this to quickly and clearly explain Bitcoin to newcomers

hmm, after reading your post, the conclusion I come up with is different: 'the *value* of money *comes* from the history of trade.
when you say 'the purpose of money is to *store* the history of trade' something doesn't sit right in my head..
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:05:02
Charting and other technical analysis is total bullshit. Might as well use a coin flip to guide your decisions...
@_date: 2013-11-06 03:37:03
Shit man, I've been excited for quite a while now!
@_date: 2013-04-27 00:39:47
Only invest money you are completely willing to lose. The success of bitcoin is far, far, far from certain.
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:35:13

The average Chinese person doesn't have the ability to invest in equities like people in the US do (I can't speak for other countries). They are searching for places to invest money. Well, that's what I read on the internet.

Lots of people are suggesting switching to a thin client... but isn't the point the protocol that there are millions of copies of the block chain in existence? If everyone switches to thin clients won't that reduce the number of full blockchain copies in existence?
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:32:12
Adding more decimal places doesn't add bitcoins to the economy, it just allows for smaller division of the ones that already exist. 
QE involves the government buying bonds with money that they just 'create', which is the same thing as adding to the total supply of money.

Definitely. Irreversibility cannot be added as a higher 'layer' the way a guarantee can. It's got to be woven in at the most basic level.

..Do we really need another post about this?
@_date: 2013-04-22 16:45:08
Where can I get a mathematical, and technical explanation of how bitcoins are 'kept' in a wallet? How is 7.8956 bitcoins, for example, represented in a transaction?
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:50:22
Thanks for posting. These kinds of discussions are great.
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:01:03
I think it also had to do with details and limits of floating-point number storage in computers...
@_date: 2013-04-26 17:59:29
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:47:25
hold on.. this chart just shows that a lot of addresses have a small amount of BTC in them... in reality almost everyone has *multiple* addresses, so until those can be grouped and summed, this data is essentially meaningless.
