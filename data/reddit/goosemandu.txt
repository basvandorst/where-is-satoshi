You made some great points. The only reason I included it is bc it is in top 3 most popular/well know currencies right now. The average person doesn't know much about cryptos but have at least heard of Bitcoin. Once they do a little research they will see Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin most frequently. As cryptos as a whole progress I agree with you, the technology is lacking a bit relative to BTC and LTC and ETC will taper. That's just my opinion, but for time being I see it doing somewhat well in near future.

Turn down for what?
@_date: 2017-09-25 15:08:15
That's crazy. What does that mean exactly?

Thanks for the info. Btw, what does a sugar free browny taste like?

You think it will dip further down on the 30th? I'm weighing possibility to sell and buy back in at lower price.

No need for a link, you pretty much summed it up. I was backing you up bud. USA!

Man I can imagine, bitter as hay haha.
If you want a new account go for it! Forget all the Karma, it doesn't matter anyway

Thanks for the blunt advice. To the point. Are you going to sell before the 30th and buy in after? Or ride it out.

The spike in BTC was likely as a result of this news. And I had eggs and toast for breakfast with a glass of OJ.

In the end I think Litecoin, Ethereum and Bitcoin will still remain important. Even though you mentioned this news could be from switching from other cryptos to BTC
