I totally agree with you.
See what happened with Alpha and Finobbacci. They created loads of unhappy customers. We need reliable companies.

I think that GAW have no real competitor at the time!
Maybe Zeus would be the next big thing, hopefully.
It is good to have options and competition.

Profitability has to do with a lot of things. Many people expect the LTC price to rise significantly till the end of the year, but this is a prediction (as most things in crypto world).
For everybody looking for an entry point in crypto or for a smooth cloud mining contract I think that Zeus is one of the best options, if not the best. I have used it and I highly recommend it. Transparent company, a company with a real presence that is also a manufacturer, with a great track record and very helpful service department.

I think that the most difficult part is to find a respectable cloud-mining company. This is one of the most difficult tasks.
Profitability on the other hand is based on other factors (coin prices/selections) which are mostly unpredictable.

I also think that anyone should start small in any new field that he does not know how it works. Mining has to be fun also. It is highly unlikely that you will become rich from mining and/or altcoins (unless you are a whale with loads of cash). So starting small is a nice way to know the field. And cloudmining an even more easier way of entering mining.

We are waiting for the new surprises that Zeus will have for us. We will stay tuned!

Look at their latest announcement of Zeus! (
ZeusHash price has now been announced $16 per Mh/s for 12 months contract!
I think that these are very good news for all miners/crypto fans.
GAW will now have to compete with ZEUS and it may be difficult to match ZEUS since ZEUS is also a manufacturer which is a great advantage!

I have great faith in Zeus. It turned out that it is more trusted than other European (see KNC and their latest feat:  and American companies (I have personal bad experience from an American Asics miners provider).
