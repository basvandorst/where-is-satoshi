Do you think they bail out banks in free markets?  
Statism is a fucking religion.

Government numbers :/ as trusty as healthcare in Cuba for the general population. They don't even know what inflation is, those numbers are the average increase in price of the "average products"(no idea what the term for this is in english, in portuguese its called IPCA).  
Here's the thing, there are 150B reais total, combined the banks hold ~29B of these 150, but the total amount of digital reais of all bank accounts is 2.17 trillion reais.  
They achieve this by making deals with the government, they make low interest loans to "boost the economy!!1" in exchange the government lets them loan wayy more than they actually have backing it.  
75x the actual amount of money was injected in the economy...this is going to be a disaster sooner or later.

Brazil. But hey, could be worse, Venezuela had 36% in October.  
I really wanna see someone trying to save enough money in this kind of fiat to buy anything decent.

In Venezuela you can buy food in the blackmarket using cryptocurrencies. Or just as a way to store value, since the bolívar inflation this year is currently at 760%(numbers from a totalitary government, so...yeah)

Where I live we suffer from having 10%+ inflation every year, can you even imagine simply not being able to save money?
In first world countries bitcoin is cool and hype, but in the third world its saving lives

He is as democratically elected as Kim Jong-un

I like to keep these things hidden among the texts of the books I have in my PC, it's practically impossible for someone to find them even if they knew where to search.

Its also an important test. If bitcoin can't prove its resilience against big corporations wanting to mess with it, it's worthless. If x2 wins, I'll sell it all and go to eth or what have you

You can't prove that they wouldn't exist in a free market, therefore it's wrong of YOU arguing that they absolutely wouldn't, that they are the government's blessing. How many possible inventors have wars killed? Or how much money was quite literally blown up buying bombs? Corruption? Bad administration? Debt interest? Inflation? It's impossible to know how things would have worked in this alternate reality, so you can't make a statement like that. But the fact that you are here means you don't trust the government that much and/or his capabilities when it's about your money.  
The last phrase I'd argue it's a plus, not a minus for the market.

Feel free to study a bit deeper about Mandela and how african countries ended up as they are now, through socialism; classical statist, the state shoves the country down the dirt and then its the free market's fault. Small private militaries for hire do exist, olicharchies do exist, cronies and wall streets do exist, but how they sustain themselves? Through. The. Fucking. Government.  
Get your statism out of bitcoin, please, go buy some petro from venezuela instead. And since you lost your mind in statism and ad hominems. MUUUH ROADSZZ MUUUH ROADS WHO GONNA BUILD MUUH ROADSZ. HURR DURR THERE ARE PRIVATE RAILROADS EVERYWHERE BUT WHO GONNA BUILD MAH ROADDSSSS. That's about it, peace out.

Any proof to back that up? That those resources, if allocated by the market wouldn't have achieve the same or even better results?

By african free markets you mean the countries that were/are being destroyed by socialism?  
Saying the government protects your propriety is a contradiction. You have to pay taxes and the government holds the monopoly of law and violence. No amount of thieves can steal/attack your private property so much in the long run. They are the ones who step on your rights the most by an enourmous margin.  
Wars only happen when you can shove the cost on someone else. Hitler didn't pay anyone out of his pockets. Trump is not paying the bombs from his and so on. There is no private war, only states use such barbaric means.  
You think the free market can't build fucking roads? I can't believe people still fall for that. Be a realist, compare that to, say, building a cellphone, it's nothing.

No you cannot. You simply can't possible be sure that without the government we wouldn't be teleporting around the galaxy by now, since that was not the "storyline" we went through, we have no info on the other ones. Also, tell that to Elon Musk.
