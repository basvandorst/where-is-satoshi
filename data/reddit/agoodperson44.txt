No, you , cant. Please explain exactly how? Don't just say these vague things. Futures derivatives are influenced by the spot price. How can the futures POSSIBLY affect the spot directly? It cant, please stop spreading misinformation
EDIT: Downvoted yet no one can explain why they think futures can manipulate the spot price hahahaha. What a joke this sub has become
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:37:26
We are talking about direct market manipulation. The other user claimed futures could directly drive spot price. 
I know exactly how futures arbitrage works, and thats not manipulation. It only causes the spot and futures price to converge faster as you move towards expiration, while pocketing a small profit. 
How is that manipulation? Arbitrage makes the market more efficient
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:57:39
lmao, looks like you don't. Spot/futures arb only pushes the spot and futures closer to convergence as you approach expiration. So again, how exactly can spot price be manipulated WITHOUT trading the actual spot?
looks like you know nothing
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:27:27
If they heavily short sell futures contracts, but the spot price doesnt follow, they are on the hook for a **MASSIVE** loss. Do you realise that futures are marked to market? I highly doubt they would do something like that. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:16:47
Yeah And I guarantee I know more about derivatives than you do. Futures price does not dictate spot price. Its the other way around. How can the futures price possibly affect the spot? There isnt any point talking to you if you truly believe that
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:17:54
hahaha another typical retard trying to sound like a smart big boy. Nice answer to the question. 
Exactly how does one use futures to manipulate the spot? Yeah, no answer. Looks like you have a genuinely low iq
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:06:44
Wtf? Lol what does wall street have to do wth anything? Dumb millennial lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:30:13
Please stop saying vague things and actually explain how. They cant manipulate it using futures, its not directly connected to the spot price. It just uses the spot price as an index. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:15:13
Okay how? Lol. At least explain how instead of just jumping on the “fuck u wallstreet” bandwagon
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:40:28
Sorry you still havent explained how they could manipulate the spot price with futures
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:17:50
Futures does not directly have any effect on the spot bitcoin price. That is just an indirect effect of noobs panicking 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:21:02
Nice response. Please explain exactly how the futures price could **possibly** directly change the spot price? 
You are probably just getting confused because the spot always converges with the futures price, so you think that the futures price actually directly infuences the spot lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:22:04
Sorry we are talking about futures, not spot
