Its always good when people oppose an idea, it means its disruptive.
Bitcoin is not a reserved word, its mostly the community around it, if enough people adopt a bitcoin 2.x, then it becomes bitcoin 2.x . One value does not fit all, one technology of value transfer maybe can. This will not devalue existing bitcoin, on the contrary it is the way to move bitcoin to the mass market, and therefore increase its value to a technological value. The current bitcoin can't scale above the price of $1000 per bitcoin without the need to either create bitcoin 2.x, or start a new chain which is not compatible with existing network which will completely destroy the current one.

"Stock is only worth something because of court-enforcible liquidation standing" 
That's exactly the same statement we hear constantly "currency is only worth something because its backed by government" 
If you believe that, I would be happy to buy all your btc for $1.
Government and legal/regulatory framework (i.e banks) acts mostly as a mediator of trust, it can easily be substituted with other forms, like technology (bitcoin), or social identities (Facebook ?)

"we can simply say that price 1 colored satoshi is price of 1 satoshi + price of security it represents." This actually works in most jurisdictions as each share must have declared par value in issuance "In some jurisdictions, each share of stock has a certain declared par value, which is a nominal accounting value used to represent the equity on the balance sheet of the corporation. In other jurisdictions, however, shares of stock may be issued without associated par value." ( So 1 santoshi is the min par value by design, anyone could also define higher par value and say one share is worth 1 btc, this creates a minimum book value for these shares so when people buy the shares they also hold min value of btc (in bitcoin, they can actually hold it), this acts as a trust builder for shareholders as they hold the min book value of the company.

I support every word, it is indeed the next step transforming the bitcoin from a single currency into an economy of multiple currencies !
To support coloured coins, check out bitcoinX.org the initial POC and help get more clients to support the bitcoinX protocol.

The legal framework for coloured coins should not be different of the legal framework of bitcoin, in fact issuing a currency is considered much harder than issuing security. If someone is willing to sell you Facebook stock, and you trust that entity to guarantee the price in bitcoins, than all you need is to trust that entity, just like the value of bitcoin is derived by the trust of the community.
