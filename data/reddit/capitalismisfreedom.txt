Meanwhile I'm far more likely to trust a respected journalist who has been doing this type of work for four decades over someone with political stake in the game.

That's not how deep background works. If Woodward had to reveal his sources, we'd have never had his and Bernstein's Watergate work.  You often can't get the real/complete story without concealing identities.

Have you not read any excepts from the book? Woodward sets scenes full of quotes. Some are presumably even by the people who originally said them, though only Woodward knows who those sources are. When one person attributes those words to another, it's hearsay. That doesn't mean that it's somehow invalid.
@_date: 2018-09-12 01:59:41
That, friend, is what quotes are. Hearsay. That doesn't make them somehow invalid.

That's not necessarily a great thing for a currency...

You missed the biggest draw- tax evasion.

Really?  It's hard to feel sorry for someone who hasn't diversified.  Bitcoin's awesome and all, sure, but come on.  Your net worth would be looking a lot better if you were holding investments or assets in USD, EUR, etc...

Thanks, I appreciate it!

That's a bit cynical of you...  Sure, I'm advertising, but it's also sharing news of an expanding Bitcoin economy with the people who actually care.  I don't expect to really make anything from Bitcoin purchases for the foreseeable future.  The market is still very small.  So, no, I'm not advertising with a bs story.  I'm advertising with a very real statement on doing what I can to help add to what people can buy with Bitcoin.

Oh, and since I'm a huge fan of everything you guys have done in teaching me about Bitcoin and keeping me up to date on all the news, I've created a coupon code especially for Bitcoin transactions.  Get 10% off with the code  BITCOINOPENER at checkout.

Thanks.  And you're right, which is why I accept other currencies, as well.  My thought process was more or less, "So I am a supporter of Bitcoin and I've opened an internet shop.  The internet is the easiest place to transact in Bitcoin and it's only a little more work for me to help expand the range of goods available for purchase, so why not?"  It would almost feel hypocritical for me if I didn't accept it.
@_date: 2014-05-29 17:48:15
Thanks, man!

I'm just jealous of your v9. My Model 3 is bathed in WiFi for 12 hours a day and still no dice.

That's not how ownership works... Possession is non synonymous with ownership.

People who place the dollar sign following the value deserve to have their private keys shared with the world.
@_date: 2018-07-07 13:24:41
Nope. In U.S. dollars. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 12:56:57
USD is American... And the dollar sign always comes first in America (and many, many other places).

You're right on the units of scientific account. But good luck finding a contract that ever lists 1$ in its terms.

No, no, no. You would account for them as payables on the Big Mac ledger, so you would totally need to have the capacity to present to the coinbearer on demand, which isn't a problem if McDonald's has sufficient assets and receivables. :)
@_date: 2018-07-07 12:54:31
Not the "rest of the world." £ comes first, ¥ comes first, € is mixed... Anyway, it's not particularly logical to place it afterward and certainly isn't scientific. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 12:55:16
The convention exists for standardization. $1.99 is read "one dollar and ninety-nine cents," and surely you wouldn't want to write it 1$99¢ to match word order.

I don't think the market for sand made from obliterated antiquities is particularly strong, but what do I know?
@_date: 2013-10-11 17:25:51
Oh, I certainly prefer it without an associated article, but I just wanted to point out that I can understand why it would be referred to that way and that it isn't wrong to do so.
@_date: 2013-10-07 12:30:27
It's understandable.  We have the dollar, the pound, the euro, etc.
