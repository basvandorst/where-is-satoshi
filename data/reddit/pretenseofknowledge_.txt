I see. Well that's good. I had been toying with the idea of selling my BTC just out of fear that once the TX fees reach the thousands of dollars per transaction, certain addresses would no longer be profitable to move. It sounds like you're not willing to let it go that far, so that's nice.

I don’t think I’m allowed to post it here. Just google some things or look at other bitcoin sub Reddits.

Fascinating.

BCH is hard forking to fix the EDA quite soon, actually.

Didn't know that kind of opinion was popular here. Well, that gives me hope for Bitcoin.

I’m aware of how a settlement layer works, but I appreciate the spirit of the write up regardless.

I wish everything you were saying here was true. It would be nice to be one community. Unfortunately the events of the last several years serve as evidence that what you are saying is not true.

For sure. Out of curiosity, there's someone else in this thread claiming people here do want bigger blocks, just in different circumstances. Is that your sense of the general opinion as well? I'm not trying to 'debate', just want to understand the consensus here.

Haha well, a few people have called me 'douchebags' in response to this post, so probably not all of us. But you can be my friend :D

Really? Well that's news to me. I haven't been reading this forum at all, so I'm not up on the latest debate within this community.

In the spirit of this thread, I really don't want to argue. But please read up on how the community, this community in particular, became so fractured.
