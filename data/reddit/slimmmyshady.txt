If they can create an account, send it to their key. Easiest way. They won't need to worry about limits to accept payments

Thank you!

YAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSS-basic white girl here who HODLs 
Edit: Guys, after seeing the comments, I'm terribly sorry... I'm a dude. I was merely "portraying" the basic white girl version of "yes" when one is pleased lol

Please delete this cancerous fucking post already.

I've yet to watch them all the way through, just rad bits here and there but I liked the majority of it.
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:16:05
Doing so would be just nonsensical. It was all speculation whether or not they said "absolutely" or "maybe". Don't be fucking petty

Khan has always been at the top of the information lesson world, teaching people the things that society and schools failed to do thoroughly. Glad to see this addition to their material.

Bless Texas. The real reason why you have the extra dough to invest.

So you find it to be a complete coincidence that the day China's politicians began announcing a ban of Bitcoin, the price plummets 33%?
Bitcoin does not care what politicians SAY, we all know this. It is the effect of what the politicians say, and what that effect has on people's beliefs and actions. There is a huge indirect affect from what politicians say and do.

Regardless, this will legitimize it to become more to be perceived as a stock, rather than a currency.
@_date: 2017-01-23 22:23:09
Can we include Waco, too? 
@_date: 2017-01-13 15:22:34
I couldn't agree with you more, on what truly drives BTC prices. But it would be total ignorance to conclude that those who are fear-driven, the panic-sellers, and those that act on political portrayals of investments, doesn't have an effect.

I love you.

Regards to your first answer, why?
@_date: 2017-09-20 15:59:47
You said it best. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 18:30:39
What are you talking about? Equifax was legitimately breached with proof of leaked information about thousands of their customers. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 15:46:42
Okay, let's talk about why. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 00:17:23
her, himself?
I’ll be damned. It is 2017, after all. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 16:06:15
Is sounds like your entire argument is based upon ICO's, a small part of Ethereum's functionality. Your automatic assumption is that Ethereum attempted to use decentralization as means to escape tyranny when this was never Ethereum's function of decentralization, it was used as that is the way in which the blockchain functions properly until another form can be implemented (i.e. PoS). 
@_date: 2017-09-09 18:35:53
So what you're saying is that the equifax hackers have yet to publicly reach out. I don't think so
@_date: 2017-10-03 01:47:59
Yes. 
Is there a problem with Coinbase legitimizing multiple coins? First and foremost, they are a business aimed precisely at making money. If the money is there, they will eventually move there. 
With that said, they understood that even the people who hold and trade BTC, also do the same with BCH. (This understanding is an entirely different argument I really don’t wish to engage in, but the evidence is substantial all over Reddit.) So, there is some demand in the crypto market for BCH, there is not an issue for Coinbase to want to provide it. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 00:21:03
They will release a legitimate statement, they did about the split to BTC/BCH, and they will about this too. When they find it appropriate. Lee shouldn’t be communicating this to us. Honestly I find it a huge conflict of interest

Must've been a rule respected by approx 1% of sellers, it has its reputation for a reason. 
Even if he had the intent to keep it purely ethical at the beginning, he was void of regulating it, while still being the Founder/Owner/Creator, which makes him liable
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:40:35
ETH price surge? What does that have to do with BTC? ICO’s? Very few actually collected from BTC. 
ETH bulls behind BTC’s bulls. Don’t try to make ETH a BTC problem, stick to LTC. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 04:27:32
You got a few things wrong... first, I'm not rich (I suppose, at my age, this depends on your perspective). Second, I don't trade BTC, I traded ether... (so I hold 0 bitcoins) THIRD, I still think you're lying. 
I understand, my friend, that you created this entire thread, with the sole desire of hoping someone will test you, so that you can try to get them to bet against you. I mean, for fucks sake, you even commented on doing that... 
How about this, miner: since you make .007 btc (or $18) per miner per day, how about you either a) post a picture with proof of your farm or b) send me your mining profits for the next 5 years? :) so.... roughly $821,250. 
I'll take a check, please.

I'm not sure what constitutes "goods and services" but "goods" i.e. drugs, and "services" i.e. hitmen (&amp; much more), completely justifies a hefty prison sentence, but perhaps not for life. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:30:26
And drugs?
Whatever the intent was by admin, or mods, it's purely nonsense to say that it was regulated and hitmen did not exist. 
Let's say they even didn't, the site was still composed of 99% illegal components. It doesn't justify it. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 04:00:59
I'm going to do absolutely nothing. 
You're just a funny little troll who gets upset when people call you out on the internet for pretending to have giant farms. I think it's cute, really. Not mad at all. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 04:47:08
That would only serve right coming from my Italian background! I'd love to. The owner is a good family-friend of mine, I'll grab us some reservations in private seating. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 05:35:46
I'm sorry?
@_date: 2017-07-01 05:08:27
None taken. Let me think about it. I'm usually opposed to meeting people online but you seem like a cool guy. 
I do have an interest in what you're doing, I love crypto. But I don't think I would apologize to you. My only reasoning is that proof is vital in this business and you have us none. Yes, there were those photos you showed us a while back, but not to be rude, they didn't show much of anything really. 
Feel free to shoot me a PM and we can talk about meeting if you want. Just a quick beer and a short chat. Like I said, I really think you could be a cool guy. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 04:05:34
I think it will still be cute... 
The other "thing": if you are not telling the truth, you're entire premise falls apart. Well I suppose, whatever is left of your original premise, really. There isn't much of it left, because, well, this is all a joke. But I appreciate you making my evening rather interesting. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:48:08
Can you come down to Tutto Fresco in the OC? I'm here until the evening for "family".
@_date: 2017-07-01 04:56:57
If you're serious about this, I'm going to have to perform some security measures. I realize that sounds strange, but please understand I mean it in no offense to you. It's just for my personal keepsake. 
Also, may I ask, why are you in SD right now &amp; not in your farm? I'd imagine the weather is wretched compared to what we have here.
@_date: 2017-07-01 03:38:47
We mean, like, real god damn pictures of you with your S9s in the damn desert with all your solar ish. The full operations. You have trolled this thing forever so finally clear your name for gods sake and post something that's real. 
Or just stfu and leave this subreddit. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 04:53:10
Absolutely not, on the internet, it's one thing. You defend yourself. In person, I would have no guards against you. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 04:32:40
I suppose you can send it to me, but with how slow bitcoin's blockchain processes transactions, the $20 you have in your bank account would probably grow quicker. 
Anyhow, dan_from_san_diego, let me know when you're back in San Diego. I own that modern house with white frosted glass in front of La Jolla Cove. Beautiful view, really.

He still hasn't met me at Piatti in La Jolla like he said he would.
