First of all the term you're looking for is "inelastic" and second of all no. No it's not.

Don't need to be an econ prof to know that bitcoin is coming up to some hard times soon, any macroecon 101 course will tell you that you cant have growth like this forever
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:34:25
No, you can. People aren't trying to apply stock rules to bitcoin, they're applying *economic* rules. Rules that are based on humans, not stocks. No ones trying to figure out the PE ratio of bitcoin, they're trying to figure out when profit takers are going to reach a critical point.

if you want to practice you can just pretend you bought in with fake money.
Pretend you bought in with 5k now and see how many BTC that would get you, record it and go from there

Anyone who's done a basic macroeconomics course in high school knows that bitcoin will never replace fiat, not because people don't want it to, but because it cant.

oh i plan to buy the dip, with GDAX crossing 10.5k at the time of this post though, the dip doesnt look as likely
@_date: 2017-11-18 10:53:26
How would this even work? You say "i want this", they say "ok that'll be X amount in BTC", you show them that you're sending it to them on your phone or something and hang around until its confirmed? Not to mention the fees that could double the price of what you're buying.
Ironically enough, bitcoin doesn't seem like a good currency

it **is** too good to be true and this sub is blind to not realise it. One day bitcoin will probably reach these figures (well I'm not confident on a million but maybe) but at a continuous compounding rate? come off it. We're in a boom right now and booms do not last forever. 
As much as I wish this table was true, it's batshit crazy to think we can reach a million dollars by any of those dates. Even 2027 is WAY too early. This is on the same level of as "bitcoin will replace fiat".
 wait for the bust and buy more BTC, that's my plan.

This is why i just cashed out. I'm predicting a big dip at $10k from all the long term hodlers cashing out after reaching the big milestone
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:26:34
Me too, I'm definitely planning to buy the dip and I'm sure others are as well
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:30:41


I wish they wouldn't charge me 4% just to buy and another 4% to transfer
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:46:31
No, because of basic economic concepts

One of the first things you learn in statistics is you cant extrapolate beyond the data you have. This chart is bogus

A global crisis would make the price of bitcoin go up, not down
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:45:00
  
  
  
  
  
  
3 to start with. This isn't even going into problems on bitcoins end like the fact that interest could never work with bitcoins current system and interest literally drives the economy

This sub has been criticised for being way too optimistic about bitcoin and damn does it show here.  
Thinking about investment at your age is great but bitcoin is not the way to go. Save your money and buy into some safer shares when you're 18 to reap the benefits of compound interest (which bitcoin does not have). If you want to put a bit into bitcoin, go for it but it should not be the majority of your portfolio

Unless you're a multi multi millionaire, this is retarded

So what's the point of buying through coinbase? Convienience? 
Edit: after logging into gdax I also realised that I can't buy through there because of my region so coinbase is the only alternative

wuh duh thats like answering the "what causes the wind to blow" question with "the air"  
  
@_date: 2017-10-16 13:49:09
No it's retarded, don't fall for the hype of this sub. 
Bitcoin fluctuates so much that it's just not worth it.
