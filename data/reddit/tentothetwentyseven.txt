Hello I totally get your point. And it quite a smart insight. However you are forgetting about the facts. 
Your mistake is that you are assuming that the trend is going to repeat over and over. You would be right if the causes of the historical crashes of bitcoin would be all the same. But the causes why BTC crashed in most of the graphs you showed Are all different. 
Remember the exchanges that got hacked. It crashed.
Remember when China banned the icos. It crashed.
Remember when CEO of JP Morgan spoke about it. It crashed.
All different causes. If one of these happens again it will definetly crash but you can’t assume that those causes will always repeat due to the graphs that you see. These are not stocks my friend we are talking about a whole new industry. 
I am not saying that it will not crash again, but what I am saying is that if you will speculate at least use some facts because what you are saying is not true.

Hello and great day fellow friend!
Whether if you are in college or high school hopefully you should understand that inflation does not happen because currency is distributed. Inflation mainly happens when The government prints excess of bills with nothing that backs it up (either gold resources etc) 
The price of BTC is purely defined by supply and demand given its utility and is not backed up by any type of resource (decentralized technology)
There is something that you don’t understand. There is a specific amount of bitcoin that will ever be distributed. 
The way it works, keeping it short and simple, is that as the difficulty increases it becomes harder to mine and less bitcoins will be distributed through time. (When bitcoin started there were given 50 btc per block completion, now it is only 12.5 btc per block completion)
The number of bitcoins that will be distributed in total remains the same the only thing that changes is that the supply decreases through time which actually helps the coin gain value by nature.

Do your research. Hop into the omisego website and go from there. Better if you do it on your own.
