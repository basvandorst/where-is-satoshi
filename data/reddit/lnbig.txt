It will not help to refund your funds. You should have channel data for refund. Please read this:

I am planning to launch a realtime event viewer (channel opening / closing, new node / update node) on the lightning network with history data. If private channels will be shown in the data you can do not worry: they will be anonymized (HMAC with secret key). My goal is for people to feel the heartbeat of the lightning network, so to speak ;-)

ChannelID and ChannelPoint are only transaction ID in blockchain of opening channel. To restore funds from channel after force-closing from my side you need to have private keys from channel database of your side. These private keys are not covered by seed (will be in LN protocol 1.1 but not now). If you have LND with static channel backups (SCB term) - you can restore but you don't need a help from me in this case (a backup restore procedure will restore channel keys from static channel backups).

By default base 1000 msat + 100/1000000 rate. But sometime i do now update for all channels to zero fees (base 0 + 1/1000000 rate) - for organic rebalancing

Hello! You can see my stats (mannualy posted). I get theirs by my own scripts through gRPC API of LND
For example **last 24 hours**:The last 24 hours of LNBIG: **Amount transactions: 507** The sum of **transfered BTC: 0.54957887**
And for **last 30 days:** All forwarded transaction for last 30 days: **20274**
So average i have about 500-600 forwarded payments through 25 nodes. How already wrote here [ user "It is actually impossible to tell the total number of transactions that  occurred on the network as a whole, this is by design, for privacy"
**But I can roughly assume that the number of transactions most likely does not exceed 2000 per day.**
My nodes have very attractive commissions for wallets and large capacities, which is by and large a preference for many wallets when they calculate the route. But it must also be borne in mind that many users may have direct channels with merchant nodes. Such payments do not use routing at all and do not pass through the network of LNBIG.

Hi, All!
I decided to write this post mainly because of the appearance of this message.
In fact, this Reddit message has stamped "ch\*ld p\*rn" on the project. I will use the term below "CP" because i hate this and don't want to advertise this term through Redit. Other users read this message and start sharing this label in other forums without understanding. I want to explain my duty, and if the author of this message is satisfied, I ask you to correct your message and and do not blame the distribution of CP.
I am a system administrator, programmer and accompany the work of servers and sites on these IPs. I will say right away - yes, you are right, at these IPs to be run sites with porno. I know this because it is my responsibility to respond and respond to the abuses. And these sites to be run at my developed software. I know this questioin from tech side. Let me explain how this works.
All these sites - search engines by porn tubes. They use "feeds" with videos links from third-party tubes. These tubes allow to get feeds of videos and feed of deleted videos. Our sites don't have content - only preview thumbnails and links to third-party tubes. When we got abuse - i will delete a link of video gallery from our database and thumbnails too. Sometimes anybody can load illegal video to some tube and tube can publish it and put link to "feed". As rules same videos quickly to be abused, original tube to be deleted and they put link to "feed" of deleted videos. Our systems uses "deleted videos feeds" from our side to delete abused videos. Although this is very rare, I personally did not see any childrens at our sites at preview thumbnails of size 240x180 pixels. But even in such cases, we immediately remove as soon as we see this. Sometimes even the camera angle makes you think about it. But if you click and watch the original video, in 99% of cases everything is legal there. Sometimes they (users) publish videos with celebrities from films where a child passes in some frame, and the system of screenshots accidentally captures this frame. We also immediately remove such videos! Basically all abuses come to the hoster. Hoster redirects to us and i should react during 24 hours. There are many DMCA abuses. May be 95% of DMCA ones and 5% of other type. We had abuse email link in our sites but now we decided to remove it - this emails are used by spammers and 90% of email goes to our provider anyway to their emails.
Dear viajero\_loco, personally i think you could not see the video with a 12-year-old girl and 40+ men, who also raped her. This video instantly causes panic fear in us and our partners (tubes). Personally, i think you said it specifically to draw attention to it. Therefore, i ask you, if you have seen - you can send a link, for example, to this address: [lnbig.com or to any abuse address in whois of domain. It's temporary email for LNBIG project. If you have not seen this - please correct your message!
Now about LNBIG project. It's my private project. I am interested by bitcoin from 2014-2015 years. From this time i converted all my earns to bitcoins and i love this technologie. Now i get earning in bitcoins. I hate banks. I know how bitcoin works in details. I am not HODLer. I think for ecosystem will be better if i will earn bitcoins and pay by bitcoins. I know many merchants who accept bitcoins. I support theirs by my purchases through bitcoin payments. Now i know in details for LN works and decides to support this network. I had run LN nodes in our servers. And i want to support LN ecosystems. Because i had small time i decide first to run nodes and later to run the [LNBIG.com]( site and email box. Temporary email of project is [lnbig.com Today i will add TXT DNS record in [LNBIG.com]( as proof that this email is of project. Later i will run site. But this label badly spoils the future of the project in the way. And it was hanged in this forum, while other people refer to this forum and spread unverified information.
Best regards, LNBIG owner.

It's hard for me to say, because there is no data about this video. If you see the next time, it is enough for me to send the link to the preview thumbnail or even the coded link to the redirect from out site. We use encoded redirect links because there are many spammers where they use third-party sites with redirects scripts for their spam.
About the Japanese girl. A lot of Japanese models look like young, but in fact they are far beyond the 18+. It is often difficult for Europeans and Americans to determine the age of Japanese women, they often seem very young to them. Unfortunately, this is a feature of this niche, but we do not want to delete it either.

And i use `clusterssh` tools under Linux for working with LND servers
@_date: 2018-11-26 19:23:02
I did there updates last. Now these servers work successfully. May be channels were restored. Please check up ;-)
@_date: 2019-01-31 00:36:20
I develop now a free service like Thor of Bitrefill. I hope it will be ready through one week. I wrote already core code. You will be able to open channel yourself. The main goal will be to suggest the free service of openning a channel to Bitcoin Lightning Wallet users of Android - they will be able to accept incoming payments without any funds from their side by only QR code scanning. But i will bring to facility to open a incoming channel to LN nodes.
Today i changed the logo of LNBIG (it's on the site) ;-)

"how many transactions went through your nodes in that 1 month?"
I did now: `lncli fwdinghistory --start_time 1546038000 --end_time 1548716400 --max_events 1000000`
It's interval from 2018-12-29 to 2019-01-29
Here is the sum of all `last_offset_index` fields from 20 nodes:
81 + 26 + 45 + 10 + 35 + 52 + 39 + 33 + 159 + 22 + 73 + 1066 + 191 + 209 = **2775**
The leader is LND-01 (1066 transactions)
So there was 2755 transactions for 30 days... ;-)
@_date: 2019-01-30 18:48:29
It's my own hobby project. I don't plan to finish it. And I don't plan to significantly increase the fees. In addition, large fees will reduce my chances of forwarding of payments in my network.
@_date: 2019-01-30 18:56:58


Each node has own bitcoind daemon ([0.17.0.1](


Bitcoind [0.17.0.1]( compiled from sources :)
I used the tools: [


CentOS 6.\*


[Advanced Hosters]( They accept bitcoins ;-) And they are domain provider too - [ahnames.com]( and accept bitcoins too! And i recommend it. They have the best admin area for domain managment


`telnet` [`lnd-01.lnbig.com`]( `22`

I have 20 nodes in defferent servers. An each server has bitcoind &amp; lnd daemons.
"Does having a larger BTC balance in a node increase fees taken?"
Sorry, i don't know now...
@_date: 2019-01-30 18:49:27
No, only 2755 :) I wrote above :)
@_date: 2019-01-30 18:51:13
They (nodes) to be connected by 0.16 BTC channels. I did it at first time after starting. And i connected by manually to nodes from [ list - i checked my lovely shops there and did channels. :)
