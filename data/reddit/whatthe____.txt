It's tough being in the consumer Bitcoin hardware game, while completely missing the enterprise blockchain world.

OK, we get it, you did yet another BTC debit card. (YAWN)
 
This reminds me of 21, periodically posting here to keep their announcement in the news, ignoring the message that NOBODY CARES.

Forgive sanswork, paleh0rse. After all, his id is sanswork, not sanework. Like most, he doesn't understand why Bitcoin's blockchain is (practically) immutable. He doesn't understand that the result of proof-of-work is the key to a block, and you can't just replace that key with any key and get the same kind of immutability.

Why? A trademark is not a patent. And, merely discovering an early occurrence is not likely to solve AA's problem.

nice insight, oak pac. it makes filtering through the 99% drivel worth it.

Nice, but not even close to VISA.

China's smart. Better the PRC had access to a possible way to control Bitcoin than the USG or Wall St. or any other entity with the $.
The USG could subsidize electricity for mining operations in Alaska or my running a 21 chip in my lightbulb.
@_date: 2015-08-10 00:45:07
Agreed. Just like Wall St.

It's not the "what," as if Bitcoin is a system. At this point, it's the "who." Who actually determines the Bitcoin price? Speculators and i(llicit)-commerce buyers/sellers.

It's just a Marxism growth spurt, that's all.

If "against Bitcoin" means pointing out well-grounded issues with Bitcoin from a technical and economic point of view, like  then yes, they're dead against it, and r/bitcoin continues to be the 3 wise monkeys,

Bitcoin mining is now controlled by adults. Bitcoin software is controlled by children. And that's Bitcoin's biggest problem. On the plus side, this volatility is ideal for speculators/traders, not investors.

About as smart as you for even pointing that out...as if it matters. If they were THAT smart, there wouldn't be "a lot of cynics and pessimists here." We crowd-source smartness.

Gee, with all the absolute &amp; convincing arguments as to why "You can't have a blockchain without bitcoin" by such knowledgeable gentlemen as yourselves, you'd think you all would stop wasting your own time and just let those who attempt it go ahead and make fools out of themselves. I guess you're just too selfless, compassionate, and kind to let it go. (.~)

And your company wants to charge me $400 to "remove the friction?" Dude, I'll wait for the open source "21 without 21" project that will replicate all of your commodity software. Now what?

Human nature: Sour grapes + Marc trying desperately to save his wrong bet on Bitcoin (e.g., in 21...20...19...) and not enterprise use of the technology. If Marc was sure he was on the winning side, he wouldn't need to tweet against the competition.
@_date: 2015-09-18 16:29:01
One of the best level-headed answers I've seen to this. Let's save this answer in Bitcoin's blockchain and refer to it for infinity when this question comes up again. And then, the Bitcoin proponents can get back to trying to make their system work, and the enterprise blockchain proponents can continue to try to turn "private blockchains" into another platform for businesses to build new applications.

I think you'd want to try to start to find the dimensions &amp; ranges of conditions/values under which it does work. Perhaps write a simulator, ideally using the same code that's in production, and a generator for simulations.

I'm not sure what the SP stands for, but the V must be for Vitriol. The entire Bitcoin community is filled with it. Do you all think consumers or businesses want any part of that? Anyway, thanks for the blockchain! We'll take that, while you all continue the Bitcoin circle jerk that nobody really cares about any longer (except the fools left holding their BTC).
