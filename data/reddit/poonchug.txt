Coinbase is fine/legit but its expensive. Buy on coinbase and transfer to binance so you can trade coins. Etherium has the lowest transaction fees. Look at IOTA.

If you have a lot of crypto the ONLY safe way to keep it is cold storage. Would you keep your passwords in a password keeping app? No, because that's stupid.

Haha ok. My argument is that it is not money it is a product that is sold a lot of places that don't require me to prove who I am. I'll buy my coin somewhere else is all. Oh and it's not a financial service no matter how hard it tries, it's coin ebay + pops price guide.

It's not a financial services company. You buy a thing and you sell a thing. If you bought poptarts at Walmart and then sold them to your friend no one asks you for an ID and is solely your responsibility to pay the taxes on your poptart profits. Don't confuse cryptocurrency with legitimate currency, no one will bail out bitcoin when/if it becomes valueless.

You can also buy bit with a credit card. Amazon links to your account. I don't use financial services that aren't insured bitcoin isn't backed by anything but good thoughts. There's no army, no country, no gdp supporting cryptocurrencys. They can try to be a financial institution but they don't have a currency just a product and I don't give up my license to buy products.

I don't think that's right. Winning the lotto is not inevitable for any one person but the sun flipping it's magnetic poles appears to be inevitable and imminent. I'm not say that will do anything to btc but I don't think your odds are evaluated correctly. Plus one person (or a few) win the lotto every so often where as the magnetic pole shift is a global event. Say it were to cause some global emp (not that it would be strong enough to do anything) and wiped all computer memory. Would that not ruin or eliminate the block chain? Again I am not say that will happen or should be any sort of concern just curious.

That's doesn't change the problem that they want my ID to buy and sell. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 20:09:58
Poppycock! Then why now instead of the whole time and why don't any of the other services take you license number. They need to report what they sell not who's buying it.

It's my responsibility to pay my taxes. Craigslist doesn't report to the Ira every time I sell some bullshit, that's my business.

State ID? Level 3? Mmm no, how about that? Why would my funds be unsafe all of a sudden? Guess I'll buy my coins elsewhere. Suck it coinbase.

Sure but until then leave my identity out of it

Hyperinflation happens all the time. I'd say the conception of digital currency would mark the beginning of a monetary revolution. However, only if it kills solid forms of money.

Hold on to your seats, money is worthless.

That doge though. I have doubled twice with the way that shit moves around. Wish I had more than $10 in.

It's just a term to describe the shape or the graph value over time. I'd say you could use it to describe the positive growth of anything that has value that changes over a period of time
