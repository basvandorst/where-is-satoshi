Oh, you mean like an apocalyptic scenario, and not just a transfer of money from dollar to bitcoin.
Well, yeah. If an asteroid kills us all, then yeah. Fuck the peseta.

Fuck it. I' want a Jay-z-coin.

Bitcoin Cash is like when the Drifters appear in Universal Paperclips.

It'll become the most expensive Lambo in history.

It’s alright. Merry Christmas, brother.

The product will go where the capital is. You used to sell potatoes for dollars? Well, sell them for satoshis. Or don't. What do you think is going to happen?

It's awesome. Might be the end of crypto as we know it. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:09:16
I bought it with a crazy new thing called euro.
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:25:24
The way I see it, we are creating a new kind of economy, where every unit of currency will be backed by cryptocurrency. And not only trying to do so, but that eventually it *will happen*.
The questions in my mind are:
- will it involve a collapse or ”war”?
- will Bitcoin be the chosen one?
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:27:02
One would need a decoy Blockfolio too.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:32:15
- Buy low, sell high.
- Buy at ATH and panic sell.
One of these is the better strategy.

It’s an [investor thing](
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:52:26
Cameron is the good twin and Tyler is the bad twin. The other one pushes an agenda like: ”all muslims are terrorists”, and the other one is like ”I’d let a gay muslim terrorist adopt me.”
Thesis, antithesis. Their true agenda lies in the middle, *synthesis*, and what it says is that we should push the price of bitcoin further up because Mark Zuckerberg is a thieving bastard.

This trend will not revert itself until updog.

The utility here and now is super relevant. I needed a cup of coffee really badly this morning, and the other cryptocurrencies came in super handy.

Perfect memeing. I'd tip you, but I'm a hodler.

What it means is that if traditional banksters and corrupt money-printing governments fuck up their part of the deal (as they are known to, now and again), then there is a backup. There will still be a means of trade that is beyond the manipulations of the traditional entities. 
The most logical thing is that S&amp;P 500 will have moved to Bitcoin by the time that happens. It just might not look very familiar.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:07:28
Lack of access for whom exactly? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:40:59
Peer to peer software piracy? Still pretty awesome.
Social networking websites? Meh, but still around.
Net browsers? Literally using one right now.
Mobile phones? Changed the world completely.
Walkman -&gt; portable music
Minidisc -&gt; compressed digital files as a portable music format
compressed digital files a as a portable music format -&gt; mp3 -&gt; iPod 
iPod + Nokia -&gt; smartphones
Point being, the technologies survived and evolved. So we kind of agree that the crypto revolution is the S-curve, and that it is here to stay. Bitcoin might prevail because of its first mover advantage, or it might be replaced by a Monero of sorts. Anyway, the ball is rolling. Trad. banking is on its way out. And that is fucking huge.
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:20:29
TCP/IP is still being used. e-mail is still being used. 
Bitcoin could be replaced by a better crypto, but crypto is here to stay. 
And because a deposit of value needs a lot of consensuated trust, Bitcoin, with its first-mover advantage is far beyond the reach of the current altcoins. An altcoin needs a truly revolutionary benefit to surpass Bitcoin at this point. But sure, it could happen. (Buy Monero.)
Google did it to Altavista, who did it to Yahoo. But once Google was there, it was there to stay.
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:34:18


Sure: don’t.

Also, being called the "Nintendo" of anything is pretty fantastic.

Yeah man. In hindsight I can’t believe I rooted for the tiny jew kid in The Social Network.

It goes up 600% (~80k) and then it comes down to just 300% (~50k). And then it goes up again.

Buy the all-time-high and panic sell for 50% a few days later. You were not listening in class, man.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:54:45
Earlier today I asked my gf, "was it this morning that I told you Bitcoin is 10.000 euros? Because now it's 11.000."
And right now it's 11.890 euros.
The correction will be dizzying. And if not, it'll be more dizzying still. Brace yourselves. Curves ahead.

”Plan B.”
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:08:32
Because Bitcoin has a 300 billion USD market cap as of today. That is a lot of people placing their confidence in Bitcoin. 
Money is a confidence game. The value of money is based on trust. Bitcoin has accumulated a lot of trust.
And then there is the [first-mover advantage](
And, as tranceology3 says, it is software and can evolve to stay with the times.
It's like trying to dethrone TCP/IP.
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:56:08
[the e-mail protocol]( not clients, silly.
And [Lightning Network](

What about those who pour their hard earned euros and yens, etc, in BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:38:56
I think there is a real possibility that fiat will go *down* at some point in the future. Like, all of it.
The way of snailmail and vapor engines and rotary dial telephones. 
At which point some cryptocurrency (most likely Bitcoin), will replace the entirety of money.
