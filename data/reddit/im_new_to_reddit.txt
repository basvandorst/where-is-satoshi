It's against Paypal TOS to buy digital currency I believe.

So just effectively changing it straight back to USD upon receiving payment? Then what is the point? Why not just exclusively accept USD in the first place?
It would just be a hassle to set up the whole process of accepting bitcoins when it's just going to get changed straight to USD as soon as it reaches them.

Im in university student accommodation and electricity is a flat bill. No kwh/hour charge. I mine at 300~ Mhash/s with my gaming computer, so I just leave it on in the background while I go about my day.

Until this currency system becomes bullet proof, I dont really think it's that safe to invest a significant amount of money in. As you said, DDOSing happens weekly, also bitcoin pools and wallet sites get hacked on a weekly basis.

It's just so early in it's execution that anything right now is possible. If there is 200,000 orders for BTC between $200-$current price, and 100,000 orders for BTC between $100-$199, and someone decides to cash out their 400,000 BTC, then the price crashes. Im not saying anyone in their right mind is going to do that, but it's extremely possible.
I believe that the reason why people aren't thinking the same way you are is just because it's such a new system... People are afraid of change. The USD and GBP have always been there, it's what people know.
When the media grabs onto this currency, then people who are not technologically-minded will start investing, driving prices higher.

Man... that Jury is going to fall in love with you.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:44:55
I've tried but surprisingly, no one else is interested. I know a couple of rich kids that just bought some BTC outright, but no one seems interested in mining.
Im alright for cash anyway, worked full time over the summer to help myself during term time. This is just a sort of fun endeavour for me. Not really looking to put huge amounts of time into it.
But I agree... my GPU fans are loud as shit. Keeps my room warm though.

Calm your passions, son. Just letting you know that what you're doing could end up going awry.

Also aiming for 1BTC. Currently sitting at about 0.029BTC. 
Just remember for gambling... house always wins.

Actually 24h ago it was between $225-$230/BTC
It's now $200/BTC and falling.
Not saying it's a bubble bursting, but it's a definite impact...

Unfortunately for a large majority of people, hindsight is 20/20.
Im planning on investing in BTC in the future. Maybe then I will get one of these shirts!

Just an example. I dont live in the US so I can't say I know the price of coffee over there.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:52:41
It seems like it's working... standing at $222/BTC
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:50:25
My first tip, thank you sir!
@_date: 2013-04-28 12:09:40
Pretty much pointless. 
At the end of a shift, people like to have their tip cash in hand. No one wants to have to go home, get on the computer, go to some random website they haven't heard of before, convert a currency that they never knew of into USD, then provide bank details to the previously unknown website. It's just too much work. 
Just tip normally.

What website is this?
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:35:11
Well played!
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:01:23
Could be accidental. Lots of users watching the current crash.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:16:04
1. Get a summer job
2. Save up, don't spend frivolously
3. ????
4. Dont eat ramen every night (profit)
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:05:34
You... You'd do that?
Why? Karma isn't worth anything, while BTC is?
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:13:56
You only really need one website.
It allows you to spend bitcoins anywhere.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:16:37
Better to clear the debt early instead of letting the interest pile up.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:20:17
I think we are a long way off people being paid in bitcoins.
The price of bitcoins right now is fluctuating to such a massive degree that no one will pay anyone for services with them. Imagine having a window cleaner come to your house, you give him 0.5 BTC (its a large house) and then the next day, BOOM, 1 BTC = 800 USD. Great for him, not so great for you.
Same thing with big corporations and thousands of employees. BTC isn't taken seriously enough right now. If a global, blue-chip company paid their employees in BTC, and suddenely there was a huge crash, there would be chaos for that company.

You aren't obligated to do anything.
If I were to invest large sums of money in bitcoin, I'd wait for my initial investment to double, take out my initial investment and then periodically cash out with a set amount.
I.e. $1000 invested, doubles to $2000, take out initial $1000 and take out $200 every time it hits $1200.

It's the same problem with buying gold and silver. There is always a chance that the price is going to rise, or crash.
Currently we are sitting at $228/1BTC, which, 4 hours ago, was closer to $260/1BTC. It can go down.
It's a gamble. Be too careful, and you might not make as much as you thought you would. If you're not careful enough, you could end up losing a lot more money than you thought you could.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:21:27
It went from &lt;$50 to &gt;$250 in less than 30 days.
This is going to happen.
