As far as I am aware, you cannot import paper wallets to coinbase (or any other exchanges) anymore. You need to import them with blockchain.info, and then transfer them to Coinbase.
Then again, I am not entirely sure what would happen with your BCH if you import your wallet to something not supporting BCH.
EDIT: Apparently moving the BTC to an exchange or other wallet, doesn't affect the BCH. So you can safely redeem your BTC first and them play around with the remaining BCH (make sure you don't throw away the private key from your paper wallet as it still contains your BCH)

This chart is spot on pretty much:

There is not a single guide explaining the whole process sadly.
I did the following:
1) Install Coinomi (android app)
2) 'Create' BitcoinCash wallet.
Make sure you only have a BCH wallet, delete the BTC wallet that's pre-configurated. (Don't know if it matters a lot)
3) Import private key from paper wallet to BCH wallet on coinomi
4) Now you have your BTH in Coinomi and your BTC is still in the paper wallet
5) Send your BCH from coinomi to an exchange that supports BCH
6) Sell BCH
7) Profit
Some people suggest transferring the remaining BTC (in the paper wallet) to a new (paper) wallet for safety reasons, but this is not necessary if you use a 'safe' mobile wallet like coinomi (contrary to the new and unofficial electron cash).

Pretty much, buy if it gets above 4200, and wait if it's beneath
