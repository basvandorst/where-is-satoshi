Get your alt-right memes off bitcoin.

I mean with the entire internet down in the country I don’t think it’d be much better to keep your money in a bank.
Besides to me this is one of those issues where the technology just isn’t there. 
In ten years we’re going to have direct-to-satellite internet from anywhere in the world. It will be unstoppable. We’ll also have ubiquitous solar and wind energy. People will be able to charge their phones and share bitcoin independently of weather or governments.

The point is that if bitcoin went up 10x, Robin Hood could restrict your access to those bitcoins – this has happened dozens of times, most famously with [mt.GOX]( People had bitcoin in accounts with the service, and then when the service went down they no longer had access.   
Bitcoin isn't internet points that you hold in a bank account somewhere, it's cash stored under your bed. You want to make sure you have the keys to your apartment.

These kinds of speculative videos and articles are mostly bullshit. But often you see them pop up more and more towards the beginning of a bull run. 
It’s not that they’re necessarily correct, it’s just a correlation. As confidence returns to BTC, more people make videos and articles saying it’s going up again. 
That’s all I’d take from a post like this.

When you water a house plant you are *investing* in that plant.   
When you talk to your children and ask them how they felt about their day you are *invested* in their well-being.  
I agree that the word has an implication of a return, but that doesn't have to be from "cashing out". Buying bitcoin is investing in your future, it's investing in a new money paradigm, it's investing in new technology. You could never sell a single satoshi and you'd still be getting a return-on-investment in the form of having a store of value in a burgeoning experiment.   
I see where you're coming from, *for sure*, but to me it's a good word to use, whether you ever cash out or not.

Ding ding ding! 
I’m not saying bitcoin users are inherently selfless. What I’m saying is the term investing doesn’t have to be as strictly defined as the OP (or yourself) choose to see it. 
 In the first definition, you could buy bitcoin and never sell it or use it, and the return would be that you feel good having stored your wealth outside the banking system. Or that you feel secure knowing your children will have something to inherit. Or that you were part of history. 
The return doesn’t have to be the same currency. It can be an increase in happiness, a feeling of commonality with other bitcoin users, a sense of fiscal liberation. 
And so what I’m suggesting is that folks are using this word, because it allows for a whole range of definitions from the 100% literal to the completely metaphorical.

Hodlers have seen this kind of crash before.
