Maybe not 1TB, but 100MB to 1GB blocks are required to handle tens of millions of Bitcoin users. That can happen in faster than you think, the number of bitcoin users is doubling every 2 years.
Also bandwidth, CPU, and memory are primary hardware constraints. Storage is trivial by comparison since you can prune all the spent transactions and only keep the UXTO, which is like 2% of the total blockchain size.

Good questions. I don't have the answers. How decentralize is "decentralized enough" before we say it's OK to increase block sizes? It's all very subjective.
It's also hard to find answers to all these questions. Everyone is obsessed with infighting and the real issues don't seem to be getting debated.

Correct. After bitcoin absorbs all of the global M3 fiat money supply (about $75 trillion) the price will stabilize at about $3 million per bitcoin (pre-hyperinflation dollars). See [Hyperbitcoinization](
Long term, ignore alt coins. [The universe wants one money](

But you don't need to store the whole blockchain unless you want to be able to review the history of all bitcoin transactions. Storing only the unspent transaction outputs (UXTO) is sufficient to validate transactions, blocks, and balances.
I hope we see 100MB+ blocks in the next 20 years if not sooner. I envision the entire world using bitcoin. Even with 2nd layer solutions like LN, blocks need to be larger much larger to support 7 billion people.

IDK, it's really tricky. Every size increase makes it harder to run full nodes and mining pools. Increase the size too much and Bitcoin becomes centralized and easy for bad actors (governments) to manipulate. It's also nearly impossible to undo a size increase after it's been implemented and centralization starts to occur.
Personally I see 2MB as reasonable from a technical standpoint at this time. It would also send a message to the market that Bitcoin is capable of a HF, and more HFs are going to be required in the future (see my above reasoning on 7 billion users).
I think fees up to maybe $10 are okay since they really put the pressure on to build 2nd layer solutions. If we rely on just increasing the blocksize every time blocks fill up (Bitcoin Cash), there really isn't any incentive to implement the needed 2nd layer solutions.

It will happen sooner than you think. One currency crisis in a decent sized country, and you'll have millions of people flocking to bitcoin.

They also lock in the price before the ACH transfer clears. I bought LTC last week at $41, but Coinbase won't get their USD until today or tomorrow (LTC is $60+ by that time).

Bitcoin is "trustless" only in that the 3rd party payment platform is not trusted. The two parties to a deal still need to trust each other.

Yes. If people aren't going on vacations or building new homes, then resources (electricity, labor, gas, construction materials, etc.) that would have been used on those consumer goods are available for entrepreneurs and investors.
This is why focusing on consumer spending is "pushing on thread." If everyone spent all their money on consumer goods, there would be no resources left over for investment in capital goods. Saving, hoarding, and investing allow resources to be freed from consumer spending resulting in lower prices for those resources and thus facilitating more capital investment.

But in this analogy the bank can't steal your money or spend it. The worst that would happen is the "bank" doesn't fulfill the transactions that you request, in which you just wait for the LN transaction time to close out and your transactions are finalized on chain.
@_date: 2016-12-23 15:13:09
Probably correct. Those people hate Austrian economics. Why save money when we can just spend our way to prosperity with ever increasing debt and consumer spending?!
@_date: 2016-12-28 14:03:45


They would invest because with the additional capital goods they could produce more cheaply and increase their products. The key part is that resources required for investment are cheaper, so it doesn't cost as much to invest is capital goods.


I never said that mattress-stuffing is an ideal form on investment or savings. In fact it's actually one of the worst forms of savings from the view on the person doing the savings. My point is only that mattress-stuffing doesn't cause economy-wide problems -- investing, production of capital goods, and growth still occur if people hoard their cash. There is no need for any government controlled inflation to discourage hoarding and ensure economic growth.

How is bitcoin any different? Both bitcoin and gold allow the economy to use a basic, un-manipulated resource as money.

Why should people need to play the Wall St casino to keep their savings? This is why Wall St has so much money and power, the Fed forces people to invest their money in the stock market.
@_date: 2016-12-23 14:21:12
Saving money (even if it's just stashed under a mattress) removes the money from the economy in the sense that it's not being spend on goods and services. This reduced spending (less demand) creates deflationary pressure -- thus lowering prices and reducing demand on resources. This means that businesses have more resources available for production.

It matters to people who save money.
That value that's stored in savings is lost by inflation. The lost value is taken by the people doing the inflation (Federal Reserve and their buddies in the government and finance).
@_date: 2016-12-21 14:01:18


Inflation benefits those who get the money soonest. They get to spend the newly printed money before the effects of prices increases spread throughout the economy. 


Inflation discourages saving and distorts the market. "Yesterday work" is savings which is critical to investing in capital and growing the economy. If inflation is good for the economy, they why isn't higher inflation (stagflation of the 70s or periods of hyper inflation)?

BTC goes to $10,000 a coin but one of your 10 people loses his part of the key. Say goodbye to your gains.
@_date: 2017-05-09 17:07:02
That's really your only option if you want to be able to spend any decent gains. Or you can buy a hundred in few Amazon gift cards and keep low on the radar.

Yeah, SPV clients don't check the underlying protocol of the nodes they connect to.
I was referring more to full clients that don't upgrade at all and will reject any chain with blocks greater than 1 MB.
@_date: 2017-07-19 17:28:24
I agree. Any protocol change that isn't backwards compatible (ex: 1+ MB blocks) is technically a hard fork. To a non-mining client, they see a bunch of invalid blocks and a different chain which they will reject.
If not a single miner stays on the old protocol, then there is no chain split. Otherwise there will be different chains with different blocks that different clients will recognize.
@_date: 2017-07-19 17:24:45


Clients won't follow the longest chain if that chain is considered invalid (1+ MB block sizes). If after the 2MB hard fork, some clients didn't upgrade, they would be left with no miners to confirm their transactions.

This isn't about coffee, it's about freeing the world from central banks.
If we want bitcoin to replace all fiat currencies it needs to accommodate 7.5 billion people performing multiple transactions per day. For that we need all sorts of scaling (lighting network, larger blocks, etc).
