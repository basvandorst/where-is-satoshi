Does this mean it is time to get out of investing? 
Since people who do not understand it are getting into the space.
Also, on the topic of age... is it super weird or creepy to think Erik Finman is a cutie pie for someone who is 10 years older than him? ..lol :/

How is Bitcoin better than IOTA or the Tangle at what you explained above? 
(I am genuinely curious and not trying to start any drama or being a smart ass... I know most people are, and throw comments like that to upset people (people do it to me aaaall theeee time) but I'm just trying to learn)  
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:53:58
what exchange do you use?
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:04:51
thanks for your reply. 
What do you think about the miners in Bitcoin? Aren't there too few as it is? As far as decentralization is concerned... 
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:04:22
I made posts/questions about this danger for people in the space before and people downvoted me...

Thanks for sharing. I am a first generation immigrant and I understand. 
Here is my quick little story.... I lost my debit card and ran out of cash a couple of weekends ago, and I couldn't get any cash from the bank on the weekend...  a little less annoying but annoying anyway

Why do you think most people there aren't having 2 kids minimum?

Yes, and be more welcoming to women. We are 50% of the population with purchasing power.

Typical airhead psychopath reading off a promoter pretending to be happy and stable and well intentioned. 
Contrast this to Andreas way of speaking for example. You can tell he is a real person who is outraged at many things.... not a narcissistic psychopath like Ver.

Hi... I'm sorry about this! I just thought it would bring some positivity and lulz to the forum. Didn't mean to put you on the spot. 
Your talks are incredible.

I hope BTC succeeds. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:01:05
the real question is... 
If I'm pro BTC and not supporting other altcoins, why do I always get downvoted or deleted in this forum?
Seems counterintuitive... 
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:10:13
yess!!!! 
que se vayan a la chingada :p 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:47:52
what makes you think so?
I mean the very pop culture TV show Big Bang theory is having an episode about BTC tomorrow.... My friends abroad who aren't technical people at all (less than I am) already used it before me...

That's pretty cool. My comment was just the sort of sarcastic small talk comment that usually tends to get laughs or likes on Reddit though, and I meant nothing bad by it.  I apologize if you were offended. 
Maybe I'm just a little bitter and trying to get some wisdom and advise from other intelligent Redditors such as yourself, because I used to work at a software company that was basically a frat house and I got fired when I was super quiet, respectful and never on FB on the work computer, when that was the norm for others, even people hired way after me... My productivity was also objectively higher than most. 
I think my mistake was pointing out to some of my peers that there was a lot of bias and you could get away with things depending on who you were, regardless of title or productivity, but more based on popularity... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I was later told by people still at the company that they absolutely do not understand how I was the one to be let go and how others who have a fraction of the productivity are still there. 
I was quiet and never gave any sass back to VERY rude people as well (people were commenting on how I got yelled at for no reason once or twice, by someone who literally made new hires quit, not even exaggerating, and this woman is dumb as a box of rocks, just friends with the boss)  ... I was not born in the US... so there's a clue! Also being overly polite must be like holding a sign above my head that says "be shitty to me" 
But they actually did me a favor bc I then had the time to learn about BTC.

Guys, question: 
Is it safe to buy on Coinbase with your real identity? 
(we all know how the powers that be will do anything against whatever threatens them) :/
Is it better to buy anonymously somehow? Localbitcoins for example? Other options? 
Also, remember this video? Relevant...

Aren't you suspicious that the countries in most need of it are banning it? 
Do you really think it is "freedom" in the countries that haven't yet banned it?
I wouldn't underestimate the power and interconnections of govt officials between each other...

Does anybody think that the current price has been over inflated by whales and banks who are just waiting for people like some of us to keep buying little by little and then will dump it at some point? 
I feel like the price is quite high and I don't know how much I can believe the exponential growth theory as much as it would be nice. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 00:09:15
what if Bitcoin is a concerted effort by some institutions to fool individual users? 
As in.... all those coins that 'Satoshi' has, could be dumped at some point after a lot more people bought Bitcoin?
(Please explain, I'm new so I'm sorry if this sounds completely dumb)
