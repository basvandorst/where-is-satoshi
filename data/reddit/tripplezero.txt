It's not really a myth. The more you look into it, the more corruption becomes evident.
Maybe it's not fully privately owned but it is to an extent. And I'm sure there is some interest involved..it's not as simple as printing money and giving it away.
@_date: 2014-04-04 08:44:39
Costly indeed..there's still a certain cost to produce each dollar as well.
Well if you believe any of the conspiracy of the RFID chips in humans for monetary and and identification purposes, you can kinda say they've considered some form of digital currency.  A private - public ledger would be great but seems unlikely.
This is why bitcoin is great. Not as prone to the same levels of corruption...at least not yet. Makes a lot more sense to me.
@_date: 2014-10-15 22:19:50
What an ass hole that guy is. That whole post sounds like he got super butt hurt and became defensive instead of proactive. Like he's was trying to convince the public that it was somehow the customers fault when everything has already been posted to show it was his.

Because stocks deal a lot with buying low and seeing high, much like bitcoin. They are like stocks that you can buy stuff with..Lol. A debit card is kinda a lot different than bitcoin other than the fact you can buy stuff with it.
@_date: 2014-04-04 07:05:50
I would really like to know how they consider themselves public other than the fact they are publicly known and that they create currency of which eventually reaches the public.


So even with only 5%, there are still $27 million worth of money created a day. Honestly, I have no doubt that there is a lot of corruption among the federal reserve and international bankers. For that reason, I don't take much of what they have to say about themselves too seriously. It's almost like Mark Karpeles in regards to mt.gox. Somehow I don't think it would be hard for them to lie about numbers or to leave a few out by 'accident'.

Let me just paste what someone else said in another thread:


* walk into bank, ask for a card. They ask for your account information. Well shit, ask to open an account. 
* sign in, wait an hour for the one rep to get to you. 
* spend an hour trying to understand the fee structure, and dodging all the up-sell attempts. 
* provide every possible piece of information that could be used to identify you. Wait while they check with the government to see if you're a terrorist. 
* deposit your money into your account. 
* (at some banks) wait at week for atm card to be mailed to you. 
* go back to atm to withdraw the funds you deposited. 
* find out there is $250 limit, and pay a $1 or more in fees. 


While the guys in that video appear to have done little research beforehand. Also, that bitcoin atm does require a lot of information, so does just about any form of banking.

Well the federal reserve is independent but controlled by private banks. Not a whole lot different. Just a bunch of beating around the bush.
Well it does say that 'However, the Federal Reserve is subject to oversight by the Congress, which often reviews the Federal Reserve's activities and can alter its responsibilities by statute.'  In the end, not much has changed.

Facts...pffft. overrated. Lol
@_date: 2014-04-04 19:39:37
But are you forgetting what is necessary to use an atm? You've gotta sign up at the bank first.
They get your state id, you're social, and proof that you live where you say you do. Regardless of biometrics, they most certainly identify you as who you are. This is all necessary before even receiving an atm card. You don't have to give biometric data because they have already have everything they need to identify you. Plus you're physically in front of them with several cameras watching you.
While the bitcoin atms might be from smaller start-ups and we might not know what they are really doing with that data, even big banks and institutions are prone to security issues. Like the Target credit card info leak.
I highly doubt you pay no fees. There is at least a certain amount you must have in your account to avoid fees. Unless you bank at USAA (or somewhere similar). 
I'm not arguing the fact that, that bitcoin atm was a little intensive. I would never do all that. I'm sure they'll get better over time and I'm sure not all of them are that crazy. There are several other ways to obtain bitcoins without giving so much information.
I honestly can't tell if you're a troll or not. I don't even know why I'm responding to this since all of your arguments are ignorant and moot, but atms and a bank accounts are one in the same. You can't just walk up to an atm and get cash without a bank or credit account associated with a card. You want to act like you were born with a atm card in your hand, that was ready to go. This simply isn't the case. From the perspective of someone who has absolutely no bank account or bitcoin wallet, it would only take a matter of minutes to create a bitcoin wallet and add coins to it while setting up a bank account can take hours and you will likely have to wait for your atm card in the mail. Not to mention some charges don't show up on your online statement, sometimes for days.
You sound like you don't know much about bitcoin, let alone banks and atms.

It made me think of how shitty the American dollar is becoming. The federal reserve is a joke as a privately owned bank that 'lends' money to the U.S. with interest on every dollar. This alone makes me think it would literally be impossible to get out of debt without giving property or land away.
Before I leaned about bitcoin, I already had a grudge against the American dollar and the federal reserve. With the amount of evidence out there to suggest the American dollar could collapse at any time, I was very eager to invest in gold/silver and even ran across the idea of exchanging U.S. dollars for some other currency of which is more stable. And thought bitcoin wouldn't likely be considered stable, it's a godsend in my eyes. I already had all my why's for bitcoin long before I found it. Due to this video, I think I'll approach the subject of bitcoin differently when explaining it to someone new.

This is partially why i almost prefer egifter. They let you get gift cards for any interval of $5, which is extremely convenient as with gyft, i sometimes have to buy multiple cards or spend more than necessary due to 25 dollar money intervals. Their barcodes are also regular barcodes.

@_date: 2014-04-02 18:57:13
For the most part, it is tho.
Here's straight from the federal reserve website:
The Federal Reserve System fulfills its public mission as an independent entity within government.  It is not "owned" by anyone and is not a private, profit-making institution.As the nation's central bank, the Federal Reserve derives its authority from the Congress of the United States. It is considered an independent central bank because its monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the President or anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government, it does not receive funding appropriated by the Congress, and the terms of the members of the Board of Governors span multiple presidential and congressional terms.However, the Federal Reserve is subject to oversight by the Congress, which often reviews the Federal Reserve's activities and can alter its responsibilities by statute. Therefore, the Federal Reserve can be more accurately described as "independent within the government" rather than "independent of government."The 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks, which were established by the Congress as the operating arms of the nation's central banking system, are organized similarly to private corporations--possibly leading to some confusion about "ownership." For example, the Reserve Banks issue shares of stock to member banks. However, owning Reserve Bank stock is quite different from owning stock in a private company. The Reserve Banks are not operated for profit, and ownership of a certain amount of stock is, by law, a condition of membership in the System. The stock may not be sold, traded, or pledged as security for a loan; dividends are, by law, 6 percent per year.
So they aren't private but are independent. None of their decisions have to be ratified by the president or anyone of legislation. And it gives its shareholders 6% every year(of which I'm sure is a decent profit). And it's shareholders are all private banks. They have total control to do what they want with a nation's money.
The way I initially said it might have been a little skewed, but really not far from the truth at all.

4 queens. I didn't want to pay the extra to stay at the golden nugget. I'm going for punk rock bowling and started at the 4 queens last year with no complaints, so I'm sure it'll be fine.
But through the use of cheap air, you can stay just about anywhere in Vegas. Gyft also has gift cards for the 'global hotel card' and Hyatt hotels. Plus there are a few other services to get hotels with bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-06-26 20:15:39
The coney island hot dog place attached to the d hotel also accepts bitcoins. Pretty cool. Lol
@_date: 2014-04-15 06:33:37
The same could be said for using the cards at a lot of places. For some reason CVS has a rule against accepting coupons or discounts on the phone and because of that, and the managers usually being old and not understanding technology. I swear, if a younger person is working, they try to scan it and realize it's not a normal barcode, plus I'll tell them they have to enter it in, they'll usually enter it without issues. I've had an old lady and an old guy try and turn me away, when i mention that i just used it there the other day without issues they seem to change their minds, for the time being. They've always accepted it, reluctant, none the less but they did eventually tell me i had to print it out, as if anything was different since it was the same exact barcode and numbers and everything. Lol..it's definitely not a problem with gyft, it's the merchants. They need to get with the picture and I don't think that's asking very much.
@_date: 2014-04-07 01:33:12

I'm fairly sure the sources weren't sponsored by gold/silver but I have seen ones that were. And even according to most, the dollar was supposed to have collapsed several times and is still around. I do, though, somewhat understand what's going on and I can't see how it could last forever.
And maybe it did seem a little odd...i never did invest in either. 
@_date: 2014-08-26 21:58:13
Damn. Did America ever get this discount? Cuz I'm a little upset if i missed out..Lol
@_date: 2014-02-21 08:18:16
I believe that in certain exchanges, they are hit with limitations as to how much money they can withdraw a month (or whatever increment). Or the amount of transactions they are able to have, then adding restriction and then whoever doesn't make the cut is added to a queued list. It wouldn't be hard to get pretty backed up if this were the case.
Not sure how correct this is.Lol
@_date: 2014-04-04 09:08:56

I believe there is another plug-in that works just like the one you mentioned. Aside from plugins, you can always use Gyft or EGifter to purchase a gift certificate.
I believe the egifter website lets you pick the amount down to the dollar.
And then there are services like BitSumo which let you order from just about any website, depending on what it is you're ordering. They just take your coins and pay for the stuff with their own credit cards, and put your address down as the shipping address.
But yeah, supporting a company that openly accepts btc is anyways nice.

Well you could get a gift card through gyft or egifter for Amazon. I'm sure they have a digital download mp3 version. There are alternatively, a few other ways to pay with bitcoin on Amazon.
You could also get a gift card to target or somewhere and buy a physical copy of the CD. There could be a better option, but that's just off the top of my head, no Google. Lol

People have been stealing money for ever. It's easy to lose your coins to a thief but also easy to be robbed for your wallet. Both can be avoided but you can never say, without a doubt, that neither will ever happen.
At least bitcoin can't be counterfeited. I've always wondered if there are counterfeit bills that are so good, they are real.

That's like saying wiping your prints off a stolen car before you ditch it is a red flag. If you're being investigated, you better hope you've been tumbling and not just sending straight to coinbase. While it might make it somewhat obvious that you're trying to hide something, which would raise suspicion, it does actually hide it and if it's found again, who it belonged to would have to be proven again. Of course tumbling would lead to more investigation. That's because without it, no further investigating will be needed if the wallet is attached to your name or something else identifying. Of course wiping your prints and leaving a clean trail leads to more investigation, if you care to catch who you're looking for at least.

I was thinking because Gyft offers Kmart, cvs, target, ect. gift cards, some of theose places sell gift cards for other stores like best buy and Starbucks. Could you just buy a gift card of your choice with with a Gyft card for, say, target? I was wondering if that would work
