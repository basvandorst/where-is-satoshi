How about: "legal corruption"?
@_date: 2015-06-28 20:21:47
interesting counterpoint
@_date: 2015-06-28 06:41:26
The whole "Greek effect" could be a self-fulfilling prophecy.
@_date: 2015-06-27 05:32:12
Nice :)

don't miners want the price go up?
@_date: 2015-06-19 03:04:18
Is there a list of videos of all the hearings?
I'd like to watch some of them.
@_date: 2015-06-10 14:08:07
also, I suppose if the price went up, more miners would come on the market thereby decreasing the current mining share of current miners.
@_date: 2015-06-28 20:16:06
I think this is true for most cases.
I haven't really had the chance to talk to those I know who, for example, work in banking or something. I'm interested to see what they think of it.
Incidentally, I heard of bitcoin through someone who worked in the banking industry (IT).

You know, after being interested in cryptocurrency for a while now, I am now realizing the irony of hiding cash under your mattress
If you really have so little faith in your local banks to keep your money, why have faith that the currency itself will keep its value?
There may not be a direct causal link between banks foreclosing and the currency devaluing, but it seems to me that there is some correlation (ie Cyprus, and other countries where the governments seize assets from banks).
Of course, I'm not saying it is wise to save anything under your mattress, just wanted to point this out.
@_date: 2015-06-21 23:33:01
Yes, thats a good point.
@_date: 2015-06-14 19:43:00
Thanks for sharing :)
@_date: 2015-06-10 13:53:18
I hope so :(

yeah, he is trying to emulate a financial model specified by Muhammad.
However, even though your comment is incorrect in this context, it is definitely true in many other cases.
@_date: 2015-06-28 00:58:57
good point
@_date: 2015-06-28 17:49:31
We can always dream ;)

You're going to need to count on the wisdom of the crowd if bitcoin is going to really take over.  ;) hehe
@_date: 2015-03-04 09:45:12
they were talking about australia, not the developing world.
I don't know why its okay to talk about bitcoin in the developing world, but for some reason its not okay to talk about it in the developed world.
Why don't you start a thread about bitcoin in the developing world? It would be very interesting.
@_date: 2015-03-02 16:53:32
bitcoin has whatever value people perceive it to have.
If it crashed to 1 bitcoin for 20 us dollars, it would still be a useful payment mechanism.

it looks like the hive wallet for mac is written in objective-c, not java.
@_date: 2015-02-17 15:17:39
is that really so 'wrong'?
Prove how that is such a bad thing
@_date: 2015-02-17 16:13:35
Its wrong to publicize?
You are publicizing your views right now, is that wrong?
And this is assuming that this donation will generate income down the road for andreas. All in all, if this gentleman needed to do this consistently in order to get speaking contracts, he probably would lose money.

"candidates should be ambivalent about working for us".
Since when did working for a large company be such a bad thing anyways?

there's a difference between a programmer/developer and a coder.
learning to do some basic scripting is almost always a good thing/
@_date: 2015-02-25 06:45:19
Yeah what's going on? Why don't these companies try to make their company an attractive place to work instead of hiring people that don't want to work there?

a few thousand btc or dollars in btc?
@_date: 2015-02-18 00:55:01
Hi :)
@_date: 2015-02-17 00:02:43
I disagree with almost everything in this post!
I think we should stop the tipping culture in the restaurant industry however.
@_date: 2015-02-11 05:25:57
this is pretty funny! I don't know why
@_date: 2015-02-17 15:48:07
you have never been selfish before?
You are saying that if someone contributes to someone in public (without anything in exchange) it is for selfish reasons?
@_date: 2015-02-25 07:01:27
you can have side-chain or off the block loans which are quote-on-quote "created from thin air"

If you take out the 2014 bubble it follows pretty regular growth
