There’s a guy on YouTube who says Bitconnect is 100% solid and legit.  He listed his referral code if you want to signup LOL.

All these youtubers with $100,000’s worth of coins are getting targeted by hackers and losing huge chunks of their crypto money.  I’m amazed these youtubers are not tracked down and targeted by gangs.  In real life to.
Probably only a matter of time.

You’ve invested wisely, that $3000 won’t hurt if it’s one day worth $100.  And it could one day be worth $30,000+.  That’s the only way to invest right now.  Money you can afford to throw away.

If you want to invest in bitcoin or alt coins, make sure it’s throw away money you can easily forget about if it’s all gone.  That $40k is NOT throw away money.

Yeah it’s a real pain buying in Australia.  Bitcoin prices are inflated here by 10%.  Buy on Coinbase.com and you’ll only be allowed to buy $300 first week and $500 the second week.  Not sure about 3rd week.  That’s off your credit card.
If you want to use the best exchange then use BTCMARKETS.net, they have some of the cheapest prices and decent volume and well setup.  But new accounts they send you a snail mail letter to verifying your really living in your own house.  And even when verified your only allowed to Bpay $2000 a day to your account.  You can ask for increase after you’ve done some transactions.
So anyways good luck I tried to buy $80k when BTC was at $10k.  I ended up stuck for 2 weeks and only was able to buy $1000 worth which is now worth $1250.  Sucks but gotta build up accounts slowly here.

I’m thinking of dropping 1-2% of my networth into bitcoins and other crypto.  If I lose 2% if my net worth I won’t hardly notice it gone.  But that 2% could grow substantially if I buy the right coins and this keeps going up.

Buy a new keyboard?  Double check Everything 3 Times, send amounts in smaller batches to make sure it’s safe and working first couple of times your sending money around.  If your buying to hold, just take it off to a cold wallet like a ledger s Nano and your set.

In Australia we are having a multi billion dollar banking network upgrade installed next year.  It will allow instant transfers betweeen people at all banks.
“this new system will allow customers of financial institutions connected to the platform to make or receive payments to each other in less than a minute, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year”
Bitcoin has its uses I’m sure but many of the things people want from it will be achieved without needing it.

In other words the price is going up so fast they set a price for a game and by the time the person clicks buy it’s already gone up 1.5% LOL.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:43:31
That’s a good option I’ve been looking at too.  Some prices are pretty decent too when it’s rising fast.  And people haven’t updated their sell orders.

The dollars not going to lose half it’s value by Monday bro.  Not saying bitcoin will, but it ‘could’.

Thanks very much for the link.  ��

How do you do this?  What wallet and settings to you use?  Anywhere I can read to learn how to do this?

Knew yesterday it was going to come down.  Simply because basic psychology of fear of the unknown.  Flight to safety (dollars) when you don’t know what’s happening with Futures.

Yep one guy has 120k followers and after making $700k in bitconnect referrals.  He now pushes Hashflare to his customers. Hashflare has no photos of their servers, and looks like another ponzi.  These youtubers are just scammers without commuting the crime.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:12:07
True I was joking.  Yes bitcoin is no good for transactions like Steam until the lightning network upgrade or something to keep fees heap and transactions fast.
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:20:51
Exactly, count on whatever you invest to be gone.  This coin can lose 80% if it’s value overnight if the right things happen.  Only invest what you can totally afford to lose and be happy losing.

It’s only a problem if they work as shoe shine boys.

I plan to buy next week, hopefully it’s not $13k by then
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:05:37
That’s cool, question though.  If I have 1 bitcoin and my seed 24 word number is a set bunch of words.  If I add 2 more bitcoin into the hardware wallet.  Do I need to create another 24 word phrase that encodes and knows all my new private keys?   
So if I lost my trezor or ledger Nano s k could rebuild a new one with the 24 word phrase.  Im guessing if that’s how it works then every time I update my wallet the 24 word phrase would change?

Why get married it’s just a transfer of power to her.  If your American you need your head checked if your considering marriage unless you enjoy slavery.

Agreed it’s a crap shoot and mistakes can be costly.  I’m still new but I’m going to pay the extra fee’s for some rest transactions before I move big lumps.  Too much risk with a mistake.
The buy the new keyboard was kind of a joke I do understand your issue here about safety.
