what if u have a farm with several miners? You need to set different address for each?
@_date: 2016-08-29 14:19:12
thanks for the reply. But if 2 separated miners that are close to each other (topology speaking) and have the same TXs list - they both start with nonce and advance it +1
So I was just wondering how the miners are not stepping on each other toes from time to time? Time stamp in the header slightly different? I guess also the first TX in the block (the miner address, forgot how it is called :) is different - so the markle tree will for sure be different - like belcher_ mentioned
@_date: 2016-08-29 12:57:19
Two mining-related questions:
1. Is there any technical reason of choosing smaller-than target and not greater-than as a difficulty?
2. When a miner builds the next candidate block and creates a hash out of it (header+transactions), will that hash change if only the TXs order will be different?
I am asking that cuz I want to know how the protocol is designed to make sure that 2 or more miners that have the same TXs are not "trying" out the same hashes
@_date: 2017-02-04 20:35:31
why that seems to be the case?
@_date: 2017-02-04 20:30:47
so you are saying that blockchain, as a public utility has failed?
@_date: 2016-11-21 08:50:17


Not every use-case needs them as the ultimate and above all characteristics of the underlying technology - the blockchain. You know that they come with a trade-off for speed and flexibility, and that is where ethereum comes to place.
You have other factors as well, one of which is the cost of transactions. If you need to broadcast few hundred TXs every week, it will be much cheaper to do that on ethereum than on bitcoin.
When we will have layers above the Bitcoin blockchain that will be able to meet that need, we can argue which one will be better to use.
As for the bailout fork ethereum did few months ago - I think it was a mistake because the flow was not on the protocol level, but in some poor written smart contract.
It still does not change the fact that both chains can co-exist.

At first glimpse I thought you mean United States.
And I was like whaaat? No way it starts there

You can't seriously compare Counterparty community, devs, and funding with the one Ethereum has. You can be against Ethereum, or not believe in it, but you can't deny the robust community, development, funds and companies behind it.
@_date: 2016-11-05 21:55:38
thanks! will have a look there
@_date: 2016-12-04 18:17:12
Your post is indeed long, and I didn't read it. I just want to ask you this:
If you are not happy with this ICO, or it seems fishy, why don't you just move on?
@_date: 2016-11-20 12:12:45
You have 19, not 18 reasons. So which one is the trojan?


Check this out:
@_date: 2016-12-11 19:21:09
not reputation, but TRUST. Nothing stops trezor to do the same trick their next update, or Electrum, or any other service provider
@_date: 2016-11-20 18:04:19
So far I can say the same for your posts.
Care to explain?
@_date: 2016-11-20 16:19:07
That's what they are building - etf and ctf. They will launch 2 funds - index funds -  and performance.fund which will be actively managed and will focus on ICOs in the crypto and blockchain area. The last one is already active (first investment was in Golem) and is pre-seeded with ~4.5M usd
In few months the final version of the platform should be released - the Open Fund Management platform, where anybody can be a fund manager, an investor, or both.

So what? The internet is a subset of TCP/IP. Which one is "more important"? Just like TCP enables the Internet and becomes the underlying infrastructure protocol, it will soon be the same with Bitcoin, and later on with all application layers that will be built on top of the bitcoin blockchain.
We are evolving

I think he won't move that solo-mined stash. It will make no sense to build something so unique and then destroy it.
I do believe he joined the mining as one of the early adopters, so he probably has his respectful stash of bitcoins.

Did you really bought something for more than $3,700 without understanding it?
If you keep them on blockchain.info DO set 2FA (not SMS - google auth or yubikey) and second password. And don't use the same passwords as your email

If I won't find until then I will ping you for sure
@_date: 2016-11-20 17:52:52
why? Because it was posted on BTC subreddit?
@_date: 2016-12-14 11:21:53
Soon they will switch to digital cash with 100% control and surveillance.
I hope that bitcoin infrastructure and services will be ready in time to welcome those who don't want to be under government surveillance 24/7.

some of them include ATB Financial, Thomson Reuters, UBS, Santander, also Microsoft sponsored DevCon2

and still the entire crypto market cap is the size of mcdonald's.
So much room to grow
@_date: 2016-12-06 20:24:56
Bitcoin price and market cap reflect the extend to which people are willing to see Bitcoin as a store of value. If that would be the only or overwhelming factor in terms of price, then public blockchain as technology has failed.

You se eit wrong, tcp is not the Internet.
@_date: 2016-12-19 13:26:04
For people outside crypto it is almost impossible to understand and follow all alt coins and app tokens out there. Not to mention managing wallets and private keys.
Price volatility can be scary for traditional investors and fund managers.
[Crypto index]( and managed funds should be the gateway for traditional fiat investors that have way way more money to invest than the entire crypto market cap.
[Iconomi]( can be a good entry point for them.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:48:15
I'd prefer if this fork would go as planned. A much better outcome for Bitcoin would be to show everyone that these attempts to hijack Bitcoin will always fail
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:11:22
I would be ashamed to be the owner of such a cruppy exchange. Engine and UI are a disgrace.  
@_date: 2016-12-01 19:00:26
they got the public ledger part right. Give them few more years and they will sort out the "encrypted" part as well.
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:40:40
Mmm, no. There are index funds that outperform Bitcoin.

Technically 33% is enough
@_date: 2018-02-12 09:10:12
Never said it's easy. All I said that if you control the FW, 33% is enough
So with one pool that has 33% the system is not Byzantine fault tolerant.
@_date: 2017-09-28 06:20:43
When.. not if
@_date: 2018-02-12 08:35:41
If you control 33% of the hashing power in a world with firewalls, you can theoretically attack the network.
@_date: 2018-02-12 08:46:59
If you block the communication between the other 2 parties you can gain control over the network.

mm, I believe eth price dropped by 50% after the hack
@_date: 2016-10-08 17:59:41
why would it be automatically considered as 51% attack?
Can't I control 51% of the hashing power and be honest?

Interesting days ahead of us

My personal opinion: SIA, Iconomi, Ethereum, Aragon,Incent.. 
Truth is no one knows how all this will play out. I am just enjoying the ride and keep my money on the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-05-08 16:54:19
When will you fix your crappy UI?
@_date: 2017-05-22 07:02:46
Hmm, even doggie is pumping. Sia did x20 and pretty much every other alt. It's not that they all had an amazing technological breakthrough or met a major milestone. The entire market is pumped, and I don't say it as something bad
@_date: 2017-05-22 07:08:58
I never said a bubble, but over valuated. Some of the alts have really good and promising techs
@_date: 2017-05-10 05:57:02
You need 2 tabs to submit a buy order. 
How much BTC I had? Hmm, what is the last buy/sell ?
Ooh, damn, I put 0.00001 BTC more than I have in my buy order, why did it let me fill it all the way to the confirmation just to tell me that?
Why does the order book need to be manually refreshed? Can't it be updated on the fly?
And I can go on and on..
Common, the UX sucks
@_date: 2017-05-22 05:56:28
99% of all alts are over valuated, ICOs get 20M USD in few minutes
