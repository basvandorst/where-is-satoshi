What is that pile of filth next to your name? 
@_date: 2018-09-06 15:05:54
Sell 1/3 of your position and add a stop loss to new lows. 
Then you'll still have some if it rises,  if not,  you'll still have your profits taken plus your stop loss

If your good at trading tho you can easily pass anyone who got into btc early
@_date: 2018-08-26 02:48:25
Lol not when u have eyes and access to charts. Pretty easy to spot price dips versus price highs. 
@_date: 2018-08-25 01:31:22
Use weekly chart and buy at low 
@_date: 2019-03-23 16:41:42
No. It's not a smart investment I don't care whether or not you think btc is the future there's no clear signs in that happening and even less in it growing drastically in value. 
Buying stock of a stable,  fast growing company is a smart investment. Buying realstate is a smart investment. But btc is NOT a smart investment.  Only speculative and only a dream. Many of you are holding onto it in the hopes it makes you rich which is much the same concept of a lottery ticket.

Never unless it started to show signs of strength again in which Id just buy in for a short term profit on all the FOMO. But that's all it be. FOMO moving the price up. 
@_date: 2019-03-23 16:17:38
Or they lose that $500 
@_date: 2019-03-23 17:00:37
Exactly. It's way to iffy to be putting seriously money in as an investment 
@_date: 2019-03-23 17:01:09
Everyone knows the concept. It's the fact whether or not it actually comes through and does anything. 
@_date: 2019-03-23 16:16:43
Or it goes to zero. Guess that's where the luck will come in 
@_date: 2019-03-23 22:38:46
I trade options for a living. My main tool is charts. I see the data. 
@_date: 2019-03-23 16:18:11
It's not a smart investment. It's a very risky,  just for fun,  investment 
@_date: 2019-03-23 16:50:51
I realize. I'm not totally anti BTC investing unless it's life changing money for someone. Then that's very dangerous and noone should be doing that. But if you have some $ you wanna toss in for fun then go for it. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 01:27:01
Yeah I've known that for years, I'm pretty confident it's more than 90%. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 20:52:16
Lmao they just gonna save it all for it's next big run then cash out 
@_date: 2018-06-10 23:07:17
That's why you wait on breakouts during consolidation then trade in the direction of the break
@_date: 2018-06-11 03:42:21
Stop loss... Underneath the dip you think is present... 
@_date: 2018-06-01 20:52:56
They can if they hold btc for it's next run
@_date: 2018-06-11 03:27:22
Well that's what stop losses are for
@_date: 2019-02-25 03:10:17
I know but it is still not a sustainable currency right now therefore people don't want to use it. We'll see what happens in the coming months/years. 
@_date: 2019-02-09 01:55:50
Lol how many of you are still in the hole tho?  
Nothing short of holding on to a lottery ticket when you just "believe" it will sky rocket 
@_date: 2019-02-23 18:48:11
I love the concept of btc,  don't get me wrong. But it's not a substainable currency with it's massive price swings. Why would any business/consumer want to use it when your money can change in value drastically in just the course of a week?  
Not worth it and not gonna be happening anytime soon. Really at this point there's no reason to be paying with btc. 
@_date: 2019-02-23 18:50:47
Exactly. Btc a gimmick for sustainable use. Why would any business owner/consumer take the risk of having their money change in value drastically over the course of a week due to btcs price fluctuations. At this point there is litteraly no reason to use btc either than to say you bought something with btc for fun. 
@_date: 2019-02-09 01:57:53
Why even bother volatility dead better off trading stocks 
@_date: 2019-02-23 22:14:47
How does this have anything to do with what I said 
@_date: 2019-02-10 00:44:24
Could've posted this every month for the last year�� whens it gonna stop dipping guys?  
@_date: 2018-11-29 01:51:13
Have a look at your own comments. I was mostly speaking because of the volatility it's had this last few days traders are making a lot of money. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:53:15
We broke the most major daily support we had. So,  yeah,  I shorted at 5600. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:00:23
Haha easy bud why is there so much hostility in this sub,  jealousy maybe? 
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:37:01
It's a profession,  despite feeling like you can learn through free Google searches I recom Ned actually paying someone to teach you. Lots of course a online 
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:43:07
Lol it's dead. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 23:00:59
All bitcoin ATM have ridiculous fees and are seriously not worth using compared to a regular ATM.  
Plus the volatility of bitcoin is just ridiculous to ever want to actually use it as a currency.  $1000BTC  today, $2000 next month $500 2 months. Where as $1000 cash  will still have the same buying power as $1000 in 2 months. 
It will simply never work as a currency, atleast not a very good one.
@_date: 2018-11-28 17:36:22
This is why I love knowing how to trade and actually being good at it. You wouldn't believe the amounts of money traders are making during this time 
@_date: 2019-01-05 01:29:49
Were all rich in hindsight. There are dozens of stocks/investment oppurtunities right now except you'll never know until it's too late. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 04:24:54
I'm pretty sure it's a much different case than the start of the internet..... Plus I don't disagree with the idea behind bitcoin,  just it's super illogical to be used right now 
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:36:26
I don't invest
