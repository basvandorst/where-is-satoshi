I went through this same situation with coinbase, verified bank a year ago, thought "WTF?!" when it took a week to get coins after buying.
Then I realized, you have to give them your credit card for their "Know Your Customer" rules and then the purchases become nearly instant.
This is all the same as Paypal, BTW. Just have to jump through the hoops with a new payment processor. It's just laws they are following.

Are you able to help provide explanation for this?

You don't need the credit card each time, you just need to setup your account with it. Just like Paypal. Lots of people choose to use PP over a credit card directly. You also don't have to use coinbase, that is the beauty of Bitcoin. It's decentralized so you can buy some from anybody and choose to use it in the way that you see fit. You don't need to rely on anyone. You could even just mine it yourself.

In terms of raw computing power, it is larger than any other distributed computing project in existence. Bittorrent is not a p2p network in and of itself. Each torrent becomes it's own p2p network of individuals seeding or leeching that torrent. Torrent trackers manage the torrents themselves.

I think you are spot on with your assessment, but I believe that the currency will have strong support at reasonable levels always and any such crashes will simply be elliot waves to be calculated to lots and lots of people. What goes up, can come down, but always goes back up again (and goes down, and goes up...) :-)
Learn to day trade folks!

Go read the links. People are posting quick payout ponzi schemes on the Bitcoin marketplace. It's like gambling, but you have some control over the outcome because of internet technology. Check them out here:

Just compare your odds versus the established gaming systems. And this market is in it's infancy!
