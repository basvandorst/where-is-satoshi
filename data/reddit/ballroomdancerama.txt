That's what I was thinking as well, from what I've read about from how it works. Bitcoin or crypto in general allows for an ungoverned unregulated currency to traded from person to person without an institution. This seems so cool to me because no specific body can control how the market works.

How likely is it that Bitcoin will die though? As it stands, major company are starting to roll out Bitcoin as an accepted currency. Also heard a rumour that Walmart is in the works as well.

agreed, it feels like even though bitcoin and crypto had a great year overall, people are looking at the $20,000 peak and pointing to the $13,000 low

How would that work though? People have put real cash to purchase crypto so it's not like there isn't actual funds in the system. I have heard of certain altcoins dying off but i'm unsure of how that process works.

Could you elaborate that on just a bit. I read up on social engineering a long time ago and it really surprised me just how prevalent it is in our society especially with the boom of social medai.

a time paradox was created

Which is kind of surprising to me. There's ETH and LTC which are also quite big now. It feels like if BTC ever dies, people will just hop over to the next currency available. BTC was the first afterall
