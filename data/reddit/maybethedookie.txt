Talk to a CPA. It's worth it.

Replying an old thread, but what do you mean here? I thought transactions were anonymous and new public keys could be generated to prevent tracking? I read today that Dash supposedly had private / confidential transactions - but I thought this was already a thing?
edit:  


I think I get it now...kinda...

What do you mean by this? If I have BTC in GDAX, I can transfer from this address to my Electrum address without a tx fee? I thought the tx fees were part of the bitcoin requirements, and only transfers between coinbase and GDAX were tx fee-free because of some kind of back-end voodoo?
In other words, to get BTC out of coinbase without tx fees, I can xfer to GDAX then xfer to another address?

Waiting sucks. Both times I've bought without locking in the price and both times the price rose in that period of time to more than what the fees would have been.
Of course it could have stayed where it was, or gone down.. Trying to dollar cost average is hard when it's a rocket ship.
