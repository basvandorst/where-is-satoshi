You said 10 Million / ETH =
10000000/200 = x**50000** ETH RATIO INCREASE
You said 150 Million / BTC =
150000000/8000 =  x**18750** BTC RATIO INCREASE
But **you still wait for BTC Drop.... And to buy BTC...**

@_date: 2019-07-26 12:38:12
I would like to recommand to buy 60% BTC, 15%ETH, 15% XRP... You should think about XRP/BTC and ETH/BTH never has been so low, then ratio will increase and you will probably be able to sell your ETH and XRP to get more BTC then if you buy them today. Then I dont recommand XRP and ETH for long time investissement but for the next month, you should be able to take more BTC by selling alt....  
  
in 10/2017 I bought 0.4 btc in altcoin and they became 1.7BTC at moment BTC Highest price ever.

It's normal. I looked 4hour candle 3 days ago and I sold 0.3 BTC (total 1.2). It will continue to go to 7-8k for 2 next month I think. Just study cycles, what happen seems normal. I do not think anymore about How Much $ I have but Only how many BTC now.

Print on Laser on Metal Your QR CODE PRIVATE KEY, create Multisig 2/3...  
Use ledger + engraved metal card copies + encrypted offline computer.   
Store the Ledger recovery passphrase on a family member, store the engraved metal QRCODE private key on other family member and in your own home, keep your ledger, and your encrypted computer... You can also copy the encrypted computer on encrypted Live-USBKEY you can give to an other member of you family : Mention on all you give to your family : KEEP IT SAFE FOREVER !!!!!!  
In this way, your wallet is not compromised at your home even if you have the 3key (only the metal card is not encrypted)
Your wallet is not compromised on your family member's home because all of them have only 1 key, or they have the 2nd Key encrypted with passphrase on Live-USBKEY copy
You can lose 1 key at your home and your wallet still accessible.   
You never never have 2 key displayed on same computer.... You always sign with an offline device.   
I think it's one of the safest way to do this.

Ok, unlikely has 2 translate in French. First is "low probability", the second is "no probability".  
Open source and decentralized mean that, while I have a version of Electrum on a computer, I can access ? Decentralized mean it can't be blocked from outside, it will always works Localy, then I can trust Multisig Wallet ?

The question is not it reach 1M... Reach 1M just mean Fiat are dead. Nobody will accept to sell his bitcoin even for 1 billion at this moment.
@_date: 2019-06-22 19:39:11
But I believe as a final convert of Fiat in cryptocurrency when the crisis will happen. Bitcoin is virtual Gold.   
This is New World Order plan... They will invest all the fiat false money themself. They will tell : "inflating currency destroyed the world, Bitcoin is deflating, it will never happen again". Countries will create other crypto, but all indexed on bitcoin reserve.

I remember a process for micro engraved information but can't find it... What I like in this solution is that it's protect against fire, protected from material hardware problem (water...), it's less obvious than big metal leaf engraved...  Not sure if it's micro engraved, maybe done with laser... Dont remember.   
That can also be a good solution just as a recover for 2/3 multisig wallet.

2000 billionaires = 10.000.000.000.000$...  
If you divide their wealth by coinmarketcap, you get 70... That mean, if fiat disappear and they convert their money to BTC, bitcoin will do x60... You can add the countries, the people... x100 is realistic, accorded to the fact that if they is hyperinflation before the fiat fall, it can do x1000 or x10000
