What are you talking about? Pirating software is a thing since there is software. In 1989 we cracked games for the C64 and used anonymous mailing addresses (PLKs in Germany) to send copies around. It was common then as it is today only slower.

You only need to subtract the fees you paid on your way and the taxes that may apply. 
@_date: 2016-08-15 14:33:12


How would you do that? It's not that there is a public leger for lost coins. Only if every user who lost coins would have announced it publicly there could possibly a track record.
@_date: 2016-08-20 16:08:46
By increasing the block size you would increase the throughput, yes. Scaling is increasing the throughput without increasing the block size (as achieved with SegWit). At some point in the future there will be a block size increase, this is when the internet as a whole scaled and ping times decreasing.
@_date: 2016-08-07 16:34:16
can you have a look here please?

Scaling-wise they do scale wisely.

From Wikipedia "Censorship is the suppression of free speech, public communication or other information which may be considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive or inconvenient as determined by governments, media outlets, authorities or other groups or institutions."
Luke is neither a government, media outlet, authority or a group. Therefore it can't be censorship. Also no one is forced to use it.

The equivalent to BC.I is storing your private key in a public dropbox folder and share the link on a Twitter account with no follower. There is still a possibility not to loose your money. 
No seriously, keep your keys with YOU by using a desktop wallet. 
I like Electrum and Multibit.

Erm, no!
@_date: 2016-08-06 05:20:27
No. As stated i'm talking about insurance and guaranties. A bank has such things but this is also possible to have as a exchange. You go to an insurance company and make a contract, that's it. The only thing that would change to the situation we have now is that the money of the user would be insured. 
@_date: 2016-08-28 11:47:15

@_date: 2016-08-19 15:18:19
First of all: The scenario is scaling bitcoin. Some people don't get scaling and making blocks bigger is _not_ the same thing. You need to think harder for scaling than just increase the size.
Every prediction about the future and how a fee market would evolve is based on BS not data. If we don't test it we will never find out!
@_date: 2016-08-07 08:18:41
If it was like that in Swiss law does not mean it apply to the rest of the world.
Also an inside MS marketing BS is not very representative for a whole market.

The wikipedia is not that clear on 'authority' than on 'censorship' but also describes it as a "power given by the State (in the form of government, judges, police officers, etc.)".
Luke has a say because he knows a lot, comes up with brilliant ideas and stands up for them but this only makes him one in a lot of people.
@_date: 2016-08-08 17:05:16

You send them coins and they directly send the other currency back to your own wallet. Therefore the time you need to trust them with your coins is minimised.

In short this means you always need to keep your bitcoins on your side. Don't trust a website with your coins.
In the banking system there are regulations in place so if the bank went bankrupt you will get your money back anyway. It's insured.
Bitcoin companies are not regulated or insured (mostly). When they loose your money or just run with it it's gone.
And this is exactly what happened. The website got the users funds stolen and now they are most likely dead in the water.

AntPool is by far not the most profitable pool there. Only because they are the biggest does not mean they are the best.
The fact they are the biggest is a sign for every miner to _not_ mine there. Your coins should grow in value, right? This becomes more likely with a decentralized mining world.

First of all there needs to be infrastructure (i.e local exchanges, a city driven 2P2 exchange solution).
There must be customer friendly regulation (i.e. insurance of funds sitting in an exchange, privacy-protecting rules).
There need to be education for the kids in school about basic economics and how bitcoin fits in.
There need to be cheap and renewable energy in the grid to enable citizens to mine. Subsidized power for people having solar cells on their roofs so they can mine cheap 24/7.

In your scenario this would take way much longer for BTC to adjust than 2 weeks.

How many people/institutions are likely to want bitcoin in the future and how many of them already have?
When bitcoin becomes mainstream, every insurance company, hedge fund, bank etc will have a huge demand.
So yes, starting now still makes you an early adopter.
@_date: 2018-01-25 06:03:48
Can you do the search again with excluding the word "cash".?

You can see what others have paid here. 20 sat/b would be one of the stripes below. Click on 20-25 on the left and you see exactly how many TXs will be mined ahead of yours.

You'll find a ton of stories just like that only by looking at the subreddit. As a reporter, you should know how to use the internet.

I once waited 16 days and the mempool was not at all that full like in the moment.
It will be confirmed when all TXs are mined that paid more sat/byte than you.

While i agree with your premise, i highly doubt the numbers.
Also, miners are spamming as well and for them, it is a zero-sum game. Spamming will go on as long as users are paying such high fees. And imho users are willing to pay high fees because using the bitcoin chain is superior to any other chain. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:32:30
Such a sad story. So sorry for your loss.

@_date: 2017-12-18 07:54:14
Erm, i'm not complaining about high fees man.
I'm pointing out that people are rather willing to pay high fees on the bitcoin chain instead of using  shitcoins. It shows, bitcoin users putting their money where their mouths are.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:43:59


Since it's 70 sat/b my best bet is it will go through some time this week. Don't quote me on this though.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:26:39
What's wrong with the source?
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:08:08
Thanks for your answer. :)
I get your point. But i think once seen, you can never unsee the B. I think this is a great analogy to bitcoin. ;)
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:52:22
I was making an argument pro bitcoin and anti shitcoin!
When people invest a lot of money in fees on the original chain (as we see to happen) there is a reason for that. The reason is that the trust value towards original chain is very high and users are willing to pay higher fees rather than using a shitcoin.

Well, this inflationary system brought our planet to a bad state. Incentives are to buy cheap, often, and soon. In a deflationary system, the incentives are reversed. This means resources can be used way more efficiently. The human footprint on earth will be lowered.

LOL, this is so not true...
The gold standard was abandoned because of a financial crisis that caused a hyperinflation. You are screwing up impact and cause here!

The whole subreddit is full of complaints about high fees. On the other hand, there are people willing to pay those fees. Don't you see some kind of mismatch here?
ATM people are paying [$61,902.34]( fees per block on the bitcoin chain. Why would they do this voluntary in your opinion?

Your prediction? What arguments would underly this?


Could you elaborate, please?  What instability? What causes it? And in which way would it cause resources being used inefficiently?


This is not at all how bitcoin works. Difficulty is not determined by usage, but by the networks hashrate.

Around half of all exchanges got hacked in the past. One can hope exchanges are getting better in protecting your money of course. I would not bet my money on it though.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:39:59
It is what you call it. People did call the recent price event a dip, so i guess it was one. :)
Seriously, trading is not science. It's not at all predictable nor is it well defined. When the price goes down and you call it dip people will know what you mean.
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:54:59
You got that right! :)
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:47:32
The mempool is where your transaction is sitting before it becomes included into a block (getting confirmed). Every bitcoin Core client running with open port 8333 (a node) is holding a mempool.

What are you talking about? ATM 92.31% of miner are mining BTC.
And this is after a recent difficult adjustment that made it way harder to find a block.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:51:38
Iff every node in the world has forgotten it, it can't be repropagated to the network and therefore will never take place. This is very unlikely since there are people running full nodes with high RAM. Only one node has to remember it and it will be repropagated to the network.

there is indeed a lower transaction cost for business and customers when using bitcoin in most cases. but still i don't think that it is that big of an advantage that it will rise the GDP of an whole country.
making the unbanked able to do transaction is an huge advantage. i think this could indeed rise the GDP of some countries.

a transaction produces data. data is measured in bytes. transactions are stored in blocks. the size of a block is limited to 1MB (1048576 bytes). if there are very much transactions a new block can't handle every transaction in the system anymore.
there are more bitcoin user every day the number of transactions taking place is ascending. so at some day in the future blocks become to small to store all transactions. this is why people now want to set the block size to 20MB instead of 1MB.
@_date: 2015-05-30 12:55:41

@_date: 2017-02-06 17:51:24
Buy bitcoin directly might be the better path to go unless you are a nerd and want to do it for educational sake (keep in mind that you will most likely make a loss on mining equipment).
If you buy bitcoin directly you might buy on monthly basis to lower the volatility risk.

mining machines can do just one thing: mining Bitcoins. what we see in your picture is not a mining operation. the NSA uses 'normal' computers/server to do their surveillance (everything else would make no sense). the NSA would need to build this data center a few times in SHA256 ASICs only to get to the 51% attack.
it's not impossible but very very unlikely (and extremely expensive) to do so. and if they did we would know.

For one for what i know the NSA provides the vast majority of exit nodes.
Snowden pointed out that the problem with Tor is that 'some' users can be tracked (i don't know the exact technical details). you never know if it's you. the smallest mistake you make leads them directly to you.
The main problem in my opinion is that using Tor makes you a default surveillance target.

i had the same thought. the one thing i don't understand at the moment is that the global hashpower is still very high. i would have expected that the big whales can't survive this and therefore the hashpower would decrease. perhaps there is way more burnable VC in the market then i've expected.
however it's a matter of time in my opinion until the price will go up or the global hashpower decreases.

I might be wrong, but then [Wikipedia]( is wrong too.
Assuming you are right and 10% of all coins on the supply chain are coming from newly mined coins you can at least expect a 10% gain in price. At current interest rates which are way below 10% you would make a netto gain.
@_date: 2017-03-29 14:27:09

ok, the 90% figure is clearly debatable. anyway, i bet the vast majority of nodes are run by people _not_ wanna validate payments but do it only in order to support the network.
let's assume i'm wrong, it's only like 30%. if 30% of hashrate is run by thousands of volunteer this could be an asset!

Hello and welcome to the bitcoin community Akeyla,
your short reading up must have been very efficient since you are well prepared!
As others mentioned a Trezor in combination with a Cryptosteel would also be my preferred way to store 10 BTC. It's worth it and leaves less room for screw ups (not that i think you can't handle it but we are all human and make mistakes).


Well, we are not seeing that well informed noobs here that often so no one here would actually do so. Feel free to come again with every question you have. :)
@_date: 2016-06-26 13:32:07

The halving actually is a great thing. It will ensure your coins are gaining purchasing power over time. The deflationary nature of bitcoin is intended and one of the awesome features bitcoin has.

@_date: 2016-06-01 13:12:42
Sorry to say but your statement is false!
I frequently send bitcoin without fee and it never was a problem for me. Most transactions are going through directly. Once i had to wait some hours to get it confirmed.
In this case i guess the transaction size is just to big. In my experience it's not the missing fee but the transaction size which causes miner to not include a transaction.

Well, then i must have dreamed it? In real i didn't send any coins because you said so?
@_date: 2016-06-05 15:20:22
Yes, that's what i mean. You need to trust them to give back your coins. If they screw up or get bankrupt or anything your coins are in danger.
In principle it's the same with banks but there is regulation in place protecting you against those losses (in many countries). This does NOT apply to bitcoin companies. So it's wise not to trust them too much.

Another variable in the game:
When a big portion of hashpower will switch to the altcoin the difficulty on the main chain will drop eventually. This drop will also make the mining on the main chain more profitable again after the readjustment.

The fee is due to supply (the network can handle only so many transactions) and demand (user are willing to pay for fast confirmation). If you attach a high fee it will get through pretty fast whereas it can take days when you pay a low fee.
Check this website to see what others pay &gt;&gt; 
A good wallet lets you define a satoshi per byte ratio.
The fees will eventually replace the block reward for miners to pay for the power bill.

Very close to zero? This chart shows exahashes. Do you know what 'exahashes' are?
When you see it close to zero on this chart, it is still a lot of petahashes mining on the chain. Calling this close to zero is still confirmation bias! Calling it zero is a blunt lie.

BTC miners are not mining at a loss these days. Have you seen the price recently? Because it's temporarily more profitable on an alt chain, not makes the main chain less profitable than before.

So, the difficulty dropped a little. Next retarget in a week looks like it's going up again. Some miner made an extra buck. Other chain is likely to die off when ASICBOOST miner are worn out. Price already goes down and i really don't see the shit recovering.

No, only a drop of price would. BCH might stay around for a while for traders to profit from it. Real users are not really needed to pump an altcoin. You can see it every day.
@_date: 2017-08-09 09:42:27
Yes. It would propagate blocks way faster in the network. I totally agree.

@_date: 2016-12-15 16:35:30
Yes, if you can save a few hundred milliseconds by not including the transactions and therefore have a faster propagation on the network this might give you and advantage.
I bet they did their research and stats to figure out when and how it's most efficient to do that.
Edit: Just thought perhaps the great firewall of China has something to do with it. Perhaps they are mining empty blocks when IT-latency is high.
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:49:10
Yes, it happens all the time in the bitcoin world. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:48:19
Well, a bank is insured against fraud, theft etc. Bitcoin exchanges aren't. So a bank is actually better!
@_date: 2017-08-27 08:22:11
Great you are willing to run a node. The more full node the better.
More nodes on the network will not solve the unconfirmed transaction problem though.
Let me explain a little. Your full node will receive, hold and transmit transactions throughout other nodes. The 'holding' part is also called the mempool. Taking transactions out of the mempool and putting them into a block is done by the miner. Your node then will receive, validate and store this new block with all its transactions in it.
Edit: Btw: mempool looks good today, you can check here &gt;&gt;

[1:53pm] gribble: The average time to generate a block at 300.0 Mhps, given difficulty of 3.17688400354e+11, is 144224 years, 42 weeks, 2 days, 17 hours, 16 minutes, and 52 seconds
And this would be a very very fast laptop.
Edit: OP asked about 1 BTC so it's only 11,537 years.

That's very interesting! What's once was a disadvantage now is an advantage.
@_date: 2016-12-15 14:45:27


An empty block must be faster to process and propagate, no?

I would love to hear your arguments against second layer technology.

Why the fuck would you sell it in the first place? What part of hodl don't you understand young man? Hope this one will lecture you to hodl next time. Now go to your room!
Sorry for the trouble man. You need to be honest though. You did nothing wrong and if your parents don't understand now, they will some day.

You can use it on the command line like a nerd or wait for wallets to implement it into the GUI. What would average Joe do?

@_date: 2016-12-15 14:51:12
It's better to get no fee but the block reward (12.5BTC) then loosing the block-race (who propagates the new block at first) to another miner.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:12:54
For what i know, the vast majority of miners exchange the coins directly to fiat in order to pay the power bills. Most don't speculate on prices.
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:07:39
How is mining an altcoin an attack on bitcoin? Would you explain, please?

@_date: 2018-06-24 05:37:07
Nope, with the current hashrate growth the next diff will go up like 20%

0.00018866 is $0,18. For 3 machines running.
For how long are they running now?
@_date: 2017-08-29 09:54:39
There is a lot of data recieved and send by a node. If you have a pruned (i.e. throttled) internet connection, you can't run a node. This is why people think (me included) blocks should be smaller, not bigger.
@_date: 2018-06-13 06:54:48
Thanks for your answer, Luke. 
@_date: 2016-12-12 15:16:21
For the next price event, you might use something with 2048 days in between. :P
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:45:23
Yes, depends very much on the fee at the moment. There is a shitton of unconfirmed transactions waiting and the only way to get your transaction confirmed in a reasonable time is paying more fee than the average.
Edit: Check this site to see what others pay &gt;&gt; 
@_date: 2017-08-28 13:02:10
You must be kidding! I'm not the one stating wrong facts! The hashpower of bcash was at no point at 0%!
So again, slowly for you to understand:
When the number shown is an average of 12h and you are looking at the last 3h the number can't be correct. You stated it as a fact anyway, this was what i was pointing out!

You know what's funny? You don't even know how my opinion is on this topic yet you are arguing ad hominem.
I don't assume anything at the moment. I only want to find out what's best now. And to be honest, you are not very helpful.

Looks more like BCH diff adjusting better now. no more huge spikes since then in POW (around 10-15%) &gt;&gt; 
Also, the BTC diff adjustment is only around 2% as it looks today &gt;&gt; 
You see, it's FUD

I respect that. Still, it's important to talk with key player about this. The people need information.
Thank you anyway! :)
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:24:56
Because no one wants centralization meaning is opposing bigger blocks atm. SegWit was what we needed and the mempool is proving it.

May i ask how this vulnerability would look like?

No, if you vote for XT you vote for a package of things, not only the block size.

A good definition makes discussions way more productive. :)
@_date: 2015-08-30 13:06:08
You are absolutely right, and this thread is a good example how the opposite opinion is getting downvoted to the ground just for having another opinion. Either there are a bunch of (anti XT) shill accounts downvoting or theymos' marketing (i find it hard to use the word censorship) has borne fruit. The later i find rather unlikely.
EDIT: hahaha, the opposite opinions i mentioned above are now deleted! This all has gone far beyond ridiculous.

@_date: 2015-08-30 17:55:03
Thank you very much for you answer.
And i totally agree, we should all work together. Sadly this is no more the case. Me personally don't blame Blockstream for that. But i can understand that people are suspicious. They see an obvious conflict of interest when all the employees of one firm that kinda profits from a small block size collectively argue for a small block size.
I think it's great that this podcast was done and many others with fellow colleges of yours should follow.
@_date: 2015-08-07 16:12:44
See? Public!
This is really not what you want to implement if you actually want people vote.
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:00:01
You are falling for the big block propaganda. Sorry to hear that. Let me tell you how i see it:
Bitcoin has proven to be resilient. This is not the first and will not be the last attack on bitcoin. All the alleged negative news ricochet when i see what creative and mindful developer come up with. I laugh about the 100th "bitcoin is dead" article i read because i see a great community scaring off big money and govs. I'm watching this now for a long time, and if i learned one thing than it is not to belive in what random people/media says but trust the math, the game theory and the network effect coming with it.
@_date: 2015-08-27 18:40:16
Thank you for your great answer. I think it's pretty accurate.
Still i don't get the correlation to the story told. Would it have been less harmful if the post where deleted while he was awake? How could the scammer know he was asleep?
Or perhaps this doesn't matter at all which i was about to suggest in the first place.
@_date: 2015-08-30 08:57:57

@_date: 2015-08-19 18:52:59
Yeah, why it is not? I always wondered why this whole XT thingy is so fishy to me and now it strikes me that the block size increase in XT might only be a trojan horse.
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:52:25
In this case, i do recommend Electrum. :)
@_date: 2017-11-01 05:44:45
Would you agree, that if a user has only 8 connections open, giving them the advice to open port 8333 is correct?
@_date: 2019-02-13 13:19:48
Also, blocks propagate faster meaning less orphan blocks, making the network more secure.
@_date: 2017-11-01 05:31:49
How many connections does a non-validating wallet open?
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:17:38

From the bitcoin-dev mailing list (dosen't sound that proven to me):


should encourage making it worse.
Centralization of mining has been a continual gripe since Slush first
invented pooled mining. There has never been a time after that when people
weren't talking about the centralisation of mining, and back then blocks
were ~10kb.
I see constant assertions that node count, mining centralisation,
developers not using Bitcoin Core in their own businesses etc is all to do
with block sizes. But nobody has shown that. Nobody has even laid the
groundwork for that. Verifying blocks takes milliseconds and downloading
them takes seconds everywhere except, apparently, China: this resource
usage is trivial.
Yet developers, miners and users even outside of China routinely delegate
validation to others. Often for quite understandable technical reasons that
have nothing to do with block sizes.

Again, this is not my argument, i only said that i can *understand* the argument. In a world where you theoretically can send as much transactions as you want (a world with very, very big blocks) there is no need for payment channels etc.


As far as i aware of, bigger blocks mean less decentralisation is rather marginally. And it's an assumption, not a proven fact.


We'll all profit from a healthful debate without censorship!

Wait for dip? That's cute. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:44:09
There is no timeout. There is the theoretical possibility that all the nodes forget it when they run out of memory. But if there is only one node with a very big memory it can easily propagate the lost TXs back to the network.

In order to produce your car there was like 30-50 tons of CO2 needed. To warm up your house you massively burn fossil energy sources.
But here we stand debating the footprint of bitcoin?
Have you ever calculated how much a transactions footprint actually is? Is it grams or micrograms of CO2?
And have you ever compared this to the 'normal' money supply? How many tons of CO2 does your bank need to heat the house in winter? How many banks are there doing the same?

Erm, no!
Mining reward per block is the same. When the hashrate goes down, this means there where fewer blocks found. This means BTC miners have been getting less money due to fewer blocks found over the last couple of weeks.
Perhaps there are more blocks this difficult period but we can't say right now. If bitmain/btc.com keep mining shitcoins, then probably not.

Look at the pic. There are TXs over 2000 sat/b accumulating to 0.1. Then there are TXs with over 1000 sat/b. Adding 0.05 accumulating to 0.105. Then the over 800 sat/b TXs (another 0.005) now accumulating to 0.110 and so on.
@_date: 2018-11-15 17:34:18
I don't think you really understand what Target2 actually is. It's not debt. And we (German here) don't finance them through this. It's a payment system between national central banks.
There are redistribution effects due to EU law but this has nothing to do with Targer2. Also, of the top of my head, i don't think Italy even is a profiteer of this EU system. Their economy is huge.

Why not, young padawan.
Imagine you are company X in Germany and are a customer of the A bank. I am company Y in Italy. My bank is the B bank.
Now, you buy products from me for 1mio euro. You send 1 mio via your bank A to my bank B. Your money is gone from your account, my account is now worth more by 1mio. So far so obvious.
What is happening in the background? Is bank A sending money to bank B? Actually, this is not the case. Bank A would tell the German central bank to do the over the border transaction. Bank A will have a debt towards the German central bank whereas the bank B in Italy has a credit towards the Italian central bank. And since this isn't the only transaction the central bank's exchange, they have a spreadsheet of transactions and only balance it if there is a need to.
Now, imagine Germany is buying more products from Italy than vice versa. In this case Target2 would have a unbalances sheet which could grow. But you need to understand, everyone on the seller's side has their money. Anyone on the debtor side has paid their debt.

So how about calling it "node software" then?
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:34:09
OK, i'll try ELI5 as well. Double spending is indeed a problem, but it is very very expensive to maintain for a long time. Eventually, people will notice and dismiss the fraudulent chain. Payments during that time that thought to be transferred will be in the sender's wallet again. A huge chaos as you can imagine.
The other risk is a so-called selfish mining attack. Simply put it's finding a block but not telling the others about it and wait for another block you can mine on top of it. When someone other now publishes a block but you have 2 or even 3 blocks found you never told anyone about, you can now publish them all in a row. All the other miner in the network will now try to find a block to put on top of your block because it has the longer chain (this is a network rule to do so). So where are we now? The miner was cheated out of their block, the whole network mined on top of it for a while because they didn't know about your blocks and therefore lost energy. Everyone is cheated except you.

Today we have an inflationary system. Markets produce for the desire not for the needs of the people. Why is that so? Because your money loses buying power over time. Your incentive is to buy now and cheap.
In a deflationary world, incentives are to hoard money. It will gain purchasing power over time. You'll only buy things when you really need them and you'll buy a good quality product since you want it to last very long.
Resources are wasted today. The system we have brought us climate change. It is necessary to reduce the human footprint on this planet. I really think bitcoin is good for the environment long term.
Now, how about the economy. We are told in capitalism we need growth forever. This is bullshit IMHO. It's a theory, but it's never proven!

At this point the difficulty is etimated to rise about 4%. So only 4% more hashing power went into the chain than the period before. So no, a higher block rate does not explain an completely empty mempool for me.

Generally speaking, you want many pools with a low hashrates instead of a few pools with high hashrates. When there are pools controlling to much hashpower there are risks involved for the whole network. Like for example cheating on other miners, or even users.

When there are fees in a block you don't collect for ideological or malicious reasons, this is not a good thing even though it's possible or allowed by the protocol. Also, i don't see how this is an example for a fee market since it is economically reasonable to collect the low fees as well.

TIL the payout mechanism is a huge point for Chinese miners. They want a steady income.
For average "when do i ROI" miner who is only interested in profit would choose the mining pool with the highest net profit.

The price could fall to 200 bucks and the hashrate would not decline in the same proportion. There is paid mining gear out there producing hashes with water power for no cost at all. Those would be hashing anyway.
Also, most miners who have to pay a power bill at the end of the month would just mine at a loss anyway since they are invested in order to sell BTC when the price is higher again.
@_date: 2018-02-16 07:28:52
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:33:49
But are the margins between the cost of mining and BTC price big enough to afford volatility in income? I mean, decentralisation is a driver for the bitcoin price as well and therefore should be in every miner's interest.
And since i have you on the line allow me more questions, please.
In your opinion, how diverse is the Chinese mining landscape?
Is the payment model/steady income the number one driving aspect for Chinese miners to use PPS+ pools?

They act as a bank without insurance. They go, your money is gone too.

No, they don't!


not in the foreseeable future.


You can use existing channels.


You are implying, there is a puppet master pulling strings, but this is not BCH dictatorcoin but truly open source. The ecosystem is more like a puzzle coming together with random pieces. Like some developer has a great idea (like segwit) and we are a step further. It will grow organically.

A few month ago we thought 1 MB is 1 MB. With SW we learned 1 MB might be up to 1.7 MB. I can imagine more improvements in this way.

Websites are no wallets. They are services with no guarantee you'll get your coins back. In fact, it is pretty common that people are losing money because they thought websites are safe; they are not.
For your computer i recommend [Electrum](

No need to be sorry.
I assume by mining station you mean a mining farm. And yes, there is a lot of heat involved. Computer chips tend to get hot. see here &gt;&gt; 
They are calculating SHA256 block hashes. When they find a valid block they put it on top of the recent block of transactions. This blockchain is what is 150GB big. It's getting bigger with every block found.

In the stats you can see it's a very continuous rise in these TXs. This must be one entity running a bot, this is not natual random people doing this.
I suspect an exchange is moving user accounts to segwit addresses.

@_date: 2018-02-12 17:21:02
I'm not ignorant but ideologic and logic.
When i think bitcoin is superior, of course i don't mine bch even if i earn a few less bucks. The mining profitability of BCH is sometimes slightly higher, i give you that. Would i support a dictatorcoin? Hell no! Would i support bitcoin mining centralisation? Also no, because it would potentially lower the bitcoin price and therefore my income.
@_date: 2018-07-15 07:35:35
Well, i guess the lower TX count on the weekend leaves free space in blocks.

Those transactions will hit blocks eventually and if we see a nice bump of SegWit TXs in the stats we know we where right.
Also, it looks like it stopped 15 minutes ago.

That would be a "indirectly" hint which is forbidden.
@_date: 2018-11-14 18:11:11
Thought experiment: It can't go to zero because you would break the math of trading platforms. So a good developer would hard code a 0,01 limit, right? so logically the correct answer would be 0,01.

Obama promised to change this behavior. This is what he was elected to do. But he didn't changed anything at all.

Yes, there are ways to hack people. But bitcoin isn't hacked by now although the incentive is pretty high.

Do you think cars are a bad idea and we don't need them because we should think about all those saddlers who are now unemployed?
Saying we can't go forward, we need to have inefficiencies for people to stay employed is kicking the rest of the economy in the ass.
Getting rid of inefficiencies is one great thing bitcoin provides and in the long run this is good for the economy even though some people might need to get another job.

it depends not only on the available coins but more on the demand. the demand is not correlated with the supply.
what if in 2016 the costs to produce BTC are way lower (let's say half costs) then today (one could think so/in fact there is evidence for this trend)?

It's not really a refund. You need to wait until the network 'forgets' your TX. This happens iirc when the node you relied your TX to is getting rebooted. Anyway it might take some days or weeks perhaps.
Really wishing good luck.

Not really sure if i understand your question.
The bitcoin blockchain is a public record of all transactions confirmed by the network. They are timestamped so your time machine like thingy only needs to read the public leger.
The mempool holds the transactions that hit the network and are not yet confirmed.
What other data do you want to collect exactly?

You can only reduce your risk of getting exposed. Actually if you do anything right (use a brand new computer bought with cash in a store no one would remember you and there is no CCTV / don't use at home / never do anything else on it / etc) you are pretty safe but not 100%.

There are 5 entities involved in bitcoin:
* Bitcoin user
* Trading platforms
* People running nodes
* Core developer
* Miner
None of these entities could change the protocol on it's own. There need to be a consensus between parties to make changes possible.

If your internet connection is flaky a high speed node wouldn't help you anyway.
On the other side if you are a user interested in short syncing times you might be better off with a SPV wallet for your transaction. If you run a node to support the network it does not matter how long it takes to sync.

That the miner did not include more transactions into the block. Reasons for that may be there aren't any more TXs in the mempool (which is very unlikely) or they hope to get their smaller block to get relayed by the network faster.

I would not say it's misinformed but you are right, it's indeed not the whole picture. Mike had a lot of room. Of course it would have been better to ask some other developer as well.
I mainly recommended the podcast because of the interview with Bobby Lee. I think it's clear they'll stick with core because they don't like some random developer telling them what to do and they do trust the Core developer team with this important issue.

@_date: 2016-07-22 06:12:03
This is not for privacy reason, but you should never use a web wallet. Only the one holding the private key is holding the ability of spending the coins. If the web service closes your coins are gone. They can also easily steal your money.
There are like 100 methods to reduce your risk of exposure. 
Most effective might be to buy a cheap laptop with cash, unmount hardware you don't need from it (like Bluetooth), install Linux or BSD, never use your home wifi with it, never do anything else with it.
This will not prevent everyone from seeing your transactions, but it will be harder to track it back to you.
