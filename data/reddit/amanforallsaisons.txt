Why don't you fuck off to some Nordic homogenous utopia then?

Please point to some specific provisions of Japanese immigration law restrictions based on nationality/race/culture, or admit you got nothing.

Maybe if you crawed down out of Farage's ass you'd be a bit more aware of the world.

It was a bit weird to see British Asians and Black British talking about how they voted to leave the EU because of immigration...

Fuck off with your concern trolling. My city is awesome, it's safe, and its diversity is one of its great strengths. I feel bad for your ignorance and hate.

The UK doesn't want your racist policies, so by your own logic you should move. It's not my fault that there aren't any good white ethno-states for you to choose from. Maybe that's because it's a shitty ideology.

Ok, dear.

"I'm also a xenophobe" doesn't cancel out "I'm a racist."

List for me please the Asian or African nations that have ethnicity-based immigration laws, and the details of those laws that you feel would be good to have in the UK. It's ok, I'll wait.

Their comment history is full of racist &amp; other bigoted drivel.

I live in a city that has 21% Muslims. That doesn't make me an expert on Islam any more than it does you. Your experiences are not monolithic or representative.

Spending $40 is a pain in the ass in many large businesses.
@_date: 2018-09-24 11:04:50
That's not what you want though, is it? You want the freedom to exclude others from your country based on their race/culture/religion. If you can't see how that's racist, I'm not going to have any success explaining it to you.
@_date: 2018-09-24 10:52:58
Yeah, you're just an ethno-separatist. Diet Nazi.

Excellent (from a layman's perspective) take on things, especially since you seem to have followed Hanlon's Razor throughout.
One question to Cameron or anyone else. If the bitcoins are truly "gone," would that then be equivalent to (assuming for a moment that the USD had a market cap), Bill Gates burning his fortune? IE: the total number of bitcoins would be permanently reduced, therefore according to the quantity theory of money, increasing the value (Market Cap/Number of "legitimate" bitcoins) of each individual "real" bitcoin?

Except he's clearly not Satoshi, and she effectively doxxed an innocent old man. "oh jeez" "how long will this media hoopla last?" both quotes from much better researched articles. 
Plus, I don't know what world you live in, but if an old man feels he has to call the cops to get you to go away, you've violated a huge non-aggression principle.

Then she better cough up badge numbers, and a valid reason why they were so interested.

Keep in mind Christianity didn't exist as such then. 
Though the ongoing Catholic prohibition against usury by Christians, coupled with restrictions on the jobs Jews in Europe could hold, ended up driving quite a few Jewish families into finance. Of course that would be repaid with the paranoid canard that Jews control banking, because why not.

As a lurker both here and in the Bitcoin world, even I know that the "hacks" of Bitcoin weren't of the actual tech.... it's all been either inside jobs or hacks of the security of various websites, people, etc.  
It's like saying "Having a credit card is stupid because someone can hack Target."  It says nothing about the stability of the underlying protocols.

Out of curiosity are you getting any guidance from your bar association re: bitcoin in general, not just for retainers? I imagine it will start to become an issue in probate soon.
