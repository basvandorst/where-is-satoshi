Blocking everybody who has an opposing opinion is not preventing brigading its CENSORSHIP. Something you should know a lot about.     
Perhaps you don't even notice becasue you are still on the inside of the circle? The groupthink of core has bullied all opposing opinion out of the circle, to the point their locus is now so far removed from that of the rest of the ecosystem, that users and adoption no longer matter.

The Core development team that you so vehemently support has shown zero effort to compromise. To the point it will probably end up with a persistent fork in the ledger. What will it take to 'convince' you or them that some compromise is necessary for the good of everyone? 
@_date: 2016-08-14 17:21:24
You do realise Unlimited only exists as a direct result of Cores unwillingness to compromise right? The whole point of this stupid thread. Keep bikeshedding.

On chain and off chain scaling. 100,000 TPS. The On chain scaling is vital, currently there are 1000's of App developers having to put projects on hold until they know how the protocol will accommodate new transactions over 3TPS.

Coinbase stands to profit more from a restricted network, as they will become a lightning hub. Therefore their agenda is honest.    
    


    
Maybe this is the case? But until we have pushed mainchain scaling we'll never know. Satoshi believed it could work. I want to see.        


  
look out the window. The network is already centralised so this argument is redundant. Keeping block size small and pushing transactions offchain just opens up another attack vector to tax transactions. and reduce security. possibly even fractionally reserve bitcoins.    


I was talking about how Segwit changes the incentives for data by prioritising the witness data. (financially forcing its use) plus forcing all wallets and services to change their code. That's technical debt and bad for design.


This is simply wrong, as it fails to understand the economic principles of supply and demand with a quota in a free market. Any artificial limit on the block space commodity will drive use elsewhere. Simple fact. Its the seats on the bus analogy when there is a myriad of other transport available.     
    


Perhaps you don't see the insidious nature of soft forks and how dishonest they are? They alter the protocol by feature creep. Was there consensus for RBF? Rules and economic incentives are being changed with every update.     
Ps the majority can do what they want its a protocol governed my majority rule. 51% sets the rules. The game theory that runs the protocol means the Majority will do what's best for the network. (that doesn't involve stealing coins or inflation) Currently we have minority rule of CoreBS dev team who are now being handled by R3 (banking consortium) and PwC, against the good of the network.

You are randomly selecting 'worst case scenarios' to fit with your agenda of diverting main chain scaling to off chain.  There are plenty to choose from.     
    
How about the worlds financial system is on the verge of collapse in a worthless pile of debt, we need room ASAP onboard as many users as possible yesterday.       
   
There have been safe scaling options available for years, not some dangled carrot in 'two weeks' time that has been used to stall everything for months. Many folks here are suffering from hypothesis myopia.

Simply that there are many demons that can be used for fear in order to push certain agendas. 
    


That's more like a mean estimate than maximum. Cornell study said 90% of nodes would be functional at 4MB (so hardly a maximum). Also many improvements are already available to increase the limiting factors from within their study.     
    
Don't get me wrong I'm all for trying the innovations of Lightning SegWit and these fancy Schnorr sigs. (But I don't want to be forced to use them due to fancy data accounting tricks). There is NO reason for anyone to be against increasing the blocksize other than conflict of interest at this point... So why hasn't it been done? Everyone is sick of this. Stubborn Ego has got in the way of progress.

As far as I understand?? it works on a per transaction basis. So unless you upgrade and configure your node/wallets to send SW transactions the 'extra' space will not be gained. I'd predict it will be at least several years before we see the touted 4x capacity increase if ever. Somebody more knowledgeable should really chime in here, this is very new ground.

I think you'd be pleasantly surprised how quickly any fork would resolve itself. Incentives to cooperate are huge.

Think you misunderstand how SW 'scales' bitcoin. SW transactions will likely be soft forked and therefore opt in. Only when 100% of the transactions are of this style do we see the all of the boasted capacity increases. Multisig could be considered an equivalent beneficial parallel. How longs that been out? How many typical daily transactions are multisig? 
@_date: 2015-12-28 12:39:37
Yet to be convinced LN fits this category. It is afterall structurally removing many transactions and fees away from the mining incentive. This could be considered an attack on miners. Jury is still out.

Miners themselves can limit uneconomical transactions. By the very definition they are uneconomical. Even with your wildly miscalculated costs, you are on the right path. There is 'A cost' to include a transaction. Each miner needs to do their own cost analysis and set minimum relay fee and max blocksize. The supply and demand on the network will do the rest.

You conveniently neglect the very principle that makes bitcoin function. In any scenario with two diametrically opposed implementations, 51% is sufficient to create a hardfork. This is the point where the foundational game theory takes over. A resolution of this consensus failure would quickly occur as users exchanges and nodes rapidly jump onto the chain with the most work, cascading to align with the economic majority.
@_date: 2015-12-16 21:29:29
There is no Spoon.    
A fee market already exists. There is currently 0.5btc sitting in the mempool now, awaiting collection. Most consumer wallets default to a minimum relay fee, as they should. A rational consumer is willing to pay a small fee to make sure their transaction is included with priority. Miners will eventually have their own spam filters and refuse to relay transactions they see an unprofitable. This is how a fee market develops - independent to an irrelevant blocksize limit.

Missing the point. This is about fear and control. The false dichotomy of settlement and payment is being used as a dividing line upon which to control the entire ecosystem. Core developers have used a bogeyman fear of decentralisation to dictate how the network should be used. This IS a single point of failure and totally hypocritical to their thesis.

I see you're till insisting that a 75% consensus makes something an altcoin? Despite the the crazy flaw in this logic, where if we had 90% demanding change it only takes 11% of stubborn ideologues to block any changes. Consensus in bitcoin is 51%, you will have to deal with this at one point.

In principle i'd agree with this, but please define 'consensus rules' Can someone give me a nice list of what these rules are?     
Eg: If I found a way to increase the block reward (or blocksize) through a soft fork would that be a break in consensus rules? To me consensus rules are the original economics and social contract set in motion at the genesis block.    
 Introducing a fee market breaks this contract, removing 0conf breaks this contract. All being done without consensus on the rules.

Currently through FUD. Namely fear of the demon decentralization. We are seeing large mining pools all saying BIP101 is too aggressive. Yet between them they control 90% of the network. FFS they just have to put in a soft limit where ever they want it, then ring their buddies up to do the same- now 90% of the new blocks will be limited to a size they control. End of problem. Block size limit is a red herring set in motion by those who wish to force transactions off chain and thereby devaluing it.

I'd say its all in the name of 'Regulation'. I don't think its anything really sinister, but it pissed me off when they locked deposits and withdrawals to my account AFTER I had sent a deposit. it took several weeks just to find out why I was suddenly unverified, then several more weeks to get the additional paperwork cleared with them.

 All I wanted to do was setup a new transfer to bitstamp that my online bank account could not handle, due to my poor mobile phone reception failing to receive the security code in time.
I hung up in a fit of frustration as the person was about to transfer me for the 15th time and nearly threw my laptop across the room.    
 The sooner I can close my bank account and live 100% bitcoin the better good riddance to them.

    Update the Namecoin code (currently based on Bitcoin 0.3.x)
    Improve scalability (Resolve domains without need of download and processing blockchain)
    Automatic renewal of domains
    Cold-storage (porting armory)
    Optimize speed (Although now Dot-it is much faster than other top-level domains)
    Better blockchain anonymity (e.g. implementing Zerocoin)
    Blockchain privacy (using encryption for obscure domain-owners data)
    Improve better implementation of NameID; decentralized single sing-on system based on Namecoin.

Lisa is known for having a huge heart, a wealth of experience, and a history of getting things done. Lisa has worked with people to create things (housing, organizations, businesses, newspapers, gardens) which enable people to thrive. She has collaborated with politicians, contractors, neighbours, people on the street, community associations and more to bring about positive change in the community. Councillor Helps is known for being generous, patient, firm, and focused. Lisa learns best by doing, and in conversation with people. She is thrilled to be at the Victoria City Council table and will bring her heart, experience and big-picture, long-term thinking (as a trained historian) to bear on all decisions.
Lisa's leadership principles and values:
    Have clarity of vision
    Meet people where they are at
    Pay more attention to what is than "what if?"
    Ensure that the scale of energy invested is reflected in the scale of the effect
    Bring a diversity of interests, agendas and ideologies into a singularity of focus; turn that focus into action
In addition to being a City Councillor, Lisa is the Executive Director of Community Micro Lending - an organization that she helped to start in 2009. Community Micro Lending makes small loans and provides mentorship and support to local people who want to start businesses or become self-employed but don't qualify for credit from banks.

The Economist:
Bitcoin’s future
Hidden flipside
How the crypto-currency could become the internet of money
Mar 15th 2014 | From the print edition
Bitcoin: the original
THE father has been found in time for his child’s funeral. That would appear to be the sorry state of affairs in the land of Bitcoin, a crypto-currency, if recent press coverage is to be believed. On March 6th Newsweek reported that it had tracked down Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s elusive creator. And on March 11th Mt Gox, the Japanese online exchange that had long dominated the trade in the currency before losing $490m of customers’ Bitcoins at today’s prices, once more filed for bankruptcy protection, this time in America.
In reality, things are rather different. Evidence is mounting that Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, whom Newsweek identified as Bitcoin’s father, is not the relevant Satoshi. More importantly, Bitcoin’s best days may still be ahead of it—if not as a fully fledged currency (see article), then as a platform for financial innovation. Much as the internet is a foundation for digital services, the technology behind Bitcoin could support a revolution in the way people own and pay for things. Geeks of all sorts are getting excited—including a growing number of venture capitalists, who know a new platform when they see one.
In this section
To understand the enthusiasm in this modern currency, it helps to think about a very old one. Until the early 20th century the people on Yap, an island in the Pacific Ocean, used large stone disks (pictured) as money for big expenses, such as a daughter’s dowry. Being very heavy, they were rarely moved when spent. Instead, they simply changed owners. Every transaction became part of an oral history of ownership, which allowed islanders to know the proprietor of each stone and made it difficult to spend the same stone twice.
Bitcoins also don’t move around when they are transferred. They are best understood as entries in a giant ledger, the “blockchain”, which contains the transaction history for every Bitcoin in circulation. It is kept up to date with the help of cryptography and copious computing power, provided by a global network of tens of thousands of computers. Again, openness helps the system remain secure: the blockchain is public so every participant can check whether a transfer comes from the rightful owner.
This set-up is the first workable solution to one of the more nagging problems of the digital realm: how to transfer something of value from one person to another without middlemen having to make sure that the item is not copied or, in the case of money, spent more than once? And Bitcoin does the trick while being open (unlike conventional payment mechanisms, which aim for security by shielding themselves from outsiders). This means that third parties can make use of Bitcoin’s features without having to ask anyone for permission—as is the case with the internet.
Such “permissionless innovation”, in the jargon, should in time result in a cornucopia of applications. Bitcoin’s technology could be used to transfer ownership both in other currencies and of any kind of financial asset. This, in turn, would allow the creation of decentralised exchanges which let asset holders trade directly. And money could be “programmed” to come with conditions: for instance, it might be released only if a third person agrees.
Some want ownership of devices—a car, say—to be represented by a Bitcoin, or a tiny fraction of it. The car would work only when turned on with a key that includes the Bitcoin token. This would make managing ownership of and access to physical assets much easier: the token could be sold or rented out temporarily, enabling flexible peer-to-peer car-rental schemes. Such “smart property” would turn the blockchain into a global registry of ownership in physical assets.
All that may sound like science fiction, but a growing number of startups are working on bringing such applications to market. Coloured Coins and Mastercoin will soon release software that enables trade in other financial assets, including stocks and bonds. The most ambitious project is Ethereum: it will launch a new blockchain, similar but unrelated to Bitcoin, with a programming language to encode financial instruments and other contracts.
Although banks have mostly steered clear of Bitcoin as a currency, they too have started exploring how they could use the technology in other ways. They are unlikely to move fast, but there are plenty of possibilities. Global banks could, for instance, use Bitcoin-like systems to move money between subsidiaries. They could even issue their own crypto-currencies.
But turning Bitcoin into a platform comes with risks. Some geeks fret that the network will reach its maximum capacity of 300,000 transactions per day as new applications come online. Another worry is that as the blockchain, which has already trebled in size to 15 gigabytes over the past year (see chart), continues to grow, fewer of the network’s participants will store it.
Yet if history is any guide, the blockchain will be fine. Two decades ago, when millions went online after the invention of the web browser, pundits predicted the internet’s collapse. Technical fixes repeatedly saved the day. And even if Bitcoin were to break down, another similar system would most likely take its place.

Gads no. its not a difficult thing to do.
Just click on **tools** then select **Reset Blockchain and Transactions** this will then bring up the 'reset' tab, click the button and re-sync you wallet. *takes a few moments to run*
edit: As general good practice you should however, always keep several copies of your wallet check the multibit website

'contentious hardfork' This term bugs me. The only reason it's contentions is that core have not added it to their codebase. I honestly believe that if they promptly added the same code as claxxic all of this drama would be over and the rifts would heal,  probably along with a huge price spike.    
As for keeping an open mind I think you'd be surprised how many from 'the other place' also want things like LN Sidechains and SW.     
The problem is that the blockspace issue has forced alot of Bitcoin use cases to examine other options. Just look at storj they are considering leaving, and I can't imagine Openbazzar sticking around if transactions start getting stuck.  In short there has to be breathing space.
@_date: 2016-03-08 00:33:32


True true. There has been an uneasy truce since the early days. Two different visions two different paths. However as a fairly independent observer, I see nothing but compromise on one side and a hard line on the other, this makes for frustration. (compounded by stupid censorship) Surely a low minimum transaction fee and an adaptive blocksize would keep all parties on amicable terms. From my vantage point, it's just basic conflict resolution.

I'm not saying it's a good thing, it's just inevitable, as the cost increases to include a transaction into the blockchain. Euros and dollars is a misleading analogy, its more like western union or transferwise.

@_date: 2016-03-07 14:11:32


The blockchain is the settlement mechanism. The only distinction between settlement and payment in this argument is the cost of transaction wrt the blockspace available. These pressures exist without a blockspace quota.

tricksy tricksy. its not a linear issue it's exponential. If the block size limit is 1MB and there are say 0.9MB of legitimate transactions, the attacker only needs to pay for &gt;0.1MB to cause problems.
If the block size limit is 2MB and there are 0.9MB of legitimate transactions, the attacker needs to pay for &gt;1.1MB of legitimate transactions, costing 11x as much.

Commendable effort at bridging the gap, but I think you're being somewhat naive here. This is clearly a manipulated debate, with some seriously hidden agendas and conflicts of interest. It's what has not been said and the implicit associations from lack of action that mark many members of this community as guilty.      
 
Code already exists that nodes could run to ignore the blocksize. Let users configure their own requirements and simply follow the longest chain. This is an issue that should clearly be settled by the free market, not some clique of self appointed experts. The free market knows everything, let it out the box.

It's justified through the ability to scale. Not everybody needs to run a full node. The biggest issue here is can people freely transact on the mainchain. When a blocksize quote makes this prohibitably expensive, who cares if you have a full node it will be of no use. There is a balance between everyone being able to run a full node and every transaction being put on the blockchain. The answer to finding the sweet spot is to let both forces play out in a free market environment.

The merchant is using his own example; your personal conditions differ. So I don't think anyone is attempting to understate the dangers. A merchant like the example, can easily afford to take this risk (perhaps even mitigate it, by accepting transactions from only well known wallets?)    
 My point is RBF is heading in the wrong direction, why make it easier to double spend just becasue its possible? There are ulterior motives here that are not logical. Weak blocks and subchains seem like the right direction.

From an app developers point of view the game doesn't need to make a profit it just has to become popular. From an an initial investment of 1 or 10 BTC as a total of in game currency, these hundreds of millions of satoshis are slowly rewarded to gamers. (small enough to be valuable but not enough to be a tax or gambling risk.) I imagine kids playing for a month or so and getting a few bucks out at the end. Level up to cash out at certain price points.     
once it becomes popular enough start charging 50c a download and put half of that back into the game currency.

This is absolutist thinking. Why trust 1 confirmation and not 0 confirmations? The only real difference is the statistical probability of a double spend. Therefore if you can have fractional blocks (like weak blocks, Xtreme thinblocks or subchains) You have a refined system with increased granularity, so it's proportionally less likely to have a double spend as time passes.    
    
 0 Confirmations are still bitcoin, you argument is like saying 1mm is not the metric system but 1cm is.

If I'm doing 10 000 weekly transactions to sell my 'eg' digital comic at 10c an issue and it costs 7c to do a transaction I'm suddenly am very interested in conducting this in an 'altcoin' including the exchange rate risk. All of my business has now been driven off the bitcoin blockchain and onto 'altcoin'. Now what if there are 10,000 companies like mine? That's transaction fees being forced away from the bitcoin industry and given away to the litecoin miners. I really don't get what's so hard to understand?

Nakamoto consensus will fix this issue. The economic incentives to cooperate are being severely underestimated in this debate.    
 Say The code fork to classic goes ahead, this leaves Core with a decision. Allow 2MB, and carry on the main chain as normal, or belligerently hold to their ideals and attempt to permanently fork the blockchain.    
In scenario 2 the longest chain wins, as it has majority hash power, the shortest chain dies a very quick death as everyone fears to loose their money and abandons it. (those who are the most stubborn loose the most in this scenario)

Unfortunately more work needs to be done here. The whole distinction between soft and hard forks has become very blurry. Fact is you can soft fork pretty much any change. So by not upgrading in a soft fork, all that's really happened, is you've lost control. 
@_date: 2016-06-18 18:31:35
There is absolutely zero evidence that an immediate bump to &lt;4MB would have one iota of effect on decentralization.    
 In fact the opposite is true. Right now with every cent increase in average transaction fees, Users and Use cases are being forced to find other solutions.     
This is putting a massive resistance on the growth and network effect fuelling adoption. More users or use cases =  greater decentralization.    
 Furthermore with sufficient users it will become politically difficult to legally shut the network down. Waiting for as yet untested complex software to 'Save us' is cutting your nose off to spite your face, when a simple block size increase will remove all this unnecessary tension. 
@_date: 2016-06-18 14:06:03
This is my point, Eth should? survive this, unlikely the DAO will. Now imagine you have an error in the 'base level' code of segwit? That could Kill Bitcoin. It's beyond comprehension and apparently defies simple explanation as to why we are not doing the simple scaling bump option first. 
@_date: 2016-06-18 12:11:10
The lesson to learn from this DOA mess is:   This is likely to happen if Segwit with it's '29 parallel soft forks' is rushed. Bitcoin should remain an open dumb base layer with all the complexity added as layer 2. KISS. KISS. 
@_date: 2016-06-30 13:57:00
I know there will be a 'sky is falling' crowd. Before you start in on the 'Chinese threat' maybe realize that this is how bitcoin is supposed to work. Majority vote with hash power. 
@_date: 2016-06-30 14:32:29
To understand this you need to see the bigger picture. It's an entire organic ecosystem. Miners are essentially judges or arbiters of what the free market desires. They act in their own self interest. That self interest is aligned with the bitcoin economic majority.(Satoshis masterstroke) (Holders, merchants, exchanges, etc)    
 It helps to game these things out in your head. What would likely happen if all miners started producing 100BTC per block? Would that be good for the ecosystem/price or bad? Aligned incentives and game theory control bitcoin the code is just a guide rail. - Everyone is free to use whatever code they like or alter it as they see fit.

This is such absolutist thinking. 'I'll never climb that mountain so I shouldn't bother getting off the sofa'. There is a nice mid term fix here, everyone knows it.

Freework is right this is currency 'Adoption is the most important metric that bitcoin should worry about.'
@_date: 2016-06-18 15:21:59
Yup it works great for the 300,000 transactions that can happen each day. Not so great for the 300,001st transaction that will have to wait until tomorrow because the future of money and finance can only service the size of a small town.
@_date: 2016-06-18 14:12:17
Agreed. Let's try a simple hardfork blocksize increase. A hardfork test drive if you will. Once thats done we can do the much cleaner Segwit hardfork when it's had the gremlins tested out of it.

ok. I don't want to get into more heated discussion. It's clear we disagree. I see hard forking as the only honest way to upgrade the network when there is a controversial decision to be made. The fact that you can change nearly any parameter via soft fork is a huge problem. See vitaliks 'softforking_the_block_time_to_2_min_my_primarily' I can't link here as it gets removed. :/    
I think you may have misunderstood the previous medium post, as it clearly shows how keeping a 1MB block limit IS changing the 21mil limit, by adding inflation into our supposedly inflation proof currency. When you understand this point you will see both (honest) sides of this debate want to same thing, to protect the sound money aspect of Bitcoin. From an economic perspective this is an absolute line that can not be crossed.     
    
So If the Core team refuses to ever do a hardfork and the economists refuse to degrade the sound money properties of bitcoin, the only logical solution is to find a way to make the blocksize freely floating via soft fork.
@_date: 2016-11-24 00:03:33
You've fallen for the fallacy that cheap transactions means lower BTC price. Utility and the sound money aspects are essential, and of equal importance to the overlying code. They both need to remain aligned or disputes like these will tear the ecosystem in two.     
    
Layer 2 thunder etc are also necessary but without a free market on main chain blockspace this feud will continue until we have two chains. (and I don't believe anyone really wants that?) [This is another good read to get the economic perspective.]( it's quite sad that many laugh off the economic incentives that make bitcoin function. They are intrinsic to the well-being of the network. Dismissing them is foolish.

One thing most Core Developers have overlooked ( or not considered important enough ) are the economic incentives that make bitcoin function as sound money. Precisely why this debate will never go away until it is resolved. From an economic perspective, keeping the 1MB limit is a direct attack on 21Milion coin limit.

@_date: 2016-12-16 18:34:06
I don't think any BU compatible node would choke on a 1GB block, so nothing. (is there not a 32MB limit in there somewhere to stop this already?)(needs fact check).  I can guarantee you the uproar from the community would be deafening, so I doubt this behaviour would be tolerated long.     
    
With the Orphan risk, parallel validation, and the enormous incentives miners face to do what's in the best interest of the network and their livelihood, these forces are sufficient to contain the median blocksize.     
    
Not to mention you'd need a regular supply of non zero fee paying transactions in the first place.

On [Hardforks.]( these are a transparent development tool, and not to be feared.


   
Clearly wrong. For big blocks to be happen, there must already be 75% of hashing power support. When that happens the first big block can be mined, before that bigger blocks are not mined.
So now you have 75% of the network working on a chain that supports bigger blocks and mining bigger blocks, whilst 25% try to mine a chain that only contains &lt;1MB blocks.
Which chain will very quickly becomes longest?  Everyone using bigger blocks carries on as normal, the orphaned miners on their orphaned chain can continue to try and operate as long as they like but they can't actually affect the longest chain, which gets ever longer.    
 This idea that they have two sets of coins is of no concern to anyone other than them, because they are the only people that recognise their orphaned blockchain. The coins in the new addresses on their orphaned chain cannot be spent on the main chain because they don't exist there.    
On Wallets: Nearly all of these will simply follow the longest chain no code change necessary. nothing to see here. 
On exchanges. Again longest chain will quickly win out, so his 'Handful' (which is more like a massive majority at this point.) will have already be on the longest chain.      
 
 &gt; To claim that high fees are a disaster is like saying ‘Nobody goes there any more, it’s too crowded.’
   
He also ignores the hundreds of companies that rely on free/minimum fees counterparty colorded coins fatcom ect.

At scale, nodes that don't mine are unimportant to the functioning of the network. Bitcoin remains trustless and p2p by using  SPV; see section 8 of the whitepaper. The most profitable network to the miners, will be the dominant chain, and as the halvings keep coming, Tx fees become the main source of mining incentive, it's inevitable.

Failure to understand the majority economics of hard forks is a tragedy in the making. It's not by accident that the whitepaper mentions 'majority' 7 times. The 51% majority is built implicitly into the protocol to force miners and nodes onto the same chain. There is no significant danger to a hard fork apart from some very short term disruption. Soft forks are actually far more insidious as they upgrade without notifying the network.
@_date: 2015-07-07 22:42:35

That's your quote, I just didn't format my post correctly. 
   
 Point is this will only be the case within a very narrow set of parameters.  In fact it acts as a bandpass filter on transactions ensuring bitcoin will never scale. Too few and there was never enough demand. Too many and they are driven off onto alternate chains.   
As for the rest you seem to be deflecting and trolling so i'll save a response.

It will reduce the minimum transaction fee to get a confirmation, but increase the total transaction fees collected by miners.

You are wrongly assuming this is a technical matter. The blocksize is being misused as an economic policy tool.       
 
Do you turn to the CTO and ask what the price should be tomorrow? Or what country is most likely to benefit from bitcoin next? It is for the same reason no one can give you a decent answer on 'when a block should be considered to be at the ideal threshold or contain too many transactions'.     
   
The reason no technical solution can be provided for these questions is that they are fundamentally questions of economics, not engineering.  The basic supply (block space) vs demand (transactions) cannot be accurately predicted or engineered away.

Virtually all of Core came from QT what's your point?
@_date: 2016-02-03 22:49:15


Your premise is flawed.     
To rephrase accurately. There is potentially unlimited demand for blockspace if it were a free commodity.    
Now we can see the problem with your argument. Blockspace, even with an unlimited bound is never without cost. There is a cost of storage and a cost of propagation. Miners and nodes bear these costs. Miners do so for profit, nodes do so for security. Therefore they alone are in a position to dictate 'most efficient use of the blockspace commodity'. 
@_date: 2016-02-03 19:25:45
If blockstream are acting in the best interests of the ecosystem they should relinquish control of the main implementation and let their amazing work stand on its own. Instead they are sneakily changing the economic incentives without due diligence. 
@_date: 2016-02-11 15:17:07
I think this illustrates just how much he fails to grasp the problem. This is not a technological debate it is an economic one. A free market on the blockspace commodity is the only real solution, many have yet to see this.

A fee market exists without the need for a block size limit.

@_date: 2016-02-11 21:36:38


this has never been the case in bitcoin history until the last few months.


With a fixed blocksize, fees will only increase per transaction. This will push all small value transactions to altcoins or sidechains. Inevitably collapsing the whole system as an altcoin becomes more universally useful. A non code limited blocksize will be free to absorb as much value as is economically available.


this is childish and simply naive. World experience and understanding of economic incentives are not a pre requisite for becoming a dev. They are essential to run a multi million dollar business on fine margins.


The logical flaws in this statement are beyond me.
It will never become popular if Core devs continue to choke the vital network effect, but cutting off use cases due to lack of education in economic theory.

The tragedy is not realising that up until about 6 months ago 'the blocksize limit' had absolutely zero effect on the number of transactions. The reason was due to miners organically limiting themselves to the supply and demand of transactions. We've had a free market from day 1.
@_date: 2016-02-24 15:32:04


If there was no block reward this debate would have been over months ago. Miners would instantly realise their only revenue stream comes from MAINCHAIN transactions. We get those through adoption, enticing new users and new use cases, not by blocking them out and sending them to altcoins.

I think you're misunderstanding how bitcoin works. Each BTC address has its own corresponding private key. Simply send the BTC from your Xapo wallet to a new address in your Ledger wallet. The ledger wallet stores the new private keys for any addresses it creates.  Now you are in full control.    
 However since it seems you are quite new to this, I'd suggest for a little while keeping most of your BTC with xapo and make a few small transactions to and from your ledger wallet to get a better grip of how things work. Good luck.

This applies to almost all of Asia. It 'might?' be slightly quicker if you're in one of the major cities like Singapore Tokyo, HongKong or Bangkok but even then two weeks is about standard from Europe. you had me doubting myself though, so I went and checked my accounts from three different banks in two countries 5% was the absolute minimum i've ever paid for a withdrawal under 100€ (not including the forex loss which is conveniently hidden from any statement)

This is obviously Jeffs quote so I have no idea how he came to his conclusions. However, Bitcoin has been essentially functioning  without a blocksize limit until it started to touch the hard limit fairly recently. (this recent development effectively adds a new variable in an already complex system). Best practice scientific methodology in a dynamic live system would be to keep the variables unchanged until we know more. Thus removing the 1MB cap IS the optimal solution here, (until we have more data and research) Caveat: Some large safety limit should be kept precisely becasue we just don't have enough information yet.    
*On a side note equilibrium is frequently the optimal setting when trying to understand a complex system.*
@_date: 2015-09-15 16:17:21
That doesn't exactly answer my question. Presumably running a Bitcoin node and a lightening node both require separate resources. ergo there is a financial incentive to separate the two. Doesn't this mean there would need to be some sort of unbreakable link between them?

Whilst I really respect the work you do, clearly economics is not your strong suit. Improving Bitcoin's network effect is the only way to keep Bitcoin viable long-term. The more people using and contributing to the currency and its capital the more useful it is. (It's that simple). Artificially restricting this growth at any stage in it's development, especially now, will likely set this experiment back years.

Essentially it just adds incentive for more centralization and cooperation between the big miners and pools. Thus crowding out the smaller players. I'm glad BTCC have done this, it clearly illustrates what happens when you add an artificial quota to what should be a free market commodity. (block space).     
Objective achieved transactions are driven offchain.

This is totally false. A nonmining node provides exactly zero protection from a hostile mining attack. The only protection against such an attack is to become a miner - at which point you'll have to overcome the same economic forces that prevent you from meaningfully mining today.
The only thing you are protecting yourself from is a consensus of honest miners, aka Nakamoto Consensus.
What keeps miners honest? Your node? No. Your USD. Here's why:
Miners aren't worried that your node is going to reject their block. Miners are worried that the market isn't going to pay for the bitcoins in that block.
If exchanges and investors went with big blocks, it wouldn't matter if virtually all other nodes rejected those blocks, because miners would keep earning good profits on exchange. Conversely, if almost every individual node accepted/signaled large blocks, but miners and exchanges stay on small blocks, as long as investors keep the price up, nothing will change.
Your nonmining node doesn't have any impact here. What has impact? The USD &amp; CNY dangled out on exchange. That's it.

So restrictions on blocksize act as a valve to subvert the flow of transactions offchain and into LN or other channels? That sounds like an attack to me?     
   
Edit:  Think you must have added that second sentence as I was typing.    
So if I understand correctly. For LN to be at maximum security, the main chain must have maximum security. Ergo If we trust in supply and demand to control average blocksize, and assume free movement of value between the LN and main chain. Then the LN network 'should ?' trend to a certain value % of the main chain, where Risk=Reward. Plucks figure out of R's, say 10% of the Bitcoin Blockchain value?

This is the built in incentive of orphan risk. Would you risk publishing a monster block for the gain of extra fees if this resulted in a significant % increase in you loosing the entire block? Again, the free market will naturally find the 'sweet spot'.
@_date: 2015-10-03 11:45:54
I see your point, but this scenario is not within the parameters Maxwell described above. (where block reward is less than fee) I believe this case is exactly the point where we should expect a robust fee market to develop. Cost V's Risk/reward. Call it the fee market discovery period. I believe Satoshi would have anticipated this situation.
@_date: 2015-10-15 12:59:40


This statement is false. [Average blocksize]( has been under the max size, if not, blocks would already have been full. The blocksize issue has become a red herring quota. Increased orphan risk is what prevents miners from producing large blocks. The blocksize should probably not even be in the consensus layer.
@_date: 2015-10-03 01:48:28
My understanding becomes fuzzy here. The [PeterR_talk]( explains much better than I could. Indeed I'd actually argue the opposite, in that free market supply/demand is the Only way to accurately decide the value of block space/size.    
WRT decentralization see [here]( it's a complex problem vertically and horizontally.     
   
On regulation you might be right, if that were possible, However- anonymous transactions and interactions will exist. This is fact. Hence attempting full regulation is a fools errand.    
On your last point- I agree, although for me, node count and mining are not currently the biggest problem. Alternative implementations of the client are priority. Also you are removing a variable not adding one. (we have never had a cap before. the 1MB limit  is a red herring. The new variable is that for the first time we are being constrained by this Keynesian style Quota)   
@_date: 2015-10-13 10:49:34
Ok 'devils advocate' Explain how miners don't see this as an attack on their fees? Essentially the exchanges can now move transactions privately off chain and the only fees charged go to Blockstream?
@_date: 2015-03-01 14:19:59
Good to know. Thanks for the reply.
@_date: 2017-05-19 21:20:29
Interesting. So in the scenario described where all miners start to mine with say 22million coins, would you now have a network with just mining nodes and those wallets that tolerated the change. Or would you have lots of validating wallets but no PoW to back up the network? Why is a hard fork to 22 million coins bad, but a hard fork to change PoW good? 
@_date: 2017-05-19 19:44:36
Your example is not a reason, it's a strawman. If miners started issuing more coins your node would just fork off the network. The reason miners don't create more coins is economic, and has nothing to do with what software your ~~node~~ fully validating wallet is running. Think bigger.

Not really, with one hand it appears they drive up the cost of on chain transactions, and fight 0conf. Meanwhile the other hand offers faster private offchain. This will have the effect of driving transactions into a walled garden. Miners will *lose* fees and also traders will *lose* as effectively exchanges will be able to arbitrage amongst themselves quicker than the 'non permissioned' traders.

I wasn't really referring to internal settlement. This has generally been done offchain. This is about Bitfinex, BTCC, Kraken, Unocoin, and Xapo transfering between themselves faster than traders can move BTC between exchanges thus effectively forming a Cabal on arbitrage.

@_date: 2015-11-29 19:14:03
This has yet to be demonstrated. Why not for example just monitor the last x blocks to calculated the minimum required fee? Or even make the blocks big enough so that all transactions with current minfee (x satoshi) are included. To me this is just an overly complicated fringe use case. Better solutions will present themselves once healthy price discovery for the free market value of blockspace is found.
@_date: 2015-10-02 22:52:42


Getting out of my depth here, but I don't understand this logic. Surely if a block solution is found,(subsidy is below fee scenario), game theory would suggest it is best to broadcast it ASAP and claim whatever fees it contains, rather than wait for more fee inclusion and risk another miner getting there first?

Captain pedantic but: Debit cards capped @ 0.2% Credit cards @ 0.3%.    
For cross border transactions the law should come into effect in 6 months but will take 5 years to be adopted domestically.  This is pretty daft as it will encourage people to go overseas for their bank accounts. What with negative interest rates in Denmark I think its time to get a Danish credit card, max it out, and live in Spain :-)
Also worthy of note is that the current average debit card fee is only 9cents which apparently is roughly 0.2% anyway (source: something I read, somewhere recently)

Far more likely, in this already outrageously unlikely idea, would be the trusted server, semi decentralised model. Where each 'trusted' entity be it bank, financial clearing house or tax agency etc. would have a copy of the ledger.

There is literally no way a single state could out compete Bitcoin. Who in their right mind will hold an inflationary currency V's a deflationary one?? The only feasible way this would be possible is if all of the major western governments adopted 'WestCoin' at the same time. I'd consider it a victory even in this scenario, as the necessary fiscal responsibility would vindicate the Bitcoin protocol.

@_date: 2015-10-02 23:30:57
We rapidly become circular here, mainly because of differing perspectives on the variables used to define 'decentralised'. Needless to say miners already control the blocksize and I believe, will do so in the absence of a limit.    
 As resource requirements increase the laws of cost v's supply and demand will naturally find an equilibrium blocksize. This size will eventually trend smaller than to contain all the possible transactions (single satoshi stuff) naturally forcing these transactions off chain onto LN or other payment channels.    
 
Trust in the free market economics, don't fight them.

maybe oneday paypal will integrate with bitcoin and takeaway the chargeback risk but until that day comes steer well clear

I'm sorry if I came across as arrogant that was not my intention. The questions your asking have been talked about so much there is no need for me to answer them hence the 'needless'. There are far better posts and explanations from people infinitely better equipped to respond than me. Why listen to a random such as myself on a topic that has been hotly debated by the best minds in the sector. 
try this one for starters

Ok so nothing was sent to that address. 
You've had lots of advice. Has anything worked yet?    
I notice someone said check your receiving address.
You should do this next.     
    
Click on the 'request' tab and individually check each address you have in your wallet using the blockchain.info website.
If none of the addresses contain  the 4BTC you need to see if any have recently sent that money to another address. 
hopefully this will lead somewhere.        
If you still don't have any luck you will need to post the transaction details to give people a better idea of whats going on. goto 'transactions' tab highlight the original  0.1 send and click the show transaction details icon at the bottom. good luck

you have to wait till about a month after a massive crash for any intellectual debate. Its only then that those really interested stick around. Peak bitcoin price = Peak season for muppets.
edit: although to be fair it's a trite rewrite of the 'bitcoin is volitile and deflationary therefore won't work as a currency' argument. This has been discussed ad nauseam and been debunked so many times I had to stop reading halfway through.

But most of us are on the way to figuring out that governments are consistently debasing our financial assets with QE or inflation so the need for a deflationary currency is essential.
Bitcoin may not be well known, but the gap it fills is screaming at us all.

Old news. Its been Fixed in Version Q.3.72. You only have to go to the forum to see that its being actively developed. That being said, they need more support. There is a massive task ahead of them and the project desperately needs more developers and code reviewers. 
When the governments try to shut Bitcoin down, Namecoin needs to be ready to step up and help out. If your out there ingenious coders we need you.

I'm posting this becasue it has been of incredible value to me over the past 2 years. I'm not related to the project in anyway but have noticed recently that since April very little has been added.

If your a little less techie than some in the Bitcoin world, a good halfway point is to move it to an online wallet such as

Perhaps consider doing this sort of thing in Dubai, London, Hong Kong, Bangkok, Sydney or other large cites with big populations of expatriate workers. International remittance is Bitcoins first Killer App. 
@_date: 2013-07-11 14:02:58
with 7Billion people all you would need is 70BTC to give them 1 satoshi each.
create a website with iris recognition to create an account, each unique user can claim their satoshi or donate it to those less fortunate by publicly declaring never to claim their satoshi.

@_date: 2013-07-23 05:35:04
The Concept of "A single bitcoin" is very misleading and somewhat counter productive. As most here have tried to explain, bitcoins are pretty much infinitely divisible. Therefore even a small amount can run the entire world economy. Try not to think of "A bitcoin" but instead imagine Bitcoin like water or electircity. Yes you can buy a handy bottles worth or 1KW/H but most people just turn the tap or flick the switch and use what they need.
@_date: 2013-06-13 11:02:48

Not sure if its your area but it would be nice to see a wallet with proper Taint analysis built in, keeping track of which addresses, know about each other. So easy to loose track of them.

Update from BTC-E bitcoin talk thread: 
**"Recently, we started to receive  claims because of the long-time credit of funds transferred by SEPA / WireTransfer. The main problem is that some of our clients have a negligent attitude to the control of the field Details of Payment. As the result it takes an additional time to find your money. Please, make sure, that  the information Details of Payment is always present in the document of transfer, do not shorten it, don not  use your account username."**

Russian mobsters are not stupid. They are not stealing from their clients. they are the 4th largest bitcoin exchange and with all the alt coin trading are probably one of, if not the largest cryptocurrency exchange. WHY kill the goose?
My guess, they are finally having some banking issues. There must be billions going through their books and the flow is being restricted at the one and only choke point.

Dynamic block size has been considered and talked about *(ad nausea)* . This is the first time I've heard of it being voted on by miners like this so kudos for that. However its the same answer, eventually it will lead to even greater centralisation.  Its in the interest of the larger miners to continually "Block size+" as this will slowly weed out the weaker miners.
Although I guess if you set the increment small enough it would be a steady and predictable  growth. but then were back to the 'magic numbers' game :-(
