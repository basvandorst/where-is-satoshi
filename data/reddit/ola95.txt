I have over 2000 trades on paxful with average release time for giftcard&gt;bitcoin trade of 1-2 minutes!
Most of the customers are female and just want small amount of bitcoin anonymously, also almost all are brand new to bitcoin, I must have have helped thousands of newbies get into bitcoin in the last year.
I stopped trading on LBC more or less, too many scammers
Anyways I have trades to attend to now, instead of moaning here on r/Bitcoin

Buy a onevanilla prepaid Gift visa or similar with cash, sell it on paxful.com for btc
@_date: 2016-04-14 12:58:43
it is not
@_date: 2016-04-14 13:43:25
No they dont! 
been using them for month (have no paypal, thanks shitpal) and do not want to add my debit card, been only paying with bitcoin
I use chunkhost too but they only server location are in LA, Vultr gives alot more locations which is handy.

Merchants get paid in bitcoin correct? and we pay purse 10 or 20$ a month in bitcoin too?
@_date: 2016-06-05 09:09:28
Paxful.com you can buy bitcoin with prepaid onevanilla gift cards
@_date: 2015-08-23 19:05:02
I can do it but my fee is 20%, you get 80 cent worth of bitcoin on each dollar you spend
I take Paypal, Googlewallet, Applepay, US Credit/debit cards
I do not ask for ID etc and your anonymity is preserved since the trade is via prepaid giftcard that you can buy with the above payment methods, I never get to see/touch your card details, nor care for them ;)
My first trade is always for $10, after that can do larger amounts
Here is my LBC profile and adverts

Thank you, and thank you for actually listening to traders and improving the site daily, its a refreshing change for sure
Today I made a youtube video tutorial helping buyers explain the process, since unfortunately a lot find bitcoin complicated :(
@_date: 2015-08-23 23:49:52
I know but that's the price of preserving your anonymity and privacy when everyone else asks for long trading history + ID + rectal exam
Most of my trades are with people who just want small amounts of bitcoin and do not want to spend days waiting on coinbase etc and/or want to protect their anonymity

It is to verify that the giftcard was bought in cash and hence not from a credit carder or stolen bank account (Debit card) or worse from some cryptolocker style victim
also to confirm the person is not a re-seller/middleman for the code
and finally to cut out all the timewasters
basically amazon know it was bought with cash and hence have no worries about credit card fraud
as added bonus this is the most anonymous way of getting bitcoin in US beside a cash in person meetup, had alot of lady buyers with this method who of course would be afraid to meet in person and want their privacy
tho i havent been buying many lately and only dealing with existing past buyers

I sell both on localbitcoins and paxful, had a flood of orders from paxful in the last few days (not sure what they are doing to bring in the backpage ladies)
Alot of the people do not know much about bitcoin must have helped out about 20 people from about 50+ sales
and also gave the guys at Paxful alot of feedback, it is refreshing seeing features added daily when the likes of localbitcoins are only bothering to do cosmetic UI changes :( and have no implemented various suggestions i made to help us traders
I sell $10 the first time via giftcard which can be bought with paypal, credit/debit card or googlewallet/applepay
same username on as here on both sites :)
@_date: 2015-07-20 17:10:53
Ha I get a mention :)
my comment from earlier today to reduce risk with amazon codes &gt; 
edit: had a buyer earlier today offering a $250 amazon code, I said NO since i only needed 25 max as per trade details
he then proceeded to offer a $800 per BTC rate and a scan of his ID
needless to say it got all sorts of alarm bells ringing
I found scammers are often a very impatient lot, or downright liars, No the do not f^&amp;cking sell amazon.com giftcodes in shops in Nigeria or Vietnam (no offence to anyone from there) 
@_date: 2015-07-11 16:09:44
Aha! i see
well the more people using bitcoins the better i suppose
visa/mastercard really dropped the ball here
@_date: 2015-07-22 11:21:04
Yep I recommended to your support to make video tutorials on youtube for how to pay using bitcoin on backpage etc
I made video tutorial myself showing how to buy giftcards for which i exchange my bitcoin
Had quite alot of newbies who I was happy to help, but it does get tiring, all the time spent probably wiped any profit made on each sale, but oh well i hope bitcoin works out ok in longterm
@_date: 2015-07-15 08:00:17
Considering I do not ask for ID or perform an anal exam like many traders on Localbitcoins do who accept paypal, thats a damn bargain
@_date: 2015-07-22 11:53:18
I use both, it has some features that LBC doesnt and vice versa, one thing it has going for it are the admins actually listening to us sellers, some of my suggestions have been implemented very quickly, as a seller myself I appreciate this agility and willingness to rapidly improve the site for us sellers (and buyers too)
There are some features that still needed like: 
* "trusted only" adverts, 
* limiting adverts by country from where buyer can bid since some payment methods are very local
* showing a lower limit adverts to users with new accounts so coins don't get locked up by newbies whether maliciously or not
* some way of communicating with people who trade repeatedly, most of the sales by volume usually are from same trusted network of people :) not from the $10 "introductory" sales
At the rate they are adding things it should be an improvement for sellers and buyers over LBC quite soon, if not already, in last week I had more sales on paxful than LBC
anyways the more places to trade the better IMHO

I have bought amazon.com and other codes for bitcoin on LBC and paxful for a long long time (my username is same on both sites as here), thousands of them building up a good list of trusted buyers
And in that time I have seen all sorts of scam attempts and have been scammed
When buying an amazon.com giftcode, make sure the buyer sends
1. Hiqh quality photo of the plastic card with the code at back clearly visible
2. Hiqh quality photo of a cash receipt (card number will need to match the receipt), MUST BE A CASH RECEIPT from a US shop
3. both have to be nonblurry and visible, alot of photoshop scammers
4. get them to write in pencil/pen your username on receipt!
anything else like ecode (amazon ecodes are always one character shorted than physical codes btw XXXX-YYYYY-ZZZZ vs XXXX-YYYYYY-ZZZZA ) or bought with debit/credit card in shop or no receipt
AND YOU ARE GUARANTEED to be scammed
especially if the buyer is not from US and if they in any way ignore your messages
also first time only accept small amount
so thats my tips for buying amazon codes for bitcoin, anything other than above and you will be scammed
some will also try to sell you already redeemed codes, in that case contact amazon chat support and ask as to when and who redeemed the code, most of time they will tell you and that your proof that YOU as the seller were not the one who redeemed it.
if the buyer in any way ignores any of your requirements, send them packing

I am one of the featured sellers there helping shit load of people get into bitcoin and spending hours of my time chatting to ladies explaining how to use bitcoin since it is actually quite a new concept if you never heard of it before or are a nerd like I am
here is my transaction list screenshot
@_date: 2015-07-19 10:49:39
Why should I? I am exchanging small amounts (~ $8) of a bitcoin for $10 digital giftcards with which I go shopping FOR MYSELF, hence making the most out of my bitcoin AND helping new people get into bitcoin.
In fact what I do is not too different from what purse.io are doing but at a much smaller scale.
@_date: 2015-07-14 19:19:28
Sure its in the trade details section of any of my ads to give context
@_date: 2016-05-29 09:18:02
So anytime any western authority tries to argue for a ban of bitcoin, we bitcoin supporters should point out that that would make us on par with Russia.
Which would be a kick for the proposers as no one wants to be associated with such a backward regime.
