you really should read the academic paper on Blockstack ( Namecoin was previously used, but the software turned out to be extremely unreliable and the blockchain was regularly under the control of a single miner. Further, in Namecoin DNS full data records are put directly in the blockchain, whereas with Blockstack only hashes of the data are put in the blockchain, conserving enormous amounts of space.
Also, I find it amusing that you believe that the transactions you like are ok but the transactions other people like *and pay for* are not. Spam is a concept that exists in a system without tolls. When you introduce tolls / transaction fees, any transaction is as good as any other (so long as the fee calculation method is well thought out).  Incentive compatible systems are the way to go.
Furthermore, the most important quality of Bitcoin is that it's decentralized, egalitarian, censorship resistant. Anyone can play and nobody can be censored, as long as they pay. That's the way it should be.

The point is not to ascribe any meaning or authenticity to the username. That isn't how any social network works. If I own the username "nullc" on another social network, people don't blindly assume who it is.
However, I know that nullc on reddit is "the core developer commonly known as Greg Maxwell" because multiple people have referenced this fact.
Blockstack goes further and allows individual accounts to be verified against peers (in a web-of-trust fashion) and against Twitter, Facebook, and GitHub accounts. You can create an account on Blockstack with the username "gmaxwell3" and verify it against your github "gmaxwell" (which I know is you) and then verify it against your reddit "nullc" and then you now have an account with multiple verifications.

Only data hashes are stored in Bitcoin. The data itself is stored by all of the Blockstack nodes.
@_date: 2016-08-19 17:33:57
I'll try explaining this another way.
Imagine everyone in Bitcoin Core has an account on Blockstack. Imagine they each verify their github, twitter, and reddit accounts against their usernames and signing public keys.
Now imagine a page with the binary on the left and a list of Bitcoin Core developers on the right, each with their blockstack usernames, public keys, and signatures that can be optionally manually checked.

We are blockchain agnostic but indeed the main registry set operates on Bitcoin. We are not moving to the ETH chain. We may at some point create another registry set on Ethereum or another chain, however we have not made a decision to do so.

Hey, thanks for the message. We are in complete agreement that this needs to be improved. It just comes down to progress with privacy-conscious payment methods and working with wallets to spur adoption.
And we've actually already started looking into BIP47. It seems more workable than stealth addresses and other proposed solutions.
@_date: 2015-06-25 15:51:51
Hm, I haven't seen much adoption of SQRL. Why do you prefer it over other systems?
@_date: 2014-11-15 18:39:14
What you're describing is a perfect use case for stealth addresses themselves, with no additional modifications.
Each stealth address comes with a "spend private key", which allows for the money to be moved, and a "scan private key", which allows for the viewing of payments.
1. create a stealth address
2. give a copy of the scan private key to the IRS
3. keep the spend private key to yourself
You now have enabled payments that are private to only you and the IRS.

Here's one such proposal: 
@_date: 2017-02-10 16:37:21
It doesn't rely on ICANN.
I was saying that we have to avoid a situation where TLD's collide.
For example, someone on Blockstack DNS shouldn't be able to create a .com TLD. OR if they do, it should be wrapped in another set of characters to distinguish one from the other. For example, .co.uk is different from .co. We could have a .co.blockstack so there are no collisions and it's very clear to a user when they are typing.
The key is backwards compatibility so users can use TLD's from both systems.
@_date: 2017-02-10 16:38:32
Blockstack is not dependent on ICANN at all.
I mentioned ICANN in my post as a point about backwards compatibility and preventing confusion for consumers when typing in names.

Blockstack is decentralized. It operates in a similar fashion to Bitcoin, Zcash, Ethereum, etc.
@_date: 2017-02-14 22:52:18


If you don't want your blockstack node to hold the entire blockchain, you can request all bitcoin transactions and scan through them and then throwaway transactions after processing. This is not SPV but it's lighter than a full node.

I definitely understand where you're coming from and these things are hard to balance. That said auction systems are way more complex and can severely degrade the user experience when it comes to registration.
If you pick a 24-hour period, then:
1. All name registrations would take at least 24 hours.
2. Companies like Google wouldn't have enough time to discover the system and outbid a squatter.
3. Getting a name you really want may take days and multiple rounds of bidding.

1. Onename is built in a way that users are in control of their names and identities. All keys are controlled by the user and are encrypted with user passwords.
2. Onename is one of many registrars for names on the Blockstack DNS system. Anyone can run a Blockstack resolver or registrar to get and resolve names. There's also a command line interface available for registering names, paid in bitcoins:

3. Explains that a hard fork is on the current roadmap (which is always subject to adjustment) and that it will happen at some point after the segregated witness integration, likely with Adam Back's 2-4-8 proposal.

Land-rushing is also dis-incentivized in Blockstack DNS.
1. A "first-come, first-serve" model is very desirable for a user naming system.
2. Anyone can create a namespace with their own pricing model in order to combat squatting.
3. For a given namespace, more desirable names can be configured to be more expensive, which is a nice way to dis-incentivize squatting, while still allowing less desirable names to be affordable.

A couple others have reported the issue with the site not showing up on Tor and after my most recent update, they've reported that it is now working. So I'm not sure why your case is different.

If you want to be completely trust-less, do have to run your own Blockstack node, just like you have to run your own Bitcoin node if you want to be completely trust-less.
By the way, you can run your own Blockstack node and use Bitcoin SPV and the amount of memory consumed is very low. Blockstack full nodes are actually very lightweight.

Yes, it's clear from your output that it's throwing an error due to the fact that your browser is not supporting ES6-specific features.
However, we're already using babel-core and everything is being compiled from ES6 to ES5.
It would still be helpful for me to know your browser version so I can reproduce the results and fully work through the issue.

Onename is not centralized - users encrypt their owning keys on the service and Onename is just one of many registrars (like GoDaddy) of a larger naming system called Blockstack.
Also, if you want to register your own name off of Onename you can do so with a command line interface and pay for it in bitcoins:

@_date: 2015-08-05 15:35:14
Hi, Ryan from Onename here.
And no, this wasn't in response to anything. We've been continuously building and releasing open-source components since we started. Some things take more time than others to release.
Also, I'm a fan of the thinking behind idchains. At it's core, it is simply facial recognition-based authentication combined with signed statements by institutions that link a particular image of a face to a legal person.
I'd point out that this works great for in-person contexts and it's great as a replacement for a physical ID but it cannot work well and securely online. Now, you can combine this with a private/public key-based system to get properties of both, but at this point you lose the ability to not require people to store private keys.
One other problem with the idchains proposal is it complicates things quite a bit. There's no need to go through the steps of turning an image into a private key and then an address on the blockchain. The verification graph does not need to be represented as transactions on the blockchain (and probably shouldn't be, for storage and privacy reasons).
A simpler way to go would be to have institutions digitally sign a document with an image in it that they have matched against your face in person.
@_date: 2015-07-27 18:22:01
Ryan from Onename here. Thanks for the clarifications Sam.
I'd also point out that OpenBazaar's integration with our open blockchain naming protocol in no way means they are reliant on Onename as a company or means they have to use our API for name resolution.
In fact, we encourage all who use the naming system to use our open source blockchain DNS resolver:
Further, Sam and I and the other OB1 and Onename folks are working together to integrate completely decentralized name resolution, based on allowing clients to connect to their specified DNS resolvers.
@_date: 2015-07-27 17:38:18
Hey Ryan from Onename here. We are using only open-source software for all naming resolution and identity operations. In fact, anyone can run their own blockchain DNS resolver and rely on it for name resolution:

It's actually approximately the same. Think about the total number of outputs for splitting and joining and how that affects the total amount of data that needs to be packaged into blocks.
@_date: 2015-09-12 16:41:15
Hello member, thank you for your comment.
There is no centralized API. This all relies on a decentralized set of Blockstore nodes that derive their consensus from the Bitcoin blockchain. Blockstore is essentially a service on top of bitcoin that gives it Namecoin-like functionality.
More information on blockstore can be found here: 
Also, as Muneeb mentioned in his Blockstack Summit presentation, Namecoin is simply not secure to develop on as a single miner has 67% of the hashing power at the moment, which makes it very centralized.
@_date: 2015-09-15 22:06:48
First of all, there's a clear incentive for apps that want a trust-less identity system. They need to run their own nodes.
As far as users, those who want to register their own usernames will run their own nodes. I could see some blockstore wallets emerging over time and they would be similar to Armory in that Armory plugs into a bitcoind node and a blockstore wallet would plub into a blockstored node which plugs into bitcoind.
Keep in mind that it's much less intensive to run a blockstored node than it is to run a bitcoind node. So if you have someone running bitcoind already, it's easy to add blockstored on, so long as they consider it important. For example, see this comment by John Light where he says they would like to have Bitseeds shipped with blockstored alongside bitcoind: 
@_date: 2015-09-12 16:42:53
We had to increase our fees because of the high volume of outstanding transactions.
Later on we will be sending transactions with lower fees.
@_date: 2015-09-15 17:29:43
No, there's no private consensus network. Anyone can and should run a blockstore node. Further, the consensus is provided by the underlying blockchain. In that, so long as the clients have the same logic for interpreting the sequence of events, they cannot possibly change the sequence itself, as that happens on the blockchain level.
@_date: 2015-09-09 15:38:24
For reference, I tried to claim the money in one of the accounts and this is the raw TX that I had to generate:
   
The TX is ~20,000 bytes and didn't get accepted by the network because of all the dust transactions.
@_date: 2015-09-09 15:32:58
Please don't criticize my post if you haven't done the math yourself.
They said thousands will be posted tomorrow, and each private key has a balance that is built up from LOTS of outputs, so each transaction that would sweep the key would NOT be 250-500 bytes but rather something like 5000-25,000 bytes. Just putting a dozen of these in each block would clog up the network. If even 3,000 keys were released throughout a day with this amount of outputs this could fill the remaining space in 150 blocks and thus clog up the network for a whole day.
@_date: 2015-09-12 16:41:57
Ryan from Onename here - no, that is incorrect.
This is completely decentralized and even more decentralized in practice than Namecoin because the code is open and much more accessible to developers because it's easy to read and edit:
Also, as was mentioned in Muneeb's presentation at the Blockstack summit, a single mining pool has 67% of the hashpower on Namecoin. Namecoin is not decentralized and not secure.
@_date: 2015-09-30 12:05:43
Hey Ryan from Onename here.
Very unfortunate that this came out, as it appears to be a desperate attempt by a single Namecoin developer to discredit Blockstore in order to save Namecoin from being completely obsoleted by it.
Blockstore is superior to Namecoin in both features and security, and this article is simply spreading FUD.
I'll go through the points in summary of the article one by one:


The short version is that blockstore definitely supports lightweight nodes. We'll be publishing a blog post on exactly how this works very soon.


The information one gets from the DHT is hash-validated by the record in the blockchain which means you can get it from anywhere without trusting the source. The DHT is just one possible source of information and we have set up mirrors to ensure data redundancy and allow anyone to run a mirror in addition to a DHT node. Further, the data in the DHT gets periodically data mined and re-populated as needed by mirrors, to ensure there is no data loss whatsoever. This has been extensively tested.


This is simple FUD, as mentioned. In the extremely unlikely chance that this ever happened, we could easily implement a form of operation obfuscation, so censorship wouldn't be possible. Why would you be more worried about this than miners not merge mining your alt-coin?


This demonstrates a simple lack of understanding of our system.
@_date: 2015-09-09 14:40:40
So essentially CoinWallet.eu is "canceling" the stress test &amp; giving away private keys so others will move the coins for them and inadvertently do the stress test themselves. Am I interpreting that correctly?
@_date: 2015-09-15 14:31:19
Every app that needs it's own local copy of the state of the namespace will be running its own node. It's also really simple to run a node, way simpler than running even bitcoin core (not even comparable to Namecoin).
So yes, it's designed to be quite decentralized and have lots of people running nodes.
@_date: 2015-09-10 02:55:09
Absolutely! Great thinking. Take a look at the docs on Blockchain ID:  A few people including myself are working on building out blockchain-based identity.
@_date: 2015-09-09 23:28:54
Yes, true. I guess I was assuming that re-spending with that low amount wouldn't get accepted by miners. I would think they would have to splinter the BTC and use many outputs per TX. But if they don't have to then you're right, splitting would take up more space.
@_date: 2015-09-14 13:49:27
There are many, many factual inaccuracies in this article. Quite disappointed here.
It claims that Onename is built on a centralized service but it is in fact building on Blockstore, a namecoin-like service on top of Bitcoin with open source code and for which anyone can run a resolver. *Completely* decentralized.
It claims that BitAlias is decentralized and yet there is absolutely no open source code to be found and no way for any individual to run a resolver: 
It claims that running Blockstore requires Linux but I can easily run it on my Mac.
It claims that on Blockstore, miners can register names for free and yet Blockstore uses proof of burn, so that's definitely not the case.
It claims that the names on Blockstore that Onename uses are not scarce, but that couldn't be further from the truth, as names in fact do cost money to register on the system.
@_date: 2015-11-17 15:06:12
I would say both matter. But regardless, in that case the thing we should care about measuring (the effect) is the gini coefficient of mining - not the factors going into that measurement (block size, etc.).
@_date: 2015-11-13 18:12:11
OK I'm taking a crack at going through these metrics:


This is very important - it should be at least in the high thousands, ideally much more. However, we don't want to count 10,000 nodes being run by a single entity, as that is a sybil attack and decreases the decentralization of the network rather than increasing it. Thus even better than this would be a measure of the number of unique organizations running nodes. This is impractical to measure, but we might be able to estimate it.


What we really should be asking about is something along the lines of a gini coefficient for mining.


This shouldn't be measured, because while it directly affects the number full nodes, that's the number we actually care about. If hypothetically the number of full nodes didn't drop with an increased block size (it very likely would), then the block size increase wouldn't matter. Thus, we should just use the actual metric that indicates decentralization - node count.


At least a few.


The important metric is really the percent control of the largest mining pool, as that is what directly impacts the likelihood that a transaction is safe / the number of blocks you should wait to accept a transaction.


At least a few, and decentralized exchanges would be ideal.

1. Multisig broadcasts your security model to the world.
2. If your wallet uses a particular multisig scheme, it becomes easier to identify your addresses (e.g. with input1=2of3, output1=normal_address, and output2=2of3, then output1 is probably the merchant)
3. If one of your devices is compromised, you have to move your stash to a new multisig address, which is basically broadcasting to the attacker and the world that the security of one of your devices was compromised.
Threshold signatures, on the other hand, use secret sharing combined with an innovative signature technique that lets separate devices alternate in signing a message without ever combining the shares :o (this is a big deal).
This method is awesome because nobody will ever be able to distinguish between a normal address and a threshold address (so they can't identify your outputs in transactions involving normal addresses), nobody will know what your m-of-n is, and if a device is ever compromised, you can recombine the key, re-split it, destroy the old shares and redistribute the new ones and nobody will ever know you updated your security.

That's a great idea. That would do well to reduce spam, but unfortunately it wouldn't incentivize people to run DHT nodes. On the other hand, maybe the former is the more pressing problem to solve.

1. This site provides a live breakdown of OP_RETURN transactions by protocol: 
2. The software formerly known as Blockstore is now called Blockstack (
3. Certain non-currency transactions, like many Counterparty transactions, don't use OP_RETURN.
4. Certain OP_RETURN transactions, like stealth transactions, are actually currency transactions (although there are very few of these).
5. The OP is Arvind Narayanan, who taught one of the top courses on cryptocurrencies and co-authored several papers referencing Namecoin, Onename, and Blockstack.

I would say that immutability and censorship resistance are really two sides of the same coin. They're properties that are present only if there is sufficient decentralization of the network and there would be sufficiently high resources required to take over the network. If that decentralization isn't there, then neither property is there.
