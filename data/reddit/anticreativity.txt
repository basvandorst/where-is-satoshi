Why cant people recognize bitcoin for its trade potential?  Just because I use bitcoin doesn't mean I'm trying to hide something.  Not all of us are murders and drug users.  Maybe the upside to the SR bust will be that we don't have to be associated with that kind of shit anymore.

Same here.  I feel kinda bad for the people getting arrested over drugs, but they had to know this was coming.

I'm not sure you understood my point.  I'm saying that although the Silk Road's existence helped drive up the value and notoriety of bitcoin, it was always going to reach this status on its own merits.  I don't have any disdain for the people who used bitcoin for the Silk Road.  It was kind of annoying that bitcoin was so closely associated with it in the media, making people who are just interested in the trading potential/curiosity of the currency associated with it by effect, but other than that the Silk Road helped to get bitcoin where it is today.  So regardless of the shady activities that might have happened surrounding Silk Road, you still have to appreciate its impact on the value of bitcoin.

Bitcoin was always more than Silk Road.  I appreciate what those dudes did in terms of jump starting the currency, but it was bound to become what it is now and what it will be, with or without people trying to buy drugs with it.

I don't know why you're making assumptions or having such a bad attitude. Everyone else is being helpful and informative and you're just kind of being a dick.

How do I get that extra verification?  Wait 30 days?
@_date: 2013-08-01 01:41:33
I did not know that. I placed my order when I found out.

Actually I've purchased plenty of bitcoins over the last few years. It's just become increasingly inconvenient to get them and I'm looking for new methods. So I'm just fine being part of the secret club, thanks.
