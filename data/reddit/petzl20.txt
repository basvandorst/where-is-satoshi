Dont malign poker please.
Buying crypto is like gambling as much as  investing in a new stock is gambling.

So, "No" to coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:27:14
could be worse. you couldve bought at 19.9k.
@_date: 2015-12-13 14:20:26
So, bitcoin is more like a volatile stock than a  currency.

Ron Paul thinks the EPA, FDA, OSHA should be eliminated, too. He was against ADA, anti-segregation laws. 
That he's against bitcoin laws is just a coincidence. The guy just doesn't like laws.

They seem to be taxing a BTC transaction as if it were a stock, rather than a currency.

Also, if anyone finds a good, automated coin flip game, I'd be interested. 
Hopefully, with a proxy to allow me to wager while within the US.

Sorry to be dense, but if this is Nakamoto, he himself has $400Mln of BTC, why would he need contributions?
@_date: 2014-03-08 08:47:55
Well, except your definitions are specious. 
Unless your above definitions are intended to be seen as being from the point of view of a propagandist.
"Laws" and "regulation" are the same thing.

1933 obviously was a great time to have money!
deflation!  my money is actually gaining in value just by doing nothing!  i love it!
oh, wait-- there's nothing to buy. :(

How did it go from $2k to $3k so quickly?
Is there a ELI5?
@_date: 2017-08-14 02:04:51
That's a joke(?)
@_date: 2017-08-14 02:06:27
Selling now for a business is a smart move.  Especially if you only have 1BTC.
BTC cant keep going up $1K/week.
This screams bubble. It's going to burst.
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:03:58
Ya gotta believe!
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:27:31
just look at the short term!  it cannot rise 1K every 3 days!
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:29:57
And greed will be what will cause the bubble to burst.  
Its just a matter of when the market becomes saturated by Chinese buyers who start to profit-take.

And since she's  exactly 5, she was perfectly adapted for it and it all made sense!

OK, so *Now* can I sell?
@_date: 2017-10-08 01:55:05
But, it didn't happen!!
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:47:36
Make sure you hodl it!  Resist the urge to sell!

Pretty sure China didn't hand over gold for all the T-bills they own.
@_date: 2016-10-21 17:36:59
True.  Gold will be king.

It's probably a troll.  Who takes out a loan and immediately pours 100% of it into a commodity?  It's a complete loser play.
@_date: 2017-05-09 19:10:17
Is it at `First Sell Off` or at `New Paradigm!!!`
I'm asking for a friend.

but, why would someone lie on the internet?
@_date: 2017-05-12 01:09:58
well, i need to know for sure. the funds from my home equity loan need to be invested asap.
@_date: 2017-05-09 17:55:15
This isn't investing. Taking out a loan and putting your entire net worth into a single commodity is gambling. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 08:03:51
True, but as deflation continues, shop owners go out of business because no ones buying anything. There's fewer and fewer things to buy (that you can't buy).
@_date: 2016-07-29 01:00:58


It does.  In the massive charges they apply for ATM fees and check fees. 
 I'm amazed that banks can get away with this, if it's true (negative interest rates).
They cannot break up these big banks fast enough.
@_date: 2016-07-29 02:22:55
Why is he buying these bitcoins in cash  in the first place, and not a check? Both parties are shady to begin with.
