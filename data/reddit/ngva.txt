Chinese pools said they support 8MB blocks but not the fork.

BIP 100 gives miners more power, so no surprise !

They mean the fork that Gavin and Mike is pushing. If BIP 101 is adopted by Core the fork would happend smoothly since consensus has reached.

No surprise, Jeff Garzik is a member of Bitfury team.

Number of XT or Core nodes is irrelevant. In order to trigger the fork, 750 of last 1000 blocks need to be mined from pro-XT miners, and this is not going to happen.
In short, only miner has ability to vote, node operator doesn't.

No it doesn't. Hashrate come from processors, not memory.

The compromised email was the one with  address. This  wasn't.

Only 2% ? Nah Bitcoin lost 15% of its value in one day.

Apparently, Jeff Garzik's BIP 100 is heavily influenced by Blockstream developers: 
I love how Blockstream devs argued that BIP101 is too aggressive but they endorse a proposal which would change Bitcoin even more aggressively.

I'm curious how do you fake XT-mined blocks and hashing power ?

Very few people think that message was legit. In fact it doesn't matter because the community was thinking Dorian isn't Satoshi even without "him" denying that.
@_date: 2015-08-28 05:54:30
not yet, just an idea.
@_date: 2015-08-16 05:09:53
stop spreading that BS, if he was real Satoshi he would have signed that message with PGP key.

Thanks Gavin

TL;DR: A developer working for a mining firm (Bitfury) proposed a solution which give miners more control, and this proposal gains enormous support from miners.

I think using change addresses should be disabled by default in all wallet. Some people forgot to backup private keys for these addresses and hence lost money.

he's not a core dev.
@_date: 2015-09-01 17:58:40
you mean user btcdrak ?
@_date: 2015-09-01 17:55:02
nice idea. but i don't believe this will be adopted by miners. BIP 100 is created to keep blocksize small in the excuse of 'community consensus'.
