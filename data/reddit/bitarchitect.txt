That's what I'm doing, but I think that's not the point. This is about feeling despair.
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:11:51
Hahaha what? Are you serious? I've **never** shorted bitcoin, and of course I’m not at a loss. I could even sell everything at a price way lower and still make profit; I've been holding so many years. But that's not the point. I don't even trade, I'm sort of a maximalist. That's why I thought my thoughts could matter. I'm just telling how I feel these days. Period.
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:28:01
Yes, I totally agree. I guess this time is a bit bitter compared with previous ones just because 20k per coin was life changing, and I didn't sell (because I’m a sick hodler and believer). Feels like the kind of regret that makes you want to sell at the bottom.
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:14:50
Thank you. Finally someone gets it. That's exactly how I feel.

Nothing so far; I’m not sure if I will earn something in the future, but... nothing as of now
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:18:31
Yep, I think you might be right. I remember perfectly. And thinking it that way makes me calm down again. After all, I still remember when the price was at $5, and we dreamed about reaching $500 one day in the future....
Maybe I've lost perspective.

For Android you can use Eclair Wallet. However, if you use iOS like me, your only option is running a node on your computer.
(There are wallets for both iOS and regular computers, but I think most of them run on testnet)
Eclair: 
**edit:** thanks to , this one might be better (for Android):

I've been into Bitcoin since 2012, and I've gone through all the bubbles we had before, Hodling every one of them.
But honestly, this looks (and feels) bad.
I'm starting to think that maybe Bitcoin has no value, and that maybe I've been wrong all this time. 
Just take a look at the comments here and tell me how you feel reading **normies**. Makes me doubt. Every comment. It's like if every fudster around was right since the beginning:  
Trying to be rationale about this, all this can only mean one thing: This is the bottom... or maybe I've been really wrong, and Bitcoin is dead.  At this point, I don't really know. 
Edit: So I get downvoted for telling you how I feel, trying to know if we are already on the so called ‘Despair’ phase? You are incredible guys.

Any official source for this? The only I've found dates back to November
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:04:48
Probably similar, but honestly, I was just too busy with college, and also the price wasn't that high back then. We were still waiting for “big money” and “retail investors”, and apparently they all came in already last December. I don't really know. I love and trust this technology, it's just... Despair. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:20:08
Maybe I don't want people to associate my original name with coins from 2012, bought at $5. Maybe.
@_date: 2018-11-22 22:16:16
Good to know! I thought Eclair was the only one. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:24:56
I guess It's understandable to doubt of a message posted from a new account like mine.
I give you that.
But believe it or not, I haven't ever shorted bitcoin. I don't trade.
I have no open shorts, I fully trust the protocol, and **Nothing** would make me happier than bitcoin regaining its ATH.
The only thing I'm saying, is that I'm losing confidence, and starting to doubt about everything. And **hopefully** that means we are at the bottom. Nothing else.
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:07:56
What the heck are you talking about? Whatever.
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:35:34
I’m not trolling, you got it wrong.
Believe it or not, I’m sort of a permabull. 
The feeling you gather from a subreddit like this is not representative, we are all geeks; Precisely that’s why I put TheVerge as an example of what the regular normie feels. And I’m starting to feel the same.
I’m just saying how I feel right now, being here since 2012. That’s all. I’ve not sold a single coin btw. But I want to. Or I feel like I should have. Is this despair? Maybe. And that’s the reason why I’m telling you all this. Are we there yet? Am I alone? I don’t know.
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:27:53
Yep, reading my post again, I acknowledge it might be hard to tell; I just wrote it from my phone, and...
When I cool down, I totally agree with you there; I would only sell if there is some kind of screw up (technologically speaking), and that’s not the case. Hell, I just set up a LN node myself and announced it here a couple of days ago! It’s just that I can smell Despair in the air, and I’m feeling it myself sometimes.
ps: excuse all my **’** for not being **'**. Not English keyboard.

Yep, I'm really waiting for neutrino as well. I'm a iOS developer myself, and I want to create a LN wallet for mobile... but as you have said, sync time is crazy. Too bad neutrino is still in testnet!
However, we also need to be real here. Many of us are going to run nodes, That's for sure. But not our friends, family, and average joes. They will have hardware wallets and mobile wallets, but won't be running their servers. Just like they have webs, but not servers. So we still need a way of getting LN payments without being online in a few days. Is this possible?. I'm starting to think that a custodial wallet with periodic withdrawals is not that bad, and is really convenient for adoption. After all, we are talking about small amounts in LN. On-chain Bitcoin is a different story. Not your keys, not your coins :)
@_date: 2018-12-04 22:52:48
That’s super cool! The only downside I guess is that you need a node though. Other than that, beautiful UI
