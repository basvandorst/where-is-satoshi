Most of all crypto services do not provide direct support. What the hell did you expect ? You are only one of the one millions customers they are claiming to have account with them - as far they really exist - and all of them are doomed.
PS: All want your fiat only ;-)

It's never to late under an investment POV - buy ! 
If there are really some minor price adjustments after Aug 1 they will be recovered very much fast and you will own BTC+BCC and make min. 20% before you have to start about wondering how to deal the 2x adjustment.

there are very less loan offers then normally, i.e. BTC already withdrawn for the one who is looking to get BCC or BTC lended already.
There is a possible price drop in BTC  from ca. 10% as consequence of the HF. If you loan for a margin trade with a leverage of ca. 3 you could cash in within 2d 3x10% and will end up with 30%-2x4%=&gt;20% on such a trade.
Where does the -10% come from ? Just look on the price for the BCC future = try to figure out that the price for BTC for the HF will be the sum of price for BTC+BCC after the HF. I would wish we will end up with BTC now=BTC after HF and BCC = bonus.  .... but who knows ... look, the price for BTC should be very much higher already !

After all I would never recommend someone to use coinbase , never. If not done already user should withdraw everything to private key stores and/or reliable exchanges.

We will see. Also I can't predict the future I've seen such things a lot of time already in legacy investment environments, e.g. stock splits, spinoffs, dividend payments, etc.. Don't start a discussion if crypto behaves like a stock market .... please don't, it's finished !
