Because for a few hundred million dollars bitcoin can be compromised, right?  That's the 51% attack they talk about.  Try that with the US$ and see how fast drones stop that nonsense.  There is military power defending government-backed fiat currency.  There is nothing to stop China or the US or even Google from undermining the current bitcoin network.  
I'll store my value in the currency that has guns defending it.

Gold standard, 1800's USA?
Check out the part called "Problems with returning to the Gold Standard"

Meh.  He did a very risky thing.  Calling it stupid really depends on his family situation, tolerance for poverty, and knowledge of the subject.  It could have been smart, though I would still call it riskier than my tolerance.

And how about the savings that I don't need to spend today?  Shall I invest it and risk losing it for gain, or just hoard it and watch it's value rise risk-free and tax-free?

Read the portion of [this link]( that talks about problems with returning to a Gold standard. There are many parallels to bitcoin, and I think rather than assume everyone is either progressive or stuck in their views, you should see the evidence against things like deflationary currency.
You frame this as a logical debate with who's right and who's wrong to be determined by bitcoins' success.  I think that it's fair to say even if bitcoin is successful in the future, buying it now is a gamble, and wishful thinking.  Speculation can be a bad risk that pays off in the end.  Investors see this all the time.

Only if your bitcoin assets are taxed for the appreciation in value due to deflation.

I didn't get that message from his post.  I thought his point was the fewer resources spent on creating currency the better.  Hence paper better than gold, and resource-free digital would be best.  
The analogy fails in the absence of a central bank; with no issuing authority, bitcoin required a different system.
