Yes i dodged a bullet last year before it all started but then on 2 occasions with small amount I was stalled for 8 weeks and 2 weeks on 2 withdrawals...just a couple of bitcoin on that occasion. In June I got 90 bitcoin though allright.

Bitcoin is digital gold. It will be the preferred store of value for it's advantages like transportability over physical gold. That is exactly what Bitcoin should try to be and nothing else.

A currency cannot enter circulation at 7 transactions per second and 10 minutes or more for you to be able to leave with the product you purchased. Bitcoin is now a store of value and nothing more. It need to see itself as this to survive.

Bitgold will allow you to spend gold with a debit card and you can buy gold with BTC

Try xapo and just use their debit card... or wait for Plutus mobile app but will take a while for that to release.

Yes because bitcoin can handle thousand of micro payments per second.

It needs to be 1000 / second and that is soon. 
The demand for bitcoin is going to soar in next few months as the stock markets crash and everyone wants gold. 
There is only a limited supply of physical gold which will be bought up in the first day of the stock market crash. After that the next best thing is digital gold... enter Bitcoin. 
It will be the worst experience a new comer could have if they have to wait hours or many many more to receive their new supposedly instant digital bitcoin. 
This will scare them to the main competing digital currency unless this problem is resolved fast. 
By the time the halving happens is probably too late
