Are they ill-tempered?

Thanks for the feedback! Forgot to mention. The merchants in these posts are NOT a list of all the  merchants. We're highlighting a select few merchants every day. There's a lot more to come!

We plan to add all of the merchants to coinmap ourselves. Thanks for the help! :)

Hi OP,
Really sorry for the inconvenience. We're releasing a quick bug fix, and purchasing and adding bank accounts is disabled for the next few hours. We'll be back up soon! :D

Hey! Yanni here from SNAPCARD. We're adding credit cards soon -- lots more to do for that though.
@_date: 2015-03-12 04:54:00
Thanks! Looking into that right now -- I'm 99% confident it a frontend issue. Will report back on pm with more details soon.

Our wallet beta is open to US customers at the moment. International support (including Canada) will be available in the next few weeks :)

Hey, Yanni here from SNAPCARD. Looking into this right now. Thank you! It seems like we're displaying a really bad error message :(
@_date: 2015-03-12 05:44:40
Hey hey! Yanni here again. We're simply a broker in this exchange (people buying bitcoin). I think, overall, our rates are very competitive -- this is something that the whole team worked hard to accomplish. As volumes increase, naturally our rates will get better :) 
@_date: 2015-03-12 04:51:39
Ah! yup, we're working with our payments provider to add more banks to the system. Within the next couple weeks, though, we should have more banks into the system -- working on it right now. Ping up at support with your bank name.. we can see if it's in the next batch.
@_date: 2015-03-12 22:56:44
yeah, our good friends at bitpagos.com can do this (i believe).
@_date: 2015-02-23 21:25:35
We're reaching out to Etsy to make an easy way to accept BTC on Etsy shops :)
