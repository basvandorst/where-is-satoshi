Seriously! I own both btc and bch and actually really like coinbase (they've done a lot for bitcoin and I don't think the price would be what it is now without them and companies like them).
But if you don't hold the private keys to your bitcoin, it isn't actually yours. Should never be leaving any amount of bitcoin on an exchange long term.

Yes to both, I've had an account a long time and have probably spent a lot of money over the life of the Xbox 360.

First half of the first paragraph has me wondering if it was some superstitious nonsense or something. Then I hit the word "reptiles" and realized what I was reading.. If the title really is serious I don't even know what to think...

A lot of people don't get this about reddit. The voting system encourages what people call "circle-jerking". That being said there are subreddits that have balanced discussions but is definitely not one of them.

With that amount of btc on there, its definitely worth paying for a professional data recovery service.

Well theoretically, you could have machines that are capable of repairing other machines (including their fellow repair bots). The jobs that would stick around in a post scarcity society, are those requiring creativity. People that design or create new things that haven't been made before.
