I just feel that ops post comes across as being "for the cause"  type of tone.  But it's obvious is just  "for the profit" 
Basically trying  to  profit off the latest fad. You don't need to have vested interest in btc  to be able to profit off increased adoption.  Since they are making so much per client for such an implementation.  This is already more profitable than any short term rise in btc  appreciation. 
Showing everyone here that it's totally easy to net sales was just a convenient consequence and gets them karma for posting something positive to this circle jerk community. It also nets them free advertising

Seeing as how bitcoin replaces a lot of what visa and MC do. The only opportunity for them is to compete with businesses like circle and scale it to their current size. And then integrate it with plastic. Theyd have to add fraud protection measures which is harder for bitcoin without compromising privacy. But i guess it could work. They're not entirely screwed

You know whats funny is that if you reword it from a completely positive viewpoint
They could be shorting the market to turn a profit and resolve their solvency issues to bring their cash balance back in line with their books
This screws over the speculating traders and ppl burnt by insider trading
but its the most effective way (From an overall btc community perspective) to fix any solvency issues and announce to market that all is good now as if nothing was ever wrong.
This would stablise the market again
This of course assumes that MtGox are completely selfless people

this is true
steve jobs personal charity is registered as a private business requiring him to pay taxes. which is a waste of resources
but it allows him to keep his activities private as non profits have to pub'icly disclose their finances
using bitcoin would solve all of these issues

I'm only down cause of fkn mtgox. I doubled my money but list it all in gox. But the drop in price allowed me to double down. Based on my limited experience btc is definitely a hold
@_date: 2014-03-03 03:15:45
All that falls under operating costs and shareholders only get a slice called netprofit
The auditors and programmers won't be working pro bono
Hell I'm sure a lot of mtgox customers might be qualified to do it in the worst case scenario. They would have a vested interest to ensure it succeeds
The idea is keep it running like a business with costs and when it finally turns a profit you get paid out

bitcoin isnt really tied to any commodity or economy so its a bit different to any other currency
In fact it was quite easy to predict movements based on news relating to bitcoin alone.
because its the only real thing that drives its value
Also you can still do technical analysis on it because that still drives the ceilings, floors and resistance/support points for any currency you trade
e.g. i bought some coins at $200usd a week before it ran to $1000, because of lucky timing that i saw it was about to triple top the $200 resistance point and when it broke through, it ran nuts coupled with the news from chinese investors pouring in
i had no idea how hard it was going to run, but i did know that if it broke through, it was definitely going to go to at least $260, and if it broke that, it would reach new highs.
either way there was money to be made

i think you did a great job
You could have elaborated more perhaps regarding the liquidity by mentioning that the flash drop was mainly tied to one exchange, and the other exchanges were relatively stable drops. Also could have said that if the USD had the same number of bitcoin users, it too would see a flash drop like that because the liquidity isnt there
But you were correct in emphasizing liquidity as the main issue. You are amazing under pressure buddy
Personally i dont think that anything you would have said could have changed the opinions of the other 3 people there. They are stuck in a misinformed mindset by equating Bitcoin to a currency, whilst forgetting there is a digital, cryptographical and networking elements involved as well.
So whilst we can make analogies of the behaviour of bitcoin to fiat, things like "errrmahgahd bitcoin is digital and can be hacked" will continue to be made because these people can only allude to their basic understanding of computers and do not realise how bitcoin truly works.
Maybe keep that argument under your belt for future debates. =)

im kind of sick of hearing uninformed people talking about bitcoin getting hacked
the majority of hacking involves basic computer hacking into servers, api protocols of exchanges and peoples computers to steal their wallet
none of which are really anything to do with the fundamentals of bitcoin
So in those instances, bitcoin isnt getting hacked, its other things getting hacked to steal bitcoins
The analogy is like breaking into a banks super duper security vault to steal fiat or pick pocket a wallet
In both instances money was stolen, but doesnt indicate a flaw with the currency itself
it makes me really rage whenever i hear that misinformation spread
the bits about bitcoin being irreversable is totally stupid
If i mail you money, that money is also irreversable. Just because modern day wire transfers have chargebacks etc, doesnt mean its better than bitcoin. all its doing is providing an escrow service

@_date: 2019-09-11 03:13:09
It has alot to the bad actors in the crypto space. The scammer, the bubbles, the pyramid schemes and icos which all reduce the public trust in a system 
Granted the same applies to the fiat dollar, but you sprinkle a layer of technology called blockchain and it's enough of a barrier for people that their eyes glaZe over. What Akon did well is disregard the technology side. The importance is its benefits and similarities
Similarities being it's like swiping a credit card and driven by market value. But differences in security

you got all those skills from a single degree? no way...
i graduated in finance, but i studied computer science for a year before i switched
I managed to get a job in projects and my role basically covers the full spectrum from product/marketing/project management/business analysis/consumer analysis/IT solutions and design and of course finance and accounting.
The only thing i dont do is the final programming
Besides my current role i have trouble conceptualising where my experience and skills could fit in a tech company especially since my degree has nothing to do with Tech

i made a thousand bucks (put in $1000, gox took $50 in fees) since the last time it dipped to 90usd just watching for technical trends
when it triple topped 2 weeks ago at $200. I happened to be logged in and bought it for a punt.
Turns out 4 years of casual day trading (havent done it in ages) paid off and i sold at $245. totally pleased with myself when it crashed down to $200 again
then i blink, a week passes and its $250. I shrug it off expecting to crash
blink $300
another day passes $400
then another - $500
then this week $600
then today, refresh page BOOM $900
what turned out satisfying ended up being Fuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!! if only i held for one more week!
but i expected it to tank the whole time because i havent been following news about the chinese investment AT ALL. so i didnt know.
But still happy i made some coin
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:17:14
At this stage 300 might be a long shot considering the amount of interest
4-500 seems sttonger technical  and psychological support
It might tank that low only if a big player dumps their coin like the both times the rsllies got killed
Or if the govt decides to regulate it hard
But Yeh I'm certainly Gunna keep an eye out

I would personally hold then sell some when it hit s a price you are happy with
But keep a bit you aren't afraid of losing for the super long haul
Bubbles tank eventually. It may not be from 800to 300 but from 2000 to 1000 who knows but it eventually will
Last time it bubbled to 260 ppl were calling it a short term bubble hype item.  One time pump and dump
This time there is genuine interest so I think long term it will keep running
