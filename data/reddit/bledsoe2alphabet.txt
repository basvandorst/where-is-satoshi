All this tether stuff is so weird. If it's a scam, don't put your money into it. This all feels like a weird attempt to spread FUD, but it's so easy to ignore because who cares? I hope FairX and better exchanges come along and grind Bitfinex into the dust and they're not even a thing a year from now.
Plus I don't know how many times people are going to have to be taught that if you are dumb money, just toss whatever you got at Bitcoin and check it every 3-4 months, and don't expect it to buy you a stupid ass sports car that you'll never use. Bitconnect, Tether, whatever, they'll learn eventually I guess.

It would impact the whole market if bitcoin cash suddenly went away, but sometimes these things are for the best.
The problem with Tether is that dumb people think they are buying fiat. I don't know if putting a band aid over Bitfinex's greed for taking advantage of stupid people is going to be good for the market long term. Short term? Yeah, we'll see some dips.

That's a massive jump to make. If you think cryptos could be worthless then I'm not sure why you ever engaged in the communities in the first place.
Smart money in crypto is attracted to the blockchain and who uses it the best. Using the blockchain for currency is a totally logical and innovative idea that has yet to be fully realized.

Less coins are available, it's not rocket science

Sure it did. It just doesn't have as far to fall.
