The post is probably prompted by this merged pull request from this morning:  -- the censorship of coinbase's service on bitcoin.org because of their bip101 support.

Ideally, sure. But considering how many people either don't know bitcoin exists or don't know anything about it (see: people who think that bitcoin went bankrupt), I don't think this is going to have much of an impact on Apple's bottom line anytime soon.

You only say that because you are looking at it from a consumer standpoint and only looking at its downsides. If you ran a website, there are several reasons why Java apps are good. It's relatively easy to program, powerful,  easy to deploy, and almost guaranteed to run on any computer fine.

Try guiminer. It's basically just a gui over cgminer. Some people don't like it (not enough fine tuning option control or some other random card-specific nonsense), but it might work for you since it only mines the cards which are explicitly selected.

Just because the donors live outside the US doesn't mean that Mozilla can just ignore donations from those people when doing their taxes.

Simply noticing it is enough. A lot of people who know about it hear bitcoin and think "the ponzi scheme? Didn't their ceo go bankrupt?" This would reinforce that it is legitimate and available.

Actually yes because that's vote brigading - a site wide reddit rule.

You don't. A paypal dispute is saying, "This seller is trying to scam me, I want my money back" - which is patently false if the only problem is USPS damaged your package. You're supposed to contact the seller directly so that they can file an insurance claim and send a replacement. 
@_date: 2016-11-16 01:47:30
You can dispute it with a 3rd party moderator in both cases. That virtually never needs to happen though because (assuming they wrapped it properly) it doesn't cost the seller anything but time to file an insurance claim and send you a new one. My point is that you almost never need to actually file a dispute because the vast majority of the time the seller is willing to communicate and work out a solution without the buyer starting the process to get a refund.

Ghostery is more effective. I know this source could be a bit biased, but it appears to be reliable:  Disconnect is popular because it is Open Source and cannot send user data back to a central server while Ghostery is proprietary and has a option to send analytics back to their servers (although it is opt-in).

For keyhunter, you need to run Linux. You can do this by booting a live version of ubuntu from USB. Not possible on windows because it needs to be able to read the drive as an unmounted file to read individual bytes, not as a directory. It's pretty easy if you haven't done it before, but don't hesitate to ask if you've got questions.

For me, it's because once you have the bitcoins, it has all the benefits of cash with no risk (assuming you properly password protect your wallet) and without needing to carry anything but your phone. You can not only pay any retailer who accepts bitcoins, but you can also just send them to anyone else with a smartphone just by scanning their qr code. Backup your private keys in a safe place, and now you can't lose your coins. There's a whole world of possiblities with the ability to immediately send any amount currency anywhere in the world for only a very nominal fee.

Bitlocker isn't available on Home Premium so unless you shelled out for windows ultimate it's not an option. If you do have it, bitlocker is fairly easy to use but it's strength is really its ease of deployment in a corporate or university setting since most of these computers will be running enterprise anyway. For an individual, truecrypt has a few more features such as being able to easily make encrypted file containers which imo give it a fair advantage over bitlocker.

You should be running the command like this (assuming python is in your PATH in windows): "python keyhunter.py C:/file" so you are correct there.   
The problem is you are using python 3 and it was written in python 2. The difference in syntax for the print command is:
Python2:  
     print 'print this'
Python3:  
     print('print this')
EDIT: I'm not really sure how this would work on windows. In linux, you would point it towards /dev/sdx to read a drive. AFAIK, there is no windows equivalent of this.

No, that's a smart business decision. Besides, if you were running a company and wanted to have a central place to store your revenue while still accepting currencies from around the world, it's feasible that you would take the euros/pounds/whatever and immediately turn them into usd instead of having 100 accounts for all possible currencies. How is bitcoin any different?
