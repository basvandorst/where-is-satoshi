She's just digging herself deeper into this mess. I would like to see her on bloomberg again to explain this post.

They haven't really made an update to their site since 2011. The new album comes out in May, so I'm guessing they would update their site and add a BTC option.

I am guessing that Apple will start allowing Bitcoin wallet apps once it is massively adopted. Right now it is in the early stages with only a few million users. If the majority of iPhone users demanded a Bitcoin wallet, then it would happen.

Looks too much like an S. However, I think it could be improved upon (maybe more diagonal positioning?).
also, the current Blockchain.info logo looks like shit.

I mainly don't like their logo when it is small and scaled down, it becomes very pixelated (too much detail)and just bad looking.
@_date: 2014-04-11 05:00:33
yep, confirmed: NOT FUNNY

"we" as in this subreddit of bitcoin enthusiasts, I never mentioned anything about the US flag. I am from Ukraine, so I obviously did not mean to offend anyone from outside the US. I think the meaning of my post was obvious (BITCOIN TO THE MOON!!).

Nope, the one from Saturday.

Your site looks great, just bookmarked it. Do you think you will ever sell the new Mac Pro?

As someone who lost coins on GOX, i hope they just partition these coins among the users :)
