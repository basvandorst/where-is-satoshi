I saw this piece a few minutes ago and read it. I'm not all tht familiar with the underlying technology, but ole Ezra really seems to be off in his understanding. What was up with the bit about bitcoin users paying bitcoin miners to use the product? That just doesn't sound quite right ....

and how did he get unbanned! (either he did that or was never ACTUALLY banned ...... MYSTERIES!!)

on what grounds ? they didnt smear him as far as im aware. it's really hard to sue a newspaper and win because they're generally pretty damn aware of the law.

i'm not saying she didnt cross a few boundaries i would have crossed. i always used to identify right up front as a reporter. idk that she trespassed. I think the walkway up to your door is considered public property, but im not sure. 
in any case, yeah, like i said, stheres lots wrong with journalism. But compiling information from publicly available information isnt one of them

i like this response. reddit is a clusterfuck of idiocy sometimes.

i dont get it. so was his brother the guy that invented bitcoin or not?

I get that you guys dont like 'doxing' people. and that makes sense. Online witch hunts, which really amount to an angry, ill-informed mob, are pretty ridiculous. Journalists, however, are trained in how to properly use public records to find information. This is a STAPLE of the journalism establishment. And keep in mind, if they didnt know how to do these things, you wouldnt have important investigative stories that have kept government in check over the years.
i was a journalist for more than 5 years. Sure there's a lot wrong with journalism, but using public records to accurately identify someone is hardly one of them. And I guarantee that if someone used the same methods to do the same to her, she would respect their rights to investigate public records.

I dont know. During my time as a reporter it seems they didnt bat an eye at talking to the paper's lawyer. newspapers are viciously protective of their right to the free press.

LOL good luck with that. I don't think this is going to be a successful lawsuit, and anybody donating is likely just wasting money. But go ahead folks. lawyers need to eat too!

confusion and stress arent grounds for a lawsuit bud. in fact, i think it's pretty safe to say that the majority of news articles written cause "confusion and stress" on a number of subjects.

damn son. lost a fortune :'(

it's really not that weird if you think about it. it's a new technology and people want to know about it. The best way to do that for people who are not as technically savvy is to ask someone who is. Sure, be smart about what exactly you reveal. But it's honestly not surprising at all. It's a complex technology

or a shit load of money

same. thing. here.
waiting for another something to happen, like somebody permanently loses thousands, then watch price fall, then maybe try to get in.

No wonder he died. Bitcoins are digital things. No nutritional value =\
but seriously, that sucks :( he's probably much better off now. Kudos to the outpost for helping him out

You can tell it's a scam because it's using the old Google logo
