The article addresses this question of yours: "It's just worthless?"




Beyond that, I'm reluctant to summarize the whole article because it lays out such a well-structured argument for the quoted conclusion.

Thank you. TIL the word "contango".
If I can ask one more question: Do you know if any of the consultants involved in the CBOE/CME bitcoin futures appreciated that Bitcoin has negligible storage cost?
For anyone else still reading, here's a good article explaining the arbitrage principle above as it applies to crude oil:  ("Brent" refers to North Sea crude oil, which is used as a benchmark.)
The system is not sustainable without the "storage cost" variable. (Which, I get now, was essentially your initial point.)

I'm not saying the error's generated by the browser.
But code on the server can misbehave because of something sent to it by the browser. E.g. A poorly coded guard condition against the existence of a cookie, or format of a param.

If the split goes ahead, and you have bitcoin in a paper wallet at that time, then you'll be able to claim the equivalent coins on the new chain.


As I understand it, they also plan to distribute the 980,000 early coins that Satoshi mined and has never moved. Why they think that's a good idea is anyone's guess. (So much for the immutability of your blockchain.)
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:30:34
I agree with your basic point. 2 quick notes though:


Centralization doesn't imply regulation. Either can happen without the other. And AFAIK, the devs care less about censorship/regulation than about security, by way of trustlessness. 
Even a regulated block chain can be secure. But a centralized crypto currency losses its trustlessness, regardless of any regulations. If we can't believe the blockchain, then bitcoin has even less utility than "a horribly inefficient version of paypal".


This isn't possible with bitcoin, by definition. Were you referring to double-spending?

Not really ELI5, but: 
A miner chooses which transactions to include in each block he mines, thereby "confirming" the transactions. The size of Bitcoin's blocks is limited. If there are more transactions in the queue than space in the block, some transactions won't get included until the next block is mined.
You specify the fee for each transaction in Bitcoin. Miners typically care most about the $$$ they can earn, so when filling their blocks, they'll choose the transactions with the highest fees attached to them. When there's no transaction backlog, you can specify a small fee, and the miner will still add your transaction because even a small fee is better than nothing. But if the backlog grows, you'll have to outbid the fees attached to other transaction to ensure the miner picks yours.
Unless you don't need the transaction to confirm quickly, in which case you can still use a low fee and just wait for a miner to pick it up.
In other words, a backlog of transactions typically leads to higher fees and longer transaction confirmation times.

If you believe it's a different version, then [Satoshi's and Gavin's words]( should also convince you that it's an attack
Satoshi: " ... a second implementation would be a menace to the network."
Gavin: "SOMEBODY will try to mess up the network (or co-opt it for their own use) sooner or later.  They'll either hack the existing code or write **their own version**, and will be a menace to the network."

Thanks for the thorough comment. I struggle with one aspect, and I apologize in advance if this comes across as antagonistic. I'm asking sincerely:
You acknowledge mining power as a central threat. Do you not accept the premise (as points out above) that larger blocks will put centralization pressure on miners?
Or have you tacitly acknowledged that fact, and dismissed it as irrelevant because "mining power tends to be centralized in places like China"? (I.e. no point worrying about it if it's already happening anyway.)
Again, not asking a loaded question. I struggle with justifications too, but this one genuinely worries me and you seem to have discounted it. I'm curious as to why.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:32:47
Here's a decent ELI5: 
There's chatter about it recently because two real-world exchanges (CME and CBOE) announced plans to start selling bitcoin futures, starting on monday for the CBOE. Speculation is that large bitcoin holders/traders ("whales") will buy contracts on the price of bitcoin falling. That way, if the price does fall, they make money on the "short" side, and if it keeps rising, they make money off their BTC holdings. 
Depending on market sentiment, this might actually *cause* the price to fall. Or rise. Or neither/both/something else/whoknowsnotme

A few high level points not touched on by others:


He's conflating blocksize with blocksize limit. The "blocksize debate" is about the latter, he's arguing about the former.




He neither describes "this system" nor the "outcome". His argument here is an appeal to emotion that rests on people's general wariness and distrust of banks. If you share that sentiment, you'll find yourself agreeing with him even though he hasn't actually made a point!
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:15:57


Two different things. The economic risk of mining an orphan exists independent of operational costs. External costs only amplify its magnitude.
Decent data here, if you haven't seen it: 
Basically, as block sizes have grown, we're seeing more orphan races due to propagation time.

Unrestricted access to modern technology is a basic tenet of democracy, and so not a given across the globe. Even if a restriction is artificial (e.g. the local doctator doesn't like crypto), I think we should always be mindful of the unintended consequences that technological restrictions can cause. And tying the network to "modern" hardware in some way would definitely be such a restriction.
