And here's the start of yet another period of Mt Gox being alive, after all these fuckups including this big one. I was hoping it would die this time, but already redditors have jumped ship to somewhat support Mt Gox. 
This will surely do the Bitcoin protocol good in the long run, right? With all these media channels reporting on the flaws of Bitcoin simply because that stupid Mt Gox is fucking up YET AGAIN? Now we all know better than to listen to these biassed media channels but even so, wouldn't we be better of painted in a positive rather than negative picture?
@_date: 2014-02-08 10:53:02
Wrong. This is exactly what happens IF it's regulated. 
Bitcoin will never be regulated, for the good of it. If it does happen, if the software gets altered that allows for centralization, then it's a simple matter of jumping ship to the next cryptocurrency. 
People chose Bitcoin because it's decentralized and unregulated. And it's one of the most popular valuta of the planet now. 
The issue with MtGox is one of trust and one of convenience regarding conversion to dollars. The individual owners of wallets chose to host their money at some company instead of keeping it for themselves. They have to blame themselves since Bitcoin was never intended for central agencies to keep track of your money. You might as well just give $22,000 to a random stranger and expect to get it back some day.
The death of MtGox will be used by the media to discredit Bitcoin as a whole, because either they don't understand Bitcoin at all and consider it a valuta with one central bank, or because - likely in order of the respective governments - they intentionally want to discredit Bitcoin because it's part of a movement towards individuality, something greatly disliked by some very powerful organisations. 
But to those who aren't stupid enough to fall for the propaganda, the death of MtGox will only further emphasize the essence of a decentralized valuta, because centralization will lead to catastrophes like this.

No, I can't really be far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like, because MtGox stole my Bitcoins.

I agree. Except for the part where HE IS responsible for not returning his CLIENTS MONEY. 
Usually, this is called theft. Or would that also be my fault?
Edit: Ah, such a mature reply.

The exception confirms the rule. And you just posted the exception.
@_date: 2014-02-18 14:06:49
Absolutely. But we gotta make sure we attack them on ALL fronts. People are already buying into their bullshit press statements, indirectly blaming the protocol/others for their own mistakes. I prefer Mt. Gox to die this time, the entire Bitcoin community would be better off. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 21:57:58
Agreed, but I'm actually afraid the money still left on MtGox isn't going back to the owners.

Yes, but the entire point of Bitcoin is to NOT act like a bank. The point is to hoard money 'under your mattress', to keep your own money to yourself, without some regulatory organisation keeping your money to do stuff with it behind your knowledge - I prefer not to have another Mt. Gox accident. I prefer not to have my money loaned out. I prefer not to have yet another system of loans, taxes, etc etc that the current 'stable' main valuta have. With Bitcoin, debt does not exist. 
I prefer the negative effects of the free market over the negative effects of a regulated market. I believe the free market has much more to offer than a regulated one. If you're so worried about thiefs, and you're using Bitcoin, then you must also have the knowledge to protect your wallet. Bank robberies don't exist with Bitcoin unless you use a bank of some kind or someone specifically targets your wallet, as a real life burglar can steal your physical wallet. 
I doubt you're alone with that opinion, and I fully understand where it came from, but when you look at it, Bitcoin isn't all that bad - besides, you don't have to use Bitcoin if you don't trust it. That's nice about it, it's fully optional, in contrary to your national valuta. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 21:08:29

@_date: 2014-02-25 16:17:23
Yes, it could be. Either way, MtGox is dead and our coins are gone. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 13:46:31


Hahaha yeah no. It'll still take a while before the mainstream adopts it. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 20:34:17




Yeah sorry but it doesn't work that way. People paid for their expensive iPhones to - among other things - use Bitcoin apps as well. Apple isn't just blocking an app, it's blocking the ability of people to pay. 
If people aren't allowed to complain to the PRIVATE COMPANY the purchased something from, then the world would look quite different. Some laws were created because of complaints about shady practices by PRIVATE COMPANIES.
Funny how CAPITALIZING WORDS works, too.
@_date: 2014-02-10 14:13:01
Mt. Gox officially going that way?
Very well. Fuck you, Mt. Gox.

This argument doesn't hold even if I (or anyone else) DID know of such risk. Mt. Gox is a bad exchange to use, agreed. But that doesn't make it OUR fault that THEY fuck up.

Absolutely. But what about those who purchased their products to use with bitcoin apps? They're the ones truly hurt, not those who haven't purchased them yet. Those people now are stuck with a costly device and may not get an equally powerful Android or Windows Phone or Godzilla Thunderfuck in return.

Or - crazy idea - *some* people should go out from under their rocks and do some reading about Mt. Gox's latest failures!
@_date: 2014-02-11 16:51:16
Just pretend it is close to zero. With every major bitcoin outlet moving against MtGox, it won't be long before it's finally dead.
I'm getting popcorn.

"MtGox must not die because that single corrupt company can otherwise ruin the entirety of the Bitcoin protocol!"
Yeah, there's 2 problems here. One, you're saying MtGox shouldn't die while it has done everything to deserve it, and two, you're pointing out a major flaw in Bitcoin, namely that the stability of the coin may depend on a single corrupt player.
This only further reinforces the need for decentralized valuta, and further proves that central agencies such as exchanges are dangerous.
Then again, unpopular opinion here: Bitcoin shouldn't be used for exchanges, but as a valuta to pay stuff with. If it's just used to buy low, sell high, - or to get regular valuta with it in that way, yeah, no wonder it's going to suck. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 14:18:52
That's the smile of someone who is depressed inside. The man is not happy/thrilled, but very much disappointed to the point it even amazes him how badly he and everyone who has money at MtGox have been treated by this asshole and his company, or what's left of it. 
I feel really sorry for everyone who have stored Bitcoins there, but I'm glad it's going to collapse. If only Mark would get arrested for theft..
@_date: 2014-02-08 20:28:06
Editorialized title. Mt. Gox is not dead. It's dead when it's dead, not when you think it's dead or if you think it's heading towards death quickly. It's not dead yet, so don't pretend it is. 
Tl;dr: op is a phony

Cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin or no Bitcoin, will live on. I'm actually really eager to see the currency used for Bitcloud, when that project goes live. I have a feeling that currency might overtake Bitcoin or at least be a vial competitor. 
Edit: I'm not sure what the coin will be, but it's going to be the reward revenue for providing bandwidth to the network, so I reckon it has to have some actual value. Namecoin has a value too, right?
@_date: 2014-02-14 14:27:40
Those were just the major fuckups of MtGox. You betcha there are many more undocumented fuckups there.

I'll keep from bashing on Bing with this one; as I believe less popular certainly doesn't make a search engine worse. Okay I kid, I won't skip on Bing: That still sucks but for other reasons than not being as popular as Google. It rather goes the other way around: The better a search engine, the more likely it's popular.
Anyway, there are search engines - duckduckgo, for example, that certainly aren't bad at all for their popularity ranking. Bitcoin, as you said, is a perfect example when comparing valuta.

And what about the people inbetween those numbers, the ones who didn't get convicted for tax crimes but had to pay up one way or another otherwise? 
That said, this still confirms that the government is going after you if you ignore their laws. And there is yet to be an argument that actually shows how the people are in charge instead of the government, other than "we mark a circle every 2 years for red or blue". 
@_date: 2014-02-10 23:47:10


No need to turn this around, playing the "you go" game. You stated:


You made a claim about Libertarianism which others don't seem to agree with. It's up to you to explain yourself as to why you believe in this association with Libertarianism. Given that you respond in this manner rather than simply give a brief description of what you consider to be Libertarianism makes it appear as if you don't really know what it is; seek to intentionally discredit Libertarianism as a whole; or both.

No, it's because they tend to not want the fines. If they see pathways to launder money without getting caught, they will utilize them. They follow the money, not the oh-so-holy rule of law. Catching them is the exception, because they're good at what they do - not because they're happy to follow the rules that would make them less money.

Which is also a problem with Bitcoin itself. How could a valuta be so destabilized by one rogue player? That goes completely against the spirit of Bitcoin, yet it keeps happening.

Isn't it unhealthy to treat Bitcoin merely as a "buy now sell later" valuta for the sakes of making a profit? Isn't it better to, you know, USE Bitcoin to buy stuff?
