Youre not getting the point. Dogecoin IS DIRECTLY RELATED to bitcoin.  If dogecoin is getting publicity, Bitcoin receives a margin of that as byproduct.  It also shows that if dogecoin is getting air time, we need to push bitcoin to do the same.

The coin is out of focus more than the phone.  I understand its a phone, but you should be careful of that.
@_date: 2014-07-24 21:32:51
You didnt answer the question, was it in this format? It's like a facebook esque chat location now.
@_date: 2014-02-11 00:11:02
short answer, no one knows. until gox corrects itself. 
And everyone else, quit saying there is no "correct price".  Yes we all realize that practically bitcoin has no "value" (notice the quotations), however the current price is artificially caused by gox goxxing up.

hey theyve earned my service. I like them a good amount.
@_date: 2014-05-22 06:55:30
here we go

I'm being more careful with coins on cb, if I have more than a few coins I will withdraw them.  I don't buy anymore than I can lose.

It was just a casual chat of me messaging "luke", saying I hope coin base doesn't gox me, to which he replies in a friendly manner with an emoticon. The response time was under 30 seconds. 
@_date: 2014-07-25 05:32:08
Thanks that's the reply I was looking for.  I was near positive I had never seen that there before so it was strange.
@_date: 2014-02-11 00:08:16
ill downvote the other guy and explain it out as far as i understand it.  
Mt.Gox is currently preventing withdrawals due to a glitch in the system which can be read more in depth [here](
This caused Mt.Gox to panic slightly and pause all withdrawals until it can be fixed.
With all withdrawals paused, people are generally scared (as I am myself) that there is a slight chance we may not get our money OUT of gox.  This made it VERY unlikely for others to want to invest more in gox's market, ergo the price fell.  When gox's price fell, so did everyone else's, since gox holds such a large stand in the market.
I however have no clue about dwolla, if I never heard about that incident.
Hope that helps.

RemindMe! one year
@_date: 2014-07-24 21:07:47
Has it? I checked it recently, perhaps a week ago, and did not notice it.  Was it in another location on the site?  Now it is in a convenient and discreet box in the bottom right corner.
@_date: 2014-07-24 20:24:45
How so?
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:44:04
haha i just realized you were circle jerkin'.  well played, you outsmarted me.

putting bluetooth into a credit card is, again, ridiculously expensive to produce.  and you would need a smartphone around always. this is a much simpler idea, just a nice looking card with a number.
if you're ideas are so easy, try making them yourself.
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:49:22
wow thank you! i was so confused, i reinstalled my drivers and everything.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:36:04
well with this level of volatility, jumping hundreds in a day and hundreds in seconds, anything can happen
@_date: 2013-05-02 02:00:05
how exactly do you expect to accomplish this?  We can flood this sub with posts everyone agrees on "Let's get Apple to accept Bitcoin!"  "Let's get Obama to accept Bitcoin!"  It won't get anything done.
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:53:43
Oh hey, quick question so i don't have to clog of the sub with another post, when I'm mining and get an actual amount of bitcoins, how would i get it to my account or somewhere safe?
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:12:02
hah my heart jumped when i saw i had made about $100,000 for nothing. I thought I left some laptop burning away in a remote building or something.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:26:03
wouldn't it be dandy if they all went through.. 100k like that.. *sigh*
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:53:22
kept telling myself it had to be a glitch and not to get my hopes up, but damn were my hopes up.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:35:04
lol nope still crashing. glad i was smart not greedy and didnt buy in with the *$1000* hopes.  i have half my worth in bitcoins half in dollars, so im happy whichever direction it goes as long as it goes hard
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:30:53
hey look it's coming back
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:33:43
what if it rebounds hard, just as everyone tries to sell out ;)
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:24:19
it's this sort of panic that's causing the crash you idiot.  Hold on, it will crash and if you weren't an idiot and didn't invest your life savings you'll be fine.  Wait until it levels out, and watch as it climbs back up.
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:49:41
that's so weird, didn't know they had codenames.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:31:38
i trusted it, and kept rock solid the whole way
