Any suggested reading? I’m not trying to take on traders with 100 years of experience, that would be asinine. I have however surprised myself and actually find this stuff pretty fascinating. 
Also I do appreciate your input, however the devil’s in the details...I’m looking for something to sink my teeth into.

So these are my ideas, and I’ll probably repost in tomorrow’s daily...
Major market manipulation by big money who is threatened by bitcoin.  This would perhaps be followed by a company (such as Amazon) releasing their own block chain technology that the average joe would feel more comfortable investing in. 
The bubble pops? But that would just be a big correction...it seems there are enough people buying internationally to redistribute the funds. Perhaps people just take losses and move to another crypto (LTC, Monero?)
Honestly I don’t know.

Yea I’d be surprised to see 400k at any point in my life so I’m not too worried about that but thanks for your recommendation!

I have a dream of owning .7 bitcoin... right now I'm at .03759
Andreas talks are eye opening, I'm very grateful that we have somebody as well versed as him. Also what intrigues me about the major media is so far I haven't seen a nay-sayer who holistically understands the technology. Everybody who's against it seems to have a warped/incomplete perception. Is there anybody here who has a solid understanding willing to play devils advocate as to how bitcoin can fail? I'm curious to see if I'm missing any possible major downfalls.

New to reddit or alt account?

Which I understand in concept. How would these professionals steamroll the young people in the game. Manipulating the market with big money?
I saw sale orders accumulating almost 1300 BTC @ $17250 about half an hour ago on GDAX (biggest I’ve seen this week) was that perhaps what this is, or maybe just someone trying to cash out?

Just what a shill would say.

Ever heard of tongue-in-cheek?

This dude sounds like a shill...not saying he is...
