Ah I see, I will copy and paste the text transaction from now on. I was not aware what you guys have on your end since users don't get to see what's recorded.
Good job on it all to provide an outlet for my bitcoins.

I have the same problem. Happened November 30th. One deposit did not show up and two refund did not happen. 2 emails with screen caps as well as a Twitter message already sent to foldapp and didn't hear back. 
I thought it went gox and just stopped using it.

The loan scenario is fine, because Bitcoin is fully convertible to other currencies. So in case of not having enough Bitcoin to pay back the lender, you can always convert real world currencies.
Remember that Bitcoin is a compliment to real world currency and not meant as a replacement. If it is a replacement, you can watch the FBI swooping down on every miner this moment to shut it down.
With that statement made, let's look at the Keynesian argument that a currency needs to always inflate otherwise all hell breaks loose.
Look at the total monetary supply as your economy. We have $100 at the beginning of the year, if the whole economy lends out money to itself at 10% interest and the loan is due next year. What needs to be paid back in a year? $110. However, without inflating/printing the money, where do you find that extra $10 to pay back? This creates defaults because whoever is left with paying that final $10 back has to pay infinite amount of money to do so. They default and wipes out more than the $10 value in the whole economy. 
I can see the Keynesian end game as a problem, if bitcoin becomes more than the US economy and loans are made in bitcoins while non currency is convertible into bitcoins. 
But this scenario will take a lot longer to play out and requires all country's consent to use it. We'll figure something out once we get there.
