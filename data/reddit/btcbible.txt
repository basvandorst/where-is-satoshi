Definitely a good reason. Earning income in BTC isn't for everyone, especially those with large fiat obligations such as mortgages, children, etc. Bitcoin is way to risky at the moment to accept as income if you have any of these responsibilities.
But if you're single, rent a cheap apartment, and have no kids, then earning income in BTC can be an incredibly awesome savings vehicle; especially if you live below your means. You just need to make sure to cash out enough at pay day to handle fiat bills/obligations.

I don't know if it's even possible, but it would neat to be able to send a variable amount of BTC (sum amount specified in fiat) to a multi-sig/escrow account that could then adjust for current market fiat price (based on a specified exchange) at the time of payout. Does that make any sense?

I approved this job based on its level of detail and legitimate appearance, but I cannot actually confirm its validity.

I like to think of it as "owning" a certain amount of *spent* computer resources; the bitcoin in my wallet was created by miners' processing power which has already been spent, so the bitcoin represents some *very* small fraction of the total hashing power of the bitcoin network at the time that the specific bitcoin was created.
I don't know if its technically accurate, but that's how I look at it. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.

You're probably not a good fit for Coinbase, but I'm also going to go out on a limb and say that the average bitcoin consumer doesn't average more than 10 BTC/week. Even if I'm wrong, there's a bigger issue at stake here. That, my bit-rich friend, is a rare trait in the money-handling industry known as transparency. The openness and responsiveness exhibited by Coinbase distinguishes them from any other "bank" I know of. And don't forget that Coinbase is essentially fronting bitcoin for instant purchases, which exposes them to big banking risks. So be grateful, ya brat!
Plus, their customer service extends to Reddit....c'mon!
