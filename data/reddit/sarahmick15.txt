Yeah I’ve been preaching HODL, but also told them that as completely new to this at these prices, even using it as a low risk (read: investing a small amount) to a potential 5-10x return is fun and something totally new to learn about!

Sure, some folks will see the difference. Point is, she had never heard of BCH, and seeing the word “Bitcoin” just means BTC to her. It’s already been stated to death, but it’s beyond confusing and media is using the confusion to fuel clickbait.

Strictly a Thunder drinker, solely by accident. Must be some kind of idiot. Definitely not an an average consumer being played by age old marketing/media tactics psychologically proven to impact customers.

Seems like a lot of folks are wanting it to go back down to $3k-$5k range to buy. Reading these threads is making me nervous as my methodology is to hold for more of a long term gain. I️m pretty sure we won’t see $3k again.

I should note that I double and triple checked that this was not from my wallet, this was a purchase straight from my bank, and not a cheapside credit card purchase. Seems to truly have been an alternate version of the buy screens. I also realize I could have been a tester if they plan to roll this out, but a tester for 1 hour? I work in apps and it has me like ��

Nothing lovelier than a dip to buy in and a lovely pic of Leo.
