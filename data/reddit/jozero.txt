The idling is the wasting of energy, which happens all the time if your “sudoku” solution doesn’t match the artificially set approval criteria

And a car idling is merely a delay in the car getting you somewhere. Pollution is merely a by product of producing something we all want, etc. This excuse is too simple, it could be applied to any “the ends justify the means” production.  Destroying rain forests is good because it got us the mineral that let me play puzzle quest on my phone. 
It’s a built inefficiency of that system, just because something works like that to make it all work doesn’t make it a positive. 
And it is a waste. Otherwise you wouldn’t have a push to go to proof of stake.

The energy isn’t wasted? Like energy was used, it’s not like it gets to recycle the energy on the next attempt.

Fair enough on the PoS, I should of said alternative methods
In context of traditional economics your definition makes sense, but it’s the same don’t factor in externalities into the calculation of your production that is destroying the planet. It doesn’t make it right or correct. 
The analogy make sense for current realities. In the future an electric car idles but produces no waste, we still know what the analogy is saying. Same with bitcoin mining waste, sure in some future that same work might use a fraction of the energy, but who cares

So what happens when a bitcoin rig solves for a block that doesn’t match the approval criteria set? It is repeatedly calculating a hash that meets the criteria ( ex. Number of leading zeroes in the hash ) which wastes tremendous amount of energy.
