Forget displaying the remaining bitcoins to be mined, you should have one of these:
Or it’s big brother:

I’m sure this is true for some alt coins, but it’s very easy to look at the trading volume and see what the coins are actually doing and how many hands are involved.  I think it’s much more likely that a lot of people are treating the alts like penny stocks and with popularity the volume has increased.  That doesn’t mean we won’t see lots of corrections in 2018, we most certainly will.

How does your math change if segwit and batched transactions is used?

This is why I always keep records of my tracking numbers.

I like the music in your video, do you have any music available online to purchase?  Follow up question - do you accept crypto?
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:08:17
Well handled!

December 2017 was the time to sell BTC, it peaked mid month at ATH and then took a nose dive, continuing to decline through all of 2018.  December was absolutely the worst time to buy, and every year since has followed suit.
@_date: 2019-12-17 06:45:21
Not to mention historically December is always a bad month for crypto.

People have less disposable income dec-april.  January is almost always a month of decline followed by more decline in February.  Better to wait for things to bottom out for a while, avoid the crypto winter.

There’s plenty of people working in the private sector that don’t do much work either.  I work on corporate and government projects and they’re different animals, but neither is efficient.  Once an organization grows beyond a certain size, efficiency takes a back seat to dominance.  This is true of governments, corporations, and armies.  Yes waste can sink the ship, but capitalism isn’t about efficiency, it’s about controlling resources.

I sold a little back at $300 thinking it would correct and I would buy again when it came back to $150....

It was mentioned already, but seriously guys did you expect Heineken to require their distributors and dealers to accept bitcoin or they'd stop shipping them product?  Are you crazy?
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:25:16
It's like every week or so we get a 20-30% off sale

How about moving your assets into foreign exchanges and speculating on them during times of volatility, and then moving the bitcoins to us exchanges when you need usd?  
There's no rule saying you have to keep your bitcoins on us exchanges

I keep an encrypted disk image on drop box, it contains my wallet.  Both have very strong passwords.  I'm paying the $3 a month for unlimited dropbox backup retrieval.
Is this a bad idea?
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:05:39
I sold some at $300 thinking it had to correct down, I wanted to buy then.  From then until now, my coins have been free and the price has done nothing but go up.  So now that I have money back in, I can only assume it's going to tank.  Such is my luck.
@_date: 2013-10-25 16:57:55
The disk image is encrypted.

It can't be very secure if it accepts that monopoly money that you put in

What's something awful?

"Mr. Enzi's Marketplace Fairness Act discriminates against Internet-based businesses by imposing burdens that it does not apply to brick-and-mortar companies. For the first time, online merchants would be forced to collect sales taxes for all of America's estimated 9,600 state and local taxing authorities."
But brick and mortar stores have been having to collect sales tax for years while Internet sites do not, at the expense of local business and local tax revenue.

I was hoping it would actually crash so I could buy a ton
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:11:34
Doing it.  Next time I sell I'll be buying a house.

Can we just call them Micros?  Sounds like the future to me.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:50:48
Still waiting for it to come down to a reasonable price so I can buy more
@_date: 2013-11-12 03:03:44
Could I get one sent too?  insolace
