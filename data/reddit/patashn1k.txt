Things like this make me realise how little I truly know about bitcoin. Is having the seed written down for recovery enough, or is it necessary to back up wallet.dat too?

Hm, I was considering buying one to bridge the gap between GPU-ASIC (at this rate, there's no knowing if or when I could be using one), but doesn't seem likely now. A friend did link me to some small-time manufacturer of FPGAs (I forget the address now), but most were sold out or not for sale - makes sense, given what you've said.

I better take this opportunity to rephrase a question I asked in a post yesterday, which wasn't popular. Given the unboxing and test run video by a third party, does it look like the Jalapeño might be legit after all, or is BFL still nowhere near being in the clear? Is there a similarly-priced ASIC being provided by another, trustworthy, company? I could just wait and see if the actual orders ever make it, but I imagine I should acquire an ASIC sooner rather than later. I already mine casually, so it's not about moving into mining, but moving on from GPU mining.

I'm already into mining, but just casually, using an old HD 6870 - not much, but enough to make a nice sum during a bubble a few weeks back.
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:22:29
I average about 260Mhash/s with the HD 6870, so a 7970 sounds like a compromise. Thanks for the tip.

That's a classic ignorant human response when people realise they're missing out on something they don't understand. I'm not saying your parents are necessarily ignorant - I don't know them - but it's like when the elderly complain about technology's pervasiveness in modern society, while having no idea just how beneficial it is, or how much they inadvertently rely on it. Even if the bitcoin community wasn't elitist, the general population would make it so simply by marginalising it.

I started using bitbargain after dabbling with other services. It has no fees (the lovely folks running it just ask for donations), users are alerted via SMS for deals, and countdowns mean you can trade bitcoin for GBP via bank transfer in a minute. Sorry if I sound like I'm selling the service, but surely there's an equivalent service in the US?

Thanks for the tip, but I'm just not convinced about the numbers - we're talking about the market months from now. I do realise that I'm late and won't be riding the crest of the early ASICs shaking things up, but it looks like I'd be getting one eventually anyway. Although, you two don't sound very sure about getting one at all - are you suggesting that it might not be at all worth getting a "weaker" model this late?
@_date: 2013-04-22 14:27:10
I figured the price rise was explained by the increase in hash rate, power consumption and actual size. The "somewhat legit" comes from the video shared yesterday of an unboxing and test run - yeah, with some stretch of the imagination it could be an elaborate hoax, and we can't be 100% sure until Joe Q. Public has his own order in his hands. I am still sceptical of BFL, but I'm not going to stay sceptical if the situation changes. The precise reason I posted here was because I'm unsure.

That's what I was worried about. I knew about Avalon, but their single unit - although the company seems trusted by the community - is well beyond my means. I recently came across ASICMINER too, but they just rent usage instead of selling units, right? I suppose I'll count my blessings and be satisfied that I'm still making coins at all these days.

I wasn't expecting to make a side income out of it, just a decent enough return. Do you mean buying an ASIC partly for the good of the network, kind of like keeping a client running supposedly does? As you've probably noticed, the more technical aspects go right over my head.
@_date: 2013-04-21 18:59:27
As far as we can trust BFL, the current expected shipping date is July (would be later for me, being overseas and knowing customs delays) for orders made now. Not that we *can* trust them, but at least one guy has a working machine (unless he's part of some conspiracy, depending on who you ask). I read that difficulty was expected to skyrocket before the summer, but it's not been too bad as far as I've seen. I'm by no means an expert, but it seems that a lot of the estimates are rather up in the air.
I thought the surge of ASICs would mean that you'd have a much wider profit margin early on, but even after a large migration, even a few Ghash/s is worthwhile... but please correct me if I'm wrong.

Isn't reddit known for its circlejerk tradition?

I seem to remember starting with qt, but I use Electrum now.

Hm, because companies never break the law for profit.

Peer reviews and communities built on trust work around that. If you get learned and stay alert, you can pretty much altogether avoid scams. The only problem I've had with bitcoins (other than Gox's dreadful rates) was when I didn't understand the process of an exchange and lost a coin because of it. I'm only somewhere in the middle, being his parents' tech support for everything while not understanding all the intricacies, so to my mind, a lot comes down to common sense (which was what drew me to bitcoins in the first place).
Like I said, I'm just a young padawan learner, so someone please correct me if I'm wrong.
Edit: wouldn't you call community trust its own rather libertarian sort of regulation?

I can build a desktop rig, but playing with raw chips... I think I'll pass.
@_date: 2013-04-21 22:17:43
Well, the other folks haven't given me much confidence, but ASICs seem like the only route if I want to continue mining (which I do).
Edit: helping develop the network wouldn't hurt either, of course!
@_date: 2013-04-22 14:50:36
I'm not as experienced as the other folks around here, but I've been using coins for six months, and less securely than you do. I don't use online wallet services, just the usual encrypted wallet in a desktop client, and I buy and sell often enough so that I never have a large amount held anywhere, just in case. Besides one misunderstanding on a local bitcoin trade site, I've yet to have a single problem with the currency. I can't say the same for GBP in the same amount of time...

As someone else has already pointed out, no one chooses to be born. We can be grateful for our our life situation and our parents having provided for us, but just getting by in life - especially when you no longer have your parents' support - is its own challenge. The way I see it, a child "pays back" their upbringing by supporting their parents in old age - it seems more meaningful to me than false gratitude.
I digress... I've yet to tell my old folks about coins. My father is in finance, after all, but it's hard enough trying to explain networking to the guy, let alone crypto-currency.
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:47:39
I must've mixed them up with some other renting service. (I meant renting out hash rates, not physical machines. Hosting is probably the better word.) Those do look rather cute, as far as these things go... could this be an alternative to the Jalapeño?
