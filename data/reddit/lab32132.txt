Dude if they really had 1.6billion dollars in liquid fiat, they would have hired a professional audit company to verify and attest to this, and then had a massive fucking press conference with hookers and free cocaine to announce this. These guys are marketing pros and if there was any chance this operation is legit, they would have announced it in grand fashion to kill the FUD once and for all. 
The reason they are dragging their feet, not serving US customers, moving their operations out of the US and pretending to be setting up audits by unknown companies from third world companies is because this is certainly a scam. 
It's a scam that props up the price of BTC and makes sure it rebounds every time there's a major dip, so a lot in the community are not going to be interested in calling this out. 
It's like when there's a rotting deep cyst in your face, you'd rather apply some mild topical ointment and makeup and hope it just goes away eventually, rather than taking a heated blade and cutting out this cyst so a full clean recovery can be made. If a doctor suggested cutting it out, you might even lash out at the doc. That's the situation we are in right now. 
But eventually it's going to pop. And it's not going to be an isolated event like the BitConnect pop, it's going to be possibly push us into bear market territory for a long long time.

Oh boy. You really think there's 650billion dollars of fiat that has been exchanged into crypto? Market cap is the last sold price * number of coins in circulation. For an exponentially growing asset, this means there can be a very large market cap backed a very small circulating pool of fiat. 
This is why a whale selling off 10million dollars worth of BTC quickly can trigger a massive selloff. This is why usdt can shore up the bitcoin price by pumping in 100-200million dollars after every 'crash'.

The vast majority of that is between crypto. Fiat to crypto is much much less.

Noob here, how do you think BTC can collapse after the futures market goes live today?
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:01:13
"as low as 18k"
Nigga BTC was below 18k just two days back. Stop having these unrealistic expectations, that's what's going to cause a ridiculous bubble.

Can't access GDAX, how many more sell orders are there at 19k?
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:02:36
Noob question, if the futures are in fiat, how is it going to affect bitcoin price?
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:54:46
You've got the name sorted, so I guess all the heavy lifting is done.
