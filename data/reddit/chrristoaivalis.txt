And a government(s) (GASP) to enforce the validity of the decision made, something bitcoin could have used, eh?

But the whole point of bitcoin is to eschew government intervention. Its seems like you want regulation and state legitimacy only when the crypto currency fails.

The irony of using state apparati to recoup losses on a market system ideologically opposed to government intervention is delicious.

It might not mean as much as people would like it to mean. But it does mean something. remember, Bitcoin is supposed to be money, not a stock. If it was a stock, then perhaps yes, you should go in knowing that your spends your money, and you takes your chances. 
In Canada, my money at a bank is insured by the state up to one hundred thousand dollars. If the bank goes under, I still get my money. If Bitcoin goes under, what do you get? 
Basically the equivalent of Reddit Silver.

Banks have government regulatory systems and public insurance backing them. Bitcoin has neither.

The canadian government insures bank accounts. Since the government of Canada via the Bank of Canada produces our currency, its clear that in some cases, the currency backed by a government provides more stability. 
It may provide less freedom, but look what capitalistic freedom has wrought here.

Bulllshit. The solution is a universal income, along with the end of profit-centered banking and credit.

seems like some regulation would have been warranted.
