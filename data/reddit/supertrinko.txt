Why do you say it isn't right before getting the answers to your questions?

If that were true why isn't every billionaire and their dog dumping their fortunes into Bitcoin and just waiting for the value to inevitably rise?
Because that's not how it works and there are no guarantees.

In NZ it's free, unless I use another bank's ATM, then it's a 50c fee. Though I'm with the biggest bank with the most ATMs so not really an issue. And I hardly ever need an ATM anyway.

It's more pointing out how groups suddenly go quiet while others start speaking up.
It means that the face of the sub changes.

Before your comment, it was just a comment on a lottery ticket, only your Sherlockian deduction skills were adept enough to deduce that it was a Breaking Bad reference. I doubt anyone else alive could pick up on that without first watching the show. And because no one else would be able to, really you, the spoilee, became the spoiler! If I had a dramatic chipmunk gif, I would be posting it here.

Then what made you mention Breaking Bad in reply to that particular comment?
@_date: 2013-10-08 16:30:14
That's quite a stretch. And I expect, by replying to it and mentioning Breaking Bad, other people would not have the same thought pattern as you and assume you had already seen Breaking Bad. And really, by replying, you're asking for a spoiler, and in effect, spoiling it for others.
