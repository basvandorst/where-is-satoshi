Yup was on Eligius a few months back but then joined ghash when it had HALF the hash rate it has now! incredible growth.

I see this kind of requirement (expectation) failing miserably.

I was originally mining on a much smaller pool however the owner shut it down due to a number of reasons. At that time I tried Eligius but discovered Ghash.io did % payouts to different addresses, which made my time managing my coins for people who invested with me a lot easier. Over the xmas period I had this on set and forget I hadn't actively been monitoring their growth until the last day. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 04:15:10
Tried today? Most businesses were closed over xmas break.

Ah good i thought we nearly made it 24 hours without 'China' banning bitcoin....*phew*

It is possible the bank is only cracking down on non-business accounts who have not provided additional AML information (or have a documented business relationship with the bank). The customer quoted in the article appears to be trading very large amounts of BTC/fiat without any apparent business in place. 
Edit: yup looks like i'm wrong :( bugger

If it was purely used for money transfer what would give its value? Why would miners keep mining? 
Also they say banks could still charge a fee for "Banks might still charge a per-transaction fee for a Bitcoin-based wire system, since there would be costs associated with setting up the technology needed to make it happen securely" ....people should really understand the technology before writing articles on it.

Apologies this is for people with 'low'  (300-490) hashrate not &lt;10GH/s.

Looks dodge to me also...however, the ABN checks out
Entity name:	WEEXCHANGE AUSTRALIA PTY. LTD.
ABN status:	Active from 25 Oct 2011
Entity type:	Australian Private Company
Goods &amp; Services Tax (GST):	Not currently registered for GST
Main business location:	WA 6163
Entity name	From	To
WEEXCHANGE AUSTRALIA PTY. LTD.	25 Oct 2011	(current)

Street view of the registered address however does not look promising.

As with every other thread asking this, expect difficulty to skyrocket by Q3 as BFL get their deliveries in full swing and Avalon DIY chips start pumping out some massive figures. 
Imo GPU mining will be dead by end of the year (unless you have free electricity) and ASIC will be the new 'norm' and its entry price will drop to meet the market after the initial pioneers.  
@_date: 2013-10-25 23:05:41
Guys please try running enable_cores, then restart, give it about 10-15 minutes, then from within SSH (or gui) restart CGMiner. This for me gives best results. 
Also give 0.97 a good 10-12 hours before deciding if it is performing. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:18:07
Bought coin last night, processed within an hour.
Deposited AUD online and via branch both appeared within 12 hours.
I spoke to the guys yesterday and they apologised for the delays and they are hiring more staff to handle the volume.
Call them if you have any concerns, their great to chat to also. 
 Phone number there.

Why would anyone offer below market rates for the extra hassle? You pay a premium to do this type of transaction not a discount.

Yeah unfortunately i find doing it online is quicker...no idea why both times i walked into NAB ive had to wait until the next morning. Online it hits their account 3AM next day. 
@_date: 2013-05-05 09:49:08
Anyone have any idea why their insistence on depositing in person rather than just a simple online direct deposit? There is 0 recourse in both methods so I do not see the risk unless i'm missing something obvious.
It seems rather antiquated to buy a digital currency you must physically visit a bank...

scam? Haven't heard much about this crew on bitcointalk or anywhere else, the video looks rather sketchy and shows mainly the web interface which could just be a mock up. 
Anyone else got any info?

Hmm really? Didn't even know a direct deposit online could go 'pending', should check that out more!
Even if they waited until the deposit hit there side i'd prefer that over getting off my ass and going to the bank!

FYI 0.98 firmware has fixed the majority of these issues. Low has rate high error etc

+1 Coinjar.io , keep in mind their not an 'exchange' you cant sell BTC and keep the money in your Coinjar account it will deposit back to your bank account. 
I have done a couple sells / buys through them without any issues. Saves wires etc.

Coinjar.io (or Coinjar.com same site).
Very quick sign up process and validation (only required if depositing online). 2% fee for buying (based on their spot rate) and 1% for selling.
