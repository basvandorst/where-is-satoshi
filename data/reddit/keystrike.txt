In addition to the other comments, more users using tor means tor is more secure and its use becomes more normal. So by the time you need to use tor it is a bit more robust.

I guess it would be far too risky, but how about bundling the tor binary with Core, or having the installer give an option to download and install it (verifying signatures along the way)? Probably both are not good ideas. I just hate to see this great feature not being used. The HS uses almost no CPU/memory/bandwidth compared to a full node.

You won't be running a relay node so there are no bandwidth drawbacks. Here is more info: 
Basically your node will have an .onion address so it is reachable on the tor network. That is all. But this makes the bitcoin p2p network a bit more robust and secure.

But when you run the HS then you connect to tor relays in order to form the introduction point so passive network monitoring shows that. Doesn't matter though, tor is very widely used and will be more so in the future.

This is a new minor version release, including the BIP9, BIP68 and BIP112 softfork, various bugfixes and updated translations.
Binaries not yet available as of 2016-04-08!
 Downgrade to a version &lt; 0.12.0
Because release 0.12.0 and later will obfuscate the chainstate on every
fresh sync or reindex, the chainstate is not backwards-compatible with
pre-0.12 versions of Bitcoin Core or other software.
If you want to downgrade after you have done a reindex with 0.12.0 or later,
you will need to reindex when you first start Bitcoin Core version 0.11 or
Notable changes
First version bits BIP9 softfork deployment
This release includes a soft fork deployment to enforce [BIP68][],
[BIP112][] and [BIP113][] using the [BIP9][] deployment mechanism.
The deployment sets the block version number to 0x20000001 between
midnight 1st May 2016 and midnight 1st May 2017 to signal readiness for 
deployment. The version number consists of 0x20000000 to indicate version
bits together with setting bit 0 to indicate support for this combined
deployment, shown as "csv" in the `getblockchaininfo` RPC call.

[BIP112]: 
BIP68 soft fork to enforce sequence locks for relative locktime
[BIP68][] introduces relative lock-time consensus-enforced semantics of
the sequence number field to enable a signed transaction input to remain
invalid for a defined period of time after confirmation of its corresponding
For more information about the implementation, see
BIP112 soft fork to enforce OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY
[BIP112][] redefines the existing OP_NOP3 as OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY (CSV)
for a new opcode in the Bitcoin scripting system that in combination with
[BIP68][] allows execution pathways of a script to be restricted based
on the age of the output being spent.
For more information about the implementation, see
BIP113 locktime enforcement soft fork
Bitcoin Core 0.11.2 previously introduced mempool-only locktime
enforcement using GetMedianTimePast(). This release seeks to
consensus enforce the rule.
Bitcoin transactions currently may specify a locktime indicating when
they may be added to a valid block.  Current consensus rules require
that blocks have a block header time greater than the locktime specified
in any transaction in that block.
Miners get to choose what time they use for their header time, with the
consensus rule being that no node will accept a block whose time is more
than two hours in the future.  This creates a incentive for miners to
set their header times to future values in order to include locktimed
transactions which weren't supposed to be included for up to two more
The consensus rules also specify that valid blocks may have a header
time greater than that of the median of the 11 previous blocks.  This
GetMedianTimePast() time has a key feature we generally associate with
time: it can't go backwards.
[BIP113][] specifies a soft fork enforced in this release that
weakens this perverse incentive for individual miners to use a future
time by requiring that valid blocks have a computed GetMedianTimePast()
greater than the locktime specified in any transaction in that block.
Mempool inclusion rules currently require transactions to be valid for
immediate inclusion in a block in order to be accepted into the mempool.
This release begins applying the BIP113 rule to received transactions,
so transaction whose time is greater than the GetMedianTimePast() will
no longer be accepted into the mempool.
**Implication for miners:** you will begin rejecting transactions that
would not be valid under BIP113, which will prevent you from producing
invalid blocks when BIP113 is enforced on the network. Any
transactions which are valid under the current rules but not yet valid
under the BIP113 rules will either be mined by other miners or delayed
until they are valid under BIP113. Note, however, that time-based
locktime transactions are more or less unseen on the network currently.
**Implication for users:** GetMedianTimePast() always trails behind the
current time, so a transaction locktime set to the present time will be
rejected by nodes running this release until the median time moves
forward. To compensate, subtract one hour (3,600 seconds) from your
locktimes to allow those transactions to be included in mempools at
approximately the expected time.

Looks to me like this version will be finalized soon, almost definitely this month. May 1st is the first day the network can soft fork the BIP changes.
Keep in mind:
* Dates with an asterisk are when we expect to release soft fork-ready code. The code will not be released until it has been well reviewed, and the actual fork will take time to activate (BIP66 activated in July 2015 after a few months; BIP65 activated in Dec 2015 after only 5 weeks).

Sure, in a way, miners who break established rules are not really miners. Not bitcoin miners anyway.

Oh yea, I read a nice USENIX paper over the last year on how the deep packet inspection system works in the GFW to send spoofed TCP RST packets and drop the connections. The neat part was that they were even able to estimate the number or timing of processes/threads/queues running in the GFW's cluster by playing with TTL values and some other packet properties, but I forget the details. Point being that there is more than a bit of cat and mouse going on between Tor and China. Hence the development of circumvention measures at the application layer (sort of like you did with the SSH tunnel) which aim to shape traffic to look like other non-restricted protocols. This can be made versatile through pluggable transports. There has been cool research which makes Tor traffic look like Skype video calls. So the GFW can be tricked into thinking it recognizes the traffic as Skype but really it is Tor. Arms races like these can last a long time.
Example: 
A Polymorphic Network Protocol to Circumvent Censorship
But the CCP is quite powerful. If you have time I wonder what success you would have with some of Tor's obfuscation measures there.

Yea, so there is the metadata which we can disregard -- the key creation date, as that is provided by the user. The article points this out.
But the keys also come with a field of metadata which is the "preferred hashing algorithm". New versions of GnuPG added a few new SHA-2 algos and dropped RIPEMD160. Satoshi's "well known key" used an older version of GnuPG as the key contains metadata showing that it prefers these older hashing algorithms. The key from the articles was supposedly created within one day of the other key, but it's hashing algos are from a GnuPG that came out much later (I forget exactly when this code was branched in but perhaps ~1 year later).

Hi Gwern,
There are various pieces of meta-data which can be used for determining the time of key generation. The timestamp as you said is set by the user so it is not valid. However, different versions of GnuPG specify different hashing algorithm preferences. The "well known key" has a different set of these preferences specified despite the fact that it was generated within one day of the key from the article. The latter's hashing algos were not branched into the code until some time afterwards.
Later versions drop RIPEMD160 and add three additional SHA-2 algorithms. I think this sinks the theory.

Incorrect. This BIP uses the IsSuperMajority() system which uses a double threshold standard based on the previous 750 and 950 blocks. The new rules are now online (this is called "activation"). "Enforcement" will occur at 950/1000 -- at that time v3 are not allowed anymore. Future forks will likely do away with this bifurcated system as it is unnecessarily complex.

Either way, the organization has an incentive to use its social position to influence convention by controlling what people perceive as common/mutual knowledge.

His previous talk was great. One of the best ever. I think he must be taking this angle as regulators are going to insist on regulation so saying the rules already on the books are what apply is something that can possibly deter them from wasting everyone's time with more junk.

Apologies for the late reply, I was traveling in Uruguay for the last few days. I've been involved in bitcoin since before 2011 (you can see my bitcointalk user 'keystroke' with a post history from Feb. 2011), and I do not support any projects other than bitcoin itself. Believe me, I fully understand the protocol. :) Your allegations about my intentions are baseless speculation. I agree entirely with The_frozen_one's posts in this thread. I do not want any other currencies to use bitcoin's blockchain and I think alts are likely doomed to failure, as they should be.
From your post history it looks like you are a bitcoin supporter and not a troll so I am replying to you in good faith. You should calm down a bit as it seems you are angry with me. If you want to say that the word '(de)centralization' should be used only to refer to 'mining (de)centralization' because the word is so politically charged then that is one thing, which I can understand, but to incorrectly attribute motivations to me weakens this point.

People pay more for bandwidth and a cell plan. Average price would be much less of course -- I used a high number just to be super conservative for arguments sake.
@_date: 2016-03-24 11:39:25
Yea, it is positive. I don't know what about my title made it seem like I was trying to characterize it as a bad thing. I see what you mean about the overuse of the word decentralization, but it was not my intent to confuse. Having a few people control alert keys for the client which the majority of the network runs on amounts to a form of centralization and it's hard to fit much technical detail into short reddit topics.
@_date: 2015-01-08 20:39:53
The last line actually made me laugh!
@_date: 2016-03-19 23:01:50
Good question! There are additional threats even if we assume the code can't be altered. For instance, it is sort of like reinstalling a program every time you use it. The attacker has many tries to break the implementation because the server is always delivering the code to you -- and since javascript code can be modified (e.g. onmouseover) that means an audit of the code must extend beyond the javascript to all components.
So it comes back to having to trust the server to deliver you secure code. But the idea of this is that we were not supposed to have to trust the server in the first place.
Now if they have a browser plugin instead of javascript then that is a huge leap forward.

Right, the Nakamoto Institute site incorrectly lists Oct. 31, 2008 as the date of that one.
I can think of a few ways to verify it is the real one but don't want to say exactly how I would do it. One way would be to search for text which was only in that version and see if it appears anywhere on the web. Presumably it is already out there but hard to search for.

Definitely not my intention to spread disinformation. Please assume good faith rather than personally attacking me. :)
The fact is that allowing several privileged individuals, some of whom are anonymous, to send alerts to the primary client on the network amounts to centralization. I've been in  watching while the messages have been decided and signed by decree of a small group. That will now be in the past. That is good thing.
I am not sure why you emphasized part of the text. The -alertnotify option allows a user defined script to be executed when an alert happens, e.g. email script. These alerts are now only generated by the client's internals, for instance, when it sees a long fork. I repeat, this logic is internal to the client and not dependent on secret keys.
Implementation decentralization does exist for clients which do not make functional changes to consensus critical code. I do see your point about the word decentralization being generally overused.

Here's the paper and abstract.
Edit: Link was botched due to YT playlist, 
Abstract: Stratum, the de-facto mining communication
protocol used by blockchain based cryptocurrency systems,
enables miners to reliably and efficiently fetch jobs
from mining pool servers. In this paper we exploit Stratum’s
lack of encryption to develop passive and active
attacks on Bitcoin’s mining protocol, with important
implications on the privacy, security and even safety of
mining equipment owners. We introduce StraTap and
ISP Log attacks, that infer miner earnings if given access
to miner communications, or even their logs. We
develop BiteCoin, an active attack that hijacks shares
submitted by miners, and their associated payouts. We
build BiteCoin on WireGhost, a tool we developed to hijack
and surreptitiously maintain Stratum connections.
Our attacks reveal that securing Stratum through pervasive
encryption is not only undesirable (due to large
overheads), but also ineffective: an adversary can predict
miner earnings even when given access to only
packet timestamps. Instead, we devise Bedrock, a minimalistic
Stratum extension that protects the privacy
and security of mining participants. We introduce and
leverage the mining cookie concept, a secret that each
miner shares with the pool and includes in its puzzle
computations, and that prevents attackers from reconstructing
or hijacking the puzzles.
We have implemented our attacks and collected 138MB
of Stratum protocol traffic from mining equipment in
the US and Venezuela. We show that Bedrock is resilient
to active attacks even when an adversary breaks
the crypto constructs it uses. Bedrock imposes a daily
overhead of 12.03s on a single pool server that handles
mining traffic from 16,000 miners.

Just posting to make clear that these are DRAFT release notes only. My intent with this post was to get people excited about some of the lower level changes to Core that are often ignored here but take months of hard work to complete. I've followed the release notes issue on github and thought they were solid enough that public consumption would not be a problem at this point, but keep in mind that any of these notes can and will probably change.
I don't just celebrate lock-ins, activations, and new ATHs, but also new major version releases!
@_date: 2016-11-24 07:37:43
Will be interesting to see the bits of the alert key. :)
As this will coincide with the 0.14 release, here is the release schedule:
- Split off `0.14` branch from `master`
- Start RC cycle, tag and release `0.14.0rc1`
- Start merging for 0.15 on master branch
- Release 0.14.0 final (aim)

BTCC, AntPool, BitFury, Kano CKPool, and F2Pool are all in now and all have failed to signal support. :( That is around 50% hash power or so by my quick estimate.
Edit: Not FUD, I am sure some of them support segwit but need to get their signalling rolled out! And of course this is a long term vote and we can't know anything by looking at the first hour of what must take several weeks at a minimum. A bit disappointing as I had hoped to see the votes begin to roll in.
@_date: 2017-08-08 00:18:56
You guys do have a lot of unnecessary nonsense to deal with, sorry for accidentally increasing it! I like following work in progress (the TLS 1.3 spec is pretty interesting for instance, although that's a highly formalized process by comparison), so I'm used to things evolving, but perhaps you're right that Reddit isn't the place for drafts like this. I view as at least somewhat tech savvy, and certainly there are people here who are very much in the know when it comes to 0s and 1s. But I guess Bitcoin has grown enough now and the Reddit has become so contentious over time that it is best to practice some self-censorship when it comes to these things.
Still, it would be cool if new features were discussed here prior to release. A friend of mine was asking me about multiple wallet support and he didn't know it was planned for 0.15. All these features pop out seemingly at once and people aren't able to see what the plans are so easily. I think the weekly IRC meeting notes were perfect for that type of info/discussion but they haven't been published recently, which I think has been a great loss.
@_date: 2016-11-18 09:16:17
The version in hex will be 0x20000002. Some sites put it in decimal for some confusing reason so that would be 536,870,914. Latter is seen on bitcoinity and former is e.g. blockchain.info.

as well as updated translations.

How to Upgrade
If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on Mac)
or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).
The first time you run version 0.15.0 or newer, your chainstate database will be converted to a
new format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour,
depending on the speed of your machine.
Note that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no
automatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0 or higher. Upgrading
directly from 0.7.x and earlier without re-downloading the blockchain is not supported.
However, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.
Downgrading warning
- -------------------
Wallets created in 0.16 and later are not compatible with versions prior to 0.16
and will not work if you try to use newly created wallets in older versions. Existing
wallets that were created with older versions are not affected by this.
Bitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using
the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later. Windows XP is not supported.
Bitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
frequently tested on them.
Notable changes
Miner block size removed
- ------------------------
The `-blockmaxsize` option for miners to limit their blocks' sizes was
deprecated in version 0.15.1, and has now been removed. Miners should use the

Notable changes
RPC changes
The first positional argument of createrawtransaction was renamed. This interface change breaks compatibility with 0.14.0, when the named arguments functionality, introduced in 0.14.0, is used.
Getblocktemplate sets the segwit version bit even when the downstream client has not been updated to include the segwit commitment. Ability to enforce the rule is the only required criteria for safe activation, but previously signaling was only requested if the miner could include transactions in order to avoid a potential outcome where segwit would activate at a time when no segwit transactions could be included. Since many miners are now including the segwit commitment this concern no longer applies.

Bitcoin Core version 0.16.2 is now available for download. All users are encouraged to upgrade to this maintenance release that fixes several bugs and provides backports of new minor features, such as:
The verifytxoutproof RPC is no longer vulnerable to a particular expensive attack against SPV proofs publicly disclosed in early June. The attack was considered unlikely given that much cheaper attacks of roughly equal effectiveness are well known. Similarly, the getblock RPC also now returns extra information that can be used to defeat this attack even if the requested block has been pruned. None of this mitigates the attack for actual SPV clients.
The abandontransaction RPC has been fixed to abandon all descendant transactions, not just children. As before, you can call this RPC when you no longer want your wallet to re-broadcast an old unconfirmed transaction. Note that the RPC can not force miners or other nodes to forget about the transaction.
For a complete list of changes, please see the release notes. If have any questions, please stop by our IRC chatroom and we’ll do our best to help you.

I remember when zerohedge was on blogspot back in 2010. Used to read them every day for years. Then they ignored me when I went on IRC talking about bitcoin in '11-'12.
I learned a lot about the inner workings of the financial system but now they've turned into permabear doomer porn. Much better sites out there for macro analysis.

Halving has now moved up to July 23 UTC. I think a year ago it was scheduled for around July 31. But inflation rate is temporarily up slightly because of this as well. Lots of feedback loops in this beauty. Looks like the next difficulty will increase by 10%!

My bad, it will happen at block 350,000. So 19 more blocks to go.

Yea, very strange! JVP's story is inconsistent and I am now even more skeptical of it than I was before. I think he wanted it to be widely distributed and tried to make it sound secret to encourage this.
@_date: 2016-05-04 16:40:36
I heard about this story from JVP in Malla, Estonia in the summer of 2014. petertodd and fluffypony were there as well. At the time JVP wouldn't say where the conference was, but he described "walking down a path" which made it sound as though it was outside. Until now I haven't repeated this story as JVP told it in secrecy, although I imagined if he told us then he told others.
Last summer I saw a bitcoin documentary where Bernard von NotHaus was interviewed and he mentioned the conference was in 2005 in Europe (paraphrasing) so a quick Google returns the 'What the Hack' conference and this has been discussed on reddit quite recently.
Only thing is there is a YouTube of JVP appearing near CW on a panel. Great coincidence. I watched it closely some months ago and it doesn't appear as though there is any recognition there.
It all makes for a great story but my assumption is still that CW is a scammer until he presents us with some cryptographic proof.

Yea, come to think of it the WSJ has done some good pieces on BTC over the years, not to mention that two of their journalists wrote a positive book on cryptocurrency. I'll check them out more often. :)
@_date: 2015-11-23 05:34:09
From the article:
"It isn’t every day that University of Chicago economists Eugene Fama and Richard Thaler see eye to eye.  Fama, who won the Nobel Prize in 2013, is one of the best known proponents of the efficient market hypothesis.  Thaler, in contrast, champions behavioral economics.  Indeed, Thaler spends a great deal of time criticizing the efficient market hypothesis in his recent book, Misbehaving.
Both economists, however, seem to be on the same side when it comes to bitcoin.  Commenting on Fama’s recent interview with the Bitcoin Uncensored podcast, Thaler tweets: “Must say I agree with Fama here. Only value of bitcoin seems to be to crooks&amp;  [sic] tax cheats. Negative social value.”"
We must be doing something right if we can them to agree.

If signing with the genesis block doesn't prove something 100% then you also can't prove you own bitcoin 100%. Which is 100% false! Gavin, memorize the signature next time! ;)

Good question. How are you sure they are not the same people?

Congrats everyone on a very important release.
@_date: 2016-05-07 00:59:29
Yea, perhaps very likely in front of their own family as that is when the facade is also important. Everyone is a victim in this way, even CSW for all of his faults. It must suck to fail so publicly and the mob is fierce. Best to ignore such nonsensical claims for everyone's sake! That is why people invented cryptographic proofs.
I like how you point out that everyone knows this "soon" -- it's true! This is what has kept the human show on the road for all of this time. I wouldn't expect a species to survive this type of often fatally competitive environment without it. However this is seen as a pessimistic way of thinking about human nature so the Pollyannaish view prevails. But it can be best not to look too deeply into the abyss as we all know. ;)
@_date: 2016-05-07 00:50:47
Yea, just read the first half and skimmed through the second. He says he pointed him to Cypherpunks but CW posted in Cypherpunks back in the day and already knew about them I think. So the story doesn't add up as now the guy who wrote this originally says that CW was the guy he met here. Just doesn't add up at all.
@_date: 2016-05-05 12:54:51
Yes, but lots of human communication is about signalling. :)
@_date: 2016-05-03 00:56:33
lol, really? Pathetic.
@_date: 2016-05-05 14:22:58
Sure, it is possible! Could have been starting a creation myth or something like that. Definitely lolzable and I disregard his claims as he has no proof and now they have even changed over time. This whole story is not worth following but, as a friend said, it is like Agatha Christie for bitcoiners.
But CW did not prove anything to people so... unless you mean he incorrectly believed CW proved it and wanted to jump on board?
@_date: 2016-05-17 04:12:17
Great post, would down vote again
@_date: 2015-10-21 17:55:57
Illusion of legitimacy.
@_date: 2016-05-04 19:34:15
Yea, I have been thinking about that one for years and it is crazy that JVP now says CW is SN. I think these are huge clues. But it is strange JVP didn't think CW was SN back then, so barring cryptographic proof I think JVP just has a bad memory.
@_date: 2015-10-22 03:16:11
@_date: 2016-05-04 21:36:48
Sure, but did you see the details he remembered in : 
I'm half way through looking at that post but so far it fits well with the story I heard him tell in Malla.
@_date: 2016-05-06 18:50:58
Hey, I like that. The role info reminds me of Goffman's The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life. It's plausible too. We are all the stars of our own psychodramas!
@_date: 2016-10-25 22:30:24
Thanks for linking to the current version. I thought about your concern but figured I would post in the interest of giving people more current information; I don't think the draft will undergo any major changes. There aren't enough links to github here IMO and the notes are pretty exciting.
@_date: 2016-05-04 20:59:11
Ok but he was involved in bitcoin since 2009 so give him some credit.

Is this the first BIP which may be implemented using Version Bits? The BIP states, "The version number scheme is designed to be compatible with Pieter's Wuille's proposed "Version bits" BIP, and to not interfere with any other consensus rule changes in the process of being rolled out."
@_date: 2016-05-04 20:57:12
Yes, you're right, it is not clear that JVP can see CW.
@_date: 2016-05-06 12:34:56
I like it! Very plausible as it assumes a natural progression of things spiraling out of control rather than superhuman powers. He gox'd himself.
@_date: 2017-07-23 00:29:56
They just got another block, 477089. Strange, it has a witness commitment but doesn't signal segwit.
@_date: 2017-07-19 17:02:45
It sure is going to be close. Still waiting for the first slush block to signal BIP91.
@_date: 2016-05-05 14:28:49
I would be happy to actually engage in any constructive arguments but this baseless allegation I must ignore. If you were arguing in good faith you would acknowledge that you have failed to provide any proof for your previous claim -- which I did not say was false but I simply said it must be disregarded due to lack of proof. I did not state they were different or the same people, just that I cannot be certain either way.
@_date: 2017-07-23 08:18:34
Thanks! I guess you meant the above block.
@_date: 2016-05-05 14:20:37
No problem, I suspected you would say that, and it is fair not to out an old bitcoiner so I cannot argue with that. No reason to get defensive and it is not personal but then I must disregard your previous claim due to lack of proof. Not like it matters what I think anyway!
@_date: 2015-11-29 07:07:44
Cool! You're right. Back in the day when I didn't much of what they were saying I felt I got the most from reading ZeroHedge because they would go inside the system to stuff like TIC data (treasury international capital,  which I wouldn't find anywhere else. Or geeky stuff like compression algorithms for pushing quote data over a T1 (e.g. Nanex's analyses of order flow).
I should check out Bloomerg more. Of the other three I would put FT at the top, Economist second, and finally WSJ. I liked the Economist more before their change in editors back  circa '06 but they've just changed again so we will see how that goes. Either I became more radical or they became more  of a mouthpiece for the establishment under Micklethwait. :)
@_date: 2016-05-04 20:49:55
He seems to be the type of guy who would hold his honor above being paid to lie for no good reason.
@_date: 2015-03-31 12:12:26
Exactly. The government has no choice to steal what it cannot get by other means. It can't buy them without pushing the price up too much. So we can expect the government to try to steal bitcoin. And steal bitcoin it has done.

Lock-in threshold expected at ≈Tue, 08 Aug 2017 03:05:50 GMT.
@_date: 2016-05-04 12:01:53
Estonia, really?
It sure is an "interesting example" -- from Wikipedia:
"The Estonian Central bank refers to bitcoin as a "problematic scheme" and "Ponzi scheme".[55] The Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit stated that every person who exchanges any amount of bitcoin requires a license and that every person who trades more than 1000 Euro per months needs to be met in person and a copy of id made and kept.[56]"
@_date: 2016-05-04 20:47:36
Absolutely, that is a very good point. But he could now say that he knew it and didn't want to say anything beforehand for this very reason, which everyone would understand, rather than saying he now believes CW to be SN because he "got a better look at him" (paraphrasing as I don't have the exact tweet).
I'm glad this story is out as I've been waiting so long for it to be discussed publicly but didn't want to bring it out myself due to the privacy reasons mentioned above. Unfortunately people are being a bit too skeptical so they are going to miss this part of it for awhile until it gets boosted further into the light. Although, as I said above, it is ridiculous and very frustrating that we are dealing with cypherpunks here and cryptographic proof has not been forthcoming!

Looks like the main fix is a upnp library patch to prevent DoS / possible remote exploit.
