@_date: 2019-03-09 19:23:43
they aren't cheap.
@_date: 2019-03-19 00:55:27
More sanctions. ��
@_date: 2019-03-15 00:52:33
Here's the thing, in Bitcoins you atleast still hold some value if BTC crashes, but in betting you lose everything.
@_date: 2019-03-19 00:54:36
Thats why they have the most options available for buying/selling? Lol
@_date: 2019-03-15 01:04:06
Be careful with in person trades.
@_date: 2019-03-09 21:47:19
Someone that's from Poland seems mad.
@_date: 2019-03-19 00:48:02
Cashapp pretty sure
@_date: 2019-03-25 18:38:51
Yeah Facebook actually owns WhatsApp.
@_date: 2019-03-19 22:45:13
It's easy.
@_date: 2019-03-25 19:55:18
That wasn’t an example.
@_date: 2019-03-19 11:21:22
no need to cry for being a retard
@_date: 2019-03-10 11:54:26
I'm being currently scammed aswell, admins aren't doing shit.
@_date: 2019-03-09 18:47:21
Yeah loans are definitely free.
@_date: 2019-03-08 18:15:46
Banks dont ask for this shit ik lol
@_date: 2019-03-08 21:35:57
I don't need to make any judging, all these services are filled with pricks.
@_date: 2019-03-19 00:48:46
It isnt a scam lmao, you probably went on a phishing site.
@_date: 2019-03-24 02:14:19
Im guessing its gear s3
@_date: 2019-03-08 01:55:51
Revolut is the definition of money hungry, no support whatsoever, they keep saying new features will be added, they never do.
@_date: 2019-03-08 21:26:00
Yeah, that's selling bitcoins, this is buying.
@_date: 2019-08-25 12:14:15
You can rely it on though.
@_date: 2019-08-25 11:39:13
It’s not like a hacker is gonna search Minecraft for private keys lol
@_date: 2019-08-16 01:33:31
Between 1-9k.
@_date: 2019-08-25 06:27:54
Wouldn’t it be secure to put your private keys in a singleplayer world?
@_date: 2019-08-30 14:23:43
Easiest way is to not use it right?
@_date: 2019-10-19 22:04:28
Yeah, fuck gold. Lmao, give me a break.
@_date: 2019-06-08 16:45:24
India is banning everything, they might aswell ban leaving their country once you enter.
@_date: 2019-02-09 08:19:13
Brexit still hasn’t happened, no one knows what will happen to Monese/Revolut UK accs though.
@_date: 2019-02-04 04:56:59
That will never change.
@_date: 2019-02-13 14:52:26
That’s why you dont.... for fuck sake. Just dont trade with those bastards. Use ones that don’t require ID.
@_date: 2019-02-20 17:44:37
Lol.... Ahahahahaha 
@_date: 2019-02-07 19:46:19
UK - Monzo (takes 3-4mins to setup) gotta be a uk citizen
EU - Monese, Revolut (EU/UK)
@_date: 2019-06-08 10:26:19
Lol, this video was posted on reddit about 5-6months ago and had nothing to do with BTC.
@_date: 2019-04-12 20:38:57
@_date: 2019-04-26 17:39:18
Well, I do understand, but it's not possible to live in this world without fiat.
@_date: 2019-04-12 20:52:14
Keep thinking like what? I guaraante a millionaire won't care about $6k invested in Bitcoin, that's the entire point of  my post... I don't care if he's a millionaire, good for him, I'm just saying that no millionaire will care about losing $6k in Bitcoin.
And Warren Buffett, go easy on me, please.
@_date: 2019-04-05 00:16:30
These aren't scams, are mainly profit-dropship site, I just order off Aliexpress for $10, although last time I received a pink BTC shirt instead of Black... 
@_date: 2019-04-14 01:38:09
Goodluck with that.
@_date: 2019-04-12 00:18:43
People believe what they wanna believe.
@_date: 2019-04-02 22:04:49
Well, like the guy above said, if you bought a good altcoin it doesn't matter. People saying that all other altcoins are scams/crap are full of shit. Bitcoin can't compete with Ripple's instant confirmation and 0.0001xrp fee lol.
@_date: 2019-04-12 18:22:39
He implies that the guy is a millionaire, he doesn't need anything lol but if someone that has only 6k and invests 6k and loses it all, welp he has nothing.
@_date: 2019-04-12 20:23:36
Yeah, no crap? I was saying he's a millionaire if he loses 6k, it won't matter for him.. I never said he made a million out of BTC.
@_date: 2019-04-11 20:57:06
Issued by Paysafe, nice, Paysafe owns Skrill so not suprising.
@_date: 2019-04-26 18:10:18
All drug dealers, whether they use BTC or not are idiots. BTC is on a public Blockchain for god's sake, it can be analyzed...
@_date: 2019-04-26 18:04:30
Why so edgy? Some people don't live in States where Bitcoin is widely accepted.
@_date: 2019-04-03 02:45:44
XRP just stands out to me, such fast transaction with little to no fees.
@_date: 2019-04-03 23:01:10
That's beautiful.
@_date: 2019-04-10 04:15:17
Bitpay offers Agc conversion no kyc
@_date: 2018-11-30 05:55:24
Not really, as everything with banks is traceable, therefore thats why these banks are losing their licenses.
@_date: 2019-01-09 19:24:40
Gemini? Clowns..
@_date: 2019-01-01 22:16:44












Also, they fail everytime/
@_date: 2019-01-04 20:17:45
Why did you delete his post on your subreddit then? 
@_date: 2019-01-05 13:51:46
@_date: 2019-01-04 20:24:17
Suspicious activity is depositing BTC?
@_date: 2019-01-04 23:13:12
I asked a simple question, I have no clue what you're answering to.
@_date: 2019-01-04 20:21:15
Not everyone wants to have an Reddit account, everything is shady if you think about it, if this had happened to you and you didn't have an Reddit account, you would just let the scummy fucking exchange have the money.
@_date: 2019-01-04 21:28:45
If he's accessing from same country, same location, what's the fucking problem? Unless he's changing his IP countrytocountry.
@_date: 2019-01-04 23:15:37
Do you expect the government to use Bitcoin? LMAO
@_date: 2019-01-02 23:47:03
Not an investor, just a moron.
@_date: 2019-01-04 20:26:51
What he is trying to say is Fuck Exchanges.
@_date: 2019-09-11 17:58:08
You find me one of those that has BTC2AGC with no verification and other such as PSN/XBL.
@_date: 2019-09-11 14:35:07
Yes, don't use a service that has made Bitcoin more popular and more usable.
@_date: 2019-05-28 02:46:00
Lol, why is it a scam? Cause it has 0 fees practically?
@_date: 2018-12-24 13:18:19
@_date: 2018-12-25 03:15:24
Wrong, BitPay doesn’t ask for SSN, been using BitPay to buy AGC for 4-5months... 
@_date: 2018-12-23 13:51:48
I never said that European Union = The Balkans... I only said that VISA should be usable anywhere....

Nice one.
@_date: 2018-12-22 01:45:27
Such a fucking dumb thing, Balkans are sanctioned, like what, if you have a VISA card you're  supposed to be able to use it fucking anywhere....
@_date: 2018-12-22 02:42:43
Never said it was a scam, was just wondering if it's possible for it to crash, although I feel it's very unlikely, I love Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-24 04:02:26
@_date: 2019-05-11 04:58:04
Lol, what do you mean? I just use BitPay cause it’s convenient.
@_date: 2019-05-18 22:06:10
Lol, you don't meet the person so you don't feel guilty LMFAO.
@_date: 2019-05-19 19:07:39
This is the way to look at Bitcoin, not at one which replaces banks. Banks are essential
@_date: 2018-12-23 11:24:44
Like it matters shithead, VISA is usable anywhere.
@_date: 2018-12-27 01:34:04
Use both, cryptos and fiat.
@_date: 2018-12-25 04:04:59
Well obviously for a card you’d need an SSN, i’m talking AGC.
@_date: 2018-12-27 03:23:14
My bad, thought you  had a coffee shop so you just wanted to setup crypto.
@_date: 2019-05-07 23:42:43
That's what happens when shitters control a country.
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:48:18
Yes, I know it isn't.
@_date: 2018-12-23 11:18:38
This only applies to exchange wallets right?
@_date: 2019-05-24 04:33:02
Yes, you have to take a selfie + passport.
@_date: 2018-12-25 02:59:43
BitPay wallet, nothing else.
@_date: 2018-12-20 20:26:57
Let’s get it.
