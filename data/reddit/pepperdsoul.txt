That my gut feeling. Any idea on how to explain to her how.. the woman obviously isn't the brightest bulb in the box. 
This would be her second scam and I tried to tell her that if they are asking for money to give her money its a scam, on top of the last lady "adopting" my mom as her "mom" and kept talking about this divorce. Like the first one was waaaaaaay fucked up.

Wait.. so she bought a "key" from "blockchain" (chan?), or a bitcoin ATM.. which from the sounds of it gave her some idea to the credibility. 
In a normal interaction is that the same key you're talking about? Or is that beyond what I need to know?

Yeah, my siblings and I are aware since her mom and dad are very elderly, one of us is footing the bill for 30 or 40 years after my dad dies :|

Uhh, how do you think I feel since its my mom and she's not giving any good details.. this is about the extent of what she has told me. 
I just want to help her see the light sooner than a couple more thousand later..

Honestly I want her to stop trying to mortgage the house for bitcoin schemes (lucky for me, her credit is in the tank so she cant do that) 
Telling her bitcoin scammers sell her data has her warded off for now of people approaching her for opportunities (that and threatening to delete facebook and her access to constant FB pictures of her grandkids after finding out about Scammer  at minimum bitcoin scammers via facebook are a significant issue for her) 
I know bitcoin is complicated, but I just need to know how a legitimate mining investment would work- or if it is even a thing. I can google them but I myself would not be able to tell a legitimate "mining" operation/site from an illegitimate one. Her cousin told her this morning that the 3k  wants is to transfer the money from china (yen, I assune) to USD and I think she said it was an ATF fee? I'd assume some sort of currancy exchange thing. Good news, she now wants to go home (shes been here two weeks) bad news is she wants to go home to gather up 3k ��
I know these are probably 99% a scam. But I can't get through to her how (walk like a duck, talk like a duck doesn't work with her) 
Edit: PS your posts have made me laugh. Like all things I have considered doing (like burning her check book) and I'm pretty sure the key would be like posting my debit card on reddit :) 
Still made me laugh- but I think I'm restricted from how often I can post

I think she was given the names and numbers of these people from her cousin. I can never get a clear answer out of her other than "&lt;cousin&gt; told me about this" 
The cousin is a real human being, my grandmother keeps in contact with him since he moved to the mid west. However on his integrity and finances I cannot attest personally. Only what he shows on facebook. 
I'll try and push her a little bit more to find out how she met both sets, and maybe express concern over her data being "sold" to other potential scammers.

I have yet to talk to my brother about if he's actually approving or if my mom is just taking his indifference to her stupidity as approval. I only know what she has said over the last two weeks shes been visiting me...   however she keeps saying something about talking to her cousin (who is rather well off and makes risky investments that as far as appearances pay off, I dont really *know* the man) 
My brother while he knows more about it than I do also has not invested time, money or energy in bitcoins. He considers it occasionally, but has never actually taken any risk with it. 
I wish this was fake, I wish my mom didnt fall for get rich quick schemes. Alas, welcome to dysfunctional families 101. I really apologize for not being able to give more info, I really I wish I had more details..

Hi, new, not really interested in bitcoin (that's my brothers territory) but I'm worried about my mom.. I'm not famillear with the jargon so bear with me.. 
She has "invested" in a "bitcoin mining" (pool?). This is the second one. The first was an obvious scam, lady said she was from RBS and "going through a divorce" my mom "invested" some money which somehow turned into 40k.. when my mom went to try and retrieve her money BOA and her long time local banks shut down her accounts because they assumed the money was from "drugs" or something.. so my mom started sending the "RBS" lady itunes cards and shit. 300$ at a time. When my mom said enough was enough, the lady began pressuring my aunt to lend my mom money and when she wouldn't began telling my mom my Aunt and all her kids had abandoned her. My mom caught on after that and told the Ben lady to shove it. 
So she invested in this other, which my bitcoin savvy brother approved.. she began with 50$ and it either turned into 1,700 or 17,000 not sure which. Now they aparently deposited her investment in a credit union which isn't far from where I live, and she bought a "bitcoin key" to get her money and they want to "charge her 3k" for taxes up front (not take 3k out of her profits like say, fiedility would do if I tapped my 401k early) 
They don't want her traveling to the bank to pull the money out cash and won't send her a check or deposit it into her account. 
What the hell is going on? How should this process typically work? Can anyone help me understand so I can help her :/ 
Edit: got a few answers! 
Scam  the woman contacted her through facebook. No mutual friends. I read her the riot act about accepting friend requests from people she doesn't know especially with having her grandkids pictures posted up there. Think MLM style "hey hon" message. 
Scam  she was given the info from her Cousin.
My brothers approval goes as far as her verbally telling him the companies, and him looking them up and them appearing legit. He has not endorsed this. 
Scam  lady contacted my mom this afternoon and is trying to "show my mom" her money is in a bank account or some shit. I told my mom she needs to make it clear to this woman she's not getting any money whatsoever.
 If you guys want more updates that's cool- but you all have been very helpful so far, many thanks. I may not be able to save her from Amway, but maaaaaybe we can save her from Bitcoin scams!
