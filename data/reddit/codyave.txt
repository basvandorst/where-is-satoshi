getting USD into a decentralized exchange is the holy grail of crypto. is correct, in-person cash trades or banking institutions are the only way to get USD in and out of cryptos.
mastercoin, nxt, bit shares, colored coins, open transactions, counterparty coin, ethereum, and ripple are very ambitious projects looking to create more financial options into bitcoin and alt-coins. who knows which ones will lead the market in the years to come? :P

**Most of the research and media coverage on virtual currencies has focused on Bitcoin. Are there other virtual currencies that we should be paying attention to? How do they differ from Bitcoin?**
*The most important distinction to make between different types of digital currencies—which are quite real, not “virtual”—is between decentralized and centralized currencies. Bitcoin is a decentralized currency and protocol because it allows transfers directly from one user to any other, effectuated by publishing transactions on the global public ledger known as the “blockchain.” Centralized currencies require an intermediary organization of some kind to effect transactions, record them, and confirm them.*
*The Bitcoin software is open source. Anyone can use it to start their own payment system or to make any other use of the protocol. Different versions of the Bitcoin protocol and software may have properties that make them more useful than Bitcoin in certain respects. Any of them that come into common use are worth paying attention to and encouraging.*
*Bitcoin is the current leader among decentralized currencies because of the strong network effects that exist in protocols and payment systems. If many people are using a protocol, it is more valuable to everyone, and many people are using Bitcoin. But other decentralized currencies based on the Bitcoin protocol are seeking and may find a welcome place in the digital currency arena.*
*Time and experience will tell how important and valuable alternative implementations of the Bitcoin protocol will be. There are and will be other decentralized currencies based on it, and perhaps in future on other protocols. There is plenty of room for innovation, and in the end multiple decentralized digital currencies may co-exist, each put to use for the purposes to which it is best suited.*

Newsweek ran an article saying that they found the inventor of the bitcoin protocol. Right now there's dozens of reporters at his house. He's denied the rumors, saying he hadn't heard about bitcoin till three weeks ago when his son mentioned that a reporter wanted to ask him about bitcoin.
This puts this man in a precarious position: people now know where he lives, what he drives, his full name, his telephone number, and that he possibly has the private keys controlling 1 million bitcoins (about $650 million). There's concern that some unsavory actors might try and steal those keys.
The link above is a website where it is to be presumed the actual bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto has made a public comment to exonerate Dorian Nakamoto from the public eye. All the attention on the real Satoshi Nakamoto is due to the fact that he went into hiding several years ago, and this is his first post since. 
As the top comment in this post implies, it's like Jesus has come back just to disprove accusations that some random dude is the true Messiah.

I'll do a quick (albeit poor) summary:
* Nxt: Javascript, proof-of-stake, pre-mined (Nxt exchanged at IPO for bitcoin, so not really pre-mined). Advantage: no mining rigs needed. Disadvantages: ?
* Ethereum: Goal is to become the Android operating system of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO/DAC). Protocol based on contracts, fees pay for scripts to be run on network. Turing-complete so that any programming language can be implemented. Advantage: universal appeal, unlimited cryptos can be created using ethereum network, your toaster is now a DAO. Disadvantages: Controversial IPO-funding, concerns of ethereum not scaling when demand rises.
* Mastercoin: Runs on top of bitcoin protocol ("metacoin"), contracts and new currencies can be created and backed by mastercoin value. Advantages: new blockchain not required, possibility of first-mover advantage over other decentralized exchanges like Nxt, Ethereum, Bitshares, etc. Disadvantages: meta-data bloats already-bloated blockchain disk space requirement, criticisms concerning IPO funding, confirmation time of ten minutes too slow for trading.

low fees and a secure store of value are its selling points. it is gold in an unbreakable safe rhat can be moved across the world in any value to whomever for negligible fees. no banks charging fees, scrutinizing your purchasing history, reporting suspicious activity, freezing accounts as they see fit. no need to ask anyone for permission to spend your money. preserving the value of your blood, sweat, and tears that are not confiscated to pay off the principle and interest of an unpayable debt to the federal reserve. it is cash, it is gold, it is email, and it is freedom.

great article, and thanks for adding to the conversation!
i can't help but see parallels with bitcoin, and one i see that is also getting an equal amount of attention is google fiber. both systems are modeled on providing a better, faster, cheaper service than its current providers. comcast and time warner cable have an enormous market share that appears all but waning due to some ingenuity on google's behalf; perhaps the same of the USD? 
that is, can bitcoin provide faster transaction times than current U.S. banking systems, less fees, and such an ease of use that my grandma can access her bitcoin wallet to buy her groceries every week? also, if bitcoin competes against U.S. banks, does that mean the banks will have to get competitive with their services (i.e., lower interest rates, friendlier customer service, expansion to poorer markets)? i'm curious to see how mainstream websites like reddit and its redditors react to bitcoin if and when it gains the approval of big-time players like amazon, google, paypal, and the like. could bitcoin hit the front page of reddit a year from now with people raving how its saved their business and allowed them to expand with ease to foreign markets?

I agree , an online pawn shop (using escrow) will provide a valuable service. I disagree on receiving instant payment considering it is not a brick-and-mortar shop. The item's value will need to be appraised before payment is sent.

**tl;dr nope. businesses run on native land cannot ignore applicable state and federal laws and regulations, a bitcoin exchange is not exempt.**
reservations are technically sovereign nations, but they are more like state-sanctioned territories. in some areas of the law, tribal councils can apply to a federal judge for special status with regards to regulating themselves on a local level. examples of successful cases include tribal police forces, religious use of schedule i substances, indian casinos, and relaxed taxes on commodities like alcohol, cigarettes, and fireworks.
these special statuses are able to be issued to natives because they are all legal enterprises on the federal level as well as in their respective states. a petition to operate a bitcoin exchange on native land would be just as onerous and expensive to run as it would be in new york and california because the exchange would need to fulfill all applicable aml/kyc, msb licensing laws, and find a bank willing to provide them with liquidity. 
the only benefit a bitcoin exchange run on native land offers is the opportunity to let the local tribal council be in control of operations. it would not be cheap to set up, and they could not be loosely goosey on federal regulations -- all relevant three-letter agencies would be on them so fast if they thought for an instant the exchange was trying to be sneaky.

[MasterCoin thread on bitcointalk.org](
Be forewarned, there is a nontrivial amount of users declaring dacoinminster's method of bootstrapping his MasterCoin project as rather scammish in nature. For instance, he has not released the source code, and has made it clear that he will finish work on the code once he's received sufficient investment. There is speculation that he could take the money and run without delivering on his promises. Perhaps some of the users in that thread have learned from their experience with Butterfly Labs and intend not to let others fall into the same learning curve.
In his defense, dacoinminster says this is part of the risk an investor must take if they believe the MasterCoin project will be successful. Also, he offers up his well-known reputation as escrow; should any future developments resonate throughout the Bitcoin community as MasterCoin being a legitimate scam, dacoinminster likely would be run out of town with Bitcoin-purchased torches and pitchforks. If nothing else, he has addressed these issues upfront and has appeared consistent and reasonable with his detractors.
Personally, I have no problem with dacoinminster's fundraising methods or his projected timelines. If a Bitcoin investor spends afternoons rooting for the small guy, then MasterCoin might be a worthwhile topic to explore.

smart phones have intrinsic value because they allow communication, internet connections, games, apps, camera function, music, and movies. disconnect them from tower coverage and an internet connection, and they lose a lot of value. 
in this sense, bitcoins *per se* have very little -- if any -- value on their own. when they represent ownership of a part of the bitcoin protocol (that provides a ton of useful features), then bitcoins gain lots of value.

Critics are correct: bitcoins do not have intrinsic value. However, the bitcoin protocol -- a globally distributed, decentralized, and publicly verifiable time-stamping ledger -- has just a wee bit of intrinsic value. This protocol gives coins their value.

fwiw i've followed mastercoin and invictus since august, save the past few weeks.
invictus is securing a blockchain protocol requiring minimal cost and parts so that 95% of users can feasibly mine with their average computer, while at the same time restricting users with high-end GPUs and ASICs from gaming the system. their advantage is strength in numbers: millions of average users versus thousands of users with specialized equipment. 
mastercoin devs assume the creation of a new blockchain is unnecessary, and they can add value to the bitcoin protocol.

bitcointalk has known issues regarding sockpuppets. there's speculation that some users are selling aged (six months or older) accounts in order to bypass spam filters. the only way of discouraging sockpuppets would be to charge users a nominal fee or require hashing power in order to reply to threads (viewing threads would still be available to all users).

**transcript** [starting 
Melissa: You have folks out there campaigning against the Fed. We do need them for some basic stuff, I would say. I mean, number one, standing behind the currency. You look at something like Bitcoin, you know which is the extreme example if you don't like the dollar, and you don't like what the Fed is doing, you really don't trust it, and you kind of try and go off the grid, and go Bitcoin, but maybe...
[John interrupts]
John: I bought some, and the price I'm happy to say just went up.
Melissa: But it fluctuates like crazy. It goes up, it goes down. I think people don't count on it for the long-term so it feels like we go back to a system where we were doing barter or something. Because if you can't count on a currency at least in some situation -- [John shakes his head] -- no? I'm crazy, I'm wrong? You gave me a look like I'm a crazy person.
John: Because you're saying the existence of the Central Bank, which is basically printing four trillion dollars, means you can count on the currency. You could just as say when the inflation hits, and we're [John holds up a Zimbabwe bank note] -- this is from Zimbabwe -- and we're coming out with the one hundred billion dollar bill...
Melissa [holding up a second Zimbabwe bank note]: I've got my hundred trillion. I like my hundred trillion rather than your hundred billion [sarcasm is strong between these two]. Are we going to have a hundred trillion here in the U.S. sometime soon?
John: I hope not.
Melissa: We're going to need it to pay for some of the things that we're doing.
John: What's the alternative? Competitive banking. Before -- like Canada -- before they copied us and got their own Fed, they had each [which] would issue a currency, and you could say, "Why would I trust that?" Well, the banks would have a balance sheet you could look at, they wouldn't print much more money than they could back up. And there was competition, you could spread your risk around. During the Depression, five thousand banks failed in the United States. No banks failed in Canada. It's not clear that we need a Fed. It used to be that only Ron Paul complained about this.
Melissa [reluctantly]: Yeah.
John: For my show on this, we had trouble finding people who wanted to come on and defend the Fed.
Melissa: Really?
John: Goulsbee [sp?] eventually came on.
Melissa: Well...
John: Most of the usual suspects we called said, "No, I don't really want to defend them."
Melissa: He's a usual suspect. He'll kind of show for that side in any part, but no, he's a good guy. Alright, thank you so much. Good stuff. Very provocative.

**Can I buy bitcoins with Paypal?**
It is possible to buy physical bitcoins with PayPal but it is otherwise difficult and/or expensive to do so for non-physical bitcoins, because of significant risk to the seller.
While it is possible to find an individual who wishes to sell Bitcoin to you via Paypal, (perhaps via  ) most exchanges do not allow funding through PayPal. This is due to repeated cases where someone pays for bitcoins with Paypal, receives their bitcoins, and then fraudulently complains to Paypal that they never received their purchase. PayPal often sides with the fraudulent buyer in this case, which means any seller needs to cover that risk with higher fees or refuse to accept PayPal altogether.
Buying Bitcoins from individuals this way is still possible, but requires the seller to have some trust that the buyer will not file a claim with PayPal to reverse the payment.

**Project FAQ**
* Isn't 25 - 50 BTC kinda alot for this Project? How do I know you're not just wanting Free Bitcoins?
well as we have seen in the last few days the bitcoin price continues it's wild swings. We felt that 50 was a good celing to insure that if the market price drops drasticly we'd still be able to get into the gear needed to start the Project without having to come back for additional financing efforts. Our first choice would be a KnC "Neptune" unit which is about 20 BTC however should BTC price drop to 300 USD it would require 50 BTC to obtain the same unit. Also should KnC sell out of these units by the time we recieve all needed financing we estimate it could be the same amount to achieve the same results. Should we recieve the funding to get started with lest then 50 BTC we plan to modify this Project page to reflect our funding success we are commited to full transparency.
* If you get 50 BTC how do we know you wont just sell them or just sell the ones you generate from mining?
The main Goal for this project is to see if Bitcoin can really stand up as a means of trade that can make a positive impact in economically struggling areas. It's easy to chuckle at bitcoin in areas like New York City, Los Angeles, Singapore and other major cities...but what can it do for one of the most economically devestated regions in America. Shannon County, where the Pine Ridge indian reservation is located, is the second poorest county in the US with average annual income being $6,286 (9.3 BTC) . The Goal of this Project is to see if Bitcoin can be deployed and used to not only stabalize a failing economy but to revive it. Charlie Shrem was on "Adam vs the man" and they talked about the power of Bitcoin to come into a country like Iran and save a economy. That was a real model for this, we wanted to try it and see what impact, if any, could be made.
* What about FinCen and State AML, MSB regulations wont they affect the project?
I have a MSB through FinCen currently and the fact that the project is within the borders of a federally recognised Sovereign nation FinCen and state authorities have no jurisdiction on tribal territory. This is good because we can provide a real world enviorment to see what bitcoin can do if it is openly embraced as a alternative to the USD as a primary means of exchange and commerce. It also provides a clean slate to determine what, if any regulations need to be formed to secure the industry. This Project does intend to comply with all Federal AML statutes in order to secure the integrety of the project.
* Several Years ago Native American Tribes Opened Casinos with the hopes it would build a failing economy how would Bitcoin have greater success ?
Well when tribes began opening tribal Casinos some did very good and still do good today (more or less). However casinos encompass only one main industry, Gaming, the Oyate Project seeks to explore ALL facets of Bitcoin from Mining to Merchant Acceptence. Bitcoin may not be a "end all" for resolving the worlds economically affected areas...but I feel it is a great place to start.

many people misunderstand the difference between bitoin currency &amp; bitcoin protocol. detractors will say bitcoins are created out of thin air and are not backed by anything. the implication of that statement is that the USD is superior because it is backed by declaration of the U.S. government. however, the argument that bitcoin *is* backed by something can be made: the bitcoin protocol. 
bitcoins are not worth much by themselves -- just lines of code on someone's computer. give these lines of code to users across the globe, and it starts to provide value. it does what no one has done before, and that is providing a decentralized, distributed, peer-to-peer, verifiable public ledger. this should be the emphasis of discussion by the media, and we know that won't happen anytime soon.
good luck with your presentation. :)

copy/paste rant from 
* *i like to think of the mastercoin protocol as a giant stock market (dow, nasdaq, s&amp;p) combined with craigslist, ebay, the forex market, offshore holdings of undeclared assets, paypal, e-toro, gambling platforms, betting platforms... ALL built into one platform. i think J.R. calls it mastercoin because these other markets acts as slaves to the combined platform. ambitious guy, i tells ya.
he's giving the finger to all regulated markets like the ones i mentioned above, and opening the doors to an unregulated platform where users can create any market they see fit. no mandated oversight, no predefined rules, no authoritative checks and balances. users settle into their own level of risk -- i think i'm rambling, sorry.*
* [meme to explain why mastercoin does what it do](
**COLOURED COINS**
similar ideas as mastercoin. i haven't researched coloured coins long enough to understand the difference between it and mastercoin.
BitShares is a direct competitor. They move slower than mastercoin because they are securing their own (unique, may I add) blockchain. Should they get momentum when they step out of beta, there might be no  stopping them.
