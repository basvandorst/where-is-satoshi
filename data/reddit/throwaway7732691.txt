Thanks for that! My nodes are in Buffalo USA, but from two different providers. It might be (semi-)local it seems...

My vps' were in Buffalo, USA, but from two different providers. It might be a local thing, but it could also be just 300 additional clients each connected to most full nodes, but not accepting incoming connections themselves. Would they show in those stats at all? Stats are listing only reachable nodes.

So that would make me a pimp? LOL

Tnx. I wonder how many connections there would be if you had no maxconnections limit. So only 6 of 15, interesting.

I noticed nothing strange in debug.log, it is not very verbose though. I can upload it if anybody is interested.

5000 bit
Thanks for running a node. I hope this works now!

Thanks, this was very generous! Specially for a throwaway account ;) I guess I will have to pay it forward...
You are in the same timezone... so it seems your connections happened a bit later? 
For me it also happened on Mon Sep  1 13:00:01 CEST 2014 when I had cca 160 connections but only 80 the hour after. No other instances in the last 2 weeks.

Usually there are about 100 connections with small variance, yesterday that number slowly rose to 400 and then dropped like a stone. It was the same on all three nodes, so i believe it was network wide phenomenon. I'm wondering why there is no talk about it.

That guide was posted at 16 UTC, 4 hours after the event.
