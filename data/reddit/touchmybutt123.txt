lets be honest, people would have created this pyramid scheme irregardless.  you probably live one of the cushiest life in the HISTORY of mankind and here you are having your little whinefest :/  its a shame you cant get sent back in time, really.  Id love it, take your vaccinations away and send you back.  see how ya like it.
please spare me with your ideas about how to run society.  I am 100% sure that if you were in charge there would be widespread devastation.  in fact, what are your qualifications to know how to run society, exactly?  what have you done that has given you the impression that you know how to run a 19 trillion dollar economy that supports over 300 million people over 4 million square miles, like the US?  must be quite the list.  please share.

why is it a shitty situation that a pyramid scheme didnt work out exactly right?
@_date: 2018-08-22 02:53:35
people like you are hilarious.  just accept that in the end, your shit is run and reliant on other humans.  you probably complain about how many laws there are and how long they are and in the next breath suggest how we need to have lemonade stands run by kid exemptions.  you realize that would be even more law right?  youre suggesting more complication, longer laws.  
you people are literally raging against reality ...  really weird and sad stuff.  i truly wish i could put you into some Syrians shoes or something.  totally sucks  I cant.
@_date: 2018-08-22 14:34:09
dont you actively hate BTC?  governments are just how we run society.  its who enacts societies rules.  obviously, there is no way to operate a society without government, you get that right?  so why would you be into something that undermines the government, and therefore society?  
i mean bitcoin sucks irregardless, but the idea that you would want to erodes societies control over itself is really dumb.
@_date: 2018-08-22 02:57:59
nailed it.  so you sent out a total of 0.00303408 BTC and they received 0.000023 BTC, correct?  sounds like a terrible system, but youre right.  you can send that amount of bitcoin .... i guess... technically... youre right.

Lots of obfuscation and weird ass phrases like "empower the individual".  Can you stay on point?  Werent you just bitching about people staying on point?  Information has never been more accessible than it is right now and thats a trend that has been constantly climbing since the human race got started.  Youre arguing against all of human history.  
And now youre arguing that your doomsday predictions are altruistic - 'oh i just care about this community' and not just insane, baseless, bullshit.  Talking to you is like running on a hamster wheel.

Thats a quote from you.  Knowledge has literally gotten more and more freely available throughout history.  And we live in a time now of the freest knowledge ever.  Literally ever.  And you say that kind of shit.  You are a monster dude.  Nothing you are saying makes any sense.  Enslave humanity, feudalism, blah blah bullshit.  You have no fucking clue how shitty feudalism was.  You are sitting in a comfy little chair typing on a computer where you laze away your days and bitching about ghosts and snipes, because you dont do shit most of the day.
Fuck the internet man.  Its not worth letting people like you get their voices out there.  You should be socially outcast and unheard just like it used to be.  Fuck.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:43:27
Im not insulting you, just pointing out facts.  Information and knowledge is literally soaked into every inch of our lives and in our pockets.  Wikipedia articles are passing through your body as radio waves *right fucking now*.  Citing a tech crunch article about how the knowledge availability that has been growing since we started fucking scrawling on cave walls, talking and invented scrolls and printing presses is going to downturn, is just so ignorant and short sighted I pity the people in your life who count on your judgement.
I find the shit I need to find every single say out of my fucking pocket.  What you are spouting is bullshit.  The only thing I agree with in that article, is that social media is a fucking plague, which I pointed out in my first post.  You are the result of that social media.  Noone needs to hear what you think about things.  I am sure your opinion is not respected in real life and therefore people do not have to hear it.  But the anonyimity of the internet grants you a platform, and thats a problem society has not faced so far.  You should be outcast and unheard but here you are talking to me.  And I would never willingly hear your thoughts in real life, due to the social boundaries so carefully constructed in society.
Humanity's knowledge is literally everywhere and accessible to anyone.  Theres no big bad guy.  If anything is drowning out peoples knowledge, its people, manifested nicely by social media. Which, again, I pointed out in my first post.
@_date: 2017-11-10 04:25:04
Again, a whole paragraph of nothing.  Are you disputing the fact that information is more widely available now than ever and thats been a constant trend since the dawn of man?  And you, some guy who probably is pretty ineffectual in life, is saying thats going to stop somehow? lol.  Really? 


@_date: 2018-11-02 22:28:19
I would not disagree with that.  However, due to the nature of proof of work it would be massively easier to do that with a centralized solution.  Do you agree?  And I would also posit that that is a minuscule set of customers doing very few payments to their family members in foreign countries that are not served by the existing system, compared to say a VISA or any bank or anything.  Do you agree?  In fact, I would say anyone transferring money via crypto to family members in some other country is probably doing it because its illegal, either in the origin country or the destination country.  Do you agree?
Trust me bro, I want every single motherfuckin person on this earth to kick back and watch a big screen TV and eat popcorn with me while there a giant fuckin grill roasting some sweet ass chicken in the backyard.  I want that.  Id love to just hang with ya'll.  But I have looked at crypto, and it aint that.  You are being sold some bullshit.
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:22:30
I believe block chain exists and I believe its pretty much useless.  Can you show me a working, economically contributing cryptocurrency providing goods or services that are not just retards trading tokens back and forth hoping to rip each other off?
And you just jump all over the place.  What about all the years other than 2008 that the government ran?  Those were pretty good huh?  
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:57:47
Uhhh I dont see anything about WalMart using blockchain.  Just that they are trying to develop something.
Blockchain is stupid.  Youre stupid.  Bitcoin is the dumbest, most naive shit in the world.  You cant possibly think a deflationary currency is a good idea.  You cant be that fucking stupid.
And you still havent answered.  What about all the years other than 2008 where government run fiat has been awesome for us?
@_date: 2018-03-16 06:37:46
damn your so close.  once you realize that blockchain is just a little less useful than our current databases and thats why noone uses it, you will be right there!  good roast of that guy though, seriously
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:40:05
whos this "guys" you are saying bye to?
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:13:53
RIGHT.  And all the times OTHER THAN 2008 were caused by the government.  What about all the years that werent 2008 bud?  Thats why I point out the success we are all currently enjoying.  Care to respond, you stupid motherfucker?
My qualifications are none. Common sense enough to spot pyramid schemes, which you seem to lack.  And I am not the one trying to re-write the monetary policy am I?  
And I highly doubt you have those qualifications and you actually believe in bitcoin or crypto or anything involving blockchain.  I mean, are you fucking serious?  And you support deflationary currency?  Are you.. are you serious?  No way.   I call bullshit.  You cant be that fuckin stupid.
@_date: 2018-03-12 23:12:25
No.  It isnt the only fiat.  Some people murder people.  They are not the only people.  Some cars catch on fire.  They are not the only cars.  Some plants are poisonous.  They are not the only plants.  You, again, have no point.
No.  I cant possibly muster the interest to read some stupid fucking article about walmart managing the food supply chain.  I literally dont fuckin care.  I am not in the food supply business.  Neither are all you people.  Youre just obsessed with your internet tokens.
And I said *f u n c t i o n i n g*, do you know that that word means?  Give me the functioning one, thanks.
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:17:47
Federal policy has also led to the US being the dominant superpower for what ?  70-80 years?  And we have a pretty high standard of living.  All under federal policy.  And all this has been going on since long before you ever decided to chime in with your thoughts on monetary policy.  Maybe you arent the expert we need figuring out how to run the money for a 19 trillion dollar economy.  What are your qualifications, by the way?
@_date: 2018-03-01 23:58:41
The other 1% dont bother with the making it sound like a good idea in the first place.
@_date: 2018-11-03 15:38:05


neither.  literally nearly noone ever has to do that at all.
@_date: 2018-03-13 00:21:23
oh i care about the pyramid scheme, scamming bullshit you guys are pulling with the blockchain hype and the cryptos like bitcoin :D   that shit I care about. I just dont fucking care to read every little hype article lie that you guys put out.  why waste my time.
and again, show me the productive blockchain that isnt retards trading tokens.  show me.
@_date: 2018-11-02 20:34:48
there arent sides.   ive seen a million sales pitches for crypto and they all have been shot down, logically.  the only thing its good for is illegality.  thats a fact.  not a side.
thats like saying theres two sides to the flat earth debate.  no.  there isnt.  just because idiots exist doesnt make every single thing in the world a 'debate'.
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:54:05
you are my fuckin hero.  
@_date: 2018-03-13 00:28:37
i do know they are seperate things.  both are useless. both are the basis for all these scams and get rich quick schemes.  both accomplish absolutely nothing useful.  you continue to fail to point me to one working productive blockchain.  or crypto.  say it right now.  dont bother typing out some other shit.  just show me the working miracle code you worship in action.  it must be being used somewhere you stupid fuckin zealot
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:01:21
just like you guys
