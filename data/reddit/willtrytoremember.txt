Im late to the party on this one but wow, that is inaccurate. House advantage is HUGE and almost ALWAYS covers bonus money, unless you are dealing with a large package of sharps but if you are offering a 20-30 cent line what sharp would depo with you in teh 1st place?

Yes thats true, but any book i play there is s strick stipluation that any customer who bets both sides of the same match both bets are voided in terms of rollover.  You will will only be juicing out.  I suppose you could get a friend and have him be your beard to have seemingly opposing players pick against themselves but if they catch you then they seize everything anyhow, thanks for the info though!

Question for you, wouldn't this be bad for everyone involved in crypto? Isn't the point of BTC supposed to be that oppressive governments cannot stop it or take it away from ppl?  China seems they can completely steer this market any way they see fit.   How can adopters stop this or at least fight this behavior?

ya man BUT i specifically am saying these fly by night operations like coinbet have no where near the same odds as an exchange like betfair. betfair isnt even a sportsbook its an exchange. Big difference.  I am solely saying and in this situation ONLY**** booking at 20-30-40 cent lines (1.91, 1.8) those rollover numbers are no sweat for books concerning 99% of the public bettors.  you will never see betfair offer 100% bonus ever.  Only books with the shitty odds to cover them will.

Well if you have the time and dont mind explaining me the whole house advantage 1% claim?? Also table games are not considered here since this is stricky a sportsbook bonus (casino is always seperate as to my knowledge).  And coinbet aint no pinnacle or matchbook or even betfair with 4-6-8 cent lines.  (forgive my use of american odds) If you are booking people at -110 -115 -120 and they are not chasing steam or playing consistent dog action a 20x rollover on 100% bonus is more than safe for the bookmaker
EDIT: After a google search, seems you were talking about a specific game "sathoshidice" with that 1% edge number.  Never heard of it myself, maybe there was confusion there. I am speaking solely about sports wagering bonuses.
