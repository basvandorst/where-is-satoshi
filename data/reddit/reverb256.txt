Yeah, more customer responsibility than the old systems.  
More power to the user.  This is what we signed up for, with full awareness.

Voluntary cooperation on large projects like roads are now infinitely easier and more possible thanks to modern connectivity. The centralist model is becoming obsolete. We can do so much better.

The next step for Human evolution is for individuals to empower themselves and each other through the application of decentralized systems.

Any centralized "authority" can only regulate Bitcoin by interfering with the individual bitcoin users it has jurisdiction over.  It will probably be much more difficult to regulate than the internet.

@_date: 2014-01-20 23:11:03
That's because it's never been tried, because throughout history there have always been authoritarians who think they're better than everyone, telling all their 'subjects' what to do and controlling them with force.
Centralized authority deserves no respect, and the world would be a better place if all authoritarians simultaneously had multiple strokes and heart attacks.

It's not unfair, the status quo powers are purely holding all of Humanity back.

It's so juvenile, and frankly it's embarrassing to be part of a species that tolerates such behaviour.
We could accomplish so much more by working together instead of building fortresses to compete with each other.  I have observed, however, that people are truly realizing this.  Decentralized voluntary cooperation can naturally replace centralized control if we really want it to.
@_date: 2014-03-30 10:02:08
So are you going to make a point or what?
@_date: 2014-03-31 20:02:32

Centralization is *very fragile*.
The only reason people trust centralists is because they don't know any better.
@_date: 2014-03-26 00:20:06
Why can't we be a civilization of voluntarily connected individuals, wherein each Human has equal authority over other Humans (that which is consented to)?
Obviously this is not what we have now, and can seem impossible to some people.  Even still, is it not worthwhile to have some kind of vision for the future that doesn't involve Humanity extinguishing or coercing itself to death over ridiculous small-minded powermongering bullshit?
I want to have faith in Humanity, because I know that we can solve these problems.  
But we can't do it without new ideas, like decentralization as a core principle instead of centralization - just as an example.

It seems to me that governments and corporations are forms of AI. They run on pre-programmed routines like a computer. Input from preferred sources, process according to code/law, output results.
They are not Human, they do not represent Human values, and they do not value Human life.  They are  machines.

@_date: 2014-04-18 16:44:51
Everything that Humans create is built on everything Humanity has ever created. Therefore, the accomplishments of Humanity belong to all of Humanity. And money is nothing more than a system which limits Human potential by tying it to something which is finite. Humanity's potential is NOT finite.

Systems which concentrate power attract people who know how to exploit weaknesses in these systems.
This is a natural progression of events that can be more easily observed in hyper-accelerated systems compared to typical politics. Every system has exploits, analog or digital.
Politics can be "hacked", corporations can be "hacked" and as they are 'artificial intelligence' systems they can be infected with "viruses". 
As a result of their centralized nature, Capitalism and Socialism are both vulnerable to systemic exploits and therefore bad for everyone.
Corporations are just micro socialist systems in their 'everything you do belongs to us' mentality.

Everything that Humans create is built on everything Humanity has ever created. Therefore, the accomplishments of Humanity belong to all of Humanity. And money is nothing more than a system which limits Human potential by tying it to something which is finite. Humanity's potential is NOT finite.

It seems to me that governments and corporations are already forms of AI. They run on pre-programmed routines like a computer. Input from preferred sources, process according to code/law, output results.
Humans are definitely not inherently evil, but centralized systems are too easy for evil people to exploit.

Systems which concentrate power attract people who know how to exploit weaknesses in these systems.
This is a natural progression of events that can be more easily observed in hyper-accelerated systems compared to typical politics. Every system has exploits, analog or digital.
Politics can be "hacked", corporations can be "hacked" and as they are 'artificial intelligence' systems they can be infected with "viruses". 
As a result of their centralized nature, Capitalism and Socialism are both vulnerable to systemic exploits and therefore bad for everyone.
Corporations are just micro socialist systems in their 'everything you do belongs to us' mentality.

Do you think Humanity should be under rulers, or free from their influence?
Do you believe that individuals deserve a say in the matter?  Why or why not?
Personally, I am disgusted by people who seek power over others.  In placing themselves above others, they become creatures of manipulation.  They relinquish their capacity for empathy, and thus their very Humanity.
Networks of these beings can be accurately compared to 'artificial intelligence'.

Voluntary cooperation on large projects like roads are now infinitely easier and more possible thanks to modern connectivity. The centralist model is becoming obsolete. We can do so much better. Like I have said elsewhere, this is an adolescent civilization currently. The next step for Human evolution is for individuals to empower themselves and each other through the application of decentralized systems.
All 'Humans in control of giant systems' seem to want to do is to hurt and control other Humans. It's so juvenile, and frankly it's embarrassing to be part of a species that tolerates such behaviour.

This happened because Ukraine was going with Russian deals instead of EU. So US, NATO and their mercs supported a violent neoNAZI coup in Kiev (this is not an exaggeration, look into the INDIVIDUALS in the 'Ukrainian interim government' - they are well documented). ALSO, because Russia is pressuring countries to buy oil using something other than the DOLLAR.
We know now for a fact that these Svoboda and Right Sector thugs are Neo-Nazis. We have also seen their heinous crimes since receiving power. Is it not time for us to admit we made a mistake supporting these actions? 
Here is some detail on the Kiev nazis:

Euphemisms and rationalizations for something that relies basically on threats and physical power.  
Does this inspire respect? lol
I think Humans should abolish euphemisms and rationalizations.
If I tell you that 100% of everything you produce belongs to ME, is that slavery? What about 70%? 50%? Where is the difference made? One group of people doesn't deserve such power over other people. It's illegitimate in every way.

This is the nature of software development - challenges arise that can and will be solved.  It is an organic process.
Any time you see something that should exist in the ecosystem, you should be thinking 'Not Yet Implemented' - because for every demand identified there will be an answer developed.

If they do try to regulate, it will increase adoption of BTC.
If finally come out and say they not try to regulate, it will increase adoption of BTC.
Finally, if they make it illegal, it will increase adoption of BTC.
I'm not seeing a downside.
The power of the governments over Bitcoin is comparable to the level of power they hold over Bittorrent.
