@_date: 2014-07-08 17:24:25
WOW! Very kind of you! thank you!! my first official bitcoins :D I appreciate it bud :)
@_date: 2014-08-01 17:56:24
you can't take a joke here and there buddy?
@_date: 2014-07-08 16:50:46
gotcha gotcha. okay cool. If I was still in the dorms at my university with free internet I might have been able to mine easier haha. So I mean, as weird as it sounds, what exactly do you guys do here then? Did you BUY bitcoins with USD (or wherever you guys are from) and just leave a few in your accounts? or what?
@_date: 2014-07-08 16:19:52
So you don't mine and any of that stuff?

This is the first circlejerk post I've seen here this whole week and it looks like majority of the people here seem to not mind it but you and few others. 
let it slide. not a big deal. have fun with it.

yeah fortunately I'm not one who wanders into random sites. I literally go to the same websites every day haha.
but thanks man, really looking forward to being more active in this community and bitcoins.

Thank you!!!! And I just finished reading them. But I will scan my personal computer with malwarebytes and the windows security essential anti-virus tonight just to be sure. Though I don't really download too many things and don't visit random websites - but nevertheless, I will still take the precaution.

how much would YOU personally consider to be a considerable amount??? I realize they going price of bitcoins is 1 bitcoin = $622 (as of now), so when people tip on here are they theoritcally tipping in "cents"? like what do you call "cents" in bitcoin??? bits = cents while bitcoins = dollars??? just trying to understand the wording and stuff lol

this is fucking reddit. learn the greatest language on Earth, called English or get the fuck out - kindly.

Very helpful post. thank you! So you would recommend me to download the Bitcoin Wallet on my android phone? is that the app to scan QR codes to send bitcoins? I'm an accounting and finance major so I know a little about how many works and flows - but does it work a little bit differently on bitcoin?

I just hate people like you who bring up some bullshit subreddit and tell the OP this content belongs there instead of here. This topic is about Bitcoins. It belongs in simple as that.
I can take a good criticism. yours is just pathetic and sounds butt hurt.
