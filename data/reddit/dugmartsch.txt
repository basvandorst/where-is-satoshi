JFK did nothing but extend the power of the Federal Reserve.

I think chargebacks are one of those things that different companies handle differently.  Some are very, very aggressive on behalf of the consumer, like american express, and others don't really give a shit. 
The only chargeback I've ever had was from an AMEX card, and even though we eventually won, they provided exactly zero details about the reason for the chargeback.  The chargeback made zero sense and my only defense was that they were there, they paid with the credit card and took their merchandise and left.  If I remember correctly it was some antique watch faces and vintage illustrations, which thankfully I'd noted down on the receipt.  They said the process could take some ridiculously long amount of time after I submitted my defense and I was fully prepared to lose.  Three or four months go by and I send a follow up email, and get something back along the lines of "we're happy to inform you that your case was decided in your favor!  Here's your money."  Money was back in my account (they take it while you wait) within the day.  Don't think they'd ever have given it back if I hadn't followed up, and they specifically said not to bother them as the process could take a long time.
The only company that seems vigilant about chargebacks for their customers is AMEX.  But they have a lot of reason to try to keep their customers who are racking up those massive fees all the time, so it makes sense.
Such a strange black box of a process, but definitely not a slam dunk for a consumer who initiates one.

If I were invested in a stock and it had lost 70% of it's value and I was still able to lock in a profit, I would lock in my profit.

Currencies are mediums of exchange, their value is denominated by how easy the are to exchange for goods and services.  
It is basically impossible to exchange bitcoin for goods or services, it is not a good currency.  
I'm not even against cryptocurrencies, but bitcoin is a failure, it has no future.
