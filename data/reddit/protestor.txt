Bitcoins are uninsured, too.
@_date: 2015-06-07 00:35:38
This is true. But.. currently, people keep their money in the bank, a centralized service. The idea is that their deposit is usually insured by the central bank (up to a certain amount), so even if the bank goes bankrupt the money is still safe.
A large sum of money can also be kept with financial instruments like stocks or bonds. Bitcoin is an instrument too, if you're willing to bear its risk.
Bitcoin is decentralized, but for most people this just mean that they are in charge of its security - unless they rely in a centralized service. And since the market is still very unregulated, there's nobody guaranteeing that your centralized service won't be the next Mt. Gox.

The topic at hand is


This solution is good for security, but implies the user wants to handle private keys.
(relying on a third party may be necessary, but negate the "benefit" of decentralization - plus, your centralized service may be the next Mt. Gox)
But multisig doesn't really solve the problem of a stolen device. If you can spend Bitcoins with your cellphone, whoever steals it can spend them exactly the same way. *That* is the problem. Perhaps the solution is to have a "small wallet" for your smartphone, without all your funds.
If you use a passphrase (which you should).. then it either has enough entropy (which is unlikely - let's be realistic, passphrases are a terrible UI and people tend to just forget) or it can easily be broken.

But people can be born at home too, you know. Who should sign the certificate in this case, the parents? Some witness?
In some parts of the world people don't always register their children. This means they don't have a proof of citizenship (even though they are citizens by birth). In my country (Brazil) all such documents are free and the government makes campaigns (such as [this one from 2010]( with the soccer player Ronaldo), but there are still people without a birth certificate.
In this case, suppose we want to make the birth certificate "more trustworthy" by employing crypto. Are we going to say "from now on, every birth certificate must have a digital signature"? How will this impact people that reached their teens (or even adult age) without a birth certificate?
@_date: 2014-06-18 23:18:40
The reason Bitcoin won't ever reach this market cap is how fast initial mining was conducted.
If the network was tweaked to have in the first 5 years only, say, 2% of the total coins mined (and overall be shaped like a logistic function), it would make more sense for the current holders of the majority of wealth to let Bitcoin become this big. Now they have zero incentive to lobby for legislation favorable to Bitcoin, convert they own wealth to Bitcoins, etc. On the contrary: if Bitcoin rises this much, initial miners will have a very large share of total wealth of Humanity.

I don't know whether it will lead to failure. Perhaps it depends on what we consider failure. Bitcoin may fill a niche and perhaps replace Paypal but still not become big enough to replace the dollar as a reserve currency (for example). On the other hand, it could be killed by legislation or be substituted by something else, and this could be linked to those supply problems.
Aurora tries to alleviate this by seeding coins to citizens of a country (well it seems it's [too much valued]( but it's an idea). I don't know of any other cryptocurrency that addresses this issue.
On the contrary, some new coins are just blatant pyramids: the early adopters get sucked into it and try to invite more people to recoup their "investment".
One could argue that the current Bitcoin price is driven by speculation and not real use. Indeed a lot of people are hoping Bitcoin prices to go up so they can have a profit. I don't think Bitcoin was created with this purpose though.
I think that at some point, some powerful country or organization will roll their own cryptocurrency. An example could be China: they are talking with other BRICS members about rolling a currency for international trade.
Anyway one idea would be to not have a cap on the total number of coins, but instead mine coins to match some external index like the production of certain commodities (the idea being that the money supply would increase to match the economic growth).
Other idea would be to use a logistic curve like I cited: for the initial years people would get a comparatively small share, and hopefully the currency gets noticed before the steeper part of the curve. A trouble, of course, is that it makes it harder for the early adopters to get richer - so why would anyone bother?

Not if the whole supply chain is paid with Bitcoins. It probably won't happen in the US, because the government will protect the dollar at all costs - but it's still a possibility.
Even if there is a conversion, consider that when you put money at your Paypal account you're technically converting dollars into fake money - your balance is still denominated in dollars but in reality you are at mercy of Paypal until your get your money out of there (they can freeze your account; they can go bankrupt; etc). Bitcoin may become something like Paypal, only that there is no central entity to screw you over.

Actually, that's the point. For Bitcoin to take over global trade, the people that currently hold world's wealth need to cooperate with it. I'm not arguing whether it's right or wrong to replace them with Bitcoin early adopters.


The trouble is that the rate of new Bitcoins was poorly tuned. It distributed too much coins when the network was relatively unknown. Anyone was allowed to participate, but almost nobody knew about it. A better fit could be a [logistic curve]( where in the very beginning few coins would be distributed.
In the way it was set up, it benefited too much early adopters.

That's really cool! How could someone in Brazil (like myself) get involved?
I too expect that government as we know it will eventually cease to exist if technology enables people to be self-sufficient, and I would expect that currently impoverished areas would greatly benefit from it. This would be a drastic economic change and would also result in a huge power shift. It's up to whoever is holding power right now to decide how to react. I suspect there would be a violent reaction, because nobody wants to give up power they conquered by force.
I wrote some my views in an [early comment]( (I'm reading it, I've found out that I was heavily downvoted in that thread, [like this]( That's interesting)
We *could* live in a gift economy if resources weren't so scarce. But as long as we rely on trade, we aren't substituting money itself (in contrary to "no money is changing hands"). Trading without money is generally inefficient, and at same time it continues of course to be taxable.
Also even if you live all by yourself the government may still want to tax you (see the attempts to tax home solar power, with backing of utilities). That's one form to exercise government violence, and I expect it to become steeper if technology makes it easier for people to live without taxes. Even land is taxed, and perhaps [other things will be too](

If the blockchain forks, the coins you had before the fork will be present on both forks. So, for example, if you have 50 BTC previously, you will have 50 BTC on either fork.

Oh I get it. I agree, increasing the block size is not merely a technical issue because any fork would need to be deployed to end users before the forking date.
What I think is that while there's a section of the community that is talking "forks are bad, let's not talk about forks", I think it's the opposite, we need to seriously consider whether the Bitcoin community has the tools to carry out any needed forks, in a timely manner, without anyone being left behind. The current wallets *should* have a mechanism to inform users about forks.
While perhaps the block size limit doesn't warrant a hard fork (I have no dog in this fight), being capable of deploying such fork is a very important capability.

The possibility of a hard fork will always be present, because the protocol itself could contain a security flaw.
If a critical exploit is found at the protocol level you better believe the implementations will perform a hard fork. That's what happened with SSL 2.0 and SSL 3.0, for example: to protect against vulnerabilities, you need to use a browser that is *not* compatible with them. That's why current versions of Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer don't support those protocol versions - everyone moved to TLS 1.0 or later.
So, you already need to prepare for the contingency of performing a hard fork should the need arises. Yes, it would suck - there is no way to signal to an old client that he's using a vulnerable protocol version.

I think we shouldn't dismiss Gavin as "not as capable as the core devs".
I think that much more important than deploying a bigger block size *now* is deploying a client that is able to switch to it in the future (as delineated [there]( It's not possible to deploy a hard fork instantly.
If the Bitcoin ecosystem agree in deploying a client today that will switch to a bigger block in 1 year (or another time frame), we might be confident that most people will have upgraded by then. This new client should also come with a protocol for negotiating further block increases, in a very conservative way, so that we don't find ourselves in this situation again. I don't see how deploying this will delay other features.
But if Bitcoin Core stalls this issue for another year, then lightning may win by default, even in the hypothesis that it's not the most technically sound choice.

This "settlement layer" talk is being pushed by devs that want to make transactions on the blockchain artificially scarce, so that people will have no option but to move to other "layers".
[Here is what Satoshi had to say about the blocksize limit](










Back then it was no big deal. Some people could foresee a controversy:


If we upgrade now, we don't have to convince as much people later if the bitcoin economy continues to grow.


I agree, especially since generators are both the source of blocks and "votes" in the network.  Since a block restriction would allow generators to charge higher transaction fees, they might "vote" against an increase in the max size in the future.


But others were naive in thinking that such upgrade wouldn't be a real problem. :(

He later tells


It's unfortunate that he made some unfounded comments about Bitcoin, but yeah, he knows he's often wrong. It's also unfortunate that people were asking stuff outside his technical expertise.
Now, what he *could* have talked about is how Bitcoin is traceable if you aren't *very* careful, and use mixing. A point about some of his answers  is how much you can be de-anonymized by statistically improbable connections you have with other agents, and other side channels. Bitcoins leaks a lot of data about you.. and if you are careless, it will leak data about people you're doing business with, too.
As far as privacy is concerned, those are protocol issues, and there are Bitcoin alternatives that could, in theory, provide better anonymity. The trouble is that without a giant proof-of-work network running, they don't offer, in practice, the same robustness against attacks that Bitcoin does. *Right now*, Bitcoin is the best we can have.

You need to ask yourself if you want a lot of people to use Bitcoin or not. If a lot of people will *someday* use Bitcoin, their legitimate usage will look like DDoS under the current network. They are not, they are just people that want to buy stuff. But if Bitcoin is to be used only by comparatively few people, the current maximum block size seems about right.
PS: since the transition takes time, the maximum block size needs to be increased much before actual usage increases. Also, it's not sustainable to have the baseline usage close to the maximum block size - there needs to be some room for peak demand.

@_date: 2015-07-09 17:42:40
Do you understand that if the demand is greater than the network capacity, there will always be *someone* that wants to use Bitcoins but will be priced out due to "market forces"?
For example, suppose that in a given period there can only be 100 transactions, but there are 120 *real* transactions waiting to be confirmed (not considering spam or anything like that). It *doesn't matter* what price you set by transaction: at  least 20 people will be unable to send Bitcoins, but probably much more. If this situation persists, there will be more people unable to send Bitcoins in the next block, and so on.
Having to pay more and more for transactions will just push people out of the network due to "market forces": Bitcoin ceases to be a network that accommodates everyone that wants to use it. But what we should notice is that this gate-keeping is illegitimate: the block size limit is meant to be a value large enough so this situation doesn't happen in practice.
If the block size doesn't increase but the network continues to grow Bitcoin will cease to be an analog of "digital cash", because cash no bound on how many people can make transactions at the same time.

We also have to deal with people within the community dismissing technical solutions to scale the network as "hard fork attacks". Bitcoin needs to stop fighting with itself.
@_date: 2015-07-09 17:58:01
But the problem *isn't* the spam issue. Those can be fought with transaction fees.
The real issue is that *if* Bitcoin grows, there will be so many people using it that at any given moment a real person will try to send Bitcoins but be unable to do so, regardless of fees. That's because if at a given interval only 100 transactions can be processed but 120 people want to send Bitcoins, 20 will be left out. I wrote this reasoning [in another sub-thread](
@_date: 2015-07-03 12:46:37

One year from now, or five years from now, or ten years from now, someone in the NSA may think about making a list of people that visited a certain site around 2016. And the problem is, the software they use to make such analysis is only getting better.
So perhaps right now they don't care whether you visit a wiki page on some subreddit, but they have this information just in case.
