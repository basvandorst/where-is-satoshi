For 1. How can Bob spend the same .05BTC on the main chain if he has already spent it in the off-chain payment channel? A transaction occurs on the main chain when the channel is opened and BTC funds are deposited (right?). That's why it says for every lightning channel, there are only 2 transactions on the main chain, one when it is opened with the initial deposit, and one when it is closed with the final balance sheet.

I absolutely *LOVE* NNT, but yeah, this made me cringe

It's not *just* Coinbase, Chase credit cards now charge as cash advance for bitcoin purchases &amp; Capital One cards are declining all crypto currency credit card purchases. I'm sure other issuers will follow suite eventually.

Those hundreds or thousands of channels being opened or closed contain several transactions each that are occurring outside of the blockchain and prevent it from being congested further. Sure, the blockchain could then become congested with channel opening and closing transactions but it will ultimately be *less* congested than what it would be without lightning channel transactions. 
And I think you have a misunderstanding if you think that funds are unverifiable on a lightning channel because you can’t send something you haven’t already sent to the lightning wallet. Also, when Sally sends money to the coffee shop, even though it goes through Bobs channel, he has no control over the funds.

It's more likely because credit card companies are very strict on cash like purchases because of money laundering and fraud, which is why a lot of them shut down accounts for buying too many gift cards. You also can't buy any other actual currency or use your credit card for cash at an atm without a cash advance fee and ridiculous apr.

Still trying to wrap my head around it as well, I dont know that the user necessarily gets to chose what channels the payment goes through to get to the vendor. 
A user could have a lightning channel to, lets say, Amazon, and then several hundreds of small vendors also have channels open to Amazon. So when you go to pay a small business, your payment will route through Amazon's channel without needing to open a new channel to the small vendor.
I think the hardest part to understand is that Amazon wouldn't control the channels that is used between you and the small business and they wouldn't be able to charge a fee for using it. 
I wonder if they could charge a fee for establishing a lightning channel? But then that could completely prevent them from acquiring a massive amount of channels, and vendors would just establish channels elsewhere to do business with Amazon.

Do we need an excuse for a wild orgy?

Why is that exactly? What about the halving would potentially make the price increase? Is it because the rate at which new btc are added into circulation is lowered and makes it more "scarce"?

Ah that makes sense, not sure why it never occurred to me that they are on the supply side of the equation, therefore their motivations to sell are different from a typical investor.

Simplex, but the price you buy at is usually inflated a little. And keep in mind that certain banks will decline cryptocurrency purchases.
