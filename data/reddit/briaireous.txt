This, never panic and sell. You've made the best investment you could make in our time. 
The 3 essentials of investing in crypto.
1. If you don't know how to day trade, don't. Day traders make money from the ones who don't know what they're doing.
2. Never spend more than your willing to lose. 
3. Hold on for dear life (HODL)
Sit back and watch your investment grow in the coming months and years!

Havent tested it much but works well from what I can tell. May I ask where it's collating the prices from?

Hahaha, yea ok. Whatever makes you sleep better at night knowing you've missed out, because YOU are too ignorant to understand economics. And I honestly don't give a shit of you own bitcoin or not

This is not a bubble, this is a market correction there is a huge difference

How many bitcoin do you have... Probably none, which is why you think it's a pyramid scheme and you think a fluctuation of $150 is a bubble.

Official signalling was meant to start today, 19th. For a lock in by the 21st. But some pools started early on the 17th.

Because emerging markets, european and american markets are in a recovery period. With only Asian markets suffering at the moment.
