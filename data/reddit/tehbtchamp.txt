A wallet developer promoting his own product is putting out a hit piece on his competition?  Makes me not trust the BRD brand that they do such a biased, loaded hit job.

I took my salary in BTC.  Now, trying to figure how to pay my mortgage.  Both because it requires fiat and also because the value of BTC tanked.  Wish I didn't take my salary in BTC, and it's not because I don't have a list of merchants scattered globally I can't actually deal with.
BTC is not there yet for salary.  You can't solve this problem until there are things like house loans via BTC.  Stop pretending like you can at this point in time and BTC will become better and more healthy.  The right stuff needs to come on scene, not just code such as a list of merchants globally.

Can you just spin up a VM running a driver to automatically 'watch' all ads and take the satoshis as you play golf?

Unless someone controls &gt;50% of it.  That is the opposite of minimizing trust.

So BRD releases a dishonest, loaded, hit-job on their competition all while promoting their product?   Sounds like dishonest BRD is who should be avoided.

Oh, you were on the upswing of the volatility.   Please, talk to me more!

Eclair is pretty crappy.  We need to talk the LND guys to write a good, open source wallet.  The current state is not good.

You're a moron.  The entire system is so you don't have to trust.  The fact that you are fine with trusting an entity, this case China, with everything shows you're the enemy to BTC.
@_date: 2018-06-28 23:21:23
lol, the point is nobody should own it.  Just you mentioning 'owns' shows how clueless you are and how failed BTC is if nobody cares or acts on it.

It was a long-term contract.  When funding a company via BTC, someone has to take the risk.  During negotiation, I took on this risk to start the venture thinking BTC will turn out higher long term (and still do).   If I didn't take the risk, the other option was just shutting down due to lack of payment and losing everything and all potential with 0 return of the venture.  As it is, we are still continuing, but I'm taking the brunt of the BTC drop.  This proves that BTC is not stable enough for things like salary yet, compared to fiat at it's current state, when you're forced into one side taking massive looses should BTC fluctuate so much undesirably.
I did not expect for BTC to tank so heavily.  I have to convert it now to save our house instead of hodling, like I would want to do as I believe in it.  Taking salary via BTC was a big gamble on my part, and turns out, a big mistake to do so at this point in time.
Had there been some way to convert my house loan into BTC to pair it to what my salary is, that would have solved the majority of my current suffering.
I'm not bringing this out to diss BTC, but to highlight that there need to be other functioning services like home loans in order to make use of BTC as a salary.  Just highlighting a few companies that take BTC is a band-aid on the underlying problem, and I hope this will show what is really needed to make BTC what it can be.

That's probably why China will soon be taking &gt; 51% of BTC hashrate. (in response to the headline quote)

I bet he tried somehow to get it 'stolen' or attempted to be malicious with the channel in some way to show how bad lighting is, failed, then went home with his tail between his legs.

OK, so what you're saying is there is some code somewhere out there on the internet.  That's nice.  
But how do I verify what's **actually** on my hardware wallet?  By having a hardware wallet, I'm just trusting a complete stranger with all my crypto.


@_date: 2018-07-06 07:42:26
Ah, so when someone says "Don't trust", it means I and everyone need to become a computer manufacturers.  Gotcha!

How do I verify what's actually in my hardware wallet?  Right now, I'm just trusting my hardware wallet.
@_date: 2018-07-27 00:22:35
Another off-topic post.  I'm sure it's more likely for a hardware wallet to go missing then a safety deposit box.  Let's just all be real, please.

Take your paper wallet.  Duplicate it 5 times.  Replace 4/5th of each copy with random, real-looking junk leaving just 1/5 of each copy with a valid section of the original.  Your paper wallet is now the combination of 5 paper wallets.  Should someone find your papers, physical or cached, they will find 5 invalid paper wallets.  You, knowing the randomness of what is actually the valid portions, will have your good paper wallet only readable by you.
Still not perfect, but much better then a single readable paper wallet for someone to find.

Yeah, my 98 year old grandma sure can adequately verify all this tech stuff for herself in order to use it to function and live.

I hear your point, but it's the stupid blind "banks can screw up" so be your own infallible bank yourself(!) attitude which is what is so stupid.  A lot of people like banks because they don't trust themselves not to screw themselves over.  But then cryptocurrency just somehow 'magically' solves this concern, because, you know, banks screw up every once in a while too as shown with cherry-picked articles out of millions of banks.  Let's just all be real and not pretend being your own bank is some magical solution to this particular concern when a lot of people use a service because *they don't trust themselves*.  Good for you for being competent to trust yourself, but I don't think my elderly, deteriorating grandparents can trust their ability with a hardware and/or paper wallet to survive off of day-to-day.
How about we keep to the topic of Bitcoin instead of this repeating this stupid straw man argument?  I'm all for crypto, but this is a stupid way to go about it.  People see through garbage more then you think.  It's just a circle-jerk feel-good jab which does not promote Bitcoin on it's own merit.
For example, I am sooooo happy I don't have to trust myself with cooking to stay alive every day.  I place that trust in others, and I gladly do so.  Yes, I have gotten food poisoning before because I put my trust in strangers, but I'm still trusting others preparing my life-sustaining food preparations.  I guess because some cook somewhere caused food poisoning, everybody in society should then 'be their own cooks' at all times because all cooks are bad?  Such a stupid argument, I wish it would stop.

They are not all 'clueless'.  A lot are being paid off by banks and credit card related companies.
Even more the reason they need to be called out.
