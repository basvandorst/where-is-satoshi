Hold on man. Somethings been eating away at you and you'd like to get it off your chest, so you decided to write a post? Before you post find out what it was that was eating at you and get it off your chest - insect, reptile? It might have venomous  so you might wanna see a doctor. Yikes!

Cost me $60 to send 200 so not sure you will be paying more in fees than $20 though. If you set the fee lower than default it will still cost more than $20 and the transaction might be stuck forever or few a few weeks if you are lucky. Dont waste your money trying to move it.

Well its cringey i hated it. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:48:47
I could create a hardfork and solve the priblem very fast. Its open source but bitcoin community does not want me to fix bitcoin. I would leave blockstream in the dust. 
I would call my fork 'bitcoin boobies' and it would rocket to the moon so fast blockstream would cry

People are resorting to stealing fro  exchanges jsut because they have to pay tens of dollars to pay microtransactioins????
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:52:01
If you find the millions and want to transfer it it put at least a hundre d thousand dolars as the fee to be able to get it to confirm before the pool rejects it.
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:38:26
It will cost 70 dollars but look out becuase the fees are going to bite your wallet the hardest :(
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:36:54
Lighten ing network is only something bitcoin has to resort to doing, it will probobly fail like segwit adoption.

The only place that a child pays for a parent is in bitcoin world.
Tons of children are paying grocery bills to their parents because their mums and dads spent money on bitcoin and then the price crashed.
Tldr: send more cash to blockstream

Bitcoin has just been developing a bad reputation of late and nobody wants anything to do with it. Shops are djmping it in droves :(
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:47:22
You should put a 1000 fee on it and it might get confirmed in a day. The general rule seems to be that you must put higher fees than what you are sending
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:13:56
Alot of people are worried the price will crash hard and wont want to pay huge fees

Well you might claim im lying but only he can make that judgement when he actually sends it. It wont be on my conscious if he pays huge fees but then again it wont be on yours either. Proof is in the pudding.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:32:29
Just wait another month btc will be lower. Dont listen to these moonshot lies. Ive got even better news for you. In 6 months btc will be so cheap youll be able to buy 2 bitcoins.
Discounts galore in 2018.

@_date: 2017-12-30 23:59:49
This is cary becuase no only are fees to slow and expensive but now people are having their funds go into a black hole. I expect bitcoin to be replaced next year and i hope blockstream goes down with it *cries*
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:04:54
You can pay huge fees for everybody. Couple of million

I think its going to get dumped in the trash can of crypto. I will become the ultimate shitcoin beyond measure.
Its already a freaking joke just by scammers to get rich. It looks to be a victim of its own sucess. Its like these idiots think improvement is a bad thing. They make promises but never deliver on them.
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:08:32
I think its something blockstream should be doing.

Soon it will cost $1000 to transfer 1 dollar and blockstream seems immune to critisim. 
Alot of people blame the h8gh fees on users and say to make the fees small but when this is done people get stuck transactions
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:10:01
Its a dead project 2018 is final year for bitcoin and its not roger vers fault. Now i know blockstream is run by bankers
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:00:25
Id cash out you wont find any commercial enterprises offering sheds for bitcoin. You could end up paying a fortune in fees and still not get a confirmation after several days. Its only going to get worse
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:09:24
 The true mooning has yet to come, yes, in a few decades. But the moaning has already started
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:10:47
Dont worry about it. He or she probobly paid about $50 usd in fees to send that and it will cost you a further $50 in fees to send it back. After you consider fees for a round trip like that, $20 is such a pitiful amount youd wish you could delete it from your wallet
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:42:29
The price will crash harder now though becuase bitcoin only has brand recognition going for it. Its the worst coin you can put your money into based on technology. Its turned into a true shitcoin and a scamcoin.
These meme makers are con artists just trying to line their pockets with more cash by feeding newbies with false hope with speculative investment advice based predictions of the future based on past trends in a rapidly changing marketplace.
I certainly would not be encouraging then to dump fiat into bitcoin. I would encourage them to invest in alts that have better teams and technology
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:41:33
Pay some huge fees regardless and it will take a long time to confirm
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:55:28
Ripple will probobly take care of that i expdct ripple will take over :(
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:34:49
Thankyou for telling me that. I wont be using it until it is solved. Until then i will bcash my fiat away!!
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:41:40
Nobody likes btc anymore due to fees. Its got a bad reputation and blockstream doesnt care. Its all starting to look like a currency the flinstones would use.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:47:30
Dont need to learn how it works to know its going to have to take effort to learn.  I cant be bothered with running around opening channels. I cant be bothered learning to use segwit. 
It took me 5 months just to bother to figure out how to redeem my bitcoin cash of which i had 500 bucks waiting for me. I cant be bothered unless people set it by default
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:34:32
I think its going to crash below 10k alot of people are angry as hell about fees
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:09:15
Maybe it secretly is
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:08:28
Moving things from wallet to wallet. Buting it with bitcoin is going to bite your ledger with fees, moving your coins to the ledger is going to bite too
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:02:37
Well now your ego is talking if you feel better with psying with bitcoin. What if you pay him and the prices crashes
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:43:56
They have got a point about fees though. Its not like people are lying. The fee's suck

Nope the china miners will crush u and anyway you will be paying more in fees than your earnings just moving it to a safe wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:36:20
The way the puzzle works for bitcoin is like scanning all the transactions and finding the ones with the highest fees and doing them first, pretty much. The cryptographic puzzle part is bcore and blockstream's attempt at hiding their money grab for the bankers each time one of these transactions occur. A huge skimming operation for the banks. Poison for its long term survivability
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:32:50
U a bcash shill
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:42:49
Lightning network is fault free ive been using it for weeks on mainnet. Fees were close to zero and i bought a coffee too. The shops all around here use it.
EDIT: OOPS SORRY I WAS USING A VISA CARD LOL
Edit 2: u still a bcash shill 
Edit 3: look at my posting history
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:58:08
Ive got 0 bitcoin and will never be buying it again. Reason: fees

Everybody hated windows vista but blockstream decided that it was best to stick with windows 98
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:44:22
Roger ver will have to be the boss at the end because blockstream has got the be the princess we got to save with our fees. Everytime we attack ver in the game we have to spend money on fees. We have got to shoot ver with the transazction gun and pay fees. We have to save blockstream before our life savings in fiat run  out. 
We will die when we go broke. That china guy can help us out with his litecoin sword
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:51:30
You shouldnt need to lock your coins becuase the fees should be a deterrant in the first place

All the bitcoin developme t is comiing from forks lol. Nobody wants to develop btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:17:52
Wont work. Huge fees and huge confirmation times. Stupid idea or fake news
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:50:42
Bitcoin causes way more problems than what it solves. Its developers dont actually aim to solve any problems unless its got to do with ways of lining the pockets of the miners and if they the few decent devs try to save bitcoin they are banished and any improvements are hard forked. Everybody is starting to hate it.
That andreas onolononopolpoloisis guy was broke shilling bitcoin core so hard till he has huge permanent circles under his eyes. Some bankers at blockstream then sent him 2 huge donations of funny money (KYC/AML rules not applicable for bankers) after roger ver tweeted at him (roger felt sorry that he was an unpaid slave).

It cant be done. Bitcoin is flintstones technology. Real caveman stuff. Slow, expensive, inefficient. No devlopment going on unless you want to hardfork.
No interest in solvi g pronlems except for unworkable garbage like LN which is a ploy to get banks to work as big LN HUBS.

Bcore bully bitch, kindly lose your money to fees.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:21:47
LN is going to fail just like segwit. Im certainly too lazy to "set up" a channel and "load it up" to buy shit.  It would need to be done by default without any change. Ill just make myself rich and buy stuff from alternative currencies.
I cant give a stuff about working my brain hard enough to use segwit. Its hard enough for commoners like myself to use crypto as it is. Dont even satrt on the effort i didnt make on multisig LOL
face it. Nobody is going to bother but it will take a year to be fully plimented and another year for you to see it fail
!RemindMe 2 years
