One could argue that the cell phone has had a revolutionary effect on communication. Many years passed between the first release and its current form. Bitcoin is a bit more complex, although there are some parallels. We are adopting it now not because of what we can buy with it at present, but because we understand its potential to buy things in the future when second layer programs for interacting with the blockchain are released. Think of it like the early days of the internet with Netscape and 14.4K dial-up modems. It was ridiculed by telcos for its flaws and rightly so. But the technology caught up. Now we are hard pressed to name any job that doesn't use the internet in some way.

Think further into the future. Any changes to the blockchain are permanent and will be irreversible for the entire history of bitcoin moving forward. The Core developers know this and are trying their best to ensure that the best possible outcome is achieved. The impulse to switch to a quick and non-ideal solution needs to be fought. We are in a tiny blip of a timeframe, in which bitcoin transactions have scaling issues, compared to the future history of bitcoin. Think 5 years later - with bitcoin having far superior solutions to scaling. All of this impatience will be silly then. 
So let's hold out patiently and wait for the right solutions. If bitcoin is to live for 1,000 years, people will still say "This was bitcoin's finest hour."
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:20:54
But would a private key to that address actually exist, despite no one knowing what it is?
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:07:47
For BTC price to drop, there needs to be a large sell-off. As long as there are enough people who believe in bitcoin's value, if the price drops, the lower priced bitcoins will all be purchased at a bargain price. 
So for someone to manipulate the market and win at shorting, they first need to 1) Buy enough bitcoin to affect global prices; 2) Sell it all off suddenly at a lower price; 3) Hope that not too many people buy it, and the price drops enough for them to fulfill their short position. If their calculations are off, they end up losing more than if they had just held the bitcoin they owned.

Bitcoins are not actually 'things.' The number of bitcoin in the blockchain is just a very tightly held record of transactions on a ledger. When we own bitcoin, we are merely given the ability to transact a specified balance to a new address.

A good analogy I read somewhere on reddit was traffic congestion in busy cities. BCH's answer is to increase the number of lanes on the roads (which, interestingly, has been shown not to have much overall effect at all in real-world situations). Segwit and LN's solution is to keep the roads as they are, but introduce new features like optimized traffic control and ridesharing services. We just have to wait longer for the smarter solutions to be tested thoroughly.

Some time ago, we held a trance reunion party and wanted to make a continuous playlist with all the tracks we knew and loved from back in the day. So I was searching for a DJ online who would be able to professionally mix the tracks together for us, and wanted to receive the mixed tracks back as an MP3. Surprisingly this kind of service is rare online. I managed to track down one DJ overseas and emailed him about it. We went back and forth on email a few times, but in the end because it was trance (and he was a trance lover), and because I offered to pay in bitcoin (and he was a bitcoin enthusiast), he ended up doing it for us right when we needed it. And a brilliant mix it was.

In that storyline, an IPO doesn't make sense. They are doing the IPO because they need money to stay afloat, at the expense of losing partial ownership and control of their company.
@_date: 2018-08-13 00:07:34
They're either insane, malevolent, or greedy. Or a combination of those.
Regardless, it seems they mistakenly thought overwhleming hashpower would allow them to influence the majority of bitcoin users into supporting an altcoin pump and dump. Even in the face of attack from the world's largest hashpower generator, bitcoin shows its resilience.
@_date: 2018-08-13 00:11:13

@_date: 2018-08-13 00:21:24
What this actually shows is that hashpower does not equate to control of the network. It's the users who decide what protocol they choose to adhere to, and what gives it value. The fact that they are going to IPO shows that they need money. If they had a hidden advantage, they wouldn't dilute their ownership by sharing it with others. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 00:27:58
Yes, and attacking the value of what is essentially one of your major products does not make a great deal of sense.

Congratulations. Don't worry about the short term fluctuations. Keep your focus on the long term trend. You own something of intrinsic value that only came into existence through the unprecedented convergence of cryptography, the laws of mathematics, and the internet. What you own is the manifestation of an idea - that wealth can be determined solely by market forces, and that technology can help protect us from the failings of financial policies that are beyond our control. By holding bitcoin, you stand in solidarity with others who believe in the right to control our own proof-of-work, and transfer it to others without paying exorbitant fees to financial institutions (whose primary aim it is to take as much of your wealth as possible).  
@_date: 2017-03-02 20:24:16

Yes, I think it's wrong to label 'the other side' as a group of short-sighted thugs who are part of a conspiracy to attack bitcoin. Some individuals on both sides of the Core vs BU argument are guilty of arrogance and name-calling. But we can also see that there are people on both sides who are highly intelligent, reasonable, and as far as I can tell, quite nice people. It's possible to be as smart and logical as someone else, and yet still have a differing opinion. We should be cautious of labels and understand that we can't all have everything we want for a platform that was built on the concept of decentralization.

If Bitmain attacked BTC with the plan being to get everyone to switch over to BCH, I guess the inevitable conclusion to those considering switching would be that Bitmain could simply do the same and attack BCH at some point in order to get everyone to move to a new Bitmain-nominated coin.
So I think in the event of an attack on BTC, it would be more likely that the community would be incensed and initiate rolling POW changes for BTC.

That mental instability is also what helped him go all-in back in bitcoin's early days, when very few people thought bitcoin would become what it is today. There are probably lots of unstable people who invested in things that didn't work out, but we just don't hear about them. 
More importantly though, I think attacks on bitcoin are useful in demonstrating its resilience. Evolution leads to better models due to evolutionary pressure.

Bitcoin has stood the test of time too. 9 years online while vulnerable to hackers and malicious actors. 
Any of the gemstones could conceivably replace gold purely as a store of value. They'd probably be easier to store and transport safely too. Yet we don't see gold's price falling significantly. I guess this is indicative that value comes from common agreement, not necessarily perceived technical superiority.

Think about expensive gemstones and artworks versus cheap replicas of these. The use cases can be pretty similar, but the value is vastly different because of a wider agreement on the value. If value can be agreed upon, then it exists.

I mean the national economy. We know that a spending stimulus can improve economic parameters, ie. if more people are spending in shops, then more shops are earning from the sales and this has a knock-on effect, with more investment and growth, etc. Hodling bitcoin has encouraged me to spend less overall, so I'm wondering about the effects of this sort of behaviour on a national scale.

@_date: 2017-11-28 01:37:45
A full coin is just an arbitrary value and has no actual functional difference to half a coin, or 5% of a coin. Think of it like buying gold dust. You don't need to buy a full ounce to own the gold. You can buy whatever amount you like. 5% of an ounce will still give you the security and per unit value of the gold dust. 
Now, think of bitcoin as gold dust, and think of LTC as lead dust. Yes, BTC is more expensive and LTC is cheaper. But there's a reason why one is more expensive than the other....

You're entitled to want no change. The issue here is that a party was arguing against proposed changes using a range of arguments, but omitted the one that was most likely to be the true motivation for opposition. If proposed changes affect us all, it's better that the wider and less-informed community can make a decision based on facts. You might not mind a bit of deception, but it clearly bothers many.

You may be right when you say the system is built on selfish miners, but that doesn't stop us trying to hold them accountable for their actions. However, I think altruism is not the goal here. 
Many people use bitcoin as a store of value without understanding how it works. The deception of the wider public here is the issue. It's like a politician during an election lying about their intentions, and then voters casting their vote for that person based on their lies. This doesn't automatically mean that the opposition party is correct. But it does mean that the integrity of the liar and the arguments they previously put forward are suspect.

@_date: 2018-02-12 03:31:23
Yes, but I think the point OP is making is that many of the newly minted coins are more likely to be sold quickly - to cover running costs for miners.  
There are many more coins out there in cold storage, but at least some of the hodlers are intent to keep hodling and not buying more. Coin price is a function of demand at a specific point in time.

Consider that the same would be true for any finite resource. It could be possible to borrow a large amount of gold, with the total amount to be repaid exceeding all the gold reserves in existence. But that's an unrealistic situation. It wouldn't be smart to lend such a large amount of gold (or bitcoin) to anyone. Such a contract could hypothetically be agreed upon and signed, but the physical improbability of payback would mean a default - and implies an unwise expectation on the part of the lender. 
And if instead you have many parties all lending smaller amounts of bitcoin to many different borrowers (such that the total amount of bitcoin to be repaid is more than what exists), then inevitably some proportion of the borrowers will default. In such a scenario, you'd also have intense competition among the borrowers to procure all the remaining bitcoin in order to repay their loans, thus driving up the price.

Hey, I have the exact same goal! I first invested in bitcoin because I believe in the concept and I admire it as a brave new coin. Then the price started skyrocketing around the same time I became interested in Tesla. A Tesla is too expensive for me at the moment, but I feel the price is worth it to support a great company and innovator. To buy a Tesla with the profits I make from bitcoin... that's just an extremely cool idea, and one that I'm aiming for. Might take a few years, but let's get Teslas!

I experienced a very similar issue with my Trezor today, although I'm not sure whether its specific to Trezor. 
I had 3 wallets created in my Trezor on my home computer (I hodl bitcoin for myself and for some friends who don't have cold storage). Last night I went to my friend's house to show him what the Trezor looks like and to transfer some bitcoin with it. He decided to move his bitcoin stash onto a newly created wallet on my Trezor. Everything went fine up until then.
When I got home (around 3 hours later), I reconnected my Trezor to check on the wallet balance and to rename his account (I use the Dropbox extension to allow account naming). Much to my surprise, I could not see the new account we had created, nor any trace of the transaction. 
A moment ago (8 hours after I left my friend's house), I just logged on again to see if anything had changed. I now have his correct balance sitting in the new account. So it seems that the transaction lagged, and/or that the balance and new account update for my Trezor also lagged. Mildly disconcerting. I can only recommend being patient. For what it's worth, I've been very happy with my Trezor otherwise.
