Hush, this community needs a transition to SRS values as much as Sendgrid needed donglegate. We should listen to the privilege checkers with zero bitcoin since our community will be enriched by their divisive values (you can see the fruits of infighting in this very comment thread). 
We too can be a community seized by internal squabbling, all we have to do is check our privilege and listen to the reddit colonialists seeking to impart their values on us.

Don't start drinking the poison people like Turk want to shove down your throats, it doesn't help anyone, just makes everything divisive and separated when Bitcoin is all about bringing us together. 
Key part of the article for me:
"How incredibly rude for Turk to assume she knows best for anyone, specifically a movement that is doing just fine without her gender politics.
She seeks to inject her brand of feminism into bitcoin, but it doesn’t belong there. If anything, feminists could take a cue from bitcoiners about how to treat people. Bitcoin is an idea that surpasses identity politics and offers tangible solutions to problems like poverty, and if Turk is arguing we need more enlightened women like her in bitcoin then she can stay far away.
Bitcoin needs feminism like a fish needs a bicycle. I would even say it has the potential to remedy perceived gender equality far better than what feminism has become."

They're implying women have no agency and thus had no choice in voluntarily accepting this job, in line with their patriarchy attack line.

I think something is wrong on their end, I'm also waiting on a dice roll from yesterday. If you look on their site the last bet to go through was from 15 hours ago. 
You always get something back, that's how they confirm the transaction has been resolved. You get either your risk wager if you rolled under the amount you bet, or like 0.0005BTC if you lose. 
It looks like a lot of bets are going through right now so the system is catching up. If you still don't get anything back in a while, send them an email with the transaction ID.

It's quite a generalization you've made to blame low involvement of women in Bitcoin on sex appeal based marketing. Surely you can put some evidence on the table for us all the evaluate?

Once you state it's your job to police free speech (not even offensive speech I might add), I conclude that you're the problem. I don't care that some snowflake felt oppressed at a Bitcoin meetup and I honestly doubt her honesty about what happened. 
Maybe since Bitcoin is so like, oppressive to her as a woman, she could partner up with Adria Richards to invent her own crypto currency?

IMO Bitcoins are a great investment that will no doubt yield large gains years from now but you need to understand you could lose everything if it crashes.

I was referring to the folding method. I don't contend that medical breakthroughs do not cost money, I was merely implying that cancer research organizations have the money to spend soliciting such services rather than expecting it for free as they currently do.
 It's basically bitcoin mining but they don't compensate you at all, it's all charity. What I was suggesting was something along the lines of paying people in Bitcoin in exchange for their hardware use. 
Trillions might have been hyperbole, but you have to admit there are huge pharmaceutical, medical and other organizations that make huge revenues from 'fighting' cancer without producing results. If these organizations really wanted to make a difference they would spend the money to do so rather than leaving it all up to altruism.

The huge scale of the DDOS points to someone with large enough resources to carry it out. This kind of attack which targeted pretty much everyone related to Bitcoin (even the mining pools) was not done by a small group of people.

You send money to the address associated with the odds you like. If you win, they'll send you back the wager x the odds. If you lose, they send you back fractions of a cent like 0.005 or something like that. That way you can rest assured the bet was received win or lose.
