Well statistically Satoshi  is a man and not a minority in the location he lives in.

Are you kidding? How secure is any other payment method? Cash credit cards get stolen all the time. Money is insecure, there is room for crypto currency  in the future, bitcoin seems as good as any.

Clearly not or you would understand there is more fraudulent credit card activity than there is ENTIRE bitcoin activity. just because you think you don't see the impact of that fraud dosen't meant that its free.

Assuming you reside in the United states you should look into small claims court, no lawyer required and you just need to fill out some paperwork. There is normally a maximum ammount for small claims court tho, in VA it's 5000.

While I disagree with the way you said it I don't actually disagree with your message. If the majority of your community is only there for the pump and dump it seems kind of pointless and ultimately like the tulip market or comics in the 90s

I'd be pretty happy to be paid in bitcoins

really some banks will drop you after transferring money to say coinbase? My bank did not, but its scary know that they could have.

Developing a solution to a 51% attack while bitcoin is still in its infancy rather than waiting and have someone or some agency steal billions later on

Why would you trade BTC as a paper wallet? It would be much easier to just load up your phone with however much you needed and make a transfer on the spot

well I think you have to do trust VS potential to track. So do I trust you enough to accept a piece of paper with a barcode VS actually being able to verify that you are giving me money. I mean you could always get burn smartphones for just the transactions. If i was a drug dealer I would totally accept BTC.

honestly I thought the point of a currency was to use it. Sure its great to have a savings of bitcoins, or any currency but really spend some of it. Ask your employer if he or she will accept bitcoins and that you would like to be paid in bitcoins. This may be turning into a rant but are bitcoins any good if all you use them for is turning them into cash?

Yes they are all bad. I kind of like litecoin because CPU mining is actually good

NMC, PPC, TRC are the 'big' ones
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:57:09
Well its good that they are willing to accept bitcoins but the way they are doing it is still a stumbling block. Wouldn't it be great if they actually had the wallet and what not and then went and sold them on their own, if that's what they are going to do any way, possibly pay their staff in bitcoins.

If im ever homeless I'm gonna do this.
HOMELESS NEED BTC

As the android user base is larger than the iOS user base I'd think so but I don't have an iOS device.
