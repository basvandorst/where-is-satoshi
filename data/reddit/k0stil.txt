Olegovich is paternal name. Oleg is his father's name. his surname is unknown from the article.
They also want to name their daughter (if they have one) - Dasha (after "Dash", also Dasha is actually a pretty normal Russian name) and their second son - Satoshi. 
he said the reasoning behind this is he is rich because of cryptos and wants to thank the crypto community by doing this

When core supporters started saying that it is not a payment system but a "store of value"/"digital gold", does it mean that bitcoin is not a cryptocurrency anymore? Because currency is supposed to be used and spent unlike "store of value". If its not a cryptocurrency, it should not be listed on coinmarketcap anymore

Thats actually be a good lifehack. Id say some ridiculous thing like "if ethereum is over 10k in 2017 ill eat my left nut", then it reaches 10k, i eat my left nut, put it in actual "cold storage", become a billionare cuz of eth gains, spend money on making my left intact near the right nut again and i live hapilly ever after

I dont see any buses or subways or light rails on BTC. Why are the fees high? Why are transactions so slow? When is it going to be fixed? Does anyone plan to fix it???

It makes rich get even richer. (And poor even more poor). That might make putin and his 90 billionaires-wallets more powerful but it won't make a difference for most ordinary people

Bullshit. Three people were arrested and will go to jail because they ran an exchange "without a bank's license", even though there is no crypto law yet and its impossible to geta license because according to russia law, cryptos dont exist. They also want cryptos to be availiable to "experienced" investors (people who have more than 1 million dollars). They want to ban mining for "ordinary" people and they want to tax cryptos.the meeting between buterin and putin was a big deal for buterin but not for putin. Putin mustve not even understood who he was and what ethereum/blockchain is. He is a crazy old dictator

i'm russian and use bitcoin. maybe i know better? there were talks about making it illegal but it was never illegal, nor legal. there was no law whatsoever regarding bitcoin, or cryptocurrencies. no one was jailed or had any penalties for using bitcoin. it was all just talk talk talk till last year untill they realised the potential and Putin met Buterin.
this "bitcoin ban" that wiki refers to is *almost* completely false because there was no law banning bitcoin, just speeches by politicians that meant nothing. there was never a law regarding bitcoin regulation
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:41:13
there are no criminal penalties using it. and never was in Russia
