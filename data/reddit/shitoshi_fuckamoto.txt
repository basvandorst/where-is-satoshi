If your money isn't portable you can't have a global economy based on it (your reference to a prehistoric ledger is just ridiculous). If it's not acceptable it can't compete with other currencies and will lose value over time. There's no such thing as 'unmanipulable supply', it either is limited by design or it will be manipulated by some private interest sooner or later. 
I think you're the one not understanding any of the subjects in depth, you're not even giving counterarguments, just immaturely replying "no, it's not" and "stop repeating what other people said". 
There are other scaling strategies other than incrementing the block size limit, you should definitely inform yourself a bit more.

Well explained, I guess one can add as much phases as needed to squeeze more and more blocks, is that right?

Pruned nodes are equal to archival nodes in terms of security (they hold a fully verified chain). The only difference is archival nodes keep a full historical record of transactions, which are not required for full verification thanks to the merkle root in each block.

No, 'pruned' chains are exactly the same as 'non-pruned' chains, they're fully verifiable, bitcoind does the same thing with both. Only the block header is important, if it's correct then is verified.

Did you read my question at all? Let me state it more clear, how do you verify any given output without verifying the whole chain of blocks ending with the block containing the transaction referenced by the output including the outputs referenced by the inputs? Doing it backwards like you would if you fetched a list of utxos is less efficient than starting from genesis and verifying forward.

First, there's no need for a while loop, simple arithmetic is enough:
    transactionFee += Math.ceil((targetTransactionFee - transactionFee) 
        / this._defaultTXFee) * this._defaultTXFee
Second, I have a hard time guessing why you would possibly want to do that, given that targetTransactionFee should already be holding the final transaction fee you want to use (why you guesstimate it and then round it up?).
This code was produced by a programmer without experience and shouldn't be taken seriously.

I think you should. Mowing the lawn serves a two-fold purpose. First, the cosmetic benefits can be noticed immediately. A properly cut lawn is something that is very pleasant to behold. Mowing the lawn on a regular basis helps keep the grass short, neat and even. This also gives your lawn a very well manicured and orderly appearance. Many people consider it to be a matter of pride when it comes to the way that their yard looks; so tending to it in this fashion brings satisfaction.

I believe there's no going back to the "de facto alignment of interests" that once the user base enjoyed and honestly I think the same entanglement that is preventing us from agreeing is what makes it way more hard to launch attacks like embrace, extend and extinguish or ideological attrition warfare against us. Soft forks may have very similar practical effects to hard forks (even if they are way less optimal in technical terms) but they have the advantage of not touching the existing consensus rules, respecting the interests of all pre-existing users. Also directed hard forks set down a very dangerous precedent, a slippery slope in terms of trust for some of us.

If not for a critical security fix (and even in that case I doubt bitcoin can retain its value) there's practically no way to attain this without heavy usage of politics, FUD, etc. Bitcoin to me means exactly the opposite and you know I'm not the only one thinking this.

Segwit has witness programs which accomplish the same thing. The bitcoin community is politically more fragmented than ethereum's, thus making it way more difficult to coordinate. Increasing blockspace availability is contentious as that would increase the requirements to host a full node, leaving many of us out of the game.

Actually the oposite is true, LN can be done without segwit but it can't scale without packing more transactions in blocks. Anyway, miners are not probably against LN, as blockspace price will go up if demand surges like we're seeing right now. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 22:31:27
No, I'm not confusing it. I'm saying that miners will (or at least they rationally should) adjust the size of the blocks they build to maximise the amount in fees they get. That doesn't necessarily mean including every transaction, but actually finding how much money are we willing to pay for blockspace (by limiting it). LN has nothing to do with block economics, they will be as valid then as they are today.

That's not true, LN nodes need to eventually settle in order to provide liquidity to establish new channels. Also there's the opening transaction, which is done also on-chain. It is completely wrong that the amount of bitcoin that miners collect in fees is somehow in relation with the amount of txs they put in a block. As I said before, blockspace price will keep on surging as far as there is growing pressure to settle on-chain.

You actually don't know if it was one guy or a group, and maybe you also don't know some consensus rules were decided after the initial release, introduced as soft-forks. Obviously it gets harder and harder to introduce changes as more people join and run software, but there's no rational argument against introducing more features if the majority of the network finds it convenient. Actually, blocking any change just because "attaining consensus is dangerous" is pretty naive and oversimplifies the problem. Again, bad news for you, miners attain consensus all the time, they meet and decide stuff on a periodic basis, and there's nothing users and full-node operators like us can do about it.

You seem to think that by blocking change we can effectively block fork proposals but that's simply wrong, emergency hard-forks have happened and will most likely happen again and the network effect of bitcoin can only attract *so much* users (who look for utility, not ideology). Now, there's two ways to go about this, block every change and become obsolete, or being open to soft-forks, improve the software slowly, review code thoroughly and find a middle ground that involves not touching critical rules like currency emission rate and friends.

Hardforks should be avoided at any cost, just look what happened to ethereum, which was planned, announced and executed with a supermajority of miners.

So please tell me, what hardforks does flexible transactions help avoid in the future that segwit doesn't?
@_date: 2016-11-25 22:15:44
That depends on how much transactions are waiting in the mempool, if no transactions are waiting in the mempool, then miners will build smaller blocks until blockspace price pays for the cost of building such block plus a margin profit. With subsidies going down and no longer covering mining costs, blockspace price must go up accordingly.
@_date: 2016-11-25 16:12:53
Do you have an alternative explanation for such a sudden demand of blockspace?
@_date: 2016-11-25 21:22:49
Because not all settlements will fit in a block, therefore LN nodes will compete with fees to settle, and they need to do it on a regular basis to keep operating. Miners do care about the pressure to transact, is not the same if you can choose to not transact or to do it using a different payment method than if you absolutely must do it because your business depends on it (LN nodes). Actually that's why RBF was put in place, so LN nodes can bump their fees without artificially inflating the mempool.

Bigger blocks are only a side effect of segwit, when you place the signatures outside of the blocks, you gain more space for other things.

@_date: 2016-12-07 10:14:53

No, it's not. If you also think you can use bitcoin as often and quick as fiat you're deluded and use bitcoin for the wrong reason.

I'm talking about bitcoin specifically, not about the theoretical capabilities of cryptocurrencies.

So much interest, it made the price decrease.

32 dollars are nothing when we're taking about a 750 dollar asset.
@_date: 2017-01-20 18:06:53
And what they will do, abuse it until they destroy its utility? That would be just stupid, given how deep are they invested in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-10 23:32:28
Main chain will still be used for spending miner subsidies (decreasing reward + increasing fees) in any case.
@_date: 2016-12-28 00:49:33
0 transaction fees.
@_date: 2016-12-12 16:02:23
On-chain transactions need to become much more expensive so miners can keep incrementing difficulty, and I guess they would due the limited block space available and the pressure coming from the absolute need to settle on-chain. These big fees would be collected from LN users but individually they won't be paying more than today, in any case much less.
@_date: 2016-11-26 14:42:07

@_date: 2016-11-25 00:18:25
It is indeed very bursty to be natural growth. Transaction type and fee variance can be easily generated pseudorandomly.

Any publicity.
@_date: 2016-12-06 23:30:49
The transaction backlog doesn't represent potential demand, just current demand. On 2010 bitcoin was more of an experiment, remarkable but untested software with very little guarantees. Nowadays bitcoin has demonstrated to be a stable and secure network and platform, things have changed a lot, it could have been very attractive to store assets if it wasn't limited and expensive due the fee market.

@_date: 2016-11-25 21:13:31
The miners would get paid because blockspace price will surge due the increase of demand, the pressure to settle is way bigger than the pressure to buy coffee with bitcoin.

Nope, it depends a lot about what lottery you're talking about but most of them give you a relatively high chance (in contrast with bitcoin's case). In popular culture though, lottery is known as the "stupidity tax" for a reason.
@_date: 2016-12-04 21:24:13
It does matter a lot, soft-forks are backwards compatible consensus changes, unlike hard-forks. You cannot be understanding how bitcoin's consensus works, suggest soft-forks are equally risky to hard-forks and pretend to not be spreading FUD; one of the previous premises must be false.
@_date: 2016-11-25 20:53:01
Yeah but that is only a side effect of segwit (and actually somebody calculated that segwit blockspace gains are not enough for a reasonable amount of settlements). I personally don't care about both sides of the "debate", just telling how it is.
@_date: 2016-12-05 17:14:53
@_date: 2016-11-25 11:04:18
Of course it was, but that doesn't make it suitable for the task (at least right now). You can continue with your "what if" campfire stories but in reality there's no such alternative currency that does both, the ones that are private enough lack decentralization.
@_date: 2016-12-04 22:10:28
Machine-coded consensus was agreed by humans in first place, you're walking in circles.

The good thing is that it doesn't matter what users want. Soon a group of miners with enough hash rate will get extension blocks up and running.
@_date: 2017-04-02 23:54:53

You're right, and now I am even more confused about the UASF strategy, how is running a bitcoin node that is constantly forking the main chain a viable solution?
@_date: 2017-04-07 16:14:15
UASF nodes refuse to accept blocks that do not signal segwit, that doesn't sound very backwards compatible imho.
@_date: 2017-04-07 15:31:23
Code can be patched, but that's not the subject of this thread. Segwit is fantastic, but sadly doesn't look like miners will adopt it, so we can just hope the second best thing happens which is extension blocks. Thanks for the advice.
@_date: 2017-04-26 15:52:23


From [wikipedia](


AFAIK, bcoin has achieved 100% compatibility (bug by bug) with core,  and it uses native bindings (secp256k1, leveldb) where necessary.
While is true that js has some gotchas (which daily js programmers avoid with ease), bcoin's codebase is pretty compact and well constructed, you should give it a closer look.
@_date: 2017-04-07 16:26:03

Users can't decide at all, we're learning this the hard way.
@_date: 2017-04-09 13:15:39
As users we should be putting the pressure on exchanges, instead of miners. Miners don't care about users, just about liquidity on exchanges in order to pay for their bills.
@_date: 2017-04-03 09:16:38
Perhaps secured by POS on the main chain? I don't expect miners to collaborate with merged mining.
@_date: 2017-04-02 17:50:02
Wouldn't UASF provoke a hard fork, effectively dropping hash rate?

Increasing profit is not misbehaving, it's instead exactly what we should expect from miners, competition fuels progress, progress increments security.

At least it won't be polluting the coinbase transaction, instead of going in the block header as it should. Perhaps the amount of lines of code required to implement it as a hard fork would be roughly the same, but at least it would be simpler in terms of semantics, which do increase the learning curve for future developers. Care to explain why you think it's *cleaner* as a soft fork?
@_date: 2017-04-09 17:49:24
How so? At minimum it would have saved some space in the coinbase and most likely it would have been way simpler to implement.
@_date: 2017-04-07 17:15:34

@_date: 2017-04-08 23:51:51
Well, actually segwit blocks will not be able to accommodate all the transactions that a widespread use of lightning network will require, therefore I think the extension blocks proposal will be properly developed, implemented and activated anyway, whatever the state of segwit activation may be.

@_date: 2017-04-26 21:19:28

They took the risk to do it after public announcement, that's their choice, and perhaps a clever one. Only time will tell.
@_date: 2017-04-02 22:49:19
When their blocks start to get rejected, I expect BU miners to patch bitcoin so it sticks to their chain, and proceed to bring online more hashing power to overcome the 51% attack, while both chains will slow down considerably.

Is not about how much people mine, is about how much energy is currently spent and how much money has been invested in hardware. Currently miners have invested millions in hardware and are using massive amounts of energy, changing the POW algorithm will leave them with huge losses and tons of garbage that nobody will buy.

@_date: 2016-09-08 04:11:48
Bittorrent without trackers uses the DHT, but the first time you start the client you need to query a few well known  nodes to bootstrap (bitcoin used IRC for this and now just DNS) and only then can it discover new nodes. Then there's the problem of authentication, which is partially solved by schemes like the PGP web of trust but still a bit complex for non technical users.
@_date: 2016-09-05 23:28:49
Those are no cryptographic hash functions at all, nevermind, I thought you had something to say to support your claim.

@_date: 2016-09-06 00:16:32
So what? It has been (and still is) thoroughly tested by cryptanalysts all around the world and no practical preimage attacks have been successfully performed on it. See, it doesn't matter who developed it at all, it's a well known open algorithm and anybody can analyse it.

Spending an output reveals your public key, which diminishes your security if you were to use that address again. Quoting Pieter Wuille,  with relation to the choice of using public key hashes (the only publicly known information before spending):


So yeah, reusing addresses seems to be objectively worst than not doing it.

You're wrong, after a softfork, the majority of miners enforce the new rules; you can't perform a double spend attack the same way you can't spend from 'anybody can spend' outputs that segwit uses, there are extra rules added to the consensus that prevent anybody from doing so.
