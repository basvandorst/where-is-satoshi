Bitcoin is a great coin to hold, no doubt. But if you want a higher return, altcoin is key. There are several altcoin in the space, that's why one needs to make some research before taking a decision. I would advise that MPCX is considered in making research, because I consider the project to be of great potential and she's holding her IEO presently in OOOBTC and PROBIT exchange at less than 5 cents where the several incentives is considered.

Its better to consider various options before making an investment and I think it's good to consider some projects in their infancy with good potential like MPCX, a digital wealth management platform who recently secured partnership with IBM and WIZZLE lately and has other partnership with blue chip companies. I believe that this project is a great source of investment and should be considered in making an investing decision.

A great approach of investment is by diversifying your portfolio to include projects that are of great potential and still upcoming. A good buy is MPCX who has a partnership with IBM and would be holding its IEO on OOBTC exchange and PROBIT exchange on the 28TH OF JUNE, 2019. The token would be sold for only 6 cents.

The Bitcoin rally has been trending for a while now and i'm yet to understand what necessitated the bull run for bitcoin. Some persons attributed it to the facebook coin - LIBRA. And some said its because of the partnership which MPCX secured with IBM. It's quite fortunate that MPCX is also having a tokensale running presently on OOOBTC AND PROBIT EXCHANGE and the tokens have the capacity to give one an unbelievable percentage of investment return because the team is loaded with experience in investment and knowledgeable to the core.
