EVIDENCE that Bitfinex is committing theft, through the socialized losses, when only unique individual private wallets were hacked.


bitcoins were supposedly "legally" delivered to the customers. Bitfinex did this to comply with the CFTC's order regarding delivery of bitcoins to customers.

if they arbitrarily do this and spread the losses from some traders to others than their "individualized account" defence to liability will be completely contradicted. 
These actions would contradict the unique account separations and make them responsible for the full 120k BTC since the separation would be seen as a farce that they faked for the CFTC.

It would be impossible to sell 120k bitcoins for $604 without MAJOR slippage. Bitfinex is stealing money from anyone who had USD on their exchange in two ways:
1) The USD were owned by individuals who were not at risk of losing any bitcoins and in fact no USD was lost, therefore they should not have to lose anything at all.
2) People with USD are being "charged" for 120k bitcoins at the price of $604 each, which is a ridiculous price, since it could never happen in the real market without enormous downward slippage. If someone had to market dump 120k bitcoins they would be lucky to get $300 per coin.
TLDR: Bitfinex is stealing USD from people in order to give preferential treatment to former bitcoin holders, and paying them USD for their bitcoins which in actual fact is not even close to the value of said asset. Its like paying $100 per pound of manure, for a million pounds of manure, when in fact the market demand for manure is a hundred pounds of manure total, once those few pounds are supplied the price goes down since no one else wants it, yet bitfinex is forcing users to buy all of it at a nonsensical price which is not based on reality or the market...
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:32:16


I think they are running for that defence (based on the wording of all their responses and status updates), this way they wont become bankrupt and it will be akin to your safety deposit box getting broken into rather than them being responsible for the funds.
But they need to make sure they treat each account as  a unqiue safety deposit box or they will contradict their claim. You cant have socialized losses between different peoples safety deposit boxes XD
That would make no sense...

wow that would be awesome for those who lent BTC, they will make serious money if they are repaid in FIAT at $604 pricing rather than BTC. 
I suspect that Bitfinex would instead:
1) take the $604 from the shorters, 
2)buy some BTC for current market prices somewhere else, 
3) return the exact amount of Bitcoins to the lenders who lent BTC.
4) pocket the difference. 
Basically they will force shorts to buy bitcoins for well above market price, from who though? themselves? So they will profit off this hack and pocket it?

Bitfinex recently stated that they have around 7 Million dollars worth of funds still left.
They also stated that they did not take a 36% haircut of their funds.
So Bitfinex , were any of those funds in bitcoins that were hacked? You did not take a 36% cut from your 7 million dollars, instead you simply took funds from customers and then paid yourselves 100% of your losses...
What the actual F**K!!!?
RELEASE THE BOOKS AND HAVE A THIRD PARTY AUDIT THEM!
The delay is probably them editing/cooking their current books to cover up this massive theft. If they do so (and create fictitious "customer trading accounts" that "got hacked") they will also be able to issue themselves additional BFXtokens (current estimate is up to 7 million tokens to themselves or their "fictitious accounts" that they are likely creating to try cover up their theft).
lets say they had all 7 million dollars worth in bitcoins, they will have to create fake trading accounts that supposedly suffered $19,444,444.44 worth or 32192.78-BTC that were stolen in order to then take 7 million dollars worth of bitcoins from their customers.
The truth is simple and wouldnt require excuses and time hurdles in order to explain to customers why they are being robbed 36%...
However lies will take them much time and effort to create, hence the major delays regarding them releasing data related to their theft, since this kind of data could easily be used against them and if they screw up even one detail people will probably find it!
STEALING UP TO AN EXTRA 3.6% (A TENTH OF THE ENTIRE AMOUNT HACKED) FROM EVERY SINGLE CUSTOMER IS COMPLETE BULLSHIT AND THEFT!!!

@_date: 2016-08-04 01:12:37
Thanks to the CFTC they changed their entire system, and no longer had the funds tied up between multiple accounts, instead they "always" transferred every transaction to individualized accounts. Each margin long or short had the funds/btc transferred to a new unique account. 
They did this in order to not be trading "futures" but to actually "deliver" real goods, not just promise to deliver which was what the CFTC had fined them for.
so unless they lied to the CFTC it should be pretty clear who owns what and who got hacked etc.
@_date: 2016-08-07 10:32:57
Well thats nothing to do with BVI , but I agree, most deposits are not FDIC insured.
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:50:30
ah, so this will hurt the USD lenders rather than the traders who borrowed USD from them. I see. This really only makes sense though for actual bitcoins that were stolen, since they were hacked at the $604 price and thus that is price for each bitcoin that was lost. For open positions that werent hacked it doesnt really make sense to close them at non-current-market price (without having actual buyers to swap their FIAT for the longed BTC).
Anyway the math only makes sense if they lost basically all margin longs and there are close to an equal amount of shorts. Otherwise someone will have to actually buy the bitcoins for way above current market. Who will this be and why will they do it?
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:47:20
This would mean that the accounts werent "individualized" as they were claiming, and instead they will take socialized losses from shorts and give them to longs as some sort of admin decision. 
the reason I say this is because if they were individualized accounts, then long accounts would be holding (literally) Bitcoins in a unique address, and shorts would also be literally holding USD in a unique address. 
Now the market price has changed and if there is no reason to close any of those positions due to liquidations then the staff would be "hijacking trading positions" and selling them at any price they feel like. They could force shorts to pay $1k per coin if they felt like it. They would only be able to justify these actions if they agreed to the claim that the positions weren't 100% the individuals's but rather the exchanges, and that they can decide on arbitrary trading decisions in certain events to counter other traders's losses.
This would be an admission and evidence that accounts were not actually individualized in practice although they tried to simply make it appear that way (by creating "individual wallets/accounts" but completely disregarding the actual seperation of accounts). 
If they do this they would be contradicting their claims as to why they would not be liable for the 120k coins since the accounts would be proven to not be individualized. Dunno if they should risk doing such actions without seeking legal advice, and even then courts might disagree with their advice. 
Best approach would be to interfere as little as possible with different trading accounts and then use this as proof they keep each account separate from the rest unless they have to step in and liquidate certain positions, these would be the one understandable exception.

@_date: 2016-08-04 01:19:03
I am arguing that they had better not interfere with "unique individualized accounts" because this is their main defence about why they arent liable for the 120k coin hack.
Once they start touching and playing with market positions for no good reason (obviously they can liquidate some positions as this would be reasonable), then they will be demonstrating that they actually do not consider the accounts/positions completely separate from each other, and that they can arbitrarily make decisions to create socialized losses.
This would make them liable for the full 120k and would thus make them bankrupt, as their actions would be evidence that the "individualized system" was a farce created simply to fool the CFTC.

by FBI he probably means that he filled out one of their "File a complaint" cyber internet crime report form. Not any actual direct connection.
FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3): 
What probably happened:
1) Bitfinex takes two minutes to fill out the FBI cyber complaint form after users want to know if they contacted any law enforcement, they simply write that $70 million dollars was lost. 
2) Bitfinex sends their spokesman to reddit to write that the FBI are now totally involved (why not also send some snail mail from hong kong to the USA to also be able to say the FBI have been "notified" in writing, although it would only arrive at some later point...).
3) Also Zane confirms that it for sure was not an inside job. 
4) They conveniently forget to mention dates and times, that it probably took a few days and for users question them regarding law enforcement involvement before they filled out the Cyber online complaint form (why contact them directly? right? we just need to be able to announce our contact, not actually have a real connection in a timely fashion), that will likely be viewed by the FBI secretaries within a few weeks/months, and if they get lucky it might even get passed on to some higher ups, if it doesnt get lost in the their spam folder.

For those positions only. Otherwise they will be arbitrarily taking control of traders's positions in order to socialize other traders' losses.

How will all margin longs be closed at $604? Where will the money to "purchase" the coins come from??? eg. If someone was holding 10k bitcoins on margin long, they were actually holding real bitcoins rather than USD (although they wouldnt be able to withdraw them of course), where will the USD come from (if you close the position) and what will you do with the BTC??? 
Like right now who would pay $6.04 million dollars for that many bitcoins if they can buy them cheaper elsewhere? Will bitfinex themselves buy the bitcoins for $604 and keep the bitcoins for themselves? Or will you force shorts and longs to close on each other at $604? That would of course benefit longs since the market price has changed significantly since bitfinex went offline. It would sort of be transferring free wealth from the shorts to the longs. 
Doesnt really make much sense to use outdated market prices on positions that dont need to auto close and thus close all margin positions at $604...?

The New York Times reports that the United States may have flubbed Snowden’s case when it failed to revoke his passport. Former federal prosecutor David Laufman told the newspaper that the passport should have been revoked after charges were filed against Snowden on June 14. The United States did revoke Snowden’s passport on Saturday, but it was unclear if Hong Kong authorities were aware of the move or if it mattered because Snowden reportedly had special refugee travel documents from Ecuador arranged by WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Attorney General Eric Holder had placed a call to his counterpart in Hong Kong on June 19 to stress the importance of extradition, and the United States had asked whether any additional documents were needed two days before, the Washington Post reports. Hong Kong requested more information on Friday, and U.S. officials were preparing the response when Snowden left for Russia.
“The request for the fugitive’s arrest for purposes of his extradition complied with all of the requirements of the U.S.–Hong Kong Surrender Agreement,” the DOJ spokesperson said. “At no point, in all of our discussions through Friday, did the authorities in Hong Kong raise any issues regarding the sufficiency of the U.S.’s provisional arrest request. In light of this, we find their decision to be particularly troubling.”
On June 19 (or June 20 in Hong Kong), Attorney General Eric Holder called Hong Kong Secretary for Justice Rimsky Yuen and encouraged him to comply with the U.S. request for Snowden’s extradition.
A day later, Hong Kong authorities requested additional information about the U.S. charges and the evidence against Snowden.
U.S. authorities were in the process of responding to the request when Hong Kong authorities allowed Snowden to fly to Moscow on Sunday. Later that day, U.S. officials were notified that their request for Snowden’s extradition was found insufficient.

Yes the withdrawal system was where they got hacked, so they need to secure it before they ever consider coming back online. 
However they still havnt decided as to how the losses will be calculated. This seems to be what he has repeatedly told you.

You are underestimating the centralised currency systems, they are likely completely reversible within certain periods of time. Especially when authorities are tipped off in advance that the wires may be questionable. 
Yes they can attempt to run off with the remaining crypto deposits, but the FIAT is easily trapped. I think you are so used to bitcoin you dont realize just how crappy the legacy FIAT system is.
Again, once the FIAT is frozen , they will have a complete meltdown like many other exchanges did when this happened to them.


Thieves always try to plan their crimes to the best of their abilities, for now the fact that they are completely withholding all info, is more than just suspicious. If they really had planned this out better they would have a version of events supported by data and they would stick with it. 
Their actions fit those of a bunch of stooges trying to create last minute narratives of fiction, rather than tell the truth. You have way too much faith in them, doesnt seem like you have any objective reasons to support your views either.

I agree 25k, 1 penny, $604, all arbitrary numbers that dont reflect reality nor market prices. 
Courts should step in and make properly reasoned decisions. Might be less, or might be more, but the bitfinex incompetent clowns, shouldnt be playing god.
The courts would likely rule that the customers with FIAT deposits never agreed to be responsible for BTC hacks and that they were owned by individuals without any connection in any way to those who suffered BTC losses. Especially since there is supposedly evidence that Bitfinex gave to the CFTC to support this narrative of individualized accounts and funds/goods being legally "delivered" to the customers each day.
Additionally the courts might also find that the value of the bitcoin was quite different to the arbitrary $604 x 120k BTC that bitfinex arbitrarily decided on. Maybe they will say they have no value at all or were worth pennies. Pump and dump manipulation prices might not reflect reality.
The exchange owner might be getting a percentage of the socialized settlement from someone who lost millions in the hack and is now paying the exchange owner to make a decision that will steal from others in order for both of them to profit.

Well they messed with the CFTC and made fraudulent submissions to them, so making a few whales happy wont stop the US government from chasing them down. All the Gov needs is one user who is unhappy and they have a case against everyone involved in Bitfinex.
Also they will lose their cash cow which might be worth more than the loss. Additionally they have other options like sticking to the individualized losses narrative and keeping their business.

Why would you close margin long and margin short positions that arent at risk of liquidation? 
Who will pay the $604 per margin long bitcoin in order to close those positions? thats well above current market pricing.
Wouldnt it be proper to only step in and settle positions of those accounts that had their bitcoins hacked? Why would such arbitrary actions be taken for other trading positions if there is no need to step in and settle?
 The market should settle itself when you come back online.

Another point for those thinking of playing with these scamcoins. 
here are the current even odds when compared to BTC:
1) for bitcoin to go to $1500 (or more, there isnt a cap on the price either) vs $0.
2) For bitfinex to pay $1 per BFX token (MAX) vs $0.
Ask yourselves if you want to bet on
A) bitfinex not going bankrupt/having their bank accounts frozen by a court ordered injunction which will ruin them/another hacking/many-other-doomsday-scenarios   
B) having your investment in BTC in cold storage/hardware wallet (trezor recommended).
Seems like a no brainer. 
Edit: this seems to be how bitfinex came up with the Idea for their scam tokens:

I made this thread yesterday regarding bitfinex and made certain allegations:
1) they delayed any release of information so they could "cook their books" ie. they had something to hide and they needed time to fake their records.
2) they had their customers pay for their companies own bitcoin losses, by creating fake "trading accounts" and pretending that their companies bitcoin assets were actually owned by "traders" who were hacked. This way they could claim socialized losses rather than simply say that some of their own coins were stolen and gone for good. This would also mean that they owned a significant amount of BFXcoins.
They responded to my thread through an announcement on their website admitting to these allegations:
1) weeks after the hack they are only now in discussions with an unqualified auditor. (obviously this should have been arranged at the time of the haircut...)


2) They admitted that 2 of the top 10 BFXcoin holders are "their staff" , which was exactly what was expected/predicted.


@_date: 2016-08-16 02:04:55
They credited back $604 USD per bitcoin that was taken, so they dont need to buy any coins.

I know many people want to hush it all up but that just isnt going to happen.

made up numbers. Its an open and shut case. summary judgement.

Outright stealing $7 million dollars from customers is something to be concerned about. Its called embezzlement.
@_date: 2016-08-07 10:45:43
The users personal bank accounts are not owned by bitfinex, neither are the crypto currency private wallets. 
They cant unilaterally steal from users because 75% of users say that its ok. 
The only reason they can even have access to users' accounts is solely to liquidate assets if a user is margin called. Otherwise, without this reason, if they touch these funds, without user consent, they will be committing theft, plain and simple.
@_date: 2016-08-17 05:57:34

1) sidechains can use either a different crypto or some other layer built on bitcoin (not yet completed, nor necessarily safe as they would need to be incredibly secure to avoid different kinds of attacks). 
2) simple is always better. Just buy a larger hard drive. the end. no sidechains 3rd parties needed.
3) Sabotage doesnt have to mean completely destroying something as you seem to have incorrectly interpreted it. Artificially limiting the blocksize is sabotaging the network and would be financially catastrophic if that was the end of their plan, however they are banking on people being forced to use their services once they are priced out of the bitcoin blockchain. 
4) people would be forced to either use fully centralised wallets like coinbase to avoid transfer fees, or probably use some sort of pegged altcoin through blockstream (for a fee) in order to send bitcoins. That is what I mean by middlemen. It is unnecessarily complicated just so a middleman can get a cut.

Regardless Dave Kleiman died in 2013 and its been 15 months since then, so as the sole shareholder Craig Wright can do whatever he wants.

The reason Craig Wright keeps repeating he will not accept any financial or non-financial gain is likely because that would be illegal and he would end up in prison.

So basically stalling for 24-72 hours so he can flee the country.
@_date: 2016-05-04 01:32:56
probably paid gavin a decent sum of money that he cannot talk about and also had him sign some legal document testifying that craig wright is satoshi.
Probably going to use these documents in court as part of his scam.
@_date: 2016-05-04 01:49:08
Can confirm, he pulled off this entire charade to try recruit people to enroll in this course.
@_date: 2016-05-04 10:55:27
Doubt he could bribe the ATO. It doesnt work that way for such large investigations. 
However I do agree he seems to be trying to fool them.

lol nice writeup. It is quite amazing that he conned gavin and other top bitcoin names.
Also check out: 
@_date: 2016-05-06 03:37:23
proof please?
Regardless even if you were to support your claims, he already signed blocks 0 and 9 (for gavin). So the whole trust thing is no longer a valid excuse.

I seem to recall he already claimed that he lent bitcoins to himself to pay for software that he would give to his companies. No transaction would be necessary as he could just "transfer the private keys".
Edit: "If you look at page 9, there is a description of how Hotwire was funded via bitcoin from Craig, and then used that bitcoin to purchase IP rights from the Wright Family Trust. That trust itself had received the IP from Craig. "

@_date: 2016-05-06 00:36:09
This is complete BULLSHIT. The trust was dissolved 15 months after kleiman died (died 2013). There is no longer a 2020 date. Read the alleged contract...
If there even exists such a trust Craig Wright is now the sole owner of the coins and may use them at his discretion:
The contract stipulates that if Kleiman should die, “Dr Wright will be returned shares in the Tulip trust and company 15 months after my death at his discretion.”
 Dave Kleiman (1967 – April 26, 2013)
Lastly the fact that he allegedly signed messages from the genesis block and block 9 shows that he doesnt need anything from this so called trust to access any coins. Its all lies and deceptions. craig has screwed himself over with his web of lies.

Well if the coins are in a trust that he doesnt control then he wont have the details on him. However this wont stop people kidnapping (him or his family) and extorting him. He is likely in mortal danger , same as any USA president, except they have massive government budgets for their security.
@_date: 2016-05-03 00:23:40
Gavin suggested that what may have motivated Craig to come forward was the fact that he somehow got the repuation of being a con artist and scammer and he did not want to leave this as his legacy in life. 
Well right now he looks to be an even bigger con artist, soon his name will appear on every news paper and he will go down in history as a major fraudster.
If he did have the keys and wasnt lying on tv he would release a signature ASAP. Otherwise RIP any legacy aspirations he has ever had, his family name will be tainted forever.
@_date: 2016-05-04 00:01:11
He has put a 500 million dollar bounty on his head. I dont think he can blend in anywhere at this point. 
eg. going to the mall will require more security than the president of the USA.
@_date: 2016-05-03 22:56:11
he might never have owned the coins either and it might all be one big scam.
once we start playing with "what ifs" theres no limits.

No one fucking cares. 
Move the blocks then have a discussion or GTFO.

If he posted like a normal sane person it would have been short and sweet. Instead he posted some fake information on his blog and has the tax authorities investigating him for $54 million dollar fraud. 
Here is an example of how he should have done the reveal: 
@_date: 2016-05-02 13:18:54
How about we wait and hold off on any judgments, to see if C. Wright will publish an actual signature with his name+date or something similar to that.

If faking a bitcoin signature to prove that you are satoshi isnt a "reasonable doubt" what is?
@_date: 2016-05-03 03:16:03
@_date: 2016-05-03 10:31:51
Because he might inadvertently get some advantage before he has the chance to decline it and then potentially be liable for a prison sentence of up to 10 years. 
Therefore he is trying to avoid being held accountable by repeating multiple times that he does not want any gains from his lies, deception and dishonestly. 
This way if he does get any benefits, he can try claim that it was completely unintentional.

if it costs them only $400 to mine each bitcoin why the heck wouldnt they increase their operations? 
They are literally making boatloads of money off speculators. The cost of production is just that far below sale price.
They should 10x or 100x their operation!
@_date: 2016-07-07 05:28:34
2x $200 = $400
and if it doesnt hold even that price, then the difficulty will have to go lower, there will likely be some traffic jams on the blockchain for a few weeks or so though.
