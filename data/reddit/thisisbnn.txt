When this happened two years ago in Cyprus, BTC prices tripled within a couple of weeks.

Trezor is pretty good. I'd check them out. If you have BTC to save and not use on a daily basis, that's probably best combo of safety and convenience

I have. They will ship out at an indeterminate date this summer. Not sure if they are waiting for all 1000 to be sold, or are still building them.
And they accept Bitcoin. I haven't seen or heard of a better wallet anywhere

If the US Dollar collapsed, then yes this could happen. That is the only way. 
The chances of the plug being pulled on the Dollar as the World's Reserve Currency within a year are slim. 
Possible, but highly unlikely
@_date: 2014-11-29 23:02:51
Except if the USD didn't have any real value, and couldn't pay for jack squat anymore. Then you might have a problem.
And how would you have a job with no dollar value, make money, feed yourself, what retirement account? You could stay in your house, since there would be no real currency to pay processors/lawyers/judges/repo men. But the cops/firemen/judges wouldn't get paid either, so anyone with a weapon could walk in and steal your food/possessions or destroy/burn down your house.

Considering the fact that the USD is the "world's reserve currency", and many countries use it as their official currency, and many Americans will still accept it even after it has "crashed", it would take months, probably years for it to lose ALL of its value. The dollar has value now because 1. You have been trained to believe it has value. 2. The government will only accept it for payment of taxes.
WHEN the dollar collapses, the U.S. government will probably force it's tax slaves into another scam fiat currency like the SDR. Will The People fall for a new scam currency? Will they move to Bitcoin? Will they use SDRs, or else?
Since the dollar WILL collapse, and the dollar has never done it before, it will be a brave new world in America when this eventually takes place. The rest of the nation-states of the world know how a currency collapse works, since every currency except the world's reserve currency has collapsed or been replaced.
The U.S. will not be a great place to holiday when this happens. No.

I've known people who are bankers in this current system. They're just building a profile on you to find out what they can sell to you down the line. In this case, it's business. Nothing personal.

The Dollar wouldn't go from $1 to $0.00 overnight. BTC's value would still be rated against the declining dollar, as a point of reference. The dollar could lose 60-70% of it's value in a week, but it may never got $0.00 in value. There will always be Americans who will accept it, because they don't know any better. 
Dollars get their value from demand, and there will always be demand for dollars, at least in the U.S., so BTC can still easily be rated against it. It's not like Wall Street won't know what the dollar's value will be after a collapse. The rate of inflation can always be tracked and projected.
6 months after a collapse, Satoshis or millibitcoins will have an established street value, similar to dollars or pennies in value. It would take a few months of bartering, but we'd figure it out, and forget about the dollar value altogether. 
The dollar will always retain some value, if a penny, just as a known measure of value. 10 millibitcoins is equal to one USD. A cottage industry will form in Bitcoin valuation without dollars. Find a niche and fill that space!

No one has dominion over Bitcoin, or the Internet. Anyone who tells you they do is a liar and is here to steal your freedom from you. Bitcoin is not "legal tender". It really a made-up money of The People. So no government or third-party can ethically, morally make any claims of governance over a money created by The People for The People.
That's it. I'm done!

Cash is DEFINITELY on the way out.
WHEN the banksters outlaw cash, ALL thransactions can be tracked, taxed, and recorded by the banks and government. The head of Citibank, JP Morgan Chase, and French authorities are already talking up bans on cash and more capital controls. By the end of the decade, the modern Western world will be a very different place.

Bitcoin's USD value is one small measure of Bitcoin value, but not really that significant. The total Bitcoin pool is less than $4 billion worldwide. A drop in price shows more people selling Bitcoin than buying, but that also shows more merchants accepting it worldwide, then selling it at the end of the business day. The more it is sold off into fiat currency by businesses to pay staff, operation costs, etc, the more this may affect the overall price. And miners have to sell Bitcoin for fiat currency to pay their bills too.
The peak price was an obvious bubble from China's run on Bitcoin and Mt. Gox/Willy-Bot manipulation of market rates. You know this because once the market corrected itself, the price moved back to the trajectory it had before the bubble. Still about double the original price a year later than the price before the bubble.
You can say that the price drop is a good thing, in some regards. It shows merchants are accepting it more and more, and it's relatively low price makes getting into Bitcoin fairly inexpensive. If Bitcoin USD were $2-3k, that would do more hard than good. People would think it was a bubble, and/or too expensive/too late to get in on.
Look at the bright side. You can buy more Bitcoin, and you'll be that much farther ahead down the line. Don't mind the price too much. It is not a great indicator.  It's like rating the Internet's adoption based on how many fax machines it replaces.

Coindesk and CryptoCoinsNews aren't listed and they drive way more traffic than 90% of the sites listed.
Coindesk is about  worldwide ranked when you search its stats, and CCN is about  ranked worldwide. They list BitcoinMagazine.com as the  Bitcoin news/media site for Bitcoin, but it's global rank is over 80,000?  What's up with that?

You need to get out of that bank mentality. Bitcoin makes you your own bank. The regulations that would come with that would be horrible for the Bitcoin community.
Banks aren't here to help you, and Bitcoin exchanges have been horrible over the last year. Stop depending on 3rd parties! Depend on yourself and Bitcoin, and you'll be alright.

An FDIC for Bitcoin is a good idea, funded by the exchanges, like banks support the FDIC. A "centralized clearing house" is horrible idea, and would be the next choke point for hackers, corruption, or a strong-arming by a government body. Centralized financial areas have always proven to be a weakness, not a strength when it comes to consumer security.
Bitcoin doesn't need banks or massive exchanges that take money out of consumer's Bitcoin accounts. Its up to the Bitcoin community and its companies to exchange Bitcoin without centralizing it or compromising security.
