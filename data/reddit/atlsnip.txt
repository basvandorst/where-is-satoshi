the title :  


**TL:dr** of the article : Bitcoin is volatile.  
Well maybe if people start using Bitcoin as Bitcoin and not a thing it's not ... like tomorrow i would want my shoes to walk for me, but they can't so maybe i should stop buying shoes ...

I dont see how that's an excuse ... You are using a bot to avoid spam and have no control over it ? Well, disable it until you gain some power maybe ?

I have done like more than a 100 local trades on and off localbitcoins and I always do this for adress transactions.
I have an iphone but no access to the wallet on it, just scan the adress, send it through hangouts so my friend has it on his computer and then just look at the transaction from blockchain or blockr.
No problem so far :)
