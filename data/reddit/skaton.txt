Last time around, there was a free, online feed from ITV in the UK. I fired that up through a proxy based in the UK and watched Spain kick the Netherlands' butt. I'm a bloody Yank, FYI.

You're forgetting that mobile devices and PCs use different processors. Best case, everything needs to be recompiled, and worst case, many API calls will be different. Also, porting an old-school, windowed PC app to a tablet requires more effort than you're acknowledging.

A dollar is "legal tender for all debts, public and private." That doesn't mean everybody's gotta take green. It means that ALL dollars, from whichever part of the money supply, is legal tender.
That includes money in a bank. If a debtor wishes to refuse cash and only accept a bank wire transfer or checks, that's their prerogative, and it was your prerogative to get into debt with them or not.

When I think "democracy," I think "tyranny of the majority." Democracies in this fashion shine brightly with authoritarianism, especially if you're a minority at the losing end of "the will of the people."
I advocate the sovereignty of the individual. Sovereign entities are free to do as they choose, as long as their actions do not infringe on the sovereignty of another entity.
When and if said infringement occurs, it's an act of war, and will be dealt with by the parties involved, in a similar way to how sovereign nations handle disputes.

Bitcoin *was* bound for the moon before the explosion of various coins in the cryptocurrency scene. Now it's something of a wet dream, considering the value is all spread around now.
Bitcoin itself is too clunky. Have you ever tried to run a full node on a cheap VPS? It's almost an exercise in futility.
@_date: 2014-05-03 21:45:07
It's possible to squeeze a full node onto a 20GB VPS, but then if you want to search the blockchain, you can't use bitcoind. You have to install something like Insight which will eat up another 30GB on top of that, just because the data format bitcoind uses isn't searchable, I guess.

Pretty easy to explain if you think of it in terms of physical items. Lose your physical wallet? Kiss your bucks goodbye, unless an honest person finds it. Leave your PIN in your wallet and the person who finds it can drain your bank account.
Sensationalist news will always be with us, unfortunately. There is little you can do to mitigate its effect.

Here's a few good reasons to buy Bitcoins:
* Transmitting money, especially if you want to send it outside the banking system. Keep your cash out of the hands of criminals! Send money back home to your family near-instantly and super cheap.
* Want to avoid having your cash's value eaten away by inflation? Try Bitcoin. There's certainly no guarantees, but Bitcoin's value has increased 40 times in the last few years, and doubled in 2012. The number of available coins is fixed in the future, and no monopoly cartel is able to print it into oblivion.
* Do you run a business? Want to accept electronic payments securely and with no chance of chargebacks? Don't like excessive transaction fees? Bitcoin might be for you. Your next task is convincing a critical mass of your customers to pay you in Bitcoin, but the future is coming, and it costs you practically nothing to start accepting it now.
* Need to buy something discreetly? Want to pay someone anonymously? It's quite easy to do; just buy some coins and run them through a Bitcoin tumbler. Want to exercise your human right to buy something an oppressive government won't let you? Bitcoin is the answer!
* Do you have a philosophical aversion against fiat money created by criminal central banking cartels? Using Bitcoin to buy as many of your needs as possible might ease your mind. There aren't many grocers that accept Bitcoin yet, but there are many sites online that sell packaged, non-perishable food.
* Want to learn a little bit about how money really works? With Bitcoin, you can play around in an unregulated economy, just like your great-grandfather probably did :)

Just to set things straight, when you say "degenerate drug users," are you making a distinction between kinds of drug users, or are you making a blanket statement?

Haha, you're too much &lt;3 Italics are standard when using foreign words (like Latin) in an English passage.
I don't like how you expect me to assume which drugs you're talking about. Since we're talking about TM, I might guess you're talking about psychedelics, because that's what TM was talking about. But, what I think you're really talking about is illegal drugs, which is a pretty arbitrary distinction.
If I'm right, you lumping all illegal drugs together with their users into one big melting-pot of degeneracy is dumb. Carl Sagan smoked weed, he didn't smoke meth. Was he a degenerate too?
I've seen responsible drug use, and I've seen irresponsible drug use. I'm sure you have too.

You are begging this community to save you from yourself, without even realizing that's what you're doing. Please hear me out.
I was one of the very early adopters. I knew about Bitcoin when it was trading for 25 cents. CENTS. I bought 1000 BTC when they were under a dollar each. If I had just quit and let sit, I'd have as much money now as you started with.
But I didn't. I thought daytrading and arbitrage was a good way to make money. I thought $5 was far too high and didn't buy back in. After the bubble popped at $30 and the markets settled back down at $2, I was discouraged and went away.
I came back when it was $50. I bought a little and just left it. I'm now doing better than I was then because I'm not panicking and doing stupid shit.
Stop trying to regain your losses by daytrading. You're not an investment professional, and if you were, you'd realize what investment professionals do: that there are no crystal balls in finance, and the best business decisions are based on fundamentals, not speculation.
You would do well to read [this book]( It will explain to you the principles of sound investment, and with time and careful planning, you can regain all of your losses and then some.
