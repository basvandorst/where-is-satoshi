Cross-pollinate bitcorn with bitcasserloe it with bitpudding for killer results. Call it a reverse fork.

:( I guess my sarcasm was lost in the internets. Is there a standard protocol on Reddit for denoting sarcasm?

Just an idea :(

Let's buy a giant Bitcoin balloon in the Macy's day parade. Even though that's against my moral code given the worldwide helium shortage

I thought that was an embellishment until I did some quick googling. Forbes article put out in 2016 estimates $350 B - $2 Trillion. I guess since so many holdings are private and there are so many generations to track, it is difficult to lock down. No wonder they're the target of so many conspiracy theories.

Maybe I used the wrong word. My apologies. Maybe I should've used "mildly interesting." You can go about your day now.

For people wondering or saying that I have no marbles for comparing Gates to Bitcoin, I was juxtaposing the two to show how the richest man in the world's wealth compares to the total market cap of Bitcoin. I understand that a man and a currency/system are two entirely different things. But when I was thinking about the two, I thought about how easy it would be for someone as rich as him to completely change the entire market just by deciding to, because he has the resources to do so. It's just an interesting thought. I wasn't trying to make the comparison to Microsoft or anything else, just simply looking at how one man literally has 4x the wealth of the entire network.

So I read their blog post. I'm a ledger wallet user. Nano S. I have all correct firmware and apps on my device in preparation for the hard fork. HOWEVER - I am still slightly confused about how to effectively split my coins onto the two chains safely. I understand a lot of jargon but not all of it. Is there an idiot proof version of the "splitting section"??

All hail! Thanks mate. Can anyone else verify that this is how it should work in theory? (I trust you, just want to be sure, you know?)
