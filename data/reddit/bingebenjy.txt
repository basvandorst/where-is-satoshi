Also mastercard does not represent "normal currency", its a company that makes use of "normal currency" nothing more

This may be true be it is completely and utterly irrelevant. 
Everyone knows that the value of money is an implicit agreement among people in society, it didn't just drop out of the fucking sky. Humanity has constructed it as a tool to increase productivity, build and progress. It is in the interest of every person who owns a dollar to maintain the value of that dollar and therefore the trust we have in it. 
If you or I were to suddenly reject the dollar, we would lose the little we have. Even assets would lose there value because you wouldn't be able to convert them into liquid. 
Do you genuinely believe that companies like mastercard are afraid that any number of people are going to turn around tomorrow and declare that they no longer recognise the dollar? And in so doing abandon all their wealth? 
Sure its a cool idea and its crossed all our minds before but it is never going to happen and certainly isn't something Mastercard is worrying about...

Disappointed in r/bitcpin. Top comments are mostly circlejerks about how awesome OP is and any contestation of OP's totally hypothetical claims are systematically down voted...

So your argument is litterally "i like the guys who run botcoin more than i like the guys who run MasterCard"? Again true but totally irrelevant...
