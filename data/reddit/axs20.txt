Well, if you think about it, it's probably for the same reason. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:48:37
What if those fee tokens have multiplied in value several times over
@_date: 2018-01-06 12:55:53
10 BTD*
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:53:13
Meanwhile nearly every altcoin in the top 20 has gone 1000%+ in the past two months
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:12:01
Stock can also fall 
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:18:13
Well, actually, yes. It becomes assets. Unless you're trading forex, in which case you're trying to take advantage of swings in currency value.
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:08:38
How would they know where it came from once it's melted down?
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:05:41
It's because of the instability caused by transaction fees and refunds.
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:07:37
Fork coins are kind of like dividends
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:48:42
Really? Bought a ton of crypto with my chase card. Haven't heard a word
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:49:09
No limit bro
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:02:06
Just pay the card off lol

1. Yes
2. Raspberry pi

Hardware can be compromised in many ways. You don't have to produce your own software, you can examine the source.
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:07:34
I do the same XD
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:37:52
Not really. Credit score mainly consists of on time payments, credit utilization, and average account age. If those things are good it doesn't matter if you're constantly opening and closing new cards, hard pulls barely effect your score at all
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:21:36
Moneeo's skepticism Sunday is often posted in by zcash supporters, but that doesn't make it ineffective 
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:37:19
In a cash transaction, there's no record. With bitcoin there is a permanent record. How is this not more traceable?
If I was doing something illegal I'd use cash or xmr.
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:36:40
The whole point of crypto is to remove trusted third parties. What is ledger but a trusted third party?
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:19:45
Not necessarily, binance has an eth/trx market for example 
@_date: 2018-01-06 12:57:40
It grows at an incredibly predictable rate.
@_date: 2018-01-06 05:13:35
A lot of the alts that made moves like that were already in the top 20 beforehand 
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:57:02
It was intended to be money.
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:38:09
Lol, kraken's website doesn't even work 70% of the time.
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:17:08
Usd on coinbase is fdic insured, I'd say It's probably the safest place to cash out
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:34:22
They shouldn't need to, because when you sell you get the fiat from the buyer 
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:58:47
Either will work, seed or private key
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:04:48
Not much if you batched it. You couldn't take them back out though lol
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:26:11
Ah. In that case, you could generate keys from the seed words and import them into another wallet. I didn't know you couldn't import keys directly in a nano, I use an offline computer for my cold storage.

Index fund, sure, but you said stock. Stocks can go to 0. In fact a lot of stocks don't pay dividends or give you any voting rights, either. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:42:14
That's not how it works. Only the portion of your income that is above that tax bracket gets taxed at the higher rate.
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:25:26
Agreed. Although interestingly the same thing applies for crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:15:38
You have to account for inflation. $40 in 1970 had the buying power of roughly $250 today.
Obviously still a positive ROI though 
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:18:37
If a Bitcoin-based transaction was prolonged, the value of the coins being transferred could change "significantly", it said.
In these cases, customers had to transfer more bitcoins to make the payment, or get a refund. And either option would result in the customer paying more exchange fees, currently about $20.
Some customers adding bitcoins had even been caught out a second time as the value changed again.
"This year, we've seen increasing number of customers get into this state," Valve said.

Depends on the lender, none of my credit cards initiate a hard pull for a limit increase request.
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:10:35
Bitcoin is much more easily traced than cash; there's a permanent public ledger of all transactions.

Even if any of those coins become valuable, you'd have to destroy them to remove them from the floor.

Personally I'd cash out from multiple exchanges at once. I'm verified on several exchanges. Spread the risk around 
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:12:00
I'm sure lots, but not all alts are shitcoins
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:53:47
Everyone was trying to get free fork coins. The fork coin buzz seems to have died out significantly
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:11:43
The opposite, actually. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:54:36
Triggered lol
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:22:45
Yes, you should have. GDAX covers the fee for you on btc address withdrawals.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:55:04
Yes it did
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:01:00
You can transfer from coinbase to GDAX and withdraw to a BTC address for no fees. GDAX even covers the miner fee.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:30:33
Sure, but that was also the case with the Internet. However, we haven't gone to an entirely new version of the Internet yet, we've found scaling solutions and implemented them.
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:34:51
There's no reason it would have to be contentious 
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:50:16
sure it is, look at transaction volume over the last year
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:32:09
It does, but at the cost of being completely centralized.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:37:55
what are the specs on the computer? Ssd helps a lot and you need a newer processor

You could use a shift card or similar debit card solution but in the end you're just selling for fiat and using the fiat to purchase your groceries on the back end.

This is incorrect.
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:04:16
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:27:33
because people are more interested in getting rich

@_date: 2017-12-24 04:04:59
lol, have they even released the ico coins yet?
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:23:17
Hate to break it to you, but bank accounts are definitely monitored in the US.
The big idea behind this is that you as an individual can hold funds with no custodial risk. anything you hold in a bank can be frozen; that is impossible with crypto. and before you dismiss that as a possibility, look what happened in Greece.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:37:24
Ltc, bch, dash, iota, monero, several more altcoins
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:48:50
With ICOs falling under stricter regulations I think we are going to see even more of these fork coins
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:37:51

He's saying you need to send it to a software wallet with a selectable fee option. Although this is really only going to help with fees if the mempool isn't clogged up. In your scenario, transferring out to GDAX and withdrawing would have eliminated the fee.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:09:19
day trading wouldn't produce on chain transactions.
there's a lot of things that could impact transaction volumes, sure, but you can't deny that more transactions definitely means that it's being used more. 
retailer acceptance is growing. 
To me it seems like you value lack of volatility in your money more than privacy, immutability, and lack of custodial risk. And that's totally fine, but just because you don't value it more doesn't mean there isn't a group of people that do.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:44:16

Actually, they released instant bank payments on Oct 12.
"Instant bank purchases are now live for many of our customers in the US, and we will expand availability over the coming months. You will receive an email when instant purchases become available for your account."
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:38:51
That's only one exchange though. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:47:16
Of course they will, they want a cheaper entry point.

Monero I believe has the 2nd highest fees

Impossible, actually. Humans are not capable of randomness 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:09:02
I guess I was wrong, however, that means only their hot wallet is insured. Any breach of their cold wallet and you would still be SOL

That's the idea. Think if, for example, all major exchanges ran an lightning node, and they were all connected together. You would only have to have a channel open with one exchange, and you could send money to pretty much anyone.

Yes, he's saying once volatility decreases and it fluctuates less is when it will be truly accepted by society 
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:06:43
I don't but I'm sure it's posted here on Reddit somewhere. Many people were talking about it 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:11:01
That's not a good comparison. The daily volatility of the DOW has been around .5%... If you dropped 10%, that's 20 times the daily volatility.
Cryptocurrencies fluctuate that much in a single day all the time.
