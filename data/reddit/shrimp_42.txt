Tim Tam’s are probably the most popular chocolate candy in Australia. It’s like if the author was named Rolo Snickers

As someone living in Australia, I find it hard to keep a straight face when listening to the advice of a person named Tim Tam

I’m torn between and I feel like the internet has made me default to skepticism for everything, but I’d like this to be true

I’m keen! A few guys at work are also into crypto so I shall spread the word

Correct. We are better than this. He’s a very knowledgeable guy, and I’m sure his videos and talks have got a lot people into bitcoin and crypto, myself included, but this is so cringeworthy.

I posted something similar a few months ago when bringing funds from UK to Australia. Transferwise cost me less than 0.5% in fees, went from my UK bank to my Australia bank in a matter of hours, so fiat to fiat, and didn’t incur any tax penalty. I asked the CryptoCurrency sub if any viable cheaper and more secure crypto options were available that were as easy to use as Transferwise and the answer was no. For the record, I hold btc, XML, nano and I want to believe, but at the moment, for the vast majority of people, the user experience is far worse with crypto. Until that changes, don’t expect mass adoption

I’m flying back from UK to Sydney on Friday morning, pick me up and I’ll happily pay with Bitcoin!

Will do thanks!
