For women out there 
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:07:44
I'd be up for that!

SatoshisCat the group was made by someone else off the back of a post from myself back in Novemeber 
Its not about segregation, nor is it about avoiding conversing with men on the groups, its about connecting people, connecting other smart, like minded women together (and on a personal level occasionally asking the questions maybe I wouldn't post in other groups.)
Based on the PM's and responses I got from that post there was clearly an interest from these women to connect. It actually shows that that cryptocurrency is being adopted the way you want it to, its about raising the demographic and encouraging more women to get in to cryptocurrencies / blockchain when they come to reddit for the first time and try to make sense of it all. 
So maybe that means we're making a big deal of it.... but if thats the case then I'm pretty happy with that

Thats not was I was insinuating at all. I was just opening up a dialog to meet some other women here.... 
But thanks for the welcome!

Thats so cool thank you... I actually appreciate that as I'm needing everything ELI5 ha. Two birds one stone....

Thank you menomenna, honestly it was meant with all good intentions. I don't doubt for a second there are plenty of women out there investing, taking a huge interest, hell even helping to build this technology... I just noticed that a lot of the content I've been looking at myself to learn more about blockchain, alt coins, investing etc was largely produced by men. I just wanted to say hey, I'm here too! I think as you so eloquently describe, this is an important point and no doubt one that will be discussed increasingly as we see crypto advance and become a little more maintream and I'm looking forward to that. I am closely watching a company that I'm looking forward to entering the market and the whole concept of that company and blockchain is based one key lady's vision to re-distribute profits in the renewable energy industry. I think thats great news! Id love to see articles flashing up on my phone from both women and men finding solutions to problems that we've grown to just accept. I think I've gone on enough now but thanks for your well thought out words....

Hey how are you, thanks! Great that you get to learn a lot more insight in your career. We're a bit slow on the uptake here in the uk with no major corporations yet accepting btc as valid payment / currency but would love to be part of implementing some of the tech when we do. I work very closely with IBM and Accenture so talking about BTC to some of those women and men can make for pretty interesting conversation but outside of the work environment it brings fairly unenthusiastic responses lol. In some ways people just want the convenience without understanding the fundamentals behind it which I get, I saw another post earlier where someone summed it up pretty well; of all the people in the world who use internet, there are only few that really care about how it works. On the flip side I do believe in 10 years time we will all be talking cryptocurrency...
Have you decided to invest as of yet or are you still figuring it out? 
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:51:23
Even trying to understand the concept of some of the technologies goes way above my head, I want to be responsible and make rational investments that I believe in but know that I'm falling short when I don't completely understand, things such as white papers... they are so detailed I feel like I need to be a developer to get what they are all about

thanks for the link, I'd come across one of David's video's just the other night. I'll consciously watch a lot more if he's a recommended good source. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:05:38
I don't know if that was a joke or not lol but I think that would be pretty cool :-) 
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:35:32

@_date: 2017-10-23 21:25:20

@_date: 2017-10-26 23:06:21
awesome thanks for sharing 
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:44:35
OMG, I totally just opened that up thinking it was a serious women bitcoin group LOL was already thinking out my thanks response in my head lmao well played 
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:03:35
I will definitely take a look thanks for the info. Glad I posted on the topic now, starting to get a lot more insight and information now 
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:08:25
no doubt! I think we're in this weird age at the moment where we've advanced and are no longer part of the Industrial Age and have moved at such pace in to the digital / data age and the huge corporations and public sector just haven't kept up. I think to galvanise interest and enthusiasm we have to wait for our major players in these industries to catch up (or die out) this is why we've seen the start-ups and small businesses explode because they are going to market with the latest tech and can deliver changes within hours unlike the corps who are just continually updating / configuring out of date systems and doing a pretty terrible job at keeping customers happy. I think the likes of Uber, Lyft, Airbnb etc are setting the example and once they catch on to this and start to move in the same direction we'll really see mass adoption from all demographics. Who knows, it'll be an interesting few years though

did you order the nano in the end?
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:28:27
Sorry for the late response... The package is a small white box pretty similar to I've you buy like an apple product. It has clear cellophane wrapped all the way around. If yours doesn't come like this then send it back. I had to rip the plastic off before I could get in to the box. Still haven't got round to setting mine up yet but going to watch a couple of video's on youtube as I think it needs a bit of concentration. Good luck. P.S I bought mine to work on Mac
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:57:29
Mines just arrived today, looking forward to setting it up will let you know how I find it
