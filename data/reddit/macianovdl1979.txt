Clearly the problem of BTC isn't the cryptography. It's stuff like miner centralisation or internal struggles like segwit2x. 
I remember '11-'13, bitcoin was one community. Hardly any division at all. The enemy was banks, governments and them working together against the people.

Yet, after months of searching intensively by politicians, media and intelligence agencies *NOTHING* could relate Russia directly unequivocally to Wikileaks. You've been brainwashed. 
I used to think Wikileaks was a Russia-infiltrated organisation, but I came to the conclusion there was just nothing there. It was all media hype and hysteria.

We'll see for sure. You think Trump's opponents weren't motivated or that the people who could have ratted him out wouldn't have done that by now?
Really? 
Man... I'd love to bet against Mueller finding anything substantial linking Russia-Wikileaks-Trump.

Amir Taaki is great. He was one of the first bitcoiners I listened to. Back then he was filmed, squatting in Barcelona with other anarchists. 
Last thing I heard from him was that he had joined forces with Cody Wilson on the Dark Wallet project. I just googled turns out he was fighting in Syria as an anti-ISIS guerilla. Amazing.

I've been into bitcoin for a long time, and I'm not worried a lot, but bitcoin, like all things, must have some weakness somewhere.
It's a bit silly to pretend it's unkillable. Nothing is unkillable. It might take centuries, but something could be invented to kill it.

I didn't really understand the blocksize debate. I'm not a programmer and haven't been into bitcoin's daily troubles for a while, so I decided to read up. I was surprised to learn most of '13 bitcoiners had split between two pretty hostile camps. This made it even harder to figure things out, because it's hard to know who to trust to be correct.
However, I then read that Adam Back, Nick Szabo, and now Bram Cohen all supported core's general roadmap. They give good technical (hard forks can be dangerous, bigger blocks make the network possibly less safe in the future) and socio-economical arguments (bitcoin's value prop depends on security, trust and decentralization). 
On the other side are mostly libertarian utopists (Ver), businesses dependent on fast upscaling (BitPay) or status quo (ASIC miners) and a few disgruntled programmers (Garzik, Andresen). 
What more do you need to know?

There are hundreds of exchanges, literally. They’re easy to google. If you want to store your coins, get the QT wallet. Or buy a Trezor. 
Coinbase is clearly nothing much. They didn’t give holders their bcash yet, they didn’t implement segwit and their CEO said on tv: bitcoin broke his heart. He’s now into ethereum (for Christ sake!)
I understand noobs go for coinbase or blockchain.info as safe easy options, but after 2 weeks in crypto, get the hell out of there.

Jk, It's okay to use bitcoin man. Hoarding for the sake of it would mean nobody ever bought a bitcoin ever bc miners wld never sell

Lol Coinbase is worse than SHIT. Are you crazy?
I hope they go under for the benefit of bitcoin.
Coinbase is the luckiest company in the world. Founded by two connected Goldman Sachs dudes who stumbled on bitcoin.
They didn't need to do anything but hire a few competent coders and collect money from noobs. Yet they decided to get involved with scaling and dissing core. If Coinbase had gotten its way with the NYA, bitcoin would have completely been destroyed with Jeff Garzik's clown code.
Coinbase, Bitpay and whatnot are not serious or worthy bitcoin companies. They won't be much longer. Pretty soon you'll get the Zucks, Thiels, Jobses of the world involved with bitcoin and Coinbase et al will get Netscaped out of existence. Good riddance to very bad rubbish.

It's never good news if a country bans something and ruins an industry overnight. But, longterm, it's not necessarily bad news. China always was gonna ban bitcoin eventually, let's face it. Communists are not natural allies of censorship resistant currencies; they're natural foes.
And handicapping the power position of Chinese miners, who caused so much division, is a nice side effect; though they were unfairly forced into that position.

Of course Satoshi is Szabo... 
Just read his essay BitGold on his old blog. In the comments Szabo even asks commenters to help him code up a version of BitGold! Recently Tim Ferriss had Szabo on as a guest, why do you think Ferriss asked Szabo to be there? Out of all the people who would die to be on Ferriss' podcast for self-promotion reasons, it was Szabo he invited... But that's just one of 1000s of small indications Szabo is Satoshi. 
A Satoshi must have had extremely high IQ -- not just good smarts, real genius like Szabo. Combine that with Cypherpunk ideas about privacy, money and cryptography; interest in classical economics and money origins; knowledge of algorithms &amp; computer science skills; etc.
Szabo is the only man in the world -- except maybe Hal Finney? --, who had expressed both the competence, the knowledge and the interest to be able to imagine something like bitcoin. Szabo was also the guy who wanted to disintermediate trusted third parties! If anyone knows any other person in the world who, prior to 2009, had showed anything close to Szabo's profile, I'd like to know about it. Adam Back would qualify, but he wasn't the guy. 
Even today people scream for blockchain developer talent. It's not easy, it's hard. Satoshi couldn't have been anybody. Bitcoin is not something you just code up in an afternoon. Talent alone would not have been enough, you'd have needed the intelligence, passion, education and interests of someone like Szabo to imagine it.

When I got into bitcoin, I learned most from Ver, Voorhees, Jon Matonis, Andresen, Rick Falkvinge, Tuur de Meester, Max Keiser, Andreas Antonopoulos &amp; Trace Mayer. Dozens of others, too. Great people, and most of them had the same message: honest money for sovereign people. 
After a couple years, a lot of these people have gone rogue, crazy even. Tuur, Trace, Keiser &amp; Andreas are still very useful go-to people; sadly, some of the others talk like they belong in a mental institution. Is this a temporary thing or are the others really lost for good?

We've had several Nobel laureats whose only contribution to the discussion has been: "bubble". They might have a 3 standard deviation better brain than you and me, they sure as hell haven't used their raw horsepower on this issue.
Also, since you decided to take "truth is in the middle" fallacy: what kind of criticism leveled at bitcoin, either technical or economic, enlightens the discussion?
I've studied them all so far, for years, I can't find one thing about bitcoin which would render the idea and concept invalid. It's been a scientific breakthrough in theory, and it's working in practice.

I'm 37, when I was 18 email was just getting mainstream. Back then there were prominent economists who said people would never buy stuff on the internet. And back then, people really didn't buy stuff on the internet. Smartphones, social media and torrenting didn't exist; these things weren't even considered possible. Yet, they happened within less than 20 years.
Hyperbitcoinization won't happen with public-key wallets and unfriendly GUIs, but over time crypto will creep in everywhere; and when I write crypto, I think it will be bitcoin. Bitcoin is already eating up all the niche use cases (alternative for gold, donation to political dissidents, P2P payments for people in boycotted markets, illicit dealings, inflation hedge, etc.) For these niche cases it doesn’t matter that bitcoin is difficult to use or volatile for the simple reason that they don’t have an alternative. But over time, bitcoin will become as easy, safe, common and scalable as ordinary money. It’s already much easier than 4 years ago. An example: if you want to trade altcoins, you can use a hardware wallet and services like ShapeShift. A few years ago, you needed all sorts of QT wallets or unsafe, shady PHP-infra exchanges with low volumes. 
So, I’m doubtful of fast S-curve adoption, but I’m not doubtful of hyperbitcoinization.

I agree there's a risk, but let's look at the great fork experiment.
It seems that minercoin Bitcoin Cash is losing value by the day.
Miners can deny the economic majority, but they can't force the economic majority to use their B2X coin or bitcoin cash. They'll need a totalitarian state for that. 
So, "Chill" no, I agree. But it's wise to have faith in scenarios which follow economic laws that have been vindicated many times. Miner coins will fail if users want another coin. It's the subjective theory of value.

Holding bitcoin demands 3 things;

1) The history of fiat proves all fiat goes to zero, eventually.
2) After fiat goes to zero people revalue sound money.
3) Bitcoin is sound money, so some people will opt for bitcoin; at least for a part.

I disagree.
It doesn't matter if you get a fraudulent Blockchain link or the real Blockchain.com

The first one at least doesn't destroy bitcoin as a whole.

Erik used to be a great bitcoiner. 
Over the years he has become exactly the kind of thing everyone in bitcoin eschewed in the beginning: the corporatist banker-type who for selfish interests wants to decide how everyone else has to live.
Of all these sell-outs, Erik's transformation disappointed me the most. He's a lot smarter and moderate than, say, Ver and he clearly seemed to be in crypto for ideological reasons, like freedom of money. Now look at him. Sad. 
But let Erik be a warning. Even the strongest among us are seduced by money and power.

I don't care about the tech itself, for all I know 2MB is the best idea ever, nor do I think HFs are by definition wrong.
At the moment, you're part of a consortium of bitcoin businesses which, if its actions are successful, will have control over development. That's corporatist by definition. Not only that, you seem to be one of the most vocal proponents of the proposition, thereby indicating you're one of its biggest supporters.
And you may have seen value in bitcoin before others did, I used to commend you for that. However, if you guys succeed, you will steer bitcoin in certain directions; directions which will limit bitcoin's use cases and make it less valuable in the future. Let's be honest, this wasn't just about a blocksize impasse, but a power grab to save business models for low fees/high volumes. 
It's clear nothing can change your mind, so I'll leave it at that.

Oh my bad, I made the mistake of checking Wikipedia which says "People's Republic of China" run by the "communist party of China" without any free elections.
But on topic: a "authoritarian capitalism w/ a few welfare programs" system will inevitably clash with a censorship resistant, uncontrollable currency, too. There's zero interest for them to allow bitcoin if it clashes with their power base, of which currency control is a huge pillar.

ofcourse szabo was capable of programming, but this isnt the crux. szabo asked for help on his blog to code up bitgold. that proves he needed someone for help, assistance, debugging and review. at the time, most cypherpunks like adam back &amp; wei dai didnt care for satoshi's request, but finney did! 
i think it's too coincidental for finney to be both the first bitcoin receiver and not knowing satoshi. don't forget: back then bitcoin was nothing. it was still just a low profile project. i can easily see why finney didnt care about keeping his name hidden. it's more likely that finney knew who satoshi was but denied it. I think Szabo is Satoshi, with Finney having been his expert right-hand. 
Also, geniuses are extremely rare, genial domain experts even rarer. There is nobody else alive who had Szabo's intellect, skills, experience &amp; obsessions. And I've looked around a lot. Only Adam Back &amp; Finney qualify.
