Funny that you chose the words "idealized fiction" after stating a libertarian fantasy that's not only implausible but also entirely untenable.
Probably rights enforcement agencies, tho, yeah, they'll protect us in an entirely different fashion than the "idealized fiction" of a centralized government.

 also a good choice for StreamLabs and StreamElements.

Thanks for the downvote, you can have your inanity to yourself.

Zerohedge is garbage.

I don't think the USD is going anywhere; I'd be stunned if anybody living within US territory would be able to opt out of it entirely.
I think reasonable people can disagree about this, but I see Bitcoin's ceiling as a legitimate alternative currency, not as a global replacement currency. Like I said, I doubt the domestic market cap of Bitcoin ever trifles with that of the USD... particularly once our legislators decide to identify Bitcoin as a legitimate threat (although what they can do to stop its growth is dubious at best), so I just can't envision a scenario that it's a genuine rival in the sense that it threatens the Federal Reserve's power to centralize the vast majority of currency decisions in the United States.

I upgraded from 0.7.2 on Ubuntu and it made me empty ~/.bitcoin (save for wallet.dat, of course). Might have been able to get away with not deleting my huge block*.dat's though?

Maybe this is too but maybe they're the rogue trader looking to gain a trust-giving following that they can later profit from? Probably too @_date: 2013-02-22 05:50:21

What makes Bitcoin so attractive to the gambling community is that you don't deal with payment processors: all the sportsbook and poker/casino sites that got nailed got nailed because they interfaced withe US payment processors in an invalid way. You take that away and you take away what makes Internet gambling illegal in the United States.

When you talk about funding a welfare/warfare state, you're talking about taxation, right? Transacting in Bitcoin doesn't stop the government from being able to tax my Bitcoin profits. Imo, it should be treated like any other currency. If you're referring to funding federal programs by devaluing our currency, I don't think Bitcoin is ever going to have the kind of domestic market cap that it seriously devalues their ability to monetize their own debt. What you're speaking of -- if it's even feasible -- is many years down the road, in my opinion.

Agree. I don't think Bitcoin should be paraded as a means to evade the federal government(s). It should be paraded as a means to decentralize the process of holding and transacting currency in an international market; as a means for reducing the costs of and simplifying payments between consenting parties.

Not to be snarky, but running a online business that operates in Bitcoin, or a B&amp;M business that accepts Bitcoin payments. It's much easier than you (probably) think...

There are literally (conservatively) tens of thousands of people who would've said the same thing you just said -- replacing the number "200" with whatever peak we all thought was unsustainable -- post-crash, wherever it happened. You add nothing to the discussion.

So this works like a debit card, no? A fucking VISA debit card? I get the feeling this kind of thing isn't going to have a long shelf-life in the USA, but I'm pretty awed.
EDIT: Or, okay, let's say you're making a huge purchase... a car, let's say, for 2000BTC. You say it's a buyer's market: you're buying that amount of USD into the BTC sell market? That's a bit less appetizing when the exchange isn't so big.

You can.

A fork in the blockchain isn't really a little problem at all. Just because it was handled well doesn't mean it wasn't something fairly major.
@_date: 2013-02-07 21:40:45
I probably will... thanks for the heads up on this.

Not really digging the Bitcoin -&gt; tax evasion thing. Things (digital and real) have value, and if you're using Bitcoin to evade the federal government, you're a fucking dumbass and you deserve to be audited.
What I like about Bitcoin -- from a business perspective -- is that it completely negates PCI compliance, greatly simplifies bookkeeping, offers instant internationalization, and lowers costs all around. If it weren't so volatile and so fucking difficult to turn BTC into groceries, plane tickets, and a car without a reasonable loss on exchange, I think we'd see a lot more people diving in headfirst.
