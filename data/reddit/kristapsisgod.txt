Yea use an app that tracks your portfolio and you can just enter how much btc you have. On iOS I’m using CoinCap to do so.

Pay off loans! Trust me, it’s more fun investing when you don’t have to worry about that on your back

Sending humans to Mars is a lot more practical for human society than mining bitcoin lmao

Yea you're right it's probably trillions though, I was kind of selling it short. Even then, I just don't think they could mine enough in space to make substantial money. That other thread a couple days ago mentioned mining with nuclear energy, with the potential to make 7 million a day. Now that I can get behind, but in space, shit is expensive.
Space exploration isn't about being profitable too, it's more about pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and our curiosity to figure out what is out there in the universe. NASA doesn't aim to turn a profit, otherwise they'd wouldn't build rockets that cost hundreds of millions to launch a single time.
We may never have a habitable colony on Mars for hundreds of years, but the technology developed to make a trip there would spur new developments in technology. And if we can mine the resources and bring them back? That would be very profitable, probably to private businesses though.

I’d love a coffee after helping all these old ladies with their computer issues all day! Nothing but password resets and toolbar removals, this would brighten my day!

Classic clickbait by putting exact numbers imo. “Learn how I made 8,876.38 this month by doing NOTHING!”

The advancements in science and technology would FAR outweigh any money received from Bitcoin. Plus actual mining of resources on Mars could be in a range of billions.

Absolutely not, put at most 30-40%.

Because not all Chinese people speak in a stereotypical accent that we all heard in movies and TV.
