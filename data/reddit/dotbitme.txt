Not that I know of, you need to be in possession of your own private key OR the exchange need to support the altcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:06:05
No, you have to claim the coins and how that is done differs for different altcoins. Check the "how to claim" links on btcdiv.com
Here's a good general summery:

Thanks, [I did that]( before posting here but it seems to have gone unnoticed apart from the one downvote :)

Strange, I collect the info from the Bitcoin Gold blockchain so it should be correct.

Most (all except bcash) have different address formats and are therefore replay protected if I am not mistaken.
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:33:52
Yeah it's crazy. And yes they probably know.
Quite a few of the addresses on  contain a lot of altcoin wealth.
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:30:19
I would love to but haven't found a way to do that. Coins that lack a public blockchain or use proprietary ways to convert between bitcoin and the altcoin funds makes it difficult.
I am working on solutions though.

I run a site at  where I try to collect and list all forks and airdrops to Bitcoin owners. I agree the new B2X seems shady but have listed it under the Upcoming tab.

See above

Thanks! Even though it is not active, I added it to the list.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:19:45
Thanks! And https was always the plan, have just been waiting for the certificate.
It's now active and with a A+ rating from  no less!

Anyone who thinks they can beat the market with TA should read [A random walk down wall street]( a classic that discusses stocks but applies equally well to crypto.

The quote is from [Forbes](
So the world's most privacy conscious person of whom no photos exist and who has been in hiding for seven years suddenly decides to reveal himself. And how? A new website where visitors are met by a huge photo of him with a smug smile.
I just can't buy that.

Sorry I didn't mean to be rude. The counter at the top updates every few seconds and shows how much the value of your "stash" changed since you opened the page.
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:02:20
Thank you! Sorry, just BTC for now.
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:02:55
Are you trolling? Surely you can see what i does?
@_date: 2013-09-05 20:04:48
This is still a new feature and there's been no sales yet other then transactions between me and other users where I offered domains for very low prices to test the system.
Please note that a lot of the domains currently for sale are priced crazy high. The domain .bit is still not recognised by ICANN and still some domains are on offer for tens of bitcoins which in my view seems high.
But price your domains with moderation and they might sell. To transfer your domains in to dotbit.me, to offer them for sale and to transfer domains out is totally free so you can try it out without loosing anything.
@_date: 2013-09-06 10:19:03
No. Not unless the owner left contact information in the value field connected to the domain. You can view the value field of any registered domain by going to dotbit.me, entering the domain name and pressing 'Check'. The site will tell you the domain is registered and show an Info button. 
@_date: 2013-09-05 19:54:51
I'm sorry to hear that, there's a risk that site is down permanently. Maybe you can try contacting them via email. If they still have your domain and you cannot reach them, your only option is to wait until it's automatically unregistered after 36000 blocks.
This is unfortunately the risk of using registrars instead of running the software yourself. You need to be able to find a registrar you can trust. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:44:28
If you are interested in registering .bit domains but find the system too complex or if you do not own any Namecoins, I run a site called [dotbit.me]( where I have tried to simplify the process and where you can pay with Litecoins and Bitcoins in addition to Namecoins.
I charge a higher fee per domain than if you would register the domain with the Namecoin software but hope the simple process and additional features (like automatically keeping domains from expiring) will be worth it for a lot of you.
Check it out: [dotbit.me](

Are you talking about namecoin.com? That site seems to be down, I am not sure for how long.
Or do you mean that you registered the domain with the namecoin software?
