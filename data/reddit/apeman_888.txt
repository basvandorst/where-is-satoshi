Xapo was just as hard, I gave up b/c I only use PO Boxes and don't have mail with my address on it.  Haven't used Gemini, I will check it

how sustainable is that source of financing? seems precariously exposed to volatility and exogenous shocks

is that a 2-day lag?  if you want I could do a regression/forecast and quantify that relationship

I think J. Bezos would agree with you there.

I don't think that is a critique of Mr. Wright as much as it is Australia's treatment of BTC as an Asset and not a Currency.
Time will flush all this out, consensus will be reached but I have found little insight from web-pundits

I did get that cozy BofA feel from coinbase. Surprised they didn't offer me a new toaster for signing up.  Is Xapo's security measures overblown?

more important is # transactions.  Won't grow unless people actually spend it, but people don't want to spend it out of misguided hopes of becoming rich quick through speculation

It doesn't appear that Wright spent very much time/energy proving he is SN.  more like the bare minimum.  CW is a social butterfingers, SN or not.

1) Maybe he lost the keys, on an old hardrive, or spilt Coffee, or vegemite on his machine, and is embarrassed/concerned that telling us this would discourage use of BTC as a 'difficult to manage e-cash'
2) Maybe government officials are threatening that is he really is SN and they can prove it, then he is going to jail for tax evasion and aiding terrorists
