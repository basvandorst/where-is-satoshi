Yeah but I've seen "too much" tipping on the sub, but I guess it's just the hype at the moment. 
You should get an Xbox when you can, specially if you live in the States you can use it for so much more than just a gaming console (At least this is what I've read). You'll not regret it!

Yeah that might be it, it's higher now tho and it doesn't seem that the tips didn't get recorded.

Just had to connect more accounts... :) Connected a couple more and now it's fine. 
Guess my gilding will have to wait then, will have to look into it a bit more than I hoped. Thank you!

I can tell that y'all are genuinely good people. Don't take any shit from people, even if Bitcoins don't pan out (I'm not really up to date but I'd say it's quite established by now) you have done a great job. Hope to see more of you guys over at and actually join our community and not just tip users (It's nice but I feel that it quickly could go out of hand where people start to seek out the tips).

Definitely, no sleep for that bot today.

Hey, I have a question, all these tips that I've got today (Thank you to all of you here!), can I use them directly to gild people on Reddit or do I need to make a wallet or something? It says I've hit the max for what I can get tipped on my first day, is that enough for gold? :P 
@_date: 2014-12-11 17:07:57
Thanks man! Now I just need to read up on how to deal with the tips, but that'll be my weekend project.

I did that, if you mean for the 'Billing Info' at

Darn... I hope maybe someone has found a way to work around it then, my tries has been in vain.

So I got a couple of questions.. O have some btc stashed at cointip that isn't alive anymore but my cash is still there and I need to move it. It's approximately 0.03 btc which is not a lot and I was thinking that I'd just have fun with it and daytrade. Also I'd like to cash some of it out and buy stuff, where should I keep a wallet? I'm not looking to buy a hardware solution at this time but wouldn't mind having it on my pc or phone. What is a good site for European people with low fees for transactions and money transfers?

Sooo, I got some bits and pieces from guys on this sub back when ChangeTip was still around and now I want to move that amount and was thinking that I might want to start trading a bit with it to see if I can make it grow as BTC is fluctuating for 2-300$ a day. What should be my first step? I need to transfer my coins to a wallet, what does not having my private keys mean really? That the "bank" could just claim all my money? What site is recommended for smaller amounts of trading (~10-100$ per transaction)
I'm mad that I didn't invest in this back in '13 and still mad that I didn't jump in last month when it was around 5500...
