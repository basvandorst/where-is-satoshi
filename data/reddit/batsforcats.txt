I'm sure Mike Novogratz spends a lot of time in the space, but to make any claims about price stability is just ludicrous.

No that makes zero sense from hashes point of view. Ghash doesn't care about being conservative with funds or making "money" from customers. 
Gnash cares solely about having a dominate infrastructure in place to keep transacting and mining bitcoins. They want to always have more hashing power than anyone else. 
If you stop financing their operations they start self financing. They are so large at this point they are just going keep growing. 
I would be curious to see how much of their hashing power from contributed rigs and ones that they control directly through cex.io 
It'll never happen mind you., even still I wonder.

That is always the question. Now to be fair. You'll wind up creating multiple paper wallets over your time. A hand laminator shouldn't be too expensive.

Thanks for showing me my next customers. 
@_date: 2014-06-24 13:10:11
This right here people. Thank you sir. I will advise all my newbie friends to laminate their paper wallets. 
@_date: 2014-06-07 14:10:38
This is a perfect analogy. Thank you.

I'm going to weigh in from a purely political standpoint. 
Majority of Canadians are unhappy with the current government and their legislature. 
The problem is that in canada the youth don't vote. So everyone that complains hasn't done a thing to change it. 
If you look at the numbers that the conservatives got majority. You'll see it's almost perfect math to make that happen. 
Something crazy like 60% or more of students do not vote. 
Just food for thought. 
EDIT: for grammar

Seriously? Wasn’t their whole point to be settled “physically” or with bitcoin? Here we go rehypothecation round 55.

Look I’m not disagreeing with you there. 
I’m not championing anything but to refute the notion on there is only one bitcoin or will every only be one bitcoin. 
The concept of a name here doesn’t feel very relevant, Bitcoin started as an idea. 
One profoundly amazing idea, one that lead to the bitcoin protocol, which ultimately formed into a dataset(genesis block) ,shared and is now colloquially referred to as Bitcoin. 
However as an idea it lead into a doctrine if you will, and most doctrines it always leads to some sort of fanaticism. 
There will always be many interpretations of what the intention of the ledger + white paper is.(you can replace the bible too if you want) 
They are all Bitcoin sects, or forks if you will, it doesn’t make yours anymore true or right. 
They all stem from the same idea, those same set of rules. If people change their minds it’s entirely normal for them to re assembly. 
Otherwise we’d still be taking eyes for eyes �� 
There are many many variations of religion, you just kinda buy in to what you want, the same is true for crypto currencies and DLTs. 
Maximalists are always the fanatics, or extremists in some shale or another. 
They believe. Round what doubt can provide, they’re right, blinded by their ideals and led by their doctrine, regardless of your opinion or data they will not waver. 
Those who don’t know history are doomed to repeat it.

Sure but Nakamoto Consensus only applies if we all agree to the same rules, if I got more people to call my 21M shells Bitcoin around the globe and exchange them today, it makes my thing way more Bitcoin than any distributed ledger technology going around. 
Why is that, because the argument is so stupidly placed around a Brand.
Bitcoin Cash is a brand, Bitcoin SV another one. 
Regardless of how shitty the brand, it doesn’t make it any less a name and a valid one. 
The public facing argument is dumb, they’re worried about “confusion in the market” they want people to easily buy so they can see the asset increase in value. It’s just pure greed, which totally makes sense it’s the only thing you can guarantee with humans.
@_date: 2019-06-01 14:07:30
Y’all broken to think there is only one Bitcoin. 
It’s an idea, you can’t only have one of an idea, there are many implementations of nakamoto Consensus, which is what you’re all effectively arguing against. 
You might believe in only one bitcoin but that doesn’t make the statement anymore true.

Hey! ��,
First things first get yourself a hardware wallet ordered. 
Then, go and split your coins. 
You’ll have a couple chains now that you can sell if you don’t care about them. 
Make sure to split your coins. 
One more time, split your coins! 
If you don’t know what I’m talking about just start googling, bitcoin cash coin split tutorial, there is bit coin gold(careful no replay protection here). 
Also a split coming up for bch holders. 
So you’ll want to split before the fork.

I’m not saying it doesn’t work. I’m saying it’s not sustainable. Two completely diff points. 
580k blocks is very nice. Will it make 2 m blocks. Well have to see. The incentives in simulations don’t hold up. The market for bitcoin is dwindling, the shelling point will eventually get hit. Then the chain will have serious problems.
@_date: 2019-09-02 20:53:30
Not saying bitcoin is not secure. It’s slow moving and is going to miss it’s window. 
Lightning network is a joke. 
It’s ineffective in allocating resources for what it’s enabling. 
It’s current financial model and market will not allow it to survive once block rewards have been reduced below the shelling point. 
Txn fees won’t cover it, so either inflation or death imo. 
Other chains will have garnered more widespread solutions to enable decentralized finance and commerce. 
Bitcoin started the conversation is just left half way through.
@_date: 2019-09-13 21:30:14
Right but my arm get here is over semantics. And that is what is Bitcoin?
There’s your opinions and there is Rogers. 
He owns the domain and is a company named Bitcoin as associated with bitcoin cash. 
My company can be called Gold.com and I don’t have to sell gold. 
Like let’s be real this is a problem with education in the space and not fraud.

Look I’m not gonna argue my knowledge with you. I’m confident I know enough to make informed decisions. I’ve written EIPs been in debates about BIPs, I’ve built on bitcoin and ethereum and just believe bitcoin isn’t going to solve the problems we face in society. 
I spend my time and energy working to make ethereum better.
Cheers! ��

What’s reasonable in this case? Is that defined currently? There are many versions of bitcoin. There are many versions of shoes. 
We’re in uncharted territory. Is bitcoin a company, or a currency. There are Australian dollars, US dollars, Canadian dollars,
We got BTC, BCH, etc, so what your arguing is that he’s selling a different software token under a generic name. It’s not fraud it’s just non defined legal situations.
@_date: 2019-09-13 08:04:46
Lmfao you’re quite ill informed.

Lol don’t mistake my comments for support of Roger. He can go fuck himself. 
My point is y’all are angry and claiming fraud when it’s not quite like that. 
Lol at calling me a scammer. This sub is too rich. I hold zero bitcoin and zero bcash. Bitcoin software is outdated and useless to me.
@_date: 2019-09-02 15:26:29
Not bitcoin, crypto. Bitcoin is hardly your best bet.
@_date: 2019-09-13 06:15:37
Its not fraud. This sub keeps using that word and it’s entirely wrong. 
For fraud to be happening someone, person or company, has to be wronged by the action. 
In this case Roger owns the domain and is selling what he wants and how he wants. 
That’s not fraud. Please stop this dribble of a narrative.

Such a fallacy. Hyperbitcoinization is not gonna happen. It’s a concept created to keep retail buying.

Problem is we need people to care about Austrian economics. The next generation doesn’t. 
Scarcity of wealth is no longer something people care about. Talk to any millennial about their monetary habits or Gen Z, the next 59 years aren’t going to be run by people who believe in old monetary policies. 
People want a surplus of everything always. Money systems will be forced to go that route. Some form of inflation is inevitable. 
Hyper bitcoinization is a fallacy.
