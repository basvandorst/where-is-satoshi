IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAND! 
For now

I know right? I'll probably get gilded for this comment, as always...
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:10:20
Everything on this sub gets downvoted pretty much right away. Bots.

Crashing... We're still well above yesterday's ATH. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:02:45
[Remind you of anyone?](

I like how every time the price drops a few % this sub get spammed with posts and comments about the "crash", even when it's well above the previous days ATH.
Zoom out your damn graph people!

If it'll make you feel better you can read about all the people who used to have a lot of Bitcoin in the beginning but lost them. If that doesn't help there's a few Bitcoin related suicide stories too! Should brighten your day a little! ��

Just to confirm I'm doing it right - did you take a picture of just the ID page [like this]( or the whole thing [like this](
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:03:25


Yeah I think we're past that point. Did you watch the news, read a newspaper or listen to the radio lately?
I mean... Coinbase is the top app on Apple's app store... That's pretty mainstream.

Very good example of why wallets should be generated offline! I'm surprised no one took a peek at the source code for so long though. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:43:29
It ain't gonna suck itself... 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:31:04
Clearly we're in the middle of a [massive crash]( 
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:23:21
Spend bitcoin, use the fiat you didn't spend to buy more bitcoin. Everybody wins! 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:15:10
Aaaand 15k. Buy high sell low OP! 
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:38:47
Zoom your graph out.

This friend, is he trusted by both of you? If so, have him act as an escrow. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:08:22
Now it's gonna craaaash, all the way down to $25k
@_date: 2018-05-03 17:55:04
But... But... They started it!! I'm telling on you!
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:41:20
Just because you can afford to lose it doesn't mean you don't care if you do. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:04:08
You buy $5 worth of bitcoin today. When the price doubles you now have $10 worth of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:24:23
The way things are going, if it hits 10k in 2018 I'm buying that dip. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:58:20
I don't really know much about it in-depth. Puzzle transactions are (weak?) wallets that are put there as an incentive to participate, I think. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:26:15
I'm still wrapping my head around SegWit, so bear with the dumb question. How do you tell a SegWit wallet from a non-SegWit? What if I use a paper wallet like [this]( 
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:30:24
So the only sure way to tell would be to actually do a transaction right? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:22:29
Funny, I thought the same thing when it was trying to break $1000. Figured I was too late to the party at that point. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:06:42
Essentially zero, but it [has happened]( 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:52:30
Still makes sense though.
@_date: 2018-07-20 09:17:14
Thanks, I guess I never looked at it from that perspective before!
@_date: 2018-07-19 19:19:46
Explain that logic.
