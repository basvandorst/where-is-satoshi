Just encrypt your private keys with AES-128 using a pretty long password/phrase before printing or storing them. Then decrypt them using that password you remember whenever you want your actual private key.
No hassle with holographic stickers, folded papers or whatever. And it's safer as it makes every physical object useless for stealing and you can even store that encrypted private key in the cloud, whatever service you're using. I store them on paper, USB drive, Dropbox and in a Google Drive spreadsheet.

PayPal had to comment on Bitcoin. There was no way to avoid it because it would make that company obsolete to their very foundation if it would work out. They've put themselves in a position where they can later say "Oh we've looked at it and it's not for us". I think this will happen because obviously I don't think PayPal actually can integrate Bitcoin in a meaningful and doable way for both them and the consumer. Bitcoin does everything PayPal does, better.

True, though not an optimal flow, it does seem to be the best solution for iOS6 devices and up.

I think my only concern so far is that the private key for the paper wallet is on the screen for everyone to see or cap. I'd say censor it and spit out the wallet facing down.
Or did I see wrong?

Not directly, but I would pay for my Spotify premium with BTC.

I would say not unless you buy a pre-order from someone that ordered at least a few months ago instead of ordering now.

And that's where their inability to understand turns to furious rage.

I'd say go for another challenge. I'll see if I can give it another shot.
I just quickly whipped up a permutation script in Java before I realized this took way too long.

I dislike "reporters" or "economists" that know close to nothing about the technology yet just randomly throw words like hacker currency, hacked, Silk Road, drugs, big crash or bubble in just about every sentence of their articles.
I guess they all want to be the first market genius that predicted its downfall. For me it's more of a sign of how disruptive this really is. We'll see.
To me a hacker is obviously mostly positive, but to the vast majority of people the term hacker is much more negative indeed.

Download a reliable offline javascript bitcoin address generator. I print these public addresses next to a QR code for sending my address to others or easily checking the balance with my phone. 
I encrypt the private key with AES-128 with a pretty long passphrase only I know. I print that on that same piece of paper with a corresponding QR code generated from it. 
When I want to access that paper wallet saving address I scan that QR code and decrypt it with a client-side AES-128 decrypter. Theres my private key.
I think of it as a middle between a paper and a brain wallet. It requires aspects of both and makes stealing even your paper wallets useless.
