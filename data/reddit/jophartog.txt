TL;DR Bitcoin is not Money!
In the UK it is a "good" with a VAT exception. I think that's a much better solution then fight for "money" status. People are not checking properly what the "money" status would imply. 
I asked several times if this would imply a money licensing permit for everybody who would like to trade bitcoin. I have not received an answer yet, so im guessing im right.
Please read into this stuff before you donate!

Oh wow, was not aware about it not being developed anymore. You might want to try our new wallet  if you want support for your wallet software.
I find it very weird you can still find this wallet on  after reading these statements.

Those are some tokens on the Counterparty Protocol which got burned. Probably something to do with the token burn after the crowdsale of Spells Of Genesis. 
Here you will find some more information, scroll to the bottom for the Counterparty data. Counterparty uses bitcoin transactions for the security of their protocol.

Same here, I just received a e-mail from them again:
Thank you for contacting us. Unfortunately I can not offer an accurate estimate for when your refund will be complete. Due to the impact of the FTC action on our business it is taking significantly longer now to make our way through the refund request queue. Our team is working through the existing backlog of requests as quickly as possible but it could still be a few months or more before your refund is processed. We appreciate your patience and will notify you when the payment has been sent.
I am waiting now for more then 1 year and 1 month, but offcourse they would blame the FTC for all their problems... idiots.
