There are multiple wallets for almost every platform out there. What wallet are you using? If it is a deterministic wallet like mycelium you can get the coins out by restoring from seed.

No it's not and neither is this about mining which is probably the source of your confusion. It's about implementing software in hardware for maximum performance and that's what FPGAs are for. 
ASICs can't be reprogrammed like FPGAs can.

That's what ownership is.
BTW are you the same guy who trolls the wall observer thread on the forum?

BitDeed would have been better because a deed of ownership is what we have.

LOL no! They help the government track whatever you do online.

BTW bitcoinj is a java bitcoin library  and it powers both Mycelium and multibit.

If it doesn't see the full blockchain it isn't a fully validating node. 
If you just want to download some of the blockchain then you can use an SPV client like multibit.

Before it can "drop" old history it has to *download* old history, validate it and then prune it. 
I suppose you could sideload the pruned blockchain. Not sure where you'd find an up to date copy of that. And you'd have to trust the source.

No need for that. You need USD sitting in another exchange, though. Buy btc on the other exchange, withdraw to btc-e, sell, wait for normalcy to return (i.e. btc-e price to go below other exchanges), buy btc, withdraw btc to the other exchange and sell it there. You'll end up with more USD than you started out with.

BTC-E supports moneypolo deposits. Probably cheaper to buy from them.

We know how many coins are in existence because they are all generated in public in a coinbase transaction recorded on the public blockchain. The generation of new coins occurs according to a fixed schedule (more or less) so we always know how many coins exist and how many are going to be created in the future.
Exchanges are not home to the majority of coins generated to date. The vast majority has never hit an exchange. They are held in early adopters' wallets.

Yep banks don't like bitcoin. What else is new?

It's about as fake as the volume on wall street since the invention of HFT.

I bet somebody with an FPGA farm is thinking of having a go at this. 1 btc might be enough to make it worthwhile.

I hate it when people respond like this. I guess I'll have to prove my point:
Bitcoin addresses involve 3 sha256sums + one ripemd of the public key not single sha256 + ripemd. It's even harder than he makes it out to be.
@_date: 2015-04-28 13:14:04
You can't. The math involved is pretty hairy and requires a computer. 
You could do it with a programmable calculator which is actually a type of  computer too.

Compared to speculating on the price going up or down, which is what traders do all the time, this is pretty low risk.

No you can't. See this for a comparison of various HD wallets:

If the price of bitcoin reached astronomical levels a satoshi may be worth too much and you would need smaller units. So at that point in time you would increase divisibility. 
The price would be the cause and increasing divisibility one of the effects. It wouldn't happen the other way around.

No it's always lower than the other exchanges. This is an excellent arbitrage opportunity.
