Even if Yahoo bought Google for 1 mil back in 1998 I doubt it would grow into the same Google we know today. Under Yahoo management I'd be just another Yahoo search but with a different logo.

Can't you change the seed on your hardware wallet after your purchase it? I never used hardware wallets before so I have no idea how they work.
The other thing with hardware wallets that bothers me is that they may be potentially compromised by the staff that had physical access to these wallets in the store/depot etc. Everybody knows that this piece of hardware will be used to store large amounts of money so some people gotta have a  great urge to do something about it.

We're doing better the the Anonymous' prophecy foretold
HODL on!

This means that the 300k sats that each person should own on average should be worth $4200 instead of $30 that it currently valued. Of course we would need an overwhelming bitcoin adoption worldwide for it to happen.

Some scammy ICO probably...

How do you know he sold in 2017? He might have been happily selling all his bitcoins right after the bounce two weeks after he gave that interview back in 2013 while thinking bitcoin is never going to be worth more then $200. It really did look like a bubble back then. Most shitcoin charts look like this - one pump, then dump and then it would never see anything close to ATH. 
This may be the reason why Kevin hates Bitcoin so much. He kicks himself everyday for selling his bitcoins back in spring of 2013.

Decency aside this is a very logical thing for him to do:
\- if you want to buy something on the open market you must bash it first to knock down the price a bit
\- if you want to sell something on the open market you must praise the shit out of it to pump the price

I'm following Szabo on Twitter and yes, he seems to be supporting Trump. So what? His political views do not deny that he is an internet money genius and possibly part of a team known as "Satoshi Nakamoto". I skim through his political tweets and pay much attention to tweets about crypto

Articles image is a bit misleading IMO. Google street views gives a more realistic view of a country

10k by the end of the year? I'd say that's a pretty pessimistic prediction

Sorry for your loss, OP. 
First of all - did you download your electrum software specifically from [electrum.org]( website?
Did you install any other software on your PC from which you got your coins stolen? 
Did you open any files that were sent to you email by an unknown person?
Did somebody had physical access to your PC while knowing you were holding BTC keys there?

I wouldn't pay much attention to any market cap as it's a pretty useless metric

We are not going to 0 ever. I doubt BTC will be able to fall below $1000 in a hundred years even if we experience 3rd world war or something (which I doubt will happen). Too much adoption and exposure at this point. Too many people already rely on Bitcoin in their daily lives (mostly in failed state economies).

I like that you actually made glasses reflect stuff

Nice one. These dumb regulators should be forced to write regulations that are one page long or less.
