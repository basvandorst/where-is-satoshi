Thank you,i appreciate. I know there are lots of people that love me, that can keep me motivated but i regret this every single moment from when i heard that Bitcoin boom. I don't know, it seems that my mistake is hiding the love i had for life

If the value of  today would be still 0.00 i think i could have never regret anything but it's not 0.00..i don't know how to explain this felling,i'm a worker,i worked hard for everything in my life but i lost my faith and my passion for life

Do you think that in some years BTC will still be valuable?
At the moment i'm just hoping it falls to 0,just to try to forget about this story...

Thank you man,you deserve a hug
I know,you are right...i'm now just hoping for time to keep this regret away forever

Thanks man,i know i have to relax but its a sort of eye-opened dream. I keep dreaming something that i could have had investing, and that now i don't have. I don't want a  supercar,a big house,but a better life
I don't have any kind of health issue, but this regret keeps me feeling bad. I'm having a bad time looking into my past life but it is changing my nowadays life

I said i'm not beggin for money,i think that there are probably other people feeling like me and i want to share and see their experience

How can you "don't care"?
I can probably start again,but how?
You found your way to keep on going..i'm also trying that but somehow i cannot do it

I remember i mined 4 blocks (i think 1 block 50Btcs? back in early 2010) so 50x4=200 btc
I know that the first mistake is thinking i could have now some money...but i cannot keep thinking different

I know,i tried something to increase in a short term my wallet...just to see if there was a hope of something.
I know,i know that i keep hurting myself but it seems that i cannot stop doing it

Scammer?I'm not asking for money at all...

Thank you man,i have everything you said "You have your life, freedom, family and friends" except freedom...i'm a sort of slave of this mistake and it seems that i cannot find a way to get out
