Good work ! Nice to see some serious work on the details of this crypto. Vanity address generators have been around for quite a while and certainly have some appeal for business use. A 15 character vanity would be quite impressive but I presume this was generated "randomly" i.e. looking for a 15 character match of any match rather then seeking 15 specific characters. Has anyone got some examples of long vanity addresses which they have seen (or generated themselves) ?

Lol ! Sorry for your gain !! Mind you the neighbour I sold 90 BTC to at $1100 no longer speaks to me, some people just take money far far too seriously. It is, after all only a means to an end, it has no "use" in itself so however much you have written down in a ledger (decentralized or otherwise) it means nothing until you actually spend it on real world goods and/or services. In fact my neigbour with 90BTC is poorer than me with 0.9BTC because I spent mine on a nice new sports car (not a Tesla though !). He just kept his 90BTC and has not spent any of it.

So you are only interesting in the fiat profit (or loss). Shame on you ! It's people like you who have ruined Satoshi's great idea and turned it into a get rich quick scheme for lazy idle dreamers and/or lunatic political idealists. My advice is to sell and never come back, the whole concept of crypto is never going to get anywhere when there are people like you interested in profiting from it. The sooner it gets back down to $1 or so and stays there the better.

Have you ANY idea how big a mining farm would have to be if we made the processors out of tubes ? It would be so large you would need to put it on the moon. And you would be replacing tubes every microsecond. Also vulnerable to a side channel attack if you put a microphone near to the dumpster and listen to the dud ones being thrown in.
Just as an aside you do realize most households in the USA contain at least one vacuum tube don't you ? This used to be an easy question as we all spotted the CRT in the telly was just a big thermionic tube, but they have gone with the advent of LCD/LED/OLED or whatever. So where is that household tube hiding ?

Plus500 does not take exchange positions or hedge so irrespective of what the Plus500 players/traders do it should not directly affect any exchange. Unless Plus500 have seriously altered their spread/margin/quotes compared to normal operation there would be no "feedback" to signal anything to the traders either (which might make them take a position on an exchange directly as well as via Plus500 - unlikely anyway).
Plus500 annual reports will confirm this is how they operate.

If you give 1bitcoineater as a receive address to a butter he will see what it is and know what you are doing. You need an address that looks normal but one you can later show has burnt the coins. (i.e. like 1bitcoineater there is no private key). Therefore this can be generated from a hash of the character string 1bitcoineater (with padding if necessary).

The future could well be interesting for Bitcoin. I see two main possible scenarios for crypto-currency in the future.
1) An anonymous untraceable crypto which will be used for illegal purposes worldwide to buy goods and services.
2) A practically useful crypto which is easy to use, secure, and trusted by members of the public and has mass appeal.
At the moment Bitcoin can do neither. Although used for illegal stuff (e.g. drug purchase) it is not truly anonymous and untraceable as many users are increasingly finding out. Equally it cannot presently fulfil scenario 2) as it is not simple or secure and the appeal is poor owing to association with criminality , thefts, hacks and folded exchanges.
In all probability the winner(s) in future crypto-space may be alternative (to Bitcoin) cryptos for both 1) and 2). However we should not feel too unhappy about this, Bitcoin just happened to be "first to market" and was very rough and ready when it was born. Since then a huge amount of work has gone into crypto, and a huge amount of money. Something useful will come of this IMO but bitcoin itself has had its day now. Time to move on with better, different and more useful cryptos which are designed from scratch to actually solve real world problems properly.

But surely it is so so simple. You believe in the future of bitcoin but you know we are not there yet. You know, based on what has happened over the last 2 years, that it may take a little while (perhaps 2y-5y). Why then obsess about daily or hourly price movements. You have your stash, you are a true believer, just hodl, go away and do something else for nthis year, next year, whatever. When Bitcoin starts to take off you will know soon enough, it will be in the mainstream media again.
Put all your stash in nice cold storage, go get a life, come back later.
You are not really a true believer, you are a get rich quick (in fiat BTW !) idle dreamer. In which case please GTFO now and sell up. We can do without your sort in the bitcoin space.

Well the idea of crypto is interesting, it may very well have some important use in the future, bit too early to tell right now. Unfortunately the "first to market" (Bitcoin) has rather shot itself in the foot and turned into a croc of shit.
I put the blame fairly and squarely on all the bad actors, the criminals, scam merchants, thieves, hackers, convicted felons in places of authority, the malware blackmailers, vendors of drugs and porn. they get 80% of my blame. The other 20% goes to those of you who did fuck all about it. You knew what was going on, some of you could have reported these people and got them out of the bitcoin space, but no, you spouted a load of crap about freedom, libertarianism and sticking it to the man. So, no, it is not going to recover, it is ruined and largely many of you out there, whether white or black hat, must take a good proportion of the blame.

Speaking personally there is no hate for any crypto-currency or related project. This idea is really new and i expect loads more ideas to develop in time. Bitcoin itself just happened to be "first to market" in a sense but in the long run who knows what will emerge as the winner(s). If you are seriously interested in crypto-currency you won't be a hater of Ripple. If however you are a get-rich-quick lazy dreamer who went all-in on the BTC then if any emotional energy is left after you have cried your eyes out at the sub $200 price on the horizon I doubt you will be sparing it for hate on an alt. 
Of course this is a Bitcoin sub and some of the fanbase get a bit touchy about discussing altcoins and other ideas. Very short sighted really but who knows what percentage are really just shilling it up desperately trying to get back into profit. To be honest we could do without their sort on here.

Perhaps the criminal infestation of the bitcoin-space has something to do with it ? Scams and thefts are rife, we have bitcoin being used for criminal purposes, drug dealing , pornography and such. I did warn you all over a year ago that that kind of association would reflect badly on this cryptocurrency. I did advise you to make some effort to get rid of the criminals. And I even advised you to grass up to the police anyone you know who was doing anything illegal with bitcoin.(Thanks for the death threats on that one !).
Really you have only got yourselves to blame. You are NOT going to have a successful take over of the current system of finance with a bitcoin that is corrupt, infested with criminals and mainly used for drug dealing and blackmail, that, at least should be self-evident to anyone.
Is it too late ? Maybe it is. But let us try to at least do the right thing now. Some of you do know of criminal and dishonest users of this crypto. Please report them now to your local police. Maybe it won't save bitcoin but at least the world, and your neighbourhood may be a bit better and a bit safer for you and your family.

Price has nothing to do with it. what you need is to massively improve  bitcoin's image with ordinary Joe Public. To do this 2 things are necessary, remove the criminality that infests the bitcoin space, get rid of the association with drugs.
Both can be assisted by reporting any criminal / illegal activity to the authorities. Some of you are not criminals yourselves but do know of persons who are doing illegal things with bitcoin. Please report them now. Help make the world , and bitcoin, better and do the right thing.

I don't think we need lose any sleep over Bitcoin users who act illegally and then have their coins stolen. We need less criminality in this world so any karma effect that causes drug users to suffer gets my vote every time. also Bitcoin seems to be doing a useful job of catching some of the dealers too as they are equally idiotic and leave masses of clues for the authorities to follow in order to persue a prosecution. If both drug users and dealers get arrested, lose wealth etc, then perhaps Bitcoin really does have a future. After all the vast majority of the population are against illegality and want fewer criminals in their neighbourhood.

Don't use bitcoin for anything illegal or remotely dodgy for your activities are easily trackable by NSA/CIA/GCHQ any time they like as the forever record of the blockchain is always visible.
At the moment law enforcement agencies are concentrating on the "big fish" but when they have done that and have more time to spare you can be sure their interest will filter downwards toward the smaller fry and even individual small time drug dealers / users. The record of your activities is always available for anyone to trace and as the activity in Bitcoin increases it actually becomes *easier* to do so owing to increased linkages between users and further data leakage from other sources like exchanges which will identify you. 
This community, unlike the OPs assumption, is "supposed" to be interested in Bitcoin as a currency. It is NOT a community of people interested in illegal activities, drug purchases, dark markets, etc. This association has seriously damaged Bitcoin's trip to the moon. The sooner we all step up to the plate and take action to rid the bitcoin space of these criminals the better. 
If you know of anyone in Bitcoin-space doing anything illegal or immoral please report them to your local police right now. We can all help to make bitcoin a better and safer place and it won't become that unless the criminals are ousted.

Maybe, but unfortunately it has a high percentage of its population involved in criminality. Until this is removed there is no chance of bitcoin reaching mass adoption. The use for drug dealing and other illegal activities actually hampers the acceptance of bitcoin as a useful real world currency. We need to act now and get the criminals out of bitcoin. Please do your bit and report any criminals you are aware of right now ! We can clean up bitcoin if we act together.

Meanwhile back in the real world NSA and GCHQ continue to laugh at ridiculous claims of "anonymity" for Bitcoin as they carry on their project of tracking all kinds of criminals and drug dealer and, indeed, simple drug users.
The data base continues to grow daily of all those lovely blockchain links between users. Best thing Law Enforcement ever ~~discovered~~ invented.

Bitcoin is supposed to be a Honey Badger, picture may look a little different then !
@_date: 2015-03-13 20:16:34
As envisaged before Bitcoin was launched. One of the main "purposes" of the invention of this crypto was to facilitate the tracking of criminal and terrorist activity. Clearly as the size of the blockchain has evolved the linkages between various participants have become more solid and a very useful amount of data can now be extracted for use by NSA / CIA / GCHQ etc. I don't personally see this as an "attack" but more the natural functioning of the intended system.
If you have ever used bitcoin in the past for anything remotely illegal it would probably be a good idea to get out now and not leave any further traces, the longer you are there and using bitcoin then the greater the visibility of all your past transactions. 
We have not seen much activity regarding arrests or prosecutions yet due to the fact that law enforcement will naturally be concentrating on the "bigger fish". However when those have been dealt with I expect the activity to filter downwards to even the more petty criminals. And of course there is a nice incentive when your bitcoin stash has been linked with you, they can confiscate it !

@_date: 2015-03-29 14:23:06
Thanks for the heads up. I have sent your info to the relevant department. Nice to see someone taking my advice seriously - lets all continue to work to identify criminal activity in the bitcoin-space and pass the info to Law enforcement. Actions like this can only help make bitcoin a safer place for all and help get rid of the criminal infestation. Good work keep it up.

1) The bitcoin space is infested with criminality and dishonesty. Some of those persons work very hard on dissing opinions which shine a light in their direction.
2) Many so called "investors" are sitting on an unexpected loss. they are trying to shill it up and attract the next generation of bagholders.
3)There is a sub section of libertarian nutcases and druggies. Need we say more - you know what that means !
4)Lazy greedy dreamers. The dream of becoming insanely wealthy by doing fuck-all. How appealing !
5)The mods on this sub (go do some research if you don't understand).
6)500+ altcoins. 
7)Not a cult, not a cult, not a cult.
I could go on but hopefully thats enough of an insight to get you started. Don't forget to pay a few regular visits to keep up with the "alternative" viewpoint.

You have a simple choice:

2) Fly on an airline where all the pilots are smart, enlightened and empathetic recreational drug users (but not screened by their employer).

You are living in a fantasy world ! Society has already decided what is criminal and you are bound by that as much as everyone else in your town. As with any aspect of life a good honest citizen will do his best to help his local law enforcement by reporting criminal activity and acting to help stop it. This applies to Bitcoin as much as any other aspect of society. there is not doubt that there is a huge amount of criminality in the Bitcoin-Space right now and all honest law abiding enthusiast will want to see it removed. Lets all get together and see what we can do to make this happen. Less criminality must mean a better Bitcoin for everyone (except the criminals).

I love Bitcoin and cryptocurrency *as a technology* however it's progress to the moon has been halted due to a number of reasons:
1)Use for illegal purposes, such as drug dealing. 
2)Association with pornography.
3)Criminal elements who steal others BTC.
4)Criminal actors in Bitcoin Space who set up exit scams, etc.
5)Unregulated exchanges who fold and run off with your BTC
6)Blatent shilling on from hodlers still seeeing a loss.
7)Ridiculous encouragement to "invest" in this unregulated crypto because it will be worth millions later.
8)Blatent Ponzi types schemes such as deposit 1 BTC get 2BTC back next month.
9)Ridiculous association with mad political idea such as extreme libertarianism.
10)Stupid fantasy dreams such as how aliens on other planets can use blockchain technology.
11)Immature children posting rubbish about Bitcoin (too numerous to give an example)
12)A cult like, religious like mentality in this sub.
13)Blatent banning of redditors who dare to question some technical aspect of Bitcoin.
14)Mods with a vested interest, working for companies associated with Bitcoin.
15)Lack of understanding of the real world of finance and currency.
Apart from all those Bitcoin is great ! Perhaps if some of you could do something to get rid of the criminality things would look better. If you know of any actors in the Bitcoin Space who are doing illegal stuff with Bitcoin please report them to your local police now - we can all help to make Bitcoin better if we get rid of the criminal infestation.

What is a joke is the acceptance by bitcoin enthusiasts that association with criminality is OK. As long as criminals and drug users are associated with bitcoin in the minds of the ordinary Joe public there is no chance of mass adoption.

It's fundamentally due to a large percentage of bitcoin use being related to illegal activities and criminality. So as long as that continues there will be wild fluctuations every time someone manages to steal a big stash. What we need is to get rid of this criminality. It will be relatively difficult to modify the protocol along thses lines so probably the best bet is to grass up as many criminals and drug dealers as possible and get them removed from bitcoin as well as society. Perhaps then the ordinary Joe public will start to see bitcoin in a different light and associate it with cleaning up his neighbourhood rather than promoting and facilitating criminal activity.

I am suggesting we make a start on separating them, lets do our best to report the criminals and see what happens. If you are right then Bitcoin will fail and it was not worth having anyway, if you are wrong then Bitcoin will stand on its own feet and be held in much higher regard. Worth doing I reckon.

The "correct" value of anything with several active exchanges will be "about" the current exchange price at any specific time. Personal valuation is just adding *hope* to this figure. If you hope or expect it to be worth more at some time in the future you will tend to wait until it gets somewhere near that, or above it, before even considering selling.
So its all about psychology really. But if you are a bitcoin enthusiast, a believer in the future of this crypto then surely you will never sell, you will have bought so you have some for the new bright libertarian future.
If you are not a true enthusiast you will have bought in the hope of just making money, you will have jumped on the bitcoin bandwagon and don't really believe in its future. To you, those simply waiting to cash out, I say SELL NOW ! Bitcoin and cryptocurrency can do without your sort of profit motivated selfish parasites. GTFO and leave this crypto to the true enthusiasts PLEASE.

Look, it's an experimental new idea in money transmission. It is not, and never was, intended as a get rich quick scheme for lazy dreamers. If you bought it just to make money then more fool you !
Unfortunately the vast majority of you on this sub are acting like members of a cult or even, indeed, a ponzi. Perhaps if more of you had acted as interested in the real future of cryptocurrency, worked on some of its aspects, and kept your hard earned $ in your pocket we would have a much more practically useful Bitcoin trading at 1 or 2$ and the possibility of a future.
You have just fucked about with pumping it up, stealing it from one another, financing criminal activities and trying to make yourselves rich.
No wonder it is failing - all your own fault !
