Certainly not begging for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-04 10:27:26
Thank you
@_date: 2019-12-04 10:12:29
Thank you. You're right, they will back pay, it's just difficult waiting. Apparently there was a problem when I first applied. I resent all the info they required, but I'm still waiting.
@_date: 2019-12-04 14:39:49
Thank you.
@_date: 2019-12-04 14:35:54
Really. I'm not begging for Bitcoin, I was just mourning the loss.
@_date: 2019-12-04 12:37:05
Thank you. You're probably right. Onwards and upwards from here on in.

@_date: 2019-12-04 16:02:57
It's not. I'm just mourning the loss of my Bitcoin. I worked hard for my Sats.
@_date: 2019-12-04 09:26:15
Oh wow, that's harsh.
@_date: 2019-12-04 11:04:35
If I didn't feel it was absolutely necessary, I wouldn't have sold. I need money to get me through until social security payments begin. When I find a job I'll buy back in.
@_date: 2019-12-04 12:35:35
Thanks. Good advice
@_date: 2019-12-04 13:58:48
Thanks dude. I'm learning.
@_date: 2019-12-04 15:28:38
No worries.
@_date: 2019-12-04 13:38:25
Thank you.

I'm in Australia. I've been waiting 5weeks for social security payment, still no word when I'll get anything. Super stressed.
@_date: 2019-12-04 17:15:11
Really. I thought it's maybe time to buy more, if you can.
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:10:35
I'm not here begging....I'm here mourning the loss of my Bitcoin. I'll get it all back eventually, in my own time.
@_date: 2019-12-04 13:37:18
Thank you man. You are a champion.
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:42:07
Omg, I'm so sorry. That's awful. Are you ok? I have two kids, can't imagine losing them.
@_date: 2019-12-04 13:04:13
I'm confused. What do I do?
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:15:40
Ok. Believe what you will. I've actually discouraged people sending Bitcoin. But hey, you must know better.
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:47:57
I will man. Nothing means more to me than my kids. I'm sorry for your loss.
@_date: 2019-12-04 10:17:36
Oh god, I hope it's not 12 weeks.
@_date: 2019-12-04 13:22:39
At the time I was earning plenty and I thought it was a good idea. I didn't for a moment think I'd lose my job. Live and learn I suppose.
@_date: 2019-12-04 15:06:46
Yeah, I'm looking at Uber Eats or something....or maybe bar work. Whatever comes first.
@_date: 2019-12-04 10:47:07
Thank you. I'll explore that.
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:32:44
Yes, you are entitled to your opinion. But not everybody in this world is  asking for a handout. Yes, I received a little bit, about $3 worth. I didn't ask for it, and in fact I refused handouts from 4 other people. I only posted because I was genuinely upset that I've had to give up my Bitcoin after working very hard to collect that 0.1. And as for worse things in life, you are absolutely correct. I have, in the last 3 years, lost my wife, my dad and then my sister to suicide. Things can be a lot worse. I don't pretend losing my Bitcoin is the worst that can happen, but it did happen, and that's what my post was about.
@_date: 2019-12-04 15:32:31
I'm not giving up. Looking for work now, and hopeful of getting my Bitcoin back at some stage.
@_date: 2019-12-04 10:22:29
Oh really. I'll call them tomorrow. Thanks for the heads up.
