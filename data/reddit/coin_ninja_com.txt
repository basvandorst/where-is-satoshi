Boy, everybody is just in a mood today. Semantics over the name of the bank is irrelevant. On a crap day for the market, it's nice to see greater adoption of Bitcoin, especially when a bank sees it as a superior option over SWIFT. This is good news on this day of FUD, don't get it twisted my friend.

It's not about feeling bad for him, it's paying homage to him. The fact that it's a funny story showing the growth of Bitcoin's value and marking a historic Bitcoin purchase, makes it a good day to create a holiday and celebrate a bit. Lighten up, enjoy the meme flood and eat a pie, my dude.

Hi, DropBit is compatible with Android Lolipop and later, or iOS 11+
@_date: 2019-03-11 22:30:49
It is open source you can check the code yourself.
@_date: 2019-03-05 13:35:35
Hi, we currently do not support multi-sig, and we actually don't plan to implement that in the near future. It's very complicated for mobile. 
@_date: 2019-03-07 14:09:18
I appreciate that, but we would need an email to add you to our TestFlight list. Thanks you though. 
@_date: 2019-03-04 22:11:14
Thank you! We will be open sourced in about the next week, 2 at the most. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 16:50:53
I think it’s a great concept, and literally one that many of us at our company use. To further your point, we have developed a non-custodial Bitcoin wallet called DropBit that allows users to send Bitcoin to users who don’t even have the app via your Contacts, making it just one step simpler to get Bitcoin in to the hands of the previously un-coined. I know you’re in Europe, and our iOS app is currently available globally (soon for Android). Would love to hear if this is a helpful tool in facilitating your notion. Cheers
@_date: 2019-03-04 22:06:56
Hi, we have nested SegWit 
@_date: 2019-03-12 12:29:45
Hi, if you choose not to verify your phone number, you can still use DropBit as a basic wallet. You can scan a QR or copy/paste an address, you just won't have any Contacts-related features like sending invites to new users, or adding 2-way encrypted memos with your transaction.
@_date: 2019-03-12 12:26:56
Not yet, but it's a feature that upcoming. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 17:25:20
Thank you letting us know of the oversight, that was supposed to be injected at compile time and our repository will be reposted on GitHub accordingly. Preimage attacks are doable on nearly any hashing system, what makes this particularly accessible is the small keyspace. Our scheme is designed to balance privacy and ease of use without turning your phone into a handwarmer.
@_date: 2019-03-12 13:46:46
We don't currently provide support for building the application yourself. There are certain things injected at build-time that are not tracked in version control. As such, any build that you produce will not have the same signature as those on the Play store. In short, we do not support or provide reproducible builds at this time.
@_date: 2019-03-04 17:49:02
I like it; nice, clean and simple. 
@_date: 2019-11-06 15:16:52
1. Yes, biometrics are completely optional; the other option is to use a 6 digit PIN
2. Correct, a non-custodial HD wallet and a custodial Lightning wallet
3. Yes, you do not need to have the Twitter app enabled on your device to verify and send via Twitter
4. Good question, I will try and get you a better answer to this. 
5. BTC-LN has SMS and Twitter sending enabled. This method can be used to unlock another user's LN wallet, or send LN transactions. 
6. Actually, neither, we us a public/private key pair derived from your wallet, but is in no way associated with your Bitcoin wallet and addresses. There is no way to determine any info about your wallet from this key pair. We are open sourced, so feel free to check out more info here: [
Thanks for the questions, feel free to ask more.
@_date: 2019-03-12 12:51:17
Here is link to the repository: [ and we don't currently provide code signing. We aren't publishing the signatures for the releases in the App and Play Store at this time.

You're fully entitled to that. That's why we mention it in the request; this is for people willing to share that info with us in order to help us test. Thanks though

Thank you! ...Lightning is coming soon
@_date: 2019-03-05 14:43:30
I would suggest using our wallet, DropBit. Our wallet is non-custodial, so you own the private keys. Additionally, when you do decide to move that Bitcoin elsewhere, you can do that by merely sending to a contact already listed on your mobile device, and you can include a 2-way encrypted memo, which will make identifying the transaction much simpler. Find us for in the App Store or Play Store. Thanks, and good luck. 
@_date: 2019-03-26 15:45:09
As a representative of DropBit, I would also have to recommend giving us a try. We have a feature packed and simple wallet, with even more great features arriving in the near future. Hope you find what you’re looking for
@_date: 2019-03-11 22:30:17
All phone numbers are hashed , records of transactions are only kept on the server for 24 hours.
That being said, you will have to give up some privacy for ease of use.
If you want the price of bitcoin to go up it must be used by the masses. 
The masses can use this app and bitcoin easily with out even knowing what a bitcoin address is.
 This is the Venmo of bitcoin which is what everyone has been asking for lately and the thing that will spur adoption.
@_date: 2019-03-11 21:49:13
Dropbit launched 3 months ago. CoinNinja the parent company has been around for 8 months. 
The main feature we have which is lacking in other wallets is a non custodial way to send bitcoin through phone numbers instead of btc addresses. It is made for sharing bitcoin easily with people who don't understand bitcoin fully yet. It is safe and easy for them.
@_date: 2019-03-05 20:43:29
It's high up on our list, waiting on a couple of variables. 
@_date: 2019-03-11 22:49:17
No one else has a non custodial way of sending the transaction with a phone number.
We will be adding a feature to connect to your own node and lnd node in the future.
Your number is only link the a uuid for the request and once the address is sent to the sender it is deleted off our servers.
This is not a privacy based wallet. This is an easy of use wallet that your Grandma could use. If you are looking for the most private wallet I would suggest samurai .
@_date: 2019-03-12 19:00:13
I appreciate that, should be available globally for Android this week...additionally, you can include 2-way encrypted memos with your txs, which also makes this a very familiar feeling process to those more familiar with traditional P2P payment apps. Keep fighting the good fight!
@_date: 2019-11-06 19:07:44
Hi, we didn't want to force people to pay into our custodial wallet, which is why we cover the fee. But this is an option we have been considering in the future.
@_date: 2019-03-05 22:51:44
@_date: 2019-03-11 22:07:35
It is very secure. Additionally, we are available for both iOS and Android. For iOS we are now available globally, and both platforms now include 2-way encrypted memos with your transactions, which we think is a major help.
@_date: 2019-11-06 16:53:31
We should know by the end of the week when we intend to open all Lightning wallets. Right now however, someone would need to invite you; all they would need to do is send you a single sat. PM me, I'd be happy to unlock you :D
@_date: 2019-03-11 21:24:58
We're now open source. [
@_date: 2019-03-12 20:50:52
We are indeed
@_date: 2019-03-11 21:46:27
Once Alice verifies her number , the app sends an address to Bob and his wallet send the bitcoin. We never have custody of the bitcoin.
better explained here dropbit.app/dropbit
@_date: 2019-11-06 16:57:39
tldr: we don't use vouchers or codes
Actually, for an initial invite, you will get a notification that someone wants to send you BTC, and once you verify using the phone number or Twitter handle used by the sender (within 48 hours), then an address is served up and your transaction is broadcast.
If both users are verified, then the transactions are onchain, and function just as though you sent directly to an actual Bitcoin address.
@_date: 2019-03-12 12:36:54
Hello, we will be available in all countries very soon...very likely by the end of the week. 
@_date: 2019-03-07 16:27:47
Well, you'll need to enter your phone number to verify the app, once downloaded via TestFlight. The email was just to approve beta testers within TestFlight. We have all the participants we need at this point though. Thank you.

Pretty hard to argue against that; it's been changed. Apologies for any soreness of the retina ;)
@_date: 2019-06-18 17:49:29

That's right, this is old news, and they're just capitalizing on the OLD and long used name BTC, trying to piggy back on for their pie in the sky hope for the EliPay system and Eli coin. It most certainly is not a BITCOIN city...dare to dream
@_date: 2019-06-18 17:50:20
That right there is the importance of why having a non-custodial wallet is so important.
@_date: 2019-02-12 14:57:35
Exactly, you need to own those private keys of yours. Consider trying out the DropBit wallet, it's non-custodial (you are the only one who has your private keys), is easy to use, and has seriously unique-to-the-market features, like 2-way encrypted memos and the ability to text BTC to your contacts. Obligatory shill, out...but seriously, I hope you're able to get access to your coins from [Mobi.me]( all the best.
@_date: 2019-02-18 13:14:13
Maybe consider trying the DropBit wallet, also. DropBit allows you to use 2-way encrypted memos, which is really helpful in identifying transactions, like a pay check. Either way, very cool that your boss has made such an offer, if you can afford it, it sounds like quite a nice opportunity. Best of luck
@_date: 2019-02-14 16:39:25
DropBit App is making it easier to spend and send your Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-02-16 17:29:14
Check out the DropBit wallet. Super easy to use, you can send bitcoin to anyone in your contacts list, even if they don’t have our app yet. Also, for iOS and soon for android, you can include a 2-way memo, which makes using bitcoin more familiar feeling than traditional wallets. Find us in the App Store and Play Store, and we hope it’s what you’re looking for.
@_date: 2019-02-22 19:50:08
Hi, I would suggest checking out our wallet, DropBit. You can copy/paste BIP70 payment requests (BitPay requests) right into the address entry, and then fulfill the transaction. The payment memo is added to the transaction, the receiving address and BTC amount are all automatically entered. Check it out, available for iOS and Android. Thanks, sorry for all the BitPay nonsense 
@_date: 2019-02-28 17:36:31
open source is coming mid march
@_date: 2019-02-11 20:09:23
BRD uses some seriously low fees, so timing must have been bad, eventually it’ll get added
@_date: 2019-02-14 17:41:19
I would recommend our DropBit wallet! I'm saying this because you can send her Bitcoin/invite directly by just selecting her from your contacts in the app...the best part of all, you can send a memo with that invite (for iOS, Android soon), and can even use emojis to show her that it's more than just sending her Bitcoin, it's truly a heartfelt gift! Happy Valentine's Day to you both, and you can find us in the App Store or Play Store. :D
@_date: 2019-02-06 00:22:27
I’m in!
@_date: 2019-02-04 16:27:15
I would suggest trying out our DropBit wallet, available on Android (and iOS). Mycelium is decentr, but we have some unique features that they currently do not. Full disclosure, I work for Coin Ninja, and DropBit is our app, but we've put a lot of time in trying to make the most usable wallet. We have some very cool features coming soon which will allow you to use your Bitcoin held on our wallet. Just wanted to put that out there. 
@_date: 2019-02-06 14:40:53
I would give a DropBit a try; we are not yet connected with an exchange and open source is coming in this month, but we meet all of your other requirements, and have some other unique features to help you keep track of your transactions. Just yesterday we released a new update that allows you to send 2-way encrypted memos (and even emojjis, if that interests you). Either way, it's best to play around with what's out there (safely), and see what works best for your needs. 
@_date: 2019-02-09 20:24:18
Try using the DropBit mobile wallet, you can paste that BitPay payment (BIP70) request in get all the transaction info (address, amount, memo, fee) right in your wallet. Then you can send from DropBit, or copy the receive address to a different sending wallet, if you like.
@_date: 2019-02-09 20:27:17
Yes, it is definitely annoying, and this is just one reason why so many users take issue with bitpay. That’s why we decided to add this tool.
@_date: 2019-02-09 20:28:58
Yep, DropBit is also non-custodial, so you are the only one with the private keys.
@_date: 2019-02-27 20:58:01
Yes, try DropBit. You can now send Bitcoin by way of selecting a contact, now available in the U.S. and Canada. You can also add an encrypted memo with your transaction! Check us out in the App Store 
@_date: 2019-06-18 17:41:41
The transaction is not broadcast until the recipient has verified their wallet; the recipient's wallet will then serve up an address to the sender, and the tx is broadcast.
@_date: 2019-02-04 18:19:42
That's no good. We at [CoinNinja.com]( use a forked version of DeBitpay ([ So just for peace of mind, for anyone using our BIP70 Buster Tool, everything for us is executed client-side, and you can view our source code.
@_date: 2019-02-23 14:15:44
I would use the DropBit wallet. It’s really easy to use, you can send them the BTC as a gift even if they don’t already have the app, and you can do so by just sending to their phone number! The best part of all, you can include a 2-way-memo (message), to let them know it’s from you and anything special you want to say to them...even send emojis. Full disclosure, this is our app, but we think it’s great and perfect for what you’re trying to do. Great gift, on your part
@_date: 2019-02-20 11:23:39
DropBit Wallet is for iOS, and we have some excellent features unique to our wallet. “Text” bitcoin to your contacts, send 2-way encrypted memos, and the app is very clean and simple to use. We hope you check us out in the App Store, we think you’ll like it. 
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:12:15
The invitation will expire after 48 hrs., if it is not accepted. If you're having an issue cancelling an invite, please email us at [hello with any screenshots that may help us troubleshoot. Also, you may send us your debug info from the SUPPORT section of the menu. Thank you.
@_date: 2019-04-02 15:38:35
Our mobile wallet, DropBit, fits your requirements to a T. While you can get more convenient features by verifying your phone number, it is not necessary, nor is it necessary to back up your seed words, though it's recommended. Our interface is very simple and clean and as easy as it gets for send Bitcoin. Android Lolipop and iOS 11 are the minimum requirements, hope you check us out. 
@_date: 2019-04-16 18:27:04
It’s a bit of both, but most commonly they are brand new to Bitcoin and this is their first exposure to it, and how it operates; so it usually turns in to a teachable moment.

@_date: 2019-04-03 18:31:33
The DropBit wallet, which is our wallet, has used some of the nice features of both wallets. The difference is we have added many more usable features, and packaged it in a design that is as simple, clean and straight-forward as it gets. Check us out in the App Store and compare for yourself, we think you'll like what we have to offer. 
@_date: 2019-04-08 19:06:39

Well, the app I mentioned is our company's app, and I personally use Bitcoin for all of those things. I ask friends to accept when making small sports bets, or paying back for a meal, or just sending to a friend who does not yet have Bitcoin, and yes, I do buy gift cards through the app, it's pretty convenient. These are the functions we hope will drive the use of mobile wallets like ours. Making it simple and familiar should stimulate user activity, but it's still very new to most people.
@_date: 2019-04-12 15:42:45
Hi, for strictly Bitcoin I would have to recommend the DropBit wallet. Yes, this is our company's wallet, but we really have the simplest design out there, and an impressive features set, with new developments constantly being released. Currently available for iOS and Android, you can send 2-way memos, scan/copy/paste Bip70 payment requests and text Bitcoin to your contacts! In the next week we'll have Dust Protection and Send Max features. Also, you do not need to provide your phone number to have use basic wallet functions and we are available globally. We hope you give us a try.
@_date: 2019-04-04 12:37:09
Absolutely, you select the RECEIVE button, copy the address, and paste into Coinbase when withdrawing. 
@_date: 2019-04-05 13:47:27
Actually, you should try out DropBit, we expanded on what some of these more-established wallets have come up with, and incorporated some great features that are unique  to our wallet. Check us out in the App Store, I think we’re going to be exactly what you’re looking for. Cheers
@_date: 2019-04-03 22:54:42
The app is a noncustodial Bitcoin wallet, so the user is the only one with the private keys (seed words). The main difference is that you can send to others via your contacts, which makes the sending process very simple and familiar feeling.
@_date: 2019-04-16 15:36:49
Well, mobile wallets are great if you want the ability to use your Bitcoin for things like peer-to-peer transactions (use Bitcoin instead of cash to pay back friends, family etc) or if you use an app like our DropBit mobile wallet, you can purchase a gift card on the go, using the Bitcoin in your wallet. Additionally, you can send payments to Contacts already on your phone, even if they don't have the app; this is a feature you will not find on a desktop or hardware wallet.
@_date: 2019-04-15 18:27:27
Hi, you can view a map or list of stores which accept Bitcoin directly through our DropBit Bitcoin wallet app, or directly on Coin Ninja’s site: 
@_date: 2019-04-28 17:06:34
You should be able to “restore” with most wallets, which would allow you to add your preexisting seed. Our wallet, DropBit, allows you to do this simply, check us out in the App or Play Store.
@_date: 2019-04-04 03:24:18
A Ledger or Trezor are hardware wallets, which are great for larger amounts not needed to be accessed quickly. DropBit, and the others mentioned, are mobile wallets, for keeping bitcoin on you, and at hand.

This is a great thing to do(aside from taking a photo of seed words, but I understand). I do the same thing with my friends when playing/betting on board games. I use our DropBit Bitcoin wallet because we can send to others by just selecting a person from our phone's contacts, so even if one of my friends is one of the 'uninitiated' no-coiners, I can easily send them Bitcoin, and I can include a memo, letting me know why I am sending out this Bitcoin transaction. These small transactions between our peers is the best way to get Bitcoin to catch on with the newbs, and DropBit is an easy way to facilitate that.

We'd love it if you give our DropBit mobile (Bitcoin) wallet a try. It's available in both the iOS App Store and the Google Play Store (available only in the U.S.). We have some very innovative features (such as text Bitcoin to your contacts), and have been working very hard the past 1+ year on making it a clean, and slick interface. Bech32 support is coming soon, as well as some other unique features on the roadmap. To use the text BTC to contacts feature you do need to verify your phone number, but you can use all basic functions of our DropBit wallet without providing any personal info. We'd love to hear what you think of it, please add to your above list. Thanks

This is a strong suggestion and something we will look at doing.  Thanks for this.

Coin Ninja has released our own wallet, DropBit, which is available for both Android and iOS. DropBit takes some of the best features of other great, recommended wallets (BRD, Samurai, and Edge) and  adds some additional great features:

Do you have a link for this survey?

Screw you guys, I'm going home
@_date: 2018-11-13 19:47:13
You can use our wallet without verifying your phone number, and it functions as a basic wallet. The phone number is only required for some of our features. Why not just give it a try, then let me know what you think?

Fully agree, this is a good thing, though the intense sad music does make me want to cry. Let's shake off those dingleberries

yep, it's just a sms based app I made in a day. But it works good.
@_date: 2018-11-13 17:43:46
Currently we can only use U.S. phone numbers to verify for all features. We are adding international phone numbers in the near future.

We here at Coin Ninja want to sincerely apologize to  and any who read our article in which we stated that he is removing all mention of Bitcoin Cash from his book, "Mastering Bitcoin". Anotonopoulos responded firmly that our article was incorrect with an intent to be salacious, and for this, we are truly sorry. While we aggregate information to simplify current events happening in the world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, we are still responsible for fact-checking and getting the whole story before releasing information. Further clarification was made by Antonopoulos:
I removed 3 links to an explorer site that was serving up drama instead of transaction data. I replaced it with blockchain.info (you know Roger is an investor and board member right?).
I did not purge BCH or call BCH propaganda. BCH didn’t even exist when the book was published. In fact, I plan to add some info on BCH in the next edition, as the technical details are relevant. I purged drama introduced into a link posted in a textbook by a third party. That’s all. I told the block explorer to GTFO with their propaganda.
As we at Coin Ninja want to be contributing members to the expansion and improvement of Bitcoin and blockchain-related technologies, we understand that perpetuation of propaganda is counterproductive to informing those in the community, and we are truly sorry to have made this egregious mistake. 
Sincerest apologies,
Coin Ninja

Yeah, I caught that right after posting...but no way to change a Reddit post title. Alas

Having used ETH for many purchases online, I'd have to disagree with you. Also, the presence of the word Ethereum or Ether has little to do with the point of the article; context.

It's just for fun, we're not reporting to the IRS or anything. What's wrong with gathering consensus info from peers on how we all intend deal with this confusing situation?

As of April 1, Amazon does not allow purchases of cards/codes via gift card malls like eGifter or Gyft

It's a scam because they're using the appropriation of the name "Bitcoin" to mislead people new to the space to buy Bcash. There's no other excuse for this other than it's mal-intended trickery! It's shameful and should be actionable. Here, you want to buy some Japanese Yen, I'm going to call it USD on my exchange, what's the harm in that, why is everybody getting so salty. Come on guys!

You should consider sending your BTC to the DropBit app. Check it out here:  [
@_date: 2019-05-16 15:17:56
Check out the DropBit wallet, available for both platforms. Also, there's no person info required to use the wallet.
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:38:20
I would suggest trying out our DropBit wallet, which available on both Android and iOS. If your Samurai wallet was set to BIP49, you can just use your seed/recovery words associated with that wallet, and then recover that wallet on DropBit. However, if you used a different derivation path with Samurai (likely BIP44), you will need to access that from a wallet which supports that particular derivation path, then you could manually send them off from there.
@_date: 2018-12-18 19:56:13
Thanks!  Open source is high on our roadmap so won't be long.  You can some other pretty cool stuff we are working on in this post at the bottom.  [

Check out DropBit it very easy to onboard newbs to bitcoin. It is like Venmo for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-11 01:13:32
The DropBit wallet (iOS and Android) uses 8 decimal places...and has some other really great usability features. We hope you’ll check it out.
@_date: 2019-05-21 15:48:04
Yes, actually we do. Please check us out here: [
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:16:11
It's available in the Play Store and in the App Store.  Just search DropBit.   It's U.S. only right now so if you are outside of the U.S. it might not work.  But we're working hard on international support so coming soon!
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:18:33
1).  Aiming for Q1 of 2019 for international support.  It all depends on texting fees in other countries.  
2).  If you use the send to a phone number feature, the recipient needs the DropBit app.  However you can send BTC the regular way to a bitcoin address and it will go through fine.
3).  No users can't manually assign addresses to their contacts.  
4).  No we do not plan to support multisig anytime in the near future. 
5).  It does not support batching as that is an advanced feature and our wallet is geared toward increasing adoption of nocoiners and new bitcoin users.   
6).  Bech32 doesn't have the adoption so we don't want to convert our addresses quite yet.
7).  No, right now we only support 12 recovery words.  We follow the same derivative path BIP49 (many other wallets, like Trezor, also use this).

Bravo, this is excellent!

We **do not** store your contact list on our servers.  The only thing we store is a hashed version of your phone number so we can verify it.  Privacy is just as important to us as it is to you.  
@_date: 2018-12-13 17:17:35
with so much focus on price it's easy to forget how much good has happened to move us forward in crypto in 2019 and beyond
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:37:46
No problem, we get it and we are very similar.  Open source is on the roadmap and coming soon!
