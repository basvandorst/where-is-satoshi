Ok thanks

Right but it would be taxes on NET PROFIT right?
@_date: 2019-07-26 21:45:40
How do you calculate taxes? If you only make like $100 do you still pay taxes?
@_date: 2019-07-26 22:49:11
Cool. Now when does it become profit..if I am holding at end of year is it still profit of those holdings if sold at the time? Or only after selling do I pay taxes? And I am guessing it is total profit - total losses at end of year

Well I might have bought sold that much but only turned 100 profit. Do I pay taxes on the 100 or what I sold?

Coinbase pro is much better than coinbase cause of the 10x lower fees

For me it is mostly the supreme court ruling that the government has no legal obligation to protect its citizens.

Having control of a currency allows you some control over the economy it lives in. They can also charge fees for exchanging into that currency. The good nes is the more power and wealth they try and get from it, the more people will stay away from it. Tldr:power and wealth

Yea. This is a very old technique too. I wouldn't doubt if they could do this 30 or 50 yrs ago

Got in at 8720.
@_date: 2019-09-13 18:31:03
This means what?
@_date: 2019-09-13 19:33:08
Yea. But logically that would bring the price down...but I'm hearing the opposite
@_date: 2019-09-13 20:18:12
