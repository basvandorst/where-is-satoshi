Who said anything about whining?  Several concrete measures were taken to reduce GHash's mining dominance without any changes being made to the Bitcoin code (and there are plenty of risks associated with changing the code).  There was a DDOS attack against GHash recently which took them down to 6% of the mining rate temporarily.  There was also at least one miner claiming to be conducting block withholding attacks against GHash.  Both of these measures have the potential to directly remove GHash's ability to dominate the mining market, if they have not already done so.
Maybe someday the core developers will come up with a remedy for this problem (though I'm not holding my breath).  In the meantime, I'm pleased that the community itself has beat GHash back on its own.  Hopefully this will put them on notice that anytime they rise above 40% of the hash rate they can expect more of the same.  Hell, if they try it again, I'd expect the punishment to be even more severe.

Cite specific cases or it didn't happen.

While DDOS may legal in some countries, it actually may be more effective (and still 100% legal) to simply do a block withholding attack against unsavory pools.  I posted a simple patch to BFGMiner 4.2.0 over on  which makes it simple to turn this option on/off as you wish.

I guess we need a corollary to Godwin's Law relating to people comparing any action they don't approve of to terrorism.  In the USA 150 years ago it was illegal to help a slave escape his master.  Is it too much to ask people to think for themselves when it comes to deciding what is right and wrong instead of relying on some laws passed by politicians who rarely represent the interests of the people they govern?

You state that GHash has no ability to manipulate the market, but you do not back up that claim.  While there certainly is no proof that their recent spike in mining power was directly responsible for the recent drop in price, the coincidence of the spike and the recent drop in price makes it reasonable to consider it as a hypothesis.
A number of thoughtful people (like Peter Todd) have expressed concerns that the concentration of mining power in too few hands is a real threat to Bitcoin (see for example  ).  Dismissing these concerns with nothing more than your opinion and a link to a Bitcoin wiki is a weak argument.  Implying that those of us who are concerned are, "Freaking out," and in so doing causing the market to crash makes me further question your logic.

One thing not covered in the link you provide above is the ability to use a high percentage of the mining power to manipulate the market.  We have already seen recent evidence that the market is reacting negatively to GHash acquiring over 50% of the hashing power.  GHash can profit from this by timing their buying and selling to coincide with them spooking the market and the subsequent recovery when they relent.
But what I worry about most is the severe damage to Bitcoin's already tarnished reputation should GHash actually take advantage of their ability to double spend, reverse transactions, or block transactions.  Just because it isn't in their financial interest to do so doesn't mean it won't happen for other reasons including hacking, court orders, etc.  Bitcoin already has enough vulnerabilities in other areas but this is one that we can mitigate through community action on multiple fronts.

There already is a USAcon.  It's called the dollar.

Another perspective:
currency of the future indeed.  Nothing says confidence like a currency maintained by an active community of concerned users.

Cite the specific regulations (that give NY laws authority outside of NY), and the law(s) authorizing the regulations or you are spreading FUD.

I created a patch for BFGMiner 4.2.0 to perform block witholding attacks on whichever pools it is run on.  Use the command line option "--no-submit-blocks" to activate it.  Otherwise it runs as before.  The patch is here:  
Note that while I believe the patch to be correct, I have not tested it myself.  Caveat emptor.

Why?  You still collect payment in full for all shares submitted to the pool.  The only shares you wouldn't submit would be the one in a million (or so) that solved a block.  If enough people do this, they will make the pool unprofitable to run and unlucky to mine at.

Unable to come up with a retort to my logic, you resort to an appeal to emotion to attempt to steer the discussion in a different direction.  Pathetic.
BTW, I don't see your comments on threads comparing DDoS attacks to terrorism.

What about the people who violated the US Fugitive Slave law of 1850 and helped slaves escape from their masters?  I guess they were evil vigilantes who didn't allow the slave owners any kind of due process either, huh?
Stop preaching the law and learn to think for (and trust in) yourself when it comes to matters of ethics.  The world will be a better place for it.
The drop in bitcoin price from $650 to $550 during the latest GHash mining runup represents a loss in market capitalization of over $1 billion dollars.  The community has a right (and even a responsibility) to do what it takes to protect that value, up to and including civil disobedience.

2-3 years sounds very optimistic to me. If you took delivery of a brand new 40 GH/s BFL miner 1 year ago today, would it still be cost effective to run it today?

Lawyers of officers of the court, so when they represent you, they are constrained to only give you legal advice, even when the best possible action you could take may be extra-legal.
Before you hire a lawyer, you might want to talk to one, "off the record," and ask some hypothetical questions.  Once that's done, you'll have a better idea what you are looking at and will be better able to work with an attorney representing you.
Also there is a 10-year statute of limitations on the IRS to collect delinquent taxes.  If you aren't looking at fraud (e.g. criminal charges) and the amount is large enough, it may be worth your while waiting them out.
