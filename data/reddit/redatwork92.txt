They are testing it right now...
@_date: 2017-09-19 18:11:12
Yea, you wouldn't want dissenting opinion here... 
@_date: 2017-09-30 00:19:46
Ah yes, the good ol' if we use it... it won't work anymore argument...
Like there's just *noooo* way to deal with this...
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:19:18
Yet I used Bitcoin when that $0.8 beer would have cost me less than $0.001 in transaction fees...
Gee... no wonder people are looking elsewhere now...

The best thing I have found is to do a bank transfer USD -&gt; Coinbase.
Then hold the USD in coinbase for quick buy opportunities.
Or buy with credit cards and pay off.

Not sure if this is a vague threat or a reference I don't get...
@_date: 2017-09-29 21:08:57
@_date: 2017-09-30 00:23:31
but then I wouldn't be a *user* anymore...
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:51:35


Could you add support?
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:00:57
Maybe you haven't been paying attention, I just did. In fact it's the root of this comment chain...
[here's the link just in case you missed it...](


Maybe you should take your own advice...
@_date: 2017-09-28 19:59:05
Well that's just like... your opinion man...
The man abides...
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:43:40
Yes, free from blocksize limitations...
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:34:12


Only with constrained block sizes...
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:57:06


This shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the *way Bitcoin was meant to scale... from the very beginning*...
Bitcoin scaling *was always meant to be a race... a competition*. *That's what free market capitalism is...*


*The blockchain's size IS increasing...*
*The blockchain's size MUST increase...*
*The blockchain's size was DESIGNED to increase...*
Does this give you anxiety?
In order for the world to use Bitcoin it must increase e^x^p^o^n^e^n^t^i^a^l^l^y.
*Hence Bitcoin being a race*...
The problem comes in... when the people who can no longer compete blow up the bridge and *dig a moat*.
@_date: 2017-09-26 17:10:06
I would give you a tip but I can't *here*...
@_date: 2017-09-25 18:10:44
Only in does it take a conspiracy theory to explain why people want *low fees*...
@_date: 2017-09-28 19:45:56


Clearly you don't understand that **I** as a user, want this feature...
@_date: 2017-09-28 19:34:19
They could...
But they won't...
Guess user choice... doesn't matter...
Just their choice...
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:40:10


I see *no evidence of this*... perhaps you can show me some?
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:03:02
I'm sorry but your comment does not make sense in the context of this conversation. Are you replying to someone else?
^^Are ^^you ^^a ^^bot?
@_date: 2017-09-20 12:20:25
That's just what a bot would say...
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:39:12
No it sits until its included in a block.
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:39:53
People think the blockchain is going to *keep growing forever.... like a virus on my hard drive*...
The sad truth is even the majority of computer users *know squat* about the technicals going on behind the screen...
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:13:47


Oh no... I've failed to be clear...
What have I done... all this... and I've become opaque...
@_date: 2017-10-19 12:56:42


I'm glad to finally meet the Bitcoin authority...
@_date: 2017-10-16 13:19:18
It reads like someone (or something) else I know though...
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:12:49
Sounds about right, that's how I roll bruh...
I could give you the jelly hotline if you like?
@_date: 2017-09-30 00:04:33
I see what you did there ;)
@_date: 2017-09-28 19:41:23
Maybe they should do a poll :)
@_date: 2017-09-19 18:35:13
Can't help you there :(
Tried contacting Coinbase support?
@_date: 2017-10-19 12:38:54
*Look see... it's not broken...*
But if you use the network *your a spammer*.
