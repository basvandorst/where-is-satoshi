It's a good point and that's why it'd be good to get guidance from Givewell or Animal Charity Evaluators.
I'd be interested to know if $80M+ would make a significant dent on the cost of a QALY. The Against Malaria Foundation raised close to $50M last year and they're still up there at Givewell as the most effective. Considering the 400k+ malaria deaths per year and the efficacy of net distribution maybe it is still more effective to just distribute more nets.
Edit: [Looks like the AMF could easily use hundreds of millions](

Downvote this guy all you want but he’s actually right. Everyone told the Pineapple Fund guy to research Effective Altruism and donate to the poorest people in the world but no, he donates to the richest.

What they're doing is great but maaan it bothers me how retarded humans are!
Like instead of just not consuming animal products, we have to lab engineer something similar so people can ween off what they're used to eating. Spending valuable donated money in the process.
But I guess being effective means we need to take account of the human condition.

OP, research Effective Altruism! Please! Do not waste your donations on first world ‘charities’. The amount you are donating can actually save over 20,000 human lives or millions of animal lives! Givewell.org

I'm sure the 400,000+ people who died from Malaria last year simply because they didn't have a $2 mosquito would prefer the net over the MDMA.
Philanthropic money should be used for the most effective causes first i.e. ones that save more lives per $

Generous of her/him but it’s sad to see that the money went to ineffective charities. Think of how much good could have been done if it was used to help the poor instead of the rich.

The charities chosen were dog shit. Researching the use of MDMA?! 400,000 people die each year from malaria because they don’t have a $1 bed net, but MDMA gets priority cause drugs are cool mmmkay
