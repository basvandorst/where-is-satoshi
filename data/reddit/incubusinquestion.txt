How did you? Asking for a friend.

These are the enemy of bitcoin, any bitcoin they have is leas the people can use. I wish we could exclude them like they have the rest of the world when they manipulate the money/wars to their benefit. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 21:02:40
No doubt, but if I had my way .. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 04:18:39
Not unless, default - then moon?

I find it ironic you started your response with DYOR. Conspiracy hard hats required from this point on. Conspiracy by definition requires motive and accomplices. When you delve into the elite defining reality requires so much empathy, it's a world you or I will never know, and they want it to stay that way.

Those services can be provided independently/privately, however, because of the existence of govt. subsidies (unethical laws too) and monopolies we have crappy corporations like comcast and coal fired sources of power. 
It's called an oligarchy.

The govt. doesn't control money, the central bank of the US known as the Federal Reserve controls the US money supply and much of the country as a result. 
Now, the owners of the central banks around the world are the real power players that want control of the world (including war, bc war = profit to very sick people). 
The idea behind bitcoin allows for purchasing power put back in the hands of people/users or bitcoin. This is a powerful idea, it's like the idea of feeding two wolves, one is evil and one is good.

Bro, so meta.

Next question: Is trading considered a transaction? Say I trade BTC for ETH, is that also taxable?
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:56:06
Priorities, man.
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:10:56


Which do you use?
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:42:53
Does this only apply when you "cash out" (in fiat) or is the BTC being monitored and are you subjected to report those earnings relative to the price in your country's fiat?
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:38:53
It is counter intuitive to decentralization for one.
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:34:52
But the BTC has been purchased on the exchange with the third party now obligated to report (presumably). So, my question is, why wouldn't uncle Sam come calling to ask where your Trezor is hiding?

The best investment advice I've ever heard was to buy low and sell high. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:03:28
Do you not concur?

Nobody is (or maybe should) use Las Vegas as justification. That place is a nightmare for natural resources efficiency of use.

Full disclosure: from the US .. but, I'm asking for a friend. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:47:06
I get the big banks and the governments confused sometimes ;)
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:04:20
I feel like infrastructure would be better supported. Maybe we could focus on scaling and more macro problems. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:59:06
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:06:16
Valid, I like to challenge people if things should stay the same just because it's how things are. I think this new crypto is really promising. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:50:31
I get the feeling a lot of people will need help with this.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:49:18
Greenhouse gasses prevent solar energy from escaping the earths atmosphere, some gasses are more potent than others. It makes me think of where the electricity is coming from. If it's renewable, moon baby, but it feels prudent to understand the whole truth of bitcoin and crypto currencies including their environmental impact. I'd feel like such a dick driving my Lamborghini when the rest of the world is fighting over food.

zing, have an upvote .. sadly no gold, saving for next buy in
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:16:33
Me too, almost identically.

I suppose while we are launching to the moon we can also launch a few dedicated satellite arrays to create our own bandwidth (or rent from some other company).
@_date: 2017-09-12 00:40:13
Bitcoin noob here (too). Is this good?
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:27:24
What wallet do you use?
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:34:29
Yeah, poor choice of words. I don't think crypto is going to replace governments, what it will circumnavigate is the power relationship between governments and the issuance of money. It will enable real value to exist again. 
I would argue that the century long adoption of the modern fiat currency we use today has warped our ideas of value, but this rubber band effect caused by technology like the blockchain and crypto and a free internet based on satellites has real potential to redefine value and would enable a global freedom from the power relationship between the evil oppressive and maybe necessary (for now) governments of the world and the evil usury created by the necessary (for now) banks and fiat system.
Just my two Satoshis.
@_date: 2017-09-22 19:20:12
Is this true? I haven't found a good definitive source on this, can I mine btc still after segwit2x ?
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:33:55
Huzzah, more credibility for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-19 02:13:00
To temporarily halt the real fall, yes. But by that time the bankers have moved their holding to bitcoin and the rest of the country/world is royally flushed. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:16:33
Me too, almost identically.
@_date: 2017-09-23 05:49:26
So, which ones do we mine lol.
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:35:24
Can I PM you to learn more about this method? I am having a hard time figuring out how to exchange btc to fiat and back in a timely manner.
@_date: 2017-10-12 00:58:34
noob here, so this is .. good? 
@_date: 2017-09-29 13:50:32
It is now!
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:13:03
It's hard to speculate geopolitical futures especially when we are talking about disruptive technologies. The strange irony is that the more we talk about it, even make fun of it, the more robust it can become. It's already become an inconvenient middle man to the us and china because those fiat currencies have the most to lose. 
Im really excited to see what other countries embrace the tech.
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:39:12
nah brah, but the accountability would be nice no? I like the idea of future governments using smart contracts and a globally recognized currency to pay for stuff. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 01:09:52
Do you know where I can find said Linux distro? Can you point me in the right direction?
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:15:49
Gainz bro. 
I don't like the environmental impact it has on the planet.
@_date: 2018-07-08 06:11:21
Does this mean there is (roughly) 1/4 of a million usd flowing through the LN as transactions at any given time?
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:36:38
Would love to hear what you find!
