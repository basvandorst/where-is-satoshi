Multi-party shared databases that no one controls weren't a thing.

You're very sure a project with tens of thousands of lines of code will remain a vaporware project?

Did they have a consensus process operating across databases with root access from multiple independent parties? No.

Everyone here assumes banks are making the bank version of bitcoin. Maybe this is Citi's fault with Citicoin, or goldman, or UBS (although those are both for settlement), or more likely they just don't understand what banks do and what they want the tech for. I will bet anyone here that it's unlikely to be a blockchain for end users to make payments.
@_date: 2016-01-18 05:42:03
Why? Permissioned ledgers could still use blockchains. They're just not as highly censorship resistant blockchains.
@_date: 2016-01-19 05:37:48
What the hell are you talking about...
@_date: 2016-01-18 01:11:42
Chained blocks aren't blockchains?
@_date: 2016-01-19 05:39:14
Ha. Good point. Not what I meant but you got me.
@_date: 2016-01-18 05:45:58
Well reasoned.
@_date: 2016-01-18 06:26:30
I'm afraid I don't really understand what you mean.
@_date: 2016-01-18 01:08:23
are you a parody of junseth?
@_date: 2016-01-18 01:07:32
Or getting the Fed to issue fiat dollars directly onto the R3 chain and making it accessible only to commercial banks with access to central bank money...

You know Jae was talking about "entropy" and you misheard him and attacked him for it, right?
@_date: 2016-01-18 01:14:11
So what? They're not trying to solve the same problem Satoshi was so why should it fit his premise?
@_date: 2016-01-18 05:44:27
I appreciate the reply. Well thought out, reasoned and cited. Thank you.
@_date: 2016-01-17 00:01:49
He quite clearing said "on the trading side not much". Which was a direct response to the question regarding Nasdaq. Most of these companies aren't looking at trading, they're looking at settlement. So he's right...
@_date: 2016-01-25 19:30:03
Yeah... I don't expect most people on to get that but Marc should.
@_date: 2016-01-18 05:47:38
I genuinely don't think they feel the need to hobble Bitcoin. Bitcoin's no where near the size needed to get on the radar of serious concern. It's greed driving this, not fear, they saw something that solved one problem and realised they could use something similar to solve something much bigger (more profitable) that can be done today.
@_date: 2016-01-18 05:50:14
How are bitcoiners still saying this? Do you genuinely not see the difference between a database that one entity has total root access to and a permissioned ledger that multiple parties can interact with but not unilaterally edit?
@_date: 2016-03-27 17:38:42
And are tendermint and HyperLedger even related?
@_date: 2016-01-18 05:49:03
You didn't read what I wrote


You don't have access to central bank money. This is all behind the scenes boring stuff that has to happen to allow the economy to function. You shouldn't care about it and it doesn't compete with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-18 01:10:39
This is so lazy. Bitcoin could just as easily be the next AOL.
@_date: 2016-02-12 19:06:21
Because multiple institutions involved in the settling of that equity don't have as much complex interactions and reconciliations between them.

Doesn't being an IaaS company mean you are selling cloud services by definition?
@_date: 2016-02-12 19:05:21
But not the purpose of other blockchains...
@_date: 2016-02-13 04:21:15
You need to define that way more specifically. If you do, you end up with something that resembles a clearing house, or something that resembles CLS or DTCC.
Other entities still need to keep local copies of that data. They still need to reconcile against that. That is a simple example. I don't mean to be patronizing, but anyone who has good solutions to these problems isn't hanging out in stating the obvious. If you understand these problems you aren't saying "hurrr durrr, use a spread sheet". The problem for bitcoiners is no one that actually understands these problems is taking the time to educate bitcoiners on these problems, because they have better things to do. Like solve these problems.
@_date: 2016-02-17 17:30:01
Yeah, it's nothing to do with Ethereum either.
@_date: 2016-02-17 17:32:55
That makes no sense.

What are you talking about?
@_date: 2016-02-12 21:33:11
Amazing that people are suggesting that all these institutions just share a spreadsheet on Google Drive...

Not an alt(coin) but an alternative. Has some pretty giant companies: 
@_date: 2016-02-17 17:28:24
Yes, several of them are blockchain specific companies... Others have been investing and investigating for years.
@_date: 2016-02-09 22:30:36
@_date: 2016-02-23 01:05:38
@_date: 2016-02-17 23:44:36
Maybe 6 months ago. People are over that now. Most enterprise/finance (IBM relevant) conversations about blockchain don't refer to/mean/use bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-12 19:08:56
Even with those middlemen between the middlemen, a blockchain can still make that process more efficient without displacing anyone.
@_date: 2016-02-17 23:43:28
Only that it's in golang
@_date: 2016-02-09 22:28:11
It would if they had any need to peg it to bitcoin, which they don't.
@_date: 2016-02-12 19:08:00
I've sat on both sides and believe me, the bitcoiners don't understand the bankers far more than the other way around, as evidenced by people here talking about currency.
@_date: 2016-02-21 23:06:20
Yes, you could just take a snapshot of the state of bitcoin (or announce you will for a future block) and reissue a fixed issuance token on another chain to the same private keys. In theory.
@_date: 2016-02-17 23:45:18
Riiight. Gonna assume you are a troll and move on!
@_date: 2015-09-28 03:28:47
You guys are kinda obsessed... It's a bit weird.
@_date: 2015-09-10 05:38:35
UBS' Utility Settlement Coin and Clearmatics
are the same thing
Blythe Master's Digital Asset Holdings (DAH) and Hyperledger
are the same thing
@_date: 2015-09-12 06:47:23
Exactly. I don't know why so many on here trot out the same old obviously lines like the parent to your comment without thinking how banks could miss these. They haven't missed them, they've just solved them...
@_date: 2015-09-12 06:49:16
Ironic you call Bitcoin the "gold standard" when that's exactly what they don't want. Bitcoin's trying to solve different problems than they are, why do people think they'd consider using it?
@_date: 2015-09-10 07:31:34
Why do you think Symbiont are secretly using them?
@_date: 2015-09-12 19:06:51
Decentralization isn't the end goal, something useful is. Something quasi-decentralized across dozens of hubs may well end up being way more valuable and practical (and can evolve much faster) than decentralization for decentralization's sake, and all the trade-offs you need to make for a widely decentralized system. It's no more vulnerable to DoS than the existing systems, much less in fact. Electrical attacks?
@_date: 2015-09-11 23:13:57
That sounds like HyperLedger
@_date: 2015-09-12 06:52:15
Used or planned to use. Is this still the case? I thought they said something about a private blockchain more recently.
@_date: 2015-09-11 23:01:27
Bingo. Don't know why this is so hard for people on here to get.
@_date: 2015-09-12 06:45:53
Why couldn't you have 100 banks, no miners, encrypted transactions? Arguably more decentralized than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-12 06:50:55
I don't really see the point of using a blockchain purely internally, even bitcoin companies like coinbase don't bother doing this. Regular databases are much better. But a blockchain between multiple banks where you have to be a bank to be a miner/validator makes a hell of a lot of sense.
@_date: 2015-09-12 22:37:34
Why would all the validators be in the same physical location? Even if they are, as some have to be for trading, these are pretty damn secure.
@_date: 2015-09-28 14:11:31
Occasionally. And every time I do you talk about him.
@_date: 2015-09-22 03:54:41
Not 21, Inc., but I guess their reply would be:
The problem with Bitcoin today is not everyone has access to it, and it's complicated for those that do. With the new Bitcoin Computer, we solve these problems. Here's how: we initially release a crappy looking, expensive generation 1 version of our Bitcoin computer aimed at developers, enthusiasts, and gadget lovers. Gen 2 is a lot cheaper. Gen 3 cheaper still. Gen 4 is embedded inside your laptop and you don't even know it's there. Gen 5 may even be in your smartphone, fridge, or, fuck it, toaster. Then who knows? We've got shit loads of bitcoin producing devices by default, smart people will do smart shit on top of it and we'll take a small cut from the pool. Oh, and hopefully the bitcoin price will go up, a lot, to make this worthwhile, and it happening will help push up the price. Or we'll sell none and go bankrupt. It's an all or nothing punt, that's why VCs like it so much, they make there money on the one dumb sounding idea that works.
@_date: 2015-09-12 22:39:07
"based on the open bitcoin protocol" is different from using the Bitcoin Blockchain itself. Could just mean a private fork which is interoperable. The only mentions of using Bitcoin itself are on the media section, which is hardly a proof.
@_date: 2015-09-23 03:13:14
I've heard it. If it were less shit it would be quite good.
@_date: 2015-09-28 03:28:58
@_date: 2015-09-22 03:43:34
is a buttcoiner...? He's one of the most narrow minded bitcoiners on here
@_date: 2016-10-25 04:46:55




Maybe a third


@_date: 2015-09-12 19:03:03
Yeah, but it was from May 18th. That's a long time ago in this space.
@_date: 2016-10-25 04:45:42
"gets everyone on board as the standard". Future tense. Very plausible.
@_date: 2016-10-24 01:49:09
Yeah, this is a good play by them. Will be very interested to see the code.
@_date: 2016-10-24 01:49:39
The one where 42 banks use it?
@_date: 2015-10-04 08:12:12
Meh. You're on the losing end of the battle.
@_date: 2015-10-13 23:52:48
So even though he's from a private ledger he's still saying Bitcoin could win in the long term.
@_date: 2015-10-08 20:00:19
Then you're insane.
@_date: 2015-10-20 11:22:11
If they're a lot smarter than you and have a track record of being insanely successful, maybe they're not talking Bullshit...
@_date: 2015-10-30 09:14:28
No. They're genuinely not using bitcoin. Sticking a hash in the bitcoin blockchain buys you next to nothing, even if it only costs two cents.
@_date: 2015-10-07 05:10:49
A branch manager. Wow.
@_date: 2015-10-14 00:56:57
Dude, if you're consulting banks you should at least know that Hyperleger is from Digital Asset Holdings, not R3. They are different things...
Bitcoiners hate Hyperledger because it was designed to solve a different problem, a problem they don't understand.
@_date: 2015-10-05 02:14:27
It's not...
@_date: 2015-10-07 05:13:43
Go pitch colored coins to banks...
@_date: 2015-10-29 20:59:14
Yeah, I'm not sure what's wrong with this. Perhaps should be "the blockchain", if not "Bitcoin". I don't think Hyperledger is technically a blockchain. They seem to call it just a distributed ledger.
@_date: 2015-10-05 02:17:18
If it's not the bitcoin blockchain, it doesn't.
@_date: 2015-10-13 01:33:12
@_date: 2015-10-07 05:05:20
What is? What they have or what they want? They have proprietary DBs for IBM and the like. They want open source permissioned ledgers.
@_date: 2015-10-04 18:53:23
They don't give a shit about it. If you want to separate state and money then you have to make all of the design decisions that bitcoin did. If you don't, then you don't. It's madness to think "I want to create a deflationary currency not controlled by governments" and "I want to improve the clearing and settlement process for banks" would arrive at anything near the same solution.
@_date: 2015-10-05 02:16:15
See my other comment:
@_date: 2015-10-30 00:15:03
Permissioned mp3 distribution sites like iTunes will never work, permissionless bittorrent is the future!
@_date: 2015-10-07 05:09:56


OK, think of permissioned blockchains as OSX.
@_date: 2015-10-04 08:11:31
They're really not doomed to failure at all. Decentralization at all costs types like to think they are because they solve for different problems. If you want a government level censorship resistant blockchain then you need to allow anonymous miners and incentivize them, but banks don't so they don't. Bitcoin solves for a very specific problem, many here like to pretend that's not the case.
@_date: 2015-10-29 21:01:03
They don't use Bitcoin so they'd deserve to win diddly squat for lying.
@_date: 2015-10-12 23:24:17
RIAK isn't BFT...
@_date: 2015-10-13 02:11:34
BFT and sybil prevention are two different things. Are you honestly saying that proof of work is the only BFT solution?
@_date: 2015-10-04 18:49:52
Right, and iTunes solved a different problem with similar technology that didn't have an issue with being shutdown and ended up being much bigger.
@_date: 2015-10-08 19:58:26
I'd assume it'd be using Bitmain's pool, just like 21's use theirs.
@_date: 2015-10-13 11:33:28
Because it's disambiguated from their product, BitTorrent.
@_date: 2015-10-04 18:58:57
I think there's a certain element of talking past each other, a bit of ideology (although this seems to be very confused as bitcoiners want to bypass banks and get pissed when banks don't use bitcoin), and some blind hope that they'll get rich off the asset appreciation which won't happen if people don't use it.
I also saw a few comments on here of people complaining that the permissioned ledger people do a very bad job explaining themselves. Why should they do a good job? People in aren't their target market. Banks don't buy things based on whitepapers. They're holding private forums. Meeting one on one. Whatever you think of Goldman Sachs, they are not stupid. Far, far from it. If they didn't see the value in permissioned ledgers they're not going to be duped by charlatans, let alone all the major banks in the world.
To me, bitcoiners complain the other side are missing the point when ironically there is more than one point and they miss all the others except for the point of bitcoin. Yes, you can't separate bitcoin from the blockchain IF a, b, c. If you don't care about a, b, c the of course you can.
Personally, I believe in both and I don't see any conflict there. Bitcoin will continue to grow for what it was designed to do and permissioned systems will get adoption for what they were designed to do. One day maybe bitcoin will adapt and solve for some of the issues that prevent banks from using it and then maybe they will. Maybe it won't and they won't. For now there is a "fork" of sorts with blockchain branching to solve two different problems. Bitcoiners should probably much prefer this in the medium term than banks trying to takeover or co-opt bitcoin and turn it into something else.
@_date: 2015-10-30 01:25:26
Wait, so maybe there are different solutions for different needs...? Holy shit...
@_date: 2016-10-24 01:47:44
You need more than two talking points.
@_date: 2015-10-13 11:34:23
Blockchain.info didn't develop the Blockchain. BitTorrent developed BitTorrent.
Another really bad example.
@_date: 2015-10-19 21:01:39
Bitmain. In New York too. Their logo is tiny in the bottom left corner.
@_date: 2015-10-20 10:35:48
How is that the same?
@_date: 2015-10-13 02:09:16
That's a really bad comparison :)
@_date: 2015-10-06 23:28:30
They have multiple centralized ledgers that all need reconciling. This is not what is meant by distributed ledger as it's not shared or replicated and some entity always has root access.
@_date: 2015-10-21 13:24:35
Have multiple units of account, each created for a specific instrument. Like ripple IOUs or blockstream native assets.
@_date: 2015-10-21 13:16:32
Why can't they just record the digital assets natively? 
@_date: 2015-10-13 23:55:11
More miners = harder to do a sybil attack. Group of (say 40 banks) have permissioned ledger = no possibility of a sybil attack = no need for proof of work = mining/validating is cheap and done by the banks themselves = no need to incentivise them directly.
@_date: 2015-10-04 08:12:57
Napster sure is neat and useful, but it would be so much better with Apple's centralization.

Huh. Only saw the twitter, thanks. That seems crazy but maybe a lottery does make more sense than a loss on electricity. Would have thought it'd be configurable.
@_date: 2015-10-07 05:15:20
Would you rather own Napster or iTunes?

What are you talking about? What altcoin?
@_date: 2015-10-07 05:13:10
They're not asking Joe Schmo on to use theirs. They're planning to use theirs behind the scenes, you'll never know about it.
@_date: 2015-10-06 23:27:06
I don't have a hugely strong or more than lightly informed opinion on the block size debate specifically. I think there's a lot of nonsense going on on both side but believe that the Blockstream guy's probably do have bitcoin's best intentions at heart and aren't hampering it to sell their own fix, that would be crazy.
I don't think it is as vital as you say though. I see bitcoin's potential in the long term and it will have to be solved at some point, and there will probably need a short term solution soon, but there isn't going to be a mad rush in the next few years.
We've been through the hype, that brought a lot of people in, now we're going through the trough after the hype and a lot of people will leave. That doesn't mean it will die or won't ultimately be successful. It will keep plodding along around this level for a few years. Maybe 2, maybe 5, maybe more. It's still really, really early but a datastore that no one controls is something fundamentally new and I believe will be valuable in the future. Banks may not use it, merchants might not accept it, but something new will probably emerge at some point. Long slog, I'm holding out for 5 years minimum.
