In what way?
@_date: 2014-04-18 00:00:45
It does.  Funds were stolen despite 2FA.
@_date: 2014-04-18 14:25:00
Yes, the problem is Google asserts 2FA codes cannot be stolen from a phone like LBC says.
@_date: 2014-04-18 12:25:11
I have responded to your comment.  See above.
@_date: 2014-04-18 01:16:37
It's not good news.  We have more and more reports of theft and no good response from the staff.
@_date: 2014-04-17 20:24:36
While it's good that they are responding, IRC people are calling their statement bullshit.  Like myself, may have 2nd factor enabled who where affected.

The attacks appear to be targeted and **do not require a user makes a withdraw**.  High visibility buyers and sellers seem to be getting hit.
Based on discussions with other victims, malware has been almost certainly ruled out.
Whoever is launching these attacks clearly doesn't (yet) have the capability to do so en masse, but I would be **extremely hesitant** to use localbitcoins with any significant amount of money until this is fixed.

Yes, I love the service.  Its simple, quick and seemingly safe.  Hopefully they will fix this issue and refund those hurt by this.
@_date: 2014-04-18 01:32:27
How many and when?  Forums are reporting a full hold.
@_date: 2014-04-18 00:32:48
Or both... :'(
@_date: 2014-01-12 18:45:23
Solution: Use thicker paper, or perhaps even security paper. :P

This is not related to malware.  I am operating on unix and this is hitting far too many high value sellers.
@_date: 2014-04-17 19:42:56
There is a real security issue.  I wouldn't hurt the market by posting if this wasn't an urgent matter.
@_date: 2014-04-17 20:33:03
Agreed. Rewording.
@_date: 2014-04-17 19:29:05
I did...
@_date: 2014-04-18 01:14:26
I love how in the block post they put an asterisks.  It really inspires confidence...

FLASH: LBC admin confirms reports, now investigating... 
@_date: 2014-04-17 17:03:54
Reports are streaming in now.  This is not an isolated event.
@_date: 2014-04-18 00:01:48
Absolutely, but that doesn't help dealers who move a lot of volume.  They are required to have (relatively) sizable balances to utilize the escrow system.

@_date: 2014-04-18 05:09:05
I would deactivate and withdraw, pending an announcement.
@_date: 2014-04-17 22:01:51
You have to have coins in your wallet to sell, due to their escrow system.
@_date: 2014-04-18 12:40:16
Motorola Droid Maxx HD.  Still have found no malware on this one week old phone... Still looking.
@_date: 2014-04-17 20:28:29
I read it, but they are blanket discrediting these reports when in fact they appear to have no clue as to what is going on.
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:52:55
Agreed.  Unless it's not XSS and it's an inside job.  People should DISABLE JS AND WITHDRAW.

What is your username?  I want to pass it to admins to cross-reference.
