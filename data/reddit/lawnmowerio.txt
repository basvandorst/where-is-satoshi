We figured many hadn't actually seen our app in action so wanted to give people a quick peek. We'd love to hear what you think about our design, layout, features, flow, etc. Also, to preemptively address limited banking support questions - we are currently working quickly to expand this out dramatically (beyond the 8 large US banks we currently support). More information on everything on Lawnmower.io and we do have an Android app - the demo just happens to be in iOS :)
*** After much request, here's a half speed video -

Before the burns begin, we're all very aware we are awkward and terrible actors :)

Check out  - Lawnmower's a super easy way to purchase small amounts of bitcoin over time instead of trying to time the market with one off purchases. You can use just the spare change on your purchases (with or without custom multipliers) - for example, you can link up a major US debit card, go to a restaurant, spend $15.25, and set aside $.75 to purchase bitcoin.  
@_date: 2015-06-15 23:33:50
Definitely a tame month...
@_date: 2015-06-24 18:21:40
Hey Maxxit,
We use Plaid (plaid.com) for the transaction history of the spending account you hook up to Lawnmower so we can calculate the spare change for each purchase. We just watch this account - never touch any funds, withdrawal, etc.
The spare change to bitcoin purchases are made through Coinbase (using the account linked to Coinbase) - and we only use the spare change amounts from your transactions to initiate bitcoin purchases to go to your Lawnmower wallet.
For more info, the Coinbase API allows application developers to request specific permissions depending on what the application needs to do. In Lawnmower's case, the only permissions requested are:
user: so LM knows your email address and can communicate with you
buy: so that LM can buy bitcoin for you
balance: so LM can show you your balance within the app
transfers: so LM can check the status of buy orders it has placed
Thus, Lawnmower cannot send nor sell your bitcoin at any time
Here's a link to the screen within the Lawnmower app showing you this I just took -  
Lawnmower is very secure using leading APIs (Plaid and Coinbase) with limited permissions - the bare minimum to watch your transactions and buy you your indicated amount of bitcoin over time.
Happy to answer any additional questions.
@_date: 2015-06-10 22:32:36
We're exploring options but the core service will always be free :)
@_date: 2015-06-23 02:26:52
Sounds like you've connected a bank account to Lawnmower for us to watch for transactions / spare change. You also need to attach a bank account (it can be the same or different) to Coinbase - which will be used to actually fund the bitcoin purchases. You can get to / manage both of these accounts through "Settings" on the app. If you still ever have trouble after reading lawnmower.io/faq we're always happy to help at support :)
@_date: 2015-06-10 23:56:30
We're exploring options but the core Lawnmower service will always be free :) All bitcoin purchases are initiated within your Coinbase account however which currently charges $.15 for transactions &lt; $15 and 1% for transactions &gt; $15. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 09:41:07
Thanks a lot :) We want to support as many international banks as possible, but details will depend upon the banking support offered by the 3rd party API providers we use for transaction data.
@_date: 2015-06-19 08:24:04
Thanks, we're doing well and working on expanding out our banking support as wide as possible! Ideally we'd like to support as many international banks of all sizes that we can, and our next major priority is working on these integration details :)
@_date: 2015-06-23 18:12:26
Roger - thanks for the DL and hope you can hold out until we can support your financial institution!
@_date: 2015-06-17 06:30:17
Woooo! Great to hear :)
@_date: 2015-06-19 18:40:32
Yup, DCA is cool and easy way to smooth out the effects of volatility - on your returns and mental state :) For a low-commitment and passive DCA-esque option to help distance yourself from daily bitcoin price concerns, check out Lawnmower.io which uses just the spare change from your purchases to buy bitcoin over time.
@_date: 2015-06-23 04:16:19
Awesome, working on it!
@_date: 2015-06-19 08:33:30
Thanks a lot. So our banking support is currently limited to 8 major US banks by the 3rd party API we use (Plaid) for transaction data. We're working quickly on expanding out to international and smaller financial institutions to support as many users as we can :)
@_date: 2015-06-10 21:58:45
Lawnmower ( is an app that helps you convert your spare change into bitcoin in a super easy and passive manner. We just released an update with a cool new interface and some anticipated features :)
@_date: 2015-06-26 17:18:24
Great to hear and Ally is definitely on our list and highly requested!
@_date: 2015-06-28 17:34:38
alternatively... use just your spare change and passively buy small amounts over time with Lawnmower.io :)
@_date: 2015-06-16 23:17:22
Check out Lawnmower.io to buy small amounts (like the $10 - $20 per month you were considering) over time. We link to an account you spend with (credit/debit card or checking/saving acct) and a Coinbase acct and "round up" every purchase you make to the nearest dollar (e.g. a $3.75 purchase has $0.25 of spare change) to set aside for bitcoin purchases. We also have a spare change multiplier feature (think 0.2x or 2.0x what your spare change would have been) to let you customize how much you save over time and a customizable minimum purchase threshold to let you control the timing of your bitcoin purchases and mitigate the associated fees. It's (hopefully) a cool, easy/hands-off way to acquire bitcoin over time, and the frequency of the purchases helps smooth out the effects of bitcoin's dramatic price volatility on your returns :)
@_date: 2015-06-10 23:51:56
Lawnmower is a separate company. All Lawnmower users must log into or create a Coinbase account to use the app though, and all bitcoin purchases are made and held through Coinbase so most regulatory compliance is handled by them.
@_date: 2015-06-23 05:32:20
5x - the multiplier will be applied to whatever your default spare change would be for the purchase. The minimum is .2x, so for a sandwich that cost you $3.50, a .2x multiplier would get you $.10 ($.50 * .2) of spare change to go towards your bitcoin purchases. If you had the multiplier on 5x for that same sandwich purchase, you would get $2.50 of spare change ($.50 * 5).
@_date: 2015-06-19 18:38:28
Absolutely. We're currently restricted by the 3rd party API (Plaid) we use for transaction data, but plan on dramatically expanding out our banking support out soon. We hope to be able to support users across the world that bank at various sized financial institutions :)
@_date: 2015-06-26 05:05:30
Check out Lawnmower.io - a super easy way to accumulate bitcoin over time using just your spare change :)
@_date: 2015-06-11 02:25:47
The spare change is essentially accumulated until it reaches a threshold you can set. So let say your minimum purchase threshold is $10 - you have that 75 cents of spare change from your cup of coffee, then as you go about your normal spending through the next week you accumulate another $9.25 of spare change - at that point you're buying $10 worth of bitcoin with a 15 cent fee.
@_date: 2015-06-23 18:11:19
Sorry for your confusion, we're trying to make it as intuitive as possible. So the icons/timing work like this - A clock means its pending (on the banks end - the spare change has not been used for anything yet), the coin stack means the transaction's done pending and the spare change has been used to add to your aggregated spare change (spare change accumulates until your customizable minimum purchase threshold), and the check means that transaction's spare change has been used in a bitcoin purchase.
You can see your accumulated spare change working towards your next bitcoin purchase in your stats. The timing from when we initiate a bitcoin purchase for you (when your accumulated spare change reaches your minimum threshold) and when the bitcoin will reach your Lawnmower wallet is dependent on Coinbase (and the ACH network, etc. to fully send the funds to purchase the bitcoin) but will likely take a few days. Here's a simple explanation of the what's going on with the dashboard if it helps - 
Happy to help if you have any more questions at support :)
@_date: 2015-06-11 01:55:42
Awesome, thanks a lot! The option for $0 or $1 of spare change on a whole dollar purchase could be an easy setting choice, and advanced analytics on both the spending and savings sides would be definitely be cool as well :)
@_date: 2015-06-11 04:08:53
There's a bunch of info on Lawnmower, Inc. on the internet, here's a few easy links -  &amp; 
@_date: 2015-06-24 00:07:49
Awesome, thanks a lot and good to hear. We're working on adding additional banking support quickly - and super high chance you'll be in our next large batch with a large bank like SunTrust :)
@_date: 2015-06-17 03:37:47
Understand and absolutely :) Our banking support is currently limited by the 3rd party API we use (Plaid) for transaction data. We're working quickly on expanding out to credit unions and other smaller financial institutions to support as many users as we can.
@_date: 2015-06-10 23:46:35
Nope, not exactly. You link account(s) for Lawnmower to watch for transactions and calculate spare change. When your spare change accumulates to a minimum threshold you can set, we initiate a purchase for that much bitcoin with the account you have linked to Coinbase (which can be the same or different from the account(s) we're watching). The purchases are through your Coinbase account and the bitcoin is sent to your "Lawnmower Wallet" held within Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-06-11 04:26:00
but then how would we work in this sweet new gradient lol :)
@_date: 2015-06-11 04:19:20
If you look towards the bottom of our About page ( you'll see some press snippets, each linking to a longer form article which names us all several times. We wanted to keep the webpage as concise and focused on the product as possible.

Lawnmower.io has a sweet iOS app for accumulating small amounts of bitcoin over time using just your spare change!
@_date: 2015-06-23 05:35:42
Awesome suggestions, will definitely need to think about some of those a bit more :) We've thought a bit about some rule based purchase options in the past and think added customizability options are awesome features to add in for our users in general. We really appreciate all the support and check out this half speed video -  !
@_date: 2015-06-24 04:46:35
What $1.50 fee are you talking about?
Coinbase's transaction fees are $.15 flat for purchases under $15, and 1% for purchases above.
Lawnmower's minimum purchase threshold slider lets you easily choose between $4 and $20. At $4, the fee is less than 4% of the purchase, and at $20 it's 1%.
@_date: 2015-06-22 08:07:03
everyday :)
@_date: 2015-06-11 06:30:48
Unfortunately it's not right now :(
@_date: 2015-06-17 04:12:27
and if you're not going to use bitcoin, at least convert the spare change from the ticket into bitcoin with Lawnmower.io :)
@_date: 2015-06-10 22:14:31
On the way! Working as fast as we can to support as many banks as possible. Definitely our next major priority.

@_date: 2015-05-03 21:56:31
Additional banking support is our next big project we're working on :) It involves integrating a more expansive transaction data API - heads up though, we'll likely move from 5 banks to thousands
@_date: 2015-07-06 15:10:40
Check this out - Lawnmower.io. An easy intro/way to start saving bitcoin using just the spare change from your everyday purchases :)
@_date: 2015-04-24 02:23:11
Yup, pretty much. The bitcoin purchases will be executed with the account linked to Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-04-09 22:02:53
Quickly working on expanding out our supported banks!
@_date: 2015-04-24 06:46:12
Yup, we can watch credit card transactions at the banks we support.
@_date: 2015-04-24 21:42:13
Yup, absolutely - integrating with a more exhaustive transaction data API with much wider banking support is the next major push on our list :)
@_date: 2015-04-24 02:21:04
PNC's been highly requested and will definitely be in the next large batch of banks we support.
@_date: 2015-04-24 07:42:13
Thanks a lot. We accumulate the spare change until it's &gt;$4 before initiating a bitcoin purchase. 
@_date: 2015-04-09 13:32:30
Thanks! We've got a decent Android version we're testing internally. You can shoot us your email for updates about the Android version and the beta we should get rolling soon [here](

We need to integrate with another exhaustive transaction data API but we're moving fast. Heads up though - when we do, the supported banks number will likely move from five to thousands :)
@_date: 2015-04-24 06:49:36
There are no fees or advertisements and we're not making money right now
@_date: 2015-04-24 06:55:33
We're pretty new but check out [this]( recent Fortune article and [here's]( a review by CoinDesk
@_date: 2015-04-24 01:26:35
Nope, even easier, just buy it with the credit or debit card you have linked to Lawnmower and it'll get picked up and reflected on your dashboard :)
@_date: 2015-04-10 00:44:32
USAA and AmEx are the next 2 banks getting Lawnmower support - stay tuned!
@_date: 2015-04-27 04:12:44
@_date: 2015-04-24 18:21:45
Hey and thanks a lot for both your reviews. We've heard the suggestion to customize the minimum bitcoin purchase threshold several times (and it's definitely in line with our vision of giving users added options to manage and control their funds/savings - like the spare change multiplier feature we recently added.) Thanks for the suggestions and we'll definitely think a bit about this and other related features in our next update pushes :)
@_date: 2015-04-24 01:16:38
Thanks! No catch, apps free to download and use but since bitcoin purchases are executed through Coinbase you'll still pay their transaction fee (15 cents for orders &lt;$15) - which we mitigate through accumulating spare change up to $4 before we initiate a purchase.
@_date: 2015-04-17 09:06:08
Hey there! We're happy to address your concerns. 
See the post from about how we interact with your Coinbase account. Just to reiterate, Lawnmower is **not able** to send your bitcoin.
On the banking data side, we use [Plaid]( We never store your banking username/password. Plaid handles all communication with your bank.
For more on security at Lawnmower, see [our security page]( and [FAQ](
Please let us know of anything else we can do to earn your trust :)
@_date: 2015-04-14 03:07:29
You could have Lawnmower watch the CC and set up a different account (debit, savings, or checking) just for the actual bitcoin purchases. Other than that the purchase fees are on Coinbase's side.
@_date: 2015-04-09 22:02:33
Lawnmower will calculate the spare change for any transaction that hits your linked spending account. For example, if you have a Chase account linked to Apple Pay, use Apple Pay to pay for a $3.25 coffee (with the Chase acct. in the background), Lawnmower will still record the 75¢ of spare change.
@_date: 2015-04-24 18:18:13
We're planning on expanding out investment and money management options to give users a bit more customization in regards to their savings :) Kind of broad but stay tuned - we have some pretty cool ideas!
@_date: 2015-04-09 19:27:35
Yup, you're essentially right. Our service is similar to a recurring buy except the actual amounts and timing is variable (linked to your spending habits). Above and beyond the psychological side of slowly accumulating bitcoin with something as small as "spare change", the frequency of the purchases also helps with the volatility / smooth your cost basis. Instead of buying $50 at once (which could be right before a large price fall), you could make say 10 smaller purchases, so purchases are executed at the tops and bottoms of the peaks/valleys and you can start to distance yourself from the price drama.
@_date: 2015-04-24 06:48:42
[Here's]( a recent Fortune article
and [here's]( one on CoinDesk
@_date: 2015-04-14 01:55:22
Just to clarify - there are 2 separate notions of "account" here: 1) the account we watch for spare change data (which can be a credit card, debit card, checking or savings account) - which has no fees, and 2) the account that Coinbase uses to actually purchase bitcoin (which can be the same, or different than the watching account side) - which has standard Coinbase purchase fees (plus any extra for a CC purchase like you mentioned).
Hope this answers your question! Happy to clarify anything else. :)
@_date: 2015-04-24 04:01:03
Nope, we're using Plaid
@_date: 2015-04-09 19:30:42
Apologize for missing a quick description:
Lawnmower helps you convert your spare change into bitcoin. 
Buy a coffee for $3.25 and turn the remaining 75¢ into bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-04-24 01:38:18
Lawnmower links your spending and savings habits. The automatic, small, and frequent purchases let you accumulate bitcoin in a very passive and hands-off manner. We want to let you distance yourself from the price volatility and thinking about/actually making purchases, or trying to time the market :) 
@_date: 2015-04-08 10:17:12
Check out Lawnmower.io, an app we made that does just this - let us know what you think!

Hey TotalMelancholy,
We've been pushing out our beta in waves over the last few weeks to users who requested an invite on our site (Lawnmower.io) - we've been sending users an invite via iTunes Connect/TestFlight along with a quick email describing the sign-up process within our app. We've had a few threads and articles lately I'd encourage you to check out to see some of the feedback we've received from our users, and hopefully our About and FAQ pages can answer most your additional questions. Happy to provide any explanations, details, etc. and let us know what you think about our product.
@_date: 2015-03-24 22:17:58
We currently support: Chase, U.S. Bank, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and Citi. We've received many requests for additional banks and we're looking to branch out as soon as we can.
@_date: 2015-11-16 17:37:41


@_date: 2015-10-15 05:08:37
Where are you attempting to download the app from? 
Also, as a side note, we currently only support US based users on the platform, we have had some people have issues finding the app due to that issue before. 
If you want to reach out to support we can look more into this as well. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 02:46:19
When your spare change accumulates to the threshold or higher we initiate a bitcoin purchase for the total amount - so if your total spare change balance is $19.75 and you make a purchase with $0.75 worth of spare change, we'll initiate a bitcoin purchase for the whole $20.50.
We make some money referring new users &amp; volume to Coinbase and are working on some pro-plan and similar ideas.
@_date: 2015-03-25 00:53:52
Basically, except the timing and amount of your bitcoin purchases are variable (based on what you spend) instead of a fixed $ amount on a fixed time interval.
@_date: 2015-10-15 00:01:29
We should have a list up on the site within the next day or so - wanted to get this update out to people as soon as possible. If you dm/reply to me with your bank I can check if it's supported and get back to you A$AP.
@_date: 2015-03-24 22:03:54
We've started rolling them out in the last few weeks and plan on ramping the invitation volume up very soon.
@_date: 2015-10-15 21:06:20
Hey there,
1.4.7 is the newest version on the app store, we will be releasing it under the 2.0 version number in our next update.
Do you have the newest update? 
@_date: 2015-10-15 06:20:45
The bitcoin purchases are not factored into the original transaction amounts - as far as we know, this is not possible. Instead, as you spend, you accumulate spare change amounts (we literally calculate the spare change on each transaction and sum it up) until you hit a certain threshold ("Spare Change Threshold"). Once you hit this threshold (default of $6, though adjustable), a bitcoin purchase is initiated through your Coinbase account. This will show up as a separate transaction on your bank statement (as COINBASE). Lawnmower **does not** include transactions from Coinbase in its spare change calculation (including bitcoin purchases initiated by Lawnmower itself).
For bitcoin purchases under $15, Coinbase charges a flat 15 cent fee. For bitcoin purchases over $15, Coinbase charges a 1% fee. To mitigate these purchase fees, you can adjust your "Spare Change Threshold" within the Lawnmower app to buy at smaller/larger amounts as you prefer (which means you'll be buying BTC more/less often, respectively).
@_date: 2015-10-15 05:10:18
Unfortunately the $5 sign up bonus is only for users who are brand new to Coinbase and to Lawnmower so in this situation your account would not be eligible. 
We have plans to release a referral program that all users can take advantage of. We are still working out the details but hope to have something out in the near future :)
@_date: 2015-03-24 22:41:13
Lawnmower itself is free to download and use. 
As bitcoin is purchased through your Coinbase account, each spare change to bitcoin purchase is currently subject to [Coinbase's existing purchase fee] (
To help mitigate these fees for our users, we essentially watch until your accumulated spare change exceeds $4.00 until we initiate a bitcoin purchase.
@_date: 2015-10-15 15:48:07
We will take a look into it, if you haven't already it's support look forward to hearing from you.
@_date: 2015-10-15 17:27:15
We do not charge anything on top of the Coinbase buy fees.
Currently we make a bit of money referring brand new users to Coinbase as we explore a few longer term ideas we have to generate revenue without putting off or overburdening our users.
@_date: 2015-10-14 23:47:48
Hey there,
Shoot us a support email over to support and we can look into what the issue might be. We will make sure to get your account back into working order :)

Just pulling from an explanation further up in the thread :)




@_date: 2015-10-14 23:59:15
Thanks for the love! Out of curiosity, what kind of options/features do you have in mind?
@_date: 2015-10-15 16:45:50
That is actually not where the promotion is coming from. The $5 promotion is a separate Lawnmower specific promotion that we are allowing users both brand new to Coinbase and Lawnmower to receive. 
@_date: 2015-10-15 15:47:42
Hey there, 
Thanks for reaching out! This is currently a known issue that we are working towards resolving. We are hoping to have a new update out to apple / google by the beginning of next week that has fixes for Navy Federal Credit Union, hope to get you onboard soon. 
@_date: 2015-11-15 23:50:07
No good timing estimate but we're working on a solution for international banks and currencies - would love to go global and Coinbase is already supported in many countries :)
@_date: 2015-10-15 07:28:08
Unfortunately right now we are only available in the United States. We have plans to expand internationally but do not currently have a set in stone date or areas that we will be moving towards first. 
@_date: 2015-10-15 00:37:04
Thanks, really appreciate the support! 
Navy Federal CU is supposed to be supported with this recent integration we are just currently sorting out a few issues with it so it should not be much longer. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 22:36:45
That's definitely part of the beauty of Lawnmower, you can distance yourself from the volatility knowing you're making frequent small purchases regularly - even through the dramatic price peaks and valleys.
@_date: 2015-10-15 00:32:33
We plan on adding something to the site where users can search through our list of banks soon.
Unfortunately right now we only officially support users in the US, thought we are working as fast as we can to bring international support to the app. With Coinbase recently launching in Canada as well it should not be too long of a wait :)
@_date: 2015-10-15 21:07:41
Right now we are only able to support American Banks, we have plans to roll out internationally but no solid time frame as to when currently. 
Canada will most likely be one of the first expansions considering Coinbase now works there as well. 
@_date: 2015-10-01 16:29:38
We're just finishing up internally testing a very large banking integration. All of them (except maybe Quicksilver?) should be supported very soon :)
@_date: 2015-10-15 08:01:14
Currently we do not work with other wallets than Coinbase. Once the Bitcoin hits your Coinbase wallet though you are always free to move your Bitcoin where you like.
No current plans for other wallet integrations as of this moment.
