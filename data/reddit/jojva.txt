This would be a nice progress.
I think we all agree that a.) some level of moderation is necessary, and b.) yes, moderation is a fine line to draw. But the line is currently in censorship territory. I mean Theymos even openly admits it is. The main problem, imho, is that most of us don't understand why increasing the block size is an issue. I haven't seen a single post this far that makes a good case for stalling the block size. To me, the situation is like this: there is a nice cake on a table across the room, and the Core devs are drawing a circle around us telling us: "you can't get out of the circle, it's for your own good". Yet we can't see why it's for our own good to stay inside the circle, and there is nothing preventing us to step outside of it.
Theymos is wrong, and history will prove it.

This seems very reasonable. If lite clients can't adapt today to a simple hard-fork, I don't understand how they could adapt to any hard-fork.

The thing is, if libertarians and anarchists do not accept compromise, Bitcoin will never grow beyond this niche. And I'm afraid that at some point, some big company will just create a new altcoin with huge marketing campaigns and people will fall for it. It will be mostly like Bitcoin, it will use the terms 'decentralized' and 'trustless', but it will be monitored by that company (I'm thinking Google, Apple or IBM).
If we want to avoid that it's better to reach out now, get a damn massive user base even if it means taking risks. That's what a company would do, and that's what Bitcoin should do before it's too late.

Every case made against BIP 101 has been about how it may increase centralization, and these are not enough to justify the stalling in my opinion. The benefits of a block size increase are way over the drawbacks.
About the public mod log: I would love to give you feedback if you described it in more details and presented it to the community. You will obviously face a lot of negativity and downvoting but that's normal, this is Reddit.

@_date: 2015-06-27 13:46:01
Actually, I think this would be a nice darwinian selection. Or am I missing something? Because it would be stupid for the core developers not to incorporate a massive sidechains (without much thought, let's say as much activity as the main chain, 50/50) into Core.
@_date: 2015-06-11 12:00:45
I see. Thanks for your answer.
@_date: 2015-12-01 13:45:23
It's a really nice start. A 24 hours delay seems largely enough to settle on any issue. If I understand correctly, the link would be provided by mods? Or would it be freely accessible somewhere? I'm far from being an expert with reddit moderation.
Also, although I understand the fear of witch hunt, there should be some sort of accountability with removals/bans. These are never light decisions and they should be motivated, the most vocal troublemakers are few in the grand scheme of things.
And to answer about the block size, bitcoin's decentralized properties have always been priority number 2 for me. What I mean is that first it should be functional, public, ready for the masses, then we can care about extreme decentralization. I say extreme decentralization because I think it is already a very decentralized project considering the numbers. A friend of mine has been building Movim, a decentralized social network, for ~8 years. The result is that the main node of the network has more than 95% of all the users. Bitcoin is doing much better in terms of decentralization, and I think it is already a huge success. But I don't believe it will get much better, no matter what we do, and that has to do with human nature (I can develop if you want). If you take a step back and look at the big picture, the ordinary user won't run a full node, this will be let to big servers across the world, as Satoshi predicted (this is true for miners, but this is also true for non-mining full nodes). Keeping Bitcoin small enough that LukeJr can run his full node on his personal computer and his low-speed internet connection is irrelevant imo (not personally attacking him, it's just an example).
@_date: 2015-06-11 06:52:18
Why would it be unethical?
It's not about judging them, it's about having some metrics like any tracker would.
@_date: 2015-06-27 11:33:42
This is also why I can't wait for sidechains to be natively implemented in Bitcoin Core. This will allow isolation of the different philosophical and technical theories, while still sharing the same base unit.
@_date: 2015-06-11 06:58:37
I see, so it is still possible on an individual level by counting the nodes surrounding you.

One of the reasons is that 1 microbitcoin is 100 satoshis. This gives 2 decimal places prices, like fiat currencies (say 1.56 bits: 1 bit and 56 satoshis). This of course goes with a lot of upsides, easy to handle for human brain, almost every software managing money uses 2 decimal places, etc.

I have trouble understanding what exactly the waiting periods are for in sidechains. The paper states that the confirmation period builds 1 or 2 days worth of PoW to avoid DoS attacks during the contest period. Can someone ELI5 this to me? It seems to me that this simply delays the DoS to whatever the confirmation period is set to.

It will take some time but I think we'll eventually get there. The question is when.
As an example, Linux is an excellent OS though few people used it for many years. Now that Google has developed Android, a lot of people use it without even knowing. I expect there will someday be powerful services built around Bitcoin that will make it invisible but still there.

The anonymity (actually pseudonymity) may be appreciated in some communities, but some others do not care.
I think the main reasons Bitcoin has a future is because it is **programmable** internet money, coupled with the fact that it **cannot be controlled**. These two properties make it extremely easy to invent and develop some crazy experimental stuff.

That's very interesting. I will not talk about CT rangeproofs, which I don't know enough about yet. But you're saying "the on-chain scalability is limited to initial block download and catch-up", well that makes tracking the chain almost as easy for everybody doesn't it? If my super slow computer can't validate a block quickly enough, I will eventually receive the next rangeproof and catch-up to it. So we're playing a game of cat-and-mouse, what would be wrong with that?
It would mean the limiting factor in scalability is the most powerful machine on the P2P network.

You're not downloading a videogame or the last VLC video player. You're downloading your own banking system, and all the security rests with you and the software.

Yes that's how, like you, I understood what "fixed reward" meant. But it's been in the README file since the initial import, or 4 months.
Edit: I just understood what you meant. Yes I saw that discussion, but what I'm trying to say is that communicating *outside* of developer circles would be a good thing. Anyway, I know it's very very early in MW development, it was just an example.
Are you the dev of the cuckoo cycle?
@_date: 2017-02-10 17:52:25
But my point was about always having a small delay (being 1 block late), not a whole day. What I meant, but maybe this is where I'm wrong, was that almost everyone would catch-up block by block while the really powerful nodes actually process the next transactions in real-time. I don't understand what's bad with this.
@_date: 2017-02-11 12:48:57
I don't get why this seems so hard to understand to so many people. In this world there are anarchists, communists, socialists, centrists, democrats, republicans, liberals, conservatives, nationalists, all with various philosophies, and some religious, some agnostics, some atheists.
How do you get all these people on board of the same train?
You try to make the best out of all those ideologies by letting democracy choose the path. Nobody says it's the "best" path, it's only the worst form of government, except for all the others.
@_date: 2017-02-11 13:12:03
Agreed, which is why communication is important, and it's been lacking in the Bitcoin sphere. For example, I believe there would be much less fighting if there was an effort made to explain the developments intuitively (ELI5).
MimbleWimble, for instance, is incrediby complicated technology and I don't see much articles attempting to explain how it works. Do people know that the current path that grin is taking (the leading MW implementation) is of having fixed reward (fees are burnt)? I'm not saying it's wrong, just that it deserves discussion that nobody's having.

Nobody gives a fuck about censorship-resistance, privacy or money-sovereignty, except the few fanatics roaming this sub. The vast majority of people (understand: in the real world) care about instant, secure and intuitive transactions.
And for the millionth time, and I am really sick that this doesn't get in people's minds: Bitcoin's key argument is being a public API for money. Everything else is bonus. Decentralization is much less important than user growth. Because without users, the most decentralized network in the world is just useless.
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:46:08


To some degree, yes. My point is that the rush for decentralization over everything else is so costly to the users that it won't matter how permissionless Bitcoin is, because nobody will use it.


Wrong. It depends on the risk you allow yourself to take. 1 confirmation? 6 confirmations? 20? 0-conf with risk management? -&gt; Now we're talking instant, and it's always been the case.

YES, having a vision for Bitcoin and fighting for it is great! The problem is that politics are supposed to be about taking a direction that, while not everybody agrees to it, at least gives a path. But Bitcoin is in complete, utter deadlock. There is no way any path can be taken because each side tries to force it onto the other and there is no mechanism to solve the situation.
A lot of people in this sub have told me that Bitcoin should not be a democracy but a technocracy. That is exactly the reason of the state of Bitcoin right now. Because you believe in a technocracy rather than a democracy, we have come to this shitty, unsolvable place.
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:58:35
I don't think so. Sorry I answered to your other post below again, see Circle of government interference with technology.
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:03:06
But I don't agree with that roadmap because it is too costly.
You don't prepare for regulators, you wait for them to come and then adapt the software. If you prepare too early you put a very high cost onto the network which is just useless.

Core is essentially a rebranding of the first implementation of Bitcoin.
Call those rules "bitcoin-qt consensus rules" if you want, the reasoning is still the same.
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:03:00
You make very interesting points.
I would go farther about the "trust layer" and the "use layer". There could be any number of layers, each with their cost. Obviously, the more "trusty" the layer, the more expensive it is to use it.
The problem is that right now we have to pay 1$ to make a transaction in exchange for extremely good privacy and security. But in most cases (I would argue in the vast majority of cases), this amount of security is barely needed.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:41:49
Those consensus rules have been defined by Core. They are not Bitcoin consensus rules per se, they are Bitcoin **Core** consensus rules.
Because Bitcoin Core currently has the longest valid chain, its consensus rules are de facto Bitcoin consensus rules.

@_date: 2017-03-22 13:42:55
It allows easy app integration because it is permissionless and the API is public, contrarily to PayPal, Visa etc.
Think about indie or triple-A video games who would like to integrate in-game payments (which hasn't happened much with Bitcoin unfortunately), consider machines/robots paying each other etc.
The point is, with the standard that Bitcoin is, it will become easier and easier to just build and then reuse "Bitcoin payment plugins" that you just plug to your app and bam you have payments enabled. You don't need anyone's approval, and it's standard and easy.

So this is pure speculation at the moment. Nobody has any idea who the economic majority is.


Good point about cause and effect backwards. Still, without knowing in advance where the market will go, miners do their best guess at it, so it's kinda like a prediction market. And I believe it is the best metrics we have (not ideal, but the best).

Fair enough, how do you measure them?


At least we agree on something, the economic majority defines what is bitcoin. The problem is that you don't understand a fundamental property of cryptocurrencies: mining profitability is proportional to the market cap.
* Market cap of ETC vs ETH: 124M vs 1,706M. Or 7.3%
* Hashrate of ETC vs ETH: 861GH vs 11.76PH. Or 7.3%
I just took the last numbers on coinmarketcap.com and 
Do you see a link? Or is this just a coincidence to you?
Economic majority **is very closely** related to hashrate.
@_date: 2017-01-22 18:06:34


I hope you get my point... Forking a software utility repo isn't the same as forking a blockchain carrying $15 billion in value.
You are probably underestimating the indirect market of FFmpeg. Thousands of companies in the world use it. I know that updating the version of FFmpeg costs thousands to companies. I know because I do it. Multiply that by the number of companies and you get a pretty big number, probably in the billions of $ per year.
The market is simply more obvious in Bitcoin because of its nature.


I mostly agree, but I think the politics would be reduced if Core could improve its communication. Also, it gets a lot of hate because of it's a soft-fork. Anyway, this debate has been discussed at length so many times it's boring now.


Yes it's a blocksize increase. That's not what opponents attack. It's the fact that it's not atomic. Like commits, BIPs should be atomic IMHO.
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:07:47




You already said that, and I answered why that's not completely true. **A bit of decentralization** gives you permissionless. You don't need **a lot** of decentralization.


Any company can accept losses in exchange for instant transactions.
@_date: 2017-01-04 15:27:36
Like so many people here you don't get Bitcoin, do you?
One of the best characteristic of Bitcoin is that you don't have to trust a third party if you like to be in control, but you also *can* trust someone if you find it simpler. There's no shame in that, it's just much much easier. There is a risk that they get hacked, or lose the money or go away with it, but this risk may be better for people who tend to forget to do backups... 
@_date: 2017-01-22 13:36:36


Yes it is. It's a protocol. A protocol is even more constrained than an API because its primitives should be called in order. I mean, Bitcoin Core is shipped with a lib. It's called libbitcoinconsensus.


No, they do not validate new rules. And assuming you are right that Satoshi intended for soft-forks to be the sole way of upgrading, I'd like to see a source for that assumption.


Only those who want to update will. There's no cheating involved. If you don't like the new rules, stay on your old chain.
Etc etc. There is so much wrong in your post I could write for hours.
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:53:14
You vastly overestimate how much people care for their own freedom. I'm not saying it's a good thing, I'm just saying it's in our nature. Which is why Bitcoin is so great: people who actually care about trustlessness have an option now! But for the other vast majority, well it's a good thing that there are online wallets because otherwise nobody would use Bitcoin.
And it's not only about wallets. I can guarantee that when a fast, centralized off-chain solution for sending txs will come out, &gt; 99% of people will use it. It will piss off everybody who cares about decentralization and money sovereignty, but it will be the obvious truth.
@_date: 2017-01-22 17:55:29
Yes I know that's what I was saying.
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:49:08


Yes. Security will increase as time passes. It's not a binary state where transactions are either insecure or secure. It's just lower security for some time, until things even out.
Your comment suggests the same thing we have been criticizing Core for years: you don't understand that risk is manageable. That's the same reason that makes unconfirmed transactions insecure in theory, but very reliable in practice. When you're a company, this is a risk you may be willing to take.
@_date: 2017-01-04 16:52:02

@_date: 2017-01-22 23:45:33


I hadn't really thought of that. This is so far the best argument against hard-forks I've read yet. Still, there are two things to note about this:
* Nodes that don't work anymore don't screw people so much. They don't lose money, they just can't send or receive. Am I right? Anyway, I'll admit it's not a neat solution.
* "I don't have to update in order for it to continue working": that's not always true. For example, if you're still using an old version of FFmpeg, you'll never be able to read H265 files. Now, because the external world evolves, maybe your program will receive these H265 files now and won't be able to decode those. So it effectively won't be working anymore. It's the same here: those old nodes will receive transactions they just don't understand, which makes them continue to work but... they will be oblivious to the external world.
You made some pretty sound arguments, I'm gonna think about this a bit more.


Having a brash style or being busy on code and IRC is not an issue imo. It's just that few people take the time to build an intuitive summary of the major BIPs, with diagrams etc. I think the little cost of doing this, while avoiding some major misunderstandings in both camps, would be quite productive. And unfortunately I do think it's the role of devs to do that. In most companies, when you build some big feature, you may have to give a presentation about it. And they better be simple, because those watching could be from the HR department etc.


I'm not sure I got this part. I don't see why BIPs shouldn't be atomic?
@_date: 2017-01-21 16:48:41
What exactly makes you believe status quo should bypass vote? Status quo is an option like any other. If I follow your train of thought correctly, the software should never change if only 90% of people vote for new features every time?

You haven't given me a single fact. You can't be disproven because you're making empty statements.


In practice, that's how every change of rules in Bitcoin has been added as of now (except for accidental hard-forks in the beginning). 


That seems to be the end of your non-argumentation. I suppose we're done here.
@_date: 2017-01-21 09:49:30
For the love of god, what is it with the fear of hard forks on this side?
Every library that I know of break their API from time to time. That's how you make a cleaner code, that's how you can stop supporting obsolete apps. FFmpeg makes a major, API-breaking version every quarter.
Soft-forks are terrible in that they make people believe they are fully validating when they are only partially validating. That's just a dirty cheat.
Everybody around here always says "Don't push for controversial changes". Segwit IS controversial. I wouldn't dare to estimate the number of opponents, but it's sufficiently big to make me believe it will never pass.
So, if Core has pushed a major controversial change into its software, why hasn't it done the same with a simple blocksize increase? What makes devs think Segwit would be less controversial than a +1MB increase?

You can't force everyone to reach a consensus all the time. That has to be the most stupid idea I've ever heard. Splitting the network lets the opposing philosophies have a more natural, market-oriented fight.
Everyone says ETH vs ETC was a failure. In what universe was that a failure? They are now both functioning cryptocurrencies with a different ideal, and they both have a non-negligible market cap, meaning people are invested for success in both camps.

I don't see where I'm disagreeing with anything I've been saying here. I'm just stating the fact that price is probably somehow linked to Metcalfe's law, but it's harder to make the connection because there are a lot of factors involved. The utility of the network being one of them.

Speaking from personal experience, I only know of a single person who uses Bitcoin regularly, and it is to buy drugs... I don't understand what Bitcoin use case is for you.

I'll just say: think of what the world would be without Windows. And no, the answer is not "Linux would have thrived".
About Linus view of open source:  and 


It's superior because it's a lot more fun and because it makes cooperation much easier (no silly NDA's or artificial barriers to innovation like in a proprietary setting), and I think Open Source is the right thing to do the same way I believe science is better than alchemy. Like science, Open Source allows people to build on a solid base of previous knowledge, without some silly hiding.
But I don't think you need to think that alchemy is "evil." It's just pointless because you can obviously never do as well in a closed environment as you can with open scientific methods.

And I'm assuming the contrary, that I'm the perfect target audience for "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System". I'm an engineer, and the idea that it's permissionless scriptable money is why I'm so excited about it.
Every use case you said: "buy drugs, donate to Wikileaks, escape capital control, hedge against economy, and international money transfer" are just that: use cases among so many others. Why you prioritize them before others baffles me. You think you're taking the moral high ground because you're allowing people who usually can't use money the way we can. That's a shitty way to view Bitcoin, because it should always be *apolitical*. It should not be a leftist currency, nor a rightist currency, nor fascist nor anarchist nor anything.
@_date: 2016-12-15 15:33:57
I've always thought this philosophy is a big bunch of bullshit.
I don't believe in open source because it frees individuals. I believe in open source because it is sometimes (often) better than proprietary solutions.
What matters at the end of the day is which software is the most powerful. Bringing ideology into software has always seemed like a terrible idea.
In that sense, I feel much closer to Torvalds than Stallman. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 09:29:53
Yes it does, or at least the utility part. The price part is subject to a lot of speculation/manipulation so it would be difficult to link it to Metcalfe's law.


It's exactly the same with Bitcoin. Each time a new user enters the network, it creates a virtual link between this new person and every other participant in the network, thus making the growth in utility of the network proportional to the number of *current* participants. It's so simple I don't know what is bothering you.
@_date: 2016-12-07 16:52:17
There are other metrics:
* I've seen more big companies dropping Bitcoin in 2016 than welcoming it.
* The UX has been getting worse, with transactions getting lost in a kind of Schrödinger state: they are both spent and unspent until they get into a block or are never included because other transactions always have a better fee.
* Emergent use cases are being forced to 2nd layer solutions, which basically means dumped because these layers don't exist yet.
* More generally, I haven't seen a compelling use case except for drugs (which I don't do, so I don't care).
@_date: 2016-12-07 19:09:38
For a nascent technology, to be adopted and then rejected by a big company is a big fat red flag. Maybe not a show stopper, but a massive failure.
Censorship resistant is a nice side effect, it is NOT a use case, nor is it some priority number one property. The priority number one property of bitcoin is the API.

That's just plainly wrong. You just have to show me the "many" implementations to prove you're right, though.

@_date: 2016-11-24 20:01:56


A team hard forked (ETC) to take a different route than what Vitalik was suggesting. To me -- and I know many people disagree, even in r/btc -- that split was a huge progress, because it showed that the market is what eventually defines the future of a cryptocurrency. *That* is what various implementations should strive for. Defining a new path (new consensus rules after a supermajority), and the market chooses which path it wants to take.


XT, Classic and BU can barely be spoken about here. I'll admit I didn't know about picocoin and bits of proof, for the rest I'm sorry but their influence is so not enough. See my previous paragraph.


There is a single philosophy in Bitcoin right now, which shows a lack of maturity. You can't have everybody agree all the time, can you? Let's reverse the roles for the sake of the argument. Let's assume BU is the most used Bitcoin implementation, and they intend to raise the blocksize to 2MB. Now Core rebels arrive to try to change that because they believe 1MB is better. How do you intend to make your case as a software? Do you try to reach a 95% consensus or do you just let them have their 2MB blocks even though they may have only 20%, or 40% or 60% of consensus behind them?

Sorry if I wasn't clear, I was talking about high level design decisions. I have no doubt Segwit is very well tested. But if you don't let other use cases breathe you purposefully limit Bitcoin's functional perimeter.


I disagree. People tend to overthink these characteristics that carry a huge technical burden because they think the project is doomed once one of these properties is attacked. I don't believe that is true, because reaction to attack in networks is generally much faster than what we imagine (e.g. BU's crash disaster which was very quickly fixed by node operators recompiling ad restarting the software).

Segwit requires tremendous changes to current software at most companies. Something that your side never acknowledged, and which is proved by the ridiculous amount of segwit txs (~2%) after weeks of existence.
They will get there eventually, but if there are hypocrites here, it's the Core side, not these companies that have to implement this clusterfuck.

The decentralisation BU proponents want is obviously not about having different consensus rules at the same time, please stop being condescending.
It's about offering a democratic process as to what the *future* consensus rules will be, for everybody. From this perspective, Core right now is the sole decider for new consensus rules. That's a single-party system, and it's terrible for progress.
@_date: 2016-10-18 12:18:04
No, decentralised means the database and the computation are split across a large number of nodes on the network. The fact that everyone does everything (storing the whole DB and computing every tx) is only necessary because of the current design of Bitcoin.
Many P2P networks have successfully implemented Distributed Hash Tables. It might be much more difficult (or even impossible) with Bitcoin(s current design, but in any case it shows a flaw in the protocol.

* b) "Would this technology generate transaction fees for us?". Fees are just kinds of very small block rewards, so it's even less reward that way.

It's exactly the same thing as the mainnet with a few small differences: 
* Default Bitcoin network protocol listen port is 18333 (instead of 8333)
* Default RPC connection port is 18332 (instead of 8332)
* Bootstrapping uses different DNS seeds.
* A different value of ADDRESSVERSION field ensures no testnet Bitcoin addresses will work on the production network. (0x6F rather than 0x00)
* The protocol message header bytes are 0x0B110907 (instead of 0xF9BEB4D9)
* Minimum difficulty of 1.0 on testnet is equal to difficulty of 0.5 on mainnet. This means that the mainnet-equivalent of any testnet difficulty is half the testnet difficulty. In addition, if no block has been found in 20 minutes, the difficulty automatically resets back to the minimum for a single block, after which it returns to its previous value.
* A new genesis block
* The IsStandard() check is disabled so that non-standard transactions can be experimented with.
This is from  I'm not 100% sure it's up to date but I think it is.

Why would miners be incentivized to merge-mine unless a sidechain has a significant portion of the money supply?
The reward for finding a block on the sidechain will probably be a fraction of the number of bitcoins imported. That sounds like the only way to be fair to those who "import" bitcoins into a sidechain. Otherwise their sidecoins would quickly decrease in value as miners share a bigger portion of the sidechain's money supply.
On Bitcoin's main chain, there are ~15M bitcoins, and a reward of 25 bitcoins per block. That's a 0.00016666666% inflation rate right now.
Assuming the same inflation rate on a sidechain and 10min blocks, and importing 100,000 bitcoins into that sidechain, merge-mining that sidechain would give a reward of 0.17 bitcoins...

Code is trivial to fork, communities are not.
Think about Bitcoin as a country: there are thousands of people living there, some of them see the future a certain way, some of them see the future another way, the others don't care.
What you're saying is basically: if you don't like what we're doing, then by all means go away. It is so not that simple. Rebuilding something else is a *whole freaking lot of work*, because there is very strong inertia in communities.
What I'm saying is: we have to keep this country going, and the majority should have their way. It's the way almost every civilized country runs today.

The advantage is quite obvious to me. Right now, let's say you have a torrent software that wants to enable Bitcoin (like Joystream), and then a Dropbox-like app, and OpenBazaar. All of these have to implement their own wallets. They should be able to communicate through an API to the kernel. Yes I'm aware that would be a lot of work, but the flexibility that comes with it would be game-changing. Suppose you're an app developer, you don't have to reinvent the Bitcoin wheel for the 1000th time.

There is the problem I think. You say that a UASF may be successful once it gets important economic nodes. That's not enough. It needs miner majority, the higher the best, and even with, say, 80% of miners (at the moment of activation), the risk of a long-term split is high IMO.
@_date: 2017-05-18 17:56:11


Yes, this is fundamental. bitcoin.org has done a great job at explaining how to run a full node, and the documentation is absolutely amazing. If the same thing could be made for bips (less technicalities, more diagrams and shit) on bitcoin.org, it would kill a lot of myths indeed.

As you said, "UASF requires support by economically significant actors, like exchanges, payment processors, etc. "
This support is **gameable**. There is nothing to actually measure it. Only the hashrate is an objective measure.
This was fine for a time, when Bitcoin was not too big and those features and bug fixes had unilateral consensus. We knew the hashrate would follow.
That's basically why you say Bitcoin itself is a kind of UASF at its inception. True, you can do anything when you don't have users, miners, exchanges etc.
Right now it's different. Bitcoin is big. Segwit is controversial, even amongst exchanges, which means that a UASF is likely to split the chain. So this is very different than the context you talked about.
And finally, this split risk is very close to a hard-fork, not in theory but in practice.

Bitcoin, before anything else, needs to be permissionless. That is to me, by far, the most important thing. Core's monopoly over Bitcoin is extremely worrying.
So if BU succeeds, let's go as far as suggesting they have &gt;50% hash power, that means the market has decided it is a better solution. Whether you like it or not. If you consider that the market choice going against yours is the destruction of Bitcoin, then I am sorry to tell you you don't get why Bitcoin is amazing.
Bitcoin is amazing because it is the first relatively successful public protocol for money. It needs to be forkable so that users choose their favorite features, otherwise it is just another centralized currency in the hands of a tiny group.

Ok, you are exactly the kind of person I want to get insight from, because I am at a loss of words with this 95% thing. How anyone can possibly think this is a good idea is beyond me. 
I'm gonna try to explain why, please tell me why you feel I might be wrong.
Every single political system that is not a dictatorship in the world is composed of several parties, or at the very least two: the traditional left and right. Why? Because people have various ideologies which are often objectively debatable but which are a trade-off on economic, social, ecological etc. levels. Politics allow nations to be shaped despite these differences. My point is, you won't convince everyone that abortion is good, that capitalism is good, that weapons are good, and you certainly won't convince 95% of the people to any of those points. But democracy enters the game, and you implement something, that might not be awesome for everyone, but at least the country goes somewhere. 
Why is this relevant to Bitcoin? Because some parts of Bitcoin **are** an ideological trade-off. The block size is one of those. It is a trade-off between scaling and decentralization. These are not subject to a technical debate, there is no technical truth to it, you just place yourself on that imaginary trade-off line and are as technically right as everybody else. The only thing that makes you different than someone else on this line is ideology. 
So assuming you agree with me on these points, there are 2 possibilities :
* You believe it is always possible to eventually reach a 95% consensus on a solution, although it would be very easy for any entity worth &gt;5% hashrate to veto any changes to the protocol. From an ideological standpoint, that last part is the most likely, and is actually happening right now. 
* You believe that Bitcoin may stall forever and you are fine with it. 
In any case, I find both these ideas very wrong and extremely dangerous for the health of the Bitcoin network. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 17:58:53

@_date: 2017-07-12 17:49:50
Of course. In that case this is just a divorce for the best I guess. I totally acknowledge that there is a massive ideology disagreement between both parties and that it will eventually be solved by a split. In that case, I just hope that the players are fair and consider Bitcoin, the "original brand" , the chain that has the most economic activity. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 22:21:39


It's too easy to blame full blocks on spam. Yes, it exists, yes, it might be consequential, but natural, actual user growth is **there**, you just look at the charts. Both grow proportionally, and you just have to account for it. Which is why you shouldn't make them easier by limiting the blocksize. 


Nobody is pushing anything. There are markets listed on some websites, and everybody can check their health by looking at market cap, volume and so on. 
About ICOs, I don't have a strong opinion, but I still believe they're what makes eth great : individually, they're a drop in the ocean, together they make a huge network of applications that remind me of the early internet. 


Ironically, I think you are the ones making it fragile by wanting to preserve its decentralization properties too much. This might seem paradoxical, but by making Bitcoin bigger and caring less about the centralization aspects, it would become more resilient, through the well-known "too big to fail" property.
There is a tendency to fix things that are too centralized very fast on the internet : we saw it with torrents. At the beginning, there were a few centralized apps like Napster. When it got attacked, emule emerged with a centralized team but a decentralized network. It got attacked too, which led to very decentralized websites (like thepiratebay multiple mirrors) with decentralized network. 
My point is, there is no need for urgency. Decentralization has a cost, that should only be used when it gets attacked. Because while you let it breathe, it will grow so much that powerful entities will actually care about it and won't let such attacks happen. 
Or at least that is how I view things. I have to admit I am really sick to see this experiment become the grail of anarchists, when it could have become a worldwide currency, 
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:19:02


Again, that is not true. Miners play as much of a role as nodes in a PoW system. If you don't get that, I can't do anything for you. 


No. The point was that UASF forced a compromise to be found, which **happens** to be segwit + 2x. Do you consider that UASF enabled 2x? If you don't, that means UASF didn't activate segwit either. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 17:25:51
That's very insightful, l'll read the bip and code in details. The UASF as economic pressure, I had no idea about. I don't think most people running it want it to be a simple poke to the miners though.

@_date: 2017-07-28 10:49:19
I believe I know how Bitcoin works fine.
The part where you're wrong is this one: "The miners accelerated the adoption of segwit simply because of the threat of the uasf nodes."
Due to the horrible soft-fork that is UASF, the original chain was at risk of reorganization, putting users at risk. Miners did the sensible thing and adopted a plan to counterattack UASF and protect the users.

When it starts hurting others (financially or else), yes. 


But those essential principles are your ideology, they do not represent the project. I simply believe that decentralization has a high cost, both financially and technically (the more decentralized, the more inefficient). But of course some decentralization is required since Bitcoin is essentially a P2P money issuer. The question is how much is good enough?


Nothing in that sentence makes sense. Spam doesn't exist on the blockchain. There are only valid or invalid transactions.


Ideally yes, but the human species loves things that just work without their intervention. Forking is easy, getting a community is hard (even if a majority agrees with you).

Well here are my thoughts. They may not include everything that is happening but they're my idea of what's going to happen in 3 months.
The NYA agreement has been followed by most companies and miners because it would move Bitcoin forward and make everyone happy (and unhappy, like every compromise).
But this agreement has been working because all parties would get what they asked and signed for. In some minds (like jgarzik's), the 2x part will not fail because it has overwhelming support.
I believe that's completely delusional, and a split will happen again in november, with the 2x part being redundant with Bitcoin Cash that better answers the requests of big blockers.
I think at that point the segwit2x branch will be less appreciated than BCC, and 2x people will migrate to BCC.

And I think users have been very patient with Core considering that they've been stalling Bitcoin for 3 years. -&gt; That is extremist.

Indeed, the UI is gorgeous! It has that DeviantArt feel but actually more minimalistic which is better imo.
Really cool to see the progress made, I wish you the best.
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:51:49
Let me ask you a question: when fees go back to the critical point they were in a few months ago (&gt;3$ per tx) in the segwit-minus-2x chain, what is going to happen? 
@_date: 2017-07-28 10:29:10


That's just wrong on so many levels.
@_date: 2017-07-28 09:27:57
No, SW2X is what convinced miners to support SW, **because** UASF put every user at risk at that moment.
@_date: 2017-07-05 22:24:58
How so?
Inaction has made the fees go up so high that it's provoked an exodus of users to altcoins.
We have a proof that inaction **has made people lose money** right here, right now. Whereas moving forward with a fork hasn't been proven to provoke the same results.
@_date: 2017-07-28 09:29:01
No, because it's not a soft-fork. We don't force anyone to follow us. Which is why I made this comment: for something that is completely opt-in, you guys sure seem to be quite angry. Are you sure you don't wanna keep some just in case it takes off? :)
@_date: 2017-07-03 15:08:01
/s? Really?
Nothing is happening guys, this chart must be lying: 
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:49:56
But even assuming there is actually a whale spamming the network insidiously, 
* there still was a huge exodus as shown by Bitcoin's dominance index
* this doesn't inspire confidence in the network at all, because it means it's really fucking easy to torture Bitcoin, something that was made possible by quasi-full blocks. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:07:10


How so? Enlighten me, please. I haven't said a single wrong thing in this discussion.


It forced decent developers (btc1) to find a solution that would content everybody, while Core was watching Bitcoin fall apart without moving a finger. So yes, in a twisted mind, it did enable Segwit.
@_date: 2015-11-13 12:15:35
No, and it's sad that people can't see the bigger picture. Decentralization is a nice bonus (an important one, and we should preferably work towards that direction). But the thing that is even more interesting is the protocol. For the first time, we have a *public API for money*, this means we can program money.
That is the best thing Bitcoin has going for it.
@_date: 2017-05-18 13:22:09
I just like to piss off extremists.
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:50:47
You're in denial. 
There is a limit where most users aren't willing to pay more. I've wondered where that limit was for some time, but Bitcoin's full blocks have eventually shown it: users are not willing to pay &gt;~5$.
This is the critical point where people look for other solutions. It was shown by the recent exodus to eth and other altcoins. When Bitcoin reaches that point again, its market will bleed into altcoins. 
If you think I'm wrong, then I can understand why you would believe segwit is enough. Real users won't care though, they will naturally select a winner. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:35:59
They probably all have their own modified version anyway, that doesn't mean much. What's important is the idea they're supporting. And it's segwit2x. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 10:32:06
I respect that you have an ideal of peace, but that is not how the world works.
The "live-together" utopia has been damaging Bitcoin for years now, so much so that it went below 50% of dominance.
The split will allow natural selection to be the decider, not intelligent design.
@_date: 2017-07-12 11:19:51
But that would be a premined altcoin. Isn't that a bad thing?
@_date: 2017-07-28 09:49:39
You got segwit because of btc1 miners, not UASF miners.
Which means Core devs have nothing to do with this. Nor UASF devs (althouh they're just disguised Core devs...)
@_date: 2015-02-18 15:13:19
No doubt, but Bitcoin has to be explained very carefully, otherwise even very clever students would raise an eyebrow. It's good to remember that at first, very few people believed Satoshi, even among arguably extremely smart people.
@_date: 2017-07-28 09:32:18


That is wrong. UASF is what forced devs and miners to find a compromise, and segwit2x emerged. Without it, UASF would have activated with no economic activity and become a liability for the whole ecosystem. Which is why Bitmain proposed to UAHF just in case this happened.
@_date: 2016-05-13 07:09:03
Hey, just wanted to say thanks for trying to be constructive against Core devs policies.
The "autism" (as in lack of emotional intelligence, not literally) of these people is insane. This major Bitcoin subreddit, supported by most Core devs, is explicitly telling its users to fuck off. This is so wrong on so many levels, I can't even begin to understand what their plan is.
If you're running an open-source community, you should be the bigger person. There will always be entitled assholes, ignore them. But the constructive criticism should always be welcome, and **this hasn't been the case at all here**.
Any plan adverse to Core is considered a "coup" as stated, and this is not how progress is made. Innovation is the competition of ideas.
@_date: 2017-05-07 20:48:56
I would love to, but I've already put my money where my mouth is. I guess it's time to say : "may the best crypto win." :) 
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:52:59
Well we disagree on the fundamentals, but at least we're smart enough to acknowledge that this split was necessary. If everybody was thinking like this, maybe this wouldn't have happened to start with... 
@_date: 2015-10-27 09:25:52
Out of curiosity, why was python chosen for the backend?
@_date: 2017-07-28 07:09:18
For a bunch of guys who have always told us to fork off, you sure seem to be obsessed with Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:16:58
Hashrate will follow price.
@_date: 2015-02-18 00:35:06
I kind of agree with da_unique. He went very fast to the sudoku solving metaphor although he didn't explain why it was needed. If you don't know how bitcoin works, hearing that to solve the decentralized consensus problem you need to compute useless games may be far from intuitive.
But as Wvspecialkvw pointed the students seemed to know what he was talking about so it probably went well.
@_date: 2017-07-24 11:47:09
What makes you think it's not happening?
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:05:18
Would you sell them to me at $1? I will gladly take it. :)
@_date: 2017-07-28 09:48:25
I agree, but the NYA agreement has *massive* support from miners and economic nodes. I don't know about users. Which means that if it is broken (and I believe like you that it's likely), there will be a big exodus to BCC.
@_date: 2017-06-01 13:03:40


By all the metrics I know of there are more than 5% of people who don't want SegWit. Nodes, bitfinex futures, community engagement (reddit), signed votes on bitcoin.com...


Huh? You're kidding, right? Please tell me you're kidding.


Yes, I agree. Which is why even though I don't particularly like SegWit, I would be ok having it as long as the majority wants it. That's democracy, you have to accept what the biggest number wants.
@_date: 2017-06-01 15:52:56
True, democracy means there is always a possibility of tyranny of the majority. But it's better than tyranny of the minority, which is every single other form of government.
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:50:01
Do you really believe SegWit would have activated with GPU miners? It requires 95% hashrate. Let's assume users were all mining. There is much more than 5% of users who don't want SegWit.
@_date: 2013-12-01 13:58:44
I'm not sure you're using the right metrics. If we use the population as the proportional factor (that's about 300M in USA and 70M in France), we get that 500 places for 300M people would be more than 100 cool-french-accepting-bitcoins stores, for our 70M inhabitants.
