I'm from r/CaveStory, and I'd rather you don't destroy our art.
@_date: 2017-04-02 20:54:27
Also, please tell the rest of the people to stop attacking our stuff, okay? It's still getting attacked?

Hello from r/CaveStory ! We would like to make a bit of a peace treaty with you all! As you can probably see, we are making some pixel art to your left. We have one character done (Quote), and are building a second (Curly). However it seems that you are going to build another logo, and it may overlap with Curly.
I am just asking if you may consider not taking us over. Please consider the offer.

Could I perhaps interest you into expanding in another direction? Perhaps downwards, or at the very least just let us keep her. We will not be building anything to the right besides Curly.

I would, but we need to use orange in our sprite. Could we use blue for filling, and then surround it with orange?

I noticed that, I joined your discord to discuss this. I hope this works out!

Can you guys PLEASE stop attacking us over at r/CaveStory? We're just trying to set up a border and you guys keep attacking us.

The few of us over at r/CaveStory would really appreciate you guy moving your project somewhere else. We're such a small sub that it took us half the day just to get Curly there. 
We promise not to build towards the right after we finish Curly, we will just build down and left.

Alright, thanks!

I remember that, technically, you guys tried to build over us first. The Segwit started going over Curly (the blonde girl). No hard feelings though.
I don't think I can stop our subreddit now though. Do you think you can let us finish the project? We wont build into you anymore.
This is what we're trying to do (we had to give up the flying toaster, so just ignore that)
