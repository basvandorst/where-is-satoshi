They wanna kick us Muslims out? I say let's kick EU out to another planet. They did this with the website cookie nonsense before too. They can't just decide stuff in court with no knowledge of what the heck a web browser is.

See, this is why I love the r/Bitcoin community XD

Waiting for someone to jump in and say they'll eat their right ball if that happens...

Hmmm... Well, for the individual, you are not tracked, or your transactions aren't at least as far as I understand, but the refund stuff can't be done easily. The sellers can abuse this as pointed out earlier. Not something bitcoin can deal with in the future as they will lose their key function. Thanks for the reply!

I see. Thanks for the answer.

Exiting the system you are supposed to follow, stopping to be robotized, protesting against that, I think I understand. 
@_date: 2016-09-26 13:35:55
So, you are saying bitcoin is good since it's not a system currency. Interesting. 
@_date: 2016-09-26 13:35:05
Awesome, I think I got it. Investments on bitcoin are safer, and fees are less. The consumer protections aren't their thing, but I now understand why they shouldn't be with BC. Thanks for the answer!

In which cases or situations would I have to use Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-09-27 00:53:21
Meanwhile Google has no idea...
@_date: 2016-09-26 16:10:52
I understand now more about the genre of bitcoin and why you'd want to keep your transactions private. I doubt it's ideal for the regular consumer, who wouldn't be going more than buying things on eBay, I assume. It is surely a complex system...
