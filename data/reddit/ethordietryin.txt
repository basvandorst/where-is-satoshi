I’ve used bitcoin for both porn and drugs, so it’s a couple uses for it. Also investment, speculation, and any other goods/services available to buy on the web and pay in bitcoin. Lol

You are saying because bitcoin has 100x before, that if it 50x now, it would not be surprising. Wow. If everyone thinks like this then I need to start shorting. Were you not surprised by the first couple 100x? Or because it happen so regularly now you extrapolate what may or may not happen

Well put, I am bearish on bitcoin as well. Love the part near the end, if people don’t care about bitcoin it doesn’t matter if it’s scarce. Everyone shilling it and predicting 50-100k, only makes it look crazier. You put it better than I could

Choose a side. Every transaction is viewable on the blockchain. All it takes is a little searching. Moving btc around a couple wallets if you buy it on a verified exchange is easy to track, only way to have anon btc is to use mixers and create a completely new wallet not connected to any known wallets with your identity

There will always be competition for currency, just as the USD and Chinese Yaun are held by most countries as reserve currency. It can change sure, say we move it all to blockchain, bitcoin and stable coins, who knows what else could come up in the next 20 years..

You said it better than me, markets are prediction mechanisms. You predict 6x+, I think bitcoin won’t go to 50k. We all make predictions. You just hope enough other moon bois see you’re side, and I hope rational people see my side. But markets are irrational and illiquid and have manipulation so you never know

If you’re typing this on a computer or phone, it can be tracked unless you literally use a VPN 100% the time.

Please explain what valuation model you use to project 50k. Past history is not indicative of future results. 50k from 7.5k now, talk about unrealistic expectations haha and why everyone is disappointed when it doesn’t go up

Lol they have to answer to someone, they aren’t just a rouge company, as much as we all dislike them, BitPay is one of the biggest companies in crypto

I know we all big on decentralization, but as a company BitPay still has Know Your Customer KYC rules and has to follow regulations. BitPay being a Visa card also, Visa may require further info. Shit sucks lol
