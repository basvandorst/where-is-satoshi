Download Bitcoin full node onto a different computer. Once the sinking is complete try to access the old computer and copy the wallet.dat file to a USB drive. Then you take that file and put it on the new computer overwriting the old wallet.dat file. If you have any success I accept donations in the form of brand new Honda Accords. LOL

From 2008 to 2018 the US dollar has been inflated 16.2%
Probably not a big deal if you're living paycheck-to-paycheck but if you have thousands of dollars it would kind of suck knowing that it loses value every year you are saving it unless you have some sort of savings account that pays more than 2% interest a year. 
Gradually people are going to start moving their money over from Bank to Bitcoin.
I really don't think the analyst or experts know anything other than this is the money of the future and come up with a realistic number for hopeful holders to believe in. My personal experience it could go up 65% tomorrow if you go down 65% tomorrow but it's definitely going to be around and it's not going away anytime soon.

I put my life savings in crypto and I've kept it there for over 2 years I guess I'm an idiot. I also bought some gold and silver coins cuz I like things that jingle.
You must be a strong believer in the US Dollar even though it has been inflated 16.2% over the last 120 months. If you're in the bottom 60% than inflation is great because it reduces the actual value of debt unless that debt has interest then it's even worse then no inflation at all.
Inflation is an invisible tax that doesn't help anyone except the people printing the money up.
Inflation dates all the way back to ancient Rome when they were drilling holes in their gold coins and they were using that drilled out gold to make more coins.

I know if you don't complete kyc or AML you will not be able to move Fiat purchased crypto off of an exchange.
If someone is level 3 verified the only thing suspicious I think they could do is running some sort of side business and making multiple daily deposits on to the same Exchange. If you received your coins from some dark web marketplace powerseller that is going to bite you in the ass.
Once you have your coins the best thing you can do is either hold them or use them for purchasing things. Sending them back to an exchange to me is just stupid.

Plus most of my ex's have told me if I want it 3 or more times a day I need to find a hooker. I have noticed almost everyone is a hooker if you offer them enough up front. Accept ex's they'll just take the money and give you nothing.

I would recommend getting rid of the Gmail address and creating a protonmail email address. Download the free protonmail VPN, use the protonmail email address to create a new Google account. Every time you log into Google use the protonmail email address. Use DuckDuckGo instead of Google for all your searching. You can also search all your YouTube videos on DuckDuckGo and all the advertisements are removed. If you don't own any Android devices there is no reason to even have a Google account anymore. If you haven't already installed the brave web browser I recommend that as well. You get paid in basic attention token for browsing the web. You can get 0.3 bat about five times an hour.

The referral link actually doesn't do anything. They need the actual referral code and there's a spot where it can be plugged in on the main menu.
After they manually plug in the referral code they need to add a debit card right away and then send $5 to the person they received the referral code from.
Both parties will receive a $5 bonus from cash app after everything has been done in that order.
If you are a business owner this is an easy way of giving someone something of $5 in value away for free.
I personally don't think $5 is enough incentive to get someone to jump through all these hoops. They should be getting $10 worth of bitcoin free as well so they can actually see how Bitcoin works.

Bitpay slightly does. They give you an account number and routing number for direct deposits and I guess they charge $5 to withdraw funds using that same info so potentially you could pay off your credit card using a bitpay debit card.
The only free options is to use the card itself for purchases and or ask for cash back  when making purchases  as a pin number debit card purchase. The card also cost $10 if you lose it and need to replace it.

Most people keep their crypto in a custody wallet like coinbase Pro or cash app. It doesn't cost anything at all to send crypto out of one of those wallets. If you send it to a lightning Network wallet for daily spending, again you're not paying very much in fees.

If you live in the United States you can buy crypto using a debit card with cash app.
Checking account using coinbase.
Wire transfer using Bittrex &amp; Circle 
Binance is now accepting credit card purchases.
For cashing out you can get a bitpay visa debit card or buy giftcards at bitrefill or egifter.
And the most expensive option is using a Bitcoin ATM and they are located in just about every major city.

Transaction fees are what rewards miners for keeping the entire thing secure. If there are no fees, then they will just mine something else more profitable.
Would you feel more protected putting your life savings in a Prius that gets 40 miles per gallon or an Armored truck that gets 8 miles per gallon?  Its never going to be cheaper to transport the most secure vehicle.

Cash App is instant and you can use debit card for about the same price coinbase charges for ACH with checking account. From there you can send to coinbase pro right away but I recommend poloniex or bittrex over coinbase.

It helps reduce volatility of one's holdings. Plus if it was a stablecoin wallet on an exchange like coinbase you could easily transfer to the bank right away. The Bitcoin would be cold storage address. Most people don't have a house or car paid in full so you would need to take a portion of that sale to complete that loan.
If someone wanted to pay in full using Bitcoin I would never turn it down.

How is Bitcoin a terrible way to launder money? If you have $100,000 worth of drug money just buy Bitcoin with cash and then transfer it to your bank using an exchange. When you file taxes just say that you mined the coins then pay whatever taxes you owe and the money is now clean as a whistle.
Might want to still put the coins through a mixer just to avoid associating with whoever you got the coins from.

It was a therapist. I went to the police. They polygraphed him and he failed.
He told them I gave him permission.
I was out of town for my birthday and he broke into my house stole my precious metals. Only reason he got caught was cuz he took credit cards and I told the police to review the cameras of where the transactions took place. They showed me the person on surveillance and it was my fucking therapist.
I'm sure he was looking for my Bitcoins but was expecting some sort of physical coin or something .

Yes I know and the therapist knows that too.
 It doesn't help when he wants to renew his license with the state.
The only thing that helped me was proving I was telling the truth when the cops didn't know who was being truthful. They didn't even bother polygraphing me. They were satisfied with the results they had. He lied on every question. 
The only thing I could do is probably invite him on The Steve Wilkos show and publicly embarrass the shit out of him. Maybe Steve will throw a chair at him.

If exchanges start allowing lightning Network withdrawals then you don't need to worry about adjusting any block sizes. I run a Bitcoin full node on a 10mbps internet connection on a five year old computer. Why should I be forced to upgrade anything when everything works great the way it is? The more computers running full nodes the more secure the network gets. Changing the block size will reduce the amount of full nodes which keep the network protected. If you want something different than use one of the forked alternatives. Bitcoin works great just the way it is.
@_date: 2018-12-25 22:52:03

You could easily be scammed with gold unless you are purchasing from a legit source.
A fake gold coin can either have the right weight but it's not the right size. It can also have the right size but not be the right weight. 
You do not have to worry about Bitcoin being the right size or the right weight making it superior store of value.
The best way to purchase gold coins is to have gold coins to compare them with. They have a very distinctive sound when you drop them onto a hard surface. If it doesn't sound right it's probably fake.

I don't use hardware wallets.
I just create 12 words using Ian Coleman's bip39 tool on an offline air-gapped machine.
I store my coins there. I store the words somewhere safe.
If I want to access the funds I use Coinomi or Exodus. When I'm finished I create a new air gapped set of 12 words.
Obviously you don't have that level of privacy or security with physical gold or silver coins. If you have a physical hardware wallet you're pretty much letting the thief know if you have crypto.
As an additional security measure I mix my old 12 words with my new 12 words. they are all passphrase protected and I don't keep the passphrase written down.

I had 2 oz of gold 2 oz of silver and my crypto 12 words in the same fireproof box. A friend of mine broke into my house and stole my gold and silver they didn't steal my crypto. I have moved my crypto to a different set of 12 words and now I keep it stored somewhere much more secure and Out Of Reach.
I also keep my 12 words protected with a passphrase that is not included with the 12 words.
This is a perfect example of why crypto is better than precious metals. Those 12 words were worth way more than those 4 coins and they totally got ignored.
