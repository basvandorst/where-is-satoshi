Happy cakeday! I'm embarrassed that I don't know if that's the same as a birthday or not. But that counts as a basic question, right?

The reviews on this site look fake: look at the timestamps. 
This seems to be a thinly-veiled plug for coinmixer.net and an attempt to discredit bitmixer.io. This thread makes some interesting background reading:

But one of the four people in Nebraska is Warren Buffett! Maybe this will change his mind about Bitcoin.

I think they're mainly boasting about having a certain fraction of all the bitcoins that will ever exist. That would explain the posts about entering the 21 million club, or whatever it's called.
(No, I'm not in it yet. But I intend to be at some point.)

LibertyX needs to work on that slogan on their front page: “No fees to reward early adopters”. They probably mean that in order to reward early adopters, they are waiving their fees (great!). But I initially read it as “if you're an early adopter and you're hoping for some kind of fee as a reward, you're out of luck”.
Just adding a comma after “fees” would fix this.

I found this post because blockchain.info's front page linked to it. Why would they do that if the post appears to make them look bad? This makes no sense to me.

The FAQ of cashila.com made me laugh. It says:
Q: Do I have to be a resident of one of the countries mentioned above?
A: No. You can live anywhere in the world, except of Iran, Afghanistan, North Korea or New York State.

I wonder if the DEA regrets their use of Force?

It sounds as if Buffett admits "this is a real threat". :)

Thanks for your reply! I didn't know about the Mycelium local marketplace. I'll look into that.

I agree that SLL is a niche thing, but the fact that it can be used as an easy gateway between Paypal and BTC makes it interesting from a BTC point of view, I think.

That was a fascinating and well-written post, and not at all what I expected from the title. (Does that mean that the title was a Trojan Horse?)

Thanks for the data, and for the link. I've seen a similar figure quoted from someone else who converted $20.

While I agree with other posters that there will be a "tidal wave of fuck" in the form of backlash from banks against Bitcoin, I think that the banks will ultimately lose the fight. We'll have to wait and see!

Why not sell gift cards to your store on gyft.com and other similar sites? That way, you will get a reputation as a bitcoin-friendly merchant, and customers won't be surprised to find out that you accept bitcoin directly.

It's not really correct, and it annoys other people too, but if you Google "how does it feel like", you'll find that it's a song lyric.

That was generous! When I grow up, I want to be like you.
(Incidentally, that was my first tip.)

This sounds too good to be true. But cool!

I wonder if this is something to do with tax laws. Did you send a fairly large amount (more than about $500) in a single transaction?
In any case, thanks for your post; I hadn't realized this could happen.

My favorite sentence of the article:
*In addition to bitcoin, Porn.com also accepts litecoin, dogecoin and wankcoin.*
