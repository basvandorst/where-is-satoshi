It's illusional to say so at the scale bitcoin is reaching. You need complex infrastructures and you have two choices:. 
- either acknowledging so and organize in a way that those infra remain under community control (aka: foundation). 
- keep telling the Story of the "no centralized bla bla" and then remain hostage of whoever has the most resources, willing to invest millions/billions to effectively control the market and bending the community interests.   
What is happening right now is  with all sorts of forking and Mad discussions. That being said, I would gladly donate to a foundation willing to spend the money to keep core Independent and to invest in an indipendent infrastructure of full-nodes

Can you elaborate? I'm trying to understand, not trolling here. I'm new to Bitcoin and clearly I need ti shift my pow.

Many of us are on the same ship. Keypoint here is "I will regret if..."
There is a chance btc will reach skyrocket valuation in the next few years and people buying now will be considered as "early adopters"' (afterall it's still not widely used nor considered a financial asset), then there's a chance something happens and its value drops to toilet-paper-value.
Nobody knows. I personally think it's already too big to fail and the financial community is desperate to find new ways to speculate. So, I think you should still take a shot investing what you can lose. Worst case you lose It and life goes on, best case you have assets if it reaches the stars.

So, actually there is a bitcoin foundation!
@_date: 2017-08-13 22:40:30
Just stating the obvious to an obvious question.
@_date: 2017-08-24 09:18:52
Allright, I got It. Funny thing, I just realized the whole SegWit thing was promoted by Charlie Shrem, One of guys behind the foundation.
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:30:12
First of all, ignoring USD ratio is just stupid. Hold until bitcoin value settles, then cut losses on obvious shitcoins. Keep some alt (I suggest: monero, zcash, eth) diversifying as they seem to have enough traction, stop loss on others and convert them to bitcoin. That would be my plan. At this time you need to stop being stupidly emotional and to keep your shit together. In 2-4yrs you'll be fine.
I'm talking out of experience after surviving a 1M loss on stocks a few years ago. Keep in mind that the only true priority is to have enough cash to feed your family, that's what you really need to secure.
@_date: 2017-08-24 08:23:43
I'm not sure how is getting downvoted. I think it's a genuine and useful discussion to have
@_date: 2017-08-24 08:42:01
Allright, so just to put things in place: there's a foundation with 0 support from the community and not involving at all the core devs, correct?
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:59:28
I've seen a few of this on Bitstamp too. Given that I strongly think there's someone pumping equally across markets, I think this is due to the thicker and how the frontend is visualizing stuff. Just because you see it, doesn't mean the system is actually in that state. Those two could have been cleared instantly but the frontend could still show them (for whatever reason)
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:42:40
It does if It creates a ladder towards bottom of big chunk of orders. Basic psychology here
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:07:08
Wrong link.
@_date: 2017-08-15 22:15:00
Someone might track you down, stalk you and try to get your pass/seed
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:26:11
Could be due to transaction fees? On 25 10$ fee seems very High but still, only plausible reason I Can think of
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:43:33
As long as you don't invest more than that, keeping your btc on coinbase or Kraken is reasonable (have a safe password). It will take away a lot of complexity in handling your self-hosted wallet. Using a wallet in your computer is also a good option, electrum is good option, make sure to back up and keep secure the seed of the wallet.
If you plan to invest more (10k or more), keeping funds on Kraken or coinbase is not recommended and a secure wallet is mandatory to keep funds safe. Electrum can still be ok but an hardware wallet is just a lot more secure (trezor or ledger are the most common solutions).
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:06:41
Safe means that it's extremely unlikely to have been infected by malware or keyloggers. For example: i feel confident that one of my linux machines, recently formatted and that I don't use in dodgy ways is "safe" enough.
You access the electrum wallet by launching it, as a normal program. It will ask for a password you have defined while setting up the wallet. During set-up it will also give you a seed, a list of words that are the secret used by the wallet to identify your btc address. Just choose a reasonably difficult password, write it down somewhere. Then write down the seed somewhere the dog won't eat the piece of paper.
Once you have done all this, you are good to go. Transfer you btcs on your wallet and it's going to be safe. If for any reason your computer breaks, you can recover the btcs using the seed that you stored safely.
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:44:01
You all seem to ignore how those orders were placed downward (at which price), encouraging whoever is willing to sell to do a small compromise and just get rid of the coins
@_date: 2017-08-24 08:54:31
Thanks for sharing this, very interesting. I still don't get how It relates to have a community-backed datacenter of full-nodes somewhere and managed by a foundation.
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:32:24
Not strictly related to Bitcoin but still relevant as the storm of ICOs and shitcoins seems growing and growing. Not playing with altcoins in the near future.
This article pretty much sums up everything that is broken with alt
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:48:49
What trading tool is this?
@_date: 2017-08-13 22:17:02
Sell High, buy low. Re-buy as they go under 4000$
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:59:56
These are actually coherent preditions. Goldman Sachs analyst is saying price will soon crash to recover over time, second analysis is setting a mid-term target for dec 2017.
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:31:47
Where did you buy the chrystal ball? I want One too! Please stop sharing stupid baseless advices.
@_date: 2017-08-24 09:02:02
Basically a "GTFO". Not sure how joining will help with this simple discussion and I won't as I'm a supporter of Bitcoin and not of alt-coins created out of the blue by someone personal interests.
It's very frustrating to talk on this subreddit as people seems uncapable of having any sort of discussion without giving bitchy answers. Seems like the only allowed posts here are memes
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:59:56
I know very well how exchanges work :) those were not spoofings, they all went through. Anyway, forget this thread
@_date: 2017-08-24 08:48:35
Pretty cool and and thanks for sharing this. It makes a lot of sense. 
Still I think we are reasoning at too high level on the principles and ignoring entirely that devs are people and hashing power are servers. By saying that we would benefit of a foundation, I'm not saying that we Need a "Bitcoin CEO" as someone mentioned. I'm saying that we can make distributed technical committees, take choices based on consensus (such as now, no big changes here) but also manage more practical aspects in a structured way such as running a 0 fees datacenter funded by donations or &lt;currency_of_whatever_state&gt;
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:09:05
Can anyone explain this graph?
@_date: 2017-08-24 08:38:28
Sure, as much as the first statement is your opinion. That's what "discussing" is all about: exchanging opinions. And I backed and elaborated my opinion too, if not to show that It was not just something thrown there without any prior thoughts.
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:41:15
Buy on any exchange, move to an eletrum wallet and put the seed somewhere safe. I know nothing about mobile wallets, they seem a terrible idea if the phone get stolen or breaks. So choose one where your btcs will be safe
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:48:48
Terrible idea to share this on the internet.

Contrary to you, I'm new to btc but have already invested a significant chunk of money in btc. I feel you when It comes to uncertainty. Talking only for myself, this is my "plan":
Keep my positions with real balls of steel and carefully planning some sort of crypto strategy by diversification. Let me also say a few things in favour of btc:
It is winning right now institutional investors confidence. They are probably ignoring all the drama and the technical risks. If any crypto will sicceed reaching super-nova critical mass, that will be bitcoin core. If bitcoin core gets doomed by whatever competitor, the whole crypto market Will be doomed, all confidence Will be Lost and our investment Will be gone. Can this happen? Yes, of course. Will this happen? I doubt. Why? It's already too big to fail and traditional funds, investors and banks are struggling finding new profitable investments where traditional channels do not provide enough of a ROI
Not sure if I was anyhow of a comfort, yet be sure you are not alone in this. Place your bet and we will see what happens next.
@_date: 2017-08-24 08:33:52
This is quite funny, it's actually true but I had 0 intention to give that impression!
I'm not a FUD guy, all my other posts are connected to my day-trading activity (there's a reason they are not on where fluctuation is part of the game. Beside this, I do strongly believe in BTC and in its success mid-to-long term.
Still, I think this was a question I had to ask. I'm fairly new to btc and having this kind of discussions helps me understanding how this community thinks
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:45:25
While you are waiting for your trezor, move the funds to a safe computer on an electrum wallet, make sure to keep your seed safe. That's all
@_date: 2017-08-14 07:28:48
Directly from exchanges, no? Bitstamp exposes Apis, just to mention one.
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:31:25
How much do you plan to invest?
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:44:10
Just a confirmation that this is an attempt by few individuals to overtake the brand "Bitcoin" and make a few bucks out of it, while spreading FUD and buying from worrying people.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:53:31
Yes, you Can. Use the seed of your wallet in a bitcoin cash wallet. They are there waiting for ya
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:55:06
I know Little about the internals of bitcoin, can you confirm that setting up full-nodes will help the Bitcoin network processing transactions? If so, I'll setup a few.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:33:47
I don't think there's a bubble.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:29:03
I'm not. I'm just telling everyone what I'm doing and just to stay strong. It will get better
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:50:59
I do, It will happen pushing adoption. If ETFs are Launched, this Will give a massive boost to Bitcoin price and a lot of stability
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:40:45
Disagree on this. Cryptos are not Just a financial product pumped and oversold. They are a fundamental shift in financial history, the kind of shift that will likely cause big swings of Power as well.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:49:03
Agree on this. This is a user-based bulleting board, I'm no financial advisor and just talking for myself. I have no other interest other than profiting from my own investments and by no mean you should think that what I say is future-proof. This is just my own opinion as I'm going thru this mess.
Surely, I don't appreciate whales manipulating the market with the concrete risk of vaporizing my own savings.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:00:45
Bitstamp is regulated, to mention one. Honestly I think ETFs are going to happen and in a reasonable time
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:38:19
Why not Greenaddress? That would be my preferred choice.
