Do the domic o'brien 's memorization course, then memorize your private keys and rest assured no one will find them.
Or just generate the private keys in an offline computer, then write them down where no one will find them

To be clear...are you referring to improving one thing about Bitcoin the technology or the ecosystem in general?
From a tech perspective: Bitcoin core, blockchain and user interface comprehensive security measures
From a broader ecosystem perspective: Bitcoin Branding, Marketing, PR and Media Relations

Bitcoin could ultimately replace fiat, but both will coexist for many years. The reason for this possible outcome is that if you can pay everywhere with bitcoin there exists no advantage to use and hold fiat. With bitcoin you can do everything you can do with fiat. On top of that you can do many things easier (for example money transfers) and you don't risk inflationary devaluation by holding bitcoin.
When bitcoin reaches majority adoption central banks might realize that they've lost control of monetary policy. In turn they might fade out the fiat system, because they only incur costs from it without influencing economy.

Q: What do you do when someone steals your Bitcoins?
A: Bitch on the Internet about it until every newspaper is talking about you, and obfuscate the details enough to make people think you're lying, and then have lengthy debates about the truth.

Do you mean that Bitcoin is faster than the speed of sound or what? 
@_date: 2014-08-30 12:16:58
I think Bitcoin is not to replace the already existing currency but rather as an alternative currency for international transactions. 
The surplus is the speed of transactions and transaction costs are low (fixed rate)

Even if there was I doubt you'd be able to tailor it so specific to when Amazon starts accepting it. You could use rs feeds but you're still probably just going to have to keep your ear to the ground in some way.
