Sry, but for me even the price doesnt reflect the health of bitcoin. I think bitcoin has became an investment for many people.
The only thing i care about is the user experience and the technology, and right now the hight fees, the fact that changes takes years to come, and the fact that most of the best developpers works on other alts (mainly ether) make me doubt.
I believe that bitcoin may not be the god currency everybody in this sub think it is, and other alts could easily take its place.
I just want to understant, what instead of its current reputation, make bitcoin better than other ? (liker ether for example, witch already has a dynamic block size, many many developments coming, and very low fees).
Sry for my bad english by the way

The danger is that competitors will use this time to develop faster and then bitcoin could become useless

Ether would be able to adapt better than what bitcoin is actually doing ...
And lightning networks are also coming soon to ether, mmaybe before bitcoin lol

I just want to understand why people think bitcoin is the best...
What do you think about the 60 cents fees when you can use other alts for just 0.2 cents fees ? And confimations in less than seconds ?
I agree bitcoin still has a lot of traction from its name and investors but dont tell me to wait for bitcoin to evolve, because actual users only care about right now.
Other alts make real evolutions in that time ...
PS : sry for my bad english

if you printed the private key, you will be able to recover your funds. try to import your private key in a desktop wallet.
