Thank you so much, Your contribution to the community far exceeds mine. However, one thing I *would* like to see from you more is your opinions. You seem like a very experienced person, and yet there is a surprising and disappointing lack of material that could be potentially extremely enlightening coming from you. You seem like you are well versed in economics, politics, and Bitcoin in general and I'm sure the community would benefit even more if you shared your knowledge more freely with the world.
Not to mention, you are one of, if not *the*, most generous person I have come across. As much as I would like to think that if I saw something extremely enlightening I would reward them, in reality, I probably would not. You are a far greater person than me for not being as greedy as I am. :P

The Miner fee goes to the person who mined the block in addition to the 25 XBT they receive on top. The idea is that in many years when the reward is nearly 0, and an insane amount of people are using Bitcoin, there will be enough Miner's Fee to satisfy the miner.

I'm not a merchant, but as far as I know (or at least what I would do) is create a friendly interface on you iPad that hooks up to BitPay somehow.
BitPay provides a nice interface and an escrow service to a certain degree.
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:46:17
Yes, but it's quite discouraging even so. It could be a loss of time or whatever for the Bitcoiner, but it could be the gain of another potential Bitcoiner.
As highlighted in that "Dogecoin wtf" post, because of their much more friendly demeanor, they are growing at an alarming rate faster than Bitcoin. The unwelcoming attitude towards the incompetence of others may seem fair, but it has deep negative effects towards the growth of Bitcoin.
Instead of ignoring the user, and downvoting them, or saying "Read the fucking sidebar," you could simply answer the question and remind them at the end that most of this information should be in the sidebar.
@_date: 2014-05-16 01:42:44
Yes actually! With Bitcoin you can have literally any transaction fee you want (0% to infinity I guess), it will just take longer to process the smaller the fee and quantity transacted. However, the only limiting factor is the merchant gateway used (Bitpay charges fees)

@_date: 2014-04-05 02:44:56
I don't know if you understand how mining *actually* works. The 51% attacks are utter bullshit, forget about it. In reality, double spending and the manipulation of blockchain will almost never be possible even if you have two major companies of 50% 50% each. Manipulating the chain will just break Bitcoin.
Edit: It will break it because clients (especially those doing verification) will not know which one to trust, will verify it themselves, and see that both of them are bullshit

1. The computational power is used to check the validity of transactions and put them in a cryptographically secure manner that provides the basis for the next block to function. In other words, the power is very, very useful. Not only does it provide a proof of work, but it validates transactions (to make sure they're not spending coins they don't have, etc), but it puts that information in such a way that the next block will fit in.
2. I am no expert, however, probably not. They say Bitcoin wasn't premined. However, perhaps 6 million coins were mined before Bitcoin was a "thing" on the internet.
3. No! Mining *validates* transactions. It makes sure people who send money to someone else are not spending money they don't have, are not sending the same money to multiple people, are not sending it to an invalid address, and they are updating the balance of the receiver. Simply, mining is literally the backbone of the entire Bitcoin structure. And it is rewarded by being given more Bitcoins.
4. I'm not an expert on that. But what I do know is that it doesn't take the typical "51%" attack. You need way more than 51% the hashing power, so good luck with that.
5. I don't know about that.
6. Ah! Because some people, including I, value the ease of transactions more than the money itself. If my coins are exponentially growing… what's the point if I don't use them?

What happened yesterday?
@_date: 2014-02-20 19:36:55
Hi! I’m 13.
To get your first bitcoins, you will need to use an online exchange. Think of it as a store for bitcoin - But they only sell Bitcoins for dollars, and dollars for bitcoins.
There are many exchanges. I believe the most trusted and user friendly one is bitstamp. Go to  and create an account.
The thing is, you will need an adult if you want to exchange bitcoins! This is because you need to provide the necessary documentation such as ID, Proof of Recidancy, and you will need access to a bank account. 
I would suggest you introduce your parents to bitcoin. Show them how cool it is, and tell them you want to invest in it. Bitstamp will have a *verify* tab. Click on that, and show that to your parents.
Once they have verified your account, it may take a few days, you can transfer dollars into your account. Do this by clicking deposit, and follow the instructions.
From there, it should be pretty straight forward.
**No adult?**
If you don’t have any adult willing to help you, you have to use local bitcoins. If you live in a populous city like New York City, or San Francisco or Los Angeles, Miami, this should be really easy. *P.S. If you live in San Diego shoot me a PM! I'll help you.* 
Go to  and sign up. What this website basically does is helps you exchange bitcoins for cash. You'll have to physically meet up with another person, give them the cash, and they will send you the bitcoins.
I hope it works out for you!!
@_date: 2014-02-04 06:27:07
Fuck man you beat me to it.
@_date: 2014-06-18 23:41:01
I normally would, but here's the thing:

2. He's kinda my friend, and was looking to getting into bitcoin
3. It was such a small transaction that those fees wouldn't even make sense
@_date: 2014-04-06 01:57:02

1. While Bitcoin may seem large at first, it's quite small considering the potential it has. During the first crash of 2011, Bitcoin crashed at around $10. Everyone panicked, saying we're all doomed and it's not worth investing anymore. Nobody believed it would go any higher than $10. Then, in 2013, it crashed again at $100. Nobody believed it could go any higher, nothing could happen more. Later that same year — $1000. Who knows what could happen next?
2. No! Believe me, no use at all. Don't even look into it. You might think, "Hey, at least I'm doing a service to the network." You're not. Your one computer is so small in the hashing network that it's practically negligible in counting the total hashing power. Plus you'll spend in incredible amount electricity more than you will earn Bitcoins.

The Apple typography really isn't too good itself.
* Spacing way too small. Optimal spacing is something between 120%–135%
* Dodgy font
* First line indents — Spacing after paragraph generally provides a cleaner look
* Unnecessary indenting
* Massive mother-fucker of a centered title. A smaller, more streamline, and maybe left-justified title would have looked better
* Extremely dodgy logo placed comically close to the text
^Typography ^is ^beautiful.

Yes. Bitcoin is very private if used properly. Mixing services help with this. Blockchain.info has a mixing service built in to their wallet if you need. However, for the casual user, even without mixing, Bitcoin is private enough.
The Bitcoin transfer speed is already really high. In fact, it is almost immediate (it just takes a little bit of time to be verified, and can be sped up by giving a greater miner's fee). However, blocks are only created every 10 minutes.

Yes but these subreddits might not be very well known (for example I have just found out about /rbitcoinbeginners). Although you might not promote some of these questions, it is very discouraging to have rude remarks said due to your curiosity. Either
* Promote these specific subreddits in a visible manner
* Don’t turn down those with misinformation (or lack thereof) with useless, rude remarks.

3. After the 21 million coins are mined, there will hopefully be so many users such that the transactions fee are sufficient to reward the miner.
5. Oh.
6. Yes. Bitcoin is not accepted many places. Hopefully that will change as we grow though.

This is awesome! I'm 13 too, and I'm glad there's other people my age using Bitcoin. I recently sold like .06 XBT for around $50, but unfortunately my person got angry that I made a %20 markup so I reimbursed him, haha.

@_date: 2014-02-04 23:18:29
It's never too late to get started. When XBT was worth $10, people thought it was too late. When it was worth $100, people thought it was too late (10x increase! Never going to happen again). And now when it's $1000, it's foolish to think it's too late.
Mining is never viable. If you're looking for profit, don't go to mining.

The API of Bitcoin is available always. Even if the official Bitcoin-QT becomes corrupt (which it will probably not as it is open source and could be forked at any time), others will still develop wallets with the same API that works the exact same way.

The value of Bitcoin is determined by the buyers and the sellers — The more people want to buy Bitcoin, and the harder it is to acquire, the pricier to is.
It's basic economics, the most valuable something is the pricier it is.

Yeah but that video was pretty mathematical in principal. The lightning network starts getting really technical with things like multisig and etc and it becomes more about programming and less about math.

I sold back at like $1000, bought at $100. Every day I grow to hate myself more.
On the plus side, the pocket change that I left in bitstamp because it was too little it wasn’t worth withdrawing is now like $500, so that’s cool.

I'm a democrat, however Paul's policies are significantly better than any other viable democratic candidate so far. Hilary is a tool, catering to her "donors." Paul takes a stand for what he believes in. I believe Paul would get shit done if elected.
I don't necessarily agree with every policy of his though. His stance on health care, abortion, and gay marriage is shaky. But he holds our constitutional rights in high regard. Our first amendment, second, and fifth amendment rights will definitely be held under him.
His economic policies seem to be on point, too. Hilary wants to cut deficit spending by raising taxes. However, she spends money wastefully. Rand wants to decrease federal spending and move many things to the states. This is much more solid and plausible.
Too bad I can't vote. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:04:56
I’m the opposite. Used up my bitcoins back when they was worth like $300. Now I’m sitting here thinking that if I hadn’t bought stupid shit that I didn’t even need I’d be up like $20k
@_date: 2015-07-04 20:23:29
Not solely because he accepts Bitcoin. But rather, he's much better than any other democratic candidate out there. Plus, he's explicitly said he'd leave gay marriage laws to the states (so although his beliefs are not for them, nothing will change.) His stances on the NSA, the militarization of police, drone, the unlawful murder of American Citizens by Barack Obama, and many other important topics are well aligned with the constitution of our county.
Plus, Rand Paul has said that he believes gays should be able to get married on paper. He has states he doesn't believe it is morally correct, but that they should be allowed to do it.
Hillary, on the other hand, in 2004 gave an extremely anti-gay speech, and now suddenly flip flops her opinion just because it will gain more votes.
@_date: 2017-04-09 07:03:30
Thanks! I decided I should just do some research into it instead of trying to understand in laymens terms. Currently watching the Bitcoin Devs seminar on it. 
@_date: 2017-04-09 06:31:20
How is this useful? How often do two parties send money back and forth between each other? 
@_date: 2017-04-09 06:46:09
So it’s kind of like making Bitcoin optionally centralized? You can either pay a high fee or your transactions are centralized..
@_date: 2017-04-09 20:24:47
Thanks for your guess reply! After watching the seminar last night I think I understand it in its entirety. This will be a pretty great fucking thing for Bitcoin. I've used Bitcoin for like 3 years so I remember back when extremely low fees was something we used to brag about.
The few question is, how will we get consensus for the soft fork if the lightning network will take money from the miners, especially the large mining operators that are actually capable of handling large block sizes? 
@_date: 2018-11-27 19:24:27
I agree with this. A few years ago this sub was all about nice, civil people discussing the potential uses for bitcoin. Now it’s mostly assholes memeing about the price.

mBTC is already a reality. Why make it default for exchanges like MtGox or CampBX? Why make it default for Bitcoin stores?
If someone is selling something for cheap, just choose to put the price in mBTC.
No reason to make it default. It's just a confusing change for people already accustomed to using BTC.
NOT ONLY THAT but the pizza wouldn't be 9 mBTC. It would be 90 mBTC. See, even you got tripped up there.

Since nobody's actually explaining it, here goes.
Bitcoin is a currency like any other (yen, pound, euro, etc). And like 1 euro is worth 1.3 dollars, 1 bitcoin is worth 260 dollars. But why use bitcoin, you may ask. Bitcoin is better than fiat (money distributed by a government) because it is decentralised (Not controlled by any governments or banks or anybody at all), it is over the internet, it takes literally almost nothing in fees (and fees are optional, actually), it is fantastic as you can send money to anybody anywhere over the internet instantly for practically free, without any governments or banks freezing your account or reversing the transaction.
 
Now, you may ask how can you use a currency that is worth $260 for each coin? Well bitcoin, as it is over the internet, can be divided into eight decimal places! This means that one dollar is approximately 0.002 XBT (XBT or BTC are short for bitcoin). 
I'm on mobile and my fingers hurt for typing so much, so I can't explain the magic cryptographically secure portion of it (as I could write an entire essay on it), but you don't need to know that now. Get started on 
And no, it's not too late to get started. Bitcoin will continue to rise and you will make money if you invest wisely. (I invested $300 and have profited over twice that amount)

@_date: 2013-07-08 00:33:18
Ok, 12-year-old here.
I think it's a good idea. But you should do one thing first: Teach them to value money.
I had many friends that didn't understand the try value of money. Their parents (or grandparents, whatever) would spoil them with money, and they wouldn't understand the value. They would spend lots of money on stupid things.
Some kid give me $5 for a pack of Oreo's worth like $1.50 when he could've easily went to a place that sold them like 2 blocks away. Me, being the sneaky merchant I am, accepted :P
Anyway, I wasn't like that (they thought I was cheap) because I earned all of my money through hard work. Just a few days ago I wrote some Python code and earned 0.45 BTC. I value my money the way it should be valued.
Point is, a lot of kids don't understand the real value of money, and making it easy for them to spend money when they don't fully understand money is stupid.
You could teach them to manage money kind of like how they did [here]( Give them some "money" every morning and let them buy little treats with it. Have them do little jobs for you to earn money (but make sure it's hard work!)
Then teach them to use BTC. Maybe use some Testnet coins at first or something.

Hi. I'm contacting the support centre to inform Dwolla of my will to terminate services with your company. This is due to your recent abolishment of business dealings with (supposedly) %0.1 of your merchant base, that is virtual currency exchanges (Including, but not limited to, Bitcoin). I'm sure you will find that this %0.1 garners well over a hundred-fold of your client base, and your actions will affect your profits drastically. However, I am aware that this was a very necessary decision to allow further growth of Dwolla. Thank you for your service.

Also, I know the slightest bit of Java (but I hate that language so much I don't know why but it pisses me off.

I told them that when people do a service for the Bitcoin network, they tell everyone about what they did, and they tell them about the money the received. Then, everyone else checks to make sure that he actually did do the service, and if he did, they let it slide. If he didn't they object.

Obviously considering the few other times this has happened, Bitcoin is bound to fall I reckon to about ~200, and then a few months later rise again to be over ~1000. However, I'm investing in a shorter period. As soon as it starts falling, I'll sell. And when the price is stable at a lower value, I'll buy the same amount.
Nothing rises this fast and stays steady.

I'm saying I go to a school with tons of 12 year olds. Being the kind of person that knows almost everyone, I can tell you none of them like big cute buttons and super dumbed down things.
Sure, for 8 year olds or something that'd be alright. But by the time you turn like 10 you'll start actually having to use the Internet for essays, so there's that

Again thanks for the tip :)

I'm not working on the protocol directly, however, I'm working on the implementation. Killerstorm (Alex Mizrahi) and like two other people (don't know their names) are working on the protocol and API (the real brains) behind NGCCC (Next Gen Coloured Coin Client)
So to answer your question, I don't know. I don't work on the protocol.
However, I can confidently say the client might take like a month if we work on it hard.
Edit: confidently is not the right word, more like hopefully.

Awesome! We're almost the same then! As a C++ developer I was planning in developing a game in my spare time and selling it for BTC. Already have my basic planning down and basic classes. Maybe I'll get some buys when it's finally done!
@_date: 2013-09-29 18:16:42
Very little blockchain bloat? More like nothing. Coloured Coins utilise information already stored in the blockchain - namely the UTXO hash's.
It's an incredible protocol indeed.

Yeah not only would the price of the rest of the coins rise, but I presume Gavin or something would release a new client that A) Add more decimal points or B) converts "old" coins to "new" coins worth a specific known amount more.
I think A would work better, but theoretically both A and B would disrupt the "21 million thing" which kinda sucks.

How is the information stored? And so in order to figure out your balance your client has to go through every single block and figure it out that way? And when you send Bitcoins, the rest of the network has to go through every single block and verify you had enough money? Also, I'm confused with the private key thing... do you know more about the exact technicalities like exactly how blocks are stored?
@_date: 2013-09-11 08:15:43

So do I. Bitcoin is pricey because it's valued. The price really shows how valuable Bitcoin is. It's a good thing that it's worth a high amount. People will think it's very valuable because it's a good idea.
Just saying.

Reading this, I am extremely impressed. 3 girls near my age have written best selling books, and have accomplished a lot in that area, and meanwhile, I struggle to get an A in English. Professional bloggers? Christ, I can't even maintain Plazmotech.net or junctionco.com .
Yes, I would love to work together to make something cool. If you have any ideas, shoot me a PM and I'll give you my email address.
For the record, I know Python, Perl, and C++. Writing iOS apps requires knowledge of Objective C, however using Objective C++ it's easy to write an iOS app with what I know (after doing some reading and stuff)
Edit: seriously right now I am incredibly impressed. Your accomplishments have made mine minuscule, and I am quite jealous.

I honestly would. There are no downsides. Of course, one downside is that you have to buy more, but that downside can be excluded because that applies for any currency (unless you're selling things in the currency which I could do with bitcoins just as easily irl.)

Thanks! But how do people know that the rewarding is authentic? Couldn't someone submit a block where the reward is higher than 25 BTC? What moderates the rewarded amounts, if there is no central server?
How do peers A, B, and C know when peer D logs on. Peer D doesn't have the information about peer A, B, or C, and vise versa. Therefor, how can peer D end up connected to peers A-C?

Did that, transaction was never actually submitted. It's not in the pending transactions.
@_date: 2013-09-29 17:53:26
You would get them from the issuer.
Suppose you are buying gold bricks. The issuer could say "every 0.0001 BTC you receive from this UTXO 4542fe6b5514ff6670e1701eb4690f64b31a35d843af6bd3ca6d2e5b5638bbe3
 will be a gold brick"
Then you plug that into your coloured coin client, and it tells you how many gold bricks you have. Want another? Buy some from the issuer and he will send you another 0.0001 BTC from that UTXO. You can also prove to the issuer you have those bricks because you own, say, 0.0005 BTC coming from that UTXO.
It's a brilliant idea.

Yes, I have been making duct-tape wallets for 2 years. Started when I was 10. Obviously, they were really shitty, which is why I only recently started selling.
Also, my father is a web-developer and web-designer. He got me interested in computers at a very young age. Inevitably, he taught me some Javascript and whatever, but I decided to learn ActionScript2. Then, I started learning Python, then I started learning C++.

I'm really sorry you're getting downvoted. Some people here are jerks, sorry about that. I would highly recommend checking out CampBX. They let you use dwolla and wire transfer. I personally use Dwolla with CampBx and it's very easy and no fees. One problem is there is a holding period of 31 days from the first time depositing USD with dwolla to withdrawing BTC for 31 days. But that's ok since you can use wire transfer while you're waiting. Good luck to you! I'd bitcoin tip you if I wasn't broke

They thought it was a cool idea and would be useful. I told them many people are starting to accept it, and I bought The Humble Inde Bundle 8 with it, and that there are websites like bitmit and coingig where you can buy things with it too.

I got a MacBook when I was 8.
My dad is a web developer and knows JavaScript, PHP, etc, and he got me interested in developing when I was about 9, when I first made very basic "application" in Flash CS3 using ActionScript2 using basic on button down and next frame commands to go through a mini animation.
I went on reading learning AS2 and i learned a bit but nothing really substantial.
I remember being in the car with my dad asking him what language I should learn and he said something like C or Python or Perl. I played this game called Minecraft at the time, and used a tool called MCEdit for it. After learning that it was written in Python, I decided to learn it.
So I just taught myself Python primarily by reading code of others. I got pretty good at it by the time I was 11 and started picking up C++, and then later Perl. But Python always stuck to me and I use it ALL the time to write utilities and to show math and science principals to help myself better understand it.
So, I put an ad on and a guy hired me to help him with his project (his name shall not be disclosed in case he prefers to keep the fact that he hired a 12 year old to help him. 
Edit: I forgot to mention I have Python tutorials on @_date: 2013-06-19 03:56:22
I, for one, calculate prices in my head in bitcoin. However you must think relative to the PPP. You must know the relative price of dollars to buy something in dollars, it would be irrational to buy a candybar for 10 bucks, but it would for 1. 
However, PPP of bitcoin changes a LOT and for larger quantities of currency I'd rather look up prices relative to USD (something that doesn't change much relative to BTC). But for smaller purchases, I assume 0.015 BTC is the price of a candybar approximately
Is this just me?

Hey! This is a really great idea! Try using coingig and bitmit too!
However, instead of saying "Trade x for Bitcoins" say "Buy x for Bitcoins"
It makes Bitcoin seem like a currency. You don't see many people saying "I'm trading this hat for 5 dollars". Essentially they mean the same thing but it has a different feels.

1. No they do not. They simply utilise data *already in the blockchain* to "tag" them.
2. No there are no messages. Basically, every transaction in the network has a hash, and each transaction can be traced back to the output of other transactions. Using this, we can tell if a coin comes from a specific transaction. If the client "tags" that transaction as the genesis transaction, we can then count the amount of coins from that transaction, and that will be that specific coloured coin.

Making more than 21 million bitcoins would devalue each coin thus canceling the need for more bitcoins.
If the supply goes up and the demand stays the same, the price will drop until the equilibrium is found, and this equilibrium would be the same with 21 million bitcoins.

To build on what said,
Say you buy a gold bar from an issuer. The issuer gives you a transaction hash, called the genesis transaction, and says to enter this into your coloured coin client. He also says that ever 0.0001 BTC received from the genesis transaction is a gold bar.
Now if you have 0.0004 BTC coming from that genesis UTXO, you know that you have 4 gold bars!
Basically, transaction hashes are awesome.

No I have not. Do you recommend it?
@_date: 2013-11-12 02:46:25
Ooooh. I did not. Dang.
Edit: I just realised I subconsciously used the same word you used, "Dang." I will not change it as a token of my embarrassment.
@_date: 2013-04-27 22:25:11
IT WORKS :D

Me is 12 and me thinks thus much offense tü me.
In all seriousness though, 12 year olds do not speak like this, contrary to popular belief. In fact, many use Bitcoin just as you might. [You might want to read more here.](

Same here. I made most of my bitcoins by programming a script for a guy who payed me 2 BTC.
However, I've bought ~1 BTC by paying my dad to sent money to my dwolla account then bought through CampBX at about 100$/BTC

Same here. Well done, OP

I think it's a terrible idea. It's childish and unnecessary. Want big fonts and buttons? ZOOM IN. As a 12 year old, I can confidentially say we know how to use the Internet. We don't need cute big buttons to send money. We're not as stupid as most think.
Get a grip.

Dude you are awesome, holy shit. I wish I was so accomplished!
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:01:08
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-08-10 17:52:07
Is it really? Thank you for telling me! I was unaware of that!
@_date: 2013-06-03 04:23:33
That's literally one of the stupidest things I've ever heard.
@_date: 2013-05-01 04:33:12
Alright; I was just trying to give a heads up. If I saw a thread like this one, showing all of these crazy loses, I would've realized how much of an evil trap this is.
@_date: 2013-05-13 06:00:44
I know ): Thanks! And yeah, I do score pretty high on the CST's. :P
@_date: 2013-09-06 14:56:41
I use the website all the time!
@_date: 2013-05-29 04:43:31
I was thinking the same thing as I bought it. It would probably really promote Bitcoin too!
@_date: 2013-09-10 20:53:46
Wow, when I was 5 I didn't even understand how money worked... Haha
@_date: 2013-09-06 08:27:55
I did, it still didn't work. I also tried sending to different addresses, and even different amounts. Nothing worked

BitMe's website redirects to BitBox.
@_date: 2013-08-07 03:19:29
Thanks so much :) A shame it didn't use one of my gifs though!
@_date: 2013-05-06 02:34:39
Simple: It's a currency. Think like dollars, euros, pounds, etc, it's a currency. However, all those other currencies are physical (You can hold a coin of it in your hand). Bitcoin is not - it is digital.
As to making a profit - You don't. Or at least - that's not the intention of it. However, you CAN treat it like a stock market if you would like (buying when the price is low, selling when it's high). Treat it like a currency, not a stock market though.
@_date: 2013-05-05 01:15:25
Dude thanks! The first part was very easy. Now I gotta figure out the second part... I'm writing some quick python scripts to make my job easier.
@_date: 2013-07-17 21:33:53
Thanks for the heads up :/

Now I feel lonely.
@_date: 2013-06-02 19:01:06
Right? Especially something as professional as bitcoin. You don't see the stock market dumbed down with big red x-shaped buttons that say "PANIC SELL"
@_date: 2013-07-23 12:36:13
No. The hash value must be smaller than the target (resulting in a certain amount of leading zeros)
