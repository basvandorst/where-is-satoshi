I can't even verify my identity on that site - I keep answering the questions correctly, and it fails every time.

* takes a week to receive bitcoins when buying directly with your bank account
* no one takes them where I live (so it's not a currency solution, guys)
* market a lot rougher and bouncier than USD
* has a deflationary bias. Who would spend or accept a currency that can double in a day, then divide by half the next day?
* unregulated, unregulated, unregulated - open to massive speculation and exchange tampering....
* doesn't encourage long-term investment, but instead short term profits on a dump
* HOW many times has it crashed now? O_O
What's more fiat than a digital currency that operates on TRUST (like normal fiat does)? The only thing different here is that you've eliminated a physical substance from the equation...
All in all, Bitcoin users HATE fiat, but love BitCoin... which ISN'T fiat? Then cash out their non-fiat fiat digital currency to physical official fiat currency, then reinvest their official physical fiat back into their non-fiat fiat digital currency... but it isn't a currency! IT BE DIGITAL GOLD! Non-fiat fiat digital gold that is supposed to be a replacement currency... with a deflationary bias that can be heavily speculated.
Two words: Pump. Dump. BitCoin does NOT encourage long term investment - it's too bouncy to hold your coins for any significant time - instead, you hold them for a bit and dump on the high. It's the only way to make money off the things, and leads to more instability in the market.
