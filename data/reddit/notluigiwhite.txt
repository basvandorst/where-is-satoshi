My brother. I literally study in a foreign country and play sports 6 days a week for 4 hours each day. I work at the cafeteria in the time I have off for 8$ an hour. I can work 20hours a week MAX. I can not work ANYWHERE else because that requires work study. Please shut the fuck up and let me live my life.

I am a relatively broke college student who did this as an experiment (short term) rather than someone who has the funds or the patience to stay in this until it unfolds in all its beauty.

Will do.

My first job is academics. Second job is called athletics. Third job is working at the cafeteria :)
