It shows NJ

I am being blocked from PA, USA.  My IP shows it is NJ.  Their blocking mechanism needs a little work.

Thanks.  It was more of a FYI for and I have reached out through several channels.

Why would the FBI go after criminals holding peoples sentimental pictures, documents, music, etc for ransom when they can inconvenience the guys getting violent drug crimes of the street?  
For company's I have no sympathy. Any competent IT person should know how to properly do backups. The average computer user I do.  I have dealt with many people who have lost very important data such as wedding footage or baby pictures due to HDD failure. I can only imagine how people feel about them being held for ransom.

I grabbed one this morning at the hotel I was staying at.  While eating breakfast I spotted the Bitcoin logo on someone else's paper.  They had a pile of them at the entrance to the free breakfast area.

Damn!  Maybe I will try $50 once a couple of people have tried it and have left some feedback.  I would recommend at least doing a $20 pin so people can see how it works without risking to much.  I would be pissed if I lost $50 but not so much with $20.  I AM NOT saying you are a shady business, but you can never be to careful with new services regarding bitcoin.
Good luck with the new service. I am hoping it is going to be as awesome as it sounds.

Can I buy any dollar amount I want?  According to the locations I have a place a couple miles from me.  It says to ask cashier for $50, $100, $200 LibertyX pin.  I would love to try it out but with $5-$10 to start.

Keep up the good work Tails
@_date: 2015-01-10 00:56:28
AFAIK the max is $300 per day. More than enough for my purchases. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 23:36:38
Hi :) 
@_date: 2015-01-10 04:32:08
I guess if you buy the $50 minimum at each location.
@_date: 2015-01-10 16:10:19
Do not mention bitcoin.  It will only cause more confusion.  Just say you want a Qpay pin for LibertyX.  I had better luck at a cell phone store as Qpay is commonly used for cell phone payments and buying prepaid minutes.  
@_date: 2015-01-10 01:20:14
I gave them name, address, phone number and email.  No SSN, license, passport, or first born info was required. The ToS mentions they may ask for SSN and other PII but I have not encountered that. 
@_date: 2015-01-10 02:42:02
I did not need to show identification at time of registration or when purchasing at the location.

If you live in a Comcast area there are tons since personal routers act as public hotspots.

Thanks!  I love not having to retype the wifi names since the latest update. Keep up the good work.

This app is legit.  I highly recommend.

The article only says they sold the ATM's not the whole company.  LibertyX has a service where you can buy BTC at participating retail stores.

Exactly what he said.  I was successful after my third try.  The problem IS NOT LibertyX.  The problem is the locations that don't know how to use the QPay system. The third place took less than 5 minutes as the employee was familiar with the Qpay system and just had to lookup LibertyX
I also had a very good experience with customer support regarding the first two locations.

Can i have some?
@_date: 2015-02-26 15:04:32
Awesome.  I have been running a full node for almost a year.  It would be nice to get a little something back for it.
