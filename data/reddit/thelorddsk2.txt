Maybe i should consider Neteller, or selling to people with at least 10 confirmed trades, maybe asking a screenshot of the skrill recent transactions may help to verify there are no stolen funds. Thanks.

How? By going to the bank to make a chargeback? What if they paid with skrill wallet balance, the accounts they use are verified, how in the world will they reverse a clean funds transaction that was authorized by them?

Hmm yes but i could not find that setting, there is one that allows only trades with users with specific btc volume, i put 0,01 on that so people that at least bought btc can contact me, but i didn't see a setting that allows me to set minimum trades completed before opening trade.

Where did i leak? I dont care if i leak my name if that is the problem.

And solved in less than 24 hours by LBC team, guess i am not wasting any more time with newfag scammers, since i enabled the requirement of accept only traders with completed trades.

I didn't share my name only my email, which cant be clicked to spam anyways.

Can be by the same person perhaps, that guy is scamming 24/7 with no consequence at all.

See by yourself, try and register, ask for a loan, give collateral, if somehow invalid for him, he will red your account and you will be good by leaving the forum forever or creating another account. This guy is a pedophile, perv and a hero member of the darknet black market, dont know how people trust him.
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:09:58
Then i will repost it on the darknet related subreddit. If it doesn't feets here, maybe there.
