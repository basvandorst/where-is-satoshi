I was only referring to the US. Even here the bank has to report transactions over $10k and if you do what is called “structuring”, to avoid that reporting, you are even more likely to get in trouble. There was a famous case of this recently involving a retired veteran who immigrated to the US only to see the government take his money and his business away when the bank had advised him to make deposits under $10k.

That's completely ridiculous. People move way more funds than that ALL the time and there are no issues.

GDAX is a trading platform and Coinbase is more the retail “wallet” that people are accustomed to. Not everyone understands or wants to understand how to use a trading platform to make buys or sells.

There’s no intrinsic value to education in the sense that it is an intangible asset determined by highly variable conditions that vary by individual. Just because two people have the same degree from the same university with the same grades and classes doesn’t mean they have an equivalent value in terms of what their education can get them in the form of compensation.
A degree is more like a key that is part of a set of keys of which not all are necessary to unlock the door. As an intangible asset there is no “intrinsic” value to education. It’s more like a catalyst for other outcomes if you choose the right combination of decisions that will lead to the outcome of “monetary conpensation,” which can take many forms such as a job, an invention, or a business.

Greenhouses in Iceland use a lot of electricity coming from lamps. There is not enough sun in the winter for growing. Their electricity is cheap so this heat recycling concept might work in Iceland. Water is also plentiful there.

you have no idea what you're saying. Bitcoin will be the world's best performing currency 6 of the last 7 years and for 2017 that probably will go to Litecoin or Ethereum is my guess. Despite the volatility there has been little to justify the apocalyptic predictions that some are so eager to spout.

When you consider valuation in terms of scarcity you need to consider that valuations happen through exchanges, i.e. markets that allow price discovery. The fact that a few million dollars potentially enters can be offset relatively easily by the overall trading volume of ~$800 M - $1 B, that is, max 2% of total trading volume.
Your strategy of hodling only makes sense in an upward trending market. If we both have the same amount of crypto, and you hodl and I sell at the top or near the top of the market, and then buy back in near the bottom or at a few intervals through the downtrend, then you've effectively become a lot poorer than me because I now own significantly more coin than you. If we experience an extended bear market like 2014-2016 then my strategy will allow me to gain even more economic leverage.
What the crypto rich don't tell you is that they either 1) they don't need to hodl because they don't own any coins and have already significant investments in other areas or 2) their large coin portfolio is traded frequently for riskless gains since they can easily influence market conditions through collusion with other large coin holders.
Don't 'hodl' the bag when others are understanding market dynamics to increase their wealth while you just get poorer. Bitcoin and exchanges are all subject to significant regulatory risk. We really haven't seen the "black swan" of crypto yet, and I would not be so dreamy and optimistic about retiring in 7 years because we're not even halfway there with crypto.  A lot can happen in our current tech climate in 7 years.

Also I was not rude to you. Why don't you wrap your balls around some other orifice so the rest of us don't have to deal with them flapping all over your face like some prepubescent child. You act like this r/btc.

WTF are you talking about moron? I've been to a fucking greenhouse in Iceland that grows tomatoes so I know exactly how they grow them. There is minimal sunlight for several months of the year. I love how reddit dipshits love slinging their insults with their 4th grade educations...

It was bubble just like selfie-sticks, etc. While no one is saying that crypto is dead, it could enter a bear market and have to limp along until the next big innovation comes along.
