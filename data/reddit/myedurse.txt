Fair points, although again, Bitfinex seemed just fine and reliable, a thousand times more trustworthy than the Bad Old Days of Mt Gox. Until one day, the unthinkable turned out to not be unthinkable at all. 
Whether Bitfinex (before it's recent hack) or Coinapult is/was more trustworthy is tricky to say. 
Agree about regulatory risk.
I think we largely agree. There is a risk with any 3rd party. If you insist on using one, the burned of judging that risk is upon yourself.

If you buy coins on Coinbase, then don't move them to your own wallet outside Coinbase, then you have left your funds on Coinbase. 
What matters is: If Coinbase went offline today - can you access your coins?
If not, then you are "keeping money in the bank, not in your mattress", with Coinbase being a bank. What people are talking about here in the forum is that you should always make sure you keep your coins in your mattress (your local wallet) although you should use various methods to secure that "mattress". 
But leaving your coins in your "bank account" on Coinbase is risky, as Coinbase could shut down, or be forced to hand your coins over to some authority or whatever. If you have them in your mattress, and your mattress is properly secured, they are considered more secure.

How many people have a credit card with enough credit to allow compensating for a car?
They need a deposit, and your identity so they can pursue you in court. They always get your ID, and a deposit in cash is safer than a deposit in a (potentially stolen / invalid) credit card. Shoul you steal the car, the rental firm will use your deposit to cover their own insurance costs, and then proceed legally. 
I don't see how credit card adds any additional safety for them in the situation, unless it is used for identification purposes, which is possible but downright idiotic.
It is probably more about not wanting to keep large sums of cash available - and being obedient to their bank that has been telling them "card only" is the future way to go.

It's certainly not trivial. However, neither is fiat. Consider the loops and hoops you have to go through in order to open and manage bank accounts and cards, not getting ripped off by credit card peddlers, look through the scams and shams, avoid getting your credit card stolen, or "just" your identity and *then* have credit cards taken out in your name. Heck, most people take *a lot* of precautions every day even with cash ("let's not walk this dark alley at night  with my 100 dollar bills casually sticking up from my back pocket", "this street corner seller wants to borrow my credit card just for a little while, maybe that is not a good idea"), in order not to get their money stolen.
When you look at all that you realise that in fact, if the same standards for "ready for mass adoption" set for bitcoin, were applied to fiat, then *fiat is not ready for mass adoption*
Yet, obviously people somehow manage to sort of use fiat. It has taken them  a lot of time and learning to get to that point. Switching to bitcoin is inevitably going to take some effort from the individual, but not because bitcoin is much more complicated than fiat (it isn't), but because it means learning a new paradigm. It mean somewhat relearning how you've done "money" all your life. It is *new*, but not much more complex, if at all.

In that case, neither is it living on BTC to use SEPA transfers through intermediaries. But you just posted a long list of "services to pay bills" above - all of which does exactly that.
So anyone who uses the fiat credit card networks to send money to those who refuse to accept bitcoin, must be condemned as a heretic in The Church of Bitcoin_forever.
But when you use the SEPA transfers through an intermediary company who has a fiat bank account that you get to utilize in exchange for sending that intemediary bitcoins, then it is all fine and valid "use of bitcoin"?
Such hypocricy.
The truth is that anyone who lives in the real world in 2016 sometimes have to interact with institutions that do not yet accept bitcoins as payment. They will only accept fiat. Use whatever workaround to convert your coins to fiat in order to make that payment. 
Prepaid debit cards is just as vaild a way to do this as  using an intemediary to make a SEPA transfer for you.

So Airbnb are choosing to be the PayPal or MySpace of the sharing economy. After an initial attempt to move to a new decentralized internet-based system, an initial spur of innovation, they choose to get stuck in legacy systems.
Fair enough, PayPal have made a ton of money, but the future do not belong to them and they have ceded a wide open niche to whomever comes to take it, while the "facebook of money" is still waiting to be born (and it will be born on the blockchain), until they get swept away.

Unecessarily complicate is legio with these ~~scams~~ schemes the credit card issuers run.

I think what is going to happen before the banks collapse is that the London real estate market is going to crash and burn. That then leads to banks crashing and burning. Then the crashing and burning spreads outwards as other real estate and equity markets crash abroad, and then banks abroad as well.

It is not usually how great wars start, although it might be how the ground is laid for future wars. Both WWI and WW2 started when the economies were on an uptrend. Especially WWI started at a time when everything was pretty stable - perhaps too stable, and the war became a catalyst for long overdue change, not the other way around. WW2 was clearly a delayed consequence of two troubled economic decades, especially in Germany, but elsewhere too, but in the late 1930s things were finally beginning to look up.
The worrying thing of course is that we're approaching the end of our own 1-2 decades of troubled times. So many parallels between the 1930s and the 2010s.

There is also the advantage of paper wallets with them being fairly easy to comprehend. You can hold it in your hand and you know that anyone who has ever held it in their hand could potentially steal it. But as long as you have it, and you feel sure no one else has snuck a peak and snapped a pic, then it's yours, all yours.
Sometimes this is preferable to putting your money on flimsy hardware gadgets, no matter how much you convince yourself you got the mnemonic seed safely secured.
Of course, there is the downside with paper wallets of potential theft, fire, earthquake etc, and your coins are either literally stuck to one location or (if you make multiple copies and place them in different cities or whatever) increased risk of theft. As for putting them in a bank vault or safe deposit box in a bank... well, then you are back to being subject to the whims of banks and governments again. IMHO it violates the principle of "if you don't hold it, you don't own it", but to each their own.
There is also I suppose the option to set the wallets up with multisig and hand an attorney a sealed envelope with one of the keys for you or whatever. In that scenario even if an evil bankman snuck a peak at your paper wallet, your coins would still be safe, at least until your attorney is compromised as well (which would be hard if you never told anyone who he is, but then you have the problem of what happens to your assets if you are hit by a truck and your heirs don't know how to get your coins).
I guess in the end there is as many ways to secure your coins as bitcoin users.

Large institutional investors would be lost, so short term price would plummet, but there is more than enough of others and underground market who would take over, and since bitcoin's core value proposition is censorship resistance anyway, in the long run it would possible be to it's benefit to not be co-opted by the fascists.

Never having moved doesn't mean it will never move, even less does it mean they cannot move. Every coin has a *probability* of never again moving. Some coins a higher probability, some a lower.

Let's say the entity "humanity" is divisible down to atomic level. If a human consists of approximately 10^28 atoms, and there is somewhat less than 10 billion humans, then humanity is made up of on the magnitude of 10^38 atoms. If we count all humans who ever existed in the past, those aren't really that many, most estimates state around 100 billion humans to have ever existed. So that still only gets us up to 10^39 atoms.
However, Cryptolution's number has 91 decimals, so he is either saying that 1/10^93 of humanity contributed as much as Gavin, or that the bitcoin-contributing fraction of Gavin is just 1/10^93 of humanity. 
This gives us a headache with the atomic divisibility, because even the entire freaking Universe isn't made up of more than 10^82 atoms all in all (and that's the most generous estimate I found, some say maybe even 10^78). Even if we define "humanity" as the entire Universe, which I guess would move us into Deepak Chopra territory already ("we are all one; all of Universe are part of us; etc"), we are still 10^11 units short.
I presume we could either make humanity/Universe even further divisible, going down to elementary particles - I guess there are a helluvalot of photons in the Universe (can't find a handy estimate of this), although we'd be forced to be going further down the Chopra rabbit hole ("it's all energy fields man, we're all just energy!").
Basically, we've just reduced Gavin's contribution to bitcoin to perhaps one Gavin-associated photon at one point doing something amazing.  Or alternatively, there is one badass photon swirling around in the humanity-intertwined energy fields of the Universe which *has made a larger contribution to bitcoin than Gavin*. 
What and where is this mysterious photon? What did it do? More importantly - Could that badass photon be Satoshi? or at least the flash of genius that gave her the idea? Either way - thanks Photon!

You don't seem to understand what Andreas is saying.
What Craig did, and Andreas refused to take part in, is to use *appeal to authority as proof of him being Satoshi, instead of using cryptographic proof*. The authority here being appealed to is that of Gavin Andresen, Andreas Antonopoulos etc. "Listen folks, these famous people confirm I am Satoshi, therefore I am Satoshi!" 
When he could instead have said "Listen folks, here is cryptographic proof that I am Satoshi. Boom."
That's appeal to authority instead of trustless cryptographic proof, that is *the exact opposite of what bitcoin is all about*. The irony of the alleged Satoshi doing things that backwards at least didn't escape Andreas, and he refused to take part in such a ridiculous charade.
@_date: 2016-05-03 22:27:20
Two reasons. Firstly because Satoshi is presumed to have so many. Possibly upwards of 1 million coins, although a more probable number is maybe half of that or less, but still a massive truckload of coins. If these were to enter the market it would flood it.
Secondly, it is priced in that Satoshi will never move his coins. It's just how the expectation game is set. And the expectations game is also set to the condition "If Satoshi moves his coins, there will be panic". So if he does move his coins, there will be panic because everyone knows there will be panic selling. 
Also, generally it is bad vibes when the founder suddenly seem to be selling off. If it was revealed that Mark Zuckerberg has secretly been selling off his Facebook stash (I know that may not technically be possible given strict insider regulations, but you get the point), that would give everyone some cause for panic. What does he know that we don't? Or just "Wait what, even *he* no longer believes in this project!?"

Price dropping on this news was entirely predictable. Fear and uncertainty = dump. 
I'm surprised it hasn't dropped more already, but I guess that because more people than expected are suspicious of his claims. If he had been convincing, and key people really did believe Satoshi is in fact a shady and infamous Australian conman who may need to sell off his stash to pay off his tax debts, I could easily see a price plunge to the 200s or lower.
@_date: 2016-05-02 17:57:50
No need to move, you can just sign. Moving just to prove your point has several other implications and would be a dumb way of proving it.
Secondly, if you move the coins that ARE ASSUMED belong to the creator, it's not complete evidence, because this is not known for sure.
Thirdly, even if those coins once belonged to the creator,  which is a reasonable assumption but not entirely certain, then that still doesn't prove they are *still* owned by him. In fact, even Wright himself claims (or claimed) that the keys had been transferred to some other entity. This means that even ownership of the keys isn't proof.
Fourthly, the real Satoshi could easily have lost they keys in the 7 years since. Of course this would mean we would never know for certain.
I agree that anyone who can be proven to hold the keys to the presumed Satoshi coins is probably Satoshi, but it iks not certain and your attempt to make it black and white is very simplified.
For full disclosure, I do not believe Wright is Satoshi. At all. The point is that it is hard to prove with full certainty either way.

The thing with RT is that their policy positions, or whatever we call it, are for Western audiences, and is what Russia would want the West to do, which can be completely opposite to what they want to do themselves within Russia. Nothing new. Soviet propaganda and media manipulation in the West during the cold war was all "hey, let's go nuclear free and be all disarmament and freedom of speech and stuff!", while simultanously pursuing the exact opposite behind the iron curtain. 
Similarly US propaganda of course. "Hey, you Russians! Whistleblowers and journalists must be protected and fair elections and no media manipulation please, you commie bastards!". While none of that applies more than superficially at home.
RT is not in any way indicative for Russian internal policies. It's purely a propaganda tool to manipulate the west in a way that is useful to Putin.

Debt for investment, and debt for consumption are two entirely different things. Entirely different. The former is a necessity, the latter slow-working suicide. paperraincoat's first example is of the former, the second example of consumption. 
Most government debt tend to be run up through consumptions nowadays. There may be some investment in education and infrastructure, and you could argue that some health care spending could be investment-like in some circumstances, but the bulk of entitlements, welfare, military, bureaucracy etc is just pure consumption.

If you are a long time hodler, who once bought a pile of coins and then sitting on it for an indeterminate time, price fluctuations are not important, no.
But if you earn your income in bitcoin, and/or live off of it, you are still dependent on the bitcoin price, because real-world prices for stuff you need are priced in fiat. Even if you somehow manage to stick to mostly bitcoin-accepting merchants, most of them are still pricing their stuff in fiat (as they kind of have to because *their* suppliers set their prices in fiat), although they accept bitcoin.
If bitcoin is your nest egg, but for your daily life you live off fiat, then price doesn't matter. But if you are more fully immersed in the bitcoin economy, then price does matter. That's a bit of an irony. As long as not the majority of businesses are so completely switched into the bitcoin economy that their prices are set in bitcoin first independently of fiat. Hut the closed loop bitcoin economy is still in the future.

So you mean that central banks could stop their current system of managing their foreign exchange reserves of holding a balanced basket of USD, EUR, CHF, gold etcetera, and just start issuing random HODL notes instead?
The system of foreign exchange reserves exists for a reason. Central banks need them to contain a mix of significant currencies that make up the bulk of international currency markets. The author's point seems to be that at the point when BTC becomes so big it is effectively a significant player in the global forex system, then banks will want to add it to the mix, similar to have they hold gold.
This has nothing to do with replacing fiat with crypto for local use, just managing their asset portfolio.

You've clearly not been to Denmark last 10-15 years. A right wing super nationalist party has 20% (ish) of the votes and are in the government. The rest of the political parties follow the flow to the right. Back in the 70s and 80s, Denmark used to be a haven for free porn, cannabis and it's laid-back socially liberal attitudes in general. It's not at all true anymore, and for example Christiania is under constant attack to be brought in line as the country has moved full speed ahead (or backwards, depending on perspective) into the conservative spectrum.
Also, your ideas that the Scandinavians would not use force is completely backwards. Scandinavia is all about order and preserving the strong central government. There is zero room for not abiding with government, police or other armed representatives. Trying to break off would trigger an instant strong reaction. The police would perhaps have a friendly smile (initially) and calming words for the insurgents, but no expense or resource would be spared to bring the area in line. And with high taxes, zero room for loopholes in tax collection due to an ever present government, and relatively strong economies and public finances, there is no shortage in government resources.

Recurring payments are nice for sellers, I am sure, but that doesn't mean it is good for consumers.
To then answer OP's question, yes I'd rather pay for my subscription with bitcoin than buy my refill cards with cash as I currently do.
I do think fixed fee services are more attractive, as long as their catalogue is big enough . I wouldn't want to pay for every song/play. 
Micro transactions certainly have a big role to play, but only in the musician getting paid by the streaming service, not in the streaming service's relation to the end consumer. Just my 5 cents.

I've always thought of it as a clickbait parody. Making fun of stuff AND at the same time making fun of buzzfeed and all the even lesser crappy clickbait sites.

Except they don't want to give back any money.
They just want to kick start inflation, so that the public debt is deflated away, since that is the easiest and traditional way nations get rid of big debts.
That means helicopter money will only come in a way that makes people more or less forced to spend it quickly.

There is no such thing as a free lunch.
Unless you're Satoshi Nakamoto. Then no rules apply.

Wasn't it Oscar Wilde who said it first though?
