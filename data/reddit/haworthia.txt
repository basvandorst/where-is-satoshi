This looks like legitimate technology but...  


I think [r/pitbull]( is gonna take issue with this :D
@_date: 2014-02-19 06:56:31


It's also a volatile market, and traders have proven rash and reactive in these times of uncertainty, so I'll be curious to see how the market reacts. Surely gox could just feed us more of the same waylaying bs we've already tasted and it could have no affect on the market practically at all, but like I said, I'll be curious to see.

How fitting that btc should be endorsed by the frontman of a band named after a fiat currency denomination...Obviously they don't want their Nickelback...because they'd rather have bitcoin!

Such a great story in the annals of bitcoin lore; speckled with pizza, reddit posts, and lost cold wallets

As an individual with dyslexic tendencies (more while writing than while reading), I'd gladly struggle through non-comic sans fonts thank you very much

Directed to this thread from your user overview ([u/K_meister]( in hopes that you would have some info to this affect...Thanks for sharing and for being the boots on the ground amidst this now rapidly unraveling scandal!!!  
Surely you guys realize how instrumental you are in relaying first hand what is happening on the ground with [what was once] Gox

Ugh. Thanks for posting this, I certainly overlooked it.
@_date: 2014-02-15 20:55:50
Am I missing something?  
This Gox statement does **not** make any indication that they are intending to reenable withdrawals or that we should expect any prospective date for withdrawals to be reenabled. The changes and downtime we're being alerted of are, as the statement says,  


current pause on bitcoin withdrawals.  
@_date: 2014-02-20 01:22:55
I like how you suggest gox's solvency is a decision...there may be some truth to that

@_date: 2014-02-07 20:10:31
Ironically this was almost the same exact analogy they used to justify "pausing" withdrawals in response to the thread posting their announcement
@_date: 2014-02-20 14:27:13
Right now they're obviously doing a stellar job of minimizing death threats!

@_date: 2014-03-08 05:31:21
That's wherein the ironic hilarity of bitcoin's mainstream media coverage  lies: Whilst bitcoin may exist in a virtual environment, hash cryptography may be one of the most indisputable forms of proof in the existence of man. It's the smoking gun; the ultimate paper trail. And how does it get covered by the media? Patchwork articles drawn from the most vague, speculative heresy bullshit! They're up against a community that employs pools of computers working at their maximum processing capabilities to irrefutably verify the authenticity of every last micropayment and they disseminate information with out hardly a single shred of evidence? 
As an audience we should be considered the ultimate fact checkers of the modern age and it's downright insulting.

Isn't it an amazing feeling to have your consciousness so consumed by a technology? To watch such massive change happening right in front of you? I can relate to the sensation of humility whilst standing in front of such a grand innovation and wondering how I may contribute (my girlfriend would be the first to attest to, and occasionally complain about, the amount of time i devote to learning and researching). I salute your curiosity and enthusiasm, and no matter how great or small your contribution, don't forget that you're here, you're making a difference, and you're not alone.

Seriously...If I had a satoshi for every headline that came up on the ticker since yesterday's Gox statement that read something along the lines of, "Glitch in bitcoin; bitcoin is fundamentally flawed; bitcoin broken; etc, etc, etc."
@_date: 2014-02-05 02:07:48
Is that what that means? They arrested Shrem at the airport.

Completely justifying the QR code. They're there representing the entire bitcoin community and part of that meant biting a $1400 bullet for all of us.
@_date: 2014-02-11 21:50:57
The first thing I noticed was how transparent and explanative their statement was compared to the infinitely vague bullshit statement Gox released yesterday.  Also can I just comment on what a wild fucking ride the bitcoin "situation" has developed into as of late? Something new every day.  Hold onto your hats people!
@_date: 2014-02-12 17:51:42
Because of course fiat is easily divisible, transportable, secure, and can't be faked :D

Sort of loling that this is getting up voted considering r/bitcoin usually brings out the pitchforks at any mention of putting money into gox...[brass balls]( tho I suppose! I hope for your (and my) sake money starts flowing out of gox at some point down the road!

Their complete ignorance to the question of Gox's solvency is the highest insult to the btc community and its founding principles of transparency
