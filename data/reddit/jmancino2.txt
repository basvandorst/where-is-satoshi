I got mine today, just wanted to update that it finally arrived. I don't have time to mess with it now but it is here! :)

I understand the situation, I was unhappy with the tone of the update itself. Bad business to pass blame along, especially after so many delays in the first place. They did offer a refund but considering I backed them early I want the cheaper unit still. Worst part is I wanted to buy a second but you can't have faith in the company until they deliver. I guess I will hope for the best too.

Yes, it is good to know what is up. They will likely eventually make it right. The cultural thing I believe for sure. You forget sometimes everyone is not able to just send a letter. Some more than others. Sad that they will lose sales from this, I'm sure there will be knockoffs soon enough that it is out in the wild. Nobody will care about quality when you can't run a business.

Horrible update, an apology would go a long way, but let's blame everyone else. Send out 120 units of anything in to the wind with no recourse...that is, if they were ever sent at all. Then, as a thank you to the backers - you can go buy them someplace else... What a joke.

About 80 of us got an update where "oh by the way they went poof not sorry" ...your customs is bad! Poor shipping logistics to everywhere else is certainly their fault and they can apologize for that. I buy stuff from overseas all the time and my tyrannical customs does not stop it when done properly. Like someone also said, it would also be nice to have any proof that anything was sent in the first place. They took our shipping money in June 2015, so they had plenty of time to not screw up the delivery. Just is what it is at this point. I blew off my steam, and will just continue to wait.

If you have the passcode you should be able to restore from that. Not familiar with multibit but I am sure there are instructions. Good luck! *goes to make some backups*

Installed on a laptop, cool. Setup some stuff, made some changes. Realized it would be nicer on a VPS. No import export functions. Documentation is for old versions, lacking for new. Huge pain in the ass to move the setup. Figured a lot of it out, decided to start from scratch anyway. Needs to be easier for an average joe, I'm mildly technical and it was a pain. Has potential but who wants to use something that is a hassle to backup and restore or move. I'm keeping an eye on it though, I do like the idea.
