Agreed. Doing the best we can.

No, it is not a scam. The movie is super close to being finished with post-production. We have entered into some top-tier film festivals, and we are waiting to hear back. (This is Theron typing.) I'm one of the Kickstarter team and one of the producers. We have been having potential distribution partners preview the film over the last four weeks. Nothing to announce yet on that front.  Our composer is working on the last couple of tracks too. 
The parts that remain to be finished are some color correction and some sound design. Not a dime of the funds donated were spent on Austin and Beccy's honeymoon or wedding. For that matter, 100% of the Kickstarter donations have gone to the film makers, the Kickstarter fees and Amazon processing fees and the rewards.
The company we hired to shoot, direct and edit the film, The Good Line took a lot longer in post-production than we anticipated. This is their first feature, and it is a much bigger job than they thought it would be. Our budget couldn't buy all of their time, so they had to work on it in and around all of their other work and clients. 
We are hopeful that we can push this film out there in the first quarter of next year. In the event we are unable to secure distribution, we have a plan to market the film directly.

Keep in mind, The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin started production more than a year before we did, and it just released last month. Filmmaking and distribution is a byzantine process - one that we, admittedly, didn't fully understand when we went into this. See my response to OP for a more in depth update.

I think the primary reason that he is saying that it will add 4 cents attributable to bitcoin is because I believe about 80% of bitcoin sales are brand new customers - customers Overstock otherwise would not have had. This means that all of the profit from those sales, not just the saved transaction fees could be attributable to bitcoin acceptance.

Nope. None of the donations were used for the wedding or the honeymoon. Austin and Beccy used their own money.

We are really looking forward to this film. Dealing with the challenges of post-production and distribution ourselves for the Life On Bitcoin film, we are pulling for the success of The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin.

Excellent suggestions.

Thank you! Glad you haven't forgotten us. As long as it took, that was certainly a risk. :)

Thank you for spreading the word! You are right, it is more of a historical look, especially for the community. However, when you look at the average person, a full half in the United States have still never even heard about bitcoin and we all know that the userbase is globally small, but growing. The movie and other movies like The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin and Bitcoin: The End of Money As We Know It  will be relevant for years to come.

Hi, Theron here with the team. I found your donation. I'm sending you an email now.
