the value of bitcoin is not derived from the protocol , its derived by supply and demand , so its commodity money.

Keep digging in the rabbit hole :)
@_date: 2013-07-20 19:24:38
so in your opinion ,  real state  or dot.com bubble is not caused by malinvestments?
@_date: 2013-07-20 11:50:12
Unless a black swan appears ( eurozone crash and such)

Cyprus was a black swan .
@_date: 2013-07-28 20:43:17
In my opinion , we are about 500k  to 1 million bitcoin users world wide at 95-100$ each bitcoin now , if the user base grows to 11 million , the price will grow exponentially much more than  200$/BTC.

Search about Austrian economic money theory and economic circle , is mind-blowing.

Already read it , but its a matter of  interpretation of the term speculation .
@_date: 2013-10-08 14:14:35
What about fiat invested in bitcoin then invested in asicminer ?
@_date: 2013-07-20 17:29:57
What I mean is , yes printing money makes you feel richer and then makes you spend more because you have more dollars , businessman hires more people cuz higher demand , but this is short term .
In the long term it creates malinvestments , bubbles and then crisis so  we end at the same start point or much worse.
Sorry but my english is not very good to explain in more detail my point of view so I will share this video of a economics PhD from Spain explaining this point: 
It´s a quite long , but I think you will find it very interesting .
@_date: 2013-07-20 18:32:57
Yes , now , in short term , but in long term part of that money ends in consumption market , if production haven't increased at the same rate or more than money supply it will cause inflation or hyperinflation depending the difference between them.
@_date: 2013-08-28 18:21:00
sold out lol.
@_date: 2013-11-18 01:43:19
next level , learn about austrian school of economics.

Make a blockchain.info wallet , then save the seed master key .
@_date: 2013-07-20 16:40:10
False , if you have 10 dollars and the other guy has 10 breads , you can buy 1 bread for 1 dollar.
But , if you print 10 dollars more having 20 dollars and the other guy keeps having 10 breads , each  one will cost 2 dollar .
So by having more dollars created from nothing , don´t makes you richer in real terms.

What bubble?
@_date: 2013-07-20 12:50:20
Who knows , the PIIGS are dead , they can´t pay back the debt , the only solution will be a bail-in or mass print of money causing hyperinflation .
I live in Spain and it´s becoming hell.
@_date: 2013-07-20 19:58:33
In my opinion , every investment  is by definition  speculation , buy low , sell high with or without processing or additional work .
Real state bubble not only incresed price of assets but also a lot of new construction companys due increasing demand and rising prices , creating a whole bubble of new unsustainable companys in long term , in other words , malinvestments.

They are precius metal hoarders
@_date: 2013-07-20 17:34:56
Near zero interest is free money for banks , they borrow at 0.25% and buy sovereign debt with 4% rate or such , it´s not literally printing but it acts like the same .
@_date: 2013-07-18 22:58:03
and capital controls for overseas accounts , time to bail in?
@_date: 2013-07-20 20:12:10
But you are speculating that those widgets you make will be sold for a price higher than the cost in order to gain profits on your investment .
So it fits in the definition of speculation.
@_date: 2013-07-20 16:00:52
False ,  they are indeed printing money  ( 0.25% interest rate ECB ) but the problem still persist , if money printing solves the problem , lets print trillions for everyone , it don´t make any sense .
@_date: 2013-03-31 15:34:12
use electrum , then save the seed masterkey  , its the same as going to blockain.ifo
