Yeah because bitcoins came rushing back after the last crash, except they didn't.
@_date: 2013-05-17 17:57:12
SR doesn't drive enough of the market and it's only gotten harder to obtain BTC in the last week.  Honestly I can't put any weight on a prediction involving SR, if Bitcoin is going to grow further SR is going to mean less and less as a percentage of the market.
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:26:06
Nothing wrong with speculation either.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:39:47
No, I've been doing this for 2-3 years now.  Can you explain it, or are you just going to give me the hivemind line?
@_date: 2013-05-13 17:52:27
This is pretty much it.  What's better about bitcoin than cash for these types of businesses?

Also "its just a matter of time before it hits $10k/bitcoin" over and over and over.

Huge fail on reading comprehension.  One of the largest =/= the largest.

That isn't the whole point for most people and unless PayPal suddenly becomes the only way to use BTCs then no, no change in the status quo.
@_date: 2013-05-17 20:55:45
Its an old study but: 
For the sake of arguement lets double that, is $4 million a month in sales really enough to power the bitcoin market?  That's a small business-sized number.

Value is determined by how BTC can be spent, not by speculation.  Speculation determines price.  It should recover, probably over the course of nine months, like last time.
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:32:39
Not kill, just drop the price a lot is all.  It has happened before and everything was fine, it's just happening faster this time so I find it much more interesting. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:52:27
Right, but you have to have evidence to make an informed decision either way.  "Well it keeps going up" is not a good enough reason to assume it is going to keep going up.  We don't have much substantive proof either way, that's the current issue.
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:05:22
Uh, 10 times is a lot of leverage...  The blood has just hit the street, you don't know how much more is coming.

Sounds good for your mental health.  Or you're a psycho.

Isn't that what's been going on here at for 1-2 months now?
@_date: 2013-07-01 22:13:25
In the 2-3 years I've been doing this the length of periods where Bitcoin's price has been pretty stable have been much longer than periods of heavy volatility. 
@_date: 2013-05-02 19:39:33


Now-a-days?  It's been like a month.
@_date: 2013-05-02 19:40:31
Its been literally a month.  It sat a $12 for what, a year?  More?  No one has a clue what "the new normal" is.
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:23:21
Not sure how the price is so high honestly.  There has been at least 10 times more being sold than bought.  I keep seeing 100, 700, etc. btc sales, maybe 10 or so being bought at a time.
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:25:41
Bigger drop, but not instantly based on a couple news articles.  It did happen quickly, but the runup also happened quickly.  This time there was no bubble to pop.
@_date: 2013-04-05 17:59:00
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:53:02
Uh, yeah.... Or BTC has been under $15 for the vast majority of SR's existence.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:44:33
Why is that?
@_date: 2013-05-17 17:58:26
Got a source for that?
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:30:44
It's cratering, tickers are not believable at this time.

15% is a suburban tip, 20% is the standard in cities.

Libtard, really?
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:01:36
20+% Drop in 2 hours is a small fluctuation?  Hardly an indicator of stability.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:20:54
I doubt it has seen much increase at all over it's normal growth rate, if even that.  How can I buy anything with these kind of price changes? 
@_date: 2013-04-04 17:04:23
Tweets work better for me.
@_date: 2013-10-02 17:28:22
How is it strong enough?  Probably the main place people actually spend bitcoins went down.  Speculation is all well and good, except when you can't do anything with it.  It's getting crushed right now.
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:06:39
I've been doing this for three years now, I've never seen a such fluctuation in a two hour timespan.

Mitigate doesn't mean cancelled out, it means the impact was lessened.  Do you think MtGox hasn't mitigated some of the impact of this ddos?

Yes, catch the falling knife.

It shouldn't, what was he going to do at $2?  Sell to recoup 6% of his investment?
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:56:33
Good question.  I know that while the foreclosure crisis was at its peak a few years ago they were using aerial views for tracking negligent property owners who were creating a public health nuisance with unkempt pools.  But then if aerial surveillance was totally on the level why would people be upset about drones?
@_date: 2013-10-02 17:59:58
50% lost value because of one event is a fuckton. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 00:02:54
Wat?  The bid doesn't matter, only the selling price matters.
