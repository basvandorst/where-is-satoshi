Had the same thing happen to Coinbase about a year ago. Nearly got my account stolen before I realized what was going on.

Any idea what channels I should go through to do that? I doubt they would do anything since its down now...

Many towns in Maine have higher property taxes than towns in NH.

Again, it's not a NH problem. My NH property tax is much less than many towns in surrounding states. If you average the whole state against averages of others, yes it may be might higher. If high property tax is a problem for you... don't buy a house in a town with high property tax, regardless of state.

Just moved to NH, I disagree about Maine being cheeper. What you pay in taxes is highly dependent on the town you're in. My property taxes are pretty cheap compared to areas in VT or Maine plus it's offset by saved income tax to the point it's close to zero. Other towns can be very expensive though

\~$19.5 per thousand. I'm mid state, couple minutes to walmart and less than an hour to concord so the're plenty around, not on the boonies or anything. I was specifically looking at this map: [ , anything orange is about or above what i'm paying and there is plenty of it. There's also cheaper towns like moultonborough nh, $9 per thousand. If you're looking down at concord, yes it's very high but I chose not to move to those areas.
My point being you can't make a blanket statement like NH has unreasonably high property taxes, it's retaliative and depends. For those like me who have a decent steady income, it's a pretty good deal, saved quite a lot moving here.

Just got this and came here, obviously reported as phishing. Anyone know where they got the email addresses from?

I DO use mine for coinbase, seems like they may have gotten their hands on multiple DB's
