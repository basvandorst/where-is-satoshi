If money was backed by gold yea(ie when people as gold in lock boxes banks and safes... if people don’t use bitcoin over say US dollar bill what’s the real point beside it being a way to make money in the form of a currency you’ll actually use

It’s actually better if your employer makes you pay taxes out of it anyways

Your right but Most people are chasing money through crypto...people don’t want to actually use bitcoin and other coins they want the price to go up so they make money which to imo is why I’m afraid to jump in with both feet ... we need people to want to use it over their countries current currency

Isn’t the fear of missing out the reason most people bought it?Weather for a good investment or actually use the crypto currency( doubt it)people buy it when I think they might miss out
