Thanks for your response.
So from my understanding from reading your post, features 1 through 5 will indeed be added? Do you by chance have an ETA like coming spring, summer, fall? of this year?

This is not a fake post.

That would be prefect, but do you have an ETA

Thinking about it, I still think the print receive QR code/address window would still be beneficial. If you can also please add this feature, it would be very much appreciated.

I really hope it makes it in. It is a simply feature after all.
@_date: 2017-02-17 11:35:56
Still waiting on that followup.

I want to use Digital Bitbox as my primary wallet, but without this feature it simply wont be possible.

Yes, but the CoolWallet has the NFC charger so it could be plugged into the PC and a simple tap of the hard card could enable the U2F

Can you followup with me via email on how the export/print feature would work? *PDF export (that directly opens in the OSes PDF viewer*
@_date: 2017-02-20 20:03:53
No they didn't unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-02-18 23:45:17
How do you add it? is a thousand dollars required?

Thanks for participating.
1. The first idea you mention is simply just a work around but there should be an option in the client by default. It shouldn't be that hard to add.
2. I completely agree with you on this, I have faced this issue many times and I am very glad you brought it up. I don't know how many times this has happened to me. Hopefully the developer will add this feature.
