Intentionally?  I can purchase company stock with my 401k funds as an option but I can't for the life of me think why I would want to do that.

Maybe they're only going to fine him 5 weeks' income.

His mom said in [this interview]( that he's not being indicted for the murder for hire stuff.

This is actually one of the smaller bowl games, but the exposure is great because the average football fan probably still has no clue what bitcoin is.  I'm really glad they're using bitcoin for the name rights instead of bitpay.

Whataboutism isn't nearly as convincing an argument as you think for someone who isn't already inclined to agree with you.
"Why does Bitcoin have value?" Is a very good question and one I'd encourage anyone interested in crypto to explore and try to understand for themselves, and will naturally lead to questioning the true value of anything else.  Answering a question with a question and trying to jump straight to derailing someone's concept of 'value' comes off as dismissive of the question though.

Is there anything preventing somebody from just putting up a btc qr code in their profile to accept tips and donations like that?  Reddcoin has had a twitch not integration for a while but hardly anybody used it.  I just don't understand why this needs to be integrated.

I'm mostly uninformed of Lightning here, why is this brave?

Same.  Bit instant email option.  That either isn't available now or the site is down when I check.  Money gram at the only location within 30 miles of me takes forever(cvs  with a money gram phone and cashiers who struggle through the process when you have to check out with them).
I signed up with coin base but now every time I try to buy coins it tells me they reached their max buy limit for the day.
Closest local bit coin trader on localbitcoins is is 50 miles away.

First time I bought bitcoins at CVS was a pain.  They had a moneygram phone and it sat right smack between the 2 touchscreen photo stations, both occupied by adults who had no clue what they were doing, so i just wandered around for a bit.
Then as soon as they left I started using the phone, somebody else came in and starting using the photo station beside me, making it uncomfortably close.  I spend the entire process trying not to stare or make it look like i'm staring at them or their pictures because I'm on the phone waiting for prompts and there is nothing else to look at.
When I finally go to check out the woman at the 1 register has no clue how to process my moneygram transaction, so she stumbles through it for almost 10 minutes while no fewer than 8 people line up behind me.
Thank god for coinbase.

Bitcoins too volatile, invest in drugs!

never heard of ace cash express, though it wouldn't surprise me if there were some around.  When I searched for moneygram locations the only one within half an hour of me was a CVS.

Its still way too difficult to buy bitcoins.
