This program needs help:

Get you tossed in jail for tax avoidance , money laundering or other trumped up charges 
@_date: 2013-05-28 17:02:39
It's under attack,  but not the way you described.
I think seizing funds from Mt.Gox , shutting down OKpay's Bitcoin processing and closing Liberity down are how it's done..  they aren't hacking Bitcoin,  they are just making it as hard as possible to change it to other currencies.
@_date: 2013-05-28 18:26:39
No one is going to upload their bank account to a p2p system.  Bitcoin was designed for that,  your bank account isn't.
@_date: 2013-04-22 01:12:09
It's approved but not going anywhere unless a miracle happens :(
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:34:32
sure just send me the urls of the api.. must be in a clear text format.
Example : 
Output :  
With 50 being the spot price.

I was told to treat Bitcoins the same way you would treat Gold Coins, Silver Coins,  Platinum Coins and Palladium Coins.

awesome!  :)   add  
@_date: 2013-03-29 20:10:12
Honestly,  we have us to thank,  but indirectly we have FinCEN.. basically the guidelines published cleared the way for huge investments in Bitcoin.  Prior to this no one knew if you invested in a Bitcoin Project if it would be legal or not,  now it's clear that it is.
@_date: 2013-04-01 18:51:03
That is freaking funny :)
@_date: 2013-04-27 16:28:32
This might help you,  I keep track of all the spot prices of Gold, Silver, Bitcoin, Platinum, Palladium and Oil.    Regardless of what you purchase (I like bitcoins and silver)  I would think you need to know the exact real time price of what they are..  (  )
@_date: 2013-05-20 16:41:48
No it didn't affect only those people...  it affected everyone.   Put it this way,  Google obtains urls not only by links, but also by reading usage on Google Chrome, Google Voice, Gmail, Google Talk... everything Google touches is fair game to the company, and fair game to their index.  People used to e-mail their "secret" url to themselves via Gmail... at that moment it's fair game.  They bookmarked it via Chrome and chances are it was uploaded to the cloud, and became fair game...   the list goes on.
@_date: 2013-05-24 19:53:13

that's doable as well...   I could easily have 1000 display and update options,  my bigger concern however is how to code for it in the first place.   I don't even know where to start.

if you're an iOS developer, then contact me about it because I might need help.  I'll be the bigger one here and if it's funded I might need a consultant on it's design.

You got to remember at the time bitcoin was a handful of machines mining on CPU's ...  blocks were easy to solve...  and about 100 people total were playing with them...

"Sounds more like considering an idea! "    No shit Sherlock..  the fact that the UK government is laying out plans for a bitcoin exchange is earth shattering.
@_date: 2013-05-14 14:30:02
It's easy to read it that way...  BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS.    The UK government is considering / planning for a regulated bitcoin exchange.   This is huge.

possible,  I started ounce.me because initially I was (and still am) a Silver Guy,  hence I just made that app to personally keep track of Silver...  Bitcoins and stuff peaked my interest about 2 years ago... and I added them...    I don't think it's gonna drop like what you are saying in short order...  it might take months.. if not longer.

yep :)   I think the whole bitcoin community needs to get behind this one.. it will pave the way for everyone to get funding on kickstarter.

If Western Union were to enter the bitcoin business, there is only one real way they could,  and that would to be an exchange.   they most likely would dominate in that with thousands of physical locations all selling bitcoins.

I am not disagreeing with you.   I am just pointing out the fact that this is not bad news..  put it this way.. let's say that we have 10 billion invested in this fund...  he's going to have to come up with a way to increase the value of his portfolio of bitcoins to 10 billion...  if that means buying every freaking bitcoin on earth to make that happen then so be it.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:27:20
No they can't ...    why is it that they purchased millions of dollars worth of bitcoins and the second that happens bitcoin crashes....  LOL  Zuckerberg was there first and sold just to piss them off again.

No one is going to tip me for this... What Max said Regarding "possible workaround of the the FinCEN problem"   That's complete opposite of what happens.   The second you peg Bitcoins to US dollars is the exact second people are violating every freaking law you can think of because now miners are not mining bitcoins,  they are printing dollars..   Mining bitcoins is one thing,  mining US dollar equivalents is something else.

The answer is : Is the webapp in the app store where everyone looks for apps?  The answer is no, which is the problem, and also  Which is what the whole problem is with the Apple Ecosystem... that being stated if you don't want to support it (and the overall bitcoin community seeking funding for projects on Kickstarter) then don't back it.

You can get accurate spot prices on  (it uses a weighted average of multiple exchanges).   IE: it's not tied to Mt.Gox exclusively.  However that just displays price.. it's not an exchange.
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:13:24
web :    
android :  
uses aggregate data from multiple exchanges and delivers accurate price..  when Mt.Gox goes down for example you still get accurate pricing.
Also includes commodities like Gold, Silver and some interesting bitcoin metric,  as well as a news feed for all the breaking bitcoin news (and a second line for world headlines) ..  people tend to stare at it for hours on end as it updates in virtual real time.

Look this is what it means... not to CampBX .. but to all of us..  it's multiple fold.   First being that CampBX is one of the advertisers on  .. what it tells me is that CampBX isn't a fly by night organization.  It's in there for the long haul , or at least that's the intent.  Which means I can count of them not being shut down for lack of not trying to be compliant.   What it means to you is that there are SOME bitcoin companies that are actually trying to fit into the current crazy system.   Which is just one step closer for bitcoin to be legitimate.
@_date: 2013-04-15 14:44:27
That's what I was thinking... actually I was thinking that people were flocking to bitcoin at the expense of Gold...

I really do like it.   I strongly urge you to add the mining reward line item on   --  it adds the spot price of bitcoin times the amount awarded plus fees and tells you exactly what the most recent block was worth in dollars.    There's an RSS feed / api at the bottom

@_date: 2013-04-19 18:19:45
That's most likely true,  but that's unsustainable for any pool as fees start to become more and more important as the reward drops over the years.

in 2010 a guy bought a pizza dinner for 10,000 bitcoins,  that pizza is now worth more than a million dollars.
It's one expensive dinner,  it was also the first purchase of a real world item for bitcoins.   It basically started the whole thing.   Lazzo (the guy that bought it) did as much for Bitcoin as Satoshi.  At the time the purchase was worth about 25 dollars.

I'd take a second and third mortgage on my home to buy them and set them up all though the Philadelphia area (where I currently reside),  every area where there is substantial foot traffic, right next to the ATM machines, so people can withdrawl and deposit without taking a step.   However I suspect that those machines will be forceably removed by FinCEN within 15 minutes of being installed.   I need a legal guidance from the relevent authorities before I start taking out loans to buy these things.

This depends on a few factors.
1 - How close to retirement are they?  Some people have their live completely balanced out and any types of "gamble' might cause some serious hardships for someone on fixed income.
2 - What is their capital position?  If they have tons of disposable income then got for it.

I thought the bitcoin community would be interested in seeing bitcoin actually growing as an economy this was just a good example.  Based on the down votes it appears that bitcoin companies doing business with each other aren't very much appreciated in the community.   Which is exactly opposite of what I thought would be good

I'm an idiot because I found your clients Bitcoins published on Google?  You took people's bitcoins got them stolen with your "security".   You NEVER blocked the urls in Google Webmaster tools,  until I had to send step by step screenshots to you so you could learn how to do it.  The fact that anyone sent coins to you is scary.     Now I actually feel better that I exposed what you were doing.   Because even after you lost your clients coins,  you have the guts to call me an idiot.   How do you sleep with yourself at night knowing you had your clients coins stolen?  You sir are a jerk.     You have no business taking your clients coins.

Big Company "A" = Has a 8% margin on the product they sell.
Big Company "A" = Sells their product for roughly what bitcoins are worth at that moment in USD.
Big Company "A" = Goes to Mt.Gox (or wherever) and sells their coins,  however the price swing during those few hours went from 130 dollars to 110 dollars.
Big Company "A" refused to accept bitcoins anymore.
Now the flip side is possible as well,  where they make a profit...  overall they might have a decent increase for the year,  but these companies report every 90 days their earnings...  so if they were selling their products at Bitcoin's peak a month ago, now they are reporting a loss this quarter ..  ask any CEO if that looks good..  'we lost our asses on bitcoins' is what he'd put on the report.

I didn't know the power company allows for payment in Bitcoin to power those rigs.  And if they have a second job to pay for the power,  it's automatically factored into the increase of $572,004.00 ...  The number is 100% accurate.   If someone pays the electric bill to pay for the mining rig with his job at Walmart as compared to selling his coins to do it, it's counted towards the $572,004.00 ---  now $579,600.00

I hope it's 1994 again .   I'll tell you what..  I started my first job in the middle of the .com boom.  VC's were pouring money into internet startups.  Many of them of course failed 1/2 a decade later..  but the end result is not all of them did.  Amazon.Com still exists,  Ebay still exists,  much of the infrastructure that bitcoin lives on was started during that boom time.    If this becomes something similar to that..  we might change the world just like what happened in the 1990's is what spawned Bitcoin (and the whole internet) today.   20 years from now when the primary way to transfer money is via bitcoin you'll look back at this time and say how much was accomplished.   Take it from me,  I saw the whole thing happen once...  and I am seeing the exact same thing happening now.

What’s with all the bitcoin shutdowns?
Over the past few days we have heard about accounts being seized at Mt.Gox , OkPay shutting down Bitcoin Services, Liberty Reserve being seized and a whole host of operations being shut down right and left that have anything to do with the words ‘bitcoin’ and ‘exchange’.
In the same breath we’re hearing Paypal wants to get involved in Bitcoin as well as Western Union and a host of traditional financial companies.
What’s the deal?
Well, in a nutshell bitcoin is going to be ‘allowed to succeed’ but you’re not the one that’s allowed to succeed with it. Don’t bother opening an exchange today, and if you own one you should seriously be looking over your back as regulators are gunning for you.
You’re going to hear a ton more of account seizures and bitcoin to fiat companies shut down until a few months from now you’ll get this press release saying that Paypal is now accepting Bitcoin (with a zero refund policy and them in the middle). In other words you’ll send your bitcoins to Paypal, paypal then charges the client and forwards the bitcoins to the client. The client will have no charge back option. Of course they get their cut both ways in the process. Roughly the same terms come from Western Union and other established companies.
In other words, if you are an already established player (such as a bank, paypal or western union type firm) regulators are stalling for you to get your ducks in a row. When the slate is clean, the big firms can come in a clean house.
You think I am kidding? In 6 months check the status of bitcoin, you’ll see a few more currently operating exchanges shut down and a new host of “big firms” taking over the entire process.
I wouldn’t want to be Mt.Gox right now.

I think you misunderstood the post.  Let's assume this simple picture.
year 1 ||
Bitcoins trade at 10 dollars ,  10 people use them , 10 bitcoins in existance -  total market size -  100 dollars.
year 2 ||
Bitcoins trade at 10 dollars,  15 people use them,  15 bitcoins in existance - total market size 150 dollars.
The price of bitcoin didn't move at all,  but the overall size of the bitcoin economy did by a huge percentage.

You're not trolling.  though I suspect you'll (and me by replying to this) will get downvoted.   I've had bitcoin listed as a payment option on  for several months now.  No one has taken that option though they get a 15% discount for doing such.  I have dozens of clients and their billables could be substantial (thousands of dollars a month)  by default they could save a considerable sum,  but none have opted for it.

I recently included that metric because it appears to be useful for miners in general and also to others for general curiosity.   Now of course if a "mining group" earns that reward on that solved block then generally that exactly amount is dispersed among all in that group based on whatever their terms are,  but if you are a sole miner with some sort of massive infrastructure,  each time you solve a block you will know in real time exactly what it's worth converted to other currency.

Similar to SLV or other ETF's .    That's how ETF's work.   You want to put your money into Bitcoin pre-tax though your 401k?  You are going to have to do it this way.    
See if the total number (dollar figure) invested exceed the x number of bitcoins in their portfolio, then they are legally binded to increase the number of bitcoins they have.   Let's say that the Wikivii have 1 bitcoin and the market rate for a bitcoin is 100 dollars.  They have 400 dollars invested in their ETF from other people.   They are now legally required to buy 3 more bitcoins.  So that what's invested equals the assets they own.

I think you need might be counting the same coins thousands of times.   Traders by definition buy then sell and buy and sell and buy and sell.    Some hard-core trader might buy and sell 10 bit coins all day long and ended the day it looks like 5000 coins traded but in reality it was just bought and sold bought and sold the same coins
You could have two guys with 100 bitcoins and $1000 each and by the end of the day it looks like A hundred thousand coins traded

It will launch.   You have 2 reasons why.
1 - this means that large amounts of money coming into bitcoin will be via existing system traceable fiat currency.   So this will help control large parts of it for know your customer issue.
2 -  As much as the goverment doesn't like bitcoin,  it likes jobs more so there are people to tax.  Let's face it, Bitcoin could be the next thing on par with the 1980's computer,  the 1990's internet and the 2000's mobile devices.  As far as they are concerned they don't care if you trade in bitcoins all day long as long as you pay your taxes in dollars based on the profit you made in bitcoin.

There are very view bitcoin projects that get actually funded or succeed on Kickstarter.   I had the first one ever approved and listed on Kickstarter,  and it went down in utter failure with only a fraction of funding.     Even the Wikivoss twins for all their hoopla surrounding Bitcoin refused to fund it.. and it was just a ticker for IOS nothing more with a funding goal for 5k.   The problem is that we don't have a community.   This is officially the very first kickstarter bitcoin project.   Notice how the community never helped?

The Census.Gov clock updates in real time based on the most recent census (2010) and gives the exact projected population based on that for this exact moment.  Of course since censuses are taken every 10 years,  it becomes more inaccurate as we get closer to the 2020 , but then it resets with the new data.
