Not a surprise, more news like this will follow if LN doesn’t come through, Altcoin will surpass Btc and eventually Btc will die when no merchant will accept it. Hope LN comes through.
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:20:14
Impressive really. Way to go!
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:20:25
I don’t use Btc anymore, it’s more like a store value now for me at this rate, I use Ltc for day to day transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:00:26
I can see my bch.
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:29:31
What does it mean ? I don't understand.
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:24:40
Waitttt it's gonna dip more.
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:25:31
Trust me, I'm just buying coins, I don't understand those shit 1Mb 8Mb, doesn't matter to me.
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:22:04
It's changed so much.
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:05:53
Link bank so there won't be fees, with card you'll be charged fees even wit F&amp;F.
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:05:42
What's that app?
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:24:19
Is this the dip? Waiting to dip below 4000
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:15:16
RemindMe! 15 days "btc guy"
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:33:52
I was gonna get a hardware wallet in a few weeks, wanted to go with Trezor but after seeing this, I'm gonna go with Ledger.
@_date: 2017-08-19 00:32:12
So do you mean they still sell to others ?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:16:50
I know how cryptocurrency cuts out the middle man, what I'm talking about is the ease of use in it for daily transaction. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:23:04
Yes I did get the point that's why I replied that I understand it cuts out the middle man like banks to save your money.
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:20:42
Had to pay to someone in bitcoin, but I bought a lot more like that every day $6-10-20 between those numbers.
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:45:14
You don't seem to get the point here, the point here is can you use it as a replacement for credit cards? No you can't, not yet and the problem is because of high fees and confirmation time, that is why people are reluctant to accept payment with BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-19 01:45:44
Is there a source for that ? I don't know why they ever stopped selling bitcoins, it was really convenient to buy with them.
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:16:50
I'm sure $580, cuz people wants to buy a lot more with that price, no ones interested in august ��
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:25:43
It's changed very much.
@_date: 2017-08-16 06:22:46
The fees are too much, ethereum is much better for confirmation for me.
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:28:06
Should have bought last year when it was like $650 lol, I have nth rn.
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:06:01
Am I? I can deposit my money in the bank and it shows up in my card and I can use it instantly ? Where's the wait ? I can send money to my friends and they get it instantly with 0 fees.
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:39:38
Thanks, same boat.
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:38:25
I bought at $4300 and $4900 I'm dead.

@_date: 2017-10-31 18:22:09
Yeah, I guess I'll use alt coin for day-to-day transaction and only hold btc from now on then, and I get downvotes for complaining about fees here. just wow.
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:25:20
[should have bought more ]( 
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:20:18
Then how will it replace fiat one day?
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:45:20
0.01 fees that's not so true.
@_date: 2017-07-05 08:13:04
Myanmar sucks, internet there is like 60kb/sec and they call it fiber on top of that it costs $40 a month installation is like $1000.
@_date: 2017-06-01 23:48:16
Thanks ��
@_date: 2017-06-01 23:41:34
I see, I have no problem getting verified, so Coinbase would be better for me ?
