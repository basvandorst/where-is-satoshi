\&gt;   the Bitcoin software has various heuristics to detect malicious behavior and will ban/ignore peers that send messages that waste bandwidth without providing data. 
Could you point out where in the code it actually does this?

@_date: 2017-09-13 13:27:52
Haven't checked the charts in a like a week... can u give a very quick explanation why the dips all across the board?
@_date: 2018-02-25 03:55:29
So whats going to happen here? Are countries going to make their own and ban Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-02-25 18:53:16


Yeah public use will be banned; but users can still trade individually, if willing to take that risk.


It's just a kneejerk reaction due to Venezuela making a coin, then Iran is talking about one... it seems if every country starts making one there will be more incentive to ban Bitcoin.
Countries will sign agreements in where users can seamlessly exchange currencies thru their respective country based blockchain.
Edit: Yeah I see it now, a centralized blockchain is basically a database that can be altered by the controller.. it's pointless
@_date: 2017-09-14 01:54:07
Wow... based off of my year and half experience in crypto this should be nothing.
@_date: 2019-09-06 05:17:13
Is it possible to create a transaction using watch only on electrum? Or do you have to do it thru command line?
@_date: 2019-09-05 14:57:11
Does the updated electrum app protect against this?
@_date: 2019-09-05 11:52:11
So how does one prevent this? I still have the old electrum app on my desktop. Do I just go to electrum.org and download the new app?

oh so if you send the same amount to your self that didn't get sent in the first place, you will get back that same amount but you still have to pay another transaction fee to the miners?

What is the difference between running a node on a raspberry pi compared to running a node on a full fledged desktop, in relation to the effect it has on supporting the bitcoin infrastructure?

Nice thanks. 
What about for other transactions I make hereafter? Is their a certain amount that I should include in order to make the transactions confirm faster?
@_date: 2017-05-13 17:48:41

So u connect the pi to an ssd to store blockchain? (Kind of a noob so I may not know what I'm talking about)
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:25:35
Price will go down, then up after initial confusion.
If their is a chain split, there will be two coins. One coin in the chain were on right now, another coin on segwit chain which will become the new "main" chain. Your coin will be on segwit chain due to electrons support for it.
@_date: 2017-05-29 21:37:03
The technology is unstoppable but not necessarily bitcoin
@_date: 2017-05-13 22:36:06
Haha nice. Yeah I just watched a bloomberg video clip about act 20 on youtube, and it says you gotta provide services off the island. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 18:18:37
It will go down from here until August 1, then it will go back up.
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:49:49
it begins...
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:03:37
Only use bitcoin for important transactions, use ur credit card or PayPal for everything else.
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:09:29
I just read that SegWit increases the blocksize allowing the top miners to keep even more control mining... am i wrong?
@_date: 2017-05-13 23:41:28
What determines how many inputs it takes?
Is it based on how many different receiving addresses that I've used?
@_date: 2017-05-19 07:51:23
Wait y did they charge U? What did u try to Do?
U sent money to the account and they just took it?
@_date: 2017-05-11 17:53:44
I dont think anyone knows for sure. You could literally flip a coin.
@_date: 2017-05-18 19:46:44
@_date: 2017-07-21 04:31:29
I'm also trying to figure out what exchange to use since I believe coinbase said they won't follow the "main" consensus.
However, based off this site ( the top exchanges that allow bank transfers are cex.io, kraken, bitfinex, bitsquare, and gdax. I personally don't know how trustworthy or fast these exchanges are though.
@_date: 2017-07-21 09:03:54
Damn thank you for this info, this is stuff I was looking for.
Also, quick question, I read an article here that coinbase is not supporting the User Activated Hard Fork... this UAHF is the main consensus right? 
So this means that the "real" bitcoin is not supported on coinbase anymore, right?
@_date: 2017-05-27 18:59:05
If you buy at the ATM you will pay a higher fee, because that's how the ATM operators make their money. So say if you look on coingecko.com and see that 1 bitcoin is worth about 2200$. If you go to buy at the ATM, if you buy 1 bitcoin its going to be worth about 2250-2300$ (these are not exact numbers as each Bitcoin ATM company will set their own fees).
Also don't forget to bring a drivers license as the ATM machines will randomly ask you to scan the barcode on the back.
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:28:17
Okay gotchu thanks
@_date: 2017-05-19 07:55:56
Sounds good to me... What's holding up the soft fork?
@_date: 2017-05-15 17:10:57
I would think person to person requires the max transaction fee
@_date: 2017-07-30 02:58:39


Their could be a crippling bug in SegWit... no one knows. But most likely, everything will be fine, and the price will shoot up.
@_date: 2017-05-29 06:58:15
It's only a scam if your plan is to get rich off of it, otherwise, if you understand the technology behind it then NO.
@_date: 2017-05-13 19:08:56
wow nice, thank you.
@_date: 2017-05-12 01:05:35
Yeah that makes sense... I've been thinking in terms of the price for 1 coin
@_date: 2017-05-15 01:00:12
Is there any site like coinbase out there that isn't as bad as coinbase at the moment? 
Just as a reference when I start to use something like it.

Have you ever had any problems transferring bitcoin into a bank(USD) ?? If no, what bank? Thanks.
@_date: 2017-07-21 04:42:08
Nice, thanks for these sites.
However, I just want to know which banks are more sympathetic to bitcoin just in case bitcoin goes way up and I want to transfer to usd the fastest way possible.
@_date: 2017-05-11 19:49:53
yeah i feel stupid, thanks.
@_date: 2017-07-04 20:30:55
Make sure u wait for at least 1 confirmation with the person before parting ways.

Why buy if price increasing, knowing that its going to dip?
@_date: 2017-07-30 02:16:08
I'm looking more for something where if you wanted to buy bitcoin from me in exchange for fiat online.
You would send me fiat, then I would send you bitcoin.
Very interesting site though, would be cool to see that in more countries.

when you say "business tax capped at 4%" is that the same thing as the corporate tax?
@_date: 2017-05-27 18:43:35
Specifically read about the block chain technology and understand what makes it different from other technologies in the world.
Also a healthy mindset to have is one where if you get rich from bitcoin/altcoins that's cool, but if you don't you should still be excited to have your very own public and private key(s).
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:15:12
You can legally bet on contracts(legally binding document) that is linked to Bitcoin... so lets say you don't have any bitcoin, you can purchase this contract and bet on it in it's own separate market.
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:20:53
What was the cost of one ATM? And what are some other upfront costs when setting it up?
As far as increasing business I believe the location and advertisement is key.
Like where do a lot of techies hang out? Put cheap paper ads around colleges and nightlife areas.

do you happen to know if the ATM's keep up with the daily price fluctuations?
And/or possibly how long it takes to update the price?

So the node software links the block chain data between the two hard drives automatically or do i have to adjust some settings?
@_date: 2017-07-31 00:04:07
What's the brand of the ATM? If it's Coinsource than go here to see the sell rate ( 
The rate to sell at an ATM is lower than on an exchange due to it's convenience, so you won't be getting as much fiat for your coin.
Also Coinsource ATM's have a daily withdrawal limit of $3000.
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:41:22
Not. What if it crashes?
@_date: 2017-07-25 05:19:44


Can someone ELI5?
@_date: 2017-07-21 04:25:02
Did you tell your bank that you will be transferring funds from a bitcoin exchange??
I was reading some other posts and this guy said he told a couple different banks that he was going to be doing a lot of transferring from a bitcoin exchange into the bank and they told him NO. 
So he essentially said don't tell the bank that you are transferring from a btc exchange... but I'm thinking that if you don't tell them that this could cause problems.
@_date: 2017-07-25 02:46:54

How would I send bitcoin to someone and they send me fiat in return ?
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:43:40
Do you have a Bitcoin ATM sign outside? 
Maybe put bitcoin fliers with physical location address in a mile radius around the ATM in coffee shops, food shops, smoke shops, etc.
Create a social media presence (making sure u put info on flier) where you post and retweet good news on bitcoin, altcoins, and what they will do for the future.
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:21:08

How do you know whats a good fee/byte? 
@_date: 2017-05-15 00:56:04
so in order to send those same coins to your self, you just type in that exact amount and the wallet knows to send those coins and not a new batch of coin?
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:27:39


I don't understand. How?
@_date: 2017-05-13 18:30:16

Anyone actually working thru this? 
I'm stuck on Exercise 1 (Authenticated Data Structures) inside the princeton_bitcoin_book.pdf. The pdf can be found in a link, on top of the course syllabus page.
The question is "Devise a protocol where proof size, verification time, and digest size are all sublinear?". Anyone have any ideas?
@_date: 2017-06-01 18:25:51
Can't have both ... a coffee purchases use case means faster transaction times which means bigger blocks which leads to centralization defeating bitcoins original purpose.
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:40:44


Wait so do u mean we should create multiple private keys or create multiple addresses from one private key?
