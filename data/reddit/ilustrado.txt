I guess it is! Thank you [magic internet money wizards]( I already really like this community.

Heh, nah, someone sent me some "Pandacoin" yesterday and I had no idea what it was. Tried to play around with that, but that whole currency seemed really weird and underground.
(edit: just checked my inbox and the pandacoin wasn't from changetip, however I did have a changetip account set up from a loong time ago.)
But hey, thanks! I appreciate the help. What wallet would you recommend instead of the bitcoin-core? Really not wanting to download the 20+ gb "blockchain" file.

Scammed? How so? I was under the impression that all the mining is done by you directly.

Oh sweet, thanks for that sub. I'll be sure to check it out. 
@_date: 2014-11-16 18:58:42
Woah, wait, according to the changetip post...


$19.18?! If that's accurate than holy shit, thanks dude. I feel like that's one of those things that would have been an accident, so if it was, pm me and i'll send it back. but if it wasn't an accident, than, well, *hngh.* Thank you :')

Haha, while that does sound kinda cool, it's not my intention. I'm just vastly curious on how the market works, what bitcoin mining entails, and all the other details like that.

Thank you! :)
This is one nice little happy place.

So building a low budget mining computer part-by-part is just not viable whatsoever? How do the BTC's get mined at all, if no one bothers with mining?

Very interesting. I just did the 12 word verification about a minute ago, so i'm set on that. Do you know where to find the private key? I wouldn't mind writing it down just for safe-keeping.
And you mentioned


Is security really this big of an issue? Does theft just often occur out of nowhere? That just seems like a pretty drastic step, although I do understand why to do it, I don't understand what risk I face if I don't do that.

Hm, well, I guess I'll have to research more into that myself. Seems weird that the whole process of mining the currency is regarded as an inefficient way to *get* the currency.

I have an Android phone, yeah. So if I get Mycelium, I won't need a desktop client? Everything i'd ever need to do with bitcoin will be handled by Mycelium?
Also, what's a paper wallet? 
Sorry for asking so many questions x:

Nope, it didn't work.
