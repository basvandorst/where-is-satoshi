Subbed for interest. 
In essence, couldn't this be used to DDoS a bank? Then the bank would have incentive to join the pool and vote against attacking itself, thereby FORCING the bank to hold crypto in order to keep its business going.
Genius if you ask me.

The biggest players pretty much just denounced Gox publicly. Have you read the statement? Gox has either been bought out by another Bitcoin Exchange (BTCChina) or a wealthy group of investors - maybe the Winklevoxx Twins, or maybe even by a large bank.

I think this is perfect. There is something so awesome about the Bitcoin ecosystem to me. As soon as we realize that something isn't working - ie, centralized exchanges, a developer comes up with a solution, implements it, and the market adopts it. No federal regulations to get in the way. Real free-market stuff.

great tip! I'm gonna sacrifice .5 BTC and see what I can do with it. Didn't know thats how it worked. I thought I needed a Gox account, which I do not have. I have coinbase though. I'm thinking I'll create a hotwallet, transfer .5 from CB to HotWallet, then from hot wallet to coinbuilder. Buy @ 0.315 and sell when it goes higher, then just withdraw my coins? Is it that easy?

Yea I know the feeling. Honestly, I just prefer iOS. I have a Mac Pro, a Macbook Pro, an iPad Mini, Airport Extreme, Apple TVx2 and an iPhone. I'm definitely a techno-geek, and I loved Windows/Android (up until Windows Vista ruined Microsoft's image, and Android's lack of good apps was pissing me off). Jailbreak your iPhone and you have just as much, if not more functionality, than Android devices. Plus, half of the reason I like Apple (and I pay the premium) is because I like the sexiness of the product. There is not a single laptop that looks and feels like a Macbook Pro, nor a single phone that feels like an iPhone (and works in my car, home, etc). No, I am not an Apple fan-boy, I just think they make a superior product.

"The scale on the right, corresponding to the Dow’s DJIA +1.22%   movement in 1928 and 1929, extends from below 200 to more than 400—an increase of more than 100%. The left axis, in contrast, represents a percentage increase of less than 50%.
But there’s less to this objection than you might think. You can still have a high correlation coefficient between two data series even when their gyrations are of different magnitudes.
However, what is important, McClellan said, is that the time scales of the two data series need to be the same. And, he stresses, there has been no stretching of the time dimension to make them fit."

Well the government clearly knows it has value, or they wouldn't have seized coins from SR, etc. Furthermore, California and NY are considering regulations, which would clearly recognize BTC as value. Either way, it is still technically a "loss due to fraud/theft". Now it just depends on if the government can make a case that bitcoin's value fell and it is like an investment loss, not a casualty loss. However, it will be tough to show that if the price across the other exchanges is still steady.

Well your loss would be calculate either by 1) the adjusted basis (amount you invested in the bitcoin) or 2) the price of the bitcoin at a certain time (hard to figure out). You'd probably get  if you're lucky. Good for people that bought in at the $1000 range. Bad for people who bought in at the $100 range

Depending on the card, you can always get 2-day shipping. I've had my card stolen once and an ATM just ate my card one day because it thought I was a fraud. I called the bank, and they 2-day shipped me a replacement card. Good story though.

"Such a car would retail for more than $110,000 new. Although the dealer didn’t say what the Tesla sold for, the Bitcoin buyer would’ve had to shell out around 1,000 units of the virtual currency, assuming the car is new."
That's just bad math. It should be 110 BTC not 1000. If he paid 1000 he's not very smart.

Don't mine unless you have 10k to spend on an ASIC miner. Buy and hold. If you are in the US use coinbase for easy link to bank account. However, I would wait a day or two until the exchanges are back up. They have ALL had some major issues today, Coinbase and Mt.Gox included. Yes, you can buy as little as 0.000000001 BTC.

Based on your second quote, wouldn't that be really bad for the BTC community? If a MAJOR government power says to merchants "you can't sell your stuff for bitcoins". I mean I doubt the US would do something like that (I think it would be unconstitutional to tell people what they can accept as payment for something), do you think the Chinese are going to completely ban BTC?

I was thinking the same thing earlier this week, especially with Sheep Marketplace's coins being scammed, and Silk Road's coins seized. Those dealers and buyers HAVE TO buy more bitcoins to trade. This will inevitably raise the price again.

But ultimately a Texas court means nothing in the grand scheme of things. Was it a state trial court? Appeals court? Circuit Court? Federal Court? Texas Supreme Court?

The future is heading wherever YOU, the consumer, sees it heading. Why did you get into BTC? Did you want to invest? Did you want to see it grow? Did you want to see it adopted by everyone? How much money did you spend? Where are you located? Do you have any experience investing in the past? Are you in it to make a quick buck or are you in it because you BELIEVE in it?

Ultimately, it comes down to the volatility of the market. The reason that you can say that something is "worth $100 USD" today is because tomorrow, it will be worth the same compared to other currencies. As Bitcoin is  relatively new market, the volatility will make it very hard, if not impossible, to set a "BTC price" on something non-relative to a fiat currency.

Well doesn't that depend on how the government will actually categorize bitcoin? If they regulate it and say "this is not money, it is monopoly money", then the laws would in fact not be the same.

Good luck taking some of the back-web torrent sites off the internet.

It is, but literally 99.999% of people don't understand that, so I say invest. Also, you can invest in currency - If I though the Yen was going to skyrocket in the next 2 years, I would sell my USD for YEN, which would be investing. I think the same is true for BTC now.
