If you don't want him to know anything now, put the coins on a hardware wallet and don't tell anyone your PIN. Put the wallet seed on paper and put it in a bank vault and will it to him.

Ah, I read some more. I get it. Thanks.

This is just the futures price for Bitcoin on Jan 8. It's not the actual price of bitcoin. Just people betting what it will be in a month.
If the price of Bitcoin were to go on a 5k swing, it would definitely affect the price of the futures, but the futures operates with these 10% halts.

How did they gift it to you? Did you make an account on any exchange? You'd just log into the account where you deposited it and check.

The problem is that if mining becomes less profitable, miners might switch to mining other coins, which will lead to that coin increasing in value over Bitcoin

Can you find the comment in your post history where this happened?
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:45:15
Really? Then what's the point of having it?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:16:22
It means if the price reaches that level, it will start to sell, but there may not be enough orders at that level to fill it, so it will keep selling at lower priced orders until you have nothing left.

If you're really worried, you should have a story or something for each transaction made from the exchange where you registered your ID. By looking at the block chain its possible to find the date and amount of every transaction to or from any public key.

If you can legally deposit your bitcoins in a bank account in a country that has no capital gains tax, then you wouldn't need to pay tax on them
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:21:04
Everything except Bitcoin Cash. It's up 10%

I'm in the same boat, living in China. The problem is the mailing address. I think all Canadian exchanges ask for proof of address to link your bank account. I got stuck at Kraken and Quadriga at that point... You can however use a credit card on Coinbase.
OP, either:
1) Sign up on Coinbase, use your passport to register, and then buy them with your credit card. You'll have a 2.5% fee, which sucks, but Bitcoin's up over 20% in the last 24 hours. You'll start with a $250 weekly limit, which can increase after you spend $500.
2) Buy on LocalBitcoins. I don't know how that works in Australia, but it was easy and pretty cheap here in China.
3) Sign up on an Australian exchange and attach your Australian bank account if you have one.

What do you mean? If there's no capital gains taxes in your country, you don't pay capital gains...

Bithumb in Korea is holding steading at 19.5k. We'll bounce back up when the US exchanges get their shit together.

I think there were different tip bots. If you find the one that tipped you, you can probably look it up.

Bitcoin just ate through a sell wall like it was butter
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:06:30
Yeah. Trading hasn't started, but theres 1800+ sell orders to 500 buy orders right at the margin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:18:54
I guess I should have said next week not next year haha.
Did you get your shit sorted out? You in this insanity?
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:35:21
Ah, cool. Maybe it was another site that had the address.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:23:24
The base cost is 1 bitcoin? That's nuts. I get the 5% deal if he's successful in recovering your password, but I'm not paying anyone 17,000 USD just for 3 Skype calls. Maybe that fee hasn't been changed in a couple months
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:21:08
If you memorize the seeds, and destroy the paper, there's no evidence that you control the public keys in your wallet unless you published this anywhere.
If someone questions you about the Bitcoin you bought, you can say you sent it to a friend in a different country. There's nothing they can do to prove you still own it.

That's a pretty standard fee at the moment. The network is quite congested and higher fees are necessary to get confirmed that quickly.
It was Coinbase that set the fee, not the miners. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:03:52
Look at them sell orders... proud of yall
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:36:48
Hm. Weird. Well, I'd be okay with 10% increases every day :D
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:17:54
Anyone know when the trading will actually go live?
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:33:53
Okay. If this is true... What if their halt is triggered at 16500 but before the next day of trading, the price is ushed up to 17000? Is the next halt set to 10% over 17000 or over 16500?

Are you sure? On other exchanges you have to wait for the money transfer to complete before you then use it to buy the coins. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:24:24
And now $5 off 9.5k
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:03:33
Either way, it's not a big deal, don't worry.
You didn't buy at 10,000 to sell at 11,000, did you?
If the price increases to 20,000 next year the difference between 10k and 11k is small. If it eventually increases to 100,000, the difference is all but meaningless.

Screw the end of the week. If this keeps up, it'll be there in an hour or two.
