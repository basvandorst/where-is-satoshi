Should be up voted to the moon. Posts like this determine the maturity of the investor/believer. A quick buck is never so easy. Most people that are now BTC millionaires I'm sure they didn't see it coming. Now we have a whole bunch of crypto millionaires wannabe. Rethink your strategy and once again don't invest more money that you are willing to spend. When I was on my late teens I spent all the money my parents had given me gambling in the casino. Chasing after my initial lost I invested way more that I was willing to lose, to the point that I didn't have food to eat. It's a lesson I will never forget. Never gamble again. I'm into crypto not only for the profit but most of all because I believe that this will be a game changer technology that I want to be part of.

And I do understand that, I know people for the very same reasons you mention. But imagina that resources where always there for everyone, don't you think it would change the future generations approach? Of course its not a digital currency that will change it. Like I mentioned the whole system has to be changed. Capitalism doesn't work. The disparities we see around us are ever widening. The paradigm has to change towards a resource based economy, its far fetched but it would be awesome. Look it up. And if you haven't seen the zeitgeist movies I recommend.

Absolutely, it gets me so frustrated to see all the pump and masses interest for the fake shit like ripple and bcash.

If you adopted, you would have to spend any BTC and you'd make a dogs life less miserable.

Pulling out all my crypto from their wallets.

Zeitgeist says that's not the human nature. That's what our past events program us to be like. Yeah humans do want more. It's just a shame that we live in a system that to get more someone has to get less. The whole concept is flawed and not sustainable. The worst is still to come.

Indeed. Making a vegetable soup from scratch costs cents. The same goes for all other healthy meals. I was raised within a healthy diet. Of course we would eat fast food every now and then. We loved it. I still do. But it's a fact that if eat like shit you feel like shit. Anyway let's keep the price of btc going up ��
