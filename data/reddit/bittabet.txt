Well, BTC price has been dropping quite a bit due to the fee situation causing a lot of drama and people moving to alts and Jihan is one of the biggest BTC holders in the world so while I'm sure he enjoys being able to mine huge fees all day long, he also needs BTC to succeed since that's where most of his wealth is.

I'm really glad I consolidated back when the fees were much lower (about 1-2 sats/byte I think) and I still paid like $15 lol.  But this was due to literally hundreds of inputs from mining pool outputs.  Doh.

Problem is that most Proof of Stake systems don't actually risk all the coins held on the staking nodes, sometimes they'll use a bond system, sometimes they'll just stake without being spendable, etc. whereas on LN if a node is hacked the coins are much more vulnerable. I don't think it's really worth the small fees to risk all your bitcoin in what are essentially hot wallets.

It reduces fees by about 30% on average, not 50-75% like you're claiming. But I'm seeing more and more people complaining about fees even on these transactions so it's not really the solution long term either.  
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:41:15
Yes but they still make massive amounts of money.  Bittrex takes 0.5% of every single transaction on their site and there's many billions in transactions per day so they make millions every single day.
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:08:08
140 sats/byte can take days to clear even using a segwit transaction. [This 168 sats/byte segwit to segwit tx took 3 days]( so suggesting that someone use 140 sats/byte is basically telling them to send a tx that may or may not clear for several days, especially if they're not using segwit. I'd use at least 200 sats/byte for segwit to segwit and likely more for legacy unless you're willing to wait weeks.
@_date: 2018-01-23 10:43:46
If you qualify, I would get a USAA checking account since they even have [Coinbase integration]( so there's pretty much zero chance of them blocking Coinbase since it makes no sense to integrate linking Coinbase and then block transactions.
Everyone just needs to bring ALL their money over to crypto friendly institutions so we don't get jerked around.
@_date: 2018-01-02 07:32:45
For exchanges that hold very large amounts of Bitcoin it takes time to make sure that you can safely implement Segwit without worsening the security of your wallets. It's honestly not realistic to expect fast implementation because the exchanges care more that their Bitcoins don't suddenly get hacked than they do about transaction fees.

RSK is very centralized even compared to Ethereum. Plus to be honest most people who want to develop Ethereum style dapps already bought a ton of Ethereum so they're not going to go suddenly  switch to Bitcoin so they can use a pegged sidechain. Seriously, is there any project actually switching to RSK from Ethereum?
Some core devs are also strongly against RSK, like [Peter Todd]( since merge mining would mean the mining nodes that merge mine RSK have to transact huge Ethereum style blocks. 
If RSK had launched in 2015 then maybe they could have stolen Ethereum's thunder and argued that being based on the more secure Bitcoin blockchain was a huge advantage but at this point I just don't see people switching to using RSK. I would love to be proven wrong since I don't own any Ethereum at all, but at this point I'm just regretful that I didn't buy into the ICO (especially since the $5K I would have thrown at it would be something insane like $120 million now lol).
Frankly RSK is a dumb idea, and there's just too many Ethereum developers now for RSK to stop Ethereum.

@_date: 2018-01-17 11:36:34
But that was mostly because Bitcoin was the only liquid trading pair on exchanges. As the fees have risen for using Bitcoin to transfer between exchanges more and more people have traded against ETH pairs or other liquid pairs in order to send between exchanges and wallets more cheaply, which has slowly eroded Bitcoin's status as the reserve currency and also pumped up Ethereum's price like crazy because everyone is trying to sell their alts for ETH. If trade volume against BTC continues to erode it'll further harm Bitcoin's price, right now people are still primarily trading against BTC which is helping cushion BTC from the huge drops, but if you look at trade volumes against alts Ethereum already has 1/3rd of BTC's trade volume.
I think over time the benefit of Bitcoin being a reserve currency of crypto will slowly continue to erode as people trade against other alternatives, so we can't really count on this long term.
@_date: 2018-01-22 04:04:31

High fee transactions do not clog up the network at all since they're processed right away. Here's an example of what happens when a [segwit enabled exchange sends a transaction with lower fees]( For an exchange not to get multiple angry e-mails/calls from their customers asking "where are my Bitcoins" they pretty much have to send with an absurdly high fee. You have to remember that they have to hire those customer service reps and pay them money to work to answer those phone calls, so simply overpaying an extra few bucks in fees is likely cheaper than having to deal with complaints about a transaction. I do think GDAX/Coinbase overpays by a little bit too much but they're basically trying to ensure that they never have to deal with customer complaints about it.
@_date: 2018-01-29 05:28:18
That's poor UTXO management though, if you're using a secured system and paranoidally checking the transaction data before broadcast it should be fine. But I definitely get the fear, lol.
Still, you're basically going to clutter up the blockchain in the future, so if everyone does what you're doing we end up with higher fees because everyone's future transactions have more inputs.
It may seem just like a few cents in fees to you, but the problem is that when everyone does this we end up with super high fees. Imagine if every input out there was two instead and you can quickly see why this is really bad.

@_date: 2018-01-08 08:07:36
Well, on the bright side if enough people simply stop accepting Bitcoin entirely then the network load will drop and fees will drop. On the downside that also means people are abandoning Bitcoin and it's not clear that anybody will come back.

Their mining contracts are HORRIBLE.  I took a look at their flyer and it literally has a printout advertising consistent mining returns every month over 24 months without accounting for difficulty. Even worse they keep HALF of everything you mine with them.  It seems like Kodak is just doing the hosting too, some other company is running the operation and supplying the hardware.  Their math is completely nuts, they're claiming if you pay $3400 up front you'll mine back $375 a month for 24 months, lol.
But I do see people who are new to this space falling for it unfortunately so maybe it'll make Kodak a ton of money.
@_date: 2018-01-22 04:21:32
What are you talking about, the tx per day is down to ~200K from 400-500K during the really bad fee periods, and during those periods the transactions likely would have been higher if it weren't for the crazy fees.
@_date: 2018-01-28 04:40:04
Yes but if it's a known bug having random people harass you about it slows you down.
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:16:20
I think the problem is that most people wanted Core to support a similar increase, not to run software without any developers behind it. I'm not even sure we needed such a large increase, probably a 50% bump from where we are now would have been sufficient to buy us time to get segwit fully adopted and LN up and running. High fees actually make it harder to adopt segwit since it'd be very costly to move all existing inputs to new segwit addresses, so by having lower fees more people are likely to be able to very cheaply adopt segwit.
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:12:50
Even if people don't want to cash out they want it to be valuable, and also to be easily spendable. It's not going to be decentralized either if absolutely nobody outside of a few extremists care about it, that's the reality. There really should have been a better planned scaling approach.

$1000 in Ethereum during that same time period is over $23 million at the moment though...one of my great regrets that I didn't invest in the ICO 
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:05:32
To be entirely fair though this is the default behavior for most Bitcoin wallets and even if you don't create a new change address there's often a change UTXO created anyways. Their real mistake was simply not cleaning up this mess of dust UTXO's once in a while.
I do think that was a big part of why they were pushing for segwit2x though, so they'd be able to clean this up affordably. Since they can't really clean it up at this point they're just putting their support behind Ethereum more heavily.
In reality the easiest way for Coinbase to fix this at this point is just to spend money on either renting or buying mining hardware and mining their own UTXOs to clean them up instead of paying tons of fees, they have more than enough funding to do so anyways, but I think they're just much more pro-Ethereum at this point due to having backed Segwit2x.
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:37:53
Not all of them though, the exchanges hold a fair amount themselves to allow for liquidity across different exchanges, and while it's not proven I would suspect for Tether to actually function and maintain it's peg the exchanges are likely involved in market making for Tethers on their own exchanges. Otherwise the peg would fly all over the place as people trade in and out of tethers.

@_date: 2018-01-02 07:24:50
Yes but if on-chain fees keep going up you can't just leave the scene, because your wallet addresses may become completely worthless with unusable inputs.
Let's say fees hit $1000 like some people think they will, then by the time you come back you may find that you may or may not have usable inputs, or you may be paying a huge percentage of your wealth just to move the Bitcoin. 
I would say to keep an eye on fees, to make sure that you're not going to wipe out your own wealth.
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:09:25
The problem is that this "rough patch" may become a permanent problem if people just use alternative blockchains entirely, so I think it was a mistake to not have an interim scaling solution until LN was actually production ready. Which is probably why all the big businesses were heavily pushing for segwit2x. Maybe folks don't care about what businesses use, but in the real world if every single business starts accepting stellar and ethereum via Stripe (which is one of the largest payment processors in the world) then while Bitcoin may still be censorship resistant nobody will use it. It also becomes quite hard to convince people that it's really useful as digital gold if there are other alternatives that work both as digital gold and also as cheap and fast currencies.
Refusing to have an interim scaling solution really throws away a large portion of Bitcoin's first mover advantage. There will be no advantage to being the first mover if all the existing Bitcoin payment processors now support alternative currencies. Right now if someone uses Coinbase as their payment processor they already have 2 other alternatives, and if Stripe adds Ethereum or Stellar it's going to make this even worse.
Upcoming exchanges that plan to allow fiat currency exchange directly with other alternative cryptocurrencies are also going to be an issue.
It honestly pains me a lot since most of my holdings are in Bitcoin but if this "rough patch" isn't over within a few months it may never be over.
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:01:53
They're much more pro-Ethereum than they are pro-Bitcoin or even Bitcoin Cash, Armstrong has said repeatedly that he holds more Ethereum and with the recent runup in price he probably holds many times in Ethereum what he does in Bitcoin. Not to mention they clearly spend a lot more time developing software to run Ethereum dapps than working with Bitcoin.
That said I don't think they're exactly anti-Bitcoin, they're just really very pro-Ethereum.
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:43:00
It's not just investors though, the exchanges use Tethers to help balance out their own holdings across exchanges so they're also pumping money into USDT. Kraken and Bittrex have to have sufficient Tethers on hand to allow people to sell into USDT at all times otherwise the whole system doesn't work.
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:31:58
No, spending BTC is considered the same as selling it for fiat by the IRS, so you still owe the capital gains just as if you had sold that exact same amount of BTC.

@_date: 2018-01-08 08:17:44
This is idiotic logic, I thought most of the issues with segwit2x was that they didn't want another (lousy) development team taking over and not with the actual blocksize increase? Obviously excessively large blocksizes will cause centralization but I don't believe anybody really felt that the segwit2x blocksize was the issue, they just didn't want to support garzik taking over development of Bitcoin. It's pretty clear that we need a bridge to a blocksize/blockweight at least similar to what segwit2x was proposing.
@_date: 2018-01-22 04:23:51
Trusting a third party system is not a good idea, if it malfunctions you end up sending a bunch of stuck tx or insanely overpaying fees. But yes, Coinbase really needs to implement something less idiotic than paying insane fees.
Hopefully they roll this out along with batching and segwit, it seems like they really didn't put enough effort into keeping fees low over the years, and just depended on the blocks not being full.

Honestly I'm very worried that it's too little and too late, a bunch of exchanges have added huge amounts of trading pairs with Ethereum instead of Bitcoin which is causing more folks to use Ethereum as a reserve currency of sorts. I still think Bitcoin is better as a reserve currency since it's the most secure blockchain and most proven, but if most trade switches from BTC pairs to Ethereum pairs we're screwed. And for the folks who think that this doesn't matter-it does because if Ethereum is more valuable according to the market then they'll have the more secure chain in time. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:33:56
Bitfinex is not all that new nor is it magical when multiple exchanges are buying Tethers to help improve their liquidity. Do you really not believe that the exchange ecosystem doesn't have a need for a few billion dollars? Kraken holds a ton of Tether, Bittrex holds a ton of tether, do you think they just magically obtained Tether without paying for them? I don't really get why you think it's an impossibility for billions to have flooded into the crypto markets.

They mean soft off like most computers are when you tell it to shut down. There's still power flowing to the motherboard to allow features like Wake-On-LAN or waking it up via the keyboard/mouse to function. Obviously, if you hard cut the power going to the motherboard then it won't work, but 99.999% of systems that are shut down still have small amounts of power flowing to the motherboard to allow these features to work.
Now that said, I would assume that the design of the motherboard would still have to give the CPU a small supply of power for the ME to function even in this scenario, and I'm not sure if this is really the case for most motherboards or not. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 07:16:47
Folks who used to mine or regularly buy small amounts on a weekly basis end up with inputs like this, which is unfortunately a fairly large number of folks. So they really had to stay on the ball and consolidate their inputs when the mempool was low. I think I still spent like $15 consolidating at 1 satoshi/byte because I had so many tiny inputs from mining payouts.

What good is dominance if we're all broke too? I find it very interesting that unlike previous drops in alts where people moved into Bitcoin as a safe haven this time they're clearly cashing out entirely and running for fiat. Which means people are no longer treating Bitcoin as a reserve currency as much as they used to, or the outflows from Bitcoin are so large that even the inflows from alts can't keep the price up.
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:34:56
Well to be fair people here constantly complain that GDAX/Coinbase uses much higher fees than this as overpaying, it looks like OKEX was trying to pay a fee on the lower side that would still get confirmed soon especially since it's a segwit tx, and they must have figured that since this is a segwit transaction this fee level was enough. Problem is that fees can suddenly jump due to the mempool being so overloaded, so their fee guess was completely wrong here. It's also a pretty large transaction so probably isn't as easy for a miner to randomly pack into a block. I think we probably need a small blocksize increase to really get the fees back down to something more practical even if segwit is fully adopted at this point though, to have gotten this transaction through quickly you'd likely have been hit with a $80+ fee.
@_date: 2018-01-14 04:56:51

Right now the alts seem to have jumped more than bitcoin though they also tumbled more severely.  But I'm seeing some alts recover above what they were before the big Korea freakout dip.

I don't get how this is hilarious, they clearly care more now about developing the Ethereum ecosystem than the Bitcoin ecosystem largely because people have been attacking them over the last year, so now they're very clearly trying to shift customers over to buying Ethereum and supporting that. 
Coinbase doesn't care where they make their money guys, they don't care in Bitcoin over Ethereum, their job is to make themselves more money whether that's selling Ethereum or Litecoin or Bitcoin or Ripples or whatever. Expecting them to only worship Bitcoin is insane, and constantly attacking them about Segwit will just make them not want to deal with Bitcoin even more. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 04:31:27
The mining reward will drop over time though so unless Bitcoin becomes worth tens of millions over the next decade it's unlikely to ever actually eat up that much power. There's also other costs to mining other than just electricity, you have to have a datacenter, you have to have actual hardware, power supplies, cooling, etc. so using the price of electricity is rather silly.
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:47:52

The problem is that the only blocks that have really hit this size involved some huge players consolidating a ton of inputs all at once.

I've run the full node on virtual machines with far less memory and it ran just fine even after segwit was activated so I doubt the RAM usage is really that terrible in the real world. Didn't see a lot of swap activity or anything crazy either.

It's a combination of less transactions in general as well as a lot of new hashpower coming online that's causing blocks to come in faster than 10 minutes. Seems like a lot of this is Bitmain though since TSMC is saying that 5% of their 16nm chip output is now from Bitmain orders.
Once the difficulty adjusts though the block times will go back to 10 minutes so the backlog may grow again.
On the bright side, it seems like people really think the price of Bitcoin will keep growing since otherwise it'd be insane to push the difficulty up and deploy this much mining hardware. At this point mining costs must be out of control since China is really clamping down on the subsidized power that most miners use.

If Tether goes bust it'd actually be better for BTC since it'd go back to being the real reserve currency for crypto. In fact, altcoin traders being able to "flee" into Tethers has stopped Bitcoin from skyrocketing when alts fall (see recent weeks) whereas it used to be what people fled into when alts dropped.
The problem is of course that Bitfinex going bust will definitely hurt Bitcoin's price in the interim as well, but I would think long term it'd actually be a pro for Bitcoin's price.
Unless of course, people just switch to Ethereum or something else =(

Their actual security model isn't really dependent on Chip and Pin or anything, it's mostly the AI systems that detect fraudulent charges and automatically reject purchases that prevent the majority of fraud. They look at spending patterns, location patterns, etc. to stop charges from going through. So if you've never shopped at Walmart in your entire life and all of a sudden your car is swiped at a Walmart in Wisconsin when you live in Florida the charge is very likely to get flagged. It's much more complicated than that but these systems have gotten exceedingly good at guessing when a charge is fraudulent, which is why they're going to be getting rid of [signature requirements entirely in the US for most purchases soon]( and not requiring the PINs either of course.
I've found that these systems to be a little bit overly cautious and flag a bunch of legitimate purchases I want, but card issuers are able to send you an e-mail immediately for you to confirm it was you or not nowadays so it's less obnoxious than it used to be.

Some alts are going to adopt LN as well though, like Stellar so the fees on those networks will still be far lower than Bitcoin since the base fee is lower.

Yeah when we originally used to mine bitcoin we just referred to it as distributed network computing, lol.
@_date: 2018-01-29 05:44:19
Most miners pretty closely monitor hashrate from each device on their pool though, so I doubt this is a real issue from any practical standpoint. Maybe if you were really dedicated and wrote a malicious firmware that drained off 1% of hashrate it could work but then you'd just have 29 miners worth of hashpower and also have people hunting for you.
@_date: 2018-01-29 05:35:07
Yes but lower difficulty means it's easier for someone to attack the chain as well, so a state actor could more easily obtain enough hashpower to attack Bitcoin. By having so much hashpower that you literally need an entire country's worth of electricity to mat ch the existing hashrate it actually makes it very difficult for someone at attack, at least without investing an obscene amount of money on electricity infrastructure. But obviously it's only really secure if the massive hashrate is spread all over the world. Still, having a high difficulty is good for security. Lots of small miners can't really compete with lots of datacenters.
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:56:37
A lack of a block size increase would also spell the end of Bitcoin as the dominant cryptocurrency, and I find that rather more likely than a block size increase dooming Bitcoin long term-it's going to need a block size increase for LN to scale anyway, how does bringing forward the increase doom it long term? I don't think anybody is arguing for gigantic blocks, just something large enough to relieve fee pressures enough to allow continued adoption.

None of things you're claiming have been proven regarding the shady stuff you're claiming. Right now people are afraid they're doing that but they may very well really have all the funds too. A ton of money flowed into crypto and Bitfinex...look at how much money flowed into GDAX or Korean exchanges. Bitfinex onboards all their cash as USDT so having billions in USDT backed by actual reserves is actually much more likely than that they've just been printing empty fake USDT.
Do you really think they're the only exchange where people didn't send in money?
@_date: 2018-01-28 04:37:30
That just means that they foresaw the situation where rapid adoption made fees spike to unusable levels and slowed down further adoption and wanted to buy time for scaling solutions like LN to be developed. Demonizing every 2x supporter is silliness. They just didn't realize what a mess it would become.
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:45:53
Yeah to be honest I definitely see from their perspective why they can't just release a long list of the bank accounts that are used for Tethers, since the entire thing is basically an end run around banking access restrictions they've had. So it's not like it's directly held in bank accounts with easy to prove ownership. And they also don't really WANT people to know they control particular bank accounts, because then those accounts can be seized by governments or shut down by banks. They're basically stuck in a hard place where they can't really prove they have the money because then it'd cause them huge problems.
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:11:05
I really do wish that crypto exchanges would move to this more stock brokerage style fee system, instead of the murderous percentage fees that absolutely drain the markets. Mostly they just end up owning tons of crypto over time, think of how much volume flows through an exchange like Bittrex and they're taking 0.5% of every single transaction (0.25% from the seller and 0.25% from the buyer).  That's completely nuts.

If you paid such a low fee by the time it clears your invoice will be long expired so you'll have to get them to send back your bitcoin minus a transaction fee. Except your payment is so small that subtracting a transaction fee would leave you with negative amounts of money. So essentially your money is gone.
Your best hope is that it takes so long to clear that it gets dropped from the mempool entirely.

The problem is that if you insisting on waiting for some perfect solution people will just stop using Bitcoin entirely and use another cryptocurrency. You're going to lose one of the biggest advantages Bitcoin has in being the first mover. In an ideal world yes it'd be nice to wait for the perfect solution, but what good is a perfect solution when there are no users left? I also don't see how bumping up the blocksize/blockweight by another 50% or something would really be detrimental to Bitcoin long term, larger blocks HAVE to exist long term anyway to allow for LN to really scale so why are we purposely holding back block sizes to the extent that fees are completely insane?
@_date: 2018-01-24 08:29:38
Mostly it sounds like it'll significantly shrink the size that multisig transactions take up. Basically instead of multi-sig transactions actually holding multiple signer's signatures, those multiple signers together sign one signature that gets put into a block.

I think you should point out the fees of other payment methods for comparison. Credit cards run about 2-3%, so it seems like you need about a $50 transaction on Bitcoin to break even against probably the most common digital payment method.

LN developers are saying that testing on mainnet causes them more problems though, because they have to maintain backwards compatibility, so testing on testnet gives them more flexibility than if you cause the mainnet to lock in some problematic features that they would have wanted to change.
So please test on testnet if you want to support LN and help get it to production, there's literally no benefit to testing on mainnet-you're testing for the same bugs but since you're using real funds you can't test as much and if you do find something you're causing a headache for the developers.
Do testing on the testnet meant for testing!!!

Yeah the tax implications of these gifts will be a complete nightmare. Because if the gifter did not yet pay capital gains taxes on the Bitcoins they gifted to Andreas, he'll owe them when he sells the Bitcoin. And he has no idea what the original owner's cost basis would have been, so to be safe he would have to pay cap gains on the entire thing.
That all said I don't think any taxes would be due on receipt here since they're legitimately gifts.
@_date: 2018-01-11 08:21:26
Honestly, even with LN active I think we'd want the actual on-chain transaction fees to be in the single digit dollar level.  If the on-chain fees are too high then LN is no longer secure, because the only security you have against fraud is that you can always go back on-chain to get your money back by transmitting the signed transaction. But if the fee to go back on-chain is pretty much all the money you have in the channel then this security model makes zero sense at all.

What a dumbass...do they really think you can steal MILLIONS OF DOLLARS worth of gift cards and not get caught?!
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:03:10
It's really much worse, because the recipient will then receive $40 that they can't actually spend, because when they try to spend that input they'll have to pay a hefty fee as well, leaving them with $8 of actual utility from the $72 you paid.
One could even argue that that $8 utility isn't even there, because the person receiving your recipient's payment would also need to pay a fee to spend that input and if the fees are this high that $8 becomes entirely worthless.
If there aren't any low fee periods once in a frequent while for folks to consolidate UTXO's then this is going to make anything other than multi-thousand dollar payments pointless very soon. Fees really should be under $1 to facilitate further adoption and for people to be able to someday open up payment channels affordably and avoid centralizing LN hubs excessively.
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:05:06
Yeah that happened around $200 for me. Stopped looking at the prices and just believed Bitcoin would make it just by surviving. Though the drama and infighting over the last year honestly have bummed me out more than any price drops. Now I'm seeing threads in other cryptocurrency subs mocking us.
@_date: 2019-07-28 02:23:20
Yeah, $20K in volume is nothing if you're an active trader. Someone with $100 worth of crypto would generate $6000 in trades just trading in and out a single time per day for 30 days. That's $73K ($200\*365) in trades over a year if you just did $100 in and out once per day since it's $200 in trades per day when you do that.
Folks actively trading with large portfolios have millions or even tens of millions in transactions at this point.
@_date: 2019-07-28 02:31:09
If it's the same year (like you didn't profit on Dec. 31st at 11PM then lost on January 1st at 1AM or something) then yes you now have a $100 loss.
You should still file this with your taxes though since it means you pay taxes on $100 less income, so you'd probably save 20 or 30 bucks or get 20 or 30 more bucks on your tax return. Definitely claim your losses, no point in paying extra taxes.

Right now if you open up a few channels and keep your node online you'll get incoming liquidity from other people opening up channels with you, so many nodes have good incoming liquidity without needing to open their own inbound channels.

Especially with the new mobile non custodial wallets available now, and electrum adding LN support shortly as well there’s no reason to use a custodial wallet. Optimally, run a full Core and LND node but if you can’t running one of the many non custodial light LN nodes is the next best option.

To prevent a bank screwup from destroying you the key should be a 3 of 5 or something similar. Meaning five safety deposit boxes have pieces and you only need any 3 to make a valid key. That way if the bank catches fire or gets hit by an earthquake you're not screwed because there's redundancy. And this way if someone wants to steal the key they have to break into three separate banks which is quite the undertaking.

@_date: 2019-07-28 02:25:01
They're not really all that confusing. Every time you sell higher than you bought you count it as a gain, every time you sell lower than you bought you count it as a loss. Losses and gains within the same year count against each other.  If you hold a long time then long term gains start coming into play but if you're trading frequently that won't really apply anyway.
If you lose more than your gains in the same year you can deduct up to $3000 of that against your income.
This is the exact same way taxes are applied to stocks and many other investments so if you really plan on making any investments at all ever you should know these tax rules. It's only when you get into more complex things like real estate or futures that taxes are somewhat different, but most property is taxed the same way.
The only difference between Bitcoin taxes and stock taxes is that you're actually better off holding Bitcoin because there are no wash sale rules so it's actually easier to deal with than stock taxes.

There was a short squeeze around 10k and then after it ran up past 11k the exchanges crashed and bitfinex had a bunch of margin calls and stop losses in the altcoins that spread to collateral currencies and impacted bitcoin as well.

No, like friggin legendary economists like Milton Friedman [who saw the potential of the internet and predicted Bitcoin]( 
[Friedman supported UBI because if you actually understand economics you’d understand that it’s hugely great for the economy.]( 
Instead of posting bullshit about dipshits like Roubini and Krugman maybe you could do some fucking research and realize that folks who truly understand economics understand both the importance of UBI and of Bitcoin? Idiots like Krugman thought the internet was a fucking fad, real visionary economists like Friedman could see the importance even though they were in their 80s. Lumping idiots like Krugman and Roubini in with the actually legitimate economists who support UBI is moronic. Neither Krugman nor Roubini are supporters of UBI either because they’re visionless idiots. You shitting on UBI is as stupid as Krugman shitting on the internet and Bitcoin.
Bitcoin lets us have a true free market decentralized non governmental currency native to the internet and UBI lets us have a genuine capitalist and market beneficial method of improving literally everyone’s quality of life while strengthening the economy. Maybe you should think about why the same economist that understood that Bitcoin would come someday and understood the importance of the internet also understood that UBI would be needed.

Because it takes time and effort and a lot of work to implement any or all of these things safely without making your exchange much easier to hack?! I don't know why people always post on here about why this exchange or that exchange doesn't "just implement" a feature. Exchanges care first and foremost about security, especially when it comes to software that works on their hot wallets. Otherwise you'll end up like MtGox.
So the main reason why Gemini hasn't messed with their withdrawal system is for the simple fact that they don't want to end up like MtGox.  Any and all changes to this kind of software need to be checked up and down and thoroughly tested before they implement it.
Also if they have insurance on their holdings their insurance company likely needs to clear a lot of this stuff.
@_date: 2019-07-21 03:35:19
I think it's more about how familiar you are with bitcoin transactions than whether you're a software engineer. But essentially this is to prevent attackers from using a chained transactions to stop you from being able to broadcast an emergency channel close. If there is no limit for how many transactions can be chained you could chain a whole bunch of stupid transactions where the sum of all the fees is high in absolute terms but the fee per byte is horrendously low and that would prevent you from being able to broadcast your emergency channel close without broadcasting a transactions with an even higher absolute fee.
This prevents folks from chaining transactions like that, essentially blocking this attack.

They aren't currently but they will be. Channel factories are waiting on Schnorr signatures to pass testing and be implemented on mainnet. Then numerous people can simultaneously open LN channels together en masse. Should result in an approximately 90% reduction in to size based on current estimates. Schnorr is also supposed to shrink other non LN transactions as well so fees will also benefit from that. Now I do think there will be a need for larger block sizes as well to scale but this should buy a fair amount of time.

Yes but it was supposed to replace it EVENTUALLY when the block rewards had dropped significantly, not replace it before anybody had actually adopted it as a currency. The fee situation right now is not a good thing, since it can still murder adoption. Fees being this high have sent people scrambling for alternatives to move money even between exchanges, and once you get people to use alternatives it can mean that people stop using Bitcoin altogether.  If everyone starts to use some other currency to move between exchanges then that currency becomes the reserve currency instead of Bitcoin which is a terrible thing.

Most folks who really, really, really know cryptocurrency are either already indepedently wealthy or are off running their own cryptocurrency hedge funds, without Wall Street. You're looking at a very select group of folks who would really understand crypto deeply AND be willing to work for Wall Street, it'd be later adopters who didn't make it rich by holding along the way who are younger and looking for work but don't want to work for a dedicated crypto firm.

Oh gosh, tell me about it, back in 2010 I knew about it and I had been involved in a bunch of distributed computing teams like folding and whatnot, and even ran a large team. I read all about Bitcoin and thought about mining it but figured trying to solve cancer by folding proteins was probably more important, right?
I think I eventually got around to mining some Bitcoin for fun the next year (2011) but then I sold all those for $8.
Then there were all those times I had identified really promising altcoins like NXT, Eth, and IOTA, and ended up missing their ICOs by a few hours or a few days and those were similarly insane fortunes I almost had.
But the thing is, I ended up doing OK anyways, since I finally realized that I needed to suck it up and buy some Bitcoin since I still believed in it.  You can't keep focusing on what you could have bought or mined or whatever for pennies on the dollar (or more like pennies on the $20 these days), there's still so much opportunity and I'm buying into projects I think have a lot of potential and buying Bitcoin.

More mining doesn't drive the fees down as Bitcoin's difficulty will just go up and keep block times at a 10 minute average.  What are you talking about? More miners coming online doesn't change the throughput, it just makes the network more secure.

Who said anything about evading?!  I didn't owe any capital gains because I bought over 20K of bitcoin and spent some immediately on mining equipment and then send the rest to my personal wallets...what the fuck does the IRS need my transaction records for when they have no evidence of tax evasion?!  This is a gross invasion of privacy and a fishing expedition with nothing to back it up. Now I'll probably have to deal with their bs audit which is a headache in and of itself just because of their stupid BS.  Why not just request records of people who actually sold $20K!?
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:50:41

In ten years 0.83 Bitcoin will most likely be worth a hell of a lot more than 7.8oz of gold.  I'd take the Bitcoin, it's more of a gamble but it's not like continuing to have $10K of gold is going to be life changing. $10K is nice, but over ten years you can easily make that kind of money working, you can't easily make the kind that 0.83BTC will be in ten years.
There's no reason to believe that gold will skyrocket in price in ten years, if anything it will drop if Bitcoin replaces it as digital gold.

I think the real question now is even if LN is proven stable and safe enough for full implementation on mainnet, will enough people be willing to pay the fees needed to onboard onto LN? For folks who only have something like $100 of Bitcoin, if there's increased demand to use Bitcoin and also demand for onboarding to LN the fees may be even worse than right now. You still need the base block to have enough capacity where people can open up a LN channel cheaply enough that it makes sense. Nobody's going to pay $40 to open a LN channel so they can put their $200 of Bitcoin in there. You really still want to have main chain fees for opening a channel to be something more like $5 or $10, so that normal folks would be willing to deal with this.

There's already several other exchanges in the US, including Gemini, Bitflyer, Kraken (well, when it's working), etc.  Both Gemini and Bitflyer have NY Bitlicenses.

While this may be true GDAX has a much more generous ACH limit of you're a serious trader, you can send $50K in a single ACH.

Essentially you're forced to use wires on Gemini while ACH is more useful on GDAX

Most people control well more than one address, even if you just had a little bit of Bitcoin just spending it generates change addresses with balances and whatnot. So you end up with tons of random addresses over time that are all tied to you.

Sure, but the thing is nobody can sell that March long to you unless they've hedged somehow as well.  At some point someone has to hedge by buying Bitcoin.

I really do have to say that I don't appreciate the antics they're using to trash Bitcoin. If Bitcoin.com wants to promote Bitcoin Cash they should be doing it on the merits of Bitcoin Cash and not shitting all over Bitcoin on TV. It doesn't help either coin if you go on TV and start attacking cryptocurrencies.
Regardless, I think we'll survive this just fine, even if the price isn't what I'd like it to be. Once real scaling solutions are implemented people can finally stop all this stupid FUD and we can resume our rocketship ride. It'll probably need to be some combination of LN and probably a larger block size as well since I can only anticipate use continuing to go up and not down.

To be entirely fair to Ver here, he did also travel around the world prosetylizing about Bitcoin, and he did start doing this before Andreas did. But Andreas was honestly better at explaining it to laypeople I think, and a little bit better at inspiring normal folks to think more about Bitcoin. He also seems to understand the technical stuff somewhat better than Ver or maybe he just explains it better. Ver does seem to behave rather bratty sometimes, though he's not alone in being a rich crypto guy who behaves like an asshat.
At the end of the day, I think both of these guys really did help build the Bitcoin ecosystem up in their own ways, and as Andreas pointed out, Ver did help him get an actual paying job at some point in the Bitcoin world. I'm not a fan of Craig Wright but at the same time I do remember a point when it was pretty much only Ver going around insisting to people that Bitcoin was going to be huge and a revolution when literally nobody in the normal world believed. Even I didn't believe back then, and sold most of my Bitcoins for something like $8 a piece to pay for food and housing since I was very broke, so I know how Andreas feels. I was fortunate enough to realize my errors and when I got a decent enough job I put as much money as I could into it to try and buy what I had sold back.
Very few humans are perfect, I don't think there's any need to insist that one person is a perfect angel and the other an absolute demon. Let's all try to be better to each other and help keep Bitcoin growing.

Satoshi felt that by printing money they were robbing money from responsible folks who had saved up money instead of punishing banks that had irresponsible leveraged and made insane bets on real estate.  Because all the money printed devalued currencies he wanted to create a currency that couldn't be manipulated like that.
As for whether this is good or bad, well I think the viewpoint of folks who support non inflationary money their point is that the debt driven bubbles you see in debt based economies are harmful.  That you get short term economic booms but then the house of cards will come crashing down every now and then and devastate people.  So they basically feel that a slow and steady sort of growth based on savings and only spending when we need to is the right path.  Whether this is true or not is a matter of debate and also a sort of philosophical issue.
That's why you'll see bitcoiners rant against ideas like fractional reserve banking and quantitative easing, etc.
I think that objectively these tools have the ability to affect the economy but they become very addictive, and you can end up in a crazy debt sinkhole over time without good solutions.  Either way I don't think Bitcoin even needs to replace every currency, just existing is sufficient that people can shield some of their money away from the inflationary debt fueled economy.

I dunno, I could use a Tesla Roadster ;) but other than that yeah, I think most millenials are more "down to earth" about money than other generations, there's some studies showing that we spend a lot less money on frivolous things and save more of our incomes.
Honestly if I had $10 million in Bitcoin all I'd do is retire, cash out maybe half and put them into relatively low risk investments-some rental properties in low cost regions, some cherry picked dividend stocks, etc. then I'd let the rest ride. Would allow for a very comfortable lifestyle the rest of my life, and I'd still be spending the rest of my time running some businesses I've invested in, and doing my other work part time.  I'd be able to travel a lot more often though and feel much more financially secure is all.

He donated some, not all.  But generally speaking, people WANT leaders of ideas to have "skin in the game", most investment funds actually require people leading them to put their own money on the line so you're not just dicking around with other people's money-if your clients lose money you should be losing money too.
It's very unusual to see a project leader completely disassociate their own financial future with their product. Literally no business does this, every single business in the world is structured so that they make money when their product succeeds. How does it make sense for a leader of a product to not have a financial stake in it?! A company that makes baseballs makes more money if people really want to buy that baseball, they're not going to go and financially disconnect themselves from the success of their product.
Frankly the reality is that Charlie Lee made a crazy amount of money and decided to cash out. I don't blame the guy, but this insane spin that it's for ethical reasons just doesn't hold any water. If he wants to go yachting or whatever it's his perogative.

New tax year and the first day (1/1) is a holiday so most people are off relaxing, whereas 1/2 is the first day people are back at work. Lower tax rates in the US for short term gains also mean that more people are likely to buy in for shorter term timeframes.
Of course, there's also the likelihood that a lot of folks who've held for less than one year take this time to start cashing in gains, so whether it'll go up or down or just stay neutral is unclear.  But it's certainly possible that a lot of US companies or larger players may have cashed out some longer term gains to get cap gains treatment in 2017.

Just remember when you need to pull the money back out of GDAX there is a pretty significant withdrawal limit, your cash and crypto withdrawals of all types combined cannot pass the limit (which varies depending on your verification), so once your money is in GDAX it will take quite some time to pull your money out.  If you hold very large amounts it can be very problematic and you can find your funds stuck there for days in a row.
I think for long time verified accounts the normal limit is something like $10K, so if you're a rich whale and you deposit $10 million into GDAX it's going to be stuck there for a very long time until they give you a higher withdrawal limit. Even someone with $500K is going to have a tough time pulling out.

It will indeed be one of the biggest bubbles ever, and it will indeed "crash" at some point.  But you're missing the part where it runs up an insane multiple before "crashing" by maybe half, and then proceeding to go on another huge run up again in four years and finally cementing its place as a huge part of the world economy.
So yeah a crash is coming, except it's just as likely to be 50k to 25k as what you're thinking of as a crash.  And then it'll go from 25K to probably 200K in four years.
And then while the believers are driving their Chirons and Tesla Roadsters you'll still be foaming at the mouth about how it was all a bubble. You're not wrong but damn are you missing the bigger picture here.

The thing is that only mining nodes stay on top of the software releases since they care a lot more whether they're mining an invalid fork or not, whereas a lot of people probably run their non-mining nodes on a very cheap VPS or on some old computer that's sitting in a corner and they basically never think about it so they'll probably find out when they happen to read a headline about this.

I gotta tell you, this is why Bitcoin isn't really going to be as commonly used in China, there are already entrenched common payment methods there, and not only is there no fee for payments they pay something like 8% interest on balances held in your account.  Right now if you own Bitcoin in China it's definitely not because it's easier to use or more convenient than WeChat.
For the rest of the world though where there aren't entrenched players like this Bitcoin can be that player, but we do need to achieve good scaling soon or someone else might frontrun us.
I think right now Japan is a very good target for Bitcoin, because they never adopted credit cards en masse, so there's no entrenched credit card habit that stops digital payments from catching on (like in the US, where people continue to use credit cards even though we all have smartphones), and they haven't widely adopted something like WeChat/Alipay like China has. But Bitcoin hasn't really scaled yet to allow for such an adoption, so I am really hoping that we scale in time to manage to get Japan on board with real use as a currency. I think once you get one country really on board more will follow.

Switch computers to a clean one and change the e-mail linked to your Coinbase immediately, make sure both that email and your account have 2FA turned on via Google Authenticator.

I think this is generally good advice since I am seeing a lot of folks posting that their lives are ruined, etc. because an exchange they were trading on wiped them out (which is itself largely due to the users getting greedy and overleveraging themselves and taking on insane amounts of risk).  But overall I don't think it requires existing currencies to have completely fallen apart for Bitcoin to reach $100K-$250K, this is entirely reachable just with a small amount of the big institutional investors moving into Bitcoin, which I really see happening over the next year or two.  For that reason I have not re-balanced out of cryptocurrency, but I have a pretty high paying day job anyway, if that were not the case it would be insane to continue holding the vast majority in crypto.
Now the day it hits $1 million+ is the day that I would start to have serious concerns about the stability of the big fiat currencies.

They do transaction batch, just not all the time, only when it makes sense based on the inputs and outputs. 
At least the moves I've made I've seen other tx's batched with me, I think this is part of the reason why they can afford to cover the fees for GDAX, the Coinbase users paying fees are basically covering a large portion of the tx fee.

Well looking at the payout to Andreas it looks like the person who gifted it got most of the inputs from mining, since almost all the inputs are small inputs of fractions of Bitcoin. People don't usually buy Bitcoin in tiny fractions like that so it's almost certainly a miner.
A very generous miner.
I think you traced it back a little bit too far.
The real problem now is that Andreas has to figure out the damned tax basis for this which is going to be a nightmare.  Being gifted the money doesn't mean that he's off the hook for taxes if the original gifter never paid capital gains on it.

For tax reasons it's best to directly donate the bitcoin instead of selling then donating the proceeds.  Fidelity supports setting us a donor directed fund that allows you to fund it using Bitcoins via Coinbase, and then you can donate the full amounts to the charities.
OP might already know this but if they do not this is the best way to donate all the money and get a tax writeoff.  This is my plan for my own bitcoins at some point though since I do not hold as many as OP I'm gonna defer doing this for another year or two.

Even if they did fully enable segwit it wouldn't immediately accomplish anything. For one thing you can't just suddenly make existing Bitcoins sit in a segwit address without first transacting into a segwit address, who's going to eat that initial fee? If everyone suddenly tried to move their Bitcoin into a segwit address what do you think will happen to the transaction fees!?
To benefit from the segwit discount the Bitcoins must originate from a segwit address, so you have to pay a fee to move the coins into one to begin with.
There also needs to be much better wallet support for segwit, it'd be nice if Core supported segwit change addresses for one thing.
It's only after everyone has moved a ton of Bitcoin into segwit addresses and they start spending from those exclusively that we'll see increased throughput and even then at the current pace of use it's unlikely it'd be enough of a throughput increase to drop the fees down to what people want. We'd likely still need larger block sizes plus LN to accomplish that.

Calm down about that, not every family immediately falls apart with money.
They should only gradually cash out and INVEST the money they do cash out eventually and then spend only the proceeds from those investments though.
Or you'll end up broke again very quickly.
I would suggest anybody suddenly coming into this money who isn't already proficient managing wealth please read the financial independence forums and websites to learn how to manage millions to generate long term income.  A million dollars doesn't go as far as people think, you actually need about 2 million for most normal people to retire early.

Honestly, money can make your life a lot better in a lot of ways but it should never be the most important thing in your life. Even if you're rich it doesn't make you any happier, I've probably been more stressed than ever before after my net worth reached seven figures-I have more work than ever before and more fear about losing what I've earned (not just in crypto).
I think we all see a little bit of OP's brother in ourselves, obsessing about the opportunities we missed out on by the smallest of margins. I had planned on investing in the ETH ico with about 10 bitcoin but missed it due to delays in the ICO and work obligations and I remembered the day after the actual ICO. Then out of bitterness I refused to buy any ETH. That was an 8 figure goofup right there, and similarly I did something like that for the IOTA ICO, and the NXT ICO (which was only 15 bitcoin).
You can always look back and think about how you came so damned close to being worth tens of millions, but what's the point?
I think we all need to take some deep breaths and go talk some nice walks and hikes instead of constantly obsessing over the price of Bitcoin day in and day out. Ever since the price hit 5 figures I've been probably spending 20 hours a week reading about Bitcoin and looking at prices, which is likely not very healthy and I've been obsessing about the things I missed out on by the stupidest of margins and wondering what I would be doing now if I had just made it in time for this ICO or that one.

This actually undervalues Bitcoin heavily though, because once Bitcoin is able to scale it'll be both a store of value and a fully functional currency.  Which makes it far more valuable than gold, since you can use gold as a store of value but you can't hold it for day to day use as a money.
Bitcoin will be both, making it far more valuable than gold.  I personally think we can achieve 100-400K in the medium term (4 years) and long term if people really use it as an international currency it'd be unthinkably valuable, but if it ever got there governments would really fight it since it would undermine their currency and market manipulations.  Of course that's exactly what Satoshi wanted so...

Every single halving to date has triggered a massive, massive, runup in Bitcoin prices is what it means, usually it takes several months after the halving for the impact to really be felt in the price.
Which means if Bitcoin stabilizes at 10-20K in the interim, this next halving could be the catalyst for a run to six figures.  We're talking 100K-500K prices.
It could also be the catalyst for me retiring.

Is it just me or are those fees pretty high? Their demo transaction seemed to have over 25% in fees? I really hope that this isn't indicative of what real world fees are going to look like.  Is it just because they priced the coffees so cheaply or something? Seems to have been a 546 satoshi fee on that second coffee, I can't quite understand what the commit fee is on the first one but maybe that's to open a channel to begin with? So that was like a dollar or so to open the channel and then 7 cents for the second purchase?
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:37:42
That doesn't really force the price down though. In fact, in order to offer any futures on the market, most future contract sellers will likely have to hedge by buying Bitcoin and then charging a premium for the contract, otherwise they risk insane losses if Bitcoin goes on a bull run. It'll basically be professionals offering these contracts because they're tax advantaged versus holding real Bitcoin if you frequently trade (they're taxed 60/40 due to tax laws on futures with 60% of gains being taxed as long term gains even though they're not). So professional traders who trade in and out frequently greatly prefer using futures to do their trading.

@_date: 2017-12-02 05:07:45
I don't think 1) is all that likely short term, most of the big investors are sitting on insane amounts of gains so to clear out of those positions would trigger pretty hefty tax bills that will significantly reduce the total Bitcoin you hold even if you go back and buy futures.  If you're very bullish on Bitcoin still it'd still be better to continue holding the real thing and if you want to cash out a bit you can sell off the futures instead to get paid (and use your existing stockpile to hedge).

While it's possible that it's fiction, most chip producing companies start working on their next generation chip once the current one is taping out, and so far Bitmain has kept up with all the process node changes in the industry so I would seriously doubt that they haven't already been working on a 7nm chip for quite a while.

@_date: 2018-08-11 09:36:09
I don't think you're getting the point of Bitcoin then at all. The problem with your logic is that you're ignoring the fact that this forces you to invest in investments even when you don't think there are any good investments worth investing in, and this causes bubbles to form. And then when the bubble pops as it did in 2008, you lose money no matter what you did. If you kept your money in the bank the increased inflation would destroy it (assuming your bank got bailed out and you live in a country with something like FDIC) and in some countries people had their bank balances only minimally insured. If you kept your money in housing investments we all know what happened to the value of those houses. If you kept your money in stocks they all tanked and many companies went under.
The whole point of Bitcoin was to be a currency that wouldn't be inflated by governments and that wouldn't be prone to causing bubbles from people being essentially forced to invest even when there aren't great investments in a market.

I can see that you've never had to run a business in your life. Businesses can't just HODL and hope the currency maintains it's value, they have to pay payroll, rent, insurance policies, supplies, etc. Expecting every merchant to start a side business as a crypto speculator is plain ridiculous. Only when Bitcoin has achieved a huge valuation and stability of price would merchants be willing to do that, but you won't get there until it's widely adopted so in the meantime you can't expect every merchant to take a loss just to accept it.
I appreciate the business that DO give a discount for using crypto since they're promoting it, but expecting most merchants to ever do this is insane. Shout out to izziban Korean bbq in Orlando btw.

That [Newsweek article from 1995]( let's you know exactly what the problem is with non-believers that dismiss futurist's claims. See, the non-believers see that the internet is disorganized and hard to find relevant data on and they just grumble that it'll never be as good as a library. They see that usenet is cluttered and hard to read so they figure online communities will get more chaotic and unusable as they get bigger. Then they apply this mentality to every other capability that the futurists and dreamers say the internet will have.
What these non-believers don't realize is that the believers are out there building the solutions and building these capabilities into the internet. Information is hard to find? Search engines were invented and in the search engine wars Google came up with a brilliant way to organize the data.  More users leading to a cluttered mess of voices? Well new web forums with nice organization came up and then voting systems like Reddit came up next, turning the chaos of usenet into useful resources. Online shopping and ebooks are hard to use? Well, the believers didn't just give up, they built and built and improved their logistics, distribution, costs, etc. until Amazon is kicking retailers butts. And those paper book stores are almost gone.
And so the believers will build Bitcoin, build crypto, build it into what we claim it will be. The non believers don't get it.

Why don’t you go look up how much this would cost and figure out the fees you’d need to charge even with $0 profit. There’s the cost of the rent, the machine, the internet connection, the exchange fees, the cost of thefts/vandalism, insurance, etc. There’s also the high cost of needing to hire armored security to come and empty out the cash from the machine on a regular basis, do you think armored trucks and security guards are free? 
Regular bank ATMs are subsidized by the bank because the bank makes their actual money off of all the money people deposit, not off the goddamn atm fee. The main reason they even charge atm fees is to convince folks to join their bank.
Bitcoin ATMs will always have high fees no matter what.
The only real way to get the fees down would be if all regular ATMs also offered Bitcoin exchanging as a bonus feature and they gave lower fees to their account holders.

Other people having jobs doesn’t take jobs away from you, because there aren’t a finite number of jobs you idiot. The money that’s paid to them doesn’t disappear into a black hole. They’re mostly poor and have to use virtually all the money they’re making. They have to buy clothing at the local clothing store so the store might need another cashier. They take the bus with the money so there needs to be bus drivers. They buy food at the supermarket so now more people work there. The more people that there are in a country the more jobs there are in that country. How goddamn stupid do you have to be to think that there’s a set number of jobs in the world?! A lot of countries [have garbage economies because their population is shrinking,]( do you realize that?! Because when there’s less people around, there’s less jobs around and less economic productivity and more old and sick and dying people with nobody to take care of them. 
No, I don’t think we should let criminals come waltz through the border to sell drugs, but to moan about immigrants doing hard farming jobs or cleaning toilets in a hotel is legitimately retarded. Almost all the money they get paid stays in the economy and goes to another person who has a job too because they’re spending it you idiot. Do you think immigrants just set all the money they’re paid on fire?
The morons who think economics is a zero sum game need to get their head out of their asses, you don’t understand what money even is or what an economy even is. Do you not fucking realize that if an immigrant comes to the US and works on the farm that we now have more food in the US because the farm worker makes more food than they personally consume? That they then spend the money they’re paid on stuff Americans make and sell? That our economy gets BIGGER whenever someone immigrates here because people who work produce more than they’ll themselves consume. That money is just a points system to make people work and produce? Clearly you don’t get any of those things.

He started claiming there'd be a recession way back in [2004 for completely unrelated reasons to the eventual cause of the recession, and then even during the recession kept predicting further doom and gloom.]( He's nicknamed Dr. Doom because that's basically all he ever predicts.

IIRC he lost a lot to MtGox, but he probably will be much better off once the MtGox settlement is paid out which should be happening pretty soon. Obviously it'll be paid out at the prices at the time and not current prices but he should be much better off once the settlement is done.
Still, I suppose you wouldn't want to work for free forever even if you did get a settlement.
Only thing is that Luke also spends a lot of his time developing stuff that not everyone else in Bitcoin really cares about or wants. Like his node implementation Bitcoin Knots that supports [Tonal Bitcoin]( I really doubt that a lot of people want to give him money to develop that any further.

The price increases are mostly temporary during periods of adoption and wild speculation. But over time as that decreases it should become relatively stable, especially at higher pricepoints where you need a lot of money to shift hands to significantly drop or raise the price. With enough trade volume and a high enough price it’ll stabilize plenty for mass use.
And it was meant more as a hedge against governments inflating money to death than to make you wildly rich. Making people wildly rich is just a side effects during the adoption phase

There have been people doing this for a while, trying to randomly seed addresses with dust. I assume it's to build some sort of tracking system to monitor transactions.
If you're wary about it you can probably use coin control and just skip those inputs when generating any outputs so that their tracking will dead end. It's likely that future upgrades to Bitcoin will make these techniques useless anyway.
@_date: 2018-10-24 02:23:03
None of the above, something like Bitcoin is far better than any of these random assets. You don't know what the future demand for oil will be, especially with people switching to renewable energy so why would you peg yourself to oil? Gold is mined regularly and if people switch to crypto as a store of value it's value will drop, so tying the value of your crypto to it is pure insanity.
You might as well tie the value of your crypto to the horse and buggy.

You make sure that you're not installing some compromised version of the software by checking the hash of the file you've downloaded against what it should be. Of course, you need to make sure that the source for "what it should be" isn't itself compromised.
So in this case BashCo has provided their PGP signature and posted the signatures here on reddit so that you can tell that it's really them posting it, and posting it on reddit is also helpful because it's a different website than the one you're downloading it from, so you can verify that the hashes posted here match the ones posted where you're downloading it from. Optimally this should be the case for all software releases, you'd have the correct hashes posted in numerous places so that it'd be incredibly difficult to compromise.

Outside of investment experts like Buffet and owning shares of your own company, the ultra wealthy actually hold a very large portion of their money in government bonds due to the tax benefits and stability.

Because trade itself allows for increased economic growth. The entire world being one trade block is actually the best case scenario. When you choose not to trade you have numerous countries duplicating effort and wasting resources so everyone’s economy grows slower. For example, imagine if every single nation on the planet decided that they HAD to build their own jet planes from scratch, and that no nation should ever just import and airplane. How much engineering talent, metallurgists, aluminum mining and refining plants, etc. would be needed? How much would this rob from the ability of these countries to create other products?
The reality is that you simply end up with a whole lot of countries that waste almost all their brain power making garbage quality aluminum and garbage quality jet engines. This then takes away the ability of those countries to focus on products that their own natural resources would favor, or developing a niche industry they can be good at. Trade allows everyone to efficiently allocate human effort and all end up having access to everything. If Italy has the best pasta and tomatoes and Taiwan has the best silicon chips does it make sense for Taiwan to try and grow tomatoes on land that’s not meant for it and Italy to try and build chip foundries? Or is it better to just send those Italian tomatoes to Taiwan and send the chips from Taiwan to Italy? It’s pretty obvious that it’s insanity for every country to try and do everything when there are things nations are clearly better suited for or already better at. 
Trade let’s you focus on stuff you’re good at and then swap for the stuff other people are good at so that everyone gets good stuff. Wasting time and effort telling the smartest people in every country to work on the exact same thing is a massive drain on an economy and honestly holds back development.

There most definitely is a relationship, it's just not a direct one. Mostly it's just that very few miners are insane people who will ever sell their mined bitcoins below their mining costs. If that's the case they're better off just shutting off their miners. But most miners don't do that-they'll hoard their coins and only sell when it hits at least breakeven and optimally at a profit. Since all the new Bitcoins coming into existence come from the miners this is a huge part of the new supply going into the markets for sale. Most hodlers don't suddenly sell Bitcoin if they're the true believers who've been hodling for years and years. Someone who's been in Bitcoin since 2011 has no need to go dump most of their Bitcoins all of a sudden. So a huge proportion of the supply of Bitcoins for sale on the markets actually comes from miners.
@_date: 2018-06-28 01:49:12
I doubt that many people actually paid with Bitcoin, I don't think we can insist that merchants support Bitcoin if we only hodl and don't spend any of it.

Ask anybody that's on Bitmain's mailing lists, they sent out e-mails advertising S9i's for crazy cheap prices because they know they're about to be completely outdated.

Seeing as how I'm a fucking physician who's literally dealt repeatedly with keeping people's bodies alive for organ transplants when they've become brain dead, and seen dozens and dozens of other people actually go through the dying process I find it really fucking ridiculous that you're telling me all that matters is "blood and oxygen to the brain". How do you think they declare someone dead to begin with?! It's when you're most definitely not getting any goddamn blood and oxygen to the brain. They're not declaring you dead while you have a good pulse and brain activity from the brain getting good blood flow. The other major issue i was referring to is that as you die it's a gradual process where your body is supplying insufficient blood and oxygen to your organs for hours and hours on end before you finally have no pulse and no brain activity. Which means your failing liver is letting toxins like ammonia build up, your failing kidney is letting other brain damaging substances build up, your blood is becoming severely acidotic due to both organs failing and building up lactic acid without the kidney buffering it with bicarbonate, your lung makes it even worse as you don't exhale sufficient CO2, etc. No goddamn hospital is going to let someone come in and inject and freeze you while you have a good pulse and good oxygen going to a healthy brain, are you completely insane?
You don't know what the flying fuck you're talking about and you're spouting bullshit off to someone who fucking keeps folks alive for a living. Until they let them legally freeze and preserve tou while you're still healthy enough to meaningfully preserve this shit is an outright scam that just preserves a uselessly damaged brain and body.

Your gmail absolutely should have 2FA. And if you're paranoid enough you should also disable the ability to recover your gmail password via your phone # by disassociating the phone # from your account and only using backup codes that an attacker has no way of accessing, because in theory they could still compromise the normal Google 2FA by first compromising your phone account and doing a SIM replacement attack on it.
Also, you should secure your mobile phone plan anyways with whatever the most secure options are for it (PINs, etc.) though this is almost always a point of vulnerability.
Also, don't leave photos useful for verification on your google drive, Jesus. Needless to say don't put your goddamn private keys on there either.
Don't use any password storage plugins for any of this stuff, not only are these plugins reading your damned password entries which is a security risk to begin with (who knows if a plugin gets compromised?) but if the storage company gets hacked you're completely owned.
And finally, keep the majority (90%+) of your funds in cold storage. You can do whatever cold storage setup you like but the cold storage device itself should not have network connectivity. Probably a hardware wallet is the easiest for most people though if you want to go all out and build an underground bunker that works as well. When you do want to trade move the funds you want to sell off in chunks and withdraw them and then move more.
In the crypto world you need to think of what a paranoid person would do and then do something even more paranoid.

There used to be a rule that older coins that hadn't been moved in a long time would be able to qualify to have transactions mined for free, but I believe it was removed to make the fees higher because they felt that a robust fee market needed to develop.

But so many people do this that your average investor that invests in the stock market manages only half the returns that the market itself does. Because while the market just does it's thing the average investor is buying high and selling low over and over.

This is because Bitpay themselves have to pay a fee to sell the Bitcoin you've sent them so they can pay the merchant in USD. You're being purposefully obtuse here and pretending like Bitpay doesn't actually have to pay anything to convert the money to USD. They obviously have to pay their exchange partners whatever the conversion fee is but they also have to send the BTC you sent them to the exchange. That's not a free transaction so what Bitpay chose to do is to charge you the fee for both transactions.
Bitpay has to do this because the price of BTC can fluctuate a lot and they're guaranteeing the company accepting BTC through them a certain amount of dollars.
  
Which means that they pretty much have to get your payment into the next block, then when they receive it they have to get that payment onto an exchange as soon as possible to sell it. Otherwise they'll owe Namecheap $15 while the price of the Bitcoin may have dropped to $13 because it took a while for the two separate transactions to clear. Bitcoin dropped by $500+ within a few hours yesterday, if you don't pay high enough fees to get into the next block a transaction started when BTC was worth $8500 would have taken so long to get onto an exchange that BTC would have been down to $7500 or something. Do you expect Bitpay to be able to stay in business if they have to constantly eat the cost of this scenario?

Yes, basically you had to either be a very incredibly passionate libertarian or cryptoanarchist to have actually poured money in and held it without selling. There were also some very rich people who held for laughs since the money meant nothing to them to sell. The final category is to be one of the folks who forgot they bought Bitcoin until they saw in the news that it was some crazy price.
Everyone else who got it under $1 would have dumped at $100.

Square eats the network fee?
@_date: 2019-06-05 09:52:50
The problem is that Bitpay doesn't want the value of your Bitcoin in USD to fluctuate too much because they're guaranteeing the merchant a certain amount of dollars. So they set the fee so that your tx will be included in the next block or so to avoid not being able to pay the merchants if the value of BTC drops too much. Right now it looks like you need to be paying about 40 sats/byte to get your transaction included in the next block or two.
Then Bitpay charges you another fee on top of that for them to sweep your incoming UTXO along with other payments they've received off to an exchange for them to swap it to USD. So you essentially pay double the fees because they want to be able to do these within a certain amount of time to avoid fluctuation in the price of BTC.
But honestly, there aren't really that many other payment processors for Bitcoin anymore. [Stripe shut down their competing service]( when the fees went super high during the last bubble. The only other processor that will process BTC into USD for merchants was Coinbase but they no longer offer automatic conversion to USD either because of the fluctuation of the price. Instead you receive whatever BTC you receive from the customer and then you move it over yourself to Coinbase to sell. They used to allow automatic conversion to USD like Bitpay did but basically gave up on doing that because of the same reasons.
So for merchants who want to accept BTC but get a guaranteed amount of USD, Bitpay is the only real option. That's why you see merchants accepting Bitpay even though customers get hit with all these fees.
@_date: 2019-06-03 23:57:49
And technically to receive the receiver has to have incoming channels large enough for the payment. So they have to convince someone else to open a channel to them.

Hahaha...I sold most of mine for $8 or less on Gox way back in the day...I remember when you could mine 50 coin blocks with your regular ass home PC :( Could just fire up your GPU miner, connect to P2Pool and get a whole block in a day or two.
I was so happy about all the few hundred bucks of "free money" I managed to mine and sell.
Would have been worth at least a couple of million bucks by now. Glad I got back into Bitcoin but damn I would have had a lot more coins if I hadn't sold all those. Hurts sometimes, lol
@_date: 2019-06-19 09:36:32
Meh...I did buy some during that 2.8%, but I also bought some during much of Bitcoin's other history where it was much cheaper. So by averaging the price I'm still way, way up.

If you gambled it away within days you likely don't owe any capital gains taxes so don't worry about it.  It's only if you held it until it was worth millions then gambled it away that you end up completely screwed.
But yeah, the IRS is gonna have you on that list of people who bought &gt;$20K years ago. If it makes you feel better I'm on that list too because I used Coinbase to pay for a bunch of equipment I was paying for with Bitcoin. So i had no capital gains on those at all since I spent them all, but the IRS is probably gonna go on some hunting expedition for nonexistent profits.  Luckily all this stuff has been documented and I filed business taxes that will sync up with this, but it's still a headache.

This guidance didn't actually change anything...this is what any non insane accountant could have told you.
The IRS left it vague on purpose to allow you to be able to defend a variety of valuations on your taxes but I see idiots demanding concrete fork valuation recommendations...you really do NOT want the IRS deciding that part for you.
If there are no markets at the time of the fork you can make a reasonable argument that there is no value to the fork or a very small value, but you see folks tweeting that the IRS should have put some sort of concrete rule about it. They can't because the IRS doesn't make the laws, they just help interpret it.
Find a good accountant and come up with an accounting method that you can defend under the IRS' own guidance.

Yes the problem is the "will do the job" part, when is that going to happen?  Because it's not just BCH you're competing with, it's numerous other valuable altcoins like Ethereum, Litecoin, etc. that all want to take the place of Bitcoin for payments.
Regular people aren't going to just sit around waiting for Bitcoin to finally implement LN and get fees down, why would your average Joe do that if they could immediately be able to use a crypto as a store of value but also be able to use it for payments?
LN needs to come out ASAP and every wallet needs to be supporting Segwit ASAP, or someone else will eat our lunch.

Depends on how it's interpreted, one could argue that since Bitcoin Cash did not exist until it was created, the value at time of creation was actually $0.00, so you only received an asset with a cost basis of $0 and will pay taxes on sale.  Of course the IRS can argue otherwise, but it's still not clear at this time, until they actually post some damned guidance.

uh...I have more than enough for a lambo and I definitely didn't get in at cents or even a few dollars...in fact I sold everything I mined at $8 to help pay for a GPU and it didn't even cover the entire GPU's cost.
The reality is I averaged in by spending all my spare income on mining equipment and then a big buy when it was in the hundreds already, and paid taxes out of my salary for the mined bitcoins.
But I spent so much that anybody just buying last year would have had almost identical returns.  And I believe Bitcoin still has even more gains to go.
You clearly don't understand or believe in bitcoin or you'd see this.

A big part of the runup is due to bigger merchants adding support.  Bovada is probably the biggest example, since they're a gigantic gambling website.
Segwit2X was being pushed as a compromise by merchants and payment processors since fees were high, so now that it's dead it seems a lot of places are switching support to Bitcoin Cash.

Honestly I got to experience a tiny little bit of the last days of dial up BBSes and they were fairly responsive on these low bandwidth connections because they were just sending text over. This was in the days right before I got a computer and internet at home, so me and my friend figured out that the library would let us dial into a local BBS and that BBS had basic passthrough internet via something similar to lynx (maybe it was lynx?). So it was a very basic text browser but we had internet access for the first time.
I honestly don’t even remember what I looked up with this since the web was so difficult to find stuff on in those days even with a proper browser, but my friend apparently used the internet to find info about masturbation and oddly enough there was already an entire website dedicated to masturbation in existence. This must have been around 1995.
I think the BBS itself was some sort of singles dating board but we mostly just used it to surf this bootleg version of the web lol.

It does not work short term because most bitcoins are not in a segwit address and many wallets and services do not yet support segwit.  This constant repetition that people just need to use segwit is useless because to move their coins to a segwit address they have to move it from a legacy address to begin with, so they're still stuck with high fees.  In fact it's worse because everyone trying to move to segwit clogs up the chain even more.

You need to count room and board for your children, obviously it's a lot less if you can live at home, but there's no way you can both pay tuition and housing and food for a year for $5500 (22K divided by 4).
Also state school tuition varies a lot by state, some states have very pricey tuition while some states pretty much provide free tuition if your grades remain decent.
But honestly, if you go into the right fields student loan debt isn't as big of a problem as most folks think. I'm still paying mine off but I could pay it off in all cash whenever I feel like it even without tapping my cryptocurrencies at all, just have other priorities and I refinanced my loans down to a pretty cheap rate.

Bitmain is supposedly worth $3 billion as a company, but Jihan was just one cofounder.  But that's how much the company is worth, not how many bitcoins he's been paid out already in.  He's almost certainly a billionaire.
Roger's worth at least several hundred million just based on wallets he's used to vote on polls with, but he also has investments in a ton of companies in the Bitcoin space, and might have other cold wallets...so he could be a billionaire too.

This is nonsensical, you could put up another 500,000 BTC nodes and it would do nothing for acceptance of Bitcoin by merchants, acceptance of Bitcoin as a store of wealth, or acceptance of Bitcoin by the public.

How does that stop authorities from going after bigger LN hubs? Bitcoin miners have literally no way of doing any KYC or AML on customers, but large LN providers have to open up a channel with their customers before any transacting can be done and that allows for governments to force a KYC/AML step.
Why is everyone so confident that LN hubs won't be subject to KYC/AML laws? It makes no sense, a large LN hub would be exactly like Coinbase is right now.

Coinbase is valued at [$8 billion]( but your post is making it sound like some tiny company with no funds to back up hacking risks?
The cash balances kept at Coinbase are FDIC insured, and their crypto hot wallets are also insured.
The other thing is that a crypto dedicated firm likely deals with crypto related secured all the time, much more so than a company doing it as a side project.
I happen to like that Square is supporting Bitcoin and I think Cash app has a great future. But I don't think there's any realistic argument that it's the most secure.

One nice thing is that fidelity also support a donor directed fund that you can put in appreciated Bitcoin towards.  So no capital gains taxes and you get a write-off of the full amount.

Most of my Bitcoin income gets run through my LLC anyways, so none of it would have showed up on anything except my schedule K-1, which is what makes this even more annoying-the IRS was arguing that nobody was paying taxes because there was nothing reported on the capital gains form for their personal taxes regarding Bitcoin, but that's a pretty big presumption that people owe taxes. And people can have bought on one exchange and sold on the other, including from defunct exchanges like Mt Gox so the presumption that a transaction was a capital gain is pretty ridiculous.

Obviously it would give more breathing room, but part of the problem is that to switch over to segwit you'd need to move the coins to begin with, which would generate a whole lot of extra transactions if you expected everyone to suddenly all move coins held in the original address format over. Adoption is just going to have to be gradual no matter what, otherwise you'd just make the fees even worse.

It's a 3 way war now, not a 2 sided thing. Segwit2X is backed by the big payment companies and exchanges, while the miners back BCH even though the exchanges don't really back it since they want Segwit2X and Core and second layer dependent companies back 1X.
Even though the miners may have "supported" segwit2X it was really more that it was convenient to support it at the time, what they really want is for BCH to win since it's 100% on chain scaling.

Cash App is not cheaper, [they adjust the buy/sell rates to make money on the purchase so you're just paying a higher price.]( Usually seems to come out to about 1% in fees.
Coinbase ***Pro*** is going to be significantly cheaper for larger purchases since limit orders are 0.15%. If you're just buying $10 worth then 1% in fees isn't going to mean anything, but if you're buying tens of thousands the fees will run into the hundreds.

Larger holders are much more stressed out about the possibility of loss than smaller holders are. It's fun when you turn $3000 into $10,000 but if you already hold millions the hard fork has you sweating bullets about what to do with your holdings. Larger holders can't really sell out of their positions without triggering massive tax bills either so trying sit out the fork can by selling into fiat can destroy your long term returns, but you also don't want to have large losses just because you didn't want to bite the bullet on a tax bill.

Hmm, years ago I figured if we could hit 5% of gold's market cap (putting bitcoin around $25K a piece) that I'd be pretty satisfied.
But at the rate this is being adopted by people as a store of value I'm starting to think that as the percentage of value stored in Bitcoin versus gold rises, it'll continue to rise. Since the more people who believe in it as a store of value, the more that other people will start to believe too.
So now I'm thinking if we ever actually hit 5% or $25K a bitcoin, that 10% would be an easy leap. And once you have 10% it might well continue to run until it eats up maybe even the majority, which would make a $500K bitcoin entirely possible.
Then we still have the possibility that it really is adopted as a currency, though clearly we would need a lot of work on scaling before that's ever possible.
So I suppose what I'm saying is that my original $25K price target is actually very conservative. We could easily reach $50K within 5 years, which would make many early bitcoiners insanely wealthy and even newer purchases reasonably wealthy.

But if it does ever hit $100K I'll sell off 10% of my holdings.

How did you get 21 million bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:13:46
This varies by state because you will pay the full state income tax on capital gains as well.
 
But generally it will be 23.8%, because selling that much at once pushes your capital gains into the 20% capital gains bracket plus 3.8% for Obamacare. Then you'd pay whatever your state rate is, which for higher tax states can be pretty bad.
So basically about 23.8-3x% depending on where you live.
If you wanna lower the taxes you can cash out smaller amounts over many years to drop yourself into the 15% bracket.
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:32:49
To be fair, they're charging these accounts $100K just for setup and then 10 basis points per month in fees which is insane. That's a 0.1% fee every single month for a $10 million minimum, which is $10,000 per month in fees MINIMUM.

You need a large enough spread between your trigger price and the limit to be able to actually sell, but the problem is that if it's flash crashing there may not be sufficient liquidity to sell out entirely if you have a large position.  The problem with setting a non limited stop is that you're contributing to a flash crash and you can end up selling for a fraction of what the real price should be.  A big part of the sudden crash was likely people triggering all these stops while the exchanges went down.

While obtaining the entire blockchain is important for your own node to validate the transactions, there's no good reason to store everything on a live hard drive.  Full nodes can prune down to the last year's worth of transactions or whatever you feel makes the most sense, and you could store the older portions of the blockchain in offline storage, there's no reason to constantly add hard drives to your machine. You don't even have to go buy some fancy tape backup systems or whatever, there's cloud providers that allow unlimited offline backup for very cheap-look up services like Backblaze. Hard drives that sit online don't actually make that much sense for storing large amounts of infrequently used data, you only need to look at the entire blockchain once on your node to validate everything from the beginning, once your node has validated it there's no reason for every node to constantly keep the older data on a hot hard drive.  We would still need some nodes to host all the data for syncing up new nodes, so a *few* people would need to go buy a new hard drive every few years but they have 12TB hard drives now so even that wouldn't be a frequent event (Seagate makes Ironwolf and Barracuda Pro 12TB drives, and [WD just announced a breakthrough that should astronomically improve storage density]( so 20TB+ hard drives should be available soon. WD is predicting that they'll be able to eventually hit 4TB per square inch of hard drive platter space over the next decade so they should be able to eventually scale to something like 100TB in a single drive with 3 platters.
Right now I run a full node but I still prune it down just to keep space usage in check, it stores about a year of transactions.
TL;DR: Not every node has to keep the whole blockchain, but even nodes that want to keep the whole blockchain do not have to constantly add hard drives since hard drive storage capabilities have grown and will grow significantly.

Their cash balances are held in a bank and are FDIC insured though, so once you've sold out of your position you can cash out slowly without worrying that they go bust and take your money with them.
It's when you hold BTC on Coinbase that you're taking a much bigger risk if they get hacked or whatnot, though even then they supposedly have insurance on their cold wallets.  
The withdrawal limits are also different depending on your account, they allow higher limits if you have a ton of money with them, though you basically would have to be a millionaire to get higher than 50K.

But I think this is sort of a weird peak day where all the people who wanted BCH instead of BTC are all buying it at the same time for some reason, it'll probably settle back down to more normal trade volumes as people are done switching over and the price will probably stop running up this aggressively.

The total market cap of Bitcoin is still far too low for the big players to care, that's why it has and will still continue for a while to grow at these crazy rates. The distribution of money in the world is pretty lopsided so it's that top 0.1% of wealth holders that make all the difference, and right now even all the Bitcoin together isn't valuable enough to be something that interests them.
I think when we hit a $50K Bitcoin we'll actually start getting more interest from the real ocean of money out there. And then once those folks buy in then I see the price sort of stabilizing and capping out but we're still very far from there.
I actually think with all the stuff on the horizon bitcoin may actually be underpriced still.

The problem is that there just isn't high quality support for segwit addresses yet, not only do a lot of wallets not support the addresses correctly, you also lose out on a lot of forks due to these issues (for example you can't claim Bitcoin Gold if your coins were held in a segwit address due to a technical issue) as well as a lot of airdrops due to the fact that you can't easily sign from a segwit address to prove you own it. So right now there's just too many negatives to holding funds in a segwit address. You'll even see some core devs like Luke-Jr [telling folks not to use segwit until LN is ready](
I personally don't keep anything in a segwit address because of these issues right now, since I need to be able to sign for airdrops and to split my coins if any further forks occur.  The savings in transaction fees are minimal compared to being able to split out these forks.

Brother, before you do ANYTHING please learn how to properly manage your money.  You and your wife likely have not developed those skills especially if you're living paycheck to paycheck.  Plus you were planning on buying a $350k house which is actually pretty high for your income level.  I have a similar net worth and a combined income about 6x yours and I'm looking at buying around $500k...
You don't quite have enough to retire right now, because the taxes on this are pretty high if you cash it out all at once.  And if you slowly cash out you do run the risk of the price fluctuating greatly.
I would **STRONGLY** suggest reading r/financialindependence and r/personalfinance first to get some ideas of how to manage your money and what investments to make with such a large sum of money to provide a STABLE and steady stream of income long term.  People often think a million dollars is a ton of money but you're forgetting that to make it last a long time you can only really touch a portion of the gains or you kill the goose with the golden eggs.
For what it's worth I haven't cashed it out either, have less btc than you but a few successful altcoins.  But my day job pays much better so I'm holding out for a bigger long term payday.  If I was in your situation I'd be a lot more tempted to start cashing out as well.
As for the wife....she could probably make a good claim to half the rise in price if you bought it after you got married.  I wouldn't try to secretly hide it and divorce her though, if she finds out later you can be sued and not only owe half but owe penalties for trying to hide it.  And it's pretty hard to hide being a millionaire long term lol

Hashrate will go back towards what it was but the price pressure against BTC will continue as multiple large miners will mine whatever is most profitable but sell their BTC for BCH.  And they'll keep trying to shift the price of BCH up.  They won't be able to keep pumping it up 60% per day since even the super wealthy miners have limits to their holdings but don't assume that their attempt to move over hashrate is over anytime soon.
The other issue is that while core has good support in the English speaking world, in China and Korea their Bitcoin heroes are heavily the miners.  Their newspapers and media regularly cover these guys as the geniuses who make Bitcoin work so they're seen as the good guys.

Assuming continued successful adoption and people at least seeing it as a store of value, I see Bitcoin at $50-100K by 2021 after the next halving.

Hmm, it appears that Ledger was able to [fix the issues]( and Trezor also built support though from what I understand software wallets like [Coinomi that support splitting BTG don't support segwit addresses]( So only folks who already had their wallets in the format for a Trezor/Ledger can use a hardware wallet to split from a segwit address. Everyone else is still unable to claim. Either way it's hard to know when or whether you'll have proper support (though it does seem like the hardware wallet teams are doing a pretty good job even if it may take them some time), and you still can't participate in airdrops that use signatures to claim (like Bitcore BTX/Byteball). I think you'll continue to see a relatively low percentage for segwit adoption until more wallets correctly support segwit addresses and everyone agrees on an address signing standard for segwit-there's several possible ways to do it but none are really supported yet.

It's not scummy, a properly run business needs to employ as much price discrimination as possible to obtain maximum revenue. Oftentimes selling largely the same product at multiple price points with only minor differences is the best way to do this.  Especially for an upstart in a hard industry like Tesla getting every last dollar is important.

These are the small ATM machines you see at convenience stores and gas stations across the world, not the big machines that banks use.  So the only question is whether convenience stores and gas stations are willing to update software to increase the amount of money they'd make...it's a no brainer for store owners.
Normally they only make a tiny amount since most ATM fees are like $1-2, but Bitcoin fees tend to be much higher so they would LOVE this feature.  I can't imagine an owner not turning this on.

You just need to configure it to run on mainnet, the current version runs on mainnet just fine. 
It's still missing some features that would make it more useful though, like some way of controlling transaction fees. Zap just randomly decides on a transaction fee for channel opens and closes and you have zero control over it. Which is fine on testnet but results in bizarrely volatile fees on mainnet, even when the blocks are pretty empty it seems to pick wildly different fees.

He's for proper regulation of Bitcoin instead of every state coming up with their own crackpot draconian rules that have kept New Yorkers from being able to access most of the exchanges at all. Wyoming's framework is very pro-crypto so I don't know why everyone keeps trying to make it sound like he's trying to promote things that'll hurt Bitcoin.
It's better that there's limits on regulation instead of what it is right now where every state can come up with ridiculous rules.
What I want at this point is regulation that gets rid of the very problematic capital gains issues for Bitcoin. Right now we're stuck with Bitcoin being very difficult to use because of the tax issue so any step towards reasonable regulations that'll make Bitcoin fully usable is a good thing in my opinion. We already have to file crazy taxes with the most conservative and most rigorous possible interpretation to avoid the IRS kicking down the door, so the lack of regulations does not help us. All it does is get the IRS to accuse you of being a tax cheat even though they've given terrible guidance.

Lightning on mainnet honestly is not quite ready for a huge merchant like Square to just roll out publicly yet.

Especially during a bear market like this where flaws are scrutinized and overhyped by the FUDers.

What you're not realizing is that a lot of very large whales are pumping BCH for this exact reason.  They're going to try and pump the price so high that the new algorithm favors mining BCH.  
But that's impossible you say, they're not the economic majority!  Except you're forgetting that the folks backing BCH include the largest miners who have hoarded most of the bitcoins mined over the last several years and they're backing going on exchanges and dumping huge amounts for BCH.  Everyone here keeps posting about fake trade volumes but fake volumes don't push the price up several hundred percent in a few days, nor does it push BTC down.  The reason BTC keeps dropping and BCH keeps going up is that the large miners are selling their stashes of BTC to push the price down and pump up BCH so when their new difficulty algorithm begins they have the upper hand.
In a day or so when the difficulty jumps 50% they'll have pumped the price up another 50%

Should have really been written SNs and not SNS. It was screen names, you used to put your AOL/AIM screen name in your profile and it'd be a common way to contact your classmates on Facebook since there was no messaging system yet. It wasn't until much later that pokes and messages were added. There wasn't even a feed or wall in the very early days, so it was literally a contact directory and sort of friend directory.
I was on Facebook back in 04-05 when it first started and there were tons of glitches that basically made everyone's info available to everyone else. The first limitations they put up were to just limit your profile to your friends, but they forgot or were too lazy to actually implement the same limitations for the mobile phone SMS system they briefly implemented...so everyone's profile including their phone  screennames, e-mails, etc. were available to everyone else if you just bothered to use the SMS system.
Anyways, the original Facebook was a lot like Friendster, except you could put stupid shit in your profile about your interests and a relationship status.
In all this silliness, I have to say that I kind of miss AIM. You could go home and log on and chat when you wanted to, and when you didn't feel like it anymore you'd just log off. Made conversations much more immediate too because anybody signed on really did want to be online to chat, whereas now with texts/imessages/whatsapp people may or may not be near their phones and may or may not want to be chatting. So you had much more legitimate conversations that flowed much more like a real phone conversation. Which is of course another thing nobody does anymore.

At $100 the security of your channel becomes a serious issue because then you'd need to have a massive balance in every channel you have for there to still be security since it relies on you being able to penalize the other party by taking all funds in the channel. But if you're forced to eat massive fees to penalize the other party a tiny amount, then financially you may be better off ignoring small amounts of fraud. If they rip you off by $5 do you ignore the incorrect channel state or do you close the channel and eat the $100 fee immediately when you could wait for fees to go down before closing the channel and choose to eat the $5 loss?
It would heavily disincentivize people to open channels, and this would cause serious issues with incoming liquidity. No business would be able to accept LN because to accept incoming payments someone else has to open up a channel to you with balances that can be moved to your node. But if those incoming channels are $100+ in fees per channel how is a business supposed to accept LN affordably?
I think it would still work at $10 on-chain fees, but I can't see it working in it's current state with $100 fees-it would end up being so expensive to accept Bitcoin over LN that nobody would do it. You'd have to constantly pay for incoming channels unless you were willing to huge sums to a single incoming channel which is a security issue of it's own since these are all hot wallets.
I also just don't ever see normal people being willing to open up a lightning wallet if it cost them $100 to open one single channel. To get good routing both ways you typically need several channels, who's going to be willing to pay $200-$500 to use Lightning Network as an end user?!
Do you actually run your own full node and LND? Because it sounds suspiciously like you're talking about LN without actually having used it. Run your own node and try to accept payments like you're a business and then come back and tell me $100 fees per channel would totally work.

This is how it is every bullrun. It attracts people to the space and while the bear market takes its time to drag out people are working hard to build up the ecosystem and make Bitcoin better than ever.
Then when the next bull market rolls around people are like "WOW, there's so much infrastructure and innovation around Bitcoin!" 
The hard work is done during the bear markets where you have to stick it through with your belief that Bitcoin is going to win and win hard in the end, keep your head down and support building up what we need to make it better than ever. That way when everyone else realizes it we win harder than ever before.
I think this is the real reason why every bull run has brought in higher highs. It's because the ecosystem is that much more impressive and robust each time.
At some point the bubbles will probably calm down, once the infrastructure is already superbly robust and handling tons of transactions. But we're probably 2 more crazy bubbles out from that lol.

Then your channel is no longer secure or usable. Which is why solutions to get the size of transactions down for closing/securing channels in LN is important, and while LN is still heavily dependent on fees staying low on the mainnet for now until there's more efficient ways of managing channels. That's why I have to wonder how the hell guys like Carvalho @ Bitrefill think it makes sense to drop to a 300kb block size and just "use lightning network" for everything, because LN would be unusable right now with 300kb block sizes since the fees would make all the small channels worthless. Either Carvalho doesn't actually understand how LN works (which is really bizarre since he's implementing and relying on it heavily) or he's trying to fuck up the network on purpose.
It's going to take time to optimize LN to use less block space and we'll have to probably batch a bunch of broadcasts together for it to make financial sense if fees go significantly higher.
@_date: 2019-04-20 02:58:51
I think this rebuttal is good, but we have to keep in mind that a lot of the solutions mentioned here do not yet exist. Splicing, channel factories, the ability to refill channels, etc. do not exist yet. I think the anti-LN folks are wrong in that they seem to think that LN's flaws today are some kind of permanent state, which is silly. But the folks calling for businesses to all accept LN right now and to decrease block sizes are just as silly-it's just not practical right now because there's too many issues with liquidity and if on-chain fees ran up right now it'd cause a cascade of problems.
We're probably still ~2 years out from LN being really viable for the bulk of Bitcoin transactions. Static channel backups is a good step, and watchtowers should be available soon which will be a big boost to security. But for LN to really be robust enough to allow for huge massive scaling and for the majority of BTC payments to run through it is still something that's years of work away. The best thing we could do as a community is to heavily fund development of LN so we can get the scaling solutions in place as soon as possible, so that if a big bull run hits after the halving in 2020 LN will be ready to go which will give us our best shot at true global adoption (people love to buy during ridiculous bull runs regardless of whether or not it makes any sense so we have to take advantage of that).

What he means is the supply of new Bitcoins, many of which are sold to pay for mining costs (hardware, electricity and warehousing).

My issue with custodial LN is that it rather ruins the point of having LN as a second layer. Like if everyone ended up using a bluewallet or cashapp (when they add LN) then it’s just choking to become like Coinbase’s internal transactions. Bakkt is also proposing some kind of internal ledger that’ll act as a second layer. Maybe a combination of different solutions will take load off of mainnet but I really hope someone comes up with a proper second layer that’s more easily entirely non-custodial.

That advice is wildly dangerous. There is a way to get 0% capital gains but it requires holding it for a very long time. It doesn't matter how Puerto Rico treats personal property taxes, it matters how the Federal government treats personal property and in their law allowing the Puerto Rico tax savings it sure as heck doesn't say that you can just suddenly move there and owe no capital gains at all.

For smaller amounts or lower priority movements exchanges may not even need a federated side chain at all. They can just settle the net transfers once a day, instead of having 5000 transfers one way and 5000 transfers the other way all going over the blockchain.
Like if 500BTC gets sent from coinbase to kraken and 501BTC gets sent from kraken to coinbase over a day they really just need to settle 1BTC that day. If it's not a high priority transfer and users are willing to wait a day for this net transfer to occur that would remove a ton of transactions off the chain. It's actually a little silly right now because you can have a user send 1btc one way while another user does the exact opposite and you just end up with unnecessary UTXOs.
For faster moves of larger amounts between exchanges then you'd need to use Liquid or something similar since there'd be a real shift in Bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-04-04 07:00:57
I use LN myself but it’s not ready for mass use, not unless you completely give up and ask everyone to use custodial wallets and leave channel management to a bank which is just wrong imo.
Not to mention that to really use LN you need numerous open channels for outgoing and incoming payments to ensure reliable routing, so just getting reliably started in a bull run where on chain fees are high will end up clogging up the network even more. People are also less likely to open up incoming channels to your node if fees are high (right now if your node is public other nodes will open up channels to you to improve network liquidity).
But none of that is even the real problem. The real problem is that your channel funds won’t be secure anymore if the mainnet fees are too high, because security is based on being able to broadcast the correct channel state if someone tries to scam you. If the fee is $5+ and the scammer scammed you of $5 there’s no security because you end up losing that money anyways, and many wallets may not even have enough on chain funds to pay the fee to close the channel.
For the security model for LN to continue working mainnet fees have to be lower than what people can scam you for.

It would be a completely offline machine, no wifi card, no ethernet port. You keep your private keys on there on verified software and sign transactions that you then bring over to an online machine. You can do this with Electrum.
Obviously some sort of *nix OS.
Encrypted disk of course, well protected passphrase. Etc. 
Of course, it's like 1000x easier to buy a hardware wallet lol.

I'm a bit annoyed at veriblock eating up a third of the network endlessly, though I guess they're footing the bill so we'll see how long this can last for. When the price of BTC goes up to $100K+ I don't know how long they're going to be able to keep this stupidity up.

I think this will play out pretty organically. Once the next halving for each blockchain occurs it'll become pretty clear which security model actually makes sense. Low fees aren't any good if there's nobody to secure your blockchain and without the block subsidies there's no security for a chain with no fees.
The hard part though is keeping appropriate fees needed for a secure chain while keeping the blockchain usable. During big bull runs where everyone and their grandmother is going nuts trying to buy into Bitcoin and moving Bitcoin all over the place it's going to be very hard to keep fees low enough that LN will still function properly as a second layer. If fees go insanely high smaller LN channels will become entirely insecure. But this isn't something that's easy to solve.

It does work that way, though it's not really half your shit anyways. It's half the shit you acquired during the marriage, whether it's money, houses, cars. Most premarital assets are safe but you have to prove they were premarital.
But an amicable divorce usually means you can come up with a chop up that both people would be happy with. Much cheaper to do it on friendly terms than to waste money on lawyers. Most of the time divorce financially ruins people because both parties are stubborn and want to use lawyers to attack each other...lawyers charge $500 an hour so that's what ruins you.
If your spouse makes more than you you'll likely come out on top so if you're really that worried just marry up financially lol.

If you’ve only opened an outgoing channel you cannot receive anything.  You need to either spend money via that channel, at which time you’ll be able to receive the same amount you spend (barring routing issues) or you need other nodes to open a channel to you with money on their side.
If you make your node connectable (forward ports and announce your IP) I’ve found that people will open incoming channels to you pretty quickly. I don’t think forcing yourself to spend money really makes sense lol.
@_date: 2019-04-20 02:35:34
There are a lot of technical loopholes for a large company to take LN Bitcoin. It'd be a pain in the butt to get enough incoming liquidity to run an actual business and you'd have to constantly spend time obtaining more incoming liquidity whenever enough people have bought stuff from you. Smaller companies may be able to manage it due to there not being that much in sales but if you're accepting tens of millions of dollars a day it'd be a nightmare trying to constantly make sure you have the ability to actually accept incoming payments. Otherwise customers will just get error messages and be pissed.
It's just not technically feasible for companies to accept LN right now and even the payment processors would have a hard time doing it without charging insane fees.
@_date: 2019-04-03 10:47:24
Question is if the fees really run up if the security model of having to pay more fees to close the channel will make sense. You’d need a pretty large channel for it to be worth closing then.
So far it seems like a new LN wallet realistically needs to open at least a few channels to get reliable outgoing routing. You also need incoming channels if you want to receive meaningful amounts, so there’s usually like 5-10 on chain transactions before a LN wallet is really robustly connected.

I do think Layer 2 solutions make the most sense, but at least with LN in the state it is right now we're still going to require a larger Layer 1 blocksize to really onboard people. Now, if we come up with more efficient methods of getting people into LN *without* resorting to heavy custodial service usage then the blocksize could probably stay as is. But right now if some bullrun really hit and everyone tried to rush into LN the fees would probably go insane and cause serious security issues for LN. The security of LN channels relies on being able to broadcast the latest channel state onto mainnet but you can't really do that if the fees are high enough that it would outweigh the losses in your channel, since you'd be paying more money to prevent loss of a smaller amount. So if fees went to $20, anybody could scam you for something less than that on LN and there's little you could do to stop them except to pay the layer 1 tx fee just to spite them.
At least for now, fees would have to be somewhat cheap in order for LN's security model to function correctly.
But I don't think you would need too much of a block size increase to support plenty of LN onboarding anyways.
@_date: 2019-04-06 04:57:20
Basically they're piggybacking the security of their other blockchain to Bitcoin's own PoW security by publishing hashes of their blocks to the Bitcoin blockchain. In theory if they do it right, they just need to pay a small amount of Bitcoin fees but essentially gain the entire security of the Bitcoin's PoW. The only downside is that right now they're taking up way too much space on the Bitcoin network.

No, it’s payments from a segwit address, not to. The cheapest to pay from are native segwit addresses. Still, a lot of people have held off on converting for various reasons. For example if you like to collect stupid forks and dump them most forks don’t understand native segwit.

The whole point of Bakkt and this partnership with Microsoft and Starbucks is that they're going to make it much more usable. Of course part of this is just that they're going to run all these smaller coffee transactions over their futures based platform as a second layer, so none of this stuff goes on-chain. So all your smaller coffee purchases will be like a NYSE stock trade essentially, with a big bank [holding your shares in street name]( and settling the sum of all these trades with each other. People think that every time they tell their brokerage to go buy and sell 5 shares of Amazon or whatever that the banks are actually running out there and swapping these shares with the selling bank but the reality is that they don't actually do that. They just keep track of the sum of all the trades from every customer, then the big banks will settle up with each other once in a while and trade actual stock certificates for hundreds of thousands of shares at once.
So the NYSE is probably more familiar than anybody else with the idea of batching up all these smaller transactions and only performing the summed up larger transaction "on chain", while managing a ledger tracking the smaller transactions. Because that's how all stocks are actually traded-the banks that trade stocks already work as a 2nd layer solution themselves to help scale it because it's not practical to go and issue 5 million stock certificates for tiny numbers of shares then running around and trading those with each other. They just keep their own second layer ledger that they settle with large trades on a regular basis.

Sure that's the negative for daily use today, but the real use cases for Bitcoin aren't what you're describing. Imagine a worldwide accepted currency that doesn't involve you needing to exchange any currencies. You could do that with Visa and convert it but the fees are much heftier for international transactions and they skim extra money off the exchange rate. But more problematically is if you're from a country where you can't even get a Visa card, or if you do get a Visa card but your own base currency in your country isn't stable enough to allow easily paying for it. Then you just use your Bitcoin and sidestep all these issues.
I think people in the US who mostly hold relatively stable USD are forgetting that elsewhere there's a real need for Bitcoin.

It somewhat does, if nobody is using it as a currency or a payment network it's less likely to be seen long term as something with consistent value. If it's purely speculative for the sake of just speculation then the price won't ever achieve stability or reach the highs it could with use as a currency. Far as I know there are no speculative assets that maintained long term value without some other use that underpinned it. Even gold has multiple other uses that made it seem valuable before people saw it as a store of value. What makes Bitcoin valuable is the secure distributed global network underpinning it and the more places that accept and use Bitcoin the more valuable it is because it's utility increases. Currency you can't spend anywhere is less valuable than currency that's accepted globally.
@_date: 2019-04-11 02:39:12
For this to really work they'd need to control a very large amount of hashrate themselves. So keeping mining well distributed would help counteract this.

It's honestly not surprising that they backed segwit2x, they wanted the core developers to go with segwit2x to avoid the mempool backlog that were causing a lot of payment failures and the very high fees. I think they were just very panicked about that situation since their entire business model depends on the payments going through with a low fee and in a reasonable timeframe. Obviously segwit2x ended up being a buggy mess but from what I can tell they originally wanted the core developers to embrace the block size increase, not for someone else to code segwit2x.
I don't think it's realistic for everyone to expect businesses to not basically push for things that benefit them. The ecosystem as a whole will decide what makes the most sense but everyone is free to support what makes sense to them.

That's the thing though, Starbucks offers a ton of different coffees so saying this just makes you seem ignorant. You can pick all sorts of coffees made all sorts of ways at Starbucks. If you don't like the pike's place coffee you can request any of numerous other coffees and they'll brew it however you want. Cold brew, Clover, pourovers, etc. Certain coffees are only available at specific times of the day since they're not commonly ordered so they can't just keep a ton of weird stuff sitting around during less busy times, but Starbucks doesn't just sell burnt coffee. Maybe it's expensive and overpriced coffee but their consistency and availability is why they're so successful.
If you live in a less populated area the Starbucks there may not brew as many varieties just because it's not cost effective to grind up a ton of expensive weird coffees that nobody will order, but in busier areas they almost always have 4-5 different coffees to pick from.
@_date: 2018-11-29 10:21:38
Starbucks is a partner and I also believe an investor in Bakkt though, that's why you see [stuff like this on Starbucks' own website](
I don't think Bakkt is making any false claims, it'd be pretty goddamn weird for Starbucks to partner with a Bitcoin exchange and post PR releases all over their website about how they're going to help people convert their Bitcoin to spend at Starbucks.
Basically I think the only thing that isn't going to happen is that Starbucks isn't going to directly accept and hold Bitcoin itself. They'll be converting it to USD or something similar. But nonetheless you'll end up being able to pay for Starbucks with Bitcoin all around the world. If nothing else for it to be accepted at every Starbucks worldwide is a big add for retail locations. Starbucks already has their own in house digital payment system for their own coffee shops but it gets pretty complicated for international payments so I could see them using Bakkt and Bitcoin to underpin international payment swaps for their own stores in the long run in addition to just accepting Bitcoin at their stores.
Maybe in the very long run we can convince them to accept Bitcoin as Bitcoin but that'll require some regulatory changes and a more stable Bitcoin price.

They're still the largest Bitcoin payment processor, Coinbase seems to have backed out of focusing on that role and Bakkt isn't out yet.

You're confusing a hold with an actual charge...Amazon just places holds to authorize that amount of charge to go through later, but sometimes this can show up twice.
What you need to do is to stop using a debit card and use an actual credit card with a large enough credit line. That'll prevent these holds from mattering since they are not actual charges.
The hold will automatically drop in a few days anyways, you likely don't need to do anything. I remember when this would really bother me because I only had just enough money in my bank account to cover one purchase of something, but the solution is to never use a checking account debit card.

No major merchant will take BTCPay since they can't immediately convert to the currency of their choice. In the real world merchants don't want to speculate on currency and they have to pay taxes on the fiat value of their sales so they have to use a processor that does the conversion.

IANAL or an accountant, but based on discussions with my rather well educated accountant, it has to do with whether the IRS considers there to be robust and real USD markets that would allow it to be easily exchanged for USD. 
There aren't really any legitimate stock market type markets where stuff like warcraft gold is exchanged directly for USD, you're just linking to random websites where they themselves are setting a specific exchange rate, but that's not a real, liquid, USD market like the stock market is.
It all has to do with whether the IRS considers you to have had something called ("constructive receipt")[ So if you get some points in a video game or whatever, even though some crazy people out there might be willing to buy those points or in-game currencies from you from a website or on ebay, because it's not generally considered easily and steadily exchangeable and usable as cash now or in the future it's arguable that you didn't have any actual receipt of funds.
So basically at the end of the day you get taxed on Bitcoin because there *are* robust markets and great liquidity for Bitcoin such that you can easily go swap it for money. And there's obviously a market price every single day for it for you to easily calculate how much you received in USD value, there's even a market price every minute and every second. And because there are such robust markets, if you mine bitcoin or otherwise earn Bitcoin you have construct receipt of income.

It's really not that easy for these big exchanges to do this quickly. Any changes that affect how they store Bitcoin can't be done without an incredibly long risk analysis process from their insurers. These exchanges insure their wallets and insurance companies only insure them after they've undergone very extensive security analyses. If they up and just swapped everything about how they store and send Bitcoin they'd lose their insurance.
They'd rather just eat huge fees instead of giving up their insurance.

Starbucks runs one of the most popular retail digital wallets in the world. Their own Starbucks cards and app are re-loadable at any Starbucks or online and usable internationally at their locations in any country. It actually makes a lot of sense from that perspective since they're very familiar with using scannable codes on phones to allow digital payments.
I actually think they were the first major chain to ever adopt mobile app payments. In recent years you've seen companies like McDonalds or Burger King come out with their own mobile apps that allow payment through the app, but Starbucks has been doing this for many, many, years now and they're one of the only stores that processes the payments internationally. So you can load your Starbucks card here in the US then go to Canada, France, the UK, etc. and buy a beverage with it.
Starbucks themselves would probably save a lot of money on exchanging USD for CAD or GBP or EUR by implementing a BTC based exchange backend.

I'm not gonna BS, it's a terrible idea to buy Bitcoins on credit cards-the fees are sky-high and obviously you should be speculating with money you actually have and can afford to lose.
Don't get me wrong, I've been there and done stupid leveraged bets using 0% credit card balance transfer that I had deposited into my bank accounts years ago when the rules were very lax. And it blew up in my face when the markets crashed in '08. Luckily I could cover the losses but it put me in a bad place for several years before I recovered. I was a young guy and did a lot of stupid shit financially back then, don't be like the dumbass younger version of me.

Until the fees are predictable and stable this isn't really helpful, no businesses are going to want to build on top of a system where the fees wildly fluctuate and randomly skyrocket and then tank, and most normal people won't put up with this either so it's going to hurt adoption.

Yes, I'm really getting tired of this whole infighting between "tribes" in the crypto world. The reality is it's still us versus the entire rest of the financial world-we're still TINY and weak and trashing each other just helps others attack us.
This doesn't mean we don't point out scams or criticize bad actions but painting companies and projects as *EVIL* or whatever nonsense and demanding boycotts every other day is counterproductive.
When we think Coinbase is being stupid not batching transactions or not implementing Segwit we should demand it, but that doesn't mean constantly posting crazy nonsense about how we have to boycott this or that or that they're scammers-people outside this space will see this and think Bitcoin is full of crazies and unreliable.
When we see Coinbase release Bitcoin Cash is an unbelievably idiotic way that pumped the price to artificially high prices (clearly idiotic), constantly posting about "insider trading" with zero evidence and demanding everyone investigate Coinbase for fraud or whatever nonsense just makes the entire crypto world look bad. When non-crypto people see these accusations they'll think that the entire crypto world is full of shady insider trading when in reality it's just Coinbase botching a launch horribly. Even if you hate Bitcoin Cash posting unverified nonsense about "insider trading" this and that just makes us ALL look bad, and it brings a ton of regulatory overhead too.
Please, let's all remember we're still in this together, and we need people to take us ALL seriously. If there are problems we need to bring them to light but making crazed foaming at the mouth accusations left and right does NOT help things and you're just giving ammo to our enemies-you know, like the congressmen backed by the big banks that want to completely shut down the crypto world. If you want those people to win then keep posting this hyperbolic nonsense-if you want crypto to succeed cut this out.

That's not what I was saying, I was pointing out that since he said that he had $0 in other income, that he probably doesn't owe taxes anyways because $4000 isn't enough income to trigger income taxes. Someone making $4000 a year is making less than the poverty line cutoff in the US. [You're not even required to file any taxes at all until you make over $10400]( unless you're someone else's dependent.
Now if he is someone else's dependent then various interest income and capital gains may actually push him into a tax filing required category since the limits for those are very low, but if he truly has zero other income (meaning no interest or other capital gains) it's still likely that he wouldn't owe taxes.

They're dealing in PHYSICALLY DELIVERED BITCOIN FUTURES which is essentially real Bitcoin, it just takes one day to get the Bitcoin delivered. It's about as close to real Bitcoin as you can get. 
The benefits of offering it as a futures product are huge for investors though. Futures get taxed much more preferentially than other products, getting [60/40 tax treatment](
Which means trading Bitcoin delivered in one day as a future results in WAY lower taxes than going on Coinbase or Kraken and directly trading Bitcoin there.
They're going to be huge once they launch, just the tax savings is enough to sway virtually all the US traders over to Bakkt.

lol, the recordings that explain that Tether is exactly what they've always said it is...and have been publicly available on youtube this entire time are now suddenly recordings that "bitfinex doesn't want you to hear" because Bitfinexed needs to go crank up the FUD.
Yes, Tether is problematic because they have to basically put these funds into random bank accounts across the world without ever acknowledging what these funds are for-that's problematic because if governments find out where and what these accounts are for they can pressure the banks to freeze the funds and shut them down since the tokens don't really follow normal AML rules. Of course legally the money and the tokens aren't the same thing, which is basically what Tether/Bitfinex is counting on-the money never actually moves while the Tethers do, so their argument will basically be that there's no need for that level of AML/KYC. The problem here is that it's hard to unwind Tether, because it's hard for them to move out those sums of money to people without hitting some serious questioning with their banks.
But we all knew this, and those are legitimate criticisms of tether. Bitfinexed suddenly posting this nonsense as if it's some brand new information is ridiculous.

It would definitely bring stability, because the total value would be greater and the amount of money needed to shift the pricepoint would grow as well.  True adoption as a currency also gives a legitimate price floor to the value as well unlike a purely speculation driven "store of value" system. 
A good example is gold, it's used for speculation and as a store of value/anti-inflationary asset, but it's industrial and jewelry uses help to stabilize the price and underpin it. Similarly, being actually used as a currency will improve the stability as a store of value for Bitcoin because it adds a use case that stabilizes demand.
Unfortunately this is a bit of a chicken and egg problem, since people won't really adopt it as a currency until it's relatively stable, but it won't be that stable until it's a currency.

Maybe people want to claim a bunch of the airdrops of altcoins? Some alts require you to keep coins in a non-Segwit address to collect anything. For the stellar lumen airdrop, byteball airdrop, bitcore airdrop, etc. you had to have Bitcoins in regular Bitcoin addresses you can sign from. Moving it to a segwit address would mean that you couldn't collect these airdrops unless you moved it back over to a traditional address for the airdrop dates.

A futures based ETF won't really moon the price though since it's based on futures and won't hold any actual Bitcoin.  It'll essentially be a contract whose price mimics that of Bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-11-05 05:18:12
That does seem to be a real risk if a fee spike would trigger channel closings that would just further a backlog and trigger further fee spiking that would trigger even more channel closings. Nobody would actually be able to close their channels in this sort of scenario.
Presumably everyone would just have to be ready to up their required fees at any given time to keep up with the required transaction fees to avoid this scenario, though it would make opening a reliable channel much more expensive if you have to set aside enough extra BTC to cover possible fee spikes.

Well, it used to be that folks who wanted to spread the word would just buy and then use Bitcoin, but two things made this difficult.
The first is that the tax laws don't really favor this-there are ways around it by tracking lots and spending only the most recent "lot" of Bitcoin, but it's obnoxious and you do risk the IRS challenging your tax basis, at least in the US.
And the second is that fees rose high enough in recent months that people really stopped spending Bitcoin as a way to spread the word. Instead folks mostly just held it as a speculative instrument.
I think Bitcoin can only be a good store of value if it's not just a speculative instrument though, it needs widespread use as a currency to keep it's value stable, because a value largely propped up by speculators will be heavily volatile and unstable even long term. It's only when it's more widely used as an actual currency that we'll ironically see it become a stable store of value. Gold is not a good analog here because gold's use in industrial applications as well as jewelry use provides a level of stability to it's price-it's **NOT** priced solely by speculators. For Bitcoin it's use as a payment network and actual currency provide that "second use case" that stabilizes the price. But if people stop using it as a currency it becomes a very poor store of value because unlike gold it doesn't have industrial or jewelry use cases. That's my 2 cents anyway.
Either way, while the price is in the doldrums I hope that enough of the newcomers to Bitcoin see it's great potential and keep their heads down to do the hard work needed to scale it, get fees back down, and again drive adoption as a currency. Because that's what'll make it more usable as a store of value long term.
TL;DR: Bitcoin needs to be used as a currency in order to become a good store of value, you can't have a good store of value with **only** speculative use, Gold is a good store of value because it's not just a store of value-it has industrial and jewelry demand that keeps the price stable enough that it's a good store of value.

90 hedge funds splitting 2.3 billion means they're averaging 25 million each. That is pretty small for a hedge fund since many regular hedge funds hold hundreds of millions to billions in one fund. But a lot of these are probably investing in weird altcoins so there's no liquidity for them to invest much more than a few million. 
The futures markets will let more funds invest, but the problem is that it won't help the price of bitcoin much since it's a future!
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:01:34
That's not the real reason though.  The reason is pretty simple.  Miners will soon depend on transaction fees for all their revenue, as the reward continues to drop. So miners very heavily favor on chain scaling as it maintains the status quo economic incentives for mining at all.
With smaller blocks more people will use second layer solutions, which means that the folks running second layer solutions will be getting much of the revenues via fees instead of the miners. So of course miners are not in favor of this, and want there to be on chain scaling.
The real question isn't even which is technically better, I'm more concerned about how the incentives to secure the network will work if second layer solutions take up the bulk of network fees.

And you know, the main reason I've hung onto my Bitcoin all these years is because Bitcoin is a self fulfilling prophecy if I've ever seen one.

If you're overwhelmed please don't rush into things, read up and learn how to safely manage your private keys.  Using your own wallet requires that you know what you're doing, and make a ton of backups so you don't lose all your money.
For most people using an SPV wallet is probably fine, and preferably one that'll let you split your coins and whatnot.

Well that's not true, there are other second layer solutions but they're not as decentralized as lightning network. While Bakkt is initially launching futures their plan is also to operate as a second layer payment processor as well, which is why companies like Starbucks are on-board as well. Cash app will likely have their own internal payments layer, Coinbase already has their own internal payments layer, etc. 
There are also on chain improvements that will help LN but also provide some scaling of their own, like Schnorr signatures and whatnot.

I don't think you understand how the nodes work...after the split they are separate networks entirely so the number of 1x nodes being higher won't affect the 2x network at all. Whether there's 10,000 or 1 million 1x nodes it won't help or harm the 2x network.
The replay risk doesn't change the fact that they will be separate networks, it just means that transactions on one network are valid on the other network.  But they are separate networks entirely.

Yes but you can work to design a new better ASIC and go build your own miners that outperform existing ones. As many companies have done and continue to do. Even though Bitmain is on top right now that's not a guarantee that they'll stay on top, they have to keep trying to build next generation chips or the other players like Avalon or Halong or SBI can catch up. There have been plenty of different ASICs over the years as well. Everyone from Buttery Labs, KnC, Cointerra, 21.co, Spondoolies, Dragon (LKETC), AsicMiner (Friedcat), and Bitfury have created ASICs, many were the best ASICs around when they first came out.
All these companies put work into trying to design a better ASIC and many were very well rewarded by having the best ASICs available at the time. It's just that right now Bitmain is on top, partly because they've been the most aggressive about producing in vast quantities and selling large amounts to customers.

The more I've thought about this the more I've decided that regardless of who was posting as "Satoshi" that Hal was clearly very critical to the creation of Bitcoin. Perhaps there was a singular Satoshi or perhaps Satoshi was multiple people collaborating, but either way we should be thankful that Hal was able to contribute so much before he was taken entirely too early from us.
I do personally think that the fact that he was the recipient of the very first transaction makes it rather more likely that he was at least part of Satoshi.

Because many people have large amounts of money in retirement accounts that can only purchase stocks and ETFs and bonds listed on an actual market? There is a vast amount of wealth locked up in 401K's and IRAs and Roth IRA's that can't be moved out and can't buy Bitcoins easily. That's why you see GBTC trade at such a gigantic premium to Bitcoin itself, a lot of people have hundreds of thousands or millions in these retirement accounts but they can't use it to directly buy Bitcoins.
Either way the ETFs will almost certainly have insurance policies on their underlying Bitcoin to be approved.
Bitcoin as a money is mostly about self sufficiency but for Bitcoin as a store of value that doesn't necessarily have to be the case. And let's be honest, most people I know can't even secure their own computers, asking everyone to be in charge of their own private keys is idiocy.

After seeing the absurd ICOs that raised 8 or 9 figures last year I actually understand why the government started this whole accredited investor thing. Maybe they should allow an alternative way of being accredited by taking a test requiring people to understand concepts of economics, finance, and technology or something, but the main reason why the government doesn't want everyone throwing all their cash into the next Bitconnect or whatever is that it's the government that has to hand out food stamps when all these idiots go bankrupt and can't feed their family.

There's centralization of hashpower to large pools but it's not clear that the actual miners are centralized. Especially with the [Chinese government having cracked down on mining operations]( the hashrate is likely more distributed than before.
**Hashrate tends to centralize in larger pools because this gives miners a more predictable and stable income.** A pool that has 0.1% of hashrate will have very unstable block generation rates compared to one that has 20% of hashrate. Most miners need to pay the electricity bills, so mining at a pool that only occasionally finds a block and then doesn't find one for a long time is not sustainable. But this doesn't mean that the actual hashpower is centralized to any particular data center or any particular mining operation.
I don't think Bitcoin is less secure than it was, if anything the sheer amount of hash power has made it much more difficult for anybody except the most powerful state actors to attack Bitcoin because of the sheer amount of electricity required. Mining pool centralization is due to the need of miners for a steady income more than anything else-nobody wants to mine on a small mining pool and have unpredictable income.
I honestly think we need more work put into distributed pools like p2pool to make them more competitive with the big centralized pools just so the hashpower doesn't excessively concentrate in centralized pools. And certainly new ASIC manufacturers would significantly improve the ability for new mining operations to come online, but Bitcoin is certainly not less secure than it used to be.

I was originally thinking the supply shock would take a similarly long amount of time like it did in 2017, but I've rethought this in recent weeks and realized that because the current rewards is lower this cycle and mining costs are running up to be a larger proportion of the rewards that the miners will likely not be hoarding as many older Bitcoins as last time around. The delay in the lack of new supply significantly affecting the price is simply because miners still had a lot of their old supply of coins on hand that they were still dumping. Once they finished selling off the older supplies the fact that only half as many new coins were coming onto the market really made the price jump. But this time around since the reward is smaller to begin with and because mining costs have risen so much, they really shouldn't have as many hoarded coins.
So I expect that the price should really start moving within a month or two of the next halving, which should mean a huge price jump around July 2020. That would give McAfee 5 months for the price to then run up to $1 million.
Now personally I don't think it's going to get all the way to $1 million, I'm thinking more like $100-400K on the next big bubble but I'd love to be proven wrong on this since it'd make me rich lol.

There's a bunch of reasons that even if you're using a more advanced node that you might not actually gain much in terms of efficiency or clock speed. For one thing most of these newer "10nm" nodes aren't truly 10nm for everything, only **portions** of the chip are 10nm whereas other parts of the chip may measure up to 20nm. That's how both Samsung and TSMC label their chips, it's based on the smallest portion of the chip. Only Intel tends to try and shrink everything throughout before naming it 10nm and that's part of why Intel isn't actually producing any 10nm chips.  And new process nodes are less mature than old ones, so even though it's the cutting edge process you may actually find that more mature ones get better chip quality/yields.
Basically you shouldn't assume that a chip that's been made on "10nm" is really more efficient than a chip made on any other recent process size. The differences aren't as big as the numbers make it seem because not all the chip is shrunk down that much and on top of that the new processes are less mature.

Realistically the goal is to have LN condense down all those transactions so that even though each individual on chain transaction may be $5 or $10 or whatever, you're actually processing hundreds or thousands of transactions for that one on chain fee. The criticisms right now are about LN in its current state and it's certainly true that it's not particularly efficient in terms of how many on-chain transactions you really need to be able to spend and receive easily (since it takes at least one on chain transaction to get you incoming receive ability and realistically you'll need multiple incoming channels to receive any meaningful amounts). You also need to open up big enough channels right now since I believe payments can't yet split over multiple channels. So if you want to send 500000 satoshi but you have a 300000 outgoing channel and a 200000 sat outgoing channel it won't let you combine those right now-resulting you needing to go open yet another channel on chain (which is rather inefficient)-but that's coming soon.
I think most of the criticisms see Lightning Network as what it functionally is right now but seem to ignore that it's constantly improving. The question is more whether it will improve in a timely fashion before some big bubble hits and high fees cause a lot of frustration. That part isn't as clear, but I think in the long run they'll probably be able to get LN working well enough to genuinely help Bitcoin scale. The base layer will likely still need a small bump in the blocksize eventually, but I think it'd be plausible to have mass adoption with just a relatively small bump from where we are already.

If you sell it you can write down the losses and deduct them from your income tax, but it's capped at $3000 per year. You can hold the losses over many years though and use $3000 against your regular income per year. I would talk to your accountant since it doesn't sound like you're familiar with taking investment losses and you do have to properly keep track of how much loss carryover you have remaining, etc.
You also have to use it against capital gains taxes first, but there is no limit to that-the $3000 limit just applies against normal income.
You do have to sell it though to write down the losses, even if you buy it back 2 minutes later. That's what I did a couple of days ago, I sold it and bought it back about 5 minutes later (actually saved about $2 per BTC lol)

Already done...wrote down ~$7500 per BTC I bought earlier this year...not particularly fun.
Might also be a good time if you have some BTC with gains to reprice your entry price so you're more free to actively trade, since you only have to pay the cap gains on the gains to $4000k and not $15k or whatever. The problem of course is that for early adopters that's still a massive tax bill.

Watchtowers are good, but I'm really looking forward to when lightning channel factories become real. That's what we really need to allow LN to work really well to boost scaling, otherwise we still need way too many onchain transactions for it to be practical.
@_date: 2018-12-22 04:28:36
With LN unless you are very technically savvy it is going to be difficult to not use an intermediary. I really can't see end users using LN without going through an intermediary anytime soon. Even with watchtowers you still need to be able to close your channels and a normal person who doesn't know anything about computers isn't going to want to run a 24/7 server so they'll just use a service that'll do it for them. Most people will definitely not be doing [stuff like this]( lol.
So most likely the vast majority of LN payments will be run via intermediaries that'll much like Paypal does with fiat. Whether that's good or bad is up for debate I guess.

So if you insist on running a full now on your phone it's perfectly possible to sync. You could also obviously do the initial sync on wifi instead of eating up all your mobile data.

I don't think this will pass, they're running huge deficits as it is and not that many people want to give crypto extra tax savings.

Unless they find an exchanger for them to exchange into whatever currency they pay employees with, it's still going to be possible to shut down their payments. They could pay employees all in crypto I suppose.

Why does it look suspiciously like you did not HODL but actually sold a bunch near the peak and paid off your mortgage?

To be fair, Jack Dorsey does back [Lightning Labs financially and also has his company Square back it](  so even though he doesn't personally code anything for LN he's still significant in promoting LN development since he's providing the funding to keep the devs paid.
He's not the only person funding them at all, other people are providing significant funding too, but he is more involved with the development LN than you're making it sound. That's why you often [see him talking about LN w/Elizabeth Stark]( etc.
That all said, I don't think it's some crazy conspiracy theory by Jack Dorsey, I think he legitimately believes in Bitcoin. I do think eventually he will offer a custodial LN platform on Square I don't think it's his dastardly plan to centralize Bitcoin-just to make it more approachable for normal people since realistically it's not going to be a common currency if everyone really has to run their own Bitcoin Node and LND on top of that. So I welcome Dorsey backing Lightning Labs and having Square back Bitcoin so strongly.

And a large transaction does not necessarily cause your account to be locked, as long as your funds appear to be legitimate. That's why Coinbase asks you where you get your money from, what your income is, etc.
If you guys think Coinbase is bad try doing KYC with some of the big Swiss crypto firms. Basically they bend you over and stick their arm up your ass before allowing anything.

Was in it then...sold most of mine on gox for a couple hundred bucks then gambled the rest on sealswithclubs and satoshi dice. Think I lost about 20btc gambling but it was "just $200" back then and no I didn't rebuy to replace them right away.
Very few folks legit hodl'd until now from 2011. Of my current BTC probably less than 10% are from those 2011 days because of my stupidity in basically spending and selling virtually all of it
