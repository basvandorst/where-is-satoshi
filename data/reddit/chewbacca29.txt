This is something I am unsure of aswell. The bank said that the customer was claiming it was a job scam (but then they later said his account got hacked. I dont think they were telling me the truth.. as you have to be pretty stupid to fall for things like that). However I don't know why the localbitcoins buyer of bitcoin would go to all that hassle for one customer out of 30+. They had traded over 150btc before they came to me, and I was the only one out of all of that to get complain about the buyer.

You will always need a bank involved somewhere as fiat needs to go from your account to the exchange.
On BTC-E you can put cash through OkPay and a few other places, but OkPay charges you about 1.5% to deposit on BTC-E

No, as I pointed out the buyer appeared trustworthy. I'm selling them bitcoins and accepting fiat as payment. No different if I was operating an FX stall and selling them USD.

I get your point, problem is I am not going to wire over small amounts of fiat to exchanges everytime I get some cash. NAB charges through the roof to wire cash to an overseas exchange, so better to do it in larger amounts.

Something I learnt is that in Aus, when you cash deposit you have to give your name and number to the bank when depositing. So you can still claim back your funds as the bank still has your deets.

It was a cash deposit, I would never accept CC. Essentially the guy who deposited cash was trying to scam me.
I was unaware that they didn't allow bitcoin trading as I was new to this. 
The point of my post was to help those who are new as well and who could be in a similar situation.

The fee is 0.075% for a taker, ur 100x off there buddy. Your leverage doesnt change the fee you pay

Why not use something like cryptowat.ch or TradingView for the coin (if listed) you're looking at and use that.

This is called wash trading, it's illegal in traditional financial markets as it can be used to manipulate price moves and generate phony interest in the stock.
