Regardless of the path he took, as shit as it may be, he ended up with more BTC than he initially paid for. Stop being salty.

I've never used localbitcoin, but I understand how it is used. If you do go along with localbitcoins, use the cash deposit option. When playing with bitcoin, know this, your bitcoin transaction is and always will be one way. Fiat currency can be pulled back, which puts the sender of bitcoin (you) at risk. You have to make your own decision, weigh up the risks.
@_date: 2018-01-04 00:34:42
Risk with taking payment in fiat through the banking system is the change of reversal (by the person you are transacting with claiming fraudulent use of their account). Coinbase is an exchange, the risk with coinbase is they lose your coins, however that is extremely minimal.

Not a programmer. Just a person.
With one transaction to a LN node, the lightning network confirms you have said BTC to spend and "locks it" within itself, and the same for whom ever is connected in this network. From this point on none of these bitcoins move in the BTC blockchain while simultaneously moving around the lightning network as many times as need be. The only time they move on the blockchain is when the user decides "i wish to withdraw BTC locked in by the lightning network" and so the final balance (after maybe several hundred) on the lighting node is transacted to the user and is seen as one transaction. Thus it would never matter about the blockchain falling behind as all the BTC involved in the LN are locked in, and those locked in BTC make up the total circulating supply of the LN.
Correct me if I'm wrong anyone but that's how I've understood the whole thing to work.

Congested network. Use segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:00:15
Basically what happens is this. You put money in coinbase and buy bitcoins. You own the bitcoins but coinbase hold it for you. When the person you want to send bitcoin to also has a coinbase account it's easy for coinbase to just say "ok your $4 bitcoins are now X's $4 bitcoins" and this change in ownership happens off the bitcoin blockchain. 
Edit: the new owner of the bitcoin can "claim ownership/redeem" the bitcoin by conducting a withdrawal from coinbase/gdax into their own private wallet and this transaction will be recorded on the blockchain. This is a similar situation to what lightning would be, however without the factor of "coinbase" being the middle man, rather it would be a written piece of software which will run this not controlled by any corportation. Correct me if I'm wrong but thats my interperation of things.
Edit 2: And the reason why lightning is taking long is that it has to run flawless to eliminate security risks. And for bitcoin security is of upmost priority as without it, you lose trust in the whole system and it falls apart.

Also, your fees were almost twice the value of your transaction. You could have cut them by 1/4
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:21:44
Coinbase uses a stupid amount of transaction fee to prioritize the user transaction on the blockchain above all. I'm pretty sure they take a cut as well on top but since I've always transfered to GDAX then withdrew I don't know what coinbase's cut is.

But not secure
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:29:25
They shouldn't be. The next step from lightning is eventually increasing blocksize, there is no way around it. More blocks mean more transaction fees, more adaption and trust in BTC means increased value. If anything they'll get more in the long run out of BTC mining. However the issue they have is utilizing maximum profits using the machines capabilities they have now before they become obsolete by more efficient machines that are released in the future.
Edit: blocksize increase currently does not need to happen, first is widespread segwit adoption for second layer.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:37:45
Wait, stop dont do it. It'll charge you the really high BTC fees right now. DO NOT do it
Edit: If you want to withdraw do this. Transfer your BTC to GDAX. If you just want to sell asap. Then sell your BTC in the market tab then press "sell order", it'll take 0.25% of the transaction as a fee from you. Then you have Euro left. Transfer either transfer the euro back into coinbase and then withdraw as normal.
Edit2: I suspect if you send your btc through coinbase to your euro wallet address it will first take the bitcoin transaction fees which are astronomical atm. 
Edit3: I assumed you already have your BTC in coinbase, if you don't then you're going to have to transfer it to coinbase/gdax anyways in which case there really is no escaping the btc transaction fees.

Eventually there will have to be a blocksize increase with increased adoption. But today is not the day. Current priority is to get LN.
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:59:31
Everything going through the blockchain is not compatible with daily transactions when adopted on a wide scale. At a rate of $100k or $1m per BTC the transaction fees will be $0.23 or $2.27 respectively, and this is the absolute minimum at a rate of 1 satoshi per byte. No amount of blocksize change including an infinity sized block will ever solve this.
Edit: At a rate of $13600 which is what it is now, Buying a pint of milk at 50c would cost ~0.53c, as the lowest possible transaction fee is ~$0.03.
Edit2: Miners may like it, but without adoption they would be mining a dead coin. LN is absolutely required and it's required in it's fullest as secure as possible.
Edit3: Forgot a 0, recalculated figures.

Security and trust measured by the test of time. With a market cap in the hundreds of billions, it hasn't been possible to hack break the code. Steal someones private key sure, but to crack the public wallet without key, nope. There has been real monetary incentive to try, yet it isn't possible with current technology. 
Theres a wallet just sitting there with billions in worth of bitcoin. The day bitcoin is insecure you'll see targeting of exchange wallets and the genesis block funds (assuming he's never going to touch them).

@_date: 2017-12-24 19:29:16
Same, I really don't care for the 1mb v 8mb right now even though BCH is clearing transactions quick as BTC has no choice but to increase blocksize eventually. Right now something like the LN has to be developed or else we may as well jump on an altcoin for crypto use in the future.

Never used that before, but did you make sure the BTC address is the same as that listed by QuadrigaCX? As long as the address is the same that you've put in then it'll go through. It is a lil strange though, GDAX uses the highest fees for high priority transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:48:32
There may be some truth to this somewhere. Only reason I say this is last time something major happened Roger made a video about how MtGox is fine. This time round, though the narrative may have changed, he says keep your coins on the exchange. With coinbase being one of the largest exchanges, no doubt it would play into this.
The above is ofcorse pure speculation
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:36:07
Second to what projas has said, it wouldn't be given there is mass adoption of the technology. Let's assume there's 1 billion people who use the blockchain. And each of those people make 3 transactions per year only; 1 to the LN, 1 to withdraw from the LN, and 1 to Deposit into the LN.
3*1b=3b / 365days/24h/60mins/60seconds = 95 transactions on the main btc blockchain per second. 
This is far from death of the BTC blockchain, as this accounts for only 3 transactions form 1/7th of the world population a year and would yield 95 transactions per/s, and google says atm BTC can handle a maximum of 7. In this situation miners would have greater than 10x the transaction fees made avaliable to them. Secondly there is no doubt, bitcoin would have to increase the blocksize at some point to meet these demands, the Bitcoin team/community for whatever reason (I have not looked into what these are) has decided this is to be delayed and focus on the second layer, lightning network which would accommodate the transaction requirements for the world population to use easily. Without this, BTC is useless from a movement of value point of view (see above equation) [also waiting 6x10mins for confirmations is not acceptable in day to day transactions]. However such a solution is absolutely dependent on firstly being secure from a software prospective and dependent on the bitcoin blockchain backbone, for its precieved trust and value given by people and its resistance to interference by a single person.
It would be much like the banks holding gold and issuing paper IOU's to people. The gold need not leave the bank yet the IOU paper can change hands millions of times over, and when you want, you can claim the gold with your IOU. However Bitcoin removes the bank from the equation and makes the code law.
Correct me if im wrong in any of this, this is just how ive interpreted things.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:25:45
Yup, alternatively if you have more than 0.01btc, you can move it to gdax, sell it there (please do read up if youre not familiar with trading) for minimal/no fees, transfer the euro back to coinbase and do a withdrawal.
Edit: if you let coinbase do things, they put charges on it which you can avoid by doing things through their gdax platform.

Posted this in another thread.
Everything going through the blockchain is not compatible with daily transactions when adopted on a wide scale. At a rate of $100k or $1m per BTC/BCH the transaction fees will be $0.23 or $2.27 respectively, and this is the absolute minimum at a rate of 1 satoshi per byte (at 226bytes per transaction). No amount of blocksize change including an infinity sized block will ever solve this.
Edit: At a rate of $13600 which is what BTC is now, Buying a pint of milk at 50c would cost ~0.53c, as the lowest possible transaction fee is ~$0.03.
The way i see things is. Yes BCH may be able to clear transactions quicker now, but it's not set for mass adoption. The cost to the user is far to great using BCH. With BTC aiming for LN development the cost to the user will be far far less and transactions being instantaneous rather than waiting for ~10 minutes for inclusion to a block and 1hour for 6 conformations..
Imagine having to pay an extra 3c per transaction. in the 1pint milk for 50c scenario you're paying 6% in transaction fees.
