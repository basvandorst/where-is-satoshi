Your correct, we don't know how many Bitcoin are accessible and circulating. We do know the block reward is approximately 25 BTC every 10 minutes, which translates to ~ 3,600 new coins put in to circulation daily.

I just want to say Good Luck! and have some fun too. Crypto markets can be fun if you do a deep dive and are not afraid to explore new tech. It's probably for the best that you don't have much € starting out (your mistakes are less painful, lol), but keep at it and you'll have plenty of funds when you're seasoned.

Agreed. That's a starting point. What do you think signifies a crash? 
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:26:46
Generally, greater than 20% fall from recent highs is a correction. You wouldn't consider a 50% decrease in value in less than 30 days a crash? I'd be interested in how you would definite a crash (quantitatively). 
What about a "bubble burst"? Traditional markets generally regard this as a 90% fall from ATH. 
^Not meant to be negative, that's how I write. I'm just generally curious. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:16:12
Just to be clear, supply &amp; demand isn't tightly correlated in crypto. 
Also, the supply isn't fixed. You might be thinking of the Total Supply limit of 21MM, but every day that passes there are thousands more Bitcoin released in to circulation via mining. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:28:35
Not looking to 'trick' anyone, my man. I simply want people to be informed. Counting all bitcoins in circulation today (in wallets, on exchanges, lost, whatever) its about 16.7M. That means 4+ million Bitcoins are yet to hit the market. So available Bitcoin is not exactly "fixed" is my only point.

Let’s take a minute to talk about your assumption that ‘selfishness and greed’ are these wonderful components of game theory that are protecting our ecosystem. Those of us that remember the cluster fuck that was The New York Agreement are all too familiar with the greed of a very small group of men that played at being Bitcoin Gods. You might say, “but things worked out! Something, something free market game theory!” To which my reply is, why and how the fuck did it even get to the point where &lt; 50 people in a hotel in NYC were deciding the future of this project?? Selfishness and greed almost brought us to an irrevocable point of centralization, which should and must be rejected in all of its ugly forms.

I love how you call 6K "legitimate support". When BTC hit 6K last year it had gone almost 3X in 4-5 months, which is obviously part of the pump/bull run, not before it. 
Just calm down and think about year-over-year. More interest, more buyers, more utilization, more portals to get in (exchanges, wallets, brick and mortar brokers offering custody, etc). The price has been going up massively year-over-year in relation to this. 
You need to widen your time horizon. We are up 127% from this point last year. Stop worrying about BTC being 5K 30 days from now. Look to June 2019 and tell me what you see.

My criticism is thus: The team produced a rough sketch of a subway system on a cocktail napkin and then presented it to the world and asked them to buy subway tokens to ride. Maybe they'll build the system and maybe they won't. All we have is promises and marketing and "in 6 months they'll be better than Ethereum". This is the part that people call a 'scam', which I will just label unethical. The company says we have everything figured out and just need the funds to start development, when in reality they raised a boatload of money and are no trying to figure out what to do with it. 
Yes - the crypto space is buyer-beware, but it still leaves a bad taste in some people's mouths to see a company blow smoke and take money for a TBD product (with zero legal ramifications if said product isn't built). 
Even if you don't care about investor protections and assume EOS is definitely going to bring a revolutionary product to market, you have to admit it is just pure economic inefficiency to raise that much money day-one when all you have is a blueprint (maybe?). This is why traditional start-ups get funded in multiple rounds. 
TL;DR: EOS isn't a scam but is definitely taking advantage of market ignorance. It is much more likely to go bust then "revolutionize the crypto space"...whatever than means.

2/3 of all people are contributing towards equity investments when you consider pensions, endowments, 401k, etc. that's why institutional money is what will actually lift this market to new heights. Think about the gains you've seen at the retail investor level (one human being signing up for account and wallet and trading). Now think about the California pension system putting 10% of their assets under management in to crypto (effortless and recurring contributions from millions of people). 
That's why you want to hold the coins and tokens not with the greatest chance of successfully implementing their goals, but with the greatest prospect of being held in a custodial fund for these gigantic players when they enter.

The pain the American consumer feels is related to the lack of wage growth (the rock) and the onslaught of inflation (the wave), relentlessly beating the quality of life out of middle class workers. Less bank fees and less inflation would ease some of this pain, yes, but if you look at the last 10 yer period; Banks were highly regulated and inflation was nearly zero and the middle class consumer still suffered greatly. 
TL;DR: A deflationary currency will take the sting out, but the long term solution is a government that cares about quality of life/purchasing power, effectuating policies that bring wage growth and tight financial oversight.

Since your THREE paragraph reply is devoid of facts, let me drop some on you. 
1) Asset prices like stocks and real estate increase in value for reasons other than money supply/inflation. 
2) I didn’t say zero inflation, I said less than 2% annually. This is also less than the Fed’s Target. 
3) QE expansion ended in 2014; and after 5 years of unabated liquidity increases, to the tune of over 4 trillion dollars, the inflation rate that year was 1.62%. Inflation was 3.54% through 2017 ($100 in 2014 is the equivalent of $103.54 in 2017 dollars).
And yes, this uses the CPI. Do you have a better index/metric? If you’re going to argue someone’s point, please try to bring facts or at least reasoning to the table. You offered only ‘CPI is phony and QE is good psychologically’, which is weak.

Clearly he’s the night-terror of every conservative politician and judge and if they could have hung him by his toes in the public square to make an example they would have. This is a clear case of the punishment not fitting the crime. 
That being said, I just want to inform people that he isn’t non-violent. This isn’t like they identified, caught and imprisoned Satoshi because he drop some protocol software on the world and walked away. He was actively involved in Silk Road, the ugliest day-to-day activities of running a drug distribution empire. He absolutely authorized the use of deadly force. Not proving it and not convicting it are two different things.

The reasons mentioned above - ‘Rarity’, ‘Utility’, and ‘it’s the future’ don’t matter one iota (pun intended). Bitcoin is worth what someone will pay for it. We are seeing classic Price Discovery. Bitcoin is global and decentralized and anyone in the world can weigh in with bid/ask information to determine an accurate value for this snapshot in time. There are plenty of buyers out there, but we need to see more buyers than sellers (including the 3,000+ daily bitcoins created via mining), then and only then will the price be bid up. 
When the expectation was price increase, many owners were holding their bitcoin, making supply even more scarce, but now people are parting ways with their BTC more easily, there’s still mining pools selling daily to recoup costs, and the B-cash war is causing a flood of BTC to hit the market. More sellers than buyers = downward pressure on the bidding of a coin and thus the price you can achieve for the sale. 
Case in point: this thread is filled with people saying they will ‘buy all the bitcoins before it reaches zero’, but they’re not saying ‘I will buy now ($3,600 at time of post). This indicates the price will continue to drop.

Assuming the mining reward rate and price are flat, how does a difficulty adjustment incentivize more mining/profitability? Do the miners need to use less electricity per block mined?

Basic economic principals cannot explain the crypto markets my dude. Irrational AF up in here. 
And you ridicule young people investing small amounts looking to become rich, but that is exactly what happened to an entire segment of this market. So what are you driving at?

To clarify, the total maximum (eventual) supply of Bitcoin is fixed at 21MM, but the circulating supply of Bitcoin is always increasing (by thousands of coins per day). So it’s not factually correct that Bitcoin is a deflationary currency.

That sounds great until you realize you bought €500 worth of bitcoin last month to spend on Christmas gifts and now you only have enough to buy €275 worth of gifts (assuming you can use crypto to buy things, which is often not the case). 
And if you’re buying BTC to spend immediately (limiting carrying costs/risk) then why not just spend the Euro? All that transferring into BTC and spending is just adding fees to your purchases.

I don’t buy the ‘investigation’ response. What central authority is binance cooperating with to investigate a single account? If it is an internal Binance investigation why don’t they just say that? And that is even MORE problematic, that the exchange can just freeze assets at will to conduct their own investigation with no details. The founder has taken big risks in the past to ensure transparency and promote trust. Something just doesn’t seem right here....if I was Binance leadership I would get in front of this asap. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 14:44:13
I agree with you whole heartedly. This is a public ledger of trust and good will that Binance cannot ignore. You ‘fly to their offices with a lawyer’ and maybe they don’t see you or put you on ice....you get a few thousand crypto enthusiasts to question what is going on or call out unfair treatment and it cannot be ignored.

Your ‘source’ is an info-graphic from a website that is a series of advertisements for brand name financial platforms/products. Zero explanation as to how the number is derived.

I agree 100%. Bitcoin and USDC shouldn’t be competing for the same users. One is a tool for stability wrought with flaws and risks, and the other is a globally secured network of value exchange. So why is everyone up in arms? 
@_date: 2019-05-07 10:40:26
Year-to-date (YTD) is a period, starting from the beginning of the current year (either the calendar year or fiscal year) and continuing to the present day. 
January 1st, 2019 BTC was $3,823. So you’re wrong. And a dickhead.
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:44:34
You should not fear competition, you should welcome it and vote with your $/BTC/USDC. 
Anyone can create products and technology. Andreessen Horowitz or any other billion dollar fund is able to invest if it sees value. There should be no moats or government protections in this space. BTC can’t rest on its first mover and brand advantage forever. Free market baby. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 02:26:42
That 100% profit is based on your buy orders executing and BTC reaching 6K again? Otherwise I don’t follow the logic of buying all the way down from 3.4K to 2.5K

CoinMarketCap reports $3,750 (average across exchanges) and Coinbase, the most popular exchange in the U.S., reports $3,823. This is just sloppy reporting by the WSJ or maybe they wanted the returns to appear higher than they actually are for dramatic effect?
@_date: 2018-12-05 14:47:15
Inspected by whom? Don’t you think that is a relevant question? Either Binance is cooperating with local law enforcement or they are conducting internal investigations (and freezing assets). Both of these ideas are concerning. But hey, it’s not you so stop caring and start finger pointing (until it is).
