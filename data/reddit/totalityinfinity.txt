It's a downright shame considering how much greater Circle used to be.

I've been using BTC for years, just never thought about investment opportunities. 
Think before you assume.

Asked to others here, but what's your vote on Electrum as an interest opportunity?
@_date: 2017-04-30 07:03:41
(Assuming I don't send it back to PayPal or my bank for instance) but so ultimately, I gather that if you want to actually own your own coins, then you just need to have a separate wallet for this or use specific services/websites. My reasoning for using Electrum was for more security in the BTC transaction process, but as stated in this thread, I never really thought about the idea of investing/accumulating interest.

I understand $5 won't do much, it was just what I have in there at the time.
What about Electrum, or is another wallet preferred?
@_date: 2017-04-28 14:51:43
Will consider, but suggestions where to keep the coins aside from Coinbase if at all?

Everyone has different motives, dude. I didn't say I was looking to get rich, I asked about the nature of investment. What do you think, I expect millions of dollars to come pouring into my account? No, I am just curious about what the fuss is about.

Not entirely, posted before and lurked, bust just only now posting a question with only a small amount of value in mind. I understand far more is needed to earn interest.

I don't understand why it isn't easier to just cancel a transaction instead of having it wait in limbo, it's frustrating and I'm not sure what exactly is going on.

Which ones will?
Excuse the ignorance, user of BTC but I'm only self-involved in my own bubble, I didn't read much into anything else.
@_date: 2017-04-28 14:54:21
Nothing, I've held far more in BTC but this is now the time when interest has peaked my curiosity. 
@_date: 2017-04-28 15:35:15
Very helpful, thank you!
@_date: 2017-04-28 14:50:45
Any word on Electrum in terms of interest rates or anything? Or is it merely a wallet of its own.
@_date: 2017-04-28 14:55:17
Any links? What of a 1BTC values major increase in the last few months?
@_date: 2017-04-29 10:58:24
Any idea of a good starting investment?
Also, to all those in this thread, has anyone seen their wealth grow a bit through BTC?

I'll sleep on it for now and see if there's any changes in the morning; I have my own fear and uncertainty and doubts with posting IDs and information because I'm not all that familiar with the process of BTCS (my go to vendors have been no hassle, so I never had a problem before and am maybe overreacting).
