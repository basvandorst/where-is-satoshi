sounds like a cool story... bro.

Sounds like you bought some Storjcoin.

Propaganda war.

They started their IPVO in September 2013, the price of one Bitcoin was around 125$ that time. Try again.

If that's true, i'm confident Karma will get him sooner than later :)
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:47:28
True but people like slogans connected to words that ring in their ears.

Email josh to see if he can do something.. oh wait.

That is what the guy who posted the pictures said.
@_date: 2014-07-24 09:56:14
He stood up for what he thinks is right and he has every right to do so. Mt.Gox has ruined alot of peoples lifes and every single person who stands up to protest deserves my respect. 
The only pathetic thing I could find here, is you trying to ridicule a person who protests against injustice.

OP is full of shit. Probably lost his .2 BTC life savings and is now raging at an honest member of the BTC community. Try this: Step 1: Think - Step 2: Post.

Bitcoin - One World One Currency.
Bitcoin - Global tender for a globalized world.

A Bank holding your money hostage? That comes almost as unexpected as a chinese regime suppressing a free currency.
Time for Plan B!
Hope they release your property soon.

How do we get more trading volume to our small exchange with 500 BTC 24h volume... ?
Let's double the fees! 
I really liked you kraken, but that is just dumb and greedy.
@_date: 2014-08-07 10:35:22
I just don't think it is the right move right now. They are getting closer and closer to the bitstamp fees. 
Sure, they still beat a lot of their competitors fee wise, but they will harm their growth if they try to take the same fees as the big exchanges. If they want to catch up, they should stick to those 0.2% fees as an outstanding advantage compared to others.
IF they reach a 7k-8k 24h Volume like bitstamp and consensus is still 0.35- 0.5% fees, i would completly understand a fee adjustment.

N24 is NOT a highly regarded news channel BECAUSE it is part of the Springer Group. And it is weeks old news.
@_date: 2014-08-11 02:16:19
Yea i would like to know that too, are these over or under the original 2.1 - 2.2 BTC these Days?
@_date: 2014-04-01 15:31:07
So you might be reposting FUD. Hey who cares, you might get some attention and karma out of it. Fool.
@_date: 2014-08-15 04:59:09
Well played.

Good Job! Do you get any responses? Have you tried handing out flyers to people who are unbanked and maybe in more need of bitcoin than the people operating financial hubs?
@_date: 2014-04-11 08:50:21
Connecting two of the most addicting things around. Bitcoin and Hearthstone. Well played sir!

Anyone sent a SEPA to gox recently? How long did it take to get credited?

The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation initiated a project for gen-manipulated soyseeds together with the big CARGILL cooperation. Against heavy protests from natives in Mosambique. 
They profit big time on their "help".
Edit: Oh and guess who is heavily invested in Monsanto.
@_date: 2013-10-30 07:14:00
It might be the confidence in bitcoin reaching new highs. So there are simply more people holding, less people selling, leading to a higher price of bitcoin.
Though it could just be coincidence or a technical slip up in the chart.
@_date: 2013-11-14 12:02:14
Whoever it is is, we should crown him the bitcoin king and take his future predictions as a guidebook for the time ahead.
Oh.. wait.
@_date: 2013-11-16 10:49:39
No one knows. Don't trust anyone saying a different thing because the one is most likely driven by own interests.
Trust your guts, make your decision and never look back/regret.
Try trusting the idea and the potential of bitcoin. Step away from letting the price dictate your actions.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:14:59
You will NOT make your investment back with these machines! And no Butterfly Labs is NOT trustworthy. In general, mining is nowhere near as profitable as it was a couple of months ago with those low budget machines. Buy Bitcoins with your money and most definately don't throw your hard earnd money at Butterfly Labs.

Well, the thread was just the basis for the now existing asset.
Check the Bitfunder link and you should find the information you are looking for.

I read somewhere the RDP-lawfirm was planning an update in early october. Let's hope for good news this time...
@_date: 2013-11-30 21:51:25
Why downvote this guy? Don't be blinded by those donations.
People inform yourselfs about what Bill Gates does in Africa and in what kind of businesses he is heavily invested in.
Hint: He's donating money that is earned by destroying the african agriculture, leaving african people in an unchanged and desperate situation.

The latest posts of Knc officials indicated, that power consumption will be below 1.4w/gh. By how much, they have not stated yet.

If your story is legit, I really feel bad for you and appreciate you sharing your bad experience to prevent others from doing the same. Just wanted to let you know how your story could be precieved by others.

Oh people in the trollbox are saying it? That just has to be true.

Aaaand what exactly proves the wallet file is actually lost in the first place?
@_date: 2013-10-25 13:06:43
Mastercard and Visa might disagree with you ;)
@_date: 2013-12-10 09:14:02
Yeah no. Sorry to break it to you, but the bitcoin world economy is not revolving around the USA and especially not around  fox business on cnn.
@_date: 2013-11-11 10:48:54
I would recommend Bitstamp if you live in Europe, it is very quick (money in, money out + the initial verification), you have alot of trading volume (if you want to trade) and the interface is much more userfriendly than the one at mt.gox. Despite all this, Gox has had a lot of problems in the past and have yet to prove, that these problems have been taken care of.
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:51:48
Oh great advice! I thought they were sold out.
From what I have seen, this company seems to have great potential.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:20:38
Hm don't get me wrong.. but that sounds like a cool story with a lot of drama pointed towards an euphoric crowd who likes to tip poor souls big amounts of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-10 09:11:09
Non US person here. He is a republican politician who allways critiziced leaving the Goldstandard of the dollar. Quite alot libertarian souls follow him. However, when it comes to bitcoin.. he seems pretty effin clueless.
