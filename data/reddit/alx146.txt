The problem is that nobody knows the real price of bitcoin and everybody is struggling to understand what the real price should be. At the moment, the price reflects the balance of real supply from the miners and real demand from the users. 
The arbitration does minimise price inconsistencies, but only if the market is large, because in this case the futures price does not affect the underlying price. If the futures price is too high or too low then people can profit from the price difference between real and the futures price, removing the price inconsistencies.
However, for a small market, which crypto market is, an artificial supply of 'paper bitcoins' could easily drive down the demand for real bitcoins, thus affecting the actual/underlying price.
Therefore, I still do not see how it could be a good news for bitcoin but I would be happy if someone corrects me if/where I am wrong. 
p.s. by 'good news' I mean going to the moon of course :)

One way to prevent this from happening would be making sure that bitcoin has real utility in addition to being a storage of value. In this case, it will be the scarcity of 'physical' tokens that would dictate the price, and not the manipulations by the banks.

wouldn't it reduce demand for bitcoin similar to the way paper gold reduces demand for physical gold and thus keeps  the price down?

Your explanation works well for *ordinary shorts*, which are considered good because they can remove inefficiencies in the market. 
However, when the sellers practice "naked shorts", the  seller does not have to buy an asset before selling, creating an opportunity to manipulate the market.

Your explanation does not work because CME futures will be cash-settled, no bitcoin changes hands. What this means is that a seller can sell bitcoins it does not have, increasing the supply and driving the price down.
