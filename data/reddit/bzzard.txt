Anything on this site. I have youtube and other with infinite number of HD60fps great content movies for free.

Users will get coins by their *current* BTC balance (20-25%)?
What are plans for users with fiat?
@_date: 2014-08-28 19:03:15

@_date: 2014-03-29 13:53:12

@_date: 2014-11-22 19:06:48
or try
@_date: 2014-07-01 05:38:24
@_date: 2014-06-27 15:05:26
This is a question. Some say you should do rollback to pre gox-crash time (for me current balance is ok).
So users with USD balance will get % from that 200k coins (in BTC). At what price, current from stamp?

If you want to prove you are really big exchange - please add full orderbook to API.
Currently you have only 1%-5% range
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:45:48
[BTCCharts](  right now MtGox websocket API is down so charts with no fallback to HTTP API can stop working

Don't forget to buy flight and hotel with bitcoin (btctrip.com, destinia, expedia)!
@_date: 2014-07-01 00:34:40
You mean - I can sell bitcoin there and get paper JPY?
@_date: 2014-11-12 04:23:26
 - very stable last months
If you dont like flash in browser - install desktop version
@_date: 2014-02-10 17:20:41
Yeah, I've got call today. Friend bought nice chunk of btc :)
@_date: 2014-09-16 08:28:39
Slower and not so chaotic - new improved Tina! :) Keep it going!
@_date: 2014-06-30 15:16:01
If you decide, please use simple array format - {asks:[[price, amount], ...], bids:[[price, amount], ...]}
@_date: 2014-01-07 09:38:34
Jeez people....
It's only 0.1btc - no reason to bother thousands of users with such a small case!
@_date: 2014-06-13 00:31:28
Nice :)
@_date: 2014-07-01 05:37:39
Check out Destinia (I was on two trips - no problem)
@_date: 2017-02-13 19:38:26
@_date: 2014-06-04 22:09:56
This is how it looked like:
(transparent orderbook is just before this sell)
Volume says there was max 10btc sell in that time, and you need at least 150BTC to clean off bid side, so this look like exchange glitch
@_date: 2017-02-15 20:07:32
0.15 jpy per every 1 goxjpy
This is the personal offer I got 2 weeks ago 
@_date: 2016-01-02 11:30:58
@_date: 2017-03-09 22:40:52

"...without ever having actually refuted the original position"
I was referring to that exact position:
"So it's just assumption there can be some problems on IE. Not other browsers (flash on IE is embedded in a specific way - other than other browsers). "At this time, no attacks exploiting these Flash Player vulnerabilities have been detected in the wild""
Then you make another argument that listing flash technology in some goverment vulnerability list is no good sign.
So, again, I proved to you that other technologies have a lot more vulnerabilities - this is referring to that exact position.
@_date: 2012-01-01 01:46:10
Can you provide link for this "unpatched remote security vulnerability" issue? Some more information?
@_date: 2012-01-01 08:22:13
Oh, ok thanks for link :)
So it's just assumption there can be some problems on IE. Not other browsers (flash on IE is embedded in a specific way - other than other browsers).
"At this time, no attacks exploiting these Flash Player vulnerabilities have been detected in the wild"
I think that if there will be some "hacking opportunity" flash will be dead in the nexy day. So far there's a more rumors than real hacking attempts. Just like with Bitcoins - peoples talking that this can be hacked ...but it's just echoes from events like Mtgox hack.
Google finance is using flash, peoples still perffer flash on youtube. etc
Closing to one technology just because it "can" be hacked is not good choice because ...everything can be hacked. You close your dors in home, but you know that dors can be "hacked". Yet you still live in that home and feel quite secure.
...anyway. I'm author of this site and I believe that Adobe is doing good job when it comes to security and flash (..not Adobe Reader). Just don't use IE and keep flash player updated, ...and enjoy charts that don't hog your CPU and simply works when there's bigger moves on stock.
Another attempt to attack $5! gogogo! :)

How much of this discount?
flyhi.fi had/have -10€/-5€ euro
@_date: 2012-01-01 18:12:32
flash - "There are 210 matching records"
...so let's check something seen as secure technology, let's say chrome:
* 
chrome - "There are 560 matching records"
You just proved that flash is secure technology (by your own standards).

My blockchain.info wallet forgot old (~2013) addresses on web version. Fortunately mobile version still "remembers" them. Yeah... no more blockchain.info...
@_date: 2015-09-02 03:49:44
 - I got some problems with them, but last months are good
@_date: 2017-05-19 12:37:03
3k wall @ finex is the party crasher
@_date: 2011-12-21 05:16:59
I'm working currently on live bitcoin charts site and there will be such a feature.
For now, I'm planning to launch this on Friday so there's no link yet.

There's  - I've bought from them multiple games and it just works (well, sometimes you must wait like 3 days). Bad thing they don't have all games.
@_date: 2013-10-04 14:07:56
Humm, looks like you guys are right. If this is not seized BTC, then folks on gox will likely rebuy those 36k (with big loss) - bullish
@_date: 2013-10-20 16:46:27
