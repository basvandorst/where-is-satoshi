You can do that to some degree but not with strong certainty. 


It's possible that the address with a lot of money is their own but they could also have spent the BTC, deposited it to an exchange, etc.
It's also fine to end up with 100s of addresses since this is automatically managed by wallets. Consolidating is not usually necessary (unless fees become an issue possibly).

Segwit had little support from miners prior to the Segwit2x agreement (aka New York Agreement). Miners started signalling for Segwit shortly after the agreement was announced. Some claim that the threat of UASF precipitated the agreement but I'm skeptical.

When an address cannot be parsed from an output script. Meaning that it's not one of the typical scripts (e.g. "Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash") but a "custom" script. Those transactions are typically generated by custom software rather than a regular Bitcoin wallet.
ELI5: funny looking transaction


An output that hasn't been spent yet. Your BTC balance is the sum of all the unspent outputs you control. Spent outputs are outputs that have been used in a previous transaction and are just using up space in the blockchain (but seriously, all transactions are recorded forever in the blockchain).
ELI5: current BTC balance


A software change that was recently introduced to Bitcoin. It does a [number of things]( like introduce a new transaction format and solves some annoyances (e.g. transaction malleability).
ELI5: recent Bitcoin software update


A standardised way for wallets to generates addresses consistently (deterministically) from a smallish seed. This makes it easier to backup/restore wallets among other things (you only need to record the smallish seed which can be encoded as a 12+ words passphrase).

Could it be possible that in the future, LN coins might become slightly more valuable than non-LN coins (and even more so as transaction fees increase).
Here's the reasoning:
Let's say 1 BTC is 10,000$ and transaction fee to open a LN channel is 0.01 BTC (100$). So the cost of funding a new LN channel with 1 BTC is 100$. Instead you could re-use an old LN channel and buy 1 BTC for 10,050$ through the LN network and save 50$. So the LN coins are worth 10,050$ while non LN coins are worth 10,000$. The difference could become much larger if transaction fees increase a lot.
Does that make sense?
edit: Never mind I had a brain fart and forgot that fees were fixed and not proportional to the BTC amount.
