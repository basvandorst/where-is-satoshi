Only tangentially related to Bitcoin, but the concept is super-interesting.

They are not relying on Bitcon's anonymity for anything in this project. And stop trying to paint Bitcoin as anonymous - it is not. 
They are using cryptography (specifically homomorphic encryption) to ensure that sensitive data isn't 'leaked' to the public but at the same time, the results are publicly verifiable.

Smart Contracts have been on Bitcoin since January 2009. RSK allows Turing Complete scripts to run.

I don't think this is correct. They've used Ethereum for proof of concept, but they are building a private, centralized, trusted, distributed ledger which is not remotely related to blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum at all.

Indeed! Here's how:  
You can get 0.67 hashes/day according to the article. Now get to work!

This is true in private blockchains only if the trade happens within the private network, i.e. not without an outside counterparty. What happens if the trade happens with another entity? We are back to where we began. With Bitcoin, it doesn't matter who does the trade - anyone can be guaranteed of its validity.

Check out Coinality, it's pretty good with original listings as well as listings from places like Upwork.

It's not a price markup, because you can sell at the same price as you can buy at. It's just a spread from Coinbase prices.

I am the founder of BTC Geek ( and I can confirm that BTC Geek is not owned or operated by Garza or anyone related to GAW Miners. Further, I can confirm that BTC Geek has never sold advertising space to GAW Miners, although the uses third-party advertisers (Adsense, CoinURL) which may have shown an ad related to GAW Miners. 
(Also, BTC Geek is much older than GAW Miners).

I agree, the tickets are a bit on the expensive side. The recent conference in Chicago had tickets at a more reasonable $100 for the conference.

In addition to coinbase and circle (which might take a while, considering you have to link accounts and prove identity), try localbitcoins especially if you live in a larger city. Might be the fastest way to buy Bitcoins, especially if you want to buy them soon. Make sure you take adequate precautions and download a secure mobile wallet (e.g. breadwallet for iOS, mycelium for Android)
@_date: 2016-03-30 18:41:35
On the other hand, just because you call something a blockchain, doesn't make it "like-Bitcoin". What DAH is building here has nothing to do with Bitcoin. Try saying something like "non-SQL database to revolutionaize the $1 tn of repos" and then ask does this have anything to do with Bitcoin? The answer is usually no. 
Industrial acceptance of 'blockchains' will not affect Bitcoin positively. Sure, there are some great works especially in the Hyperledger project and I wish them well. However, this has nothing to do with Bitcoin except tangentially.

Good luck. How do you know when the next bubble happens, LTC will outperform BTC by 3-5x? Are you basing this on the last bubble performance?

The best way to know where to buy altcoins is to check out the coin on Coinmarketcap and look at the exchanges. For BBQcoin, check out  and see that it is only traded on Bter among the major exchanges. Be careful - Bter was hacked previously and there are several horror stories about the exchange. If you want to take the risk, just go in-out quickly and withdraw your BBQcoin. 
I won't even dare to ask why you would like to buy BBQcoin, but am curious nonetheless. 
@_date: 2016-03-28 11:01:56
This is not the right forum to ask for altcoin investment advice. Try some other subs on reddit, or go through Bitcointalk threads asking similar questions every other day.

Not sure of public updates, but the alpha is scheduled in April and public testnet in July.

I think the part that is lacking is more in the 'how to build applications' side of things. If you're interested in how the network works, Mastering Bitcoin is fairly good and comprehensive. 21 tutorials address some of the application side of things, but I think a more comprehensive resource would be great. 
@_date: 2016-01-24 18:54:13
The Mastering Bitcoin book is excellent if you want to program Bitcoin itself, not build applications around it. If you're looking for something more solid from a development perspective as opposed to protocol-level details, some of the 21 tutorials are pretty good. I think you might like them.

How are you withdrawing money from a US bank? Is it via ACH? If so, doesn't it take 2 days at a minimum to clear? (Are you assuming the risk by making it instantaneous?) I don't know how the Mexican banking system works, but does it have instantaneous deposits? 
@_date: 2017-01-02 21:35:53
Ok, clear is probably the wrong word in this context, but the bank to which you transferred money won't make it available for at least 2 days, and sometimes 3. customer's bank -&gt; your bank -&gt; Bitcoin exchange - each step will take 2 days to send and is not instantaneous. Are you going to use a credit line from a bank then? 
Great service, by the way. Please post important statistics, would be great to know how much volume is going through.

What's the current position on posts related to altcoins on r/bitcoin? I ask because previously there were a number of posts on several altcoins (both promising ones and outright scams) that were allowed on this sub. It is unclear to me how these are going to be moderated going forward. Is a discussion around, say, Ethereum, allowed? What about an altcoin that a Bitcoin mining pool might start? 
@_date: 2015-07-19 16:00:05
There is this company called Prypto in the UK, not sure how active they are right now. They made quite pretty gift cards too. 
@_date: 2016-02-11 01:02:30
There is a 28-day period and minimum of 75% consensus required to activate this, so no, you can't mine a block bigger than 1 MB using Classic at the moment.

This is great news for Bitcoin! 
Is there any documentation from the Stratis team on the implementation of this, including what the requirements are for Masternodes that presumably process these transactions?

Yeah, it's been very slow and unstable last couple of days for me as well.

Also important to remember that she was present at the GAW Miners booth at the Miami conference - TNABC a few months ago, and insisted she was never ever paid by GAW for coming to the conference or promoting them, and she was there only to support a great company that she loved, as a happy customer.

No they aren't. There is in fact no buy-sell spread on Circle, i.e. you get quoted one single price at which you can buy or sell Bitcoin. This price tends to be higher than Coinbase's. If you have a ton a Bitcoin, you can sell at Circle for a higher price than Coinbase.

Which 'Governments'? If a country tries to ban Bitcoin, they won't be able to really enforce it, and they'll drive the innovation to another country. It seems highly unlikely that US, Russia, China, Iran, Equador and every other country would come to a consensus that they should all collectively ban crypto-currencies.

cex.io is popular. Cloud Hashing also sells some mining shares. I am not aware of any such features for Litecoins though, I'd be interested to know as well. There are always people in the forums who want to sell you some hashing power if you're that interested. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 08:07:30
Any specific part or all of it? I'll try my best to explain. 
Bitshares can be put as collateral against BitAssets. BitAssets is the thing that tracks anything - Bitcoin, Apple Stock, Gold, or anything really. The 'trading' happens against the BitAssets. You can go both long and short, so you can create pairs like BitApple/BitGold for example, which would track the price of AAPL/Gold in the market. Same with any other pairs.
