The mods listened to community feedback and reduced the ban from 90 days to 48 hours. That's a lot more than can be said about the manipulative behavior of mods in Defining "altcoins" as any discussion they don't like, changing default sort orders and score displays so community feedback on their terrible, childish moderating gets stifled.

We all know what "side" the mods are on. It's a message to them.


Nice slippery slope, but it won't work. Downvoting is part of Reddit which is a private business. I assume you know that and are just grasping for straws here.

You don't have any idea what a source means, do you? I'll give you a hint: it doesn't mean just taking your word that something is true. 
@_date: 2015-12-08 21:21:24
I agree that downvotes weren't meant to be used for disagreement, in that regard you're right. However, when a group of moderators are  enacting censorship with the explicit purpose of squelching disagreement, there is little recourse. In addition, downvoting doesn't  censor that content at all, it merely hides it, so if someone wants to read it they're free to. This is in stark contrast to the heavy handed moderation of this subreddit, which almost nobody wants, and which removes discussion permanently. 
The downvotes are a reaction to the awful moderation. Remove that element and discussion will thrive.

That would change things, but right now as far as I've seen it isn't.

With something like illegal drugs, their banishment increases the costs of selling them which lowers the supply. The demand is less elastic, which increases the price.
But with Bitcoin, the supply is a less elastic. I'm sure how the demand would be changed. Point is, it's a different market and I think if the US or EU banned Bitcoin the price would fall a lot more than something like drugs.

If you think it doesn't work, you don't get to censor discussion and enforce the will of a few over everyone. That isn't a better alternative.
If you think Reddit doesn't produce a good discussion, all you have to do is leave.

Sure, here's some feedback: stop abusing your positions as moderators and manipulating discussion. Let users discuss Bitcoin as they see fit.

"If you allocate any resources towards it" makes it seem like small companies have an infinite supply of resources that they can simply scale up and down as things change. That's not how the world works. The world has 40 hour a week limits. The world has a massive string of legislation dictating how you can and can't hire someone, and how that person can work once you do. 
I guess in some theoretical capacity customer service is easy, in the sense that you have to answer the phone and email and help people. Look at the price and volume of Bitcoin sales. Combine that with, have you ever had to go through the process of hiring an employee? Try doing that in time with the price and volume of Bitcoin sales the way they are. It is insanely difficult.

Word from someone in this thread is it was a whale who sold off at $900 that caused it. Not the bubble a lot of us thought it was, supposedly.

You are both right. After "the World Wide Web" developed technology innovated allowing normal people to participate. It became easier, but people also slowly learned these technologies at the same time. People soon learned what a "web browser" was once they started being capable of displaying images, you could buy computer with a "modem" installed, etc.
The same analogy can be applied to e-commerce.
