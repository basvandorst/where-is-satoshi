Because Google is freakin' sweet, but a bit creepy sometimes, I'll admit.

Keep in mind that you're in a search filter bubble. Google has learned your interests and will surround you with ads related to trading of all kinds. 
There are many variables that Google looks at when returning your results.  It uses past searches, region, your browser type, what ads you've clicked on, where you shop, [third-party accounts you've authorized]( browsing history and **most interesting** [inferred interests and demographics](  You can test this by:   
* performing a search and then signing out of Google, closing the tab, clearing cookies and opening a new tab to start a new session then doing the search again noting how the results change.
* using a browser you don't normally use like Opera.
* *search for the term using  Adding "!g" at the end of your search query returns Google results and keeps you from being at tracked.*
One variable you can't control is which data center is returning the results. There are a few in the US and some internationally.  Which one you hit is random and varies with each use.  Data centers are consistent with one another but a few are different because they are not using the same algorithm.
