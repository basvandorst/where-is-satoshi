I might just suck it up and do coinbase actually since there is an even lower chance of being scammed.

I am thinking of using [this guy.]( He was the most secure person I could find. What do you think and where can I find his offers?
@_date: 2014-03-24 23:22:19
[I posted a thread]( to find out how trust worthy they are. No one has posted yet though.

Thanks so much. This is exactly what I am looking for.
@_date: 2014-03-24 20:29:16
I do not want to give credit card or bank account because identity is very annoying and time consuming.

Nevermind found it in your walkthrough, but I want to buy at least .25 Bitcoin and your offer is higher priced than others and it says you are currently on vacation or out of bitcoin. Can you offer a lower price and are you really out of bitcoin?

I do not want to use them because they require a credit card or bank info. I do not want to give credit card or bank account because identity is very annoying and time consuming.

Could people explain why they trust coinbase with their bank account? Are you worried about identity theft? If not why? I would like to buy bitcoin in the most secure way, but I am nervous about the security of my personal information.

Sorry for the noob question, but where can I find your current sell offers?
@_date: 2014-03-24 22:29:44
OK I don't insist on WU, but I don't want to meet someone either.
@_date: 2014-02-22 01:58:24
No one ever pays me in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-24 23:28:07
I do not think everyone has my bank information.
@_date: 2014-03-24 22:38:34
And risk being scammed, correct? All of the options I see say send the money first.
@_date: 2014-03-24 23:29:50
I will be pulling my coins immediately. I am just worried about identity theft. Do you have evidence other than your opinion that it is legit?
@_date: 2014-03-24 20:31:27
Coinbase is one way that is unlikely to scam you, but I do not want to give the personal information.
@_date: 2014-03-24 20:32:29
OK, what is a method of buying bitcoins that won't involve giving bitcoin that won't involve giving credit card information or bank account information?
