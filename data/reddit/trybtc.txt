Withdrawal page broken:






First deposit showed up immediately and second to same address not appearing after more than 30 minutes.

I don't stop my day to insult people. I realize others get their point across by insulting people but I'm just observing human nature here.

I don't want someone else deciding that for me or anyone else. If some significant # of bitcoins aren't in active circulation (whether lost or not) adjusting the decimal fully accounts for divisibility lost, and scarcity increases the value of all remaining bitcoins in active circulation.

BTCSportsMatch.com operates by booking bets between people with only a 1% fee on wins. Uses same software.

If a sale in an attempt to depress prices is planned, doing it on the weekend is ideal.

Thank you.

Bet terms you've posted are accurate, but if he doesn't make good next week it is a default.

Synopsis: "Can online currencies solve some of the miseries of this material world? Bitcoin seems to the online currency of choice these days, although online security fears and allegations that it's a haven for money-laundering have undermined its reputation. We assess what bitcoin is with a British cyber-policeman, Mick Jameson, a Bitcoin currency dealer, Donald Norman of bitcoinconsultancy.com, and the Greek economist Yanis Varoufakis, who's now investigating the potential of online currencies with digital games-maker, Valve. Are these currencies safe and do they have a future?"

If the ransom was legit, I think there was a better chance of scoring $1M in bitcoins by getting people who want to see the documents to send money.

EFF may want to defend Bitcoin in the future and some believe accepting it could be viewed as a conflict of interest.
@_date: 2012-08-16 13:06:02
This is why the original post for the site needed to be downvoted. It's one thing to give a new small retailer visibility but a huge undertaking like a financial trading platform needs extreme scrutiny or legitimate backing before showcasing it with upvotes.

Really the only adjustment should be increasing divisibility by adding more decimal places.

Oldest/most trusted bitcoin sports betting site is BTCSportsBet.com. The vig can be a little high, but there's a lesser-known sister site at BTCSportsMatch.com that offers p2p wagers at vig-free lines.
@_date: 2012-08-17 18:50:43
No (at least not yet). A default is missed and/or non-payment. If funds with interest are returned early there is no default.

The use-value of bitcoin beyond its monetary functions is effectively nil (with respect to the idea that losing one might diminish the whole). You're on the right track when you acknowledge that any lost units can always be overcome by allowing more decimal places. This is absolutely different than the use-value loss brought about by the destruction or loss of a precious metal.

Get on BTCSportsMatch.com. It's run by the BTCSportsBet.com owners but is kept less advertised because you only pay 1% vig on winning bets (site started as a way for respected gambling forum members to book action for each other). All bets are booked by other members but action is good and people are friendly. Usually 100+ btc booked on major games.
@_date: 2012-08-24 18:47:06
Really pleased by the author's growing understanding of Bitcoin.

Although, things like Blockchain.info Wallet integration can offer big advantages for SatoshiDice moving forward.

Don't use Mt. Gox for trading without reporting accurate capital gains.
@_date: 2012-08-18 12:34:15
Can you explain? The system itself can't be responsible for "password recovery" without severely damaging attributes of security and anonymity.
@_date: 2012-08-17 23:21:08
Lost bitcoins merely increase the value of everyone else's.
@_date: 2012-08-19 03:14:32
Buying BTC for someone else through Mt. Gox should be much safer for audit purposes than buying and selling (creating auditable capital gains) in the same account there.
@_date: 2012-08-23 00:04:50
The whole reason scams like this are possible is people see a token gesture like 100 out of 500,000 BTC paid out or initial interest payments and start thinking something is legit. At the start, ponzis use token payments to get the uninformed to accept things that are virtually impossible (like 7% weekly interest).

Thanks for the correction for others. Address was on the site initially. I'm not scamming. Comment deleted.

Any compilation of these? What states have been claimed?

This article should be the top post of this subreddit. It's Dan Kaminsky writing a long piece on Bitcoin. C'mon. Don't let a poor title by Wired keep people/you from reading it.
Here is the exact sort of person we want reading, writing, and thinking about Bitcoin.

Sportsbetting represents the ultimate verifiable gambling because results are public outcomes. BTCSportsMatch.com seems to be the best place for action these days with all wagers booked between players and the lowest house take anywhere (1% of winning bets).

Posted in the r/Gaming and another subreddit Humble Bundle thread two days ago and got ridiculed and down voted. I'm smiling now.

Very cool. Company is the definition of legit - old, established, BBB A+ rating, etc.

This is Timothy Lee's first Bitcoin story at the Washington Post. He no longer writes for Ars Technica and Forbes. The quote comes from Jerry Brito of Mercatus at GMU, a described Bitcoin enthusiast.

Bet versus others at the best lines. 1% of winning bet only. One of the oldest with lots of large gamblers on the site.

I'm not so convinced as Jon.

Until 5 Dimes, Pinnacle or Bovada take bitcoins, I'd keep sports betting at BTCSportsBet.com (vs house) and BTCSportsMatch.com (vs others). They are easily the two oldest and largest BTC sports betting sites.

The block reward is the max the miner can claim. A miner can claim less than but no more than 25 BTC at the moment.

Be careful with new sites like this. Several have come and gone with player funds.

Important to read if only because it is by a professional economist, with Greece background even.

Be extremely cautious about using sites like this. Your short link gets redirected and you have a problem.
