What is this amateur hour?
You may as well have left 8.5k on a random sidewalk.
And lol @ you made some "great investments" that more than doubled your money. No, you speculated and got lucky in a frenzied bull market. That's not investing. And if your coins hadn't been "stolen" due to your carelessness and complete lack of basic security awareness you would have lost it all within another month anyways by gambling it.

Who would even pay tax on BTC... If you're gona cash out just do it slowly and in hard cash. Pay your bills with BTC etc. They have no way of knowing how much you have.

That's an extremely flawed and naive viewpoint. When there is this much money on the line, you can pretty much guarantee that there are motivated adversaries willing to steal it.
You think that criminals avoid stealing from high net-worth individuals because of the threat of violence deters them? LOL it happens all the time. See Bernie Madoff.
That revenue you speak of is nothing compared to the sums that could be stolen, not to mention that the revenue doesn't flow equally to everyone in the company. Someone always get greedy and with BTC it's almost too tempting because getting away with it is a piece of cake if you know what you're doing.
Plenty of vulns go unnoticed by "security enthusiasts", see the DAO for example (there are a lot more examples). Don't just assume that someone else has done the due diligence. Not to mention that whoever controls the webservers and private keys could just selectively push out vulnerable updates.
I'd never use a hardware wallet for anything more than what I'd be OK with losing. For larger amounts, it's cold paper wallets all the way.

Is that because you have no friends?

Grads on 150k+ salaries? Sounds fairly dubious. Please provide some evidence that there are grads earning that much.

Not true. Plenty of investments have fixed &amp; predictable returns.

This thread is stupid. You're bragging about high risk behavior that has paid of in this instance (for now, although you haven't even realized any gains). You're encouraging other impressionable people to behave in a risky manner because they too want to become millionaires without adding any value, and many will lose a lot of money.
Acting like BTC is some sort of infallible investment is idiotic. If you don't understand the risks then you haven't researched it enough. Throughout history plenty of people have also speculated on some new technology/idea and made a fortune, only to lose it all because they had all their eggs in the one basket and it all went to shit.
I'm heavily invested in BTC too and have been holding since early 2013. I could have been a millionaire too if I had put more into it, I certainly had the means to, but nothing is certain and I could have also lost it all. So I stayed diversified and I hedge my risks across multiple different asset classes. I sleep a lot better at night.

You really think the IRS is going to go through all of your crypto transactions, different blockchains etc, and try and figure out what you owe? That's ridiculous. Unless you're dealing with 6+ figures trades I wouldn't worry about it, and even then I doubt they'd come after you when there's easier targets. This tax FUD is comical.

I think it's a very real problem. You could receive a batch of coins with a "tainted" history, and then have issues unloading them on exchanges that use blacklists.

In terms of liquid assets it's mainly cash (physical &amp; in bank), bonds (via ETFs) &amp; stocks (ETF mix of local, and international shares), and I'll be getting into residential property very soon. I have about $82K of BTC&amp;BCH, it's about 15% of my portfolio.

It's not unstoppable, that's a ridiculous assertion. Being overly optimistic and ignoring all of the serious risks/threats means that you're gambling and have your blinders on.
@_date: 2018-03-09 12:30:32
Ever think that taxes are different in different jurisdictions?

What fungibility? Bitcoin isn't fungible at all.

Regardless of what you use, always check that the hashes for the files you download are valid and signed with the author's PGP key.
Also don't neglect backups. Make sure you have CURRENT backups of your deterministic wallet seed stored securely.

Unfortunately we still live in reality. Not some Utopian ideal.

There's no such thing as karma. It's some fictional feelgood bullshit.
Lol if you think the police will do anything. They don't even have the capabilities to investigate something like this.
@_date: 2017-09-25 03:04:26
Not really censorship resistant when it's not fungible, and like you said when centralized exchanges are still needed to convert to fiat.
