I’m not a big trump fan or anything but I agree so many people talk like he’s some moron. I mean he still runs a multi billion dollar company and is the president of the United States and got famous before that. You don’t do all of that when you’re a moron

Been holding for two years and I’m still basically negative/even. Mind you I was up like 9x In 2017. Some coins of mine like Neo even 20x.
Could have had a life changing amount of money, but I held. And I still am. My point is, this advice works to a certain point but it means nothing if you don’t sell for a profit

Just give them to me and I’ll carry all of the burden of uncertainty! Just think how great you will feel.

What’s the conversion to schrute bucks?
@_date: 2019-09-28 18:17:34
Could you elaborate as to why? 
Do you mean it’s good or just expected

Simple supply and demand. The supply in terms of miner reward is halved so the price will rise as demand increases to meet the lowered supply
