I understand that we need a card at the moment but ultimately is the concept of plastic superseded by phone? I mean I don't even use my fiat card anymore. I just tap my phone. With bitcoin I feel like we won't need a credit card, or even an intermediary such as this in the future. I mean people travel in Thailand with out a credit card, just bitcoin.

What does everyone think of crypto debit cards?  I mean the type which you preload and the spend. Like crypto.Com and others? It seems stupid. I mean in the short term OK, it is handy to be able to spend at retailers and online, but it seems a little redundant. In ten years time, more retailers will accept crypto than ever before. And in the less developed world probably more so than the West. Why use a payment network to pay into a payment network? I k ow of people travelling in Thailand with bitcoin, and not having to use thier credit card. I feel like the " crypto debit card" is like a temporary bridge and will be useless. Seems stupid but I can't connect the dots in my head. Why wouldn't you just pay direct to thier wallet? With lightning and some other coins it practically as fast and getting faster. Or am I crazy?

I don't know man, I've used thier wallet. It sucks, buying through their wallet is expensive. Their fees are high and they have a time delay on transfers out. Have they enabled segwit yet? I just don't think they are necessarily needed. Good luck. Bitcoin for ever am I right?

I've been on the website. I just don't think it will be needed in the future. If you look ten years out, I think there will be much more widespread adoption in the western world, (probably even more so in developing worlds, that the visa and mastercard networks may be superseded., I mean isn't that what bitcoin is?? A peer to peer payment network. It seems like mco is a good idea in the short term. But ultimately unnecessary.

This is a suckers rally.

Oh dear good sir you have bested me! pshaw! I don't understand irony. How foolish of me. Well that's what happens because I have such a poor education! You get fucked too, you smug fuck.

Is anyone thinking to buy Facebook stock? I certainly won't use this shit coin but a large captive Facebook user base will, essentially turning Facebook into the world's first global bank. Shiiit. I think their stock might do well out of it.

Waaa I'm so upset. Well doesn't matter what you think. We'll be in charge soon. Too bad for you.

OK boomer. Keep reading newscorp and forming your own opinion on an entire hard-working generation. I have never read anything so offensive, to just dismiss an entire generation. As lazy and stupid. Get fucked.

Hold above 5200 and its officially a bull. 21 month ema is 5200. Should see some auto buys if we push up a little more. If not..... Down down. 
@_date: 2019-04-25 03:42:46
What do you reckon guys? Are we going down today? Doesn't seem like there's much ooomph after the "Golden Cross"
@_date: 2019-04-26 03:41:31
Welcome to the whipsaw.
@_date: 2019-04-09 09:19:04
I reckon we're going down tonight kids. 5200 is the real resistance. Not 5000. And we've smashed into it twice and not beaten it. Have your cash ready to buy this dip. Hopefully one last touch at 3500 then we're off to the races.

I understand your argument. But I wasn't referring to the dangers of hyperinflation. (although it's a major flaw of cash) more so the private nature and transactional ability without a third, monitoring party. Please read the article and the arguments put forward as to the use of cash or as we are working towards, digital cash like bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 04:52:16
I was more referring to government surveillance by the stasi and the nazi party in our parents and grandparents lifetime. And how the objectives of a governing body can become twisted and corrupted by the ideology of individuals. We can remember in recent history the power and danger of a corrupt political system that killed millions of people. And to that point the German people understand the ruthless efficiency unchecked government bureaucracy in stripping away human rights. Cash is private. It allows you to transact on a private basis with out government and corporate oversight. Bitcoin is digital cash. It allows you to transact without the oversight or control of government and corporate interests. My argument is that the Germans would love crypto if they knew. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 05:06:58
That's my point. It goes like this: bitcoin is greater than gold. Gold is greater than cash. Cash is greater than card.

Exactly!
