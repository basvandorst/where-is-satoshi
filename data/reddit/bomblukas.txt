I want to force Satoshi out of hiding.

It's an altcoin actually (like Namecoin), not a botnet.  It doesn't brute force the problem, but the solution isn't much more elegant.  It algorithmically solves the problem, but in a huge number of steps.  This problem can be split up among people without duplication of work.

I'm not really interested in this problem since I don't intend to completely break encryption.  But I'll play along..
There's still safety in large numbers (and small bank accounts).  If together we can all break 1 address per week, then you know that we're only going to go after addresses with large amounts of bitcoin.  i.e.  probably not yours.
Plus, if everyone knew which address we were going after, then you could easily move your money if it was your address.

The main point of the altcoin is to provide the service of breaking NP-Complete problems, not to compete with Bitcoin.
I am just worried about what would happen to Bitcoin if I made this and it actually worked.

Well, my thought is that Bitcoin would be small fry compared to what would happen if I made a distributed problem solver.
But this wouldn't solve P?=NP.  NP is defined as the problems solvable by a non-deterministic computer in polynomial time.  I'd just be making a non-deterministic computer.
