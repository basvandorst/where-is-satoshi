More money = more taxes, more jobs, better economical growth..etc
Any government with some sort of futuristic vision will already so everything they can do support crypto currencies and funnel that new wealth in their country.
The Swiss are already ahead with that. That’s why Zug is like the crypto capital of the world. Tons of new companies opened there (more jobs, more jobs is more taxes, more income for the government. 
You can buy houses with Bitcoin there (which you pay property tax on it forever). Most governments will be okay with crypto as long as they can tax it and regulate it. 
Weak governments will see it as a threat which you can already see with all those countries making it illegal. 
You can’t ban crypto because there will always be a country that welcomes that new generated wealth in its economy.

Try to login from another machine and see if your Bitstamp BTC deposit address keep switching like you are saying. 
If that address switching is only on one machine then most probably you have some sort of malware on it. 
Deposit addresses in almost all exchanges usually never change. At least I haven’t seen an exchange that does that so far.

Hardware wallet is best option to hold those coins you mentioned. Ledger is cheapest and easiest option. Just make sure to order from the official website of course.

It will be written in the top right corner in the Ledger App the chain name you are using. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 12:33:36
Is that the case with LTC, ETH or just the BTC  is the one that keep on switching?

Bitstamp deposit address does not change. Something is wrong. If Bitstamp address changes then you need to contact their support immediately.

Crypto funds/any person with large amount of BTC use cold storage which are totally disconnected from the internet. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 09:15:56
In such situations people just buy face to face using websites like 
I would however use Monero in that case just to avoid getting any tainted Bitcoins by mistake. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:19:09
Seems they did have a technical problem 
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:25:21
Most probably because it’s a legacy account the transaction size is just too big. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:11:45
This is absolutely wrong. 
Bitcoins are NOT fungible and your account WILL get frozen if you ever tried to transfer tainted coins to an exchange.

They do that regularly at airports despite it being “illegal”

Coinbase is the only exchange with a user friendly UI and App. All other exchanges are clueless when it comes to user experience. 
That’s the only reason. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 09:04:49
Any decent exchange keep 95% of their funds in cold storage so at worst case scenario only 5% can get stolen.
That lazy idiot of bitgrail kept the entire amount in a hot wallet.

BTC is currently at  57% discount of its at times high. 
It’s still a “dip”

END OF DAYS!

Bitstamp got no limits on withdrawal or deposits. They also have free withdrawals fees. Pretty decent exchange.

Usually those are hot wallets. Sometimes the criminals negotiate as well in return for the keys if the data was encrypted so no, they don’t always manage to seize everything.

Invest maximum 20% of your savings in crypto if you are young. Remaining 80% you are better off investing in good stocks and simply having good savings account.

This is a fairly common thing. Again BTC is not a fungible asset. Privacy coins like Monero are fungible, BTC is not.
This is a very serious thing since you can easily end up in a criminal investigation simply by buying some BTC from a stranger on localcoins for example. 
Please don’t treat BTC as a fungible asset. It is not. For now at least.

Was that the very first time you try to withdraw money from Coinbase?
