You placed a limit order to sell at 18 or higher.

I agree. But I interpreted his question as being related solely to what saroshi meant in that statement, which I think is ultimately, diversity. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:50:43
Adopt don’t buy :(

Tipping positive and smart opinions might be an awesome way to promote quality content on this sub. Yay. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:47:40
Diversify.

Well yes I meant its value. 
I don't think the fluctuations in its value are proportional to the decrease in value of fist currencies though, in just one week it went down to 1000 then back up to 1200 dollars. Of course we know why that is. But assuming its value is related directly to the decrease in value of other currencies seems wrong to me.

Cool I'll take a look. I thought there was more to it. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 18:07:51
I wouldn't call it the most exciting tech since the invention of the internet. Personally, quantum computers are way cooler!
@_date: 2017-03-12 19:28:52
I'm not questioning the fact that it fluctuates in itself, just trying to see what makes it fluctuate. It's hard to say since it's decentralized etc
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:27:52
That’s like asking if a 100 dollar bill loses its value once you put it in your pocket. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:48:57
Yeah I started out with exactly that formula. But I got greedy last night and leveraged way more then I should've (aka my full BTC capital) and paid for it.
I'm going to buy at some point in the future when I can and I'll HODL like a good boy. Just need to make some money first.

Bitmex offers 100x leverages.

Very interesting article! Maybe we should port for a proof of work system that does more meaningful work in that case. However I’m not sure how one would implement such a system since I don’t know if we necessarily know the criteria to be able to verify work as legitimate in some cases.

because then they couldn't guarantee I'd be able to pay them back.

I had 0 problems with QuadrigaCX. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:51:17
10K on QuadrigaCX!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:25:30
+1 reason 
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:39:18
It was liquidated
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:36:26
Same... except I leveraged everything after holding for a long time and lost it all because im a dumbass.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:26:27
BCH? Everyone here just says it’s dead?
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:56:26
Which alt coins are the most important to you?
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:45:25
50x at 7954. Should've sold when I hit 8000.
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:43:45
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:30:23
Add quadrigaCX
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:52:36
Because I thought we were headed for about 8100 before a dip. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:23:02
Eventually it got so low the person who gave me the loan forced me to sell to guarantee his losses (person being the exchange).
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:03:34
Leveraged 50x at 7954, it went down and got liquidated.
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:19:37
What do you think about implementing this in bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:21:45
Yeah, I just needed it to go up to about 8050, it did but before I bought in. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:37:01
It was liquidated.
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:31:05
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:23:13
I would be really interested in a small how to write up. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:41:26
Got cleaned out unfortunately
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:39:28
I went long xd
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:22:41
I understand leverage, but I just miscalculated partly because I didn’t think S2x would have a huge effect. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 03:43:16
Too many Germans unfortunately.

The history of France was not sad. You leave out of many large parts of history.
