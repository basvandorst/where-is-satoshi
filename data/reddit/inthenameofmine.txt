That's why its good for IOUs only (fiat, stocks, bonds, credit relationships, financial contracts, etc) because the quantity and quality of the IOUs always fully depends on the issuing company (which has the centralized ledger) anyway.
Issuing an IOU token on something like counterparty/openassets is pointless because that would mean handling an IOU into a bearer token, which is the equivalent of trying to square a circle. Just like you can't replicate BTCs properties through IOUs, so too you could not have IOU properties on the BTC blockchain (or any fully decentralized ledger for that matter).


The same way it technically legally already happens. The illigitimate property is not recognized (by lets say a court) and a new property representative of the actual legal property ownership relationship is created on the blokchain. The old property will not be included in future blocks based on the court order (this al only makes sense with politically centralized blockchains).

Ripple could "work" without XRP, but then their pathfinding mechanism most likely would be convoluted. XRP is the only token on the system which behaves like commodity money and therefore has no counterparty. As such, and because it was around from the beginning on the network it has the deepest order book between itself and all other IOUs on the system. Ripple effectively uses a Minimum Spanning Tree pathfinding algorithm and as such XRP is used in most cases as the shortest path.
It works actually exactly the way Bitcoin works today combined with the exchanges, just that in Ripple the exchanges' order books are on the ripple ledger.

Together with the data (example would be an API setup just like today) they also provide the data's hash and hash chain. The hash chain itself can be stored with any node, or even on a distributed network such as BTC. That way if the data you receive does not match the previous hash chain you know you got fake/inconsistent data.
You can go even further, where it really becomes awesome. If the server from which you request data has as it's genesis block an UUID a "genesis contract" which effectively is a hash of it's open source program, then you can independently verify whether the data you got is valid/possible within that program's parameters. This is the same as BTC nodes being able to independently verify transaction validity without actually doing the mining.
People are starting to call this "Paranoid server-client setup", and it might be very useful for high counterparty risk industries.

From their perspective BTC is a traditional TTP network with 4 known entities controlling the network state transition. In BTCs case they however don't have a contractual obligation to the network users at all.
@_date: 2015-06-25 20:48:41
Blockchains (even centralized one's) make it possible to do independent state and state transition verification of the data on the blockchain. It's essentially a database which records each and every change to it with a verifiable GIT hash. If you then upload some checkpoint or block header hash to another notarizing blockchain (like BTC for example) you get all the upsides of BTC without any of its downsides. That is what BitPay's ChainDB, Eris' ErisDB, and the Singapore hackathon OmniChain propose and do.
There's tons of other purposes though. At Bitsapphire we regularly talk to people with the most varying use cases.

Obviously Merkle Trees and hash chains (e.g. GIT or Hash chain) have been around forever.
What I mean is I have never seen an actual database that does a GIT-like hash of the current state of a database at *every* state change. (I have only seen that for secure backup of database dumps) + where the write only happens if the pub key matches the permissions on the db, the permissions being not user based but crypto based.

I think Daniel from the "Nakamoti Institute" had an intereting and relatively good analysis about Appcoins. [It's a good read](
I think Bitcoin is an Appcoin too. It's current application is purely value transmission, but not storage, primarily due to its price fluctuations. Price fluctuations in turn happen because bitcoin is commodity money, meaning non-zero net supply, or in other words, outside money. You can read up on the outside money vs inside money issue [here](
As the Appcoin article stated, if you can't securly hold value for a long enough time in one coin, you will only use it for its application purpose (in bitcoin's case long distance or pseudonymous value transmission) for the duration of time necessary. This is happening now with coinbase, circle, bitpay, etc. You get in and then out. That's it.
It is right now the cheapest and most secure way for my clients to pay my company through (USD)Coinbase -&gt; Exchange(EUR). Payments are done in a matter of hours without exchange fees. This is incredible, but the value of bitcoin won't increase thought this transaction.

With a digital ledger converting between different currencies is seamless and you wouldn't even know about it. That was the initial idea of Ripple at least.
Your KansasBucks would be converted into the needed TrainBucks on the spot and the pricing would appear to you in your native currency.
Everybody would be able to issue credit themselves as long as there is demand for their services/products. No bank would be able to extract interest, no factional reserve banking, no debasement by governments. If your services are in demand, you won't have to beg anybody for their money, you just create credit and reimburse it with work provided. Everybody's credit currency would float against everybody else's credit currency. The blockchain would take car of the pairing.
This concept is called Producer Issued Credit. The concept is almost a hundred years old, but I think just now do we have the technical capabilities to actually do this in a practical manner.

We do Bitcoin and Blockchain [consulting]( though it's become a lot more [intricate]( than that lately.
The whole industry still isn't at the point where fortune 500 companies ask for Bitcoin or Blockchain consulting. R3 is at this point essentially a pooled research and consulting operation as far as I can see. Furthermore, most Fortune 500 companies have preferred suppliers for technology consulting, so it's mostly these outsourcing companies which are currently asking for educational consulting from us.
We work mostly with startups, which is pretty cool, with some corporate consulting in the mix. I think this is primarily why there are no good US based Bitcoin / Blockchain consultants. You can't get the broad expertise needed by working on a single project, you need to be a lot more tech agnostic. Currently the only way to get enough experience is by working with several startups, which in turn can't pay US-style corporate consulting rates, so traditional business models don't work. After all, companies pay you to make good choices, not to sell them a product (which is unfortunately what most "blockchain companies" do at the moment).
Don't get me started on the Bitcoin/Blockchain "investors" and VCs. They've burned through a lot of money. Most Bitcoin startup investments are pretty much criminal if you start to analyze how the deals came to be. Pretty much defrauding fund investors. Institutional / VC Investors generally don't pay people to do due diligence because they can externalize the risk onto the fund Investors.

Actually, it's much more dependent on the transaction confirmation time of the nodes. Each node should check the validity of each transaction in each block it gets before further propagating the block.
As far as I know transaction validation time increases quadratically with each additional kb (transactions, not blocks). This is also why Gavin is proposing a 100 kb per transaction hard limit together with the 8 Mb block increase. Huge mltisig transactions or transactions with tons of inputs or outputs could easily fill a single block of any size. It would take a normal computer more than the block propagation time to validate a single block with a transaction of a few MBs. This is why we need also reverse bloom lookup tables so desperately, so we don't need to validate each transaction ion a block but rather only the one's we haven't received yet as a node.

The answer is more complex than most people would like. Commodities are priced in terms of fiat, therefore their price depends on the total supply of fiat in the market for that commodity. Fiat depends on credit creation, therefore if nobody is taking out loans -&gt; no new supply of fiat to go. People aren't taking out loans because nobody is spending. Spending in turn depends on loan creation. So as long as people don't take out loans we won't see gold, Bitcoin, etc rise.
@_date: 2016-02-14 15:33:44
Technically that is not quite correct. Bitcoin is somewhere in between your analogy of AOL and the internet. AOL is a state machine while the internet is a protocol (meaning stateless).Bitcoin is a state machine, without being one I could not have a single updateable ledger. So in that sense it is closer to AOL than the internet. However, its state transition (new blocks) are determined through a DMMS (Dynamic Multi Member Dynamic Signatures) unlike AOL which is centrally controlled.
@_date: 2016-02-09 12:52:20
That's another misconception. QE just shuffled the balance sheets around, nothing more. The banks were overleveraged, meaning, they they loaned more than could possibly be repaid. In a sense, they created more money than was wanted in the economy. Then the government stepped in with QE. What they did was put all the unplayable loans on the governments balance sheet. All that money that the banks so on isn't actually used for loaning. It's there to prop up their lending ratio and make them seem more secure. Normally the banks would lend to one another for that, but the banks don't even trust their own risk profiles, let alone others. Therefore they need to keep as much fed money as possible at hand and be conservative with lending.Lending won't start until risk profiles of banks and businesses in the economy are again calculable. Till then we will see deflation (deleveraging) across the world, because that is how you de-risk your balance sheet.In this regard this crisis is completely different from everything that ever came before. The whole commodities / gold rising hedging paradigm does not hold in this case.

It is more cost effective to heat your home with a mix if wood (also illegaly cut and smuggled) and coal (mostly lignite). Most of the coal reserves are state owned and sell only ti big users, not small homes. 
Thus is why private individuals then grease sone hands in the state owned companues to get coal for free or very cheap at relatively small quantities and sell it then at below market price to individual homes.
This entire phenomenon is of course catastrophic for everyone as air quality is terrible, corruption spreads, real market incentives are destroyed, and the public looses out on taxes and income from public resources.

Hi Joe, you're doing fantastic work!
I have a few questions.
How do you think will you scale the production of the car? Is it automation friendly, meaning, is it build so that existing industtial robots could build it?
You mentioned that you plan to test and brand or license 3rd party parts. Do you think you could have a similar approach for setting up manufacturing sites around the world? Maybe a franchise model for super fast expansion (OSE or Wikispeed becoming the equivalent of the "hamburger university" of McDonnalds).
Are you currently using or planning to use any 3D printable parts?
I remember somebody from wikispeed mentioning in one of your vlog videos that the most expensive part of the car is the engine. Do you have any plans to bring the cost of the engine down somehow? Do you have plans to do an open source engine design?
Most people I know do very bad purchase decisions when it comes to cars. They do not calculate the time value of money, depreciation, inflation, opportinity cost of investment, expenses. Most of these variables could be part of a fool proofed web calculator or mobile app which could show people how much money they'd safe. Just my 2 cents.
You're doing great work!

Honest question, why not? Drugs and free money transfer between countries seems to me to be the most economically viable thing to do with bitcoins in the short-term. If I am not mistaken, money transfer alone might be enough to get the bitcoin economy going. What would be needed is a group of people from a country which sends a lot of remittances abroad to start using such a service. This might at the beginning be hindered if bitcoin itself becomes illegal (which it most likely will become once efficient and secure money transfer becomes a reality) but with the next crisis/bubble hitting, people will take the risk.

I am by no means an economist, but wouldn't a bitcoin-only system (kind of as drawn out by exasperation) essentially create a defacto barrier for investment? What I mean by this is that as long as deflation is 10% nobody will invest in something which does not yield at least 10%&lt;.
Furthermore, would this essentially mean that the higher the deflation the faster general productivity in the economy would grow in order to attract any new investments? Or could this lead to a scenario where pure research without any immediate economic gain would become impossible because either governments could not afford its funding through taxes or through printing money?
I'm just brainstorming here but it seems to me that a predetermined deflationary currency would kill any kind of consumer and financial speculation economy while promoting a highly conservative "investment economy".

TX verification is not the bottleneck in blockchains. The bottlenecks are in the following in order of severity:
* Connection speed of the majority of nodes (ping, not bandwidth). This is pretty much bound by the speed of light. This is especially an issue if the sequencer of the state (in Bitcoin's case the miners) do not have a predetermined order. Bitcoin as a DMMS will always have gospel systems issues.
* State ordering and chaining. You cannot parallalize this by definition. Each state depends on the entirety of the previous states. You can only parallelize things where new produced state does not create interdependence for the other threads. This is not the case in blockchains.
* Execution of state (e.g. smart contracts, or opcodes). This can be considerably sped p but there are hard limits to this too.
This is a technical discussion just like traditional database design parameter choices. A single blockchain can never support all state changes required on earth. Just keep one blockchain per state machine and get a protocol going that in an independently verifiable way can cross check state between dependent state machines.

Maybe something similar to bitmessage could be implemented in which case zerocoins are kept only for a few days.
The real point is going to be that this could be the very first feature improvement of bitcoin or any cryptocurrency. Consideirng that zerocoin might be *the* vital function for drugdealers and illegal activities of all sorts. Any cryptocurrency which adopts this first will have a greater utility value to those people. This means that this the likes of LTC, Namecoin, or any other bitcoin copycat could add this feature and become the new default for silk road.
Now we're in game theory territory. The devs and mining pools absolutely have to implement this or a similar feature very soon to stay ahead of the curve.

That's one step of how we could implement a p2p exchange. Seperate the fiat-storage and verification part via centralized or distributed cryptocurrencies pegged to fiar, and the order matching part which could happen on any exchange. This would bring down the network effects which are currently keeping mtgox alive.

Percent-wise? I don't think so. We've gone from a 1200% volatility (the 2011 crash) to a 50-60% volatility (the recent correction).
With more money flowing in from the rich bastards I can imagine that the miners start holding too. Once that happens we have large demand going long AND supply contracting even further.
The prices right bow are nothing compared to what is possible.
And we haven't gotten to the killer app for Bitcoin yet. Virtual offshore is possible, but paying for DACs is in my opinion going to be the real thing. Wealth won't flow anymore back into fiat that much once the DACs become functional.
@_date: 2013-06-05 19:39:42
More likely than not. That black altcoint would just need an easy way to get the coins and a black market to adopt them, and they would become very fast one of the major cryptocurrencies.
Though it would take a brand new black market and/or exchange to do that. The network effect and the stake in bit coin is pretty damn big for the existing black markets.

The problem lies with the old banking system. There is no way how you could provably show that any cryptographic tocen such as ripples or Open Transactions crypto cash are linked to fiat money in any bank account.
OT could be used by default by banks (if regulations alow that), which would create a perfect bridge between bitcoin and fiat. Once the tokens are issued, they could be used by any exchange anywhere.

It's killing me that people still try to position Bitcoin as a digital currency. It's a digital commodity with Fiat transferability guys...
By positioning it as a currency you put bitcoin at risk to have the same fate as metal backed money, if not worse considering that we know in advance its total availability through mining. It's too easy to manipulate commodity currencies, speculators have decades, if not centuries of experience doing this.
Bitcoin needs to be classified as a **digital commodity** which can be used as a proxy for meta-trade between fiat currencies AND as a LONG investment vehicle.
That would result in bitcoin having a bottom out value due to its use for pure transfer and a growth value due to speculation/investment/savings.

I've signed up to ripple some time ago and read their entire documentation on their wiki.
From a systems theory standpoint they don't seem to understand that there can only be two kinds of currency. Commodity based (gold, silver, BTC), or credit based (fiat). Both have their pros and cons.
Building ripple with commodity based XRP is really not thought through. They could have been credit based and issued by each node. With the current implementation scarcity can arise and hance an independent price of XRP.
I'll be looking at their server code once open sourced and will see whether I can use some of their code base and integrate it with Open Transactions for a new kind of a dual or tripple currency system. Such a system should be BTC based. I have already seen some essays and blogposts of people wigh similar ideas.
BTC in and of itself is insufficient to change the world. It needs a complementary layered system.

Hi fellowtraveler!
I've been readng a lot about OT recently and was wonder how far along you've come. The last time you spoke on Agorist Radio you said that it should not be used in a production environment, has that changed?
Are your progressing as fast as you'd like to? If not, what would you need to speed things up?
I'm just a system theorist with python/R knowledge, but I would love to help out anyway possible.
Every time I think of something bitcoin lacks or services the bitcoin economy desperatly needs I find out OT could do that. Bitcoin should be the glue between OT servers, making a better ripple-like system, true P2P exchanges, etc possible.
Keep up the good work!
@_date: 2013-12-26 14:02:49
Hi fellowtraveler!
I've been keeping an eye on the OT development since the very beginning. I think OT will be the HTTP to Bitcoin's TCP/IP.
The cryptocurrency and crypto application scene is developing at mindboggling speed, so you might not be aware of potentially much better and less patchy solutions to your Namecoin and Bitmessage solutions.
[Invictus Innovations]( is developing their keyhotee identity client based on the DAC (Distributed Autonomous Corporation) blockchain-based solution. It could be a better and more elegant solution than the namecoin+bitmessage one.
Bitshares would also be the best solution for decentralized market making and price discovery between any currencies, or commodities.

@_date: 2013-03-24 22:05:26
Now finding THAT out would be fascinating!
@_date: 2013-12-25 12:47:02
There's a 5th category though. Invictus Inovations is essentially using their protoshares altcoin as a very efficient way to give people a chance to have shares of their future DACs. It's the smartest *probably* legal way for stock disbursement and raising money for a decentralized company I've ever seen. Due to it's inefficiencies by using a POW, I think using the mastercoin idea here (If they ever work out how to make it work) would be the only use case I can think of for mastercoin.
* Namecoin is interesting but flawed (though the first interesting use case just emerged recently).
* Proof of Stake coins are good experimentation grounds simply becuase proof of stake will most likely be an important factor in the future development of DACs.
* Ripple is ridiculous as an altcoin or even a universal payment system BUT it could become the new real-time backbone of a new centralized central banking system for every central bank's jurisdiction. (i.e. validating fiat transactions on a semi-federated transaction ledger every 5-10 seconds).
* Open Transactions (If the company really pushes the project forward) can become the HTTP to Bitcoin's TCPIP.

Borrowing in BTC is pretty crazy considering how deflationary it is. The only reason to do this in my opinion is to short btc on the market if it crashes.
Still, why should the lender trust the borrower? Debt is generally more secure tha  stock in the fiat world because you can get your fiat back from the borrower, if needed through the government. With BTC you don;t have that luxury.

I see myself as a Gesellian (freiwirtschaft), hence I can see bitcoin only as a store of value, not a medium of exchange.
However, your comment really made me think.
Your comment implies that a steady state economy is possible with bitcoin. However, this only holds rrue as long as the bitcoins are sufficiently equally distributed along the total economy. 
Furthermore you imply that the global usage of bitcoin could create a perverse incentive structure for governments and others to engage in warfare. The more of the other's economy you destroy the more your own bitcoins have value. OR the more you destroy the smaller the total economy, hence, bitcoins lose value, pushing value storage back to physicql assets and stock.
Fascinating and a very pre-WW2 type of scenario. 
@_date: 2013-03-12 13:04:15
I am still fascinated that it even worked.
Now we know of some more scenarios how to kill bitcoin. Imagine a deliberate bug commit to bitcoin without anyone noticing. Then getting huge hashing power on that version, and simply not switching once the condition is triggered.
Additionally I can see how one could do some really advanced social engeneering or take over the emails of some of the devs. Shit, one more reason to use bitmessage instead of the mailing lists.
A full scale attack on bitcoin seems much more plausible now.

One can build a distributed/federated exchange ecosystem. That requires the seperation of the order matching entity (the actual exchange) from the fiat "hub" where the money resides. I would imagine the exchanges communicating with one another similarly to how diaspora hubs communicate with one another.
The fiat hubs would do what the Swiss WIR bank does. They should accept fiat and turn it via full reserva banking into cryptographic tokens. Propably via Open Transactions (which will be federated too). At that point the hubs could make money via demurrage (with cryptographic contracts) rather than transaction fees or fractional reserve banking.
The crypto tokens could be traded on all official exchanges signed up at the hub. You might even do it purely via PGP key verification to show that you are a real exchange and not just a ddos kiddy. Bitcoin can then be easily traded for cryptographic tokens. Trading bitcoin other bitcoin copycats is already much easier than trading in fiat.
For legal reasons, just like WIR, the hub might have to limit from which entities it accepts outfoing (cryptotoken to fiat) transactions out of the system. That would be what PGP would be for.
This, or some country changes its banking and central banking software from the old centralized ledger system to a crypto system (without mining), making in-and-out transactions against bitcoin easy as hell. Such a country could become the new crypto-Switzerland.
One can dream.

I don't know about other experimental crypocurrencies, but Protoshares (which isn't really a cryptocurrency) has a 5 minute rate. However, because of the initially very low difficulty, the 2 week readjustment window, and the huge interest from the community, it t resulted in blocks being found every 16-30 seconds.  I personally found 5 blocks, all of which ended up being orphans. Some people in the forums think that about 2/3 of all blocks found were orphans.
If this new proposal was used, combined with a readjustment of the difficulty with every block or so, then we would have a very new kind of cryptocurreny. This and Zerocoin might be the most important developments so far. (I personally think that OP_RETURN will be hugely important to).

This might be where multisig comes in. You have one key on your ring, another via your online bitcoin service. This way you could be, in terms of game theory, safe from ransom or getting kidnaped, but also safe that your online service provider could steal your bitcoins.
Through bitcoin contracts this could even be timed. The contract could state that every X years you need to renew the contract, otherwise it runs out and Y adress gets it send to (in case of death).

I agree. Asteroid mining will be the real deal within 10-20 years.

The news alone that a functioning asteroid mining robot has started to mine should be enough to kill the gold market.
@_date: 2013-03-22 22:25:07
I think that one of the implications for bitcoin is that if 10% of the global population (maybe even less, considering the socio-economic fragmentation of the world) use or have skin in the game (bitcoin) the rest will follow. Given bitcoin's deflationary nature this tipping point is rather easily achievable.
This might mean that effectively until the 10% (or even less) threshold is reached, you are an early adopter and will potentially profit a lot from the herd overrunning the barn.

I agree on the environment part. How do you extrapolate a few hundred years for asteroid mining? The cost of the main parts of doing this is going down exponentially.

Extrapolating a few hundred years for this development seems to me to be less than linear thinking.

I said it before. Any hacker smart enough and with enough resources to sustain an effective DDoS attack against any exchange can make a shitload of bitcoin profit by shorting bitcoin.
From a game theory perspective traders would be stupid *not* to buy DDoS traffic for shorting. In the short term it's a guaranteed profit, in the long term you streangthen the bitcoin ecosystem via smaller failures. Think about it, the bitcoin ecosystem wouldn't be nearly as resilient as it is now without the continuous failures of various services. We would have had an enormeous overshoot a long time ago if it wasn;t for MTGOX's lags.
It's almost a prisoners dilemma for "DDoS shorters". If you don't do it, somebody else will. It will happen inevitably, hence the trust in the centralized exchanges will errode and the way for *any* decentralized exchange will open up more rapidly. In all likelyhood you won't be able to "DDoS short" the decentralized exchanges as easily as the centralized ones, hence you and anybody else DDoS shorting has only a short timeframe in which they can use this technique before we switch to the decentralized alternatives.
tl;dr: prisoners dilemma, smart unscruplous traders must use DDos for shorting, makes the entire bitcoin ecosystem stronger. Use it as long as you can.

I know about Freicoin. The guys who created it have no idea how Freigeld (demurrage currencies) work.
Freicoin is a commodity-like money, similar to bitcoin, but with built-in demurrage. Freigeld must be a credit-currency backup up to a significant percentage by commodity money such as gold or bitcoin.
You need both, a money for storage and base money between economic hubs such as banks/governments/companies which serve for hoarding, *and* a credit currency backed up by the base money (preferably via cryptographic contracts) which serves as the "bad money" in Gresham's law.
The bad money is a bad store of value, but incentivesez economic turnover. The good money is a good store of value but is really bad a arbitratig trade.
Freicoin makes no sense whatsoever. Thanks for pointing it out though.

Great point. I'd like to add that Bitcoin vs Fiat also has a Good vs Bad Money dynamic, meaning that the bad money (fiat) drives out of the market the good money (bitcoin) in terms of daily usage because the bad money wants to change hands faster. Inversly, the good money has a higher value because it is traded at a premium due to the bad nature of the bad money.
The real question in my opinion is what will happen once somebody builds an alternative currency which acts as the "bad" money, but is backup up by bitcoin? An inflationary currency backed up by bitcoin seems not to fit any model (that would need credit expansion including fractional reserve banking). 
However, *demurrage* crypto currencies which can be linked via cryptographic contracts to a single bitcoin (meaning, making double spending impossible) might be a very good approximation of bad money. Open Transactions might be the real deal here. Linking it to bitcoin would also increase bitcoin's value proportionally to the bad credit currencie's velocity of circulation within the greater economy.

Wow. That's fascinating!
That would mean that bitcoin can have all the upsides of old money while avoiding any downsides.
True anonymity might be the breakout point for bitcoin.

Kosovo. We use euro. SEPA doesn't work (70+ euro fees on every transaction). Western Union outgoing is 50+ euro at least. Moneygram can't be trusted. Paypal has blacklisted us.
I'd love to buy every month 50-100 euro bitcoins, but there is no reasonable way to get at them.
If you can figure out how I can buy bitcoins efficiently and securely I'l gladly buy from you next month and for the coming months.

The way I see it this actually increases the security of the blickchain within the same 6 confirmation time window. An attacker would need to outpace even the orphaned blocks.
Further, this might just make pools obsolete because total variance between payouts is probabilistically smalle enough to not bother with joining a pool. It would decentralize bitcoin completely again.

Fascinating. Do you happen to know any good reads or online courses which goes along the lines of your analysis?
I'd love to be able to make such an analysis.

The best bitcoin related research papers came out of the Microsoft research labs. I don't think though that their management has a clue what they are doing.

We need federated P2P exchanges REALLY bad. Open Transactions is in my opinion our best bet for that.

I appreciate your thoughtful reply. Non-Austians have a hard time on this sub.
Your conclusion that bitcoin is only good as a medium of exchange is currently valid and will very likely be valid for some time to come. Several empirical studies have been conducted in the past on the matter of price volatility of finite or rare products such as land and precious metals. Bitcoin is no different, it might even be more volatile because, unlike real gold and land, it can be bought and traded on the global market.
My point that bitcoin is a good store of value but not a good mediu of exchange is based on the incentives deflationary vs inflationary moneys/currencies have. A healthy economy can only exist wit the constant regeneration of goods and services. We know that deflationary money doesn't work because we have very good data points from the past (especially the 1930s). And no, it was the Austrian central bank which had all its members from the austrian school of economics which might have been hit the most severe. The infinite devisibility of bitcoin should not play too much of a role here.
Any money that is put out of circulation is taken out of the productive economy, the economy that employs people. People get their purchasing power in this circulation, not from hoarding. We know what the viscious cycle looks from this point on.
Keynes is a Gesellian, he even points that out in his writings. The problem with Gesell;s solution to hording without destroing the underlying monetary base via inflation was *demurrage*.
I must point this out. We know from empirical data that demurrage does not have the same inflationary effect as the expansion of the monetary supply via printing fiat. Demurrage does not change the NPV calculations of companies, hence there is no need for general price increases. It has in fact often a deflationary effect on perishable goods (food, etc) because they are consumed faster and without booms or busts.
Keynes pointed out in his writings that demurrage is impractical because at the time it was done manually via stamps on banknotes. His more automated solution for the controle of the monetary base of the currency via the central bank in boom and bust cycles.
WIth today's technology we can implement Gesell's framework. Use bitcoin as the underlying deflationary money which can easily be used as base money betwwen banks/hubs/individuals (kind of like ripple). Add a secondary layer of "credit coins" (or whatever) above it with cryptographic contracts which have demurrage built into them... and you've got yourself a dual currency system without the need for banks or middlemen.
You wouldn't run into the problems the gold standard has, neither into the once the current FX market has, and middlemen would be obsolete. You'd get rid of most inflation too.

So, the Chinese government is actively manipulating the CNY/USD/EURO currency market.
In what scenario could the manipulate the CNY/BTC market? Any ideas?
