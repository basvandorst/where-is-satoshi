any kind of financial crisis you would see the banks close. good luck getting your money out then. also, these bitcoin exchanges are not banks, they are meant to trade. The number one rule of bitcoin is if you do *not* control the keys, they aren't your bitcoin.

ask them for the "Standard transaction id" -- i don't know who this is you're dealing with but its possible they just have a batch script that runs every few hours to process all pending transactions in their system.

@_date: 2016-06-08 06:53:46
You know that will only happen if there is total and complete economic meltdown -- which basically means you will have no internet.

@_date: 2016-06-13 10:04:20
I just downloaded the history for that address (sent) and don't see your amount. 0.10248902
Its possible the exchange hasn't posted it yet...what exchange is this from or who is sending it?
I've seen it take up to an hour for an exchange to even see a deposit.
@_date: 2016-06-13 09:14:14
i know. it was a joke?
@_date: 2016-06-08 07:24:48
@_date: 2016-06-13 08:24:48
it'll drop by 50% in the course easily. Especially if something triggers a panic.
@_date: 2016-06-25 19:59:26
What happens if the address was already expired and someone sends to it?
@_date: 2016-06-12 16:40:49
because you don't control the keys. if you don't control the keys its not your bitcoin.

You can download (torrent) a starter blockchain -- I had to do this because I had some on a very old mac with bitcoin core client. It still took a day or two to complete the rest of the transactions. I recommend using jaxx.io or electrum.

@_date: 2017-01-19 08:09:45
you may have also triggered a suspicious transaction flag on the exchange. Typically those are processed  manually. Some exchanges to all transactions nightly so wait at least 24 hours.

check the transaction number on the blockchain explorer.
if its not there it probably didn't go through. just send it again. also make sure you send .50 cents first before sending large transactions.

I don't know what i believe.

@_date: 2016-12-07 07:55:39
Why? who else shutdown?
@_date: 2016-11-24 22:38:02
jaxx.io is the best wallet and easiest to use that I've seen so far. Works on multiple platforms, extensions and mobile. and you can always restore your wallet as long as you have the seedphrase. Its also a light wallet so you don't have to store the blockchain locally.
@_date: 2016-12-02 05:38:10
but how do you choose? you don't know if you made it high enough ahead of time. jaxx has a low, medium, high fee which i believe is auto-calculated. other wallets let you set a fee.
@_date: 2016-12-24 02:08:38
I did.
@_date: 2016-12-25 08:54:54
isn't that their business model though? i assume everyone does this.

@_date: 2016-12-02 05:46:17
yeah i hear you. i think there should be some of smart calculation for suggested fee and if you want to double it it should let you -- but i had one transaction fail on me because i didn't send a large enough fee. i had no idea what it should have been.
@_date: 2016-11-25 21:51:43
oh ok. if you say so.
@_date: 2016-12-17 07:43:05
I like jaxx.io as a secondary wallet and electrum as my main wallet.
both have bip39 seed phrases that are the only thing you need to backup. Jaxx is nice because it has a chrome addon, desktop and mobile app. I can access my wallet on a diff. computer via the extension.

I don't know if it uses the standard bip39 passphrase but if it does I believe you can just load that passphrase into any light wallet like jaxx or electrum and it will have your coins. I'm not sure though as I've never used Armory.

My accountant was into bitcoin surprisingly, new quite a bit. He and his son were day trading it. He said, well just keep a ledger of  your ins and outs incase anybody comes asking for it one day. I liked him, he was like "fuck it, what they don't know won't hurt 'em" -- but then he disappeared.

@_date: 2016-11-26 04:29:41
oh right. i fucked up my math. 10% not bad for one trade. Did you use any automated tools? How do you find out which exchange to arbitrate? 
@_date: 2016-11-27 21:02:33
haha -- in my research I didn't get that far. the only sites that talked about bitcoin were fake news sites.
@_date: 2016-12-21 05:43:38


so is it *only* on android? no web interface? that's pretty fucking lame if so
@_date: 2016-12-25 09:28:45

@_date: 2016-12-25 09:16:07
Dude fuck off. This is like the 10th post today. If you knew how to do it you wouldn't be writing about it on some shitty blog.
@_date: 2016-12-01 08:32:08
i've switched wallets a few times over the years. don't know how deep they go if they are tracking beyond one transfer or not. how sophisticated are these blockchain analysis tools?
@_date: 2016-11-28 00:22:36
oh. never heard slag before.
@_date: 2016-12-28 05:38:52
Try electrum or jaxx. Jaxx has a "high med low" fee dialog.
@_date: 2016-12-02 05:29:55
i don't want to have to determine what the fee is for each transaction. how the fuck am i supposed to know what fee will work and which is too low?
@_date: 2016-11-27 00:34:13
Not there yet, but pushing 50. If I were you i'd setup auto purchase on coinbase.com (if you're in US) and buy $20/week.
@_date: 2016-12-13 05:36:02
What do you recommend? the only reason I use them is because they show prices in USD at click of a button.
@_date: 2016-12-29 05:33:10
That's every sub on every big event that involves that sub.
Of course people get excited and post memes. The problem in 2013 is we only had 1 or 2 exchanges something like 90% of the trading was on mtgox and it went down.
This time around we have dozens of exchanges in the US alone.
@_date: 2016-12-24 08:10:50
Yes. anything that requires you to identify yourself is going to be subpoenaed by the IRS.
@_date: 2016-12-31 00:58:08
Tell them to not cave to the IRS illegal actions.
@_date: 2016-11-25 09:36:01
did bitcoin die?
@_date: 2016-11-25 09:46:24
and what exactly is it i have to backup? what if the company goes out of business? 
@_date: 2016-12-25 09:30:08
Uh, i hope you didn't need that for retirement because this shit could very well be worthless in a year or two.
@_date: 2016-11-27 00:39:50
Yeah. That's definitely a concern. But if you're holding then its not really an issue.
@_date: 2016-12-21 06:26:48
I only see mobile apps on their site. I do not see a desktop version for Mac.

@_date: 2016-12-02 05:28:06
i think its for a lot of reasons....tax is the legal cover. they just want the data to mine it.

I'm concerned that the IRS is now requesting data for all their users from 2013 to now.

@_date: 2016-12-23 06:20:09
is 100+ transactions great? I don't really know. I see these different colored dots next to profiles but no indication as to what they mean.
There's another guy who has 3K+ transactions but he's further away.

i don't see a chart just a marketing page
@_date: 2016-12-01 06:53:09
i think you're right. i guess i have to export my coinbase history somehow to do some analysis.
@_date: 2016-12-27 21:31:46
Get out now. Coinbase is about to go down.
@_date: 2016-12-25 03:07:11
If he was pissed at $18 imagine how pissed he is now at $888.
@_date: 2016-12-24 08:10:15
yeah, they are getting experts instead of some regular "researching" bitcorn.
@_date: 2016-12-21 05:49:28
bitcoin is not a stock....and yes there are tons of forums where people spew that shit. been a few years since i went on one though
@_date: 2016-11-29 03:27:28
you don't get it.
if you want to exchange in and out of fiat you *have* to use the exchange. but do NOT use it as a bitcoin wallet. Just withdraw btc to your own wallet. then yo can do whatever the hell you want with it.
@_date: 2016-11-28 00:50:37
70k ain't much of a ransom. False flag to get public behind Rule 41.

@_date: 2016-12-12 04:55:08


is it bip39 though? that's my main concern incase mycelium shuts down.
@_date: 2016-12-07 05:20:00
wtf? lol.
@_date: 2016-12-12 02:46:32
no people were saying that 3 years ago.
@_date: 2016-12-12 04:20:34
Don't leave your bitcoin on coinbase or mycelium.
@_date: 2016-11-29 03:16:35
Every transaction in the blockchain can be traced. Of course they will do that, they are legally required to by the KYC/AML laws.
Its no different than a bank really.
@_date: 2017-01-03 04:52:28
Indeed, and then coke made commercials with him: 
@_date: 2017-01-05 05:49:30
Isn't $1234 the ATH?
@_date: 2016-12-23 07:35:02
Oh don't worry. it will be outlawed soon. IRS is already coming after the coinbase users....more to come. I wouldn't be surprised if the US just flat out makes it illegal in 2017. Its not like the sideshow-bob-elect and his swamp-dweller appointees are going to be friendly to it...and you still can't spend this shit anywhere you want with some sort of gymnastics and/or money laundering.
@_date: 2016-12-31 00:48:57
and typos like this ^
@_date: 2016-12-25 09:55:59
well of course its traders trading. does anyone actually dispute that?? half the world is on vacation for 1-2 weeks.
@_date: 2016-11-26 04:38:17
ahh i see. are there any two exchanges that typically are consistently arbitragable?
@_date: 2016-12-23 07:40:42
seriously? the old wallets no longer work?
@_date: 2016-12-25 09:54:21
To keep competitors out. The KYC/AML laws cost around $15-20 million to comply in all 50 states. So if you want to start a bank or any type of financial instrument, you need some serious cash upfront before you even begin.
@_date: 2016-11-27 07:39:47

so you can avoid taxes by just replacing your btc when spend it which is what i do.
@_date: 2016-11-28 04:03:48
haha -- hey i'll consider anything at first
@_date: 2016-12-01 08:20:02
so how is the IRS going to know then?
@_date: 2016-12-29 03:10:52
not gonna happen. the "institution" has no interest in Bitcoin....it has interest in "blockchain" which will be some other bastardized thing.
@_date: 2016-11-29 03:23:54
sure it can be traced but its more difficult to prove it was you who was doing the gambling. Anyway, with an exchange you don't control the keys, so its not your bitcoin. Always transfer to your personal wallet and you're fine.
@_date: 2017-01-07 03:25:59
nothing for free bro. I think 3-5% markup is pretty standard these days.
@_date: 2016-12-27 21:03:56
higher than when it was $1200+?

@_date: 2016-12-01 08:21:33
Yes, its called a blackmarket and is nothing new...bitcoin will stay there until IRS gets their shit together. Nobody will use bitcoin if they are going to be tracked and have to pay taxes on every transaction as capital gains. They won't use it either if transactions don't confirm either.
Even though people are tired of the government, etc. they still think voting will change something...and most people are not going to knowingly break the law to bring about change.

If you're upset it lost $40 bucks you are too heavily invested in it.
@_date: 2016-12-29 05:27:25
depends on where you live. and yes you can. but you'll need a government issued ID and a bank account on any US exchange.
You can try localbitcoins.com but you should have an adult go with you -- you don't really know who you're dealing with in person -- a lot of criminals use bitcoin.
My advice is to get to your local bitcoin meetup and ask someone there if they want to trade. The one I go to everyone is very friendly and helpful and its a safer environment. I'm sure some guys are even carrying.

I'm not sure about mycelium....if you don't control the keys and you can't restore your wallet in any bip39 wallet then don't use it. 
jaxx.io is decent but new (buggy). I also like electrum. Both are light wallets and use seed phrases so you can restore it in any bip39 wallet -- incase they go under.

@_date: 2016-10-25 07:59:54
pretty much. i didn't vote for him but i'm somewhat curious what will happen if he does win.
@_date: 2016-10-26 12:45:18
so is it over? should we evacuate?
@_date: 2016-10-16 08:43:44
transfer the btc out of circle first to your own wallet otherwise your account will get flagged. 
@_date: 2016-10-29 07:24:26
nice remix
@_date: 2016-10-29 06:15:23
at 1500
@_date: 2016-10-29 10:47:22
There is no opposite. That's how it works for some people.
@_date: 2016-10-30 04:51:58
1224 to be exactly. Droped $2k USD on that bitch.
@_date: 2016-10-26 15:22:42
blockchain is fucked right now -- if its been 12-24 hours then start to worry. i have 2 transactions that simply disappeared from wallets after restarting because they have not confirmed yet.
@_date: 2016-10-28 09:47:23
IDK BUT IT'S FUNNY HOW THIS TYPO IS THE ONLY STORY HERE.
@_date: 2016-10-11 09:02:37
Looks pretty fake there buddy.
@_date: 2016-10-27 05:59:55
.....aaaaaand that's why i use Sync.com instead of Dropbox. 
@_date: 2016-10-28 06:29:19
If this election has proven anything its that I should keep more of my money in BTC.
@_date: 2016-10-29 06:19:08
i won't be above water until 1200. we are more than halfway there. woohoo!
@_date: 2016-10-26 16:12:53
yeah. two of mine are simply gone.
@_date: 2015-11-04 04:39:28
@_date: 2015-11-03 07:11:09
Yeah. I have always faked info. I don't care what the rules are I don't want someone having my personal info via whois.
@_date: 2016-10-28 07:56:55
backwards it spells twiges
@_date: 2016-10-26 16:39:54
the transactions don't appear in the transaction list after restarting the wallet. I don't know what to make of it. One wallet the bits arrived, the other is still empty.
@_date: 2016-10-29 06:18:41
haha. the dedication it takes to produce this video. 
@_date: 2016-10-28 07:01:36
namesilo is even better. free privacy for life and cheaper prices....and they take bitcoin too.
@_date: 2016-10-29 06:15:00
When he buys it goes down. When he sells it goes up.
Same thing happens everytime to me on the stock market.
@_date: 2016-10-29 07:34:12
Take 10k and start a business. Put the rest in savings.
@_date: 2016-10-28 07:39:05
best there is.
@_date: 2016-10-11 08:58:14
That country will totally let me grab them by the Gina.
@_date: 2016-05-30 07:27:48
Electrum is what I use. Probably not the most secure. But its easy to use and easy to recover, just be sure to backup your seed phrase and keep the software up to date.
@_date: 2016-05-14 06:19:16
I don't know why you would post this if true.
@_date: 2016-07-06 15:05:14
its not free. they charge transaction fees.
@_date: 2016-07-09 06:02:59
@_date: 2016-07-03 08:34:11
that hardware needs to be replaced every few months so no, i don't expect them to last long if its not profitable.
@_date: 2016-07-03 02:47:49
oh i know. i got in at $4
@_date: 2016-07-03 04:31:11
Not sure I don't really pay much attention to the price. Its an automated buy. Every monday and weds.
@_date: 2016-07-03 03:51:26
oh. i don't even know. i thought 10 bitcoins owned was 2-digit club.
@_date: 2016-07-03 03:14:32
2 digit club.
@_date: 2016-07-03 02:40:44
IT JUST TANKED $20. SELL!
@_date: 2016-07-03 00:23:10
704 bust.
@_date: 2016-07-13 07:52:27
Why? What happened to blockchain.info?
@_date: 2016-07-03 08:01:56
Their equipment only lasts about 6 months or less now. So they will just throw it away. It can't be used for anything other than recycling.
@_date: 2016-07-17 06:58:38
okie dokie
@_date: 2016-07-03 03:19:59
40/week for 2 years now
@_date: 2016-07-16 04:44:48
I don't know. but I always transfer to my own wallet before spending. I know they are at least tracking where money out and in is coming from. but its certainly possible to go deeper, that's kind of the point of blockchain technology.
@_date: 2016-07-03 02:51:21
if it stays double...sure, maybe some stay.
@_date: 2016-07-09 07:25:25
Why you little...
@_date: 2016-07-03 05:49:43
no. $40/week. I buy $20 on monday and $20 on weds.
@_date: 2016-07-09 07:17:40
I was just recalling all that shit -- the giant starbucks cup outside the office. That shit was hilarious.
@_date: 2016-07-13 09:09:37
Yes. yes. and no.
@_date: 2016-07-03 05:04:54
as soon as its not profitable they will stop.
@_date: 2016-07-16 04:40:33
This is nothing new. We've known that for awhile now. But thanks for posting it happened again.
@_date: 2016-07-13 07:11:37
...this one time...in band camp...
@_date: 2016-07-03 02:18:00
Miners will leave.
@_date: 2016-07-03 08:02:27


How could you possibly know what each and every miner's operating costs are??
@_date: 2016-07-03 02:04:26
Depends on the country.
@_date: 2016-07-13 07:56:25
they should have emailed you the original private key when you created the wallet.
@_date: 2016-07-03 00:34:42
Depends on the country.
@_date: 2016-07-03 03:17:44
I've never sold. I now just buy once a week no matter the price.
@_date: 2016-07-01 03:00:40
which bank?
@_date: 2016-07-12 07:05:08
160k is shit for NYC -- especially for a director level.
