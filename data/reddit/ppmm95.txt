@_date: 2018-08-23 12:04:58
and the use the electricity to mine more bitcoin faster. Thats why the price has been falling, fucking goblins increased the supply.
@_date: 2018-08-17 11:52:33
Solid points. 
Still worried since bitcoin has such a small percentage of the worlds economy at this moment. And its power consumption is already this high.
Well see how the future plays out. I'll just keep a portion in btc anyways.
@_date: 2018-08-28 09:26:21
Good stuff, I didnt see that coming. No worries.
@_date: 2018-08-27 18:23:34
This says enough about your knowledge of pos.
Btw what ur talking about is exactly what btc is lately. 5 coorporations have 50 to 60% of the network.
@_date: 2018-08-17 10:59:33
Not like printing money but yes it is a complete waste of energy. 70 twh a year last time i checked. Thats around the power consumption a small country consumes. There are much better options as a currency. 
Imo 70 twh a year to solve a soduko is bullshit.
 
Edit: im gonna get downvoted to hell again 
@_date: 2018-08-17 13:53:47
Fiat currenctly still counts for 99% of the money. Theres quite a gap between fiat and bitcoin. So the comparison in not fair imo. 
Lets switch them around, bitcoin counts for 99% how much energy will it need?

Can you stop talking shit? Apperantly you dont know anything about nav. I am staking nav. Anyone can stake nav, people are getting rewards while staking 1 NAV a 0.25 euro.
Im not talking about masternodes, validators all that kind of bullshit. I am talking about NAV, i know it works because i am staking NAV at 4% a year. (Its actually more than 4%, 4% is the minimum.)
Sometimes 10% a month, sometimes nothing but in the end always around 4% a year.
Dont talk about stuff you clearly didnt research. 
Edit: stop bringing up Ethereum, vitalik blabla. NAV has nothing to do with that.
@_date: 2018-08-28 05:31:55
There are multiple ways to secure a pos network. There are much better and faster solutions out there.
Edit: can someone poor get some btc through mining?
At least with PoS (NAVs version), no Dpos or whatever that bullshit is called, anyone can stake. Anyone can claim 4-5% a year. 
@_date: 2019-03-29 21:35:58

Litebit.eu offers fiat (euro) gateways aswell. Im dutch and every time i cashed out the money was in my bankaccount the next day.
@_date: 2018-10-17 09:08:53
Whos retarded now, everything i said is correct. 
Microsoft is a company
They sell Windows, their product.
the operating system Windows (as you like to be fancy about it.) Is worth what its worth in store. Because there is a company behind it, that wants to make money. And people are okay paying their price.
The program Windows on it self has no value, just like btc. Its worth what we are willing to pay. December that was 20k now 6k. Sentiment is shifting again, if people decide 5k is the new bottom, geuss what will happen? It drops to 5k. 
Its all due to market sentiment, speculation.
I think you have to be careful calling other retarded when you are having a hard time understanding. "Speculation" 
@_date: 2018-10-16 14:58:36
I will do my best to call it whatever everyone decides to call it. 
Application, implementation, protocol. 
Honestly i dont really care, that probably has something to do with me not being a native. But ill try okay :)
Anyways thanks for the effort, and the links.

Btc fanboy shill
@_date: 2018-10-16 13:53:31
Litecoin for real? Its nothing more than a sad bitcoin clone that brings nothing new. 
If btc would work its fine we have btc. If btc wont work... damn ltc wont work aswell. 
Only reason for ltc to increase in price is cuz new people log in on coinbase. See btc at say 6k and think to themselves damn thats expensive i wont have a full btc now. 
BUT I can buy a few ltc coins for the same amount invested and start dreaming about ltc reaching 10k 20k or whatever dumb number they hang on it. 
LTC days are over, just move on already.
@_date: 2018-10-25 07:57:42
The more people know bitcoin the more will start mining. It is correlated whether you like it or not.
@_date: 2018-10-16 14:04:46
So it uses Tor, union routing. Like Verge lol? 
@_date: 2018-10-16 19:49:30
Lol this guy. If that is true, youre incredibly stupid
@_date: 2018-10-16 14:32:15
Youre dense, it is an application. It is created to suit bitcoin at this moment, but it can be built on top of any blockchain. So yes.
LN privacy relies on a network (union/tor) that has been proven to not work. Why even mention such a 'privacy' option.
I get you love bitcoin and probably invested a bit to much. But dont act like everything is going perfect. Bitcoin has some serious problems which hopefully LN can fix someday.
@_date: 2018-10-17 08:13:39
Ur a moron. Please understand that. 
Anyone can see right through you
@_date: 2018-10-24 18:02:56
Good point and it already uses 70 twh a year.
@_date: 2018-10-16 14:49:16
So youre just falling over the word 'application' to get the feeling you are some how on the right side.


They apply LN to the BTC network.
So its an application, with many applications. I got it from the start. 
Thanks for the link tho pretty usefull.
@_date: 2018-10-16 15:33:27
Nice! That thing is glued to the road. Enjoy it, good to see there are Americans with taste :) 
@_date: 2018-10-16 14:06:20
LN already provides that. Almost instant basically feeless transactions. If LN works bitcoin is perfect.( except POW.) If it doesnt its back to the drawing table. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 13:46:37
That not something i need. Thats something people say to ignore that btc has failed. What does digital scarcity even mean. Satoshi and others, decided! btc hard cap is 21 million, and now everyone is yelling Digital gold! Digital gold!
Digital scarcity means nothing imo.
What i need is a system that lets me send Funds from a to b. Private ! To anyone in the world. With low costs and preferably hella fast. Bitcoin can NOT do this, sadly enough. 
Blockchain can do amazing things for artist, journalist etc. It would give them a way to operate without being 'slaved' by record labels or media stations. 
@_date: 2018-10-17 11:59:49
Lol rage, well done old guy 
@_date: 2018-10-16 17:42:50

Tor/onion cant be considered private

To make it easier for you.
Case 1
- LN works BTC works LTC works.
Everything works thus there is no need for LTC. It has nothing to offer except 'being an alternative'
Case 2
- LN sucks BTC sucks LTC sucks
Everything sucks thus there is no need for BOTH BTC and LTC. 
 
@_date: 2018-10-17 08:38:39
Microsoft Windows is a company that sells something, completely different story than bitcoin.
Bitcoin are purely bought to speculate. Hoping to see the value rise. I understand enough to see that btc at this moment is nothing more than a gambling asset. 
@_date: 2018-10-17 09:30:55


This is your problem btw. Assigning 'true value' to an asset that is being heavily manipulated. Only goes up or down when the market sentiment shifts. Speculation again, why dont you look it up.
@_date: 2018-10-16 14:23:00
Well, i got nothing against that. That seems true. 
Then again it brings nothing new to the table. I could understand it if a coin like Myriad (5 algos) would be at ltcs spot. Its PoW but entirely different from other PoW networks.
It just makes no sense that ltc is even around imo.
@_date: 2018-10-16 16:09:28
Pedigree Nice.
Trusted? Didnt the dev sell thousands of coins at market ATH? 
@_date: 2018-10-17 08:16:40
You wont understand what i am trying to say.
You act like btc is a holy grail, a digital gold.
I disagree with that since its only a number created by satoshi and others.
Unlike physical gold, which is a complete difference and actually is worth something.
Scarcity, effort to mine etc.
Btc is nothing more than a few numbers being put together 9 years ago. Bitcoin is something digital in a physical world. 
@_date: 2018-10-17 08:13:03
This sub is so easily burned ffs.
I understand that.
Everyone here acts like btc is fine like LN is fine. 
Bitcoin is even private now!
Open your eyes its not even close to being finished.
@_date: 2018-10-16 14:13:25
its just a number in a digital world. 21 mil hard cap was simply 'created'. There can not be specific value to that. Not like gold at least, there must be a difference between physical value and 'digital' value.
We need a currency that works, seeing the improvements btc has with LN looks good, but its still far from finished. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 19:20:57


Thats a really good point of view. Miners, stakers need to secure the network otherwise there would be no network. If they dont get rewarded they wouldnt do it. So you need a system that rewards them.
This seems fair i geuss. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 14:54:48
Thats just plain dumb imo. So calling it an implentation/protocol is fine, calling it an application is not. (like many articles do.)

You do know bitcoin runs on a blockchain right? 
So your comment literally makes no sense.

Dont act like LN works fine. Tor/onion cant be considered private lol
@_date: 2018-10-16 14:15:30
Is this even a serious question. 
What do you think i would mean with private? In a electronic context, blegh.
@_date: 2018-10-16 14:20:36
LN is only an application, it can be build on top of any blockchain. LN privacy is heavily being debated tho. 10 mins Google tells enough. Onion routing has big downsides, tor has major downsides. Its not bullet proof at all.
So again i wouldnt be so sure about what ur saying. 
@_date: 2018-10-12 11:44:06

I try but bitcoin is confusing AF.
  


I was talking about union/tor.

I do try to be open minded, i cant help but having these questions about btc especially when being triggered by waiting an hour which might be partially the exchanges fault but still. It just sucks and something needs to be done before the next histeria cycle.
Thanks for taking the time to explain some things.
@_date: 2019-06-11 13:23:04


I did, maybe it was unclear since im no native but i literally said it needs 2 confirmations i got one. Also fee is fixed at 0.0005 btc which is a pretty fair fee to use btc. But what youre saying is binance might take 0.0004 for themselves and only use 0.0001 for the tx if theyd do that it would show on the blockexplorer


This is usefull, thanks ill take my time to read it.


So if btc is designed the way it is, and probably wont change. Why is it usefull if its so damn slow?
I get the store of value which actually sounds a bit sad.
Like yall know its fucked up, and wont be a decent means of transfer so quickly came up with something new because it would otherwise be completely useless.
@_date: 2019-06-11 13:17:40
Greed and fomo, everything seem to be working fine for them now. They get a paycheck every month and can go shopping and pay bills with relative ease. They simply do not care about it at this moment.
Once everything moons again the will feel left out, and hope they can make a bunch of money of it. This only happens when major media report stuff like btc 80k. Up xxxx% this year. They buy in, get burned with the inevitable crash and most likely sell. The ones that stick around start caring about fundamentals or have great dreams and will be  waiting for the next move. 
Circle repeats.
@_date: 2019-06-11 12:37:49
Nope its dumb to talk about something you only know half the story of.
The exchange Binance in this case needs 2 confirmations, it got one after +- 20 minutes. The next should follow within 10. Yet it took btc 30 more minutes to confirm my TX the second time. This thing is as slow as it can be.
Complete duration was around 1 hour before it arrived. Exchange did everything it needs to do within the first 10 min. Btc took 40-50.
@_date: 2019-06-11 19:07:04
Yeah well i dont see that happening anytime soon
@_date: 2019-06-11 13:09:46
What youre saying makes no sense. fees are told beforehand i knew the fee was 0.0005 btc i never complained about that. 
Why it doesnt make sense is my first confirmation took 20 mins, i get that Exchange needs to arrange my TX and i need to wait for the next block +- 10mins. But why did it take 30-40 mins to get my second confirmation? This has nothing to do with the exchange since i already had a confirmation and the second one shouldve taken another +- 10 mins. Total +- 30 mins. It took twice that time eventually.
@_date: 2019-06-20 08:16:54
i knew it was bad but seeing those number run higher and higher seems unrealistic eventho it isnt
@_date: 2019-06-11 12:29:56
Ai, your analogies actually point in favor of what i am saying. 
Internet wasnt usefull for the masses at all untill a proper browser arrived. That browser couldve upgraded, yet it got overthrown by Chrome firefox etc.
There were a lot of tech companies working with PCs before Windows. Windows was simply the first to bring it to the masses. Btc is the first, something else will most likely bring it to the masses in the next 10 yrs or so.
 


No, but the stopped using horses pretty fast, now they are only recreational. See btc as the horse here, that also was here first and it got overthrown by the cars because they were improvements. There were many trying to build cars at that time, only the model T succeeded at first and was also overthrown by better more advanced vehicles.


I dont care where you work, that doesnt give you a crystal orb to be sure about btc future. Bitcoin will be replaced or it must be improved. Dont act like you know it all because you simply dont Mr IT guy.
@_date: 2019-06-11 11:47:30
I got a bit triggered because i didnt expect it to take this long. Sorry for that. 
Binance uses 2 confirmations, it was completed roughly an hour later.
@_date: 2019-06-11 10:55:48
I send a small amount of bitcoin from an exchange to another. I send it at 1206 its now 1254 and its still waiting for a second confirmation. I thought blocktimes were 10 mins? 
Also how do yall expect this to be the future of finance when it takes an hour to send and recieve.
E: Funny how this sub is full of hopes and dreams whenever someone kicks against it a bit the drama comes out.
@_date: 2019-06-11 11:53:16
I never said such things, these discussion have been played out multiple times. Security, fees, speed, decentralization etcetc.
History has shown us that the one who is first(btc) will most likely be overtaken by something thats better. Btc had its first decade and still it cant seem to get it right. 
Its simply annoying to wait a hour for the transaction to go through, if btc doesnt fix its shit soon alternatives will take over.
Btw youre completely brainwashed
@_date: 2019-04-26 17:12:15
It has nothing to do with socialism, yet more to do with decentralization. The way bitcoin is shaped in my view, ensures in the end the wealthy will have most power over the network. 
When does something stop being decentralizated?
A handfull of people owning the majority of coins, is something still decentralizated when the network can possibly be controlled by, lets say 100 people? Because that would mean id have to trust my bitcoin in their hands.
People who dont see the issues a deflationary network could bring are a bit deluded imo. 
If deflation leads to more centralization?
@_date: 2019-04-26 17:29:05
@_date: 2019-06-11 14:58:44
If this is real well see an even insaner one in 
- 2021 1000000 
- 2023 10000000
- 2025 100000000
- 2027 1000000000
It makes no sense
@_date: 2019-04-26 13:05:25
Can anyone explain why we consider deflationary as a positive thing? 
I cant really make sense of it, the longer the network survives the lower the amount of 'new' btc is. So far sounds good. Thus probably raising usd price.
But doesnt this mean that bitcoin will create more wealth for the wealthy eventually? They will be the only ones that can mine btc in the near future, and we can see this happening today. Mining with a simple CPU hasnt been possible for already 2 years or so.
What happens when block rewards become so small, it cant be halved anymore? Wouldnt a disinflationary system be much more benefical as a store of value, currency or whatsoever?
@_date: 2019-04-26 20:09:11
I pretty much agree with everything youve said.
But there is another alternative to inflationary which is disinflationary.
I think a disinflationary system could be more benificial to miners and users than a deflationary system that can possibly break itself down. Talking 2140 here.
@_date: 2019-06-11 12:43:16
Its not a legit TX untill its confirmed, you cant do anything with it before that.
@_date: 2019-04-05 02:30:56
Because of the amount of bullish news/posts lately, and my own noob sentiment i now believe this is probably the denial phase.
Bottem inbound.
@_date: 2019-04-26 19:01:22
This makes sense, thanks for taking the time.
@_date: 2019-04-26 17:28:09


Sure, sounds legit. Same goes for a disinflationary system i think, although youll be inflating each year a x%. Youll always inflate less than the year before. Making a solid foundation whilst keeping the miners attracted by giving them rewards instead of only the transaction cost.


I hope so, still worried the bitcoin dry up means the average person couldnt make enough to keep going. Last crash many small miners had to quit or start using a pool. The big corporations are doing fine, whilst making money of of it.
I dont know if im right, just worried about the possibility to lose decentralization because we have chosen a deflationary system, instead of a disinflationary one.
Youve cleared some thing up, thanks.
Eventhough its all speculating im honestly not trying to fud, just some thoughts.
@_date: 2018-11-23 12:04:04


They bought it for other reasons, gaming or whatsoever, and where smart enough to mine btc when it the hashrate was still low. Obviously its now harder but its not impossible. You will just get less btc, but value wise youll get the same amount of $ for mining. Probably even more. 
The points about equipment is a bit unfair on itself, then i can also start about electricity costs a bank has. Dont forget to mention al the PCs and other equipment they bought.
Oh and the bonuses topbankers get at 3 million a year or so ? Believe this was the case with a bank in germany that almost went bankrupt a year before.
What about the inflation we have ? What about the increasing debt because of printing FIAT? What about American IOU's? 
BTCs idea is infinitly superior to the traditional systems we have right now, using the network only costs a few cents across the world. And it doesnt HAVE to cost you a cent to get btc. 
Just to not become to much of a btc fanboy i think PoW is fundamentally flawed. Energy usage, more centralization by the day. 
PoS, DAGs or maybe some new crypto will bring us a low cost fast decentralized network thats free for anyone all over the world. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 12:09:49
I could say the same thing. Go buy more bitcoin lol, follow the herd lol. Ive spend enough time already on morons like you.

@_date: 2018-11-24 22:35:02

I never said both things you are trying to claim. Nice try tho!
I am using fiat since there simply isnt another way, yet! The world still gets payed in fiat in case you didnt notice. What i do after i get my fiat is my business, who knows i maybe putting every single euro into crypto right away. 
In case i wasnt clear enough i do not feel the need to give you my fiat. Fiat on itself is worthless if you dont see that youre either really dumb or just stubborn and afraid of change.

@_date: 2018-11-24 22:55:06
The value off blockchain lies in its decentralization. This is why 99% of the cryptos are worthless, the power behind this is that anyone who is on the network has an equal vote over what is going to happen with it. Equal is the keyword of the blockchain. .
This makes pretty much every top 20 crypto with their ceos worthless. There are only a few decentralized networks.
 


It does not, what happens if we have another run on banks? Many will lose acces to their savings, or just lose them completely. We already saw this in 2008.


You can do all of this on a decentralized blockchain. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 15:49:35
And who do i need to trust? There must be some location where the gold is stored. It will work out the same way as banks today. What happens if everyone wants their gold back? 
I seriously think you need to reconsider whos the moron. Stop putting your trust in people, put your trust in technology instead.
Edit: just to inform you a bit more. The dollar used to be gold-backed till the goverment fucked over our grandparents and here we are, 100 years later, still accepting the same bullshit.

@_date: 2018-11-05 15:26:55


Again, if they are stupid enough to do that they should lose anything they have. 
Its 2018, almost anyone has internet.  If they fomo in without doing some basic research on market movements and btc or whatever crypto they want, its their own fault. 
But its pointless to keep arguing, you disagree with me, i disagree with you. Something we should just agree on. 
Different views my man. The world is a rough place.
@_date: 2018-11-23 10:25:19
Its not a necessity to buy that crap, there are/were plenty who just had some stuff lying around and started mining bitcoin with that. 
There are various methods to gain some btc. Its not just buying like youre implying.

A 2009 investigation concluded that Titor was likely the creation of Larry Haber, a Florida entertainment lawyer, along with his brother Morey, a computer scientist.[3]
Hes a hoax, none of this predictions have been right, yet. Nucleair war, US dividing into 5 smaller countries. Nothing. Whats to read about him?
Since ive done what you said you should now aswell. Read about the universe, and watch cosmos a space time odessy.

What i was trying to say with this is that the energy costs of keeping bitcoin secure are already on the same level as the entire country of Chili consumes in a year. 
This is an incredible amount.
Everyone is assuming bitcoin will easily go up to ATH even 30-40-50k (one million) are mentioned.
Why would a coin that uses this much energy to 'secure' the network reach such prices. You can call me stupid or dumb but i just cant wrap my head around this. 
The world is finally (sort of) agreeing global warming is a problem. In the netherlands more and more laws are being pushed on us to reduce our energy consumption.
Still here we are hoping the most expensive network ever seen to reach 50k.
You are right on the FOMO part since that is basic human instinct. But still why would btc go up to these outrageous numbers before the fomo kicks in. A lot of people i talk to daily absoluty hate btc purely because of the energy it needs. They havent invested in cryptocurrencies yet and wont untill a better solution comes around.
Blockchain deserves a better solution to secure a network. We deserve a better solution to secure a network. Whether that will be PoS or maybe something we havent heard of yet i dont know. 
Edit: saying btc needs such amounts of energy to secure a network is saying cars can only run safely on gas. Makes no sense, better solutions will come around and might even be around already.

While this might be true for some POS coins, especially with masternodes, it doesnt go for each and every one of em. .

You are mistaken here, its methane, mostly,  thats the problem. You know that gas that comes out of your ass when you fart. Some of us got a lot of it in their body, your fucking head must be filled with it.  CO2 is dealt with through plants. No problemo there. Not as much at least.

@_date: 2018-07-16 09:19:50
All of you, with your salty replies, show me i am on the right track. No one is able to show any facts or whatsoever to show why 70 twh, and increasing, isnt a problem. 
1970 sounded good since btc needs 70!! twh a year. 
And since btc still has no adoption i think 10 yrs is a pretty safe bet. It will take time to transform the world.
Keep laughing ill laugh at the end.

You are the one being deluded. All you do is create your own facts. Out of 7 billion people i am talking to the biggest luna on earth.
Its 2018 bro, the facts are on the table. Its 10 to 12 right now. 
The argument is flawed? Look at the bigger picture. You are so short sighted it isnt even funny. The entire earth is trying to cut energy consumption down. And here we have a still useless network comsuming 70 twh a year. How many times do you have to read 70 twh a year to understand how ridiculous that is.
Gold and banks consume more? That because btc still has no adoption. Easy. If btc would be the number 1 currency energy consumption would skyrocket above both banks and gold.
The only arguments against pos is it isnt tested, biggest bullshit ever.
And its not centralized, i have to degree on the masternodes part. But there are more solutions out there. 
The ones who laugh at this are just as short sighted as you are. And laugh all you want, i think the smart people will know which side to choose. Me being ridiculed by you only proves my point. 
Your mind is poopoo bro stop being this short sighted. There a new generation that actually wants to make something out of this.

I never said anything about inhaling or exhaling. Are you really this dumb? I was talking about photosynthesis. We indeed exhale co2, this isnt a problem though because of photosynthesis. Plants turn co2 into o2 which we can breathe again. You are supposed to learn that in 4th grade my mad man.
You are actually dumber than the back end of a cow. Which creates a lot of methane, and is the gas that is harming the environment. Not co2, at least not from us exhaling it. 
Edit: youve got a head full of cow farts,(methane) is it finally understandable for you now?

This community itself is going to cause bitcoins fall this way.

Since Its a global community i highly doubt any goverment will have a say about what happends to nav. Weve got developers basically anywhere in the world, from new zealand to the US. 
Its a small cap coin so its more vulnerable to attacks than bitcoin. If a rich guy wants to fully control the movement of the network he'll need to have over 50% of the circulating supply. I also doubt someone will ever be able to get 50+% since the coins are distributed by 50k community members. Wed all need to sell to give someone the ability to get the % needed. 
PoS doesnt need to be 'ponzi' like. It depends on the parameters. I agree masternodes etc are unfair and leave an adventage to rich people. 
Navcoin solves this by giving anyone who stakes a vote in the network. 100 votes with 1000 coins are just as powerfull as a rich guy with 100.000 coins voting. This is imo as fair as it gets. Arguably even fairer than bitcoin where you must join a pool when youre a small miner.
Staking nav with 1 coin will net you 7-10% a year. 
Stakinf nav with 1.000.000 coins will also net you 7-10% a year. I believe this is as equal as it can possibly get.
@_date: 2018-07-14 16:13:34
Alright we are not getting anywhere and you are starting to get insulting. 
Its not about btc because it could adapt to a different algo. The thing is pow costs way to much energy already, and this will only increase.
There is a big difference between energy coming from oil etc. Like 80-90% of our energy still does. Or cars running on renewable energy you are completely missing the point again.
Youre stuck in your btc pow mindset and thats your loss. Good luck further, and think about me when btc either dies for sticking with pow, or adapts to pos or whatever will be the meta.
Also gold is used for something. Jewelry etc. Btc has no adoption and uses 70+ twh a year. Think about it.
@_date: 2019-09-21 12:57:49
This will probably give me the ban.. 
NavCoin open source, decentralized, no pre mine. POS. Completely new perspective on inflation/deflation. Each year 2.1 million coins are minted which means this years inflation is at around 4%. Next year inflation drops by +-.2% and keeps dropping each year whilst never reaching 0% inflation. 
This years improvements, DAO, Community fund, new privacy protocol on the way, marketing campaign.
Version 4.7.0 almost finished which brings some major bugfixes, just like bitcoin needed those in its earlier years. Cold staking is done, and ledger integration being worked on.
Its a small cap coin with a hardworking community behind it that enables you to get involved no matter what your skillset is. Even translating can get paid via the CF.
I know tribalism is hard to overcome but bitcoin isnt the only project in the space that has the right ideas.

Maybe the navcoin core developers can help you. I think so at least. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 22:39:07
PoW energy consumption is the biggest problem. Bitcoin uses ,estimated, 71 Twh per year. This is outrageous and unsustainable. People who cant afford 1k miners dont even have to try.
PoS is the solution to this. The problem with PoS imo are masternodes. Masternodes are only for either early adopters or very wealthy people. 
There are also solutions to this. There are projects (PoS) that have maturing coins. So you can stake these coins with a small amount and still claim your reward. Of course it takes longer and the more coins you have the more weight you have. But at least everyone, no matter how wealthy can claim their % per year. 
Imo the fairest and most decentralized way of securing a network. 
Edit: ive no idea if LN will also fix the mining issues btc has.
Edit2: to the people downvoting, at least give a reply. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 08:31:23
Much decentralization
@_date: 2019-09-21 16:47:28


'A' Money has been around since forever, bitcoin wasnt first. Bitcoin was the first decentralized internet currency, that doesnt mean that its the only one. Decentralized is key here btw, internet currencies have been around much longer than that.


NavCoin is a coin because without a coin there wouldnt be a functioning decentralized blockchain. Like said before nav did not have an ICO or pre-mine. Every coin that is in navcoin circulation has been mined and later minted after the start. 
The initial creators of summercoin arent involved with navcoin anymore, the community survived and is still working on it with new developers. Those developers get paid via navs community fund. A portion of the minted coins get locked away and can only be used after the community has agreed to do so. 


Fair criticism should be based on what you know, you have literally no idea what youre talking about. Tribalism. Youre blind because of your maxi btc mindset, btc isnt the only community driven project that aims to do things right.
@_date: 2018-07-21 19:34:13

What 'features' did you find?
@_date: 2019-09-21 16:33:34
Why does btc need tokens is basically the same question. Makes no sense. 
NavCoin isnt a token, it is its own chain created in 2014 without pre-mine or ico just like btc once started. Only difference is there is no one in the navcoin community that mined 1.000.000 coins right at the start.
You are exactly what i ment with tribalism.

Option 2!!
@_date: 2019-09-22 12:13:40
I never thought my previous comment would be considered agressive, since that was the case i apologize. 
The blocksize issue is a good point to take into consideration but its not something the network needs to focus on at this stage imo. When it becomes an issue because of full blocks the community fund will pay for the expenses needed to fix it. Layers can always be added.
Whats innovative about navcoin is dandelion, a new (for nav) privacy protocol where the user has the option to either use a full private side chain, or use the open mainchain. This is afaik a new way of looking at privacy. 
Also because of the community fund anyone has the ability to be employed without any strings attached. You can propose an idea, the community votes and if accepted you start working on it. After certain milestones the fund pays whatever it owes you.
I think this brings a completely new form of working/employment the world has never seen before. Working for a community consisting out of thousands all over the world. After the work is done, you either go your own way or make a new proposal for a new idea. 
But yes, it is a bitcoin fork, and yes some parameters have been changed, for the better imo. Theres a reason the project grew +-40.000 people over the course of the last 2 years while the market dropped +-95%.

There are quite some people who spend crypto and then buy it back right after they bought something with it.
And yes there are also quite some who dont wanna spend because of fomo.
@_date: 2018-12-05 11:57:14
We know if we want to reach a point of adoption we need to spend it. Just letting it sit in a wallet wont do anything.
We also think to know it will increase in value coming years, thus we are fomoing and buying it back from exchanges.
