Sounds like I found my new brand. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 02:46:03
Is it a carton of misc brands? 
@_date: 2015-12-14 17:18:11
Thats terrible to hear. 
How much did you lose? (If you dont mind me asking)

Been not readding about btc for a bit. 
Low down on why people dislike coinbase? 
And if not them whom should I try to use to get some coinage? 
@_date: 2014-12-11 22:37:23
And with this announcement I'm officially going to start buying in. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 20:51:36
This explains why it's been climbing today.

The band needs to get with the times.  
@_date: 2014-10-09 21:07:11
Just a spectacular.  
But was dipping down the last few days and this happens and its up $100. 
Maybe connected. Or maybe just a coincidence.

Well when dealing with money 0% is always better. 
But the  the old adage comes into play. If its sounds to good to be true. It may be. 
(God Damn auto correct)

An exchange?

Never gamble with money you can't afford to lose. 
So using the money i would spend on smoking and picking up a little bit everyday. 
Was going to burn the cash literally, so figure this can give me something to do.

Thank you but curse you. 
@_date: 2016-02-27 12:19:58
Crap, i even went out of my way to make sure it was nice and rounded. 
@_date: 2016-02-26 08:17:07
I've been using circle and get them instantly. 
And only reopened my account a couple days ago. 
@_date: 2016-02-27 23:51:13
If i take the blue pill will it give me a dime? 
@_date: 2016-02-27 10:22:48
I've honestly watched it for about 2 years. 
It's still not making full economic cycles yet. But I'm hopeful. 
@_date: 2016-02-29 16:26:18
Can't only blame that I was half asleep when I posted this. So human error is to blame also.

In a wallet on a site called mt gox. 
Honestly personal wallet, on personal mobile that's locked. And the wallet is also locked and backed up via email. 
That's for the time being once I get a bit more weight may be looking into cold storage. But right now have about $50 worth, so not to pressed on that. 
 
@_date: 2016-02-27 02:06:03
Thats my plan put a coin in as a replacement for smokes. 
@_date: 2016-02-25 17:43:38
(Also emailed)
@_date: 2016-02-27 00:05:39
Why thank you. 
@_date: 2016-02-25 05:50:45
Ran into the same issue. 
@_date: 2016-02-27 00:12:21
If he's a stock broker, when you buy stock you buy a small percentage of a business. 
Bitcoin your buying, in his eyes nothing. Or the hope that someone in the future will want to buy that coin at the same price or a higher price then he paid for. But there is not anything literally backing his investment. 
I think all of us here believe that bitcoin will be something in the future. Thus why we invest. 
So I can see why he's apprehensive to invest in it. But with that, there have been plenty of people that have made/lost money investing in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-02-29 06:52:05
Never gamble with money you can't lose. 
I know alot on here view btc as a investment thst is foolproof. Which may be true. May not. 
So if you feel that you can survive after your sentence without it. I say go for it.

Honestly can see it as a good way to allow customers to use credit if the feds crack down on credit card processing of vape shops. 
Can buy the product with card, well you can buy btc in the shop and use that to pay for the product you want. 
The tin foil hat wearing person in me, can foresee a squeeze to this industry with through the cc processors. They have done it to other industries in the past.
@_date: 2016-02-29 16:21:36
I do and thank you. Corrected 
@_date: 2015-11-04 03:11:16
Im just happy my 0.0021 worth of bitcoin can buy me a soda agai . 
@_date: 2015-02-24 18:55:46
