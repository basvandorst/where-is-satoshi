It will be interesting to see without a doubt.  Lots of folks expect a big rise in the price, but I'm not so sure:  The options will provide a leveraged bet on both long and short.  So there is a possibility that all the people who think bitcoin is a fraud will go short.

So I think there's a complication that is unappreciated right now.  Yes, you can go buy puts when CME opens.  But typically, the person on the other side of the transaction (ie selling a put) will protect themself by shorting the underlying (and buying a call).  At the moment, it's pretty difficult to short bitcoin.
As a consequence, I think the premia for puts is going to be pretty much whoppingly large.
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:36:21


I think that's a pretty big understatement.  CME will cause a vast increase in liquidity.

There are two sides to every transaction:  When someone buys a call, the sophisticated sellers of the call will often purchase the underlying (and then buy a put for locked-up gains.)
I would expect an increase the the daily volume.  The real question is how much of an increase in short positions (from people selling covered puts) will occur.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:19:17


Yes it is possible.  
However, remember there are two sides to every trade.  E.g. The person selling a call has (in theory) unlimited liability.  So often, they own the underlying.

While true, you are missing the some of the subtext:  In the Roman world, the denarius is quite famous as part of the currency.

At a price determined in the future?  
The usual way this works (choosing the call as an example):  You have a seller that will offer to sell at a premium in the future (tomorrow for these contracts), and a buyer that thinks things are going up.  So they give the seller his price, and collect any extra amount.  Since the price differential is not too large, you magnify it by leverage.
If that can be done today, I've missed it.

The usual ancient example is the Roman sestertius, which was made of mostly silver iirc.  As the empire ran into trouble, the coins started getting shaved, which is nothing other than inflation by another name.  People kept the price constant, but it was being paid with "bad money" ie money with smaller amounts of metal.
Another canonical example is John Law, some of the first paper money from banks:  
As it turns out, the opposite of Gresham's Law (which you were talking about in your original comment) is named Thier's Law.  Like many things in economics, you have two laws which are completely contradictory. :)  But each idea has its uses and conditions.
 
Edit:  Looks like you already found the reference.  Nevertheless, there's a pretty rich monetary history going back 1000's of years.

Not sure a lot of you are familiar with futures:
1.  "Wall street is crashing bitcoin to maximize later profits".  You can buy puts as well as calls, so moving the price down would profit just as much.  No need to crash it now.
2.  "No naked shorting"  bfd.  Naked shorts on the futures is not an issue, it's naked shorts on the stocks themselves.
3.  Buying a call means that you have to right (but not the obligation) to buy bitcoin from your counterparty on a particular date at a particular price.   This is not anything remotely like an ETF.
4.  Conversely, buying a put means that you have to right (but not the obligation) to sell bitcoin to your counterparty on a particular date at a particular price.   This is not anything remotely like an ETF.
5.  Bitcoin people are regularly confusing "fractional reserve" with "fraud".  Selling something you do not own is fraud.  Selling something that you borrow and promise to pay back later naturally results in fractional reserve.  In any case, neither of these terms has anything to do with a futures market.

Plenty of companies have a negative balance sheet (and hence no value), but a positive share price.
@_date: 2017-09-22 17:26:49
OK, maybe this is easier to understand in the other direction.  Say you want to sell a swap instead of buy:
1. The swap contract is at (current price + P).  So I can buy bitcoin at the current price and sell it tomorrow, and profit by the amount P, by selling the swap.
2.  The differential P is probably not very large (or there won't be a buyer).  So I will take a short-term loan (from a third party).
3.  The lender will demand collateral, which will be the bitcoin that I buy today.
4.  The third party will not allow me to borrow 100% against the bitcoin (because the price may drop), but maybe they'll allow me 80%. 
5.  So I magnify P by 4 times by taking the loan, for the amount of money that I put in.
This is not something that you can do without the contract, because it depends on someone (the buyer of the swap) betting that the price is moving by more than the premium over the term of the contract.
