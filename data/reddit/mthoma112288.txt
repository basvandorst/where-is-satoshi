I am actually part of a new crypto-centric website looking for knowledgable crypto-enthusiast to contribute. We are holding a contest of sorts for writers willing to profile different coins. This is your chance to break into the industry!
If you're interested in contributing, pick a coin from the list below and any one aspect of the coin you'd like to cover (like governance, the tech, security, community, etc.) and submit your best summary in ~750 words or less. For many of you you've already done this in some old posts! But feel free to submit something new and up-to-date.
The chosen winner(s) will get the chance to contribute to the site, have their name or social media handle displayed next to their work on the site, and have the possibility for future, more lucrative work.
Deadline for submissions are July 5th 7:00 PM Pacific Time. Please submit drafts for consideration with your name or Reddit handle to CryptoEq
Hope to hear from you soon!
