So what is an easy to use wallet/app that is a good alternative for aomeone new?  
Coinbase is stupid easy, but the fees suck and it is slow.

You can try to deny all you want, I was there and I saw the graves.  
My wife lived through it.
You dont need to believe it, bit it happened.

Lol ok.  Missed a lot of "ethnic cleansing" lessons in history didn't you.
Kosovo is independant now, and no longer a part of Serbia.  Thats what happens when you try to destroy an entire people....  
@_date: 2019-03-14 21:21:38
No.... No it isn't.
Kosovo declared their independence in 2008.  Believe it or not, like ot or not,  they are no longer part of Serbia, and serbia has no power there.

Exactally why the United Kingdom still rules over the United States right....?
@_date: 2019-03-14 21:19:19
Kosovo is an independant state no longer a part of Serbia.

Well someone should have told that to the squads of soldiers walking through gjilan, ferizaj, prizeren and all the other places they raped, tortured and killed on village wide scales...
Maybe official "policy" wasn't genocide, but it was happening.  I've seen mass graves friend, first hand.  What happened there was an attempt at genocide.  Families, women, children brutally raped and murdered.
@_date: 2019-03-16 01:03:42
No.  The Serbian attempted genocide of the Albanians in Kosovo.

You can carry 10 million if you want, you just have to make a declaration of it
