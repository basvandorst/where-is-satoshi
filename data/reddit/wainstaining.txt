No are biggest problem in politics is that money in politics is hidden. We need to make unlimited direct donations legal, but enforce 100% transparency. Also we need term limits on congress.

Lol make bitcoin usable as a currency and maybe more people would support it.

It’s better because I know where politicians are getting their money from, instead of invisible and untraceable super pacts. Also limiting monetary donations is a limit on free speech, and the founders made the first amendment in order to protect what they deemed to be the most important type of speech - political speech.

If I give you a dollar is not not saying my support for you? In what way is that not speech. 
An example on open money elections is Oregon. A state that has great bipartisanship in the senate and the house. All donations must be reported within 24 hours if they are during the campaign season, which allows for complete transparency. If I see a corporation that I don’t like donating to a candidate, guess what, I’m not going to vote for them, and I’ll tell everyone I know not to vote for them. Currently money in us politics has been pushed underground, making it untraceable, and keeping the public in the dark. 
Also if you going to complain about corporations using money in politics you have to look at unions as well. Which when everything calculated spend around the same amount of money on elections every year. I’m sure you know about fcc v Citizen United. You probably disagree with the decision (I don’t) but if instead of a anti-Hillary-conspiracy film it was a movie in support of Obama funded by planned parent hood, would you still say that the organization/company can’t spend money to do that?

Take everything you read on r/bitcoin with a good dose of skepticism- it’s openly hostile towards bcash, and promotes bitcoin.

And yet sometimes they are right. The authoritarian mods here really are annoying. On btc I can make fun of roger ver calling him a firework terrorist and I just get downvoted not banned.

Fuck the Venezuelan government. Bunch of corrupt pieces of shit.  Seizing private industries, taking control of the media. I find it hilarious that Jeramy Corbin and Bernie Sanders have said that the “American dream is more alive in Venezuela”.
Stay strong my friend.

Only two people in this world who use that word. Cucks, and white supremacists.
