Where is a good place to buy? With Coinbase down, I don't know the best place to go.

As in, I spend $100 USD today, I get $100 USD worth of BTC on Friday.

Thank you, guy of the internet! I tried telling clients that I accept bitcoin. But they just kind of laugh. They won't be laughing for long.

In my experience, it takes me almost a week to get coin. I bought at $420 last week, still haven't received it. If this can be expedited, I'm looking for a way, too.

Amen! Now only if Coinbase had COINS!

Just the tip. For miners.

One of us, one of us...

You're amazing. Thank you!

Aw, shucks. I figured as much. 
The truth is that I was really down on my luck. I had a small surplus of money, bought coin, and life got in the way shortly thereafter. So I took it out and this rollercoaster shot right up! Bad timing. So now I hold about .25 BTC and naturally would like to acquire more.

Yeah, I got some of those. But they're coming in at Friday's price, right?
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:44:52
Here's the thing: You're getting billed what you paid. You're just getting that amount in BTC on Friday. Your bank account is cool.

0.3 here. Better than nothing! I buy in dribs and drabs, because that's what I can afford.

Hey, if you want in, you should be watching NOW.

If I can help in the branding/design department, I'd work for BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:56:39
For me, yes. I have no idea why. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. But it does keep me from panic selling lol!

It's still WORLDS away from where it was this morning. It's still UP! Be grateful for the little drop, now you know what BTC is capable of, and you have a chance to buy.
