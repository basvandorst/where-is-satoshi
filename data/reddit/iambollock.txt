Because they're lying.

Ahh well it was exciting for 5 minutes. 
Hoax everybody, nothing to see here.
@_date: 2014-12-07 01:58:52
Also, dealers don't take cards.
@_date: 2015-07-30 16:53:40
That's what google says it's worth right now.
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:14:02
Oh ok thanks.
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:49:36
What's happening then?
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:56:08
What makes you say this?
@_date: 2013-04-22 14:08:05
If you think that though, why not go all the way and request only analogue notifications? Your ISP could just pull the plug for all websites, not just facebook.
Yes facebook or twitter could just shut down, so could your e-mail account you're so ready to rely on, but we trust those places and that's why these companies use them.

This is what trading with lag looks like.

Unfortunately it seems to be the speculation of choice for a lot of big news outlets.

Upvoted for Klute, haven't heard anything from that guy in years.
@_date: 2013-04-16 18:21:19
...but the website is still up and trading normally.
Is that odd? I've never used the API.
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:22:53
Sorry I didn't catch that would you mind showing us again?
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:18:22
"In a wild ride possibly linked to a reddit user"
Eh? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:54:01
One guy alone lost 6000, this is a major fuckup.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:15:27
Especially when the giftees didn't even sell their bitcoins before the crash.

Dude, it's just some DJ using this subreddit for easy promotion. He has no music or current album to make another one the 'next' one. He has no buy page to sell his music with bitcoins. All he has is a souncloud with 6 followers and a few DJ mixes... which by the way calling DJ mixes 'free' is a joke in itself.
If we upvote everyone who even mentions bitcoins without actually looking at each case then this subreddit is going to be full of easy and lazy self promotion.
Support the actual artists who are actually selling stuff with bitcoins, not people like this.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:07:47


...and when do we think that might be? Tomorrow morning?
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:33:09
How are we meant to buy when everything is down!?!
@_date: 2013-04-18 02:16:25
Soundcloud link with 6 followers and only one original song, slap on the promise that your 'next' album will be purchasable with bitcoins... and it gets upvoted.
 
@_date: 2013-04-18 16:46:21


Most 'djs' make their own original tracks. 


No shit.


He deleted the post because I called him out - I didn't scare off a hardworking DJ looking to help bitcoin grow, I caught someone trying to use this subreddits inclination to upvote anything saying they're 'now accepting bitcoin' for some easy promotion.

I was replying to your points on why you don't like facebook, obviously.


What's your point here? You think this shows that they'll take down customer announcements? Or that they can? Where's the value in that? Where's the precedent? I don't want to sound like I'm accusing you of wearing a tin-foil hat again, but damn does it look like you have a nice shiny hat.


It's the internet, as long as you're using an ISP people will have the power to shut it down.


Well, you can follow more people you're interested in, you can turn it into your own personalised bitcoin feed if you like. I was just offering pointing out that you only get updates from people you follow because you were acting like you have to sift through some unpreventable wall of nonsense. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 13:32:53


What? No, just no. You act like people use Facebook as a news source, as their *only* news source. You mention splitting 'the flow of information tightly' - like we're all sharing top secret leaks that facebook is going to pull down, calling it the single point of failure is ridiculous, you act like anyone that signs up to it is doomed to converse only through there for all eternity. 
Dude, the only info I get from facebook is what my mates did at the weekend and updates from any pages I follow. It's not some worldwide secret sharing site. Facebook only has what you tell it.
As for using you as a product, I agree with that, it sucks that they just see us as pre-done market surveys but it does nothing that affects me negatively, especially since all the info on my facebook is wrong anyway.


Yet you still haven't given a reason other than 'I don't want to use that shit'.


You only get updates from people you follow.
This is like trying to convince my nan that the microwave won't eat her.

Isn't that standard with these things?
