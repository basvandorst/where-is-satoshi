Kind of like MySpace. Everyone used MySpace. At one point it had more traffic than Google. There came other sites like MySpace, but people used MySpace. Until they didn’t.

I used Coinbase but now I am locked out of that account because at certain point they changed the rules and insisted I provide personal information to get in. Still have to figure out how to get my money back. BitGo so far didn’t ask for any personal information so i continue to use them for now.  All other options I found required personal info.

Thank you for the information. It seems BitGo concerns may be legitimate. I’ll investigate what other 2fa options they support. Authy was nicely simple.

I’ll take a look, thank you.

Thank you. I actually thought Authy was a Google project, thank you for the info.

Supposedly steps were taken to prevent this in the future.. But that’s why my BitGo wallet doesn’t have too much in it at any one time. Having Bitcoin privacy is worth the risk right now.

Hi Olga, thank you for your reply. I did send the funds to a new address. Does this delay happen only once? Or will it happen every time I send bitcoin to a new address? Even when I send funds to my own secondary non-coinbase wallet, the address is always new — does that mean Coinbase will create a delay every time? I mean, “face match”? Don’t you think it is little too invasive?
 
Also, when creating the transaction, Coinbase dynamically calculates the network/miner fees that are included. This calculation is done at the time the transaction was created, right? In other words, it will not reflect conditions that will be 3 days from now? Isn’t it possible that the miner fee will be too small and I will have to wait much longer for that transaction to be cleared by the bitcoin network?

Not a problem. And thanks for the links btw.  I may be outside of NY this weekend so will try to find Bitcoin ATM if I can. I have a friend in Vegas who could probably do that for me too, but I am not sure if machines in Vegas require ID.

I come from a place where citizens were constantly monitored. Yes, there was very little crime.  There is always a “good reason” to limit privacy (money laundering, save the children, say no to drugs, etc etc), the problem is that there is no limit to that. Anyway, I don’t know how money laundering works, but I assume it is done with significant amount of money to be worth it. Perhaps the government could allow transactions below certain amount uninhibited.

It figures.

No, I mean a machine I don’t have to trust about misusing my personal information. If the machine doesn’t have it in the first place, it can’t be misused.

So does Finland have super high crime rate and lots of money laundering? :-)
@_date: 2016-05-19 15:16:15
I don’t know if this is true or just a folk tale, but I remember reading that money laundering was long time ago a real thing that actually involved washing money. That some very rich families/dynasties found it distasteful to handle used money and had their staff actually wash/clean them.

Thank you for these!  Do you know if Coinsource only requires phone number for ATMs in NY, or is it required for any of their machines no matter where they are located?
 
Update: According to their faq, phone is required. Too bad.

This used to be so simple. Feed money to the machine, find Bitcoin in your wallet. There also used to be person-to-person transactions where you’d meet up with someone to buy Bitcoin from. Is that now illegal too?
@_date: 2016-05-18 18:05:44
Sorry, the info I saw in those links seems to indicate that there is no way to get Bitcoin without personal ID in NY. Did I overlook something?

Collecting personal information is also means to inhibit free speech and privacy. Those are actually benefits of Bitcoin that are being undermined in the guise of fighting money laundering.
