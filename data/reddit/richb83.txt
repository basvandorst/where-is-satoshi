How much would have this been in dollars?
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:47:34
Could you use that to get to work and how much would parking cost in the city?

We need more posts like this because this sub makes me feel like each one of you has hundreds of full bitcoins. I'm not like you big dawgs but I'm out here trying to feel good about my .10th of one.

It's behind a paywall
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:36:37
Why waste all that BTC on a car?

What good is all that money at 90 yrs old?
@_date: 2018-05-14 20:50:39
Same here. I think for many people crypto still doesn't feel like real money. Perhaps there will be some kind of psychological effect where people are much more willing to send in crypto instead of taking that hit of submitting credit card info.

The Gambling industry in the US is probably about to explode with today's ruling. I'm guessing many new companies will sprout up to fill the market and many of them will probably be just online companies. To me it seems like Bitcoin can easily make its way onto these sites as an option for account funds.

That’s cute

Legal gambling has to be good news right? 
@_date: 2017-08-13 22:43:55
This is my first post. Thanks for not overracting 
@_date: 2017-08-13 22:44:11
This is the first time I asked. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:44:08
If that’s the case it will be easier to get back on the ride for everyone else that missed the last run.

Can we keep going?

I'd venture to say that [1.5 million]( American families would agree.

Is it really that complicated for you to not see how using words like "measly" and "spare change" to describe what could be a months worth of groceries for the average American household can be construed as a transparent humble brag when the basis of your post doesn't have any content of value or helpful information for this sub? This really shouldn't be as difficult to understand as you are making it out to be. I mean what was your intention with this post? 
@_date: 2018-03-15 14:48:12
You are not convincing me your point of the post was to try a impress us by saying $300 is spare change for you and that you can easily purchase 1 full BTC later on. I don't think you are convincing anyone else either because now you keep throwing the word jealousy around. Trust me dude, my life is full and valuable enough to not get jealous over money issues. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:16:25
It was written 
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:42:41
equating a "measly" $300 as spare change in a time where the average family is struggling to pay their bills is indeed bragging. This shouldn't be that difficult to comprehend. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:46:05
$300 is groceries and diapers my dude, so yes that is a significant amount of money.

Not looking forward to following-up on my Bitcoin conversations with extended family members 2mrw.  
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:43:56
Is the entire point of this post is to try and brag about how much money this guy has? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:27:22
make it stop 
@_date: 2018-07-11 21:44:46
