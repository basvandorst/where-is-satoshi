  Jesus Christ that was back in the day. And seriously, man, *72* is "Bad news"?!?! - If I just *found* 72 btc lying around, I'd throw a small party in my dorm. With like, hookers and blackjack.

  What on earth is an "aggregate popular vote"? County wins and your "50 popular votes" make no difference to the actual total votes outcome, or the electoral college. How's Trump campaign promise to make Mexico pay for the wall directly coming, by the way? Last time I checked, the trade deficit between the US and Mexico wasn't just lying around in a dumpster of $100 bills somewhere.

? I'm angry that Trump won, sure, but I'm not saying that he's somehow stolen the election. I'm very aware of how the Electoral College works, thank you very much. I still am totally missing how your "aggregate popular vote" works. Or do we not count all the votes of people who voted anymore?  
  
  I'm an Irish dual citizen, in Ireland we use STV, single transferable vote. There's a nationwide election for president. Despite how STV manipulates vote work, everyone gets a "vote". I dislike the Electoral College, and I've disliked it well before this election. I'll continue to dislike it. I've said my piece.  
  
  The is how's everybody's investments holding up? I've still kept my stuff going well. Just upgraded my setup after my last computer died, didn't want to lose any track.

In reference to why I originally left - How's Mnuchin in office working out for y'all?  
  
  This is astronomically stupid - I'm somehow even less incensed by this whole issuance order for Bitcoin than I am for this "transporting more than 10k in cash is illegal" thing. That's just stupid.
