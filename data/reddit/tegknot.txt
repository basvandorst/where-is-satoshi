That wouldn't create a "real" market. It will create a "speculative" market on a limited resource. Bitcoin is already speculative enough. Let's have real business people look at the cost of running miners and decide for themselves how much profit they need on top of that to have a successful business. Being afraid that there will always be someone willing to sell for less is bad business. Those that don't take in enough revenue will go out of business.
I sell retail online so I deal with being "undersold" all the time, it's part of business and it's how a real economy works.

He seems confused about what "consensus" means, or maybe society is changing the meaning with the lead of the "climate change" people.
He also has a confusing, to me anyway, discussion about the block size and how it affects economics. The fact is that block size IS a centrally planned affect on the Bitcoin economy, but so is the limit of coins, so there is an argument for that being a good thing, though I don't agree.
I agree that a fear of economic change shouldn't be a major consideration in and of itself. But we are talking money here, not spreadsheet software. Affects on the economics of Bitcoin will have large consequences in the future, even if they are small now.
And why the fuck does he keep talking like there isn't a fee market? There isn't an imposed fee market due to lack of space on The Blockchain, but there most certainly has been a fee market for a long time.

Careful. Coinapult locks in your dollar value, but you don't keep the same bitcoin.
If you buy 1 BTC at $400 and then lock it in Coinapult, and bitcoin's price goes to $800 you will only be getting 0.5 bitcoin back when you unlock it.

Of course the reverse is true also. If you buy that same $400 coin and the BTC price goes to $200 you can then unlock 2 bitcoins.

I think it would be very hard not to convert at least some to fiat. While there are businesses that accept it, most all utility companies want fiat and have a monopoly. Hard to run a business without electricity and internet.

I think they will, and hope they do, because competition is good. But how often do you hear about Discover Card? It's a successful credit card that was created by a large financial institution (Sears) in 1985. Do you think Discover Card will ever be the top credit card?

This isn't exactly the case with Amazon. When you're shopping on Amazon, you're looking at products offered from thousands of different merchants. I'm one of them. But many of these merchants aren't very smart and sell for prices that could never sustain a business because they have to pay the credit card payment they charged all those products on. Competition is what lowers prices on Amazon mostly, but yes there is a bit of the "big brother" thing going on too.

While your second point holds a little water, your first is disproven here:

1. While I don't think "law" is necessary for money to work, some agreements, or rules are pretty important. With cryptocurrency those rules are built into the protocol.
2. The perpetrator and anyone who knowingly assists them should "bear the brunt of the legal liability." That's how it should be in all instances. (When I say "knowingly" I mean that they specifically help to perpetrate a crime, not just supply some tools to do so.)
3. No regulation. If for no other reason than that it would be nearly impossible. We don't need another "war on drugs" to blow money and resources on. As I know that the "no regulation" thing won't really happen, the governments need to make it clear exactly what they want, and what they will enforce and not leave people hanging.
4. I believe cryptocurrencies will be the most used form of currency in the future. I don't know when that will happen. Could be as little as 10 years, or as many as 50, my uneducated guess would be 20-25 years. I do think fiat will still be around for a good long time though.

Again, a full of shitter taking a narrow view. Yes, using bitcoin for remittances doesn't currently ad much (if any) value. But when bitcoin is accepted by most everyone then the conversion fees won't apply.

If I understand it correctly, which is certainly questionable. You only need to worry about AML/KYC if you're a third party. Someone directly selling their own bitcoin isn't responsible for those regulations. I would guess that if you are doing very large transactions, or very frequent transactions with the same people you might get on law enforcement's radar.

Any new currency is going to have challenges being adopted. Even if you really get a significant community behind BitUSD who's going to use that? You may have eliminated the volatility, but there isn't a store anywhere that accepts it. And while volatility is certainly a problem for Bitcoin adoption, BitUSD has a lot of the problems that Bitcoin solves. I don't believe Bitcoin will be the only successful cryptocurrency,  but I do believe it will be number one for a long time to come.

Again, if a currency functions in a deflationary manner, than what then encourages investment and economic development?
Because you want your money's value to grow faster. Why only make 10% when you can make 20%.
Also, people won't feel so much like they have to invest, so they might keep some "cash" available to invest when they see something that is real exciting. As it stands, holding fiat is loosing money; so investors scramble around looking for anything with a yield instead of holding out for truly good investments. Imagine how much better the world would be if more investment went to worthwhile businesses that actually create something people want.

I am a seller on Amazon and live off the earnings and only work about 20 hours a week at it. I'm also a big supporter of Bitcoin and would like to see Amazon accept it.
But, being a seller there makes me think they are being honest about customer interest - at least for the customers they are targeting.
Amazon loves to sell to anyone, but the customer base that they, and I, really want to sell to are the Prime members. Prime members are willing to pay a significant premium for the convenience of free 2 day shipping and being able to just go to one site and find what they want. These people are professionals that work 60+ hours a week including commute and just want things easy. They don't have the time or the desire to figure out new payment methods.
About the cost. Amazon has no problem at all spending money on something they think will generate more sales. That is why their profits are fairly low relative to their size - all the profits are reinvested into growth. Amazon wants to rule online retail, and that's where the money goes. If they thought Prime members wanted Bitcoin they wouldn't worry very much about how much it cost to implement.

It's funny to me that anyone thinks they really know what needs to happen for Bitcoin to take off. Some say "HODL!" while others say "get merchants on board!" and then others say "we need to make it easy to use!" "security is the key!" "Regulation!" "Education!"
You people are all full of shit. There is no one thing that will make Bitcoin take off. It will take all of these things working together. And you full of shitters will say "you're right about most of those, but not regulation because that stifles Bitcoin."
Again, you're full of shit. Regulation will help and hinder. Obviously not many Bitcoin start-ups will be happening in NY in the near future, but bitcoin wouldn't even exist if it weren't for the hate of regulation. Do you think innovations like Dark Wallet or Open Bazaar would exist if it weren't for regulation?
The hodlers are full of shit. Yes, hodling will increase the monetary value of Bitcoin, but it will stifle "intrinsic" value. You could have a bar of gold in your backpack and feel pretty rich until you take it to the grocery store and try to get some food. If all we do is hodl, that's the scenario we will have.
My point is, start thinking holistically. Just because some yahoo makes a good argument for why merchant acceptance, or hodling, or regulation, or education, etc. is the one great key to Bitcoin's success doesn't make it true. Do what feels best to you and encourage others to do the same.

Your example suggests a "pure-bitcoin economy" but I doubt that will ever happen. Even if we went to a pure cryptocurrency economy there would still be inflation as new coins and currencies are created and added to the economy.
I do think that this will be much more driven by demand so inflation/deflation will more closely follow GDP. People will always want easy ways to make exchanges. Currently the US dollar is the easiest throughout the world because the infrastructure is in place to make it that way.

First off let me say that I mainly use a credit union and recommend that. Banks are seriously screwed up.
I think there is a misconception about banks and bitcoin. No one ever says how much they were transferring when their bank accounts were closed, and my guess is that the banks don't want to deal with money laundering investigations, or spousal theft.
When they see several thousand dollar transactions taking "real" money out of bank accounts to buy "fake" money in a irreversible transaction they get scared that they are going to have to do a whole lot more paperwork, and get a reprimand for allowing "bad" transactions.
I doubt it's fear of bitcoin as much as laziness, and fear of other consequences. So let the down-voting begin since I'm not supporting the conspiracy theories.

I think this is being looked at incorrectly.
Yes, Facebook is the winner on social media, and when two things are almost the same one will usually take the whole market.
But then you look at eBay and Amazon. They are pretty similar at their core, but offer enough differences that they coexist successfully.
With this in mind, Litecoin would seem to be doomed while something like Ethereum or Stellar might work alongside Bitcoin. (This is not a plug for any alts, I'm all bitcoin at this point. But I buy and sell on both eBay and Amazon.)

My guess is that it's either your bank, or you don't have an established relationship with Coinbase. 4 larger transactions in a week can look pretty suspicious.

Here are three more versions.
@_date: 2014-06-07 19:35:02
First, while banks might want to do this they are usually pretty careful about not stealing in a way that they can be caught, and whoever did this would most likely get caught.
Governments might want to do this but I just don't see it happening. Maybe I'm naive, but it just seems too sci-fi conspiracy theory-ish to me.
While it would be a huge deal and very impractical we could go back to the block from before the breach. Then forensically find the double spends, and only include the "valid" transactions in the new redone blocks. At this point it wouldn't be that hard since there aren't that many transactions a day.

I currently have a business selling on Amazon, and here is the problem I see.  I could sell a lot more if I could buy a lot more. So if I have a good portion of money tied up in these extra escrow accounts while I wait a week+ for my customers to sign I can't use that capital to buy more product. I'm pretty sure most businesses that do any sort of volume won't want to use the two-party trust-less escrow.
It could possibly work well for large low volume transactions like real estate or luxury items, but I doubt it will catch on there either.

I don't think there is anything wrong with your point of view about Bitcoin, but complaining about enthusiasts being enthusiastic on a forum about that subject seems a little off. If you're not that into it why are you reading/posting on these forums?
Just to let you know where I'm coming from. I consider not looking at these forums every day because it's such an emotional roller coaster with all the polarization of people who feel strongly one way or another about Bitcoin. But

I'm not saying there aren't some hard questions that need answers about side chains, but it feels like you've made a decision without thinking it through. First off the sidechain code will be open source which greatly weakens many of your arguments about centralization. I'm also not too concerned about "GovernmentCoin." Remeber the people who want to leave "the system" now have the tools. NewBitcoin can always be created from what we've learned. All I'm saying is that while I think your concerns are valid, they aren't end-of-Bitcoin scenarios. Remember that even after the printing press was invented only a few had control of them.

Well, there is no such thing as a currency that inflates or deflates "in value constantly" I'm sure a lot of people would like that, but it's a pipe dream. Bitcoin will not do that either. In fact it has inflated over the last year. I admit that I consider the deflationary aspect of bitcoin a positive, but it isn't a huge deal to me. What I like is that governments and central banks will have a much harder time manipulating the monetary base to suit their own ends. I want the free market to decide the value of currency. In the short term it will be a little more bumpy, but we also won't see giant crashes like we did in 2008, because the market will be more nimble, correcting more quickly.

The word inflation has two meanings.
1. The increase of money supply. Bitcoin is inflationary by this definition.
2. Decrease in buying power. In 1970 a candy bar cost 10 cents in USD, now it costs a dollar. By this definition bitcoin is deflationary.

While your post has some truth to it, you are making assumptions about all bitcoiners based on r/bitcoin posts. Saying things like "the dominant Bitcoin line." Yes, here on reddit the community has become a bit reactionary, and it does get quite annoying at times. Part of this is due to "trolls," who just like causing reactions, and part of it is religious. It's normal human behavior to join a group and then defend the "group think" from any dissenters. If this didn't happen we would all be considered psychopaths.
The fact is, no one on earth reads r/bitcoin, so I'm not too worried about a few "ugly" posts or down-voting ruining Bitcoin.

One of my first transaction after opening an account with my credit union was to purchase bitcoin through Coinbase and I've done several purchases since. (I've also used B of A and Wells Fargo too.) No one has said anything to me.
My business isn't dependent on any particular bank so I'm not worried about it. I think it was a good idea to ask. 
I have wondered why some bitcoin company hasn't either partnered with or started their own credit union to help bitcoin transition with US dollars. I've heard that Coinbase only has 1 bank they work with, which seems a bit risky.

Because there aren't any that do anything special that Bitcoin can't do with a little development, and Bitcoin has first mover advantage.
Darkcoin is cool, but it's not needed because we have Dark Wallet for Bitcoin. Fastcoin is cool, but isn't really needed because most transactions (because they're small) don't need confirmations etc.
Maybe someone will come up with a SuperDuperCoin that's way cooler than Bitcoin (I hope they do), but I think that by the time that happens Bitcoin will be so entrenched that it will take a good while to move away from it.

Here is how I understand it. If you're running a business selling coffee you have to report all your gains and losses, so if you sell someone a coffee for $4 worth of bitcoin and cash that out the next day for $5 you need to report that gain.
If you are the customer buying coffee with bitcoin you earned at your job that pays in bitcoin and the value went up before buying the coffee you don't have to report that. It's like cash back on your credit card. I have a card that pays me 1.5% on my purchases. I don't have to report that "earning" to the IRS. I might also use a coupon for a dollar off the coffee. I don't report that dollar "gained" to the IRS.
I could be wrong, but I think this is what dblcross121 (the tax attorney) is getting at.

Well I'm a bitcoin believer and expect my investment to rise by just holding it. But, I also invest some of my bitcoin on BTCJam for 2 reasons. I make MORE money that way. And I help people like a guy in Venezuela who needed to fix his backhoe so he could rent it out for summer construction jobs.
And there are many businesses that don't really contribute much to the economy. Banks have become one industry that's hurting more than helping, not lending to real businesses that are building real capital but just investing in more fucking bonds and stock in many companies that haven't had any "real" growth, but are just stock bubbles.

I agree with redditribbit1.  There are more bidders than there will be winners and those "loosers" already have money set aside to buy bitcoin. And I think they will probably put at least some of it into bitcoin whether they win or not.
Just the fact that someone is willing to bid more than me shows that demand is there. If I bid $590 and someone wins with $610 that shows me that people are willing to pay $610 and the people who pay $610 must believe it will be worth more than that or they wouldn't bid that much.

A lot of people bring up merged mining encouraging consolidation, and while I do believe there is some risk of that, there are two probable solutions.

Once someone writes easy to use merged mining software it won't only be a few people that can do it.

Not everyone will accept the bux of course, but Chase will partner up with builders and real estate people and they'll tell you all about how "you can buy a brand new house or a new car from one of our partner companies with Chase Bux! Just borrow some from us!"

I think you're both wrong.
The technology of decentralization will allow us to become LESS dependent on the state. The state will be around for a long long time, just like the Catholic church is still around even though the printing press was invented giving everyone the opportunity to read the Bible for themselves. The Pope lost a lot of power to the press, but it didn't eliminate that power completely. But now there is a choice as to whether you want to consider him your leader.
With decentralization people will have more choices, which is good. For a long time to come I think they will pretty much stick to what we have now - but 200 years from now things will look a lot different because of decentralization even though we will still probably have a less powerful central authority structure. Maybe people will just pick the government that they prefer similar to how people pick religions now. The exiled Nepali people are already doing something like that.

The beauty of Bitcoin isn't that every transaction is recorded. The beauty is that you can choose to do it all on the blockchain and transact without third parties or you can do the other thing. Choices are fucking amazing. If people want to run "fractional reserve" bitcoin banks and take risks with their money they can. If they don't want to they don't have to. In the current system we don't have that choice.

I feel sorry that I'm a part of such a paranoid and mean community. Maybe it is a scam, but holy crap do you people have to be such ass-holes? What if it isn't? Hey, state a warning that you think it sounds suspicious but just saying "BULL SHIT" is just crappy behavior.
Second. The same thing happened to me. It was only 0.77 BTC in my case but it still hurt. I had downloaded what I thought was Dark Wallet from a malicious site and they gained access to my whole computer. And since my 2FA went to my Google voice they got that from my email right on my computer. 2FA should go to a phone number that does not go to your computer you use to access Coinbase.

You people have no idea how business works. There is this thing called advertising, and it's somewhat expensive. And eBay does a lot of it. Guess what. I have a very successful business that supports my family selling on Amazon and I pay them around 30%! (That does include fulfillment)
I get so tired of people complaining about the fees that eBay or Amazon charge for selling. Those places are fucking amazing for making money. A heavy week for me is 20 hours of work!
If you can't make money on one of those venues, even with the fees, then you need to go work for someone who knows how to run a business and understands there are costs.
That being said, I'm very excited to move my business over to OpenBazaar or whatever else is good (Yes, I've sold a couple of things on CrytoThrift) but I'm not excited to have to start doing my own advertising. I'm hoping that there will be people that are good at it that will start up that service so I can pay someone else to do it, like I do now with Amazon. Real businesses will be perfectly happy to pay 5-20% of there revenue to advertising services, because they work.

Right, where they exchange fiat for bitcoin. If a bunch of people deposited fiat, bought bitcoin and then (smartly) withdrew their bitcoin. And then more people deposit fiat and want to buy bitcoin they could run short. Exchanges can't "print" bitcoin like a bank can "print" fiat. So, to sell bitcoin they don't have they would have to do fractional reserve, which is currently a big no-no in the cryptocurrency world.

You are wrong. It's much different because the difficulty has already more than doubled since bitcoin was at $215. So, even if the difficulty doesn't go up any more, miners are probably making less now than they were then.

I'm pretty sure you're wrong about him being a populist. It's not popular to like alts, and he always has. This was a very consistent statement for Antonopoulos to make.
And black and white politics don't really serve anyone. I think the Core developers are amazing and hope they keep doing the great work they do, but I also think bigger blocks is the way to go, so I support Classic too.
I have no animosity toward the Core developers for their programming decisions. They're doing what they think is right. I may hold some animosity for some of the political moves that Core has done, but the big block side isn't innocent in that area either.
My point is that we are all imperfect and thinking you have to oppose something if you support something else is just silly.

You're replying to my example instead of my point. If there were market competition (and demand) we would have faster chips. As it stands, the research money has been going into mobile and energy savings because that's where the money is. Current high end chips are fast enough for most people, usability/portability are more important right now.
And in the high end Intel is pretty much the only game in town. IBM and AMD have both fallen far behind.
If you need more examples of tech that could greatly increase speed look at quantum, analog, light based, biological, etc. It's possible that silicon has neared it's limit but saying we can't keep doubling is just silly. When the demand and competition are there it will happen.

Bitcoin hasn't become a global currency yet. How many businesses in your town accept it? I think it will, but talking to someone like it is might seem a bit pushy.
Just talk about what excites you about it.
I like that it's permissionless like cash, but unlike cash I can send money all around the world.
If it did become a world reserve currency, I believe it would curtail war, because countries would have a much harder time printing money so they can kill.

I did the research and still want bigger blocks. I have friends that have done even more research than me, and they want bigger blocks. I also have friends that support Core's timeline. One of my friends is one of the "evil" (wink) moderators here. And yes, I still consider him a friend.
Since when is this "a panic-invoked change?" It has been talked about for years. Gavin actually had very good timing in mind when he recommended January for the beginning of the size upgrade. The "panic" seems to have mostly come from the Core side of things. Oh, no! The world's going to END if there is a hard fork!!!! 
@_date: 2016-01-22 19:01:08
I agree with most of what you say, but have a different perspective on it.
Segregated Witness looks like it's a much better solution, and I'm all for it. And while you're right that a block size limit increase is an "inelegant, brutish solution" - it's the only solution that can be implemented very quickly.
I believe it would be very dangerous to release the complex code of SegWit onto the blockchain after only a few months of review, and am surprised that the Core developers think it's a good idea. I'm guessing that they want to prove themselves right, and may be increasing the risks to Bitcoin to do so. (I'm not meaning this as an attack. I would probably do this too.) 
And anyone who thinks this isn't an emergent need only needs to talk with people actually working in the Bitcoin economy. I was talking with an ATM owner on Tuesday that was complaining about not having dependable  payouts to customers, and he said other ATM owners that he's talked with are having the same problem. People using ATMs are often new adopters. Are we wanting to alienate them?
@_date: 2016-01-13 02:24:16
This "alternative coins is off topic" thing is bulshit. I recognize that discussing Dogecoin, or Litecoin is off topic. But if you think Bitcoin Classic, or XT have nothing to do with Bitcoin you lack some serious mental capabilities.

If 95% were the standard, one large miner could stop it from happening, which doesn't sound right to me.
@_date: 2016-01-25 02:42:42
luke-jr's 75% is nearly as silly as an absolute number.
If 100 people use Bitcoin and 80 of them run full nodes, I just need 90 nodes to attack that network which would cost a little over $1000. But if there are only 100 people using it why would it have enough value to be worth attacking?
What if 60% of the nodes were in China, and Bitcoin was unilaterally outlawed? Or the Chinese government decided to take those nodes over? It wouldn't matter so much how many nodes there were. (Though, obviously, it would be harder for the government to take over 10,000 nodes than it would 1000.)
So, in my not-so-humble opinion, it's much more important to have diversity in where and who is running nodes than raw numbers. If the Mormons owned 60% of nodes and decided Bitcoin was evil we could have a problem. If a large concentration is in a certain country, economic strata, religion, or geographic area, etc. is when we have a problem. Numbers, eh.

I think I made it quite clear that the "danger" is complex code with little review.

I just don't think a few short months are enough time to do that review for something as important as Bitcoin.

I wasn't necessarily arguing that those specific things would compromise Bitcoin. I honestly don't know enough about computers or cryptography to know what might be a game changer. My point is that there will - at some point - be a game changer and we'll move on to something even better.
@_date: 2016-01-28 08:07:09
Right, but that's not really possible either. Soon we'll have Segregated Witness that's supposed to be the equivalent of 1.75MB blocks, then there will be other improvements like thin blocks.
So fees are supposed to constantly fluctuate based on how fast developers come up with improvements? Then we could get conflicts of interest with developers who are miners, or bribes to hold back development.
I can go on and on with possible negative implications of central planning.
@_date: 2016-03-01 17:05:22
This is bunkis. There is only so much room in a block. Even if everyone upped their fee to 0.1 the blocks would still be full. Obviously the number of transactions would start to decrease because people don't want to pay ~$43 per transaction, but higher fees don't increase capacity.
@_date: 2016-01-25 08:12:24
I didn't just say "cater" I said "cater at all." Maybe you don't give them exactly what they ask for, but it's also a very bad idea to say "let them eat cake!" That's how heads get lopped off. And I never mentioned price, not sure where you're going with that.
@_date: 2016-03-01 18:56:07
What's funny to me is the lack of thinking.
Okay, we assume that this is a spam attack, and just pay some higher fees until the spammers get board or run out of money.
But this doesn't address the problem that the spammers are highlighting.
Sure, maybe we currently have enough capacity for all the "real" transactions, but what about 6-12 months from now? SegWit isn't going to increase capacity quickly enough to cover a doubling of usage. And that's assuming we have SegWit in April and it gets adopted quickly. Even if everyone adopts it within a month, that will only get us another 6-12 months of capacity.

How is raising the block size "shit in the water?" Nearly everyone believes we need bigger blocks, including the Core developers. It's just a matter of when and how to do it that's in question.
And actually it does matter how much shit is in the water. A small enough amount and you don't taste it, and your body is likely equipped to fend off any diseases if it's not overwhelmed.

It's not as much about numbers as it is about them being spread around so it is very hard for a single entity to gain control. People often talk about China having a large percentage of the hash power, which is true, but they have very few nodes.
The numbers are a valid concern, but I'm not worried about it at this point.
I have no idea what luke-jr is talking about. Just what is he measuring? If he's saying that 75% of people using Bitcoin need to run a full node he's full of shit (once again).

It's not "everyone's" computer. It's all the nodes. Just because you have a bitcoin wallet, doesn't mean you have a copy of everyone's transactions.
That being said, yes, it is inefficient, but the inefficiency is part of the security. Because those full recordings of transactions are spread all over the world we don't have to worry about things like war, malicious people/governments, thieves, etc. being able to disrupt the Bitcoin network.

Look at my history. Been around for 2ish years now. I work from home so have a lot of time to read/watch what people have to say. I've come to the conclusion (actually did last summer) that a small one time block limit increase would be best. Allowing other "better" solutions to be developed with some breathing room.
The point is - there are a whole lot of people that feel strongly about their position on what seems like a very important topic, and those people on both sides have gotten a bit irrational. Add a few idiots to the mix and things look real bad.

For the sake of argument let's assume you're right and it's important to limit the block size to increase value.

It's funny to me how often it is true that people in STEM really do ignore everything except the "science." Politics are not a dirty word, it's part of how large groups work things out. Just because "caution" is how things should be done from your perspective does not mean it's the best thing for the entire community.

There will always be people that want fast transactions. If only 25% of minors had a minimum fee it would make everyone that wants a fast transaction pay a fee.
In fact, if only one large pool required a large fee people would pay it. F2Pool just mined 3 out of the last 6 blocks. If I wanted my transaction to confirm quickly and F2Pool had a mandatory fee I'd have to pay that whether they mined the confirming block or not.

This guy is an ass hat. He's chosen a side and anything arguing against his side is completely wrong and has no merit.
He says - referring to a Classic fork - "...with no tangible benefit whatsoever." What complete bullshit. I can totally buy that forking to Classic may be the wrong way to go for several reasons, but saying it has no benefit is just fucking brainless extremism. No wonder a lot people are sick of Core. Listening to this guy is like listening to Westboro Baptist church about how to be a Christian.
The fact is that Segregated Witness is only a few months old and may have security issues. It's a bit scary to me that that much code will be changed and released in such a short time. Major changes like that should take time. Is it a better solution than Classic? Probably. Will it be a better solution in a couple of months? I highly doubt it.

First off, I was talking about monetary central planning, not all central planning. But if you want to argue about how well central planning has worked in environmental situations just look at the history of central planning in Yellowstone National Park for the last 100 years. Or how banning the cutting of Mahogany in many countries has ended up putting the trees in more danger.
Secondly, I didn't say central planning never works, I just believe that if there is a good argument for keeping things free of central influence, that should be tried first.

@_date: 2015-09-17 19:45:53
Folks need to understand that if you put your money in any sort of "bank" you are giving up possession of that money for a "promise" of repayment. Legally you no longer own that money - you own a promise of repayment. This doesn't mean you shouldn't use "banks" just that you should take that risk into account. Are the services/conveniences/interest you might earn from this institution worth the risk you are taking by handing them your money?

Is there no arbitration? Do the bitcoins stay in limbo if both parties don't sign?
@_date: 2015-09-03 18:18:28
But that is what will have to be done if we just leave it as it is. When transactions start not getting processed someone will then need to decide on a new block size. If they double it, fees will surely drop, which will make miners scream. So, what do we do? Taper it at 1% per quarter - trying to keep fees stable? What if the "economy" grows faster/slower than that? Who decides then?
My point is that no one should be using the argument that small block size will help the network because of higher fees. It will hurt the network because it will cause a boom/bust cycle in mining fees, creating hassles for users.

You're right to point out how it's more complicated than the price of bitcoin, but to make it even more complex I'll point out that a lot of the value of a currency comes from the velocity. And if there is 7.5 trillion in assets being passed around and being held on probably no more than 30% of the blockchain that will create a lot of velocity, and thus value.

I do take Satoshi's intent into strong consideration, but I also understand that Bitcoin, as it is today, even with much larger blocks can't be "digital cash" for a large portion of the world.
I believe that we should raise the block size in the very near future, but probably only once. Because I also think that there are better solutions in sidechains, the lightning network, or even other things not yet conceived of. Everything running on THE blockchain would be very inefficient and also, unnecessary. Thinking of it as a "settlement network" is a good idea if you ask me - with one caveat. 
It should never be made difficult to use on blockchain transactions for those who want to.

One big difference is that investment institutions can not invest in bitcoin directly. It doesn't have the proper regulatory structure. So pension funds and many mutual funds can't legally hold bitcoin, but they can buy shares in something like an ETF or a trust.
Another difference is that Mr. Joe Sixpack Day Trader already has an E-trade account, and might just want to dabble in this "new tech" and he won't have to go looking for some way to get some bitcoin, and when he sells the money is still in his E-Trade account and he can go buy more Apple with it right away.

You people are full of shit. If transaction numbers increase, the price must increase. Not necessarily from where it is now, a $10 value might cover the current number of transactions.

I love Bitcoin! Long live freedom!

I would like to suggest FreeGeek.org. They did accept bitcoin, but the guy that help set them up didn't tell anyone else the Coinbase log in info and went on his marry way :P

That's why we now have Bitcoin :) 
You don't have to say it, Bitcoin needs banking now. I know that. But at least we have hope, something to look forward to.

Ha! What happens when this "moment" is over?

It's not a compliance issue because the person goes in a bank and makes a deposit it's the banks responsibility to comply. Or, if they do a transfer then the bank account with info is attached. Bitquick doesn't need to do anything.

So businesses should be forced to do business that they don't want to do?

Don't worry, your dollars are kept safe by the government.

I stand corrected, but my point was that it should be easy to develop software for them. The problem is convincing people to use the software.

I got their survey also, and complained about this problem when they asked if I would recommend them.
No, I haven't had any problems with my account yet, but this stuff makes my skin crawl.

The point is not that Uber is some perfectly free system, but that it is more free and decentralized; and therefore disruptive.

lol, I hate it when that happens.

Wow, a lot of negative here. I've been lending and borrowing on BTCJam since last August. At first I made several bad loans, but kept trying and learned how to do a lot better. In the last 3-4 months my default rate has gone to a very small percentage, and even a couple of those have stayed in communication and say they will eventually pay.
I would argue that most people on there are honest, some just get in hot water, and yes, some are scammers. The problem is that if you loan at an average of 20% APR and 1 out of five default your at zero.
Lending is a challenging business and it's not for everyone, just like playing the stock market, or writing code. Expect some losses and learn from them.

People keep saying the banks need regulation thing. But they only do if they want to be bailed out. Everyone says "if we hadn't had the deregulation in the 90's the 2008 crisis wouldn't have happened." and they may be right, but if we had let the banks fail in 2008, then we wouldn't still be dealing with the shysters.

I'm perfectly happy with where the "moneybags" are putting their money. Infrastructure is good.
Putting dollars into bitcoin just to raise the price is similar to what the Fed is doing to traditional markets, which just creates bubbles with no "real" value.

I realize it's probably not what you're looking for; but doesn't Fiverr do bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-14 02:01:38
Wow, sounds like it's a good time to buy bitcoin then.
@_date: 2015-02-11 23:15:59
Uh, LocalBitcoins has this. Maybe it's not "slick," but it works good. Just did a transaction yesterday.

The current situation doesn't, in my opinion, really cater to a bitcoin run-up. Most everyone in Greece already has Euros and the Euro is considered pretty safe (whether they really are is debatable). They are worried about the banks, not the currency.
As the situation changes motivations may change. Capitol controls might cause people to use bitcoin more because they can get around the controls with it. Or later on if there is a Grexit and they switch to a new currency I could see people maybe choosing bitcoin instead; but I wouldn't get my hopes up on that one.

Whether this is true or not, there are certainly people in our government that believe so. China and Russia made a non dollar trade deal last year and we've been saber rattling at Russia since then; and the CIA encouraged protests in Hong Kong.
