The actual price of a unit is what somebody at that time is willing to pay for the asset. Which is interesting to know.
Market cap is just taking that value and multiplying it by the amount of coins ever mined, many of these coins are lost forever or its holder not interested to sell. So what value does it have to add these coins to the total market cap? These coins will never be sold. In addition, when a mass sell off or buy in occurs price will drop/rise significantly, meaning you will never be able to buy or sell all the circulating supply for the current price.

Market cap doesn' t mean much.

True, however after a month or so the difficulty would adjust and we would be back to normal. Prices may crash in the meanwhile but I’m not sure that it would be ‘the end of bitcoin’. Many people would lose trust but after a month transaction speed would be back to normal and we could technically recover again price wise.

Except the information is bullshit. It's just a bunch of little girls whining about how their toy is better. Please ignore, also the notion that altcoins negatively affect Bitcoin's price because there is a fixed number of coins is just ... lol. Only reason Bitcoin has value is becuase there is a limited amount ... Please go back to economics 101. 
Thanks for expanding your array of accepted cryptocurrencies!

@_date: 2014-08-04 10:53:06
maybe because not everybody cares about having an open phone?

Seems like weird reasoning to be honest.. Currencies are meant to be used / traded. Now you are suggesting that people should just hold on to their funds because of the price of fees.. ?

Yes, damn all these new users driving the price up.

Who decides what is wasteful though? To you it’s wasteful, to me it is not. to me a lot of other things we do in this world seem wasteful that we could stop right now to improve climate. Sadly that’s not how the world works.
