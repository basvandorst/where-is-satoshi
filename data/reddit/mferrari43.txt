Once bitcoin becomes the currency you save your money in, you've truly made the conversion :)
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:58:42
No. I want to accumulate at $5k, we are going down.
@_date: 2019-08-13 22:44:40
connecting to the LNtipbot node now, what do you think? Is funding a channel with .0027 is a decent amount to support routing and tipping on reddit?
@_date: 2018-06-27 15:36:04

Yes it is instant. Transaction propagation is instant. You can send infinite transactions to the network but only the first one mined will go through. If one miner your double spend it will be rejected by every other miner. Is this bitcoin cash level fudding or legitimate newbie questions? It’s hard to tell sometimes
@_date: 2018-04-30 06:45:30
Your transaction propagates to the network instantly and a vender can see from their wallet how likely the transaction is to go through. /thread
@_date: 2018-04-30 07:39:07
�� ok dude 
@_date: 2018-04-30 07:40:45
There is a difference between succesfully “double spend” and attempting to send multiple transactions with the same coins, stop calling multiple transactions “double spending”. You haven’t SPENT. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 07:35:07
I did look. Lol you are the one that doesn’t understand how it works. If double spend is such a huge problem why does it never happen on the network lmao
