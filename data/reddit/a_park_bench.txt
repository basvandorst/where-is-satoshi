Hm. My computer doesn't hibernate/sleep, I've turned that off and I always turn it off each night. However, I'm resyncing and hopefully that will fix it. When I checked the details of the smaller transaction, I was sending from about 8 different addresses, and I'm unsure how many BTC should be on each one, so checking with blockchain wouldn't help me much.
@_date: 2014-02-09 21:05:15
It's close, but not quite right. That applies to if only 0 or 1 peers had seen it. My "peers that have seen it" keeps going up, up to 9 and 8 now.

I was using Bitcoin-QT at first, but that was using 10+ GB for the blockchain history. The best alternative I found was MultiBit, but I hadn't actually tried really doing anything with it besides checking my balance since I got it.

I resync'd MultiBit a couple times. It cleared the transactions, but before I had 0.115 BTC and I was spending 0.11 of it, I now only have 0.07. I've basically lost the equivalent of $40 and I have no idea where it went. Not a single transaction changed in my transaction list (other than the 2 that weren't going through disappearing), there's no indication of any of my addresses losing the money on blockchain. The money just disappeared. Fantastic.
While I believe that Bitcoin will have a very strong presence in the future, I'm going to transfer what I have into an Amazon gift card and maybe I'll rejoin the movement in a couple years when issues like this are no longer a problem. The one time I've gone to actually spend my Bitcoins has left a very sour taste in my mouth about the current state of the situation.

Afraid not. Whenever I clicked "show on blockchain.info" the site came up with "No such transaction exists."
I did eventually get it to work so I could buy gift cards, but in the process (re-syncing MultiBit) it managed to somehow lose ~$40 worth of Bitcoin. I had enough to get $50 and $25 Amazon giftcards, while having enough for another $10-15 worth left over. After re-syncing, no transactions changed in my history, but it lost ~0.04 BTC, so I could only get $25 and $20 gift cards, with less than a $10 gift card's worth (even with the ~$1 in points on Gyft).

I meant Havelock Investments and ThickAsThieves. I know about ASICMINER, I simply haven't been able to afford their shares before. However, I sent 0.07 over to Havelock, waiting for that to go through and I'll buy a couple shares of this passthrough and see what's going on.

No need to. In Morgneer's case, all he has to do is sell enough to earn back his $250. Then, even if he sells them later on at less than $10/BTC, he still made a profit.

Well, I resync'd Multibit and it showed the same thing. Sent the balance from QT to the Multibit-given address, which of course cost .001 BTC transaction fee, plus .00005 BTC because it was "over the size limit", whatever that means. Basically 87 cents to send myself money :p
Now, QT shows Balance as 0.00005 BTC, Multibit shows a balance of 0.0698 (which looks about right without whipping out a calculator) but shows "Spendable 0.00007"

Is most of the money made from buying or mining? Im starting to get into mining (current rates would have me spending an extra $40 on electricity but making $240 each month), wondering if its worth it to reinvest some of that into an ASIC miner.

Buy 25 BTC at $10 each = $250 spent
BTC goes up to $200 each.
Sell 1.25 BTC = $250 back in his pocket.
He is now at $0 spent, but he still has 23.75 BTC. Even if BTC crashed a huge amount and he sold the rest at $1 each, he'd still make $23.75 profit.
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:27:09
The way I got my private keys was through the QT client, I did a dumpprivkey for each address. I'm resyncing the Multibit wallet, maybe that'll help.

At the same time, if they did that the value of bitcoin relative to other currencies would likely plummet, making all the bitcoins and ASIC hardware they're holding useless.
Also, ASICMiner probably could hit 50+% of network hashrate, but they actively sell off hardware to make sure they don't get there. That's reason enough for me to trust them (also the part where I've got like $18 invested)
@_date: 2013-09-15 18:32:16

I agree. Just one of those things where I didn't have the money to be an early adopter and end up kicking myself for it. At the same time, even if I did have the money at the time, with this long of a delay, I probably would have tried to sell my pre-order.

A couple reasons. I still haven't found a way to send coins without transaction fees (even with my transaction fees set to 0 in the options). Also, in case I get any coins on other addresses, they'll automatically be moved to MultiBit's client instead of having to keep the ridiculously large QT installed (currently 13GB on my PC)

Yes, there could be. It could also continue to rise due to increased demand. Passthroughs just started a couple weeks ago, Bitcoin is still increasing in popularity, etc.
However, I said prices are "likely" to go up, not that it's 100%. I believe that the increased popularity of BTC and the recent passthroughs for ASICMINER will contribute to a higher price per share.
