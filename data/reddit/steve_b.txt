Not true at all.  Exchange volume vs price is a much better measure.  I could mint some shitty altcoin with 1 billion coins premined, then get someone to buy it for $0.01.  it now has a "market cap" of $10 million, but good luck finding other buyers for it.
If the buy depth is too shallow, the price will plummet on a coin if you try to sell too much, regardless of the number in "circulation."

Exactly this.  Back in 1995, when I first got a well-paying job, I bought my first new car for $35K.  Not a crazy high price, but well above the average car price and in the ”luxury” segment.
Even though I could easily afford it, I remember stressing out about it all the time - scratches, parking dings.  Then an asshole neighbor vandalized it by pouring paint thinner on the hood because I had (legally) parked it across the street from his house.  I can only imagine how freaked out I would have been if it had been a supercar.

This usually means a second mortgage.  When you are paying off a mortgage, it is usually not for the full value of the house, either because you originally purchased it with a large down payment, or because the real estate market has improved.  Banks will let you take out a second loan (or a line of credit) secured by this difference, although not usually for the entire difference.
The risk, of course, is that the market turns and now your house is worth less than the total still owned on the loans.  This is called being "under water" and it means you'd have to pay the remainder out of your pocket should you sell the house (or be foreclosed upon if you can't make the loan payments).
Don't do this.

Man, I'm so sorry to let you down.  I had no physical evidence other than his after-the-fact backhanded admission (when I was going door to door on the street after it happened, which was no more than 45 minutes after the crime), he was the only one who answered the door, and the first words out of his mouth were, "well, you shouldn't be parking there."  Unfortunately, that wouldn't be enough to stand up in court.

No, but for the Swiss automatics (aka self-winding watches), you do have to bring them in for maintenance every 5 or 10 years, which will cost you $100 or more.  Like any other collectable, almost all of them, regardless of brand, will lose value over time and cost you money to boot.  They're like a much less expensive yacht.
But you own one because it's just cool to have such a needlessly complicated piece of machinery on your arm, not for investment or accuracy (a humble $40 quartz movement will keep better time and be slimmer profile than the most expensive automatic money can buy).  I have mine as a souvenir of my time in Europe, and to entertain the fantasy that in the post-apocalyptic wasteland, I still be able to tell time without batteries or winding, at least until it needs cleaning again.

Is that a loss based just on electricity, or with amortized cost of hardware factored in?  If it's the latter but not the former, then there's certainly no need to shut off equipment you've already purchased, and the steady rise we're seeing could be nothing more than hardware ordered months ago finally arriving &amp; being turned on.   Also, I assume that a number (if not most) of the Chinese miners are running with free electricity due to bribes paid to officials of the local utility companies.

I don't understand this sentence:


If miners are anticipating a bull run, why would they throw more hardware to mine coins against an increasing difficulty curve?  Wouldn't it be safer to just buy the coins?
I guess the missing information for me is how much it's costing to mine based on hardware, electricity and difficulty compared to just buying.  Back when I was mining, mining hardware was advancing so quickly that it didn't make sense to buy hardware now in anticipation of it being useful a year from now, since by then you'd be pretty far behind on the hash/watt race.  Maybe the arms race of mining hardware has slowed down now, and is more a factor of quantity over quality.

The mortgage deduction serves to lower your effective interest rate based on your marginal tax rate.  For someone in a 20% tax bracket, that means their 4.5% loan is really a 3.6% loan.  Considering how low interest rates are now, and how very safe investments are going to return much more, it doesn't make sense to pay off principal early, unless you're the kind of person who suffers emotional distress from the knowledge that you owe someone money.
Better to put the difference into a tax-deferred investment, or even an after tax investment (capital gains tax is still less than the 20% income tax).

I don't understand your coffee cup analogy.  If today you acquired 1 mBTC for $0.50, and a year from now if 1 mBTC = $3 and you used it to buy a coffee, of course you've incurred gains.  Assuming you didn't incur other losses, you're wealthier now &amp; you pay taxes on it.
From what I read (and I could be wrong) if it were classified as a currency, you wouldn't pay tax at the point of sale, but holding the currency over a tax period would require you to report the gains as well - only now it counts as simple income, not capital gains.  I don't know what the tax liabilities are with exchange rate gains incurred within a single tax period, but I'm sure they must exist as well.
You may not like the fact that you're taxed this way, but it's consistent with the way all other gains are taxed - you get wealthier, you pay some of that back in tax.

The network effect of merchant acceptance and financial services built on top of Bitcoin is far more important than the network effect of a a bunch of feel-good messages on a messageboard service that exists mainly as a timewaster.
Reddit buzz isn't an example of the network effect.  NE is all about technology buy-in, and how difficult it will be to move to something else.  Is it really surprising that an alt-coin built around the idea of a joke has gained more traction than BTC among among the users of a meme- and circlejerk-friendly place like reddit?
As a BTC user, I really don't give two shits about how popular or friendly is; it's not the center of the BTC universe - it's not even one of the significant domains of discussion or knowledge sharing about BTC.  I subscribe here mainly to be notified of anything major going on re: BTC, and to very rarely comment or clarify (hopefully) something.  I'm not here to be amused.
Will that matter in the long run?  I guess we'll see whether the feel-good, party-people silliness vibe of DC or the lets-get-shit-done vibe of BTC is ultimately the more effective way of driving adoption of a cryptocurrency.

Options are not property until they're exercised, at which point they're taxed in fiat.  I don't see how it's "unfair" that miners (that includes me) would have to pay tax on what is acquired wealth - which is exactly what mined BTC is.  The simplest way for miners to deal with this is to simply convert the taxable portion of their mined coins periodically (I'm guessing quarterly would be sufficient, since that's how often self-employed individuals are required to make sure they're up to date tax-wise); the amount converted would be the fraction corresponding to their marginal tax rate.

I hope you kept enough coins to pay off the cap gains on that $200K.
Your story doesn't really add up, though.  Why would you take what would have been your mortgage payments going forward and buy BTC with it?  If you think that BTC is going to appreciate faster than the interest rate of your former mortgage, why didn't you just leave your money in BTC and continue to pay off the loan?  Doing otherwise just means you'll wins up with less BTC at the end of the loan. 
And if you think BTC is growing slitter l slower than your interest rate, why are you putting your money back into it?  There are plenty of safe investments it there that yield significantly more than 4%.

I realize I'm late to the party, but I still don't understand the massive butthurt from people regarding this decision.  What would have been the alternative?
Regardless of whether bitcoin was classified as an asset or as currency, it would still have to be taxed as income upon receipt, either from mining or trade.  And if it were classified as currency, as I understand it, each year you would have to pay tax on any gains made due to exchange rate fluctuations,, and that tax is based off the simple income rate, not the capital gains rate.  So you'd be forced to liquidate a little of your bitcoin holdings every year as the value increased in order to cover your tax liability.  I'd much rather pay the lower cap gains tax at the time I converted to fiat than be forced to reduce my holdings each year to account for volatility.
I suppose I'm indifferent on this ruling because I've always seen BTC as a store of wealth, not a daily transactional currency, but really, the system already exists in its entirety on a computer network - it's really not that hard to record spot trading prices at the time of every transaction and hold onto it in a ledger.  If you're doing business in a foreign currency, I'd imagine you need to record some similar.
The decision can always be amended down the road if the volume of BTC traffic makes this tracking impractical (for the IRS, of course - who cares about us), but for now, BTC really is a wealth store/investment vehicle - just one that happens to be highly liquid.

Here's what I don't understand:


I stopped mining back in Nov 2012 when GPU mining stopped being profitable, so maybe I don't understand current economics, but why do you have to be in the the largest pool?  Surely the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th largest pools will be paying out frequently enough that it doesn't matter when it comes to variance.
I was using slush's pool back then, and the pool was large enough to be paying out several times per day, if I recall; at worst, maybe once/day; the point was, between difficulty cycles, you were getting dozens of payouts - enough to reduce variance.
Variance is a function of difficulty (which changes every two weeks), and the pool's percentage of the network hashrate.  A pool with "only" 3% (like slush's) of the network hashrate at the beginning of difficulty cycle is going bring in about 4 block rewards per day; if the network hashrate increases 10% during that time, and the pool's does not change (which isn't really the case, as even the smaller pools are larger all the time), that would drop to 3.5 by the end of the cycle.  Over the whole cycle, that pool will burp out about 50 or so block rewards - more than enough to smooth out any variance due to luck.  In reality, slush's pool produces about 6 per day.
So why do you have to be in the absolute largest?  90 block rewards over a difficulty interval is more than enough to produce a predictable payout.  1500 (a payout of every 15 mins) gives you not much more certainty.

That's not true of all investments.  Yes, for something like fine art, or gold or BTC, buying low and selling high is just wealth transfer.  But for stock investing, at least when taken in total, investing is you giving money to others to do something that increases the overall wealth of society.  Of course, individual stocks may outperform relative to the actual wealth they provide, but in general, banking and investment serve as engines that allow people to launch productive ventures.  The return you get as an investor is the reward you get for participating in the risk of launching these ventures.

The government's power to grant and enforce patents is laid out explicitly in the Constitution, so "by definition" it is, in fact, legal.  If you mean morally or ethically wrong, well, I'm not sure how anything can be wrong in that way by definition.
I'll grant that the current patent system is in need of repair.  Business process and software patents have to go; there needs to be some correlation between the amount of time it takes derive the idea (and an inverse relationship to the time it takes to produce the object once the idea has been developed) and the period of time the allotted to exclusivity by the patent holder.
But I don't see how a market-based information/innovation economy can function without patents and copyright.  What's the incentive for someone to invest years or millions into developing a product that can be cheaply reproduced by anyone once the research is completed?  Public funding of this kind of research works up to a point, but there is too much innovation &amp; creative work produced privately to cover it all, unless you envision a communist utopia.

Assuming you had them over a year, if you live in the u.s., just pay the long term capital gains tax and be done with it.  For individuals making less than $418,400, it's only 15%.  Assuming you already had a job and we're making around $100k, you'd pay $179,080 to completely cash out $1M, assuming a cost basis of $0 (long term hodler).  It would be even less if you made no regular income, or if your cost basis was higher, it would be even less.
IMO, it's not worth the hassle and possible legal troubles to shave a bit off.  85% of a fortune is still a fortune, and it's free money you would never have had anyway if the government hadn't existed (to create stuff like the internet, regulated power grids, etc., regardless of how imperfect these institutions actually are).

Probably a lot more than 100 :).  But I believe the ratio of successful to failed businesses is probably in the 1:3 range; I recall hearing many times that 60% of restaurants fail within the first three years, and they're probably on the bad end of things.
But I don't really understand your "emotional grounds" argument.  Investment is fundamentally about someone with free capital giving it to someone who requires extra capital in order to overcome the startup costs of an enterprise, whether this is done via the stock market, a bank loan, or any other transfer.  Feeling good about it has nothing to do with it.  And, in general, the investor will make money if the company succeeds, and, in general, the company will succeed if it provides something of lasting value, that generally improves the lives of folks (e.g., someone opens a flour mill to more efficiently mill grain, so everyone else can spend less time milling grain themselves, economy of scale, blah blah blah).
The stock market allows the investor to exit this arrangement earlier by passing their burden onto a new buyer, presumably for more than what they put in, because now the likelihood that the business will succeed is more obvious; and so on up (or down) the ladder.
Obviously, being lucky comes into account when you have an enterprise the perception they will succeed becomes extremely large, such that they are valued way above their fundamentals (e.g., Tesla, Uber, etc.), and in that case, you're "lucky" because you picked them, but in other cases, it's just a question of investing (and providing capital to) enterprises that are just good at doing stuff (e.g. 3M).
@_date: 2019-06-26 15:36:25
Yeah, we're pretty much in agreement; just to clarify, when I talk about the overall wealth of society, I don't mean for some noble cause, but simply that investment, for the most part, is not a zero-sum game.  You put in X, you get out 2X, but that's not because someone, somewhere else has necessarily lost X; the venture you funded is now doing something more efficiently than the way it was done before, so the overall wealth of society increases (and probably, your percentage share of that wealth increases a little faster than everyone else's).  The societal wealth increase is a side effect, not the main reason for investing.  If it wasn't for this, then the standard of living we're enjoying today would have to be coming at the expense of a tremendous decline in most everyone else's.  Although you can make the case that wealth disparity is a big problem today, both locally and globally, it can't be denied that the overall wealth of society (measured in health, comfort, leisure, education level, life expectancy, etc.) is at least hundreds of times greater now than it was 500 years ago.

Bitcoin seems like a good fit for this, in terms of not having a middleman to leach your payments.  But at $5/BTC, .1BTC for 10 minutes work comes out to about $3/hour - pretty lousy wages for the U.S.  However, as a means of giving work to desperately poor people in developing nations in exchange to tasks that need doing, it seems like a good idea (I'm assuming internet cafe rates in places like that are way, way below $3/hour).
Only problem I see: the best fit for tasks like this are one that are hard for a computer to perform, but easy for it to verify.  Most of these tasks (flagging inappropriate content) seem unverifiable, so the only way a company could make it work would be for a single task to be done by many workers, and take the consensus or majority opinion as "correct", which of course raises the wage to some multiple of $3/hour, at some point approaching what you could just pay a regular employee, properly supervised, to do.
What I'm waiting to see:  A system that can transform tasks like these into an equivalent task with a different front end, such that the worker doesn't see exactly what they're doing, but the work they do ends up them solving problems/puzzles in a game, possibly Farmville-like, or something like that, which people will gladly play for free (or even pay to play).  At that point, you've got the best of both worlds - people playing a free game (or even being paid a little to do so), and the client getting their computationally tricky work done.

[Disadvantages of the gold standard](
The key one is this: 


As for being an argument against Bitcoin, yes, it also applies.  However, I don't see Bitcoin as ever being a replacement for national currencies.  I do see it ultimately as a useful exchange currency or commodity, though, in the same way that gold is today.
Most individuals who own gold own it as shares, not as physical lumps sitting in a safe somewhere; the problem, as we all know, is that those shares aren't useful as a currency - no good way of exchanging them on a day-to-day basis.  I see BTC as ultimately being a good way for people to have a commodity that they can use to hold onto wealth that is both convenient for regular commerce, but not subject to the fluctuations that affect national currencies or real-world commodities.

The current price of gold is far greater ([10x? 20x?]( than its industrial value, and I don't think the price is driven by its jewelry value, either (shiny, yellow, noncorroding alloys are cheap and plentiful)
The only real reason gold has the value it has today is scarcity and tradition.  It's really the same as Bitcoin+time.  Granted, time and tradition are powerful forces.  Btc may never significantly make a dent in the hold-of-value business, but its other advantages may eventually be compelling enough.

Some general problems with this list, mainly having to do with exchange rates.


Savings accounts today don't (if you get the right one) charge you to "hold your money" - they just reduce the amount of interest paid on the account for their charge.  Since there are no interest-bearing BTC accounts yet, you're actually worse off "saving" your wealth in BTC, as you gain no interest; of course, if you think that the long term value of BTC against the $ is going to rise, then that's your "interest".






Since BTC has an unstable exchange rate between BTC &amp; $, it is not a good choice for settling minor debts "to the penny"; within hours after you pay your friend, the $ value of the payment will have changed.  Of course, if you all agree to play poker using BTC as stakes, that's a different story.


The carbon footprint for mining BTC is non-zero.
Of course, all these disadvantages are present-day ones.  If BTC gets adopted widely enough, then paying for everyday things with BTC becomes practical.

I think something the Bitcoin defenders are overlooking is that the reason the exchange rate matters is because right now everything you would want to buy with BTC is available in dollars, euros, whatever.  
I get paid in dollars, and everything I buy is in dollars.  If the dollar moves dramatically against the Japanese yen, it doesn't affect how much I'm paying for food or gas on a day-to-day basis.  Right now the bitcoin economy isn't large enough for someone to live their lives inside it - you have to keep coming back up for air into the other currencies, and when you do, you find your wealth has significantly decreased.
I'll be happy just to see BTC at a stable value, even if it's 1/10th what the current rate is.

Right now my rig burns 400W, and generates about 10 BTC/month.  400W is 300kWh, which comes to $47, so I'm above water as long as 1 BTC &gt; $4.70.  So mining is still profitable, if I chose to sell my coins as I mined them.
If you think bitcoins are worth buying now at $10, you must think they're going to go up; if so, mining them at $4.70 is an even greater deal.  I've paid $700 for my mining rig, so that gets removed from the profit at the end.  
I'm not in this to pay for a $700 machine - I'm hoping that BTC goes up in value significantly down the road.  If it doesn't, I'm out $700 - as far as investments go, that's hardly anything in terms of risk.  Presumably BTC will not drop below $4.70 in the long run, so my electricity is paid for; if it does drop below $4.70, then the people buying BTC at $10 right now are the ones who are really taking the risk.

The mining algorithm is such that the number of bitcoins produced is constant, regardless of computing power.  What do you think is the source of the increase in supply?
My guess would be the people who set up commercial mining operations with server farms are now the overwhelming majority of coins mined.  Even though the number of coined mined per day is constant, the percentage of those coins that are being immediately sold is much greater.

Better to compare Bitcoin to gold.  As non-inflationary currency, BTC will likely never be a [unit of account]( but it does match the use cases of gold when it comes to investment.
A price of around $30,000/BTC puts the 21 million coins equal to about 10% of the world's gold supply at current prices for both.
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:50:25
I see it as its weakness.  The small daily volume of BTC means its price can be manipulated by someone with enough capital (how much?  I'm not sure, but I would guess less than $50 million).
The price curve over the last two years seems too regular (punctuated with bubble/crash spikes) to be natural.  My tinfoil theory is that the parties of concern (Chinese miners?  some investment cartel?) slowly buys or mines BTC, then occasionally will start to put price pressure on the exchanges to fuel a bubble.  After they cash out &amp; wait for the crash, they resume the slow acquisition again.

Coinbase has worked fine for me - I set up an account there 4 years ago and I use it to sell &amp; buy coins.  The thing to keep in mind with them is that their customer service is pretty much nonexistent.  I've never received any response from them for the times there's been something irregular going on with my transactions.  Fortunately, the problems always sort themselves out after a week, which seems to be a pretty common beef about them.
But I don't keep any dollar or BTC balance in their accounts.  I have my own wallet that holds my coins, and a bank account to hold dollars I generate from BTC (and I use it for nothing else).  When I want to sell BTC, I transfer them from my wallet to coinbase, then immediately sell them, which transfers the money to my bank account.  Buying BTC is the reverse.
The point is, I don't leave balances in any online entity that I don't have control over.  As has been repeated here many times, if you aren't the sole holder of the private keys to your address, you don't really own the coins.

Sure, go ahead and buy some, but do it for a long hold; 3 years at least.  If you believe in looking at charts, take a look at the price charts for the last two years.  You'll see a steady, nonlinear growth curve that's punctuated by bubbles and crashes, but the general long-term trend is remarkably consistent.
According to that curve, it looks like the price right now should be around $1500, and the growth rate in the last month or two matches historical bubble rates, but even if it does crash, it feels like you're going to recover in a year or so.
This is all purely speculative bullshit, but there isn't a lot more you can base prices on for BTC, so perhaps it'sgood enough. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:28:55
I'm a super-long-term holder, so the current price feels high to me.  This last week I sold a small portion of my holdings to lock in some gains, and I feel like the long-term price of Bitcoin is higher than the current price but that there will probably be a big correction to the current price as well.
You can wait for a crash, but it may never happen.  You can buy some today, and the crash could happen the next day.  It's pretty much impossible to tell (unless you're the entity orchestrating the current bubble, if one exists).  But if you plan on holding for the long term (as a retirement asset, 10+years), then putting a small portion (say, 5%) of your portfolio into BTC seems like a reasonable high-risk investment.  If it completely crashes, you're down 5% overall; if it goes up 5x, you've now added 25% to your nest egg, which is more than respectable.
The oft-repeated "invest only what you're prepared to lose" adage would apply right now, IMO.  Not all investments should be "stuff you're prepared to lose", but BTC is potentially high-return, high risk.  Diversify.
EDIT:  Also, just buy your own coins &amp; put them in a cold wallet; don't waste time with "Bitcoin IRAs" or using online services to hold your investment.  The safest thing you can probably do is just create a paper wallet &amp; stick the information in a safe deposit box somewhere.

Ask a lawyer you trust.
There are plenty of professions where it's possible to determine competence a priori, based on their past performance; most professions, really (although it's true that it's much harder to predict the success of a large project, even with a strong team).  That's not the same as being able to find a competent person if you're not familiar with their history.  We can safely say that Spielberg and the Coen Brothers are good at making films, or that Toyota is good at making cars.  It doesn't mean that every single film or car they produce will be perfect, but you can have a high level of confidence in the product.
Financial services are always providing the "past performance not indicative of future performance" caveat because they know ultimately there are too many variables they can't control (unless they're extremely conservative, low-yield investments).  You could just as easily point to the one player in a thousand who walked away from the roulette table and say he was good at playing roulette.

Sure, trading with sufficient volume is one way to manipulate a market.  I'm not making a value judgement, but just aware of the fact that the price is not always a result of "natural" demand (e.g., demand arising from higher utilization of the commodity), as opposed to speculative enthusiasm and FOMO.  The former would lead price stability in the long run, the latter to bubbles &amp; crashes.

People are geniuses when it comes to rationalizing patterns observed in the past, and with so many people participating in the casino of financial services it is inevitable that a few will generate more money, for longer stretches, even if they all follow the exact same random strategy.  The same cannot be said for observing how someone performs a task with many dimensions of success &amp; failure.

So, how exactly is bitcoin good at supporting micropayments.  As far a I can tell, the only advantage it has over credit cards or other systems is the same advantage it has in any other transaction - reduction of the fee.
But you still use it the same way - you'd have to set up an account with the site in question, send them a large chunk of money, and then have that account reduced by some tiny amount per service use.  No different from using a credit card.
As far as I know, you can't just spontaneously have micropayments go from your wallet to whatever website you use (that accepts BTC micropayments), unless it involves setting up some kind of browser extension, which is a bit of hassle, I imagine; but even then, googling around a bit tells me that it's not really practical to send many tiny amounts in BTC (otherwise you end up with "dust" in your wallet) - so some form of grouping of charges would still be necessary.
I'm sure all these have their solutions, but it seems that the you can't get away from the fact that a website would have to:
1.  Set up all the BTC micropayment infrastructure in the first place
2.  Hope that customers visiting there had BTC to spend
3.  Hope that those customers went through the process of setting up a micropayment-enabled scheme on their browser

Here's a simple HODLing strategy to avoid being too cautious or too reckless.  When you feel that itch that tells you it's "too good to be true", just sell half your position, and keep the other half until the price is now 4x (or 10x, or some other "big jump" by your definition), at which point you repeat the process.
Only ever sell half (or a third, or some "big fraction"), and do so when you'll be made whole and then some by the trade.  If the price ends up dropping later on, take 1/4 of the proceeds you got on your big sale &amp; buy some back.
You'll always be ahead after that first sale, and if it never goes up again, you'll still have that stack of cash.  If it does go up, you'll have another stack.
The maxim here (which I coined, although maybe someone did independently) is "Half a fortune is still a fortune."  If you're overjoyed to get a windfall of "X", you're likely going to still be plenty pleased to get a windfall of "X/2".

Who knows, maybe he'll turn out to be right.  But it's a stupid prediction to make, since he'll never know he was right - even on his deathbed, if BTC is limping along at $3, he won't know what happens yet.  I guess there's a chance that BTC could fail in a way that guarantees there's no way it could recover - some sort of hack relating to the integrity of the blockchain, or something - but that seems extremely unlikely given how long it's been around, and how small &amp; public the codebase is.

If you never sell, you never profit.  You have to realize gains at some point.
One strategy for profiting is to only sell a fraction of your holdings after a threshold is crossed.  For example, sell 10% of your current stake once the price increases 2x from your last sale.  After 3 such sales, you'll have covered your original basis, and still have over 73% of your original holdings.

I stopped GPU mining back in December, when the electricity costs for my dual 6970s had exceeded the value in BTC generated (this was after the block reward was halved).
It was only the big bump in price that made mining profitable for GPUs for a few months; I didn't bother mining again, because although the price made it profitable on paper, the difficulty was already high enough that I'd only be adding to my existing BTC holdings in extremely small amounts.
So now we're basically back to Dec 2012, as far as GPU mining goes, and we'll likely never go back.  Time to find something else to heat your basements or dorm rooms.

It depends on:
1.  How much you have invested
2.  Perceived long-term prospects
3.  Volatility of commodity
If the amount you have invested is a small portion of your portfolio, you feel that the long-term prospects are at least "it won't completely disappear" and the volatility is high, there's no point in freaking out and trying to "jump out" at the right time.
So your $5000 investment has dropped to $500 in one day - do you really give a shit at this point of getting out at $500 vs getting out at $100?  You're already down $4500; is being down $4750 that much worse?  At some point, there's no value in cashing out to cut your losses if the difference between "price now" and 0 is only 5% greater loss, particularly if it's so volatile.
This is a crash only to day traders; to anyone with with a long-term hold strategy, this only means the price is back to where it was one month ago.  Big deal.

The difference between just leaving your computers on and mining can be pretty significant - and most machines that are useful for mining will use a ton of electricity even when idle.
My dual 6970 mining rig (now decommissioned) would draw about 200 watts idle, and 500 watts under load.  That's a $30 difference per month.  I've been tempted to start mining again, with the price so high, but I was never mining with the intent of immediately selling, so I don't feel like I should be letting current prices affect my decision to mine (I'm holding for the long term).  I sold enough BTC when it was $40 to pay for the electricity and hardware costs, so I'm free &amp; clear now.

What I wonder about:  If you were to wave your magic wand and have all credit card transactions replace by bitcoin-based system, how much cheaper would goods be (or how much more profit would vendors net)?
It would likely be greater than zero, but not equal to the transaction fees paid today, as a bitcoin-based system would need to have other safeguards in place that current credit card systems provide.  As a consumer, you'd need some kind of "purchase insurance" that would take the place of the dispute resolution service provided today (as well as extended warranties offered by some cards).
Of course, you'd have the option to not carry it at all (I've never needed to use my credit card to reverse a charge for poor goods or services), but I'm guessing that without the threat of losing access to a payment channel (credit cards), a number of vendors would be less scrupulous than they are today.  So the likelihood that consumers would get burned by vendors would go up, albeit probably not much, and certainly hopefully less than the rate in the form of transaction fees.
Bitcoin is a libertarian construction, and as such puts more burdens on individuals when it comes to protections - there are no a-priori regulations in place enforced by a third party.  Everything becomes contract enforcement.  Libertarians have traditionally touted this kind of economic environment as superior, but there hasn't been a way to really put it into practice.  Bitcoin will likely be the lab for this stuff.

Your comment reflects the problem I see with forums like this; people get so caught up in the boosterism of Bitcoin that they fail to engage in what could be a meaningful/fruitful discussion.
I don't see pb1x's original comment as slamming bitcoin or calling the OP an idiot, but instead as a springboard to a discussion on how people like us with BTC can spread the idea to those who aren't familiar.  I don't see what the OP did as being particularly effective.
Just spamming people with bitcoins (in this cumbersome process, with paper &amp; urls, etc), isn't going to really light a fire under the recipient to go out &amp; learn about it - they're probably just going to toss it in the trash in the same way they would someone who left a cute cartoon as a tip; they'll go along with it to be social, but it's really too much hassle to expect the average someone go figure out the frankly confusing world of working with Bitcoins to redeem about $6.
Instead, we should be figuring out what we can do to make it easier for n00bs to just use the stuff.  The amount of effort they need to go through needs to be commensurate to the reward.  Here's one idea:
A tinyurl-like address (or QR code) you can generate that resolves to an account you create on a BTC-enabled ecommerce site that contains a balance of BTC that you tip.  The recipient of the tip can just visit the link, and they will be logged in with the amount in their account, which they can use to buy whatever is on that site, or they could transfer the money elsewhere.  Of course, this is not secure - someone could try to guess the site and steal the coins before the recipient secured them elsewhere, but it's a starting point for an idea.
It's essentially the equivalent of a gift card, only it can be turned back into cash.  A commerce site that supported this kind of operation could have the account age out, so that if it wasn't claimed within a certain time (1 year), the money in the account would just go to the site (as opposed to being lost forever, like this tip would be); it would give some incentive to the site to implement the logic for this feature.

Why the hostility?  You didn't read past my second sentence, did you?  I wrote it poorly - I meant to say, "Bitmit's escrow looks like it works by having the parties involved prove that they're in the right ..."  The rest of my post makes sense.
I also make no claim to say whether escrow "works" - it obviously does, for a wide variety of transactions.  I just don't really understand how it works in the online realm (including eBay).  Can you explain what happens in an escrow situation when a buyer says they didn't receive the item, but in fact has (trying to defraud the seller)?  We have packages dropped off almost daily and never sign for any of them, so delivery confirmation isn't guaranteed.  Plus, what if the buyer says, "Seller shipped me an empty box."?
Now, a sufficiently complex escrow scheme, for extremely valuable transactions (like real estate) can be created, but this is too burdensome for use every time you want to buy something online.  But when I buy online, I want to know I'm not going to get ripped off, even if I'm only paying $10, and so far, in my 15 year history of online purchasing with credit cards, I've never been screwed.
Maybe I worry overmuch.  In those 15 years, I've only had to resort to dispute resolution maybe 4 times, for &lt; $100 each time, and one other time when someone managed to use my credit card number to wire $1000 to the Philippines (which could not happen with BTC).

I think the easiest way to think about it is as a virtual commodity, not a virtual currency.  It's finite, can only be held by one party at a time.  There have been arguments regarding its utility outside a medium of exchange, but I think the fact that it can be electronically held &amp; transferred with no central authority (and thus behaves like a material object) is its own utility.  Maybe that's enough.
I didn't finish my thought.  As a commodity, it's not really a replacement for existing currencies, so the deflationary aspects of it don't concern me, just as the deflationary aspects of gold are not a concern either.  Similarly, it's not going to change the world in terms of undermining the power of central banks to regulate overall economic growth.  Fiat currencies will continue, but BTC will emerge as another way to store wealth like metals.

So credit card purchasing is dramatically different in the UK from the US, I guess.
In the US, I don't believe the minimum fee per purchase is very high - certainly not 25% of the price of a half gallon of milk.  But also, you'd *almost* never get charged extra for using a credit card (exceptions include some very few gas stations, which offer a discounted per-gallon rate on gas for cash purchases).
So here, the maxim is "Always pay with a credit card, if possible", since by doing so, you will accumulate cash back bonuses (1% - 6%, depending on the card &amp; type of purchase).  Obviously, this cost is being borne by the merchant, but if you pay for cash, you're essentially just funding the cashback bonuses for those paying with a credit card.

You say that a savings-based economy has lots of money to invest, but why would someone holding deflationary money invest in anything that didn't have a good chance of exceeding the deflation rate of the money itself?
I don't see how this wouldn't make things harder for entrepreneurs across the board.  It is difficult enough right now for someone wanting to start a business to get financing for their idea from banks; a deflationary currency just makes it something like N * 1/M more difficult, where N &amp; M are the inflationary rates of dollars plus the deflationary rate of the new currency, respectively (expressed like 1.04 for 4% inflation and .98 for 2% deflation).
If the economy were growing overall, like the author says, that would discourage cash-holders from giving their wealth to others trying to kick-start their businesses to participate in the growth.  It seems like another example of the first mover problem - the ones who already are already growing continue to grow and get richer, and the others get screwed.

I've said it elsewhere, but I'll repeat it here.
Half a fortune is still a fortune.
If you have what you consider to be an absurd amount of money right now, sell half of it, for the reasons above.  If you feel like converting to fiat money makes you some kind of sellout, turn around and turn that into gold, or some other relatively stable commodity.

Not really.   If bitcoin is classified as a currency, you would be taxed on its rise in value over one year, even if you did nothing but horde it, and I believe you would be taxed at the marginal rate if normal income.
If it is classified as a store of value (e.g. gold), you would only be taxed in the year you cashed out, and then at different rates depending on if you held it for less than a year or more. 
As far as I know, the IRS hasn't weighed in on what it is.  The safest is probably to treat it as currency, but you'll pay the most tax that way.

If you're apprehensive about giving access to your bank account to mostly anonymous online entities (as you should be), just open up a bank account that you use only for staging transactions.  I assume that in the UK the price for opening (and keeping open) a bank account is zero or close to it, as it is in the U.S. (if you use the right bank).
Just deposit money into it from your real account when you need to buy, and pull the money out after you've sold.  With the bank I use, the direct transfer feature will not work if there are insufficient funds - it's not like writing a check, where they will allow the transfer and hit you with an overdraft charge on top of it.

There's nothing special about this crash, from either a global or just Bitcoin perspective.  The BTC crash in 2011 was far worse, as was the global crash of 2008.  We've since recovered from both (at least the markets have, if not the economy in general).  You have to remember, despite all the talks of a "billion dollar market cap", that Bitcoin is still small potatoes.  It's not quite penny-stock status, but it has the volatility of one.
To put it in perspective:  BTC has about the same market cap &amp; trading activity as a company like OfficeMax ($1bn, ~$10-$20 million per day in trading volume).  Compare to a compnay like Caterpillar, with a market cap of $55bn, and daily trading volume of $630 million.
The people that got burned by yesterday's crash are a tiny percentage of the people who trade with any regularity, and the traders themselves are a tiny percentage of those who hold bitcoins for any reason, either investment or commerce.

Yes, mostly.  I still think there's a place for credit-card-like services in a BTC economy, though.  I work in IT and I have several friends in IT who don't do any online commerce because of fear of fraud involving their credit cards.  BTC seems to offer even less security for the buyer (other than the stealing of card info, which, admittedly, is a big one), so I see that as a barrier to widespread acceptance of it as a online payment system.

Another way to state it:
Half a fortune is still a fortune.
If bitcoins go way up, would the amount of wealth you'd gain from a $25K investment be terrible compared to a $50K one?  Probably not.  But if you lose your investment, still having that other $25K around would come in handy.  Invest what you're prepared to lose.  And consider ahead of time what your exit strategy will be.  If you get lucky and things continue to go up, I'd recommend cashing out some fraction (&lt;25% over the next 18 months) to cover your initial outlay.
I wouldn't put more than 25% of my savings into something like bitcoin (at current prices, my holdings amount to about 5% of my liquid assets).  I sold some of my holdings for the first time back when BTC was $45, and now any gains I'll realize are pure profit, any losses are water under the bridge.

Not sure how escrow really fixes this.  Bitmit's escrow looks like it works where the parties involve have to prove that they're in the right (seller gives proof of shipment, or buyer gives proof that they didn't receive item).  But ultimately one party gets "screwed".  With a credit card, if the dispute can't be resolved, the credit card will eat the loss themselves, and put black mark next to the accounts of the two parties; if enough black marks accumulate, the party loses their privileges (the card, or the ability to accept those cards).
The loss of the ability to receive payment via credit card is a big deal for a vendor, so it's a strong disincentive to defraud buyers.  But is bitmit eating the losses for unresolved disputes?  I don't think so.
Ultimately there needs to be some third party that sits between buyers &amp; sellers that absorbs fraud losses, like credit card companies do today.  Bitpay looks like they do this, but I see no evidence that they absorb losses - only that they offer vendors a way of being paid in bitcoin for a feee.

Amendment to the final rule: My oft-repeated "Half a fortune is still a fortune" - have some kind of exit strategy.

And don't touch it until it hits those milestones.

Are any of these uses really anything other than the side effects of the fact that BTC is built upon cryptography?  Surely all these things are doable right now using plain old PGP or other crypto products.
It's like saying that dollars have "direct use" because you can burn them for heat, or use them as wallpaper or packing material (just as you could make jewelry or electronic components from gold).  Some of these uses destroy the wealth of the currency, others do not (I'm not sure there are any direct uses of gold that could destroy it, which is probably a big reason why it has been valuable for so long).

If you are familiar with public key / private key encryption, your "wallet file" is nothing more than the private key that authorizes you to send money from your bitcoin account (called an address in bitcoin-speak).  The blockchain you hear people talk about is basically a big bank ledger that says "these bitcoins were transferred from address X to Y at this time," and contains every transaction since the dawn of bitcoins.  It exists distributed among all machines in the bitcoin network, not unlike files that exist in the bittorrent network.
For someone who doesn't want to run the bitcoin client locally on their own machine, it is possible to create an address and have the wallet private key held by the third party - this is the "online wallet".  That service has the private key, and you get access to it via a password and/or any other security measures the site has set up.  You are trusting that they do not decide to just use that private key for themselves and steal your money, just as you assume a bank will not drain your account.
The thefts you've heard about come almost exclusively from online wallet services, where the thieves have gained access to the private key in the same manner that thieves of online data have been doing for years - website hacks, human engineering, guessing passwords, whatever.
If you create an address using the standard bitcoin client application and keep the wallet.dat file it creates somewhere safe, nobody will be able to get your bitcoins, unless they get that file (and you haven't encrypted it, or they guess the password).  So it's possible someone could steal those coins if your machine were compromised - you installed malware that keylogged, or made your machine part of a botnet, or whatever.
If you are confident that you have a machine that is "clean" (a good example would be a linux distro that boots entirely from a CD), you could make a wallet on that machine, copy the wallet.dat file to someplace safe (and redundant - make backups), and never connect it to a machine again.  This is what is known as "cold storage" or a cold wallet, and it acts as a kind of savings account - people could send money to that address, but you could never get money out of it, until you put that wallet.dat file on a machine that was connected to the internet.

I have yet to buy anything with BTC, but I'm curious: much has been made of the fact that BTC incurs no bank fees, and that no vendor has yet been burned by a chargeback - both things that make it appealing to vendors.  But does purchasing from places like this have any protection for the buyer?
Without the credit card middleman, there seems to be nothing that prevents unscrupulous retailers from accepting my BTC and shipping nothing in return.  If it were a credit card purchase, my card company would refund my money &amp; get on the vendor's case.  Of course, there's a price for this, and its reflected in the fee my vendor pays to the card issuer in exchange for the possibility of gaining me as a customer.
It seems like a bit of a paradox; BTC is a high-tech, net-based currency, yet it seems completely unsuitable for net-based commerce.  As cash (where I'm getting my goods face-to-face), it makes sense.

At this point, what protects the average Joe is that the bad guys aren't looking for you.  And though a having a compromised machine is going to get you in trouble if you do online banking, there's no question that you could get in more trouble with Bitcoin - there are no second tiers of protection.  For example, a bank would send snail-mail to your house if someone gained access to your account &amp; changed the mailing address, and if they did a direct transfer, you'd know what bank it went to (and MAYBE have some recourse).  No such luck with BTC.
Right now I don't trust any online entity with my wallet - I don't know who most of them are, who's behind them, even if they're incorporated in my country so that I could have some legal solutions to problems.  It's not a big deal to me to use a cold wallet with a linux boot disk because I'm a tech guy, but that's clearly not a long term solution for widespread adoption.
In the long run, if BTC is to be widely adapted, it will move beyond the libertarian/anarchist utopia that true believers hold to now - there will have to be large, centralized entities - like banks, in many ways - that would hold onto private keys and you would use in the manner of credit cards or online banking.  These entities would have to be publicly identifiable and visible to lawsuits in order for consumers to have some recourse if things went screwy.

Maybe I'm still wrong, but afaik, isn't Bitcoin basically just an accounts ledger (the blockchain), shared among all users of the system via a peer-to-peer file sharing system, and continuously verified by the peers?  All this talk of "virtual coins" or "numbers sent from one computer to another" (an absolutely meaningless simplification in the age of the Internet) just makes it sound more complicated and mysterious than it really is.

I keep telling people this over &amp; over:
Half a fortune is still a fortune.
If, in your personal estimation, your current holdings in bitcoin are wonderfully large - say, equal to your prior life savings, or equal to a couple years of income at your job - cash out half RIGHT NOW (over a few days or weeks, like he said).
Whether bitcoin crashes or goes into the stratosphere, you'll still have your "half fortune" - either half of what it is worth today, or half of what you dream about it being worth in the future.
My bitcoin holdings, at their current price, only represent maybe 7% - 10% of my net worth, so there's not a strong incentive for me to rush out and cash out half yet - it hasn't reached "fortune" status.  But I have cashed out a small portion of it - about 3x what I paid for it, so even if it goes to zero tomorrow, I have the satisfaction of knowing that I received a 200% gain on my original investment - better than any deal I've ever done in my life, even if it wasn't a big sum.

Everyone keeps comparing BTC to currency, but I think it really is more of a value-store commodity, like gold.  With that in mind, consider:
1.  Conservative estimates for the amount of gold in the world are 155,000 tonnes, and 95% of gold is used as a wealth store.
2.  That comes out to around 5.2 billion ounces, at $1500/ounce
3.  That comes to around 7.8 trillion dollars.
If you see BTC as an alternative to gold (as I do), figure how much of the gold market could BTC get?  At 5%, that's around $18,000/BTC.  My traditional rule of thumb for being able to live indefinitely in a carefree life (based on when I was making a lot of money, and computing my expenses) was $4 million in savings (say, $6 million if you plan on having a family).
$6 million at $18K/BTC comes out to 333 BTC, which at current $150 prices, amazingly arrives at $50K, the amount you intend to invest.
Could BTC capture 5% of the gold wealth-storage economy?  Maybe.

What "fundamentals" support $10?  Is there some other way to measure the value of BTC besides dividing the total amount of money interested in participating in the Bitcoin economy by the amount in circulation.   If you figure around 10M in circulation, where are you getting $100M from as the basis for these "fundamentals"?
As an asset that cannot be devalued by an outside entity, capturing 1% of the global wealth storage market does not seem to be unreasonable.   Or the enterprise is completely worthless and worth $0.  Both of these "fundamentals" seem more sound than $100M figure pulled out of the air.

I don't believe that's the way it works.  At any given point, the chance of you discovering a block is fixed based on the difficulty, regardless of how many other pools are operating, or how many other peers in your pool are working.
Disabling other pools will not make your pool run faster, and disabling peers in your own pool will not either.  Disabling your own pool will just mean your pool is less likely to find a block.
The only way I can see something like this working is if you're in a pool like Slush's, where the percentage of the reward that is given out is based on who has done work recently before the block has been discovered (in order to prevent people from exploiting via pool hopping - jumping out after doing some work in the beginning to another pool), but I'm not sure that would even work - it's not like if your pool has gone 2x or 3x the average time to find a block that you're "guaranteed" to find one soon.  Interfering with others in your pool just reduces the total hashrate again.
