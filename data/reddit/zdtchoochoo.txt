Mainstream media (BBC news being one of them) is reporting how volatile the price of BTC was this week (peak $20k, low $12k and my dad felt the need to tell me about it.   I've been following coinmarketcap the past few days and am aware of today's dip and recovery so he's not telling me anything I don't know.  
I don't know why my dad is so against BTC (it's not like I try to convince him to buy, in fact I hadn't talked about it to him since Nov 2013-Jan 2014), he just brings it up thanks to our local newspaper and the news sites he's subscribed to publish eye catching headlines.   After reading the BBC news headline, he proudly announced that there's no way he's going to invest in something that could be worth $20k one week and $10k the next.  Every time there's "bad" news from mainstream media criticizing bitcoin he tells me about it in a "I told you so" sort of way. Then when I countered how in the beginning of the year it was under $1000 and peaked to near $20,000, that the market cap for all coins combined was over $650B, he says, is that it?  He apparently misheard me and thought I said $650M.   He then went on to say so what, neither you nor I invested a year ago, so it's not important. 
Frankly I'm fed up of having dad keep trolling me about BTC's "flaws" and volatility.  Any advice on how to respond?  Maybe I should just leave the room when he gets on his soapbox?

I have a question that's not technical.  Instead I wonder how you would deal with family members who talk to you about bitcoin and, 4 years after first hearing about it, *still* refer to it as a ponzi scheme?  The recent rapid rise in value and the flooding of media coverage hasn't helped.   When I was unemployed in late 2013 and told my dad I was trading on a part time basis he blasted me for it saying it's a scam, it's a ponzi, you'll lose your money and your time, it's a bubble, etc. etc.  
Then when the price did crash down in 2014 he told me "I told you so" and periodically he would continue to ask me: how's it going with bitcoin, do you still trade it?   He dropped it after I repeatedly told him I stopped trading but now that the price has risen like 20x this year and it's all over the news, he's on his soapbox again calling it a ponzi scheme.  I can feel his scorn again and it annoying the heck out of me.   Yes, I'm looking for a full time job and plan to move out again soon.

One thing I don't understand is how journalists keep referring to bitcoin as a virtual currency rather than a digital one even when they interview people in the space and quote them as referring it as digital.

The thing is, I'm not even trying to convince him that BTC is good, I just told him that some people made millions off of it and how globally, there are hundreds of billions of dollars in the market (all coins combined).   He just looks at BBC news like some well respected entity and if they say it's volatile and can sink down to $12k USD, then it must be "bad".   But what especially irritates me is that anytime there's bad news about crypto , he feels the need to troll me about it as if I was someone who kept trying to convince him to buy buy buy.   I don't so I don't know why he feels the need for the "told you so" routine.

Good idea.  How about if family pesters you frequently about how they think btc is a ponzi, bubble, scam, etc. each time there is significant downward movement in the market?

I actually did buy a couple of BTC in 2013-2014 around the period of big pump and crash but foolishly traded it for alt coins, spent some of it online and ended up almost zeroing out my balance.   So I'm not part of the group of earlier adopters  who scored big this year and neither do I try to convince my dad of that.  I don't get why he's so against crypto.   But yeah I get what you're saying...keep it on the low down for now.

Great!  My dad is the opposite.  News headlines announce $20k to $12k drop and dad goes on an angry rant how it's too volatile for him to ever consider investing.  I never even suggested he do it, yet every time there's bad news he tries to show me he's right that it's too risky, it has no future, etc.  Tiresome.

Thank you for the advice mere minutes later.   My dad is someone who is takes my words for granted and is seemingly only swayed by concrete results.  It's the same with my job hunt.   I can tell him about the ads I applied to, the phone interviews I have, but unless I get an in person interview and a job offer, it's all wasted time according to him. 
It would be funny if one day I did tell him hey dad guess what, I bought a condo and the downpayment was paid for from BTC profits.

How about selling on localbitcoins?  You don't even have to meet in person

I remember him telling me how he invested like $100k into 10 stocks back in 1999-2000 and that the market wiped him out (likely bought and held until near zero).   Later on I believe he bought some tech stocks and otherwise has a financial planner he pays a percentage/fee to annually.  He doesn't talk about his finances to me so I don't understand why he is so critical about this.

I had a written offer, the highest one so far since graduating and regrettably listened to my mom who said to decline it.  No choice, gotta move on to the next opportunity.

Ha ha, that sums it up perfectly.

I understand what you're saying that older generations can have trouble adapting to new technologies.  Back in the late 80s-early 90s when residential internet was beginning to take off, my dad was actually someone who embraced emerging technologies.  Same thing with smartphones, he's had them longer than I have.
I don't expect him to really understand the tech behind Bitcoin and it doesn't help when "trusted" sources like BBC news keep reporting how volatile it is (therefore it must be dangerous and bad) to someone who grew up in another era.   I wish he would stop bringing it up so that I could go about my business and he could go about his own, essentially eliminating this friction between us.

Yeah I wondered the same thing.  What's with the nuclear mushroom cloud?

Annoying indeed.  Do you know of a semi polite way to stop parents from pestering you with judgemental criticism about your financial choices?  I'm not even involved in BTC trading at the moment and every time dad sees negative news, he angrily tells me how I made a mistake buying it before, it's volatile for him (I think it's because he prefers predictable circumstances and being in control) , etc. often pissing on my parade.

Hi there BagofSwag, thanks for your reply and for your advice. My dad got on his soapbox again today after he read a BBC news headline announcing how volatile BTC was this week rising to $20,000 and then sinking to $12,000 (it's now higher). I was in the kitchen getting some tea and he tells me this news as if I don't know, plus to troll me? He proudly announced that there's no way he's going to invest in something that could be worth $20k one week and $10k the next. I didn't even ask him to invest anything so I don't even know where he gets that from. It's just every time there's "bad" news from mainstream media criticizing bitcoin he tells me about it in a "I told you so" sort of way. Then when I countered how in the beginning of the year it was under $1000 and peaked to near $20,000, that the market cap for all coins combined was over $650B, he says so what, neither you nor I invested a year ago, so it's not important. I don't even go out of my way to tell him anything about btc, he's the one that brings it up. So annoying.
