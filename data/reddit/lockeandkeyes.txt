But we're not even talking about me (straight, white guy) calling someone gay. What we're talking about is basically a bunch of gay guys calling a non-gay person gay. 
And, for the record, I'm not for bullying or deliberately trying to hurt someone. I was bullied; know how that feels. I might be a straight guy but I've never been very macho so, in my backwoods high school, I was bullied for being gay... like had rocks thrown at me. 
What I'm saying is, if a group wants to make fun of their own stereotypes, especially to ridicule the stereotype and point out how untrue and absurd it is, that will do way more to take away the sting of an insult than acting offended all the time.

100% of the people I know who openly joke about cheap jews are my jewish friends. Chill man. Poking fun at ourselves, and others, is okay so long as it isn't mean spirited.
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:59:17
Well I'm sorry if you're offended but... They were literally just making fun of themselves. 
I'm curious, why do you take such offense to this? You seem to have a personal stake in it.
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:15:18
Eh, you seem like the condescending one. He might have a low brow, vaguely obnoxious humor, but I'd take "tries to be funny" over "tries to know it all". 
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:09:21


You misunderstand. I'm not saying "I have jewish friends, therefore I can crack the worst jokes ever at their expense." I'm saying my jewish friends are the ones who crack the most jokes about jews. I don't, personally. 
I'll put it this way: I was with them on a trip back in high school, and one of my friends dropped a quarter on pavement, making a loud ping. I looked down, none of them did, and they laughed and called me a total jew for looking. 
It's OK to joke about these things.

I'm sorry you don't understand, 
Basically, if you look at the month scale, bitcoin is still up. So HODL. However, if you looked at the hourly scale, you would panick thinking it was a crash. 
Now do you get it? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:22:00
Actually now that you mention it, 2010 was wrong. I meant 2013, my bad. I'm not good with dates. :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:44:09
it might be a tad late to jump on the BTC bubble (if it is a bubble), but it might not be. Its really hard to say. 
That being said, litecoin / ethereum are pretty consistent in their values. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:24:30
ok, a data trend such as a general upwards slope is not the same as a fad and you know that. Don't be stupid. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:36:11
eh, a trend that lasts a month is worth watching. :P 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:27:06


Alright, fuck you dude. 
In 2013, I was in college, mining as a hobby. That was also 4 years ago. I didn't have a huge amount of bitcoin, and only invested like 20$ in it, so the fact that it dropped in price pretty significantly never traumatized me enough to scar that date in my brain. I remembered doing this all as a freshman, but when you pointed out that there were no ASICs then, I thought oh, I must have been a junior. 
It was a tiny USB ASIC that barely was better than a GPU. 
Maybe you should back the fuck up and realize that not everyone is trying to karma whore? or look at my history on this account and see that in 2013, I was posting in @_date: 2017-12-13 14:47:37
It's possible you may be right, but one day you will be wrong about this. 
Depends on if we've stopped finding coins in blocks yet. Anyone know?
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:21:32
I mean comparatively. BTC was skyrocketing yesterday while LTC and ETH remained basically the same. Yes, over months, none of them are consistent, but some of them are less consistent than others. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:09:22
In bull market : "Bitcoin is decentralized which makes it safe!" 
In bear market: "Omg bitcoin would be so great if it weren't for insider trading!" 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:45:51
Nah, I bought a 20$ asic, mined for .01 bitcoins, sold during the crash. It was a fun experience and hobby that made a decent return but I could have made way more if I HODL'd
@_date: 2014-03-16 16:00:57
 Because he took the money out of his left hand and put it into his right, so his right side is definitely way more profitable... 
Right? /s
Serious note: it would be an easy way to transfer funds to your node without paying a transaction fee, though.
@_date: 2014-06-05 15:29:29
Goddamnit. I just gave the last of my bitcoin to gyft.com. Granted, I never had much, and everything I had, I mined myself (because I didn't want to get involved with exchanges). Now the price is going to skyrocket. :C
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:12:43
That would be a clever way to do it. Though I would be hesitant to announce when it would happen. Sounds like someone could try to abuse it 
@_date: 2014-09-04 14:29:03
My advice: BUY BUY BUY. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 17:08:50
I ironically ditto.
@_date: 2014-06-10 16:00:49
Every ASIC i've seen, as well as mining rigs in general, have been incredibly tasteful. Even when my USB ASIC became "worthless" (ie: non-cost effective), I kept it because it looks so cool. I keep meaning to make it into something worn (Belt buckle?) but I can't think of anything that isn't tacky as hell in comparison to the awesomeness of the asic.

* At the end of 24 hours, give 4 doge to winner. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 00:17:40
Oh cool, thanks for letting me know that.
@_date: 2014-04-16 16:50:27
it might be erroring to a default error message. IE: "Can't find discount" means that it couldn't find the price in bitcoin-- which WOULD be significantly smaller.

I agree. 
Also, I wish I had said incrementSpeed() instead.

Yeah. slowclap.begin() makes more sense. That way you could have slowclap.increasespeed/stop() as well too.

There might actually be a distinction there though. I am not at all familiar with polish laws, but in America at least: it's legal to promote your product. It's illegal to talk shit about other people's products by name. That's why you never see Pepsi put out an ad saying "Coke is fizzy ass-water made from dead children".

@_date: 2013-11-24 20:02:12
Not the best defense, but on pawn stars they said it would be illegal for them to give gold for a car they were buying. Might be because of their state or their business license though.
@_date: 2013-11-29 03:36:00
I'm more looking into trustworthy exchanges that operate in the US.
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:43:46
I'm pretty sure it's not legal to sell goods for gold directly in the USA anyways
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:47:54
That works! :D

Eh, I meant a bitcoin wallet within their wallet. it was really early. lol

I think it would also be interesting to note the size of the bitchain versus the cost of 1 GB of storage.

I have an ASIC at 330mh/s and my GPU (AMD Radeon, running only 1 thread as multithreading lags the shit out of me) for an additional 35MH/s and both numbers usually fluctuate a little higher than that, so 400 was a safe guess. :P 
@_date: 2013-09-13 14:44:08
Hahahahahaha oh man... And here I was trying to be helpful.
@_date: 2013-08-24 21:59:45
CGminer keeps getting flagged as a virus for me though I'd love to try it. I'm uncertain on why it would be marked as a trojan. Could you inform me?
@_date: 2013-08-24 19:29:18
That's what GUIminer is saying, and the website is actually reporting that I'm moving at a speed of 0mh/s though I must've made progress because I have 1 share. 
Voodoo is happening. 
Also:I doubt it's HIGH end. Probably should still be able to pull 6 or 10 times what it's doing though.

You're now defending your attacking defense.

Question; how would you generate the price of the object in BTC? 
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:30:15
Hey, sometimes it's code like this that saves the day. I once had to makes a linked list into a doubly linked list (ie: You can move through it backwards or forwards). So I took the backwards code and basically said if this is wrong, use the forwards code and return that. 
@_date: 2013-08-25 00:28:27
I'll just wait til the ASIC chip comes in. ;) Learning from experience always sucks for things like this. Thanks again for everything!
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:46:43
Thanks! Was hoping to wrap my head around this. 
@_date: 2013-08-24 22:45:50
yeah thanks! Another user said something similar so i just let it through my protections. Currently averaging 60mh/s on a fucking laptop. Unfortunately, it's not so good at cooling itself off though, so I'm running at 60~70C. Got a fan between my legs under the (glass) desk, hoping to cool it. Is there a particular temperature I should avoid letting it hit?
@_date: 2013-09-13 13:41:51
Never heard of Vodaphone before your post, saw no one replied. I managed to find this though so hopefully it answers your question? Interesting subject at least.

But yeah, I already have an ASIC chip in the mail. &lt;3 amazon. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:22:19
lol using predefined objects from the API would've been cheating... well more so than I did. We basically had to make a node that links to other nodes (a next and a previous).

What is this bitcoin tip business?
@_date: 2013-10-01 17:36:14


No... it's owned by the Federal reserve, which is a private entity (bank).
Note how, at the top of each dollar, it says federal reserve note.
@_date: 2013-08-26 14:56:16
I was. The issue was, apparently, with the miner I was using. CGMiner gets 30-40mhs for me. without changing anything else. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:29:10
But there's no required confirmations... how do they know?

Got bitcoins bitch should be the cryptocurrency equivalent of got milk?
@_date: 2013-08-30 13:41:11


isn't that what ANY subreddit does? 
More specifically, if you're referring to the "bill gates said the word bitcoin" style articles, you have to realize that such an influential figure recognizing the currency legitimizes it for a lot of people, and more importantly reminds people that it exists. We're still a pretty damn small community of people who actually know what cryptocurrency is. 
Not to mention that getting an endorsement from technology experts could lead to a higher price of coin as more people buy into it. Factors like this are important for predicting market value; the articles serve their point even if it's not at face value.

@_date: 2013-08-24 19:39:40
Already tried several pools. Same results, and mining 2 at once divides it pretty evenly. It could be the miner though. 
Would 50miner work with a ASICMiner Erupter USB? Have one ordered for sake of nostalgia when I can look back in 30 years like I imagine some people look at old floppies.  
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:06:28
I did, and it worked 99% of the time, but there was a really, really weird unexplainable but reproduce-able glitch that would throw a null error. 
This was only my first year of java though so don't be too hard. I've gotten better.

Whoops didn't mean to commit a taboo. Just trying to let people know about the site. Not even sure what the benefits to the referral system are.
