So it will function the same as bitcoin then lol

Why do you say that?
@_date: 2014-04-28 17:09:35
Don't even need to make people buy USD, just use a service that converts the BTC into USD before it gets to your account, now you are never touching bitcoin.

I believe that only a small fraction of people are morally bad. This is an early idea/industry and of course people are going to look to cash in on it quick. The same thing happened when the internet was young. How many people sent money to a prince in some small African country in hopes of a fortune? Now though it's common knowledge, no law can stop it from happening. Sure you can punish the person who did it, but that didn't stop it from happening. People now know that this is a most likely a scam and not to trust it. If they choose to trust it and invest their money they take a risk. 
You see no reason why companies won't just run off with all their customers bitcoins, but do you honestly believe that a majority of people would do that? If you do, I'm afraid you have a dark view of society that I disagree with.

Let's hope they keep accepting it after the easy business has gone away. I hear about lots of businesses that start taking bitcoin, then due to lack of sales they stop because they have to keep retraining staff.

From their announcement it seems like they themselves are ready to try and push Bitcoin to a larger audience. To the moon!

We have 6 BTM machines here in Toronto and a total of 2 stores accept it!!
@_date: 2014-12-18 03:38:02
Are the BTMs? There is one at bay and dundas inside the bus terminal downstairs, there is one at Decentralize just south of king on spadina, and there is one right at yonge and stclair. There are more, but those are the ones I have been to and can vouch for.

They haven't won. Yes they made a quick buck, but in the long run no one SHOULD ever trust them again. Now that the market is aware of the way they run a business they will eventually run out of money again and no one will give them any for any service.
On the flip side, if they took enough money from people to never need money again. Tough shit to those who CHOOSE to invest with that business. We can't always assume someone (or regulation) is going to be there to protect us from bad people. We have to be willing to take calculated risks on what we do with our money. It's just like with any phishing scam. It all comes down to education.

It's what I've heard from others. Managers got tired of having to go over once every 2 weeks or in some cases only once a month to show who ever is working the cash how it's done. Different places do it differently as well. I agree it is way easier than debit/credit. But those system people are so used to because practically every transaction you are using it. Bitcoin not so much. Just means we as a community need to make sure we spend bitcoin at local stores whenever we get a chance.
@_date: 2017-02-04 21:05:15
That's because there is currently a big back log of transactions. With each block being 1mb and averaging out to ten minutes a block means that bitcoin has a limit in the amount of transactions it can process in a set time. So people are needing to wait for their confirmation to be included in a block longer than before as there are more transactions fighting for the limited size in blocks.
A great visual aid to show this:

We may never know if hacking affects the pricing, but I'm sure an active exchange going offline for a few days would slow down the markets. The important thing to keep in mind here is that bitcoin itself and the blockchain technology are not at fault for these hacks. It's the problem of the service which is utilizing bitcoin.
One of the core principles of bitcoin is personal responsibility. You are responsible for your bitcoin, if you lose them it's your fault. If you trust your bitcoins with someone else (or online service) there is nothing stopping someone from up and taking them. It would be like a bank closing shop and taking everyone's savings. 
Since bitcoin is so early people are still trying to figure things out. Much like when the internet first started and was super unsecure and the reason why my mom still doesn't trust shopping online. Basically each time a big hack like this happens it helps to improve the strength of the current infrastructure by showing it's flaws to the public. 
If you want to try and mess around with bitcoin a bit there is nothing wrong with that, just keep them offline on your computer or phone. Your phone is great for anything under $100 in my opinion, perfect to show friends and maybe send them a few bits to demonstrate. That has yet to be broken and is the equivalent to having cash in your wallet.

Finally another porn site!! I thought xhamster was the only one willing to try out Bitcoin. I thought online gambling and poker would be the first to adopt bitcoin, seems like that's taking a lot longer than I thought.

Same thing is happening to me right now. A user started a dispute with me and the dispute has been resolved yet my account is still frozen. That was 2 days ago, 4 days when the dispute started. It took them almost 2 days to respond to my support ticket, and I still haven't heard back since that one response which gave me no info. It's very frustrating, I have 2k sitting on LBC right now.

The main difference being I have to leave my home for those stores. Looking the mirror while a pair of glasses overlays the clothes on your body, and move with your. Would be so amazing.

Oh i agree it's more efficient. But the internet works wonders and with VR you can display it on a flat surface and then when selected it can come to life via hologram/VR. Think of shopping and being able to inspect the same object you are buying digitally, Ebay could use it as well. Any online store. You could even use it to try on clothes. I'm thinking like 2nd generation Hololens or where ever VR takes us.

Where bitcoin beats his great gold credit card, is that bitcoin doesn't need a trusted 3rd party to hold my bitcoin, or a trusted 3rd party to mail me my bitcoin if I no longer trust the 3rd party. 
GoldMoney becomes the great overseer of all transactions in Schiff's world, and as a result they would have the ability to be regulated or regulate themselves. Bitcoin can not be regulated.

I think he's gotten so comfortable in his ways he doesn't need anything new like bitcoin. Therefore he dismisses the idea without giving it much thought.

I was just discussing VR with my sister who is not a tech savvy person at all. Same thing with Bitcoin. She asks "what would I use this for? Why is this useful to me? What does this offer that I can't get elsewhere already?"
I try and tell her that people didn't think they would be using the internet at all, "what's the point of that? I don't need it." Sort of attitudes. Now those same people today can't live without it. The same thing will happen with bitcoin. 99% of the population don't even understand the internet and how it works. They have no idea about DNS protocols, what an ISP actually does, how a server works. Many people still think they download facebook to their computer. 
The average person doesn't NEED to understand bitcoin in the slightest. They just need to trust in it that it will work. That is something that will only come with time and more people using it. The people big name people and big name companies are what will allow people to truly put their trust in Bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-10-09 19:51:25
People seeing value in it. I see value in Bitcoin, therefore I buy bitcoin, leaving less for others to get. Making the price raise.
I don't see value in Bitcoin anymore, I sell bitcoin, putting it back on the market increasing supply. Making the price lower.
This is a very simple example. People seeing value in bitcoin creates the demand.
