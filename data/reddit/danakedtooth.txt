Waiting for mine in the mail! Can't wait to test this unit out, all the comments are really positive. Keep up the good work KeepKey.

What Tokenly offers is innovative and is attempting to solve specific crowdfunding problems. It's apparent that people care about this technology but these are new markets and anything can happen. Might as well be part of innovation rather than fight with it, these things are happening whether you like it or not. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 14:56:44
it doesn't have to be, it's the correlation visually that I was pointing out. I can't wait for people to rip this apart lol 
@_date: 2014-02-23 18:44:39
Ya I'm pushing this project, I've been marketing it all over the net. How else do start ups get a leg up? The indiegogo campaign is moving along and if you're interested in supporting this project please head to our page :) 
@_date: 2014-02-23 18:24:07
I'm not the one behind this platform. I'm here to inform people that it exists and my opinion is it should be supported. Again, this is an opinion and you're entitled to yours as well. I value your opinion but have to again point out that this is till in it's infancy. Time will tell whether a platform like this is profitable and good for the community. It seems like you're already made your decision about this project. I admire your quick responsiveness however it's important for people to make their own judgements. Just because I don't fully understand (which I'm fully capable of admitting) doesn't mean the back end of this team doesn't :P
I think time will tell whether there is room in the crypto world for an arbitrage system. we have seen it before (only web based) and this will be the first actual program of it's kind.
I may have a vested interested in this project so I'm standing behind it. Time will tell and I'm happy to take a risk at the moment. If I wasn't a risk taker in the first place I wouldn't be involved in crypto's. All I ask is you don't call a system YOU don't fully understand a scam. I've been working hard on getting the word out about this platform because like others, I believe in it. Just because you don't doesn't mean you should try and tarnish the work others are doing
@_date: 2014-02-20 13:28:39
It's also fine if you're not interested in supporting this project but many people do see the potential and are willing to make a contribution to a team who is working on bettering these crypto-communities. This is just one way of taking advantage of the opportunities between markets and I think the work people are doing on this project should be rewarded. You're again, entitled to your own opinion however it's important for people to make their own opinions about these type of projects because they aren't fully understood yet. Just because you believe the market is one way doesn't make it so. you're input is appreciated but calling this a scam and telling people not to support it isn't the right approach. comparing this to a forex system does show your misinformation about this project and it turn doesn't look very good on you. let people make their own opinions without trying to push yours on them
@_date: 2014-02-20 13:07:24
This is not an automatic system, I suggest you try to understand this platform before making a judgement.
There are automatic portions of the platform but final conversions are actually done manually. 
Take another look at it, there is definitely room for a service like this, you first must understand the opportunity at hand
@_date: 2014-02-23 18:34:30
no evil here :) simply someone marketing a project they believe in! great support so far and I welcome any comments anyone may have. thanks for your input 
@_date: 2015-05-24 05:33:08
They should think about adding Clef for 2FA
@_date: 2016-03-26 19:24:39
constructive input, thanks for that!
@_date: 2015-05-27 04:29:54
nice to see Clef getting around! So quick and easy
@_date: 2016-03-26 16:23:45
let's put our thinking caps on here, I think with the right approach it could be obtainable. 
@_date: 2016-03-26 16:22:50
I disagree.. raw numbers are important. It's an overlying effect that has drastic implications. 
@_date: 2016-03-26 16:21:50
I think in a creative fashion the incentives can provide addition exposure resulting in a positive outcome for the network.
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:02:40
this was fun
@_date: 2016-02-28 23:16:11
you could say that about anything. Look it up on bitcointalk. We are legendary posters with a solid reputation. 
@_date: 2016-02-28 05:49:57
wow, you think we're gettin 20k submissions? You're giving us far too much credit. If we wanted to have a banner we'd have a banner. You clearly aren't interested in joining the community so move on.. or keep commenting and helping our cause! 
@_date: 2016-02-28 00:39:36
I guess they wouldn't. It's a pilot anyway so things will probably change. For this first test, it's not a concern. Plus who's going to go to all that trouble anyway?
@_date: 2016-02-28 18:25:17
thank you for your suggestions. We're not looking to fool anyway or be malicious whatsoever. The sooner people realize this the more time we can spend on pleasing the community than defending our choices. 
@_date: 2016-02-28 18:26:17
It just so happens that the day we decided landed on April fools. The contest is no joke, we're giving away the coin regardless
@_date: 2016-02-28 18:38:52
great suggestion. We're doing our best to quickly show the community we are friends, not foes. Looking forward to the process
@_date: 2016-02-28 22:06:12
it was donated to the team, we're simply running the contest and had no obligations whatsoever to make the prediction about LTC. We will likely introduce a LTC version in due time. 
@_date: 2016-02-28 00:44:16
Thanks for your input. Stay tuned as we launch more prediction contests!
@_date: 2016-02-28 05:22:26
you've considerably over analyzed the situation. Look at it how you want, we're simply a blockchain site looking to create a base while rewarding our visitors at the same time. There are way more illegitimate sites in this space than legitimate. Recognize a genuine effort, bud
@_date: 2016-02-28 18:26:59
If you haven't sent in your prediction through the site make sure to do that before March 10th
@_date: 2016-02-28 18:23:57
this has been mentioned before. See it how you like but as you can see we're very open with the community, are not willing to betray our readers and are offering an opportunity to get a limited edition physical coin. People point out the price of LTC is $3.50, which is true, however think of the coin as a collectors item. No one knows the future price of these. 
@_date: 2016-02-28 06:02:13
If you would take the time to look into things you would see that this is our very first contest. We're paying out of pocket to host it and regardless of submissions we will be giving the prize away. In the future the prizes will be different and better so take what you can get, if you want it, and stop complaining about someone trying to give you something for free. Give us your spam email and throw a number at us. We can tell you exactly what your chances are when we close the poll on March 10th
@_date: 2016-02-08 20:46:38
suggestions added, thank you!
@_date: 2016-02-28 01:45:28
good guess! Make sure to use two decimal places. A guess of 420.00 has already been submitted
@_date: 2016-02-28 01:56:22
I'm sure it's understandable that the prize wouldn't be a physical BTC  considering it's the first contest and the given price. If there is one donated however we will include it in our contest.. wink wink
@_date: 2016-02-23 19:00:07
fair comparison. This has got me thinking.. Thanks for the input :)
@_date: 2016-02-28 05:40:59
creativity counts for something and we clearly hold it at a much higher standard than yourself. We're not forcing anyone to do anything and some sort of "standard" rate to go by is irrelevant. If someone has an idea that brings traffic who says they shouldn't use their creativity to do so? 
@_date: 2016-02-28 18:28:02
Thank you for your support. We will have better prizes as we progress and grow our community and our contest. This is the first one and we're trying our best to be as transparent as possible in order to establish ourselves as a reliable source for blockchain info. 
@_date: 2016-02-28 01:56:39
Thanks for the support, keep checking back as we add more contests!
@_date: 2015-04-01 16:35:54
i'd recommend looking at Clef as a 2FA sollution for Klondike/BitPay
@_date: 2015-04-15 20:25:45
Any need for 2FA? I'd recommend Clef
@_date: 2015-04-17 14:42:31
@_date: 2015-04-15 01:47:02
How is BTCXIndia's 2FA? They could look at using Clef
@_date: 2015-04-09 19:10:32
does overstock have 2FA? I'd like to see more sites use Clef 
@_date: 2015-04-10 21:35:09
shoulda used Clef lol
@_date: 2015-04-17 14:43:49
what's their 2FA like? I'd recommend Clef
@_date: 2015-04-22 02:17:40
they should consider using something like Clef
@_date: 2015-04-07 21:02:13
Do they have 2FA? I want to see more sites use Clef
@_date: 2015-11-28 21:26:28
shopping spree on btc black fri
@_date: 2015-03-18 16:39:23
Keep your website, use a coinpayments button and accept bitcoin and all sorts of alts for your services
@_date: 2015-03-27 16:46:24
They should also look at  for added 2FA security
@_date: 2015-03-20 00:11:09
I don't believe it's open source, yet the company states they don't hold any private keys - it's all kept on your phone. They don't sell your info either, big plus in my mind. 
@_date: 2015-03-20 21:31:16
for sure, it's one step at a time IMO and Clef has off to a great start. I'm sure they have decentralization in mind
@_date: 2017-07-06 02:46:01
I did and they told me to change my pw and look at my login history. What should I say to them seeing as it's a multisig address?
@_date: 2015-03-19 02:58:39
.06% is still .06%/. You may not want to deal in fiat but others don't mind. Considering this isn't an absurd % like we have seen recently, it's worth a 2nd look imo, not only that they have some other neat features worth mentioning 
@_date: 2015-03-31 18:18:32
Any 2FA? I'd recommend checking out  for use on Coinfloor
@_date: 2017-06-09 21:58:20
having volume doesn't make them reputable. It's nothing to do with pr, they are outright scam artists who look to take advantage of their own customers. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 13:59:41
Major exchange? Do people not yet realize Yobit has the worst track record and has been rife with internal market manipulation and selling from the beginning? This exchange is toxic and should be shutdown. I can't even count the times they screwed their clients over.
