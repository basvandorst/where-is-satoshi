They're human and can feel the pressure of the public like anyone else. 
I'm a long-time Apple user and I find this disappointing and disturbing. Much more than Product RED, Bitcoin could truly change the world.

My Nexus 5 worked for texting, talking on the phone, and taking Instagram photos. Hangouts? Very cool way to integrate everything. 
But webpages rendered so slowly it seemed pointless to surf. At first I thought it was WIFI, but LTE performed just as poorly, on the same carrier I was with on my iPhone. The apps I enjoy the most (Skyview, Living Earth) had equivalents in the Google App Store that were horrendous, performance-wise. I mean, absolutely no comparison between how smooth the graphics performed on iPhone 5S vs the Nexus 5. 
I didn't like confirming an app's permission to view EVERYTHING on my phone before I had even used the app (Apple forces developers to ask permission from Apple servers as the action is performed, not before. Apple then asks the users as the security arbiters, not the developers.)
Maybe I picked a bad Android phone to start out with? I don't know. I thought it was Google's "flagship phone" and therefore had to be a higher quality than it was. 
I'm still open to Android, but I feel like I'm speccing out a gaming PC when I'm looking at different models. Like "which one should I pick that has the ability to process graphics and take photos like a 5S?" Is that the Galaxy S4? 
Anyway, the final straw was I found myself wanting to play some Podcasts, and after scouring for apps that worked 1/10th as well as the Apple Podcasts app, I gave up and put the SIM card back in the 5S. 
I want to jump ship from Apple for a variety of reasons including the recent Bitcoin mess, but right now my 5S is a great experience. When another phone feels the same way, I'll use it instead.

Download the recent Joe Rogan Podcast with Andreas Antonopoulos. It's a fun listen, and he really frames Bitcoin well for non-technical peeps.
