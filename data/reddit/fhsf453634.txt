yeah.. this NFC stuff is looking like a really bad idea actually. get a couple of people with NFC enabled smartphones, one scanning random people and the other paying for something in a shop. It might be tricky to get the timing right but you could proxy the transaction over the phones. The guy who's buying's phone talking to the NFC scanner and to the scanning guy's phone over 3g which then talks to the victim's card pretending to be the shop scanner.. I guess it sounds a bit crazy, but it seems like something that could work pretty well - say the scanning guy is on a bus or something... there's 20-30 people all around probably one of them has an NFC enabled credit card.. and they can stand next to them for several minutes.. plenty of time for the buying guy to get to the cashier and pay for some items.

you can buy second life money for paypal on virwox.com and then trade it for bitcoins.
there are also some shady exchanges for converting paypal to liberty reserve which can then be transferred to a bitcoin exchange and sold for bitcoins. Try here;
some of them say they take paypal.

 1) download/install the bitcoin wallet client application from 
 2) generate a new bitcoin address
 3) copy &amp; paste the address into mtgox's withdraw bitcoins form field
 ...
 4) receive bitcoins
 5) profit? 
 If you haven't already installed the bitcoin client be aware that the first time you run it, it will take hours to catch up with downloading the blockchain (the history of all bitcoin transactions ever).
 Perhaps you should only withdraw a very small amount of bitcoins (0.001 or something) the first time (not your whole mtgox balance) and make sure you've got the hang of it.
