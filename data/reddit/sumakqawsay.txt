We should write a smartcontract on Ethereum to mine, so we could say that we're doing "*blockchain mining*"

It depends what you mean by "good".
If you mean *rich,* then it looks like a financial question.
If you mean *free*, from any form of monetary or bank domination, then I think it could get better.Around 17.9 bitcoins has already been mined and not even a billion people on Earth owns one... it looks like we could live in a worst plutocracy than we currently are.

Shake it and you're good.

Sadly, it is since some peeps are mining &amp; speculating. It wouldnt be if there was no speculation, but Bitcoin is speculation kingdom.

Am I the only one thinking that BTC """mass""" adoption, if it happens too fast (before most people on Earth get how it works and why i could be trusted, or doesnt need to be trusted), could leads to civil war ?   
I mean, we're clearly early adopters, and most of us give more trust to cryptocurrencies than fiat. But reality is our society is still built on fiat currencies relations. Adopting any crypto could, in my opinion, leads to people to stop trusting their fiat, and create (with other financial reasons that i dont master) the biggest financial crisis we ever had. It could be even worst.   
My point : not enough peoples are aware of HOW crypto works, HOW to use it, and WHY use it. Also, our all society is built on a relation between fiat and power.

It's not financial relation in my opinion, it's based on the fact that people are loosing faith and trust on the financial, economical and monetary system. Most dollar value is owned by big fisces, but it only has value because billions of humans think it has value. That's the limit of a trust based model

Do you think the big companies's leaders, the stock holder, and the most influent people will let us do that plan ? I wish so, a peaceful and smart upgrade of our system. But the problem is that nowadays, their money grants them proportional decision power, and they are actualy owning people's money and deciding how much it is worth. 
It looks to me like a pretty locked situation where we've to be super smart if we dont want thing to escalate.

Well their's 2 main argument for people only attract by lucrativ goals :   
\- if ppl get why we need blockchains and how blockchain works (+ the need of a decentralised etalon value, sucha as BTC, LTC or whatever), they'll want it, and we'll ALL moon. (most efficient way to create even more value)  
\- If they dont get why decentralisation is needed, we might see awfull centralised situation in the next few years. Blockchain are still threaten
