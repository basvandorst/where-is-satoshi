That is true but in this context I mean computer data.
For example, I can send the order for a box through the Internet but I can't send a box through the Internet.

The Internet is a means of communication so you move a file through the Internet, moving a file is not the Internet.
The Internet is how you send, communicate, the information, not what happens to the information.
EDIT: How about this, name one thing using the Internet that isn't through the communication of information.

That's literally all the Internet is, a means of communicating. It's a network of interconnected devices and protocols that allows the exchanging of information. That's all the Internet does.
Just because something works, doesn't mean it works well or doesn't have limits. Bitcoin works phenomenally as an intermediary currency. It's basically a universal currency translator. 
If everyone switched to only Bitcoin you would begin to see problems. Bitcoin is a deflationary currency so it promotes saving, wealth consolidation, and wealth inequality. These things are generally bad for an economy.
Bitcoin is also inherently unstable in value so you'll see boom bust cycles with no way to correct, just like with the gold standard.

How does fiat currency create wealth consolidation?

What is wrong with my statement?

How do you grow an economy without spending?

Why would that be the Internet? Just because the Internet is a way of transferring information doesn't mean all methods of transferring information are the Internet.
The Internet is a specific set of standards that allows networks to interconnect.

What is one thing done with the Internet that is not simply communicating information?

You are communicating the information of the file through the Internet. The Internet is not creating a new file, the device on the other end is, nor is the Internet deleting the original file, the device sending it does.


If you are talking about copying a file from one device, say a phone, to another device, say a computer, at your house through WiFi, then yes, you are doing the exact same thing as you are doing over the Internet. You are using the same protocols and standards.
It's the scope and scale that matters. Think of it like roads. What's the difference between an interstate and an avenue?

What can be done because of the Internet should not be confused with what the Internet is.

This is why gold is a good indicator of the health of an economy. When an economy is good people are investing in stocks and real estate. When the economy goes south, they want to minimize their value loss.
