I wouldn't be surprised if if the funding has been SET UP by Western states. Maybe this is their reason to abandon cryptos. Fear of the boogeyman buying terrorist weapons with cryptos. Which would mean they are getting weapons from the government

If you look at the previous years of the conference's, Bitcoin prices and alt coin prices went up right after the conference's ended. In fact they doubled and triplled for a month until they slowly found a rest. Last time it was may 22 and the price of Bitcoin was up more than 100% a week or so later. Same with the previous year. 
And each year they had more people and more price increase.
So if that's anything to go by then all the coins should go up within a week

Bitcoin doesn't even make sense anymore what it's doing in the market .

You obviously did that yourself there is an outline of just melted snow around the B while around that it's all dry.  Nice try 
@_date: 2018-11-19 12:18:45
So what do the experts have to say now why Bitcoin dropped? Haha none of you know shit and I said it once and said again. Bitcoin is heavily manipulated by a few large whales who decide when it goes up and down.  None of you can tell when that will be 
@_date: 2018-11-24 17:04:42
Because nobody believes ur story. Anybody can ask for free stuff and pretend on the internet. Nothing new. Show ur street address also and we know ur telling the truth

Yeah and supply and demand is decided by who? ;)
@_date: 2018-11-09 12:41:43
So why did everybody decide to buy in late 2017 and dump in early 2018. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:26:45
Lol I bet it's just a temporary upswing , and in the next days or weeks it will crash even more
@_date: 2019-01-27 02:38:36
I own some tron which I bought with bitcoin.
Its pretty obvious that a lot of these coins are manipulated and even held back from breaking out .
Bitcoin will go down I think another 1.5k
@_date: 2019-01-27 13:44:07
Yeah considering tron is the only coin going up while everything else is dropping for the last month, keep hating dumbass lmao
@_date: 2019-01-28 02:01:54
Scam coin? How so when it is being used for something actually and gaining more popularity and market share ? It went from 12th place to 8th place in market cap just in the last 3 months and it's still rising . You are the one being a dickhead but I guess I should kno you are just a dumb bored troll

I have a feeling this whole yellow vest thing is organized by the rothschilds themselves. This seems like our dream come true. The cabal under attack.
But its way too organized for random people to have started it. Also with the bitcoin and blockchain taking off at the same time and widespread media attention in bitcoin the last two years (who controls the media ), to me it's just confirms we are switching to a digital age of currency where it will appear that we are beating the cabal.
Meanwhile the cabal made it known many years ago that everything will be digital. 
Another sign is just try yellow vest themselves. 
If people wore their own clothing, it would be hard to identify the protesters. This way they gave jerseys to the team who's against them, making all the followers easy targets with their bright yellow vests that can be seen from a satellite

Quadriga was the only place I was able to convert my bitcoins to dollars and e transfer my gains to my bank account.
So now I can't make dollars out of my bitcoin ,?
Which other place in Canada can I convert btc into dollar ?
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:35:17
Ya BTC going to the moon and all the alt coins having a hard time catching up. First time.i seen this. All of a sudden trx and others  is still struggling even tho Bitcoin is up 10%
But if Bitcoin was down 10% they would follow
@_date: 2019-05-10 20:31:29
Ok so do you have a reason how tron was 10x higher in 2017 along with all the other coins, when bitcoin went up?
All the other coins went up to. So who's doing the scamming ? And now it's the opposite so how can this be?  I asked for explanation, not somebody telling me what I already feel. You must feel so proud, I'm sure you knew you were gona be down 15k last year with bitcoin too  mr I know it all.
@_date: 2019-05-11 03:17:56
But I already made my money back in 2017 when I had put it into tron during the bull run. 
Then I kept half in tron and pulled half out. I didnt lose anything really. Gonna keep waiting
@_date: 2019-05-11 01:04:05
You talk rubbish. Your perceived value of bitcoin fluctuates 1000% in a 2 year period. Bitcoin is no different than any major alt coin and in fact is more outdated. It was the first to come out and be used as currency and that's about it. The transaction time and rates are much better on other coins and coins such as trx are already widely used in many applications. 
Also bitcoin is a scam too since many exchanges shut down such as quadriga.cx which is what I used to transfer money. You have a hard time getting your money from bitcoin even today
@_date: 2018-12-11 12:15:13
Yeah im pretty sure there are thousands of people saying their good prayers for Bitcoin to go up and make them rich. I am still waiting too. But it's obvious to anybody who has been following that , the whales decide when it goes up or down, and that this is not forecast anywhere. There are far too many scammers out there (some who genuinely believe the bs they are spewing ) who are now making money on YouTube with their false predictions. So worst comes to worst, they still made their YouTube money. We need less of.these charts on Reddit or any forums , because people fall for it. And Bitcoin being set up as the daddy of.orher cryptos ensures that all other coins stay mute just as long as Bitcoin does. Bitcoin itself is a scam by the elites to bankrupt the average man even further since the grand exposure to the masses was when Bitcoin was when Bitcoin was reaching the top , that's when most "masses" decided to join and lose all their money. I genuinely believe it will keep going down . And down , and down.. for the next while 
@_date: 2018-12-11 12:26:23
Bitcoin will go up, when the average man has lost most of his money and is not interested to go in again, leaving the market to the whales. That's when Bitcoin will go up. Probably in the next year sometime or even 2 years from now. Most people have lost most of their money by now, but still are keeping it . 
@_date: 2018-12-11 12:02:38
Why would it be a reversal just because you want it to? These dumb ass charts prove nothing , only that you can draw lines going up or down. Have the thousands of charts that people drew over the last year by the "experts" been correct? Pretty fucking opposite to what reality showed to be honest. I've followed quite a few of these "experts" and everything they said was bullshit. They still made their YouTube money though. 
@_date: 2019-05-10 18:51:23
I'm not sure what's going on but in 2017 the alt coins would follow bitcoin , a few hours behind. Now I see the alt coins are completely separated and not going up with bitcoins except if bitcoin goes down then they follow that pattern. 
What's going on here i feel scammed . It's like they knew everybody put their money into alt  coins in 2017 when they noticed a pattern, and now that pattern cannot be repeated and instead the altcoins are sinking in value ad bitcoun goes up. This is completely opposite of 2017 and how can this be ?
