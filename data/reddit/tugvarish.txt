Let's see if I have got the compatibility quirks of P2SH and Bech32 correct:
With a P2SH address I can receive coins from legacy (non SegWit), P2SH SegWit (... obviously) and Bech32; also I can send to legacy and P2SH, but not Bech32.
With a Bech32 I can receive only from Bech32, but can send to all three of them.

Thank you I see your point... I was trying to simplify the standing situation.
I understand that since we are programing wallets, and as a piece of code, we can get them to do what we want, but I also thought that certain type of address could, or better should (by convention) contain only a certain type and amount of data, like meta-data, coins type info, addresses, contract, colored coins, underpinned token, etc and also specified using different schema.
Am I wrong about that?

I proposed since the beginning of BTC Futures offering, that it was actually a really bad thing, because allows Big Fiat to manipulate and control the actually BTC price from outside.
It is infact since the creation of BTC Future at the end of 2017 that Big Fiat was able to enter the BTC market and "funny enough" BTC crashed just few months after.
Even now every time real investors bring the demand (and price) up, there are large short positions in the Futures pressuring the price back down.
BTC should not be in Futures! Since it's not a Future asset, like food, metals, etc. it does not depends on natural, or measurable events... So at least for now who has power over legacy news and large amount of Fiat is controlling it's indexes.
Absolutely stupid for BTC be in that market.

There is no saying that a "Non-Persistent Live OS" would be more safe... it still can get hacked "live" from boot to shutdown/reboot, especially if it is not up to date, for your very saying patching is important, and that cannot be done on a live OS that is not persistent... so you have to create a new CD/USB/etc. every-time a vulnerability and new version is out.
Do you think your theoretical noob would go that far if it did not go as far as leave auto-update on?

Now I'm 100% sure that you are mistaking, and start posting too many misconceptions as real, so let's rectify and state some facts:
There are multiple ways to possibly execute a Double Spend.
All the attack you are enlisting, including the one you think I'm referring to, which I'm not, need some hashing power.
The one that others and myself were mentioning above, to do the Double Spend, it actually does not need hashing power and it's a type of Race Attack; it uses speed (and even something else, I will not discuss here) in place of power.
@_date: 2018-06-07 13:59:31
Wow I think your question started a much larger debate than you would expect.
I also noticed some people here erroneously believe in quite few misconceptions.
... this is to be good...

Err on the side of caution.
@_date: 2018-06-07 13:50:13
I think you mistaking again... nobody is taking about mining... 51% attack, they are talking about double spend attack, which is mainly done on the transfer/receiving side, not the validation side.
@_date: 2018-06-19 06:24:49
Good job!
@_date: 2018-06-07 14:10:47
First, earlier and later does not matter that much, it matters which transaction get in the block, if any... since it could also be cancelled before confirmation.
Second, a system could be devised that the double spend attack happens at the same time... and even to add some more engineered esoteric complications.
@_date: 2019-06-04 07:53:07
Not really, in the US and many other country, there are already freeways where you have to pay the toll to use them.
@_date: 2019-08-24 12:45:10
Actually any good wallet can do that, you still would need some copy of the blockchain data.
With no block data and just the pub key you can verify that a transaction was made and signed by the proper priv key.
Passing the raw transaction to a "tool" that has the blockchain data you can verify and also see what the transaction is. 
P. S.:
If it really need to be offline, maybe this could be at your alley:

It goes into an eternal loop... kind of like Portal.
And if enough people are doing it, the whole crypto system will come to an halt.

Fungibility is the property of one been the perfect substite for another, because of been absolutely equal, like a type of money without any distinguishable markings/characteristics, including serials and dates, but still valid; or like a block of precious metal would  be absolutely equal to another block of the same metal.

Most of the time they only have to shill until the next voting, which it's at least every month if not more often.
So if you get 2 to 10 every month, those "extra bonuses" actually add up quickly to a very large number... by the end of the year you could have made millions.

I see your point, but I'm also not sure about it:
Miles do not increase/decrease in value, but Bitcoins do... so there is a possible gain/loss event.
I'm sure that if there was a card that gives you stocks, you would have to pay capital gain.
As well as there was a card giving you equity in real estates you would have to pay property taxes.

Possible, but I don't remember ever happening in the past and discussing about that same subject with some other programmers, it seemed to us that diff-up quickly moves to parameter easier then diff-down.
So diff adjusting downward seems unlikely in a convenient time-frame.

Never ever get caught doing something illegal without ready available large amount of cash.
When I was younger, some of my friends and I went there few times for holidays and one time one of the hardcore party type thought it was cool, on the last day, to get some "candy" of some kind to get high before the flight... Well he got busted by the police... with cash he could have bought his way out, but instead he spent 3 year in their prisons and his family spent 100 of thousands to bring him back home... he was risking a life sentence.

The paper you are linking is an update to this paper ( by the same author.
Those Andrew Poelstra paper are just bunch of nonsense jibber jabber, that seem created by his desperate need for publication: just because he learned the proper format to create academic whitepapers it does not means they can hold any ground; Here an example of a perfectly formatted and proper looking whitepaper with charts and references that is just a spoof: 
His papers on anything not Bitcoin are just a sample of partisan attack and written fictional narrative, with obvious pre-sold artifact and very doubtful, if any, referenced facts. 
Poelstra is a good short stories fictional writer, OK at programming in C and making simple bicycle amplifiers, but a mediocre computer scientist and a even less valuable cryptologist: 
Anyway the original paper was debunked many times, by multiple people, in multiple publications; here is Vitalik Buterin proving the feasibility of PoS ( just after the original paper was published.
Also to both Poelstra papers, here you can see the TLDR answer, the full whitepaper answer and a bounty: 
If Polestra is so certain, why does he not take the bounty? Because his conjectures are just nonsense.

I definitely think Gridcoin Research would be the most disruptive:
At the beginning with Gridcoin Classic entering the scene, it was already the only coin trying to use a good part of Computer time/electricity to do something useful and instead of requiring more and more power for "useless" hashing they were doing Boinc scientific work.
Now with Gridcoin 2.0 aka Gridcoin Research at least 99% of the Computer time/electricity is used for productive useful scientific work and since the new groundbreaking algorithm, called PoR, is actually based on the scientific work produced, the participants are getting compensated for it with the GRC currency.
I think with the help of Konify funding the developer could get help refining the edges...
This intrinsic capabilities derivative by the Gridcoin/Boinc marriage, which is already using a type of dApps, plus the smart contracts and DAC built in... from which you can see the possibilities are limitless and some are already in use, will push the boundaries of what is possible with a cryptocoin.
The community will greatly benefit from the success of this coin, in more ways that can be foresee; to start it is proving that one of the main problem of cryptocurrencies, the waste of energy, is obsolete and it is doing that while helping advance world science, medicine, technology... etc.
Just check it out. And give it a spin:

Actually, since its creation BTC gained value.
But if you are interested why BTC lost so much value recently, and what could possible caused it... well too me it seems obvious that it was since they pushed BTC into the Futures market... so again not the Feds, but still the very system that will also effects Now prices by creating, in this case unfounded fictitious believed and rumours about that asset, since there is no base to speculate on its future value same you do with sugar, etc. And on top of it it's in the hands of large players: institutions, governments, banks etc.
Everything that enter Futures will lose value if it is a very fast moving asset, and may gain value if very slow moving asset... so it's the wrong place for any crypto.
That is simple and logic. So take BTC of Futures and price will improve greatly.
