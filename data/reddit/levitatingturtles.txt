No... the blockchain is the internet;  Bitcoin is America online.

Tell you what... if you want to replace gold with bitcoin, I will be more than happy to hold onto all that extra gold that you don't need anymore.  More than happy.

Yet items on that site are priced in $USD.  How odd...
Edit: lists discount if paid in BTC.  Would rather see price in BTC with surcharge for paying in $USD.  :-)

Yep.  CC and Bank account both denied.  No response from support.

I refuse to donate to so many worth causes because of this.  Whenever I do, I can count on 2-3 years of getting useless donation requests in the mail.  
ACLU... I'm looking at you.  Good forkening lord... so much mail.  
Planned Parrenthood, NPR, PBS, and on and on and on.  If they would put up a QR code, I would donate.
Edit: I should add that they consider this personal information that they extract from you to be of value.  In some cases, just having your name and address and knowing that you are willing to donate to their cause provides potential for years of additional donations.  This is one reason that a non-profit could actually oppose bitcoin donations.  Yes, they are getting a one-time donation that they might not otherwise get.  However, by allowing many many people to donate anonimously, they may be losing out on a stream of future donations by some fraction of donors because they lose the ability to remind people to donate again in the future.  Just a thought.

I had a CC denied and a bank account deposit denied.  Both for small amounts, open/valid accounts, etc.
Also had trouble verifying my bank account information.  They deposited two amounts and I had to leave the decimal places off the values in order to get it accepted.
Tried to submit the information vai their web form.  Denied.  500 character limit.  So, like, I'm done with circle for today.  
Will try again tomorrow.  I'm happy to tolerate growing pains, but I'm done for today.  :-(

I heard you!  I was so proud!  You were concise and correct.  I'm going to use your line about suing cash.  :-)

ASICs can't mine ETHASH.
