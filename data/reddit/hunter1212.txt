@_date: 2016-08-02 22:07:48
it will go up in the long run but we will test 500.00 b4 that happens maybe within a few hours when china wakes up 
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:05:53
coinbase is safe and sound 
@_date: 2016-08-02 05:48:59
went out at 626.00 this a.m. looking for a lower price still b4 re entering looks to be  still going lower and margin call selling could be huge 
@_date: 2016-08-14 19:14:27
quick and easy at circle 
@_date: 2016-08-17 14:50:17
circle or coinbase is best 
@_date: 2016-08-03 07:03:37
I hope they have things fixed by then 
@_date: 2016-08-16 14:54:34
coinbase works great 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:28:44
that's not good 
@_date: 2016-08-17 15:39:30
That's great :) 
@_date: 2016-08-15 02:31:21

@_date: 2016-08-21 23:27:23
coinbase works too but the wait time for email response can be a lot longer I don't think they can keep up with the volume at this time 
@_date: 2016-08-02 15:17:43
no eth and etc are in free fall 
@_date: 2016-08-12 01:41:00

@_date: 2016-04-12 22:42:52
I have used this site for 2 years plus and get paid bitcoins daily, its the best 
   .
@_date: 2016-04-13 21:43:58
maybe explain or remove, relocate, block height and mining numbers.  That  is  not something easy to explain and newbies will be confused by them 
@_date: 2016-04-02 19:20:09
hope they fix it soon
@_date: 2016-04-25 01:40:35
@_date: 2016-04-14 02:23:47
try circle for a quick purchase 
@_date: 2016-04-20 19:18:38

@_date: 2016-04-06 02:36:56

This is the best way to get free bitcoins. pays you every 24 hours for small tasks  
@_date: 2016-04-13 21:24:13
maybe add the estimated date of the halving 
@_date: 2016-08-27 20:19:33
coinbase gets 2 to 5 thousand new users per day
 so you are mistaken 
@_date: 2016-04-26 06:37:54
Try  doing tasks and surveys on this website to earn some bitcoins But get a coinbase or circle wallet first to get started   
@_date: 2016-04-02 22:24:09
@_date: 2016-04-13 22:27:14

It was around 3.1 / 3.2 million users  on Jan 1 2016 now we are at 5.7 million users about 13 months later
 If they have around 10% of all bitcoins out there at coinbase that's aprox  .36 bitcoins per account wallet.... Interesting 
@_date: 2016-03-05 15:00:38
looks like the end is near now wow major selling going on today

@_date: 2016-01-10 02:17:08
that's great :)
@_date: 2016-01-25 00:03:15
As soon as people stop using cash payments, banks will have complete control over user’s finances at all times. Consumers and businesses need to look at digital alternatives, such as Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-03-29 00:00:17
this is one giant pennet that's about 5 months old on the daily chart 
@_date: 2016-01-07 03:21:14

@_date: 2016-03-17 17:26:02

@_date: 2016-01-25 20:40:53

@_date: 2016-01-11 12:31:27

@_date: 2016-03-08 15:19:00

@_date: 2016-01-16 13:46:03
ya I got that trash 
@_date: 2017-02-08 21:08:30
Maybe the increase is due to the fact that circle is not a player anymore ?
@_date: 2016-01-13 23:42:21
I would like 1 million bitcoins :) 
@_date: 2016-01-26 18:42:16

@_date: 2016-01-25 12:38:57
Hello , Any idea of how many new users come to bitcoin each day?
@_date: 2016-01-29 01:50:46
correct china correction 
@_date: 2016-01-16 19:39:14
so why did  they not give a reason?
@_date: 2016-01-26 02:06:58
that's so cool ;) 
@_date: 2016-01-27 13:11:19
yes it would :)
@_date: 2016-01-18 16:58:40
I will be out  of all stocks by the close of the market Tuesday and will boost my bitcoin holdings
@_date: 2017-03-31 11:28:30
@_date: 2016-01-05 12:49:04
I earn them on this website 
@_date: 2016-01-18 18:34:14
a killer app :)
@_date: 2016-01-01 16:23:29
I would use the post office again if I could pay with Bitcoin 
@_date: 2016-01-18 16:09:15
buy and spend bitcoin for them
@_date: 2017-03-19 03:24:09
sorry to says its not over yet 
@_date: 2016-01-01 18:35:33

@_date: 2016-03-05 14:36:03
not the article the posters
@_date: 2016-01-18 17:46:00
price will rise alot as money comes of  the market 
@_date: 2016-01-27 23:16:16
because there are no fees from bitcoin like the fees the credit card companys charge and I just closed my last credit card and will never have one again :) so you want my check cash or Bitcoin that's it 
@_date: 2016-01-12 18:28:35
I got more bitcoins today :) 
@_date: 2016-01-22 17:44:10
wish I could be there :(

and now the slide resumes from 1012.12
@_date: 2016-01-07 03:25:36
if they can get the money out of the market some will buy Bitcoins 
@_date: 2016-01-05 21:47:26
ok who is  next ? what country will fail next ? 
@_date: 2016-01-13 23:45:36

coinbase is ok but everyone seems to have problems there but no lost funds
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:10:55
How correct you are  I referd 5 people and all 5 had major problems opening a new account and 2 of them gave up and said its not worth the problems due to poor customer support a loss to coinbase but a bigger loss to Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:58:26
I like  this thank you :)

@_date: 2016-07-25 13:36:59

@_date: 2016-07-10 01:33:11
Coinbase needs to respond to emails quicker and with alot more details for people understand and help fix issues without us they are nothing 
@_date: 2015-03-12 23:41:21
great idea 
@_date: 2016-07-20 17:58:29

@_date: 2016-07-17 02:19:00
There is a major car dealership in the boston Mass area that takes bitcoins for new car purchases they are listed in coinmap 
@_date: 2016-07-10 23:54:53
they both should be avoided and direct bitcoin investments only 
@_date: 2016-07-24 22:35:15
they should of refunded you the bitcoins on the spot 
@_date: 2015-02-27 11:53:35

@_date: 2016-07-29 20:46:56

@_date: 2016-07-16 14:29:22
circle needs to inform the people 
@_date: 2016-07-31 01:58:31
they are hurting bitcoin at a time that it needs to grow more first  So the timing on this is  bad an should of ben put off another year or 2 
@_date: 2016-07-16 14:29:02
coinbase needs to inform the people 
@_date: 2016-07-11 00:56:40
gold and silver would be alot higher if not for foolish fake traded etfs fake paper b.s
@_date: 2016-07-31 03:05:09

@_date: 2016-07-31 03:08:45

@_date: 2017-06-15 15:19:53

@_date: 2016-07-04 20:00:27
