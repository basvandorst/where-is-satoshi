Or alternatively move out of the US. Problem solved.

This doesn't sound anything like a scam, and I don't understand why the OP would want sympathy. If people are going to invest in Goxcoin they will be doing so because they think it might be a good investment.
This is not an unashamed request for donations. It is instead an attempt by someone who has most likely lost a large amount of money to try and make a small amount of it back, and to try and help others in the process.

So this is your way of trying to clear your conscience? It is pathetic. You can keep the money and the guilt.

Thanks for letting everyone know how clever you are.

However the latter is a stupid question. If people who had money at Gox had known that it had a shady and incompetent past they would quite clearly not have kept their money there. It often feels like people make the latter statement just to boost their own egos.
The people who lost money were those who invested in Bitcoin without being regular users of Bitcoin forums or Reddit. Without the extra knowledge from these forums MtGox appears safe. It was the most well known exchange, was easy to use, and even boasted of its security. Just because the investors did not use the forums it does not make them stupid.

Will the mtgoxrecovery lawsuit cover claimants from all parts of the world (I am from the UK)? Is it possible that claimants will get different payouts depending on which class action lawsuit they sign up to?

Might be worth adding GBP as an option for recording fiat losses on the recovery webpage. Personally I only lost BTC but I believe quite a few Brits had GBP desposited there.

Your mum would be proud.

Really sorry to hear your story. I also lost a large sum of money, though not quite as much as you.
I was looking to move my coins too. I applied for verification in November. After some chasing-up my account was finally verified in mid-january. I should have moved my coins immediately. 2 weeks was too long to wait.
Who knows, maybe the stolen coins will be considered stolen property? Maybe anyone receiving one of these coins will be handling stolen goods? Maybe if they can be traced the law will decide that it is up to BTC users to check whether the BTC they receive have been reported as stolen? Maybe software will be created that can detect whether a BTC is one of those stolen from Gox.
That is the kind of thinking which stops me beating my head against a wall.

Even if you are 90% sure it is a scam it would surely be sensible to refrain from making such a comment.

...and I automatically downvote those who automatically downvote.
@_date: 2014-03-07 22:21:38
Does anyone know if this is actually the legal standpoint? Could it be the case that the stolen bitcoins will be seen by the law as stolen property? If so then presumeably anyone in possession of them would be liable for handling stolen goods? Not saying, just wondering...
