Thank you!

I've been waiting for a good dip.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:49:52
Why? The lower it goes, the more you can afford.

Thank you! I'll check it out!
*EDIT*: This app is great and I highly recommend it.

Meaning he would've got $500, $4,000, or $15,000 for a $15 bag of weed.

Bruh, Quora has been cited. The argument is over.

The fact that it's *valued* at nearly $10k per coin would say otherwise.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:21:19
I'm the only one finding this completely unbelievable?
Even the day Bitcoin was released and anyone would have known anything about it the open price point was roughly 7 cents. Times 500 that's $35, more than twice the dollar amount of weed stipulated here. A year later it was worth $31 per coin or $15,500 for 500.
At any point, either the friend in this scenario was an idiot or was.

It's not "logic," it's called an "opinion."
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:36:17
Definitely time to start exploring options.

Over two weeks! Who knows how long I'll be waiting this time!

It also took over two weeks for these deposits to finally show up in my account. There's no excuse for that. In the meantime, I have nowhere to deposit USD.
@_date: 2013-04-14 15:52:58
Yeah, but then it'd be worth $200 by the time you went back to return it.

Bitcoin as a viable currency keeps growing in appeal with every incident like this. These companies are undermining their own viability.
@_date: 2013-04-14 00:18:41
Yeah, that stuck out to me, too. I've done the Moneygram/BitInstant thing, but I've never seen traditional giftcards.
@_date: 2013-04-14 00:16:27
Surely I did; it was a copy/paste. That is my plural preference as well.
@_date: 2013-04-14 00:15:11
That burn is going to require ointment.

I've followed some enormous Bitcoin transactions in the block chain and wondered what powerhouses could be behind such massive purchases. We've got at least two answers now.
@_date: 2013-04-14 04:32:21


Exactly. There's a unnecessary middle-man and Walmart could easily take that out of the equation, make their own profit, and create Bitcoin awareness while they're at it.
