Yeah. I opened an account at Mt. Gox in 2013 with the intent to buy.  Ran into some minor problem and gave up.  Maybe I'd be a crypto-millionaire today if I had made the purchase.  Or maybe I would have left it in the exchange and lost it all.

Well.. OP removed his comment. I'm going to leave this here, either OP was using this strategy on purpose or.. by natural talent. 
"Machine learning expert and Microsoft researcher Cormac Herley suggests in a paper released yesterday that "by sending an email that repels all but the most gullible the scammer gets the most promising marks to self-select."
Herley's reasoning is that scammers have to go to a lot of effort to successfully extract money from their victims. "At the interface between the digital and physical worlds effort must often be spent," he writes. "Each respondent to a Nigerian 419 [advance fee fraud] email requires a large amount of interaction...each potential target represents an investment decision."
The most profitable way to earn money through email scams, Hurley finds, is to only invest in those targets most likely to pay out, rather than maximising the number of targets "attacked". This is why 419 emails contain fabulous stories that most people find laughable - or that savvy internet users will see through with a quick search or based on their experience."

And for those who missed it, OP was promising 0.5 Bitcoin per day for free, no strings attached...

It's just a private key and matching Bitcoin address printed on a piece of paper. Having an address lets you receive Bitcoin, and knowing the matching private key lets you spend it.
OP would print the paper wallet, then send some Bitcoin to the address shown on the paper.  The recipient could then use the private key to "spend" the Bitcoin, which in this case means just moving it into a wallet.  This would eliminate OP's (and anyone else who saw the paper wallet's) access to the funds.
 You could picture a software wallet as a stack of paper wallets.

Indeed, I too feel part of Sir Wallcarpeting's bicameral zoo of drunkards.

Slow.  My exchange needs 7 confirmations for bitcoin deposits.  I got my first confirmation almost 2 hours ago, and it looks like at least another hour to go before I have access to the funds.  Crazy.

I saw the same thing on a digital sign on 9th ave this morning.  I'm not sure exactly what they are advertising for.

If you're anything like me, the next step is to buy $300 worth of bitcoin.

All of this is true.  The artificial manipulation and creation of money is a tax on everyone.  But is it different from any other tax?  Isn't this the price we pay to give governments some control over domestic economies, which (like all other government powers) we hope and expect they use for the good of the people?
I'm not against central banks any more than I'm against the military.  Both are capable of great harm as well as acting for the common good.  "The rich get richer" happens as a result of capitalism, not central banks. 
Anyway, my 2 cents.  I believe there is a huge need for a decentralized worldwide currency like Bitcoin, but not as a replacement for national currencies.

I'll second the recommendation for Quadriga. No issues at all.
