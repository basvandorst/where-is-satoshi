I dont know man, bought at almost ATH, lost 50% while hodling. I spend my weekends listening to Adele while my wife despises me.

Any service that's still functioning?

Well before that came Segwit etc etc...and nothing much changed. We’ll see. The issue is that many arent going to trust an asset that can depreciate 50% in a month. It’s fun for speculative purposes, but if the average guy cant trust it in the long run it’s, well, worthless. I think projects like Tether will be much more successful in the long run, but alot has to change. 
Blockchain is now developed by nerds with no actual connection to reality, and yeah, I get how amazing it is to have a ledger and so on. But it’s not like banks are losing track of our money all the time (the opposite, if you loose your wallet), nor that all of them are evil and want to rob you. A decent MVP for a crypto currency would need ATMs, widespread payment gateways and, most of all, actual stability of value. I guess only time will tell

Yeah right some people bought at ATH, ask them what they think about vision :) Cut your losses guys, dont get brainwashed
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:04:41
I mean, you were the one coming in thread with a very insighful comment that read “Fuck em” so yeah, I guess I’m staying. Also, cut the emo teenage angst about approval. It’s not about approval, it’s about having people not ruining themselves over mantras.

Well it’s not like you arent one of them, you’ve been obnoxiously bragging about your earnings everywhere.
Many people used Bitcoin as a store of value because of geopolitical reasons. I guess fuck em too right?

One thing is expecting returns, the other is loosing 10-20-30% of your earnings day after day.
As I said before, I hope you’ll learn to be humble, looks like it wont take long.

I just said “Cut your losses” lol man, chill out.
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:58:29
Also, why didnt you link your other posts mentioning “Why should you invest in Bitcoin even if it’s a bubble” and so on? Just look at your history. Give us a break.
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:23:19
Ooohoho dont you worry
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:51:42
Lol how old are you?
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:21:56
It’s one of its trumpeted features. I know i know.
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:19:34
This is why cryptos such as these are doomed to speculation, and we badly need a stable coin tethered to fiat.
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:28:41
The problem is that right now this amazing tech is basically useless.
No major retailer accepts it, Stripe removed support, buying is easy yet selling sometimes isnt, tx fees can be harsh, plastic cards were closed, there were quite a few scams and value is highly volatile.
Someday, once the ecosystem is settled and value isnt as volatile it will be amazing, but right now it’s mainly a toy for the few that want to make it better and the many that want to earn a quick buck
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:40:19
Yeah right, just because you bet on the good horse now you pity those poor bastards that came in after. 
How can you be so meanspirited?
Too bad it’s because of them that you got some return on it, and not because you grew money on trees.
I hope that you learn what its like to loose, looks like it wont take long.
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:27:15
I dont get why, if you talked about the need for a better store of value, and I also did, mentioning why people expecting to store their value should cut their loss atm, your reply was “Fuck em”.
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:15:59
Guess we’ll wait for your advice like “HODL” and “TO THE MOOONN”, that looks legit.
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:09:25
Your original reply just said “Fuck em”, full stop. No arguments, nothing. Like, people are actually loosing lots of money over this, and your reply was literally “fuck em”. Dont turn this around, you’re the one trolling.

You can’t be sure it will go up “more than gold”, as that assumption requires quite a few leaps of faith in technology and market. Also, Btc can be anonymous but is still completely traceable, while gold is both anonymous AND untraceable, and dont get me wrong, I’m super excited about cryptos, but the track record from value retention of BTC actually sucks compared to gold. Even Rolexes have less fluctuations and are to this point more of an investment for fund keeping and foreshadowing. It clearly isn’t meant as a currency but they serve different purposes. Keeping depends on the user. If you’re legit you buy gold options and hold to those, if you’re not then at 50.000 dollars per kilogram it’s not that difficult to hide a few bricks :)

I sure as hell am keeping my gold
@_date: 2019-05-02 08:46:29
Let’s put it this way: it has never gone down in price in the history of mankind and it works without needing internet or electricity for that matter. I deeply appreciate crypto and hate fiat but gold is gold, you cant go wrong with that
