For crying out loud, milli bits are just going to end up with to much value (if they don't already) and we'll have to switch AGAIN to micro bits.  Just switch now to micro bits and call it a day.  We'll save ourselves headaches in the long run.  Besides, assuming the value continues to rise, I personally would rather be paying in hundreds or thousands of micro bits than fractions of a milli bit.

yes, ideally for btc to develop some resilience against foreign policy in individual countries, it needs a larger user base spread out over diverse regions.  but the next very likely "hot zone" that's going to trigger a bubble is India, followed in my opinion by the whole Indonesia/Polynesia (Oceania?) region.

I have had the same problem, it forced me to pay a 50 cent fee to transfer 10 dollars.  I was extremely mad because it was to another one if my own wallets.

I don't know which one you're referring to, but the point I wanted to make was that you're being incredibly unfair to your friends if you're living off their kindness.  They are the ones having the headaches you mentioned keeping their home in order, while you just keep mooching of them.  I'm not saying you need to own your own home, but if you don't want to have to deal with broken shit, renting is a fine option; shit breaks?  Call the landlord.  Just my unsolicited two cents.

As a miner, the amount we earn from fees is miniscule in comparison to mining a single block (usually ranging from .03 to .1 btc per block, .4% of the 25 you earn from a block).  It's not that I don't want to tip miners, it's that for me to move MY money from one wallet to another, why am I being FORCED to pay a minimum fee?  One of the whole claims to fame that the bitcoin protocol enables is the lack of mandatory fees, which seems to no longer be the case.
And again, the main reason I'm angry about this is because in the past, I've transferred money from one of my wallets to another without any fees.  Again, it took over 6 hours to transfer, but I don't care about that.  If I was transferring money to another person, I wouldn't be so miffed about the fee, I just feel like this is the same as a bank charging you an ATM fee.

Fair enough, then get to work already!  :P
But yeah, I'd say buy some, put out through a tumbler, sell them on an exchange, buy new ones, call it a day (without withdrawing any of your fiat so it never shows anywhere except on the exchange).  If anyone asks, you bought some with cash back when they were worth 50 cents.  You can withdraw and pay taxes from there in my opinion, and as long as you give the government their share, they are probably not going to bother you.

Eh, all mining hardware preorders are a gamble these days.  I would have been better off spending my money on bitcoins instead of my own BFL hardware, but I got mine a month or two ago, recouped my initial investment (in USD) in less than a month, and then sold it for about double what I paid (1300 back before they raised prices and lowered hashrates).  I was still able to come out ahead a bit, so I'm not too upset, though the wait for them to work through their backlog of orders was painful.
I think all their problems come from poor management.  From the way they handled bad press and general lack of professionalism to their complete lack of understanding of the time frame of manufacturing a chip, they don't seem to have a good handle on anything and give off vibes of amateurs faking it until they make it.  I think they have good intentions, but terrible execution.
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:58:20
it still forces a minimum fee of .0001 btc per kb of transaction data.

10 minutes is the goal for the average time it takes to discover a block.  you can find 30 blocks in 10 minutes, and then the next one take 24 hours.  the network will adjust the difficulty to match the hashing power, and self correct if we're finding blocks too fast or too slowly.
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:59:13
Using QT, I had set the fee to .00005, and it requested a minimum of .0003, then after trying again, .0002.  
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:17:10
i said essentially impossible, not actually impossible.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:51:31
yes, there is the possibility.  i pretty much asked the same question a short while back, and the official term is a collision.  search bitcoin collision and you'll see plenty of talk about it.  It IS possible, it's just such a horrendously small possibility.


true.  but there are only 6 billion of us on Earth.  If every single one of those 6 billion people (including infants, elderly, and people without internet access) had 1000 wallets, that's still only 6e+12 wallets.  That's 1.5e-63 percent of all available wallets (it looks like this: 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000015%)
So yes, you're right, your chances DO go up.  But it's still such a small number, generating wallets to see if there is anything in them will cost more in electricity than it's worth, and you probably wouldn't even find a single wallet with anything in it before you died.  And if you did find a wallet, how many wallets actually house more than .1 coin?  Probably very few.
edit:  regarding a list of addresses with coins, that's literally what the blockchain is.  i'm sure there is some way you could query the database to generate a list of addresses with more than x number of btc, but that's still a useless list for anyone with nefarious plans unless they feel like trying to brute force the private key.
edit2: every single potential wallet technically "exists" already.  it's just a matter if people decided to send coins to that public key already.
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:40:52
what purpose would a bitcoin bank serve?  
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:42:37
Right, but ideally I'd imagine you'd want to move a large chunk of coins all at once from the FBI account, lest the transaction history give you away while stealing slowly from the main FBI account.  Then if someone spends them "legally" (through some online vendor or something), it's not too hard for the feds to trace it back.  And no amount of "splintering" as you put it will ever make it impossible to tack.  The only possibility would be to try and sell them anonymously on craigslist or something like that, get them entirely out of your hands, then buy fresh coins with the money you made selling your dirty ones.

@_date: 2013-12-10 19:57:17
No way to avoid the public ledger part, just to obfuscate the coin origins.  Again, selling on an exchange and rebuying would be a great way to get fresh coins though.  They can track those new coins to whatever wallets they want, none of them were (probably) ever in any of yours.  Also, if course you want new wallets each time, and to not transfer all the coins at once.  Break things down as small as you can manage and don't make patterns in the data (three wallets each sent about 25 coins to this other wallet, or each day at this time, 25 coins moved out of this wallet, etc).  Smaller chunks means less likely to be looked at and more data that needs to be analyzed, making it less and less worth it for LE.

@_date: 2013-12-05 16:59:06
I've been able to set it to zero, but when you go to send, it mandates .0001 btc/kb of transaction data, regardless of what you set the tip to.
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:16:40
you're certainly right to a degree, but they still have the ability to purchase them from someplace like craigslist or localbitcoins anonymously.  i think that making it difficult to obtain large amounts of btc anonymously is generally good, as long as there are still ways to obtain them anonymously, if need be.  however anonymous exchanges will only continue to feed people's fears that this currency's utility is relegated to the black market, and won't help spread bitcoin as a legitimate currency.
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:14:27

@_date: 2013-12-10 16:55:32
i don't think it's easy enough to purchase LARGE quantities of btc outside of exchanges.  assuming your "box of cash" is worth at least 100k, you'd have to make a lot of smaller purchases at a time, though it's still possible.  Just not super easy.
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:20:12
i'm saying no anonymity on exchanges.  i think btc should be able to be traded anonymously between people, but you can't have large exchanges which are in the public eye (and most certainly the government's) turning a blind eye to laundering.  this won't help btc gain any legitimacy whatsoever.  
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:25:51
I am not up on Indian policy either, but they are a MUCH more open country than China, and I'd be very surprised if they tried to ban the use of rupees to purchase btc.  I could always reach out to a couple of my friends over there and see what they think...

I was originally thinking this would be more useful for an offline, cold storage wallet/paperweight.  Or maybe if you wanted to put a permanent address out in the public for donations or similar (maybe with an art installation or something, I really don't know what market I'd be pushing this towards lol).
The problem with BTC jewelry would be that I can't cast very small objects well.  The hot metal kind of flows like water on a hydrophobic surface; it doesn't "wet" the mold so you end up with air pockets unless you're using some kind of pressure to force the metal into the mold (not going to happen with my setup anytime soon).  On top of that, I also don't have a crucible for precious metals, and if I did, the risk of me potentially messing up something up when pouring gold and ruining several hundred dollars of precious metal scares me, though I do think it's a good idea.  I'll have to see what I can do.  Thanks for the feedback!

anyone who has a btc china account is heavily invested enough that they aren't going to be driven away by this.  however how are people going to get fiat transferred if the only bank that would let them refuses?  sure, paths may open up eventually, but i can't imagine that happening within a few days.
and who cares if they blame me?  i'm just some idiot on the internet spouting bad ideas.  who is the bigger fool, the fool or the one who follows the fool?  anyone with any sense would realize that this plan would require the price to drop on BTC China, and if you don't believe it will, don't get involved, i was merely putting this idea out there since i'm not able to take advantage of what i believe the market over there will do.

yes, but if the exchange is unable to have new fiat put in, the number of buyers will eventually dry up and the price will plummet.  also, in a country with an oppressive gov't like China's, how likely would you be to try and skirt rules like this?  I personally would join the panic sell and get my cash out of there while I still could.

Just got 2 confirmations now in less than 10 minutes (so obviously yes, showing in my wallet).  I didn't pay a fee, I thought it was up to the sender to pay the fee?

Right, of course.  It's possible to do, just requires a fair bit of legwork.  I think this balance between exchanges providing easy ways to move large amounts of money with account holder verification vs places like craigslist providing anonymity but harder to move large sums of money is perfect for bitcoin.  It prevents rampant laundering without stifling the black market.
I just think it's going to be hard to find people with 10, 50, 100k in btc they want to sell on CL.  I remember seeing some miner posting in NYC looking to sell large quantities though, perhaps you should give that area a search or look for miners out by you looking to sell.
