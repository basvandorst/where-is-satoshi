you dont get the joke because youre new to purse.io (and btc apparently) and thats fine. even if you werent involved any fraud just giving any credence to purse typically gets you shit on and down voted to oblivion here since fraud is their underlying business model. and its ok youre a lady, youre still my bro, bro

in fact, they made a big deal of saying that it did happen then failed to produce evidence that it happened. then continued to refer to it as an uncharged crime, insinuating the defendant was a violent criminal knowing they could prove no such thing. not saying it didnt happen, not saying it did. but the govt prosecution doesnt appear to be innocent.

@_date: 2015-06-23 16:54:36
i havent thought thru how one might defraud something like swagbucks. i guess on perktv one can earn more with a us ip as opposed to say an ip out of mexico, so thats easy enough. the normal fraud set up on mturk is a little different. if i am legitimately in the us i set up an account and then get a bunch of people in impoverished places (each with a vpn) to work my turk account. i then pay them a fraction of what theyve earned me. honestly i dont care about the moral of the situation and wouldnt care what exposed you to btc, youre here now and thats all that matters. the cc fraud comment was a joke and i was going to add to it something like 'this joke is worth the flak ill catch for making it' but that kind of defeats the purpose. long story short im not that funny. btw you should spread some love over at ever since reddit banned monetized links that place needs some added incentive..

mostly agree. the everything else isnt usually restricted to US only so it doesnt really apply. you can perhaps divide the surveys into consumer research and academic. im not giving a total pass to the academics, they are relatively speaking some of the best paying (still pay poorly) requesters. your statement kind of applies to academia too, it is a chain of people getting data that doesnt matter outside of advancing someones career and will never be read outside of academia anyway.

would that prove that ross himself was involved in those chats or made those transactions, or just that someone who had access to dpr accounts etc. (ie one of the other dprs that the defense claims existed)? i guess im questioning whether the evidence indicates only one person could have resulted in the creation of that evidence? also in general, it just seems odd to have a strong case for murder-for-hire charges against someone and then not pursue a conviction. if the evidence was rolled into a cce charge, but could have stood on its own and garnered a murder-for-hire conviction without expending many more resources, why not get that conviction and not leave yourself open to the attacks my comments highlight. you explanation is pretty good tho, which is why i, like the person i was responding to, equivocated on whether something did or did not happen. perhaps i fall into the same mistake as the person i was responding to originally by implying it hardly matters whether it did or did not happen, the appearance of the possibility alone is bad enough.

holy shit. these are my stomping grounds, though I'm currently out of the country...
RUSH task force, headed by Chris Rush, is a paramilitary organization. I consider them to be criminals (extra-legal). They once kicked down my door and left empty handed. In the process they detained me for hours, destroyed my door and pointed guns at my three month old puppy and threatened to shoot her if I didn't 'shut her up.' They are known to intimidate the populace by doing things like practicing rappelling down the sides of buildings on JMU campus (a local university) in full riot gear. They (and the city) are also in possession of what is essentially a tank, though I think the city council recently demanded that it be sold or given away by a certain date (I'll find the article about this is you guys want). I consider 'task forces' like this to be in violation of Posse Comitatus, especially being familiar first hand with their tactics.
Fuck RUSH task force and fuck Chris Rush!

it's a good thing these little statist hoarder thieves don't have the means to gobble up more bitcoin.
...you do have a point tho.
 it makes sense that young marginalized persons lacking resources would want to hold deflationary currency, so as not to have their savings robbed. then 
again they are male, id guess they fit the construct of white as well, and may not, ultimately, lack access to resources the ways some do. 
tech savvy but poor for now. i do like the idea of network value, or buying into the notion symbolically. i received my first bitcoin for free. it's too 
small even to move, so ill have to find a way to earn more to practice some basics
labor for bitcoin seems like one of the most exciting points to explore, it might especially appeal to young people lacking fiat..

thanks for the quick answer. i had not ever seen something like this, though i should have assumed! i will definitely be looking into this more closely, and i was not at all joking about the post.
another reason i felt this might be expensive is i figured a fee is being paid to whoever runs that fancy looking site, and that fee could (and should) be cut out. i thought this idea would appeal to bitcoin users especially. i would only accept btc payment also, no paypal, ever...
for now, this looks like a great opportunity to earn income while overseas (beats performing HITs hands down). and id be lying if i said i couldnt undercut these prices significantly and still be earning more than i earn at most jobs i work in the place where i was born..

Two questions:
Does blockchain.info android app support the import (or maybe actually sweeping, not entirely sure of the difference) of BIP0038 paper wallets?
When it comes to multisig, can I be more than one of the parties involved? As in, can I be the only person but just set up multiple devices (say my computer, and my phone, and maybe even another phone) with multiple accounts (passwords, individual 2FAs on each) thus enabling something like 4FA or 6FA in a round about way. Or is multisig just applicable to multiple people controlling bitcoins? If the latter, how can I add authorization factors?

sounds like you sort of know what you want to write. i would perhaps examine the possibility that the stickiness of the Bitcoin network itself is undervalued, as is the infrastructure in place / coming up. surely in the valuation-based-on-future-profit calculations of this financial viewership?
as far as i know the protocol itself is open-source, and so i don't know how it grows. perhaps alt-coins claim to have improved upon the protocol, but might not be as sticky, 
alternatively something like dogecoin might be more sticky

aside from properly securing your bitcoin, which the above user addresses.. i think if you're talking about burying your cash to store your value for the long term and avoid government confiscation then you're running up against inflation. in a backhanded way the government can 'confiscate' your 'money' without ever touching it, simply by devaluing it.

while i think you have somewhat of a valid point, it might be a bit of an overstatement to say that this would have the same exact effect. i'm guessing if one compared how the money supply has increased to 1/21, the one would dwarf the other, and it can still grow. in the same vein satoshi shifting coins would be a one-off and they would have done just that, shifted, and nothing more. as i understand it the money supply can be grown and contracted at will, so it isn't exactly the same as satoshi suddenly deciding to sell their coins on the open market. also, im not sure if you're implying that the federal reserve is something other than a mysterious entity whose control is anything but arbitrary.

the validity of the knowledge produced by this poll is suspect at best. the data gathered was self-assessed disclosures. first i qualify my own race (the biggest can of worms that has nothing to do with bitcoin), then without any point of reference i estimate my knowledge on the subject, finally i speculate on the likelihood that i may or may not do something in the future (having already claimed a particular level of intimacy with the subject). they assume their data is sound (tho understanding why what they assume to be true is supposedly true is "a little tricky") and then commence the equivocatin'. remittances? age and use of technology? quien sabe?
where is the poll (which i would be just as eager to dismiss as fundamentally invalid for any number of reasons) that asks who has used bitcoin to date, or seeks to test one's knowledge on the subject? and then categorizes the results according to self-identified race. lol

thanks for posting the info on the philippines. i hear bitcoin is already relatively popular there. i especially like your edit that has info for india. so i think it is safe to say that cost of technology is not an impediment to bitcoin adoption in india, and thus this much talked about firefox phone will not lead to an increase of adoption in india. i guess its only being discussed because mozilla mentioned bitcoin previously. but its kind of sad that this would garner so much unwarranted attention. also, it seems like other obstacles to greater adoption are ignored as a result of hype based articles like this. sounds like education (and of course stability) are bigger issues right now than affordable tech anyway...

How much bitcoin will I receive?
Due to higher than normal buy volumes, we are unable to provide exact price quotes right now.
Instead of pausing buys entirely, we decided to give people the option to purchase bitcoin at the market price in a few days. Once your USD funds arrive, we will exchange them to bitcoin at the market price at approximately Friday Feb 28, 2014 at 04:40PM PST.
Note that you can cancel your order at any time up until your bitcoin arrive from the transfer history page.
The market price of bitcoin changes frequently. Below are some recent prices to give you an idea. These do not guarantee what the price will be in a few days.

i want to again commend you on what youre doing here. like you did with me and nowrouz, youre using an interesting way to educate people about something that im guessing is important to you personally. all of your customers will be exposed to bitcoin. then 1 in 4 of them will get 50% cashback "thanks to" bitcoin. at which point they will research bitcoin and also ask themselves why they didnt pay in btc and save another 20%! well done.

"If income projections were presented to you prior to your enrollment, such projections are not necessarily representative of the income, if any, that you can or will earn through your participation in the Compensation Plan."
 ...they seem to be pretty optimistic!

nothing yet.. what $50 rebate? maybe we arent looking at the same thing. i mostly just want something to hook up to a tv and run xbmc etc so this is actually overkill for me. im more in the market for a tv really, but as long as walmart keeps letting me buy tvs with my wm credit card and then return them 89 days later for a full refund, having only made a few minimum payments on it in the meantime, why switch up the game plan lol

im glad these questions got their own thread and some discussion ensued. kind of frightening tho. not sure if i should sell before a fork, or identify an exchange that will switch and one that wont and be prepared to sweep coins onto both to sell during fork, or just leave coins in cold storage and wait for things to settle...

guessing this will get downvoted but.. are there more details on the encounter with the police? this was irresponsible journalism but was it just that, or did dorian do things like call the cops immediately and make vague statements (and/or have others make vague statements) to get attention? the order of events isnt clear to me by the article and im just wondering.. does he respond in detail about why things went down the way they did or is he just saying he was misunderstood at this point?

Questions about cold storage/paper wallets:
I'm going to move what little I have into cold storage. I was going to follow this guide, though it's a bit old:
I also see this linked below, so I'll review it: 
My main question, besides are the guides above adequate/recommended, is about the printer spool or whatever. If I have just purchased a basic printer will it keep the wallet data anywhere on the printer itself? Do I need to worry about "wiping" the printer? Can I continue to use the printer with an internet connected machine after I do my transfers to cold storage? I gather that I will not need to wipe any spool files on the OS because I am using a thumb drive OS that won't ever touch the internet. Also, is Tails definitely recommended over the latest release of Ubuntu? Thanks in advance for helping!

you mean $25. to get $20 sessions you have to commit to 40 classes! so that part of your statement is 25% misleading. then of course the lessons are only 55 minutes, not an hour, so off by another ~9% there.
all things are relative and subjective. you're right, for most people this probably isnt expensive. perhaps for others looking to earn some btc it simply looks like a job opportunity. i should have phrased my comment differently tho, you're right.

wait, so they were allowed to claim they had 104% of deposits in reserve without ever specifying how many coins that actually was? surely that info is out there, i just cant seem to find it or phrase my question correctly.... how many coins does okc have on deposit?

ok, i appreciate your effort to answer my very moronic question. ill just have to read up on it more and see how it is different than me having one private key for my one paper wallet address. also im intrigued now that multiple private keys can exist per public address and should look more into how one (perhaps more than one) is derived from the other. thanks again!

is there any way to see how much of traders' btc okcoin is holding (or supposedly holding) at a given time? surely at some point there will be a run on okcoin's reserve? id sort of like to watch that unfold. i dont suppose there is such a thing as an orderly run so at some point star is just going to abscond with some of the btc, right?
@_date: 2015-05-31 07:07:42
could you maybe clarify this whole idea of two alt coins for me. so in your example 1/10 blocks are solved by the dying alt coin and 9/10 blocks are solved by what will be the winning coin. does that mean i could spend my coins, and if the block that includes that transaction is mined by the coin that has 10% of miners behind it, then i could turn around and spend my coins again (or hold onto them) and if that block is mined into the other chain then i have effectively spent my coins twice? or what? is there a chance with the scenario you describe where people who arent mining or running nodes, but simply hold coins in cold storage, could somehow lose control of their coins? or do you just mean that rewards for those 1 out of 10 blocks mined by the lesser coin would only exist on that dying chain and thus be less valuable etc etc. sorry i dont even have a good enough understanding to ask my question clearly...

interesting link. i cant tell if this reflects your opinion or... i like the next article linked below that too. so the $78 billion dollars the fed paid the treasury last year sounds like a lot. i wonder tho how much the debt and/or money supply increased in that time. also, it probably isnt a good sign that the fed can pay the treasury more during what are hard times for the average person..

no offense but even if the y-axis on these graphs were numbered this would be meaningless
@_date: 2015-07-30 19:39:06
ah ok, catalyst used a little ambiguously then. if this is all op is trying to show then these graphs are almost assuredly meaningless. for all we know this could be showing that instead of the usual one person searching bitcoin now there are three or four people searching. didnt criticize bitcoin, didnt criticize ops point, i probably agree with his point, just said the graphs he is using to demonstrate whatever it is he is trying to demonstrate are not so useful...
@_date: 2015-07-30 14:53:41
op should have overlayed the trends because what he is probably trying to show is that search numbers in a place like greece spike just before worldwide, but it means little to nothing. one person googling bitcoin in greece doesnt result in ten searching worldwide...

Checked immediately when I saw this headline, also disappointed to not see them signalling yet...
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:43:28
they were signally EC. so if their hash % is 1.4% then this is actually a 2.8% swing. when there is about a 9% difference between EC vs SW hash %, then it is relatively important i would say.
not to mention... why did they change their mind... will others follow suit?
