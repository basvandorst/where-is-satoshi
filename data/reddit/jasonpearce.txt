Avoid using SSL, it’s been depreciated for years. Use TLS, ideally version 1.2 or 1.3.

My thoughts from most to least decentralized.
Mine it:
Spend fiat to buy computers capable of mining bitcoin. More fiat to pay for power, cooling, and internet connectivity.
Earn it:
Do something to earn compensation and ask for the compensation in bitcoin instead of fiat. 
Buy it:
Buying from individuals or a variety of exchanges as you suggested. At one point, Mt Gox was it. Now there are hundreds of on/off ramps. At what quantity would enough on/off ramps be considered decentralized?

Buy GPUs and electricity, then you can mine crypto anonymously.

I used a RockitCoin ATM in Indianapolis this weekend. It required me to provide it a mobile number that it used to send a verification code I had to enter into the machine. It then required me to scan in my driver's license.
If I was able to have a greater degree of privacy, that would have justified the inflated exchange rate and fees. But since I had to provide them my ID like we often have to do on exchanges, it's easier and cheaper to just use Coinbase from the comfort of your own home (in my opinion).

A commenter on my blog made an argument that now makes me think I am in the wrong. If you look at the pictures, some of the screens do have a USD value in the top right. 
Note: What's confusing about my photos is that I took them on two different days: day 1 to find and scout out the machine, day 2 to return to use it.
Ross Airy on my blog commented "almost every picture you show has an exchange rate in the top right hand corner not sure why you are complaining?"
Maybe he's right. I just didn't think the green values of $4,878.19 (taken 1 day earlier when I scouted the ATM out) and $5,326.76 (taken the day I attempted to use the machine) represent the exchange rate. 
After each value its said “We Sell,” which gave me the impression that the value represented the maximum amount of USD they could provide a customer wishing to sell their BTC for USD — not their exchange rate. 
I also didn't think it could have represented the exchange rate because, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), the all-time-high that Bitcoin has even been (ATH) was $5,013.91; which occurred at Saturday, September 2, between 14:00 and 16:00 Eastern. A quote of $5,326 would be just far too high.
But it appears I might be wrong. On my ATM receipt it says that the exchange rate that was used was $5,329.92, which is very close to the $5,326.76 value that was displayed on the screen.
If that top right number is their exchange rate, then I apologize and stand corrected. If so, which I think their quoted exchange rate was unfairly inflated, I did in fact have a chance to cancel my transaction before inserting money. 
I may have misunderstood and apologize.

I've learned that they have an inflated exchange rate. The one I used had a $2 fee plus an exchange rate that was about 12% higher than market value.

I think printer ink is still more expensive than bitcoin.

Additional information. The RockitCoin ATM receipt on 2017-09-02 19:10 (Eastern) reports that the Exchange Rate used was $5329.92. 
The Coinbase candle from 19:00 to 20:00 on 2017-09-02 reports:
* Open:  $4642.39
* High:  $4699.99
* Low:   $4642.39
* Close: $4699.99
Which means that the BTC/USD exchange rate that RockitCoin used was the following percentage higher than what Coinbase experienced in the same hour:
* Open:  14.81 percent higher than Coinbase
* High:  13.40 percent higher than Coinbase
* Low:   14.81 percent higher than Coinbase
* Close: 13.40 percent higher than Coinbase

RockitCoin did provide the option to print the keys. Here's a photo of their machine offering an option to create a paper wallet. I already had a wallet on my phone, so I didn't try the paper wallet option.

Yes they do. I used a RockitCoin machine, which offered the ability to buy or sell Bitcoin and Litecoin.

I did write a retraction at the top of my post and in the comments. And added my comment here as well.
I though the values, which were followed by the words "We Sell", represented how much money was in the machine for those wanting to sell BTC for USD. I didn't think the value represented their exchange rate for two reasons:
1. It was way to high. The all-time Bitcoin high was only $5,013.91. And the exchange rate at the time was only $4,887. Meaning, that green "We Sell" number at the top right of the screen was 6.2% greater than the all-time-high and 9% greater than the current market going rate. At the time, neither seemed plausible to me.
2. I scouted out the machine the day before, which was about $500 less ($4,867.88). I assume that meant about $500 has been added to the machine (more people buying BTC than selling BTC).
I suppose my last assumption was that most ATMs charge a $2 to $5 fee. RockitCoin was reporting that my transaction would have a $3 fee. I considered that their margin, which seemed akin to the margin of traditional ATMs. My expectation was that because I was going to pay a fee, their exchange rate would be more fair and closer to market average.
I appear to be wrong and admit it. Instead, RockitCoin charges a fee and a very high (in my opinion) exchange rate. 
Now I know that it is cheaper, easier, and faster for me to purchase BTC via a credit card on Coinbase than it is to find and use a RockitCoin ATM. I tried to figure that out via their website before I even sought them out, but their website does not have any information about fees or their exchange rate.
Regardless. They may charge whatever they like in fees and exchange rate. It was my fault that I misunderstood that they were displaying their exchange rate before I inputted money. Had I understood that at the time, I would not have used their service. 
Again, it was my misunderstanding, I apologized, and I updated by blog post saying so.

What do you or others think is a reasonable fee for a Bitcoin ATM? 
RockitCoin was charging both a fee and an inflated exchange rate. Additionally, my use of the machine was not anonymous (had to permit them to scan my driver's license and provide them a phone number). Since there was no added value of anonymity, I consider them in competition with Coinbase and other fiat-conversion methods. 
Should Bitcoin ATMs charge both a fee and a percentage-inflated exchange rate? Or should they just charge a fixed fee or a percentage-inflated exchange rate?
I think one or the other would be easier to understand and would be more fair to the customer, not both. The simplest and most transparent would be just a fixed $10 fee.
What would you tolerate on occasion? And what would be so ideal that you'd switch to using Bitcoin ATMs for all of your fiat conversion needs?

Came up with this "plan B HODL" t-shirt idea and found a local shop to make it for me. I'd post a link to the t-shirt shop (the owner saved the design) if a) someone's interested and b) it wouldn't be a violation of community guidelines.

wwantt may have a point. We each have opinions and are collectively lacking facts.
I only know what I was charged by a single ATM. It would be nice to know what fees and inflated exchange rates should be expected. If someone wants to gather and organize that data, here's what I experienced:
* Date: 2017-09-02 19:10 Eastern
* Cash Entered: $100
* BTC Received: 0.01876201
* BTC Value in USD: $88.01
* Fee: $2 (0.00042803 BTC)
* Exchange rate used: $5,329.92
* Exchange rate actual (Coinbase): $4,887
* Exchange rate inflated difference: 9 percent
I'd like to see more Bitcoin ATMs and for them to be fair, yet profitable. If this is what it takes for them to make a fair profit, then it would be helpful to learn that what I experienced was normal so that I adjust my expectations.

I used a RockitCoin ATM for the first time last night that looked very similar to the machine you pictured here.
I feel like RockitCoin cheated me out of my money because they a) did not provide information about their USD/BTC exchange rate until after I inserted $100 USD, and then b) did not provide me a way to cancel the transaction.
RockitCoin's USD/BTC exchange rate was $5329.92 (USD to 1 BTC) at 19:10 Eastern on September 2, 2017. 
According to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), the highest (to date) that Bitcoin has even been (ATH) was $5,013.91; which occurred at Saturday, September 2, between 14:00 and 16:00 Eastern. 
Basically, by the time I learned that RockitCoin inflated their USD/BTC exchange rate by more than 12 percent, it was too late. The machine had my USD and no longer presented a way for me to cancel or refuse the transaction.
I blogged about this, with photos, here: 
I hope it is helpful and I hope that other Bitcoin ATMs treat their customers more fairly than RockitCoin treated me.
