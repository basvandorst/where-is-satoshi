Seems legit to me.

It’s a typical Pinocchio formation guys, relax. Let’s hope an inverted Bart or at least a Stegosaurus tail formation will follow. :-)

Anything can really happen...
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:10:47
Yes it is a good strategy.
@_date: 2017-08-06 02:06:48
Which keyboard is that?
@_date: 2017-08-06 05:12:45
Thanks Mate

WTF moment of the day.
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:09:01
We —all made this mistake: learn the lesson. 
Timing the market in order to avoid pullbacks and attempt to re-enter at cheaper price is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for anybody. Over and over again, Bitcoin teaches us that “time in the market” is a way more important (and a more profitable strategy) than “timing the market”. In short: buy and hold. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:27:15
There is obviously no consensus. We are all in completely uncharted territory. Be aware that BTC is an experiment and you may also lose money. Good luck. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 00:37:25
People are just taking profit, in my opinion. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 04:06:11
Seems legit

@_date: 2018-06-17 12:28:31
Pretty reasonable summary tbh 
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:19:08
Amazing. Hug your mum and give her a lot of love! 
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:02:27
Looks amazing! 
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:27:14
Those selling (at any price) in 2017 risk not being able to re-enter if not at a much steeper price in 2018. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:34:47
BTC always crashes UP. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:15:30
So true! I couldn’t have said it better. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:13:34
Seems legit

There are only 19 paintings from Leonardo Da Vinci that survived. 18 of them are in Museums and not for sale. The Sator Mundi is the only painting from Leonardo available in the market. I would say that his paintings are even more deflationary than BTC. ;-)

@_date: 2017-11-22 00:58:54
Totally legit. The Previa is amazing. 
@_date: 2019-04-24 07:07:26
Same. It’s a lifestyle except that I started even earlier. :-)
@_date: 2018-03-18 04:49:02
You are underestimating how many potential wallets are out there, my friend. The magnitude of the task you envision is the basis of the whole Bitcoin cryptography. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 04:50:29
Those selling now are fools. :-) just relax and don’t look at the prices for some weeks/months. There is a life out there. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:29:58
Seems legit if you ask me. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:17:04
If you don’t set aside two afternoons of your time to study Bitcoin, the technology and its implications, its adoption and network effect, it is very easy to dismiss it for a moltitudine of prejudices hardwired in our mindsets. Those guys at personalfinance simply have a pre-judice (they judge before knowing). 
@_date: 2018-07-14 12:21:50
Agreed completely. 6/7k was considered “Moon” in 2014. The MtGox fiasco destroyed the market and killed a big slice of the (very precious) early adopters, so much that it basically delayed a wider worldwide adoption of potentially 3-4 years. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 09:05:09
Seems legit to me. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:53:27
I have searched and could not find any robust data. On Bitcointalk there are a few assumptions floating around that there are probably a few hundred thousands users with cumulative 21 BTC in their wallets. Also, whenever the price goes parabolic many people cash out so se situation is changing quickly in 2017. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 12:10:24
Agreed. Or a typical inverted Stegosaurus tail pattern. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:55:01
Ahaha 
@_date: 2017-07-21 09:37:27
Thank you! 
@_date: 2017-07-21 05:45:31
How would that work? Asking for a friend. 
@_date: 2019-05-05 00:32:23
As soon as possible
