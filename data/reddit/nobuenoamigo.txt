Come on man. We already know it will be possible. But the fact it's not possible yet is the point. People still expect the devs will figure something out to fix it. When it is known they can't and that all that BTC is subject to theft the market will react. Priced it al in? That's nonsense.

Exactly, besides the fact that it's not smart to wait 5 years, it could be that the outcome of NIST isn't as good as people expect. It's better to work with what's available now and be ready to switch to something better when and if it comes along later.

You're the one assuming thieves care about the BTC market, like whales do. Whales want long term gains, they're investors. But if a whale goes wrong the market is wrecked for a while. Like the Hashing war selling. In the case of a theft, it would be a mallicious whale, not being an investor and instead of long term views, going for short term big fiat profit. Selling it all slowly, but in a short amount of time, and then like dezeyay proposed, shorting. You know what shorting is? By your reaction looks like you don't. The thief would want people to panic. Panic would be part of the plan, a strategy. And crypto investors are easily spooked as you know. Just some media attention and proof of a hack. A hack isn't just a whale selling, it's proof of the fact there is a security breach. Remember Mt.Gox? Now that was a hacker slowly selling untill it got noticed a hack had occurred. When the hack was exposed, the market got wrecked. That was a hack of a exchange. Now if an actual blockchain would be hacked the consequences would be way worse. Especially if the hacker eventually deliberately goes for panic reactions.
BTC being hacked, would not be normal. Far from. You're in denial.
