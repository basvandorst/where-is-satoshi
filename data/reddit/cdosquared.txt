Cars are expensive, but Chinese people are wealthy.
@_date: 2014-03-03 15:21:01
Listening to american talk about $100k car just makes me feel how poor are my fellow americans?
Come on, a $100k car is like dime-a-dozen for the Chinese. Even a simple BMW 5-series costs $100k and they're freaking everywhere.

I can't wait for the day when Bitcoin drops to below $1 and remind myself how freaking stupid you sound in this post.
Stop pretending to be a visionary. The real world is different bro.
@_date: 2014-04-11 06:40:43
China doesn't give a shit about you either. The fact is, China is much much more important than you little opinion
@_date: 2014-08-18 15:00:30
Commence r/bitcoin circlejerk - how this is irrational and presents *yet another* perfect buying opportunity!
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:13:12
This subreddit is like a giant circlejerk. You guys need to go outside and be more objective.
@_date: 2014-08-18 15:12:13
Seriously, stop saying completely un-grounded things like *"China's shadow banking sector imploding"*. This is the kind of stuff Western journalists write to catch attention and to fool their uninformed readers. If you're aware of the actual situation in China, you would laugh at how stupid these sensationalists titles are.

"every bit as rich as New York or Silicon Valley". LOL, hahaha, you clearly haven't been there lately because Shanghai makes New Yorkers look like a bunch of poor peasants.
@_date: 2014-03-04 03:06:46
It's the truth - American sucks and China rules. That's why I left the US and moved to China.
@_date: 2014-03-03 15:22:21
Because those people are idiots detached from the harsh reality.
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:14:02
Only articles that celebrates bitcoin will be upvoted. This subreddit is useless.
@_date: 2014-02-24 06:14:52
LOL, Chinese are poor!? You have got to be kidding. You sound like one of those American closet idiots who have not been to China lately. Let me blow you little mind, Chinese are much richer than Americans.

Can you still buy BTC there, and then transfer the coins to Coinbase?
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:41:59
No, without China, this thing will be a dud. China plays the most important role in the success of Bitcoin, not the US or some 3rd world country.
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:43:57
Yeah, and I expect to be downvoted because I'm not a Bitcoin perma-bull.
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:32:17
When the Chinese is serious about this, you know it's gonna be BIG.
@_date: 2013-12-18 03:13:11


Wow, captain obvious right here.
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:07:28
No, what the China's PBOC is doing is abolutely the right thing. They are not regulating individuals from participating in the Bitcoin market, in fact, they clearly stated that they welcome individual participation. They are focused on ensuring financial stability in this completely unregulated system (read: exchange scams) and hunting down illegal money laundering schemes.
Every other central bank/regulatory authority should follow PBOC path.
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:48:16
STFU you moron. China played the most important role in Bitcoin's success today. They're doing the right thing to ban money laundering and other illegal activities on bitcoin
@_date: 2013-12-08 07:52:14
Big spread = more money made by coinbase. Simple as that for the middle man.

Typical stupidity in your ignorance of China. If you still think China this way, my gosh you are in for a big surprise when they overtake the US.
Wake the fuck up kid, get out of your brainwashed bubble and see China yourself.
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:44:37
Can you convert the bitcoins you buy on CaVirtex and sell them on MtGox?
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:24:40
China is also the most entrepreneurial place on earth this very moment. It's not a US world anymore, my friend.
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:31:33
you clearly are one of those closet Americans who read about US propaganda on China, but have not been to China yourself. Poor soul, you're missing out on the most important paradigm shifts in the world - china is going to rule the world this century.
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:46:38
Because China is rich now (serious). Don't be silly and assume the US is still king
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:32:24
Wow, you clearly have not been to China lately. It's absolutely PHENOMENAL. The opportunities, the standard of living, the caliber of people.
China is going to dominate the 21st century.
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:28:07
No, US market is irrelevant compared to the Chinese market for Bitcoin. China DOMINATES Bitcoin trading volume.
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:32:55
China pretty much owns bitcoin market now.
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:16:46
Thanks, I want to understand the delays involved in the process here:
- how long does it take between when you click "BUY" and when you actually get your coins?
- how long does it take for you to transfer your coins to another exchange?
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:08:54
No, absolutely not. They're focused on scams and money laundering.
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:22:45
More like RIP Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:28:37
You sound like an american idiot.
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:22:18
That's it guys -- China is out, the game is over for Bitcoin for the time being.
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:29:18
You sound like an American who have not travelled much outside of America and read all this BS about China. Let me burst your little bubble - you've been brainwashed by the garbage media in the States.
If you think China isn't going to dominate the 21st century, think again.
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:33:03
Thank you for this helpful break down. Diving into this a little bit more: say I buy at market and get filled on my BTC order. Does this mean the BTC I bought is immediately available for transfer to another exchange/wallet?
@_date: 2013-12-08 07:49:56
You sound like one of those idiot Americans who are too brainwashed by the shitty media in the States.
@_date: 2013-12-09 04:03:02
As far as service and professionalism goes, BTC-CHINA takes the cake. A team of very deligent and professional folks running the team there. As far as website design goes, I like Coinbase.
