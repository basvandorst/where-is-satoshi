I think could be a better place. Pretty much based on bit coins and people can tip bit coins. This could be win-win situation for Change Tip  and MillionaireMakers. 
I really like this concept. Just for the kick of making some random guy millionaire, Only reddit can do this.

Once a lawyer wakes up from his disease after treatment, and notices his spouse besides him. His eyes little open and he utters, "Hey beautiful!" and then he falls asleep again.
His wife gets a shock because he never heard it from him.
After 10 minutes, he again opens his eyes and he says Hey cute!"
She asks what happened? Earlier you were calling me beautiful but now cute. why?
"The drugs are wearing off!" He replies!

I really like this Crypto currency concept. I spend lots of time playing online and I really hope Steam starts accepting Bitcoins following Microsofts path.

The very first time I came across bitcoins before 3 years, thought it was a scam and did not bother mining. Infact I did not even bother drilling down what are goods and bads.
Now these are very popular, I got reintroduced to these in DOTA2 game trading recently. I feel so sad, I should have mined coins then :(
Some times you don't know what turn's of to be a scam and what turns out to be a path breaking technology. From then I decided to put my "risky" investments in things like this which could be awesome in future.

Why did you "whiteout" the name of person who sent you the doc. I think you should be right to reveal identity/details of a pisher. Other users could be alert of similar details
Also please **do not post links/Hyper links to pishing sites**. That too on weekend. Please delete them.

Not sure if this works for you but, try Xapo wallet.. I think you can send BTC via email too. Other guy will be able to claim that amount from email. 
Recipient gets email with "claim now" button. I like Xapo wallet services. 
EDIT: you might need to create a XAPO wallet and have your BTC's sent to that wallet first to use this.

**What is Black money and what you can Do?**
Basically most people can do cash transactions and evade taxes in India by hiding the transaction ever happened or not keeping trail of it. This is what we call black money. Also, there is a theory that the security of existing 1000 and 500 INR bills has been compromised and lots of terrorist and illegal activity funding happens through this cash bills
**How big is 1000 INR bill in India?**
Now, you might not be able to do much with 7.5 USD or 15 USD in USA, but that amount can get you a lot in India and do a lot.
 
* 1000 INR - you get 4 BIG Mac's in USA
* 1000 INR - you get ~10 Mahraja Mac's in India. (or you can hire 2 daily wage construction labourers for a day)
**What can you do with black money in India?**
Many smart cheaters convert this money to Gold or Real estate or even USD. However, there is a "large" portion of that money hidden in Mattresses and Bathrooms of many people to be used to purchase votes and liquor for election times. Its easy to store big amount in 1000INR bills than lets say 100 INR bills, it takes 10x less space and movement during elections is easy / safe.
**What has government done till date with demonitization:**
Government one fine night announced those bills are not valid anymore and people should exchange the old bills for the new ones in 50 days (before December 31st 2016). It is implicit that now those guys who stashed the bills need to mobilize that untaxed/untracked money and convert it to legitimate bills now without government authorities not noticing you and tracking your movements. 
As part of this move government limited the amount you can exchange 
* You can deposit cash directly to your bank accounts now, But you will have to explain where the money came from if the amount is too large(more than ~3500 USD) 
* For daily expenses you can exchange old 500 and 1000 bills for new ones but there is a limit of 4500 INR a week for this
* Government passed clear instructions to Jewellers and Gold shops to track and collect details of all large gold purchases
* government instructed foreign money exchanges to be more careful and scrutinize any large purchase of dollars
* government is trying to head towards a cashless economy and push people to use banking and electronic cash instead of fiat currency wherever possible.
EDIT: Formatting and typos, also shoot if you have any questions around this.
