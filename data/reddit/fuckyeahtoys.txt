what exactly is it that you do here?
@_date: 2012-05-20 20:15:17
Great suggestion!  We definitely plan on filling out our selection to meet everyones needs.  I have been looking at the carying [cobra male stimulator]( by fun factory and the [tenga eggs](

Yeah, I am mostly after those that want to spend bitcoin in general.  We heard there was nothing to buy other then drugs for bitcoins, so we are here.  Mostly because we like bitcoins too.
Also, you didnt hear it from me.. but word on the street is sex toys and drugs make for a pretty good night.

first of many high quality toys I will be offering.  
Thought you might like to know that we're going to be setting the bar damn high for erotic products for bitcoin. Offering retail level prices and anonymous/discrete packaging.
Looking for something special?   Let me know.

 Let me know what you fancy!

I did not get it?

Yeah, while I havnt figured out exactly what those discounts are.  I will definately be giving discounts to entertainers showing off my toys :).  Part of this is proving to the mom+pop shop that bitcoin will work, so they may be wary of discounts until we get the ball rolling.  But I hope that we can offer many promotions in the future.  I am also interested in offering commissions for entertainers who suggest my shop to  tippers who would like to buy them gifts.

Yes! I have been interacting with those communities where I can, while trying to keep integrity and show support for the sex positive community.   They're actually my inspiration for starting up shop.  I have been told by more then one lady from decrypto and ggbtc that they look forward to **plugging** my toys but are **waiting for the boys** to start tipping better ;).  I hope when the live cam relationships start sparking up I will be the go to source for gifts (so keep me in mind when tipping [some gifts keep on giving]).

We may be open to expanding our shipping destinations, can likely meet most packaging requests of clientel, and if necessary have a onionland store front.  Also, what are you alluding to by middle eastern "couples",  I am open to researching other markets but might need a little direction.

Thanks for the feedback!  Price is something we have been discussing alot!  I am passing these orders on to a small IRL mom+pop store who sets the prices for me.  I was their first bitcoin customer ;). AFAIK we match retail prices, however if you see one of our products cheaper somewhere else link me, and Ill see what I can do!
A thought,  one way I try and keep the bitcoin economy going in my region is by supporting people who sell things for bitcoin over those who selling things for $.  I dont want to deplete my stash so I regularly try and exchange a bit of my paycheck to spend on coiners.

thanks for the tips!  Ill check out Flaxceed's posts. 
[I just started posting on bitcointalk](   I should probably focus more of my attention there.   
@_date: 2012-05-20 17:10:04
Yeah, my hope is to provide similar prices to the bitcoin economy which one would find in IRL.   Im at service to those who like toys and want to see bitcoin thrive.
