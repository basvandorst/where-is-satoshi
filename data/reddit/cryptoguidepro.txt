Hey man,
Glad I came across your comment - I actually created a guide on this last week lol
I explain public and private addresses, and how to send bitcoin from one address to another.
There are also recommendations on the best wallets to use.
I hope this helps.
Good luck my friend
PS - I hope you waited to buy; because now would be a great time! BTFD!

There are certain macro-trends that bitcoin goes through each year. 
At certain points of the year, it's great to buy bitcoin, then pull out at a profit and invest in altcoins, then rinse and repeat.
The strategy is based on analyzing bitcoin's dominance in the market.
My friends and I have made good profits off doing this last year, and plan on doing it again in 2018.
