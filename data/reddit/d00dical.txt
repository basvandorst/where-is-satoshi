if one bitcoin is worth one million dollars you will not need one whole bitcoin.

Both times I cashed out from coin base it said the money was coming in 4-6 days and I both times I actually got it the same day I cashed out.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:45:53
i can sell bitcoin on coin base for 16k that is not a premature celebration IMO.

I'm sorry it was agreed upon in 1992 and went into effect in 2002? i don't fuck with Europe i just read the wikipedia page, when i read it i had thought that 1992 seemed like way too long ago.  Regardless this proves my point even more.

Why are people sending you bitcoin in the mail?

@_date: 2014-01-13 18:29:26
its like if seamless accepted bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-21 07:34:33
you realize the euro only came out in 1992 right?  The idea that Bitcoin wouldn't become a very commonly used currency in the next 80 years (current humans lifetimes) should not be laughable.  Especially if you are "long term" what reasoning do you have for being long term? The only reason the price should go up is if it becomes more wildly used for a multitude of different things besides just being a currency.

I'm not trying to compare them apples to apples.  I know the government is most likely not ever going to change its main currency to bitcoin.  Simply trying to say that the idea someone could think that not having to sell your bitcoin in the next 80 or so years is a foolish assumption, no one knows at all what is going to be going down in that long.

really Obama has used more of a technology that hardly existed when Bush was president? That statistic could not mean less.  Its like saying the Americans used more Nukes than Germany did in WWII.

This guy had at least 200k of disposable income and lives in Dubai I'm sure he knows a TON of people that were rich and are no longer rich.  Money can make money but its not a sure thing.  
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:44:49
How is that relevant?

I am fully content having sold it as soon as possible for .14. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:13:48
Exactly one bitcoin now!
@_date: 2018-03-14 06:54:59
I HODL because I have been HODLing since before HODLing became 'HODL'ing.

i think he means he has been richer... when bitcoin was double the price it is now but is conveniently not counting that.
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:23:47
 can get fucked. Made, and then subsequently lost so much btc there when it was worth like $50

this comment gave me bro aids.

i was watching when it broke the 5k barrier and sold a bit at 5200 assuming "it just spiked $600 it will go back down by the time I wake up"... still waiting for that dip. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:27:22
yep! hoping to buy back at 4800
edit: well that did not work out
@_date: 2015-11-08 08:23:46
I like how his last point was "I can't believe we are having this argument here" as if the Bitcoin circle jerk is so strong everyone forgets about basic economic principals.
@_date: 2017-05-02 21:24:34
I don't even want to think about the amount of bitcoin I lost on super bowl bets and just-dice

That makes it sound like it has 100% to do with community.

iirc before the whole hitman sting authorities were fully aware of the silk road and were just sitting and watching.
