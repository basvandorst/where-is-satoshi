I agree 100%
I believe bitcoin will be 30k by July 28 2021
I have a person that I have used for advice and they have been right most of the time 
He’s a shaman - don’t judge , but this person saved my ass a few times with bitcoin 
Good luck

Some people are here for faith in a different system 
Most are here to make a buck - if it helps the system great , if it hurts the health of the system - they could care less

Isn’t bitcoin devaluing faster then the euro , pound or the dollar.
I have faith it will be 30k by late July ( 28-29) 2021 - so you will be okay  if you can hold
