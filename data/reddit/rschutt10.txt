Hello bitcoin community! I’m a Columbus, OH based fine artist and instructor from the Columbus Idea Foundry, who currently has an eight piece canvas print show on [display]( at COSI: Center of Science and Industry of my mixed media space inspired paintings! I started producing this body of work, called “Continuum” a little over a year ago.
I have 13 styles of 24” x 24” canvas prints available for roughly 1.0 bitcoin (including the shipping) of my space inspired works, available here: [
As for my current t-shirt line, I’m in the process of restocking and should you have interests in purchasing a t-shirt, please let me know via studio
Soon I will be rolling out an updated premium t-shirt line, but with minimum orders being as high as they are, I can’t justify offering them on my e-commerce site, quite yet. Should there be enough interests in the [new shirts]( I would love to see them come to life!
Interested patrons please choose bitcoin as your payment method when checking out.
I’ll provide a USPS or Fedex tracking number so you know exactly when to expect your purchase! Please allow two weeks for production and shipping.
Thanks for the support!
