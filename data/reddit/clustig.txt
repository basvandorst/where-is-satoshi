Thanks--and yeahhhhh, in retrospect this probably wasn't the best time to post this :/  I may come back and post this again in a few weeks like suggested.  I just wanted to get some results posted because I've been sitting on this for much longer than I would have liked.
I fixed the "less than national average of participant’s country" issue--thanks for catching that!
Unfortunately, I did not have a question asking participants where they found about the survey, so I am not sure if there is a major difference between the results from and bitcointalk.org.  I'll be sure to ask interview participants how they learned about the survey, though.
I did consider selection bias.  As I mentioned in the post, I was really limited in who could answer the survey based on the fact that it was only written in English--but also of course, as you stated, there are probably lots of people who have purchased or mined Bitcoin but don't go on or bitcointalk.org.  My research is on the community aspect of Bitcoin, so I am mainly interested in active members of the community.  But, still, it's hard to define what "community" really means here, as there are many websites that people go to discuss Bitcoins and there are many local offline communities as well.  I am in the process of making some contacts in my local community, and in my interviews I'll be talking to people from various different countries and political backgrounds.  This of course won't completely mitigate selection bias, but it will hopefully give me a better understanding of the community outside of these two websites and give me an idea of just how much I can (or cannot) generalize my findings.

Actually, I was surprised by the extremely high percentage of male Bitcoin users in my survey.  While I've seen a lot of wildly varied statistics on how many Reddit users are male, but most of them don't seem to be higher than 75% or so.  Whereas, in my survey, 96% of the participants were male.
I'm trying to talk to Bitcoin users from countries other than just America, and so hopefully some of those conversations will shed light on just how reflective (or not) this is of all Bitcoin users.  I'm being very careful to not over generalize my findings.  Right now I really can't say that they reflect all users let alone *all* Bitcoin users.

Thanks--I think I may do that.  In retrospect, I should have waited to post my preliminary findings.

I'll see what I can do about that in future studies!

To copypasta from another comment of mine: I'll definitely share the preliminary results with when I have them. It may take me a little bit to do the analysis, but I'll try to report back as soon as I can.

Thanks, will do when I have them!

No, I don't mind the advice.  From my observations there is a lot of diversity in the motivations for using bitcoin.  So, I suspect the survey results will confirm that observation in a more concrete way, which is useful in its own right.
But I recognize the survey can only scratch the surface of what some bitcoin users think about bitcoin, which is why I'll be conducting follow up interviews to dig into certain issues in depth.
But yes, I agree with you, there's a lot of reason to be cautious about extrapolating too much from the results for the survey.

Thanks!  I will come back and post the results when I have them :)

I'll come back to and post them when I have them.  It will take me a bit of time to do the analysis though.

Wow, thank you for the generous tip!  I really appreciate it!
