According to ledger themselves it is tamper-proof

don't worry, you'll never hit the exact bottom.

If the receiver doesn't need to spend straight away, they don't need any confirmations if they trust the sender. In this case just send with a minimal fee.

Haven't missed out at all. The opportunity for gains much higher than bitcoin is still abundant in the alt market. The risk/reward in alts now is much more favorable than it was for bitcoin 5 years ago.

This is what I've been thinking too. It's too far out until Segwit2x for the dip to start.

I wonder if lambo sales are going to the moon

In fairly confident they will refund you. As long as it's possible for them. 
I've been refunded a few times when my transaction got stuck.

I always send under 20 sat/B and just wait it out.

I always ignore anyone asking for information.

Dumping straight away is not necessarily the best way to support BTC. Placing higher limit sells could deter pumpers.

I entered at 7150
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:25:21
I wonder how much of that is caused by exchanges

what happened to roller coaster guy? did he get banned?

I think in order to make a fake one you need access to Ledgers private keys.

Important question... what about the bitcoin gold airdrop? BT1 token holders get it?

If it's real trezor they would have to tamper with it after you used it

a whale had set up a 1000 unit buy floor at 0.25 but it broke, the next floor is around 0.20
@_date: 2017-09-30 23:53:15
The default process is to reflash when you get it. I'm pretty sure they would have to make a fake trezor in order to tamper with the reflash.

i prefer the slow mining because it slows inflation
@_date: 2017-10-02 06:39:09
i hope i didn't set my buy orders too low
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:51:20
Either way it will flash crash; i don't see anyone wanting to buy.
