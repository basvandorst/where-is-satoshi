Just remember you haven’t lost anything until you sell. 1 BTC= 1 BTC or whatever amount you have

You have to transfer your btc from Coinbase to quadriga or a btc wallet. Might take a while for it to transfer, transactions are taking a while with all the volume lately.

Sorry I’m just trying to get this straight in my head. So you have 1 wallet running on 2 computers and you transferred the bitcoin from that wallet to a wallet on another computer. What wallet were you using on the one you lost?

Do you have access to your wallet on your phone? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:35:13
Do you have the recovery seed for that wallet with your bitcoins?

Do you still have the same computer you mined bitcoins on? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:19:29
Do the wallets have the address they sent the missing bitcoin to? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:52:32
Are there any transactions on that wallet?

Well considering it’s already the 6th most valued currency in the world... I don’t think it’ll have any problem doing that.
