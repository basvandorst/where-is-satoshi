I use reddit for years but never comment or post. I was inspired by the Rockets GM incidents so I decided to signup an account to say something for China. I saw too many biased judgement on China these days.

The CBC and the New York Times alway crop how protestors attack officers and destroy the city. Actually police officers behave really disciplined. The government has already withdraw the extradition law and they were well disciplined during the protest. What more do they want? I planned to go to Hong Kong this summer but the flight cancelled. My friend told me how rude those protestors are in the airport. They disrupt boarding, destroy facility. If you are an China but don’t speak cantonese, they refused to communicate even if they know maindarin and english. They told you to blame it on government for no reason.

its not biased. Hong Kong protestors are rioters and traitors
At the beginning, mainland China just want to extradite a murder ( one Hong Konger killed his girlfriend in Taiwan). And then they started the protest.
But mainland China gave up to extradite one month ago.  No one knows what them want right now...Now all those protestors are just destroying the Hong Kong city......
Image killing your girlfriend started the civil war......
