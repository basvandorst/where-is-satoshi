Interesting analogy, I was always more of firebug as child.
I guess it's just a general issue I have with any fiat currency. Although as you said the pound has been pretty stable but the pound has also lost most of it's value since it's inception. So I'm exploring alternatives and playing on the tracks.

It's a concern which is why I'd like to learn more. But from the very little I know it seems like I would be able keep my money quite safely stored on usb. That might be completely wrong, I'm not sure.

Hey, I'm a Londoner too and I'm really interested bitcoin. It seems like the only logical currency, and I'm reaching 30 with zero savings :\
it's probably been asked already but when is the Bitcoin exhibition? I really want to talk with someone about how to save and invest for my future... that's probably the most mature thing i've written, I'm getting old :(

Thanks I appreciate it :)

I apologise, it seems I really wasn't clear; I meant that i want to start saving and bitcoin would be the currency I'd prefer to save in. 
And I'm fine living in London, yes it's over-priced and you can much better value for money outside but I like it here and I've spent most of my life moving around and I'm glad to have found a place I can call home.

That's cool, I was at the vape lab just the other day. I can vape and learn at the same time :)

What was the wow for?

Thanks for the reply, this is why I wanted to find out more. I don't have faith in our standard currency, which is why I've been exploring alternatives. I would of course have acquired a small amount of bitcoin first and then seen how it goes, I like a gamble but not that much of gamble.
