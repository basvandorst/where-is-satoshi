U.S. classified bitcoin as a commodity. I can trade freely without reporting a transaction.

Sure, but the question is, if he used the coins for illegal activity, would i get caught up in that or am i home free
@_date: 2017-05-02 14:52:28
This guy gets it. Yea but the fees are high. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:27:49
I've explained this several times. Assume I have a buyer.
@_date: 2017-05-02 17:51:04
mix &amp; transfer to middle man. it works
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:53:01
I understand your point, but nobody is so stupid that they would buy a wallet from you. I'm simply trying to determine the legal repercussions on the original holder.
@_date: 2017-05-04 03:04:39
Thank you for understanding! Actually I've gotten one good response.
Deposit bitcoin into my wallet. Put it through a mixer into another wallet. Sell or use that wallet for "buying drugs" (not actually my intention)
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:25:04
let me explain. if the buyer is your brother. he wants to buy all your bitcoin. he gives you cash, and you give him your cold storage device.
later, those bitcoins are used to buy drugs, guns, and assassins. You're brother is pretty much in the clear unless you rat him out. You however may be tied to the bitcoin wallet used to make those purchases. If the feds come knocking, can you simply say that you sold the wallet to a stranger?
@_date: 2017-05-02 16:22:35
You fail to understand the point of all this. Let's assume you are the seller and your dad is the buyer. You trust your dad with 10k right? If not, let's assume you do. Taking that into account, it's really not stupid. Obvious this doesn't work when dealing with strangers. But the whole point is not to actually start selling bitcoin wallets. it is simply to understand the legal repercussions.

yes sir
@_date: 2017-05-02 14:55:34
Assume I have a buyer.. I've a reputation for trustworthiness.
@_date: 2017-05-02 16:16:31
you mean send it to another wallet, then sell the second wallet. I could do that.
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:53:48
Not the point. Just trying to determine the legal repercussions on the original holder. This is obviously not a feasible way to transfer bitcoin between strangers.
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:05:22
Frankly, I wouldn't want proof that I owned the addresses. And I wouldn't want anyone to be able to tie me to those addresses, including feds. I would transfer face to face to keep that anonymity. but because there is obviously the first transaction from my bank account to the bitcoin wallet, I'm concerned of being in legal trouble because no one would know that I sold it. It would just be me saying "yes, I sold it to some stranger"
is that defense enough if those coins were to be used in a criminal way 
@_date: 2017-05-02 16:29:24
My man
@_date: 2017-05-02 17:31:05
I'm not assuming that. I know that. I'm assuming that that is not the case. The purpose is not to scam anyone. You can get that thought out of your head. 
After I sell it, I will delete my private key, etc. I won't have access anymore. 
What I'm saying is that there is no paper trail to the buyer of the wallet. So he can use it freely to conduct illegal activity. 
My only concern is whether I would be in trouble since the funds and wallet are tied to my bank account with my original deposit.
However, one reddit user has given me the solution of moving the money into a second wallet (never directly tied to my bank account), then selling the second wallet. That, to me, makes sense as the best way to sell a wallet and not be legally responsible for what the funds are used for.
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:26:00
Or would they be able to tie it back to you? i just assume they would since you probably used a bank account to deposit the funds in the first place. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:10:49
Buddy, this guy is not a lawyer. His hypothetical are of no use here.
@_date: 2017-05-02 16:26:34
Yes, let's go with that assumption.
@_date: 2017-05-02 14:47:25
Simply put, because I don't want the transaction to appear in the public ledger.
@_date: 2017-05-02 14:59:59
This is one example, but I'm not sure it would follow through in all cases:
@_date: 2017-05-02 16:43:14
Who do I have to report to?
