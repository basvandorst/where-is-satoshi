I own 14 Cointerra machines and only one is having issues, with one core hashing at half the speed. Other than that they run great. I use 240V power to run them (not sure if that makes any difference). But i have called and emailed them several times with NO response. I own several BFL machines too and their customer service is just as bad if not/probably worse. 
Antminers are good but i have had nothing but great experiences with KNC if you can mange to get a machine form them. Granted the Neptunes will probably not ROI unless the coins take another big jump but they are none the less a very reputable company.

Thank you! 
@_date: 2016-02-23 15:40:27
Well, thats just fucking fantastic!

take the red pill!

Man those were the days. Literally making more money than most business professionals while sitting around doing nothing. (Well, the computers were working their tiny fingers to death, but they were fed well)

This is a beautiful explanation. Ill probably refer to this when i explain what mining is to people.
@_date: 2015-10-14 16:43:30
I found it about a year after you did. But i quickly got invested into it. I borrowed about $15,000 from my grandmother and bought 2 KNC jupiter systems, and got them in late october. Before that i had a bunch of BFL shit. But i mined for a while, made a lot of money, and attracted a few investors. We went in on about 14 Cointerra machines. We had about 25TH of power at that time. It was fun. We were churning out coins all the time. The power bill was (oh you know) $2,400 per month. But we made money, and got out. Even after the spike and fall, we made our money back. I bought a house, and still churning away at school and a program to get back into the Bitcoin game. There's mine.

The supply doesn't get cut in half. The reward for mining a block drops from 25 to 12.5 BTC. 
Supplying them will now be harder, but the number of coins in circulation isn't going to be cut in half...

Hi Mr. Nakamoto. I just wanted to thank you for coming here and doing an AMA. I have no questions, just wanted to thank you.  
@_date: 2013-05-27 22:05:33
Yeah i can see where the hole in that logic is...
@_date: 2013-08-29 03:09:38
Great! Thanks for the reply.
@_date: 2013-05-27 19:03:52
Man thats really close to our idea, kinda freaked me out. Thankfully there are some key differences mainly ours will be anywhere in the US but thank you for the information!
@_date: 2013-05-27 21:24:35
We plan to expand once its up and running, gotta get one market running before we add more :) But yes, that is one of the main beauties of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-28 15:08:42
so no one on kickstarter can run a business?
@_date: 2013-05-27 18:46:29
Ours isnt just groceries either, its anything you want/need. Fast food, stuff from Lowes, whatever you need.
@_date: 2013-05-27 16:28:32
Just sign up and we will keep you up to date :)
@_date: 2013-09-30 21:35:18
I was about to post this! It made my day. Like... FUCKING MADE MY GODDAMN DAY!
@_date: 2013-05-27 20:49:44
And youre right sir
@_date: 2013-05-28 15:36:41
Well obviously i would, but a website takes much less money to run then a brick and mortar shop. Im not saying im a master business runner but a little extra cash from the good of someones heart helps. 
@_date: 2013-05-27 17:11:33
Pay my developer, keep the server up, pay the internet cost, and various other things that have to do with getting and keeping this site up. Shoot if there was enough in donations i would have this made into an app.
@_date: 2013-05-27 22:20:41
Haha im sorry, you made a very compelling point though.
@_date: 2013-05-27 18:51:39
Ive never heard of that service, but i cant wait to have it up so everyone can start making some money and getting the help they need.
@_date: 2013-05-27 22:19:21
You will specify a time and place of delivery but if you dont make it enticing enough for a Courier then it wont get delivered. Also, once a Courier selects to go get the list you will be notified and the list will be taken off of the Courier list selection page.
@_date: 2013-05-27 18:54:00
Yeah my dev hasn't updated the site in a while, it will be getting an update within the next couple of weeks. Thank you for your support! 
@_date: 2013-05-27 17:21:43
The Buyer has to make the payment enticing enough for the Courier to run their errand. Ohh and its not just in one area, it covers the United States
edit: only one country right now, expansion will be sooner rather then later 
@_date: 2013-05-28 15:13:04
Its not about us making tons of money, its about making a service that should be available, available. They can use cash and we wont take a transaction fee. There will be a special details area so if there is trouble getting together then the buyer just has to make their number or email available or whatever. The false orders? they will expire eventually but that would be cruel to place false orders, like putting something on ebay that you dont have.
@_date: 2013-05-28 20:12:32
I have never even heard of this system until yesterday, its pretty solid.
@_date: 2013-05-28 01:50:52
i messed up because of the touch kb im using... just switch it in your head and everything will be alright 
@_date: 2013-05-28 01:59:48
ohh i see, yes i have told my dev to fix that, and also fix people's on the front page. There is much more work to be done then just grammar mistakes though.
@_date: 2013-05-27 19:08:49
Its starting in the US but we plan to expand soon after launch
@_date: 2013-05-27 16:51:26
There will be a video explaining it in much more detail soon. The buyer selects a store, makes a list, and sends a payment off. The Courier selects their city and is given a readout of the available lists in their area. We take a 2% of the total order as our payment. After the transaction is completed, both people have a chance to rate the other. I hope this helps.
@_date: 2013-05-27 16:25:00
We could really use a donation or two to help speed this project along, I hope you all think its as good of an idea as I do! I will be helping my mother move today like a good son so i wont be able to reply all day.
