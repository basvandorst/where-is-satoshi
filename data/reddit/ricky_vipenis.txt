so if you deposit btc to bitfinex - does that deposit have a tx id attached to your account specifically?  Or does it just go to a main bitfinex address and then they move it to your account internally?

so every user has their own addresses.  that means every deposit/withdrawal has a tx id that points to a particular user's wallet, and not some bitfinex hot wallet?

so that wallet used for depositing/withdrawing is attached to a particular user account.  as in each user has their own btc address to deposit/withdraw from, and one could follow the blockchain to see an individuals deposit/withdraw history, and potentially their trade history as well if given the user account details attache to the wallet?

I guess I'm really asking happens about in case of audit.  How will they confirm the status of my gains?  Would they ever ask for a tix id? and follow the chain to verify age of coins / whether they've been on an exchange before? etc?
no don't want to sell for cash. i'm not trying to evade the taxes just have my bases covered.

thank you very much for the info.  last questions i promise: is there any way to tell or find out that a btc address belongs to a bitfinex wallet?  or does it just look like any other address?
