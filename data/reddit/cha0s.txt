Fair enough, even considering that would be $20 cheaper on the same provider.
@_date: 2014-04-29 17:02:19
People actually pay for that? I could run a node on DO on a $5/mo droplet. That's absurd.
@_date: 2014-03-07 15:46:26
I just have to say this is a ridiculous characterization, since many tech uotpian guys are the same guys everyone was calling a bunch of geeks who were "jealous of success" when we have been calling out this ~~corporate~~MS stuff since forever, and advocating (and building) open technologies.
This new wave of "libertarians" stroking their erect Ron Swanson beards and grunting about property rights is something else. Software libre has been killing it in the free market forever and we're basically fucking communists.

No matter what you do, it will be trivial to find in the case of compromise. What you can do is symlink to your wallet file, and keep your wallet file on an encrypted share. When you need to access your wallet, decrypt the share. Otherwise, leave it encrypted.

It's a sure thing.
Oh, you weren't willing to wait 20-30 years to realize the gains you imagined? Pity... are you selling? ;)

okay so... the network stays robust because there are LOTS of computers connected to it that are constantly crunching cryptographic problems to keep everything secure and fair.
The more people who join the network, the more difficult it becomes for one machine to get 'free' bitcoins just from crunching those numbers.
So obviously, the people who were around before massive numbers of machines were connected got a lot of 'free' bitcoins, At this point however, you can't realistically make tons of free bitcoins without a massive investment into specialized hardware.
So yes, they got a payoff for being in the beginning, and no, they can't just flip a switch and create a million BTC into their accounts now. The whole point of the "LOTS of machines crunching HARD problems" is what prevents this.
Mining 'free' bitcoins is actually done in the process of doing work for the network itself, keeping everything secure and fair. The bitcoins that are 'mined' are the network's way of automatically distributing the reward for that work among the participants.

Sir, you need help.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:19:06
Very sweet of you (no sarcasm), but don't you think it's better for people to take a realistic perspective?
@_date: 2013-04-14 01:41:23
That's a software error. It's like if the bank transferred $1000 into your account that wasn't yours. The money did not magically appear out of thin air. That money belongs to someone else.

Hey man, I've been working on networking and handling the incoming event queue that could potentially be consumed by something like this (decided to focus on one piece of the pie, didn't like where I saw buttercoin going (no offense to them...))
I don't have source up but you should pm me, I'd love to have a chat about possibly combining forces on the different aspects.
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:30:54
The fact that you used the term "big player" shows that you are exactly the kind of person who's not here for anything other than a quick buck. Could you be quiet please? Thanks in advance!

The network becomes more efficient, and the people who invested in the new technology early are rewarded.
@_date: 2013-04-15 10:10:58
Because the merit of A does not derive its value from whether or not B supports it, and certainly does not lose its merit if you do not value B. That is the assertion made here, and it's asinine.

Just want to note: Ogg is not lossless. One feature it has over mp3 is that you can construct truly seamless loops with ogg. Very useful for game assets, for instance.

Yeah, it's not like Bitcoin was designed to make the things I'm complaining about go away or anything! I guess everyone who helped create and use it was just a bunch of losers and should have shut their mouth and kept using the government money, right Aregular89?

My bank locked my card because of fraudulent activity (someone in another state made transactions with it).
I really wanted to buy a domain, was sad until I remembered you guys. Was very easy!
The only thing that kinda bummed me out is that you waited for 6 confirmations for like $11 worth of BTC. Seemed a little silly. Still, love you guys!

Serious traders don't care how much anyone is willing to pay. Serious traders are making a statement about the value of a stock when they purchase it. Buying === belief it is currently undervalued; selling, the opposite.

Well, I think this is more of an artifact of the current banking system, is it not? If I had BTC I could transfer them anywhere instantly without having to wait for 'business' days :) That was the real meat of my complaint...
