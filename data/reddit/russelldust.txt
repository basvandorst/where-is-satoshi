The Koran is an accursed and violent book, there’s no doubt about that.
So is the bible, but for some reason most people don’t get as upset when you criticise Christianity instead of Islam

“As a German”are you not supposed to be wallowing in “The Great Shame” for what your Grandfather did and not moralise over the people who stopped him killing Jews?
Just sayin....

Closing something IS the censorship, surely that’s obvious to those who understand the meaning of the work censor

So from your position “as a German” you are able to patronise those of us on the moral side of the conflict and try and tell us that Tommy Robinson is in any way the same type of monster as your Nazi relatives?
Please, don’t make me laugh! I don’t think your brethren were killing Jews because of their mass raping of German children and TR isn’t rounding people into a wagon to gas them simply for trying to exist.
“Germans” like yourself would do well not to conflate our current situation with yours in 1941.
Actually he would have been on the right side of history because he was British and our culture didn’t fall into full on fascism despite the unsavoury characters amongst our populous. 
We never slaughtered Jews gays or gypsies here and you can’t put that on us just because your country is easily led into mass and vicious genocide.

Reddit is full of people who don’t know the meaning of the terms they use but suggesting someone can radicalise THEMSELVES takes the biscuit ����‍♂️

I think the problem is the difficulty in raising this as an issue which is tied up in this particular religion.
When the Catholic Church is involved in child abuse, covering it up, facilitating it or doing it nobody is afraid to raise this as a point of discussion. The Catholic Church were rightly vilified and questions asked whether priests and nuns were abusive due to either the guidance of or the existence of their religion. It may have been a factor some times, it may not others, but the discussions took place freely. Nobody called for people to balance their points with examples from other religions when it involved the Catholic Church.
But when the same points are made about Islam people are immediately called a racist and the discussion is shut down. It doesn’t take a genius to see a worrying pattern in grooming gangs prevalent in British Pakistani societies. If there were sections of native British society where a pattern of rape was noticed it would be discussed and addressed. 
It is entirely fair to ask why grooming gangs appear to be immediately prevalent all of a sudden. It’s essential to ask why in fact, before more young girls are raped by dozens of men.

You tell people to fuck off, you insult them, you go on to the biggest internet open forum in the world and you call for censorship and worse than anything for some bizarre reason assume the man is Eastern European and even more shockingly you make bigoted judgements based on said nationalities
You sir, are a moron

You only exist as a German because Britain and her Allies were able to show a restraint and a tolerance that your horrible genocidal relatives could only ever dream of. We saved Germans by the million we didn’t execute you or work you to death like you done to tens of millions of non white Germans
When we were digging graves for the last of the victims of the concentration camps your relatives were already getting on with their lives like nothing happened. But something did happen and it makes me sick to the pit of my stomach you trying to lecture me on fascism when the brutality and ruthlessness of the Nazi fascists has never, and will never be matched.
Your disgusting crimes have no comparisons in the bowels of time
Oh, and it’s “You’re dumber that a bag of rocks”

I didn’t mean to sound like I was having a go at you and I can absolutely understand why his character and past are off putting to people. I wouldn’t go to the mans rallies but he’s tapped into an issue which is concerning a lot of people and seems to be asking reasonable questions.
But my main issue is this modern political posturing which seems to be prevalent in discourse. Half the country are sleep walking into a PC oblivion which will effect them as bad as those who can see it coming. 
“I agree with PayPal banning Tommy because I’m not a racist” is a great example of someone who is not only conflating entirely different issues but more importantly is completely missing the bigger picture here. They’ll say the same when Twitter or Facebook or Pinterest censor those they don’t like. Every second post is like this on here. Forget the non transparent censoring and focus on the mans past
They don’t stop to consider where it will all end
Enjoy yer weekend

See, now I know you’re not German. I lived in Germany briefly in the 90s and nobody brought up with ‘The Great Shame’ would try to abdicate responsibility like you have, implying that only some Germans are responsible. You all carry the burden for the dead millions 
Strange how none of these good Germans spoke up before 1945.
Strange how they plead ignorance but were able to ignore the smell of burning bodies from the camps.
Strange how they didn’t notice all the disabled, Jewish, gypsy and homosexual citizens in their towns suddenly didn’t exist anymore. Strange nobody questioned why?
Strange that Russians, Americans and the British liberated the death camps when there were so many noble Germans around.
Your country must always carry the shame of the disgusting truth of your forefathers, each and every one of you. That includes you
