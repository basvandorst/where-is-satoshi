@_date: 2019-08-26 23:18:15
Btc 100k valuation
@_date: 2019-10-17 17:23:54
I would never consider ETH to be a shitcoin - yes alts will get pump as well but no really shitcoins
@_date: 2019-08-12 20:28:34
So the plastic cap must represent shitcoins
@_date: 2019-08-26 22:16:35

@_date: 2019-10-17 15:41:59
Shitcoins will move up as well, but only 10%
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:39:50

Is this the 1000 BTC pizza from the past?
@_date: 2019-04-19 17:38:36
Not everyone will jump on 1BTC wagon, instead they will own altcoins and satoshis
@_date: 2019-04-13 15:33:18
Why the fuck would you make this claim in the first place, this is like a suicide mission... 
People are not stupid, especially here
@_date: 2019-04-25 19:19:31
Not sure if BTC is good for microtransactions right now, but with lighting this shit is possible.
Bat got the first mover advantage
@_date: 2019-04-25 15:05:33
But but only crypto is a currency which cant be taken from you... 
If u hold to this principal u are golden

Clearly being a Satoshi Nakamoto doesn't work for him. Time to change strategy, Jesus maybe?
@_date: 2019-05-21 19:35:53
This is his last nail to the coffin, time to bury this motherf..er
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:34:03

Shorting right now is a suicide...
@_date: 2018-12-01 19:04:54
You are my bro, but this is a bear market so its time to bend over again...
@_date: 2019-05-16 21:01:58
Similar situation, ditched my job last July and travelling solo, now in Colombia. Love it and will never come back to my previous life. Find the purpose and contribute to society.
@_date: 2018-12-05 11:00:01
The storyline really let me wonder of aliens involvement in this space...
@_date: 2019-05-11 01:50:16
Would make lots of sense if u actually paid for those sausages in BTC. I bet with current price you will choke yourself while eating those babies
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:25:40
Where he parks his Lambo? 
Next to the chicken farm... Hopefully free range shit
@_date: 2019-05-16 21:10:19
Better secure the profit in few different stable coins
@_date: 2018-12-03 09:05:34
Despite the price, bitcoin grow in popularity
