Everything is better than PoW, this type of consensus looks interesting.

Next week it should be 12K I guess, hope that alts like Credits and Tron will also gain...

Very nice! Should we see more coins like stellar, eos or credits?

I think that there wouldn’t be so much btc payers, because everybody holds that coin as first, in the second it’s not so usable to pay for btc now, because you have to wait sometimes for hours after your transaction confirmed, in third there are huge fees, which sometimes equal to the price of thing which you wanna buy. it’ll more usable to pay by another currencies with a very fast transactions and very small fees, like stellar (14k tps) or Credits coins (400k tps) or some others with a same opportunities.

It's a cryptocurrency based on it's own blockchain platform, however it's still released only in beta version.

I think that they told it just for hype, only the time shows. There are many other much perspective and technologically upgraded blockchain projects that investors interested in. For example VeChain, Stellar or Credits.
