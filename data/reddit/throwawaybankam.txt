I should check that out. See I've got around $20 that I can use to experiment with on BTC/ETH/XMR, because if I get a hang of things I can use bigger amounts. Like toy money (got it free from Coinbase a while ago.)
So I figure if I get a solid enough knowledge of what's going on, maybe I can actually get my hands dirty. I've started following r/bitcoin, r/ethereum, r/bitcoinmarkets and this sub. I'll check zerohedge too, although I'm still searching for more stuff to read on it. Someone suggested I start reading crypto white papers, so there's that too. Hopefully this should be good enough.
I'm considering BTC, ETH and XMR based on the word from r/Cryptocurrency. What do you think about those three? And what's your opinion on the word that BTC is going to hit $2,000 or even $3,000?
@_date: 2017-01-07 04:30:02
fair enough

you're right, reward only comes with risk, but maybe a better understanding of the risk can lead to a higher reward.

I'm a rookie here. do you know where I can read a primer on this? 
@_date: 2017-01-07 13:44:27
naturally, after we get the coins we want to see it succeed. but won't there be a lot of people wanting to wait for bitcoin to dip to buy more of it?
also what do you think will be BTC's floor?
@_date: 2017-01-05 18:10:56
do they always have an inverse relationship?
@_date: 2017-01-06 17:39:25
so if I currently have any BTC, do you think I buy any more? Do you think I should sell my existing BTC? Or exchange it for ETH?
@_date: 2017-01-06 18:47:19
it's my decision, but some advice would help me in making the decision
@_date: 2017-01-06 12:04:47

@_date: 2017-01-05 17:24:40
with a higher price why is it less profitable?

sorry I'm asking a million questions, but would you say the same for ETH/XMR or any other currencies? 
I'm not sure if selling my current BTC and buying at 700 would be a smart thing to do
@_date: 2018-04-15 07:04:06
I would do anything to get that note, the highest I have is 1000000 turkish lira

Think any of those crashes are going to happen again?
@_date: 2017-06-05 20:10:18
My favorite was back in December/January, when BTC was rather rapidly fluctuating between $800 and $1000
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:46:10
*looks at wall, pondering* Yeah, why didn't we buy more then...
@_date: 2017-06-05 20:00:23
fuck don't remind me dude I didn't take the opportunity to buy it when it was $12 earlier this year even though this entire sub was screaming it at my face
@_date: 2017-06-05 19:34:55
sure and so does Ripple.
@_date: 2017-06-05 20:13:58
won't that cause the value to go down a lot though?
@_date: 2017-06-05 19:42:13
damn dude, you just made the financial equivalent of a Super Mario jump
@_date: 2017-06-05 19:43:19
900 goddamn bitcoins, was this at like around 2010?
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:15:02
$50 -&gt; $300 when you sold it likely -&gt; exchanged for $12/ETH -&gt; $6000 today
which isn't just a Super Mario jump, it's a jump after eating a mushroom
