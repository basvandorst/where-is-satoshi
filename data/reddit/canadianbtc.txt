I have alot in that wallet... i cannot believe i just did that.
@_date: 2014-05-27 00:30:27
Are you sure this will work even with the password on there?

Even though i am about as pro BTC as it gets, i think in 18 years we will have something better. 
Technology continues to accelerate.

Had my seed and original pass in a buried truecrypt USB... never been so happy about that. Not the right pass but same seed.
Didn't realize the seed worked even with password encryption

Story time. 
One time i was mixing coins, and used a TOR mixer. Sent .1 BTC through, all went well. Sent 2.2k worth of BTC through, all good. 
Went to actually *withdraw* them and bam, disconnected, account gone and coins lost. 
Was a shitty day, that never happened again.

i can remember some of them, i assume there is no support for electrum?

No matter when you joined you say that. I first saw it at $9, didnt actually start buying anything substantial until $50 and i still hate that i didn't buy it when it was cheap.

What is the situation up here in Canada? I always hear and read about the FED but is it any different elsewhere?

Might do it that way, if possible i would like them to have to do some wallet work, and if possible a transaction to get at the BTC.

True, barrier to entries are a bitch.
@_date: 2014-05-27 00:50:26
Got it, thanks for the quick reply. Almost died there lol.
@_date: 2014-05-27 00:42:04
were talking the string of words right?
@_date: 2014-05-27 06:52:01
It is indeed great but I am definitely moving these to cold storage
@_date: 2014-05-27 00:27:25
How do i "close" this wallet? when i go to restore it just says this file exists.
@_date: 2014-05-27 03:46:22
Think I might just buy a cheap laptop, DBAN it and then use it offline for bitcoin. 
What methods do you use for cold storage?
@_date: 2014-05-27 03:44:04
Way isn't that long in that case, I doubt it's more than ten bucks

Hopefully a lesson was learnt today lol
