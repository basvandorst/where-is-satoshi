You should set up a mention related to the security...
If people is connected to their Google account while reading/modifying the sheet, their full name will appear, disclosing much information :)
Some guys typed XX Bitcoins, potentially disclosing their name.

Wrong. Bitcoin is a horizontal system. Confirmations = number of nodes, this is a wrong system. Sorry to say that and to be against god Satoshi, but it was a wrong idea. How a decentralized system work today? Think about DNS: started fully decentralized, and now, fully by confidence. You don't have to trust your provider, you have the choice, but with time, you trust your provider because the system allows you to check things.
@_date: 2014-09-22 21:57:58
Well noticed. 
@_date: 2014-04-25 21:31:05
I would agree, but this is not practical. I mean, a client wants to pay, he pays. And then: nothing. The client can say: "I just paid". What to answer? "Ah ok, that's fine, thanks". And the client leaves the bar. 
And then, 2 hours later, still nothing on the bar's bitcoin address.
So, at least, you should look on the smartphone of your customer, to check that he pushed the "send" button, which can be faked, etc etc.
Not viable.

But in the facts, every third parties will wait at least 1 confirmation, if no more. I understand your argument, but the reality is not what you described. If I buy a product, I ll have to wait 10 mn or more before having the product in my hands.

Thank you very much for your answer. Is there any public and non-technical roadmap for the development of bitcoin core? It would make sense to have a public roadmap, as it will help investors and companies involved in Bitcoin to plan the future.
@_date: 2014-04-27 11:50:56
Very nice! How it has been done?
@_date: 2014-07-25 21:08:19
Yes. Because if Bruce Schneier publish such news, it will be on top on reddit, and Coinbase would have already released a press release. Rumour you say? I say: might be true, this is 100% true, 50% a guy that want to fool a buyer, and 50% someone that really hacked coinbase.

@_date: 2014-04-25 22:57:30
Fully agree with you. Unfortunately, DNS system was think to be decentralized initially. However, people forgot it now. Progressively, this DNS systems have been fully hierarchical, and I pretend that this move is not anticipated by Bitcoin users. And it should, because bitcoin is a compromise between security and speed. People must be able to choose.
@_date: 2014-05-19 21:58:28
This is not what i said. I believe the opposite: this is an issue for bitcoin. Once again, I guess that the bitcoin micro-system can be fully absorbed by cyber-criminality. It is a HUGE market. But this will destroy us.

No risk if you check the certificate each time you connect. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 21:20:20
Apparently you don't know how SSL works. If you mean: "I am worried about a potential interception using Tor and connecting to my wallet", I say: "there is no risk if you check the certificate". And as a security expert, I assume: there is no risk. 0.0000001% risk to seen the password intercepted. Or 0.0001% if you want. No more risk than your ADSL connection. 
But maybe you don't know what is SSL exactly. 
@_date: 2014-04-25 20:40:16
Yes, I prefer this answer. I just want to point out that slow transactions are the biggest problem of bitcoins today. It prevents a massive implementation within all shops and POS.

What I believe: this is not for security they use javascript, this is for usability. I am well placed to know how it is hard to do a good website without javascript, and how it is hard to do a website that works with and without javascript. It is near to impossible to maintain. 
But I maintain a point: they should do it, for privacy issues.

I am french, and reading that, I smiled. Supporting LGBT while being in favour of weapons is so contradictory in France! 
For me, with my french eyes, supporting LGBT would be a no-go. LGBT should remain in the private area of each involved person. No more. What are you promoting exactly? The "right" of vindicative positions? Such as: "I am lesbian and proud to be"? I would answer: "you are lesbian? I don't care! Do not bother me with that". 
Supporting LGBT is a very strange position.

No, the statement is as follows:
- I put my money on blockchain.info so I trust them. 
- I trust my browser but on a limited basis: I want to remain anonymous. I prefer to see my money stolen rather than see my real IP address intercepted. 
In this scenario, because blockchain.info needs javascript, I am not really sure that I am safe. This is particularly true if we consider NSA stuff: what if blockchain.info put a javascript code to check the real IP address of depositors? 
@_date: 2014-10-25 17:44:42
- This "more secure" way is not implemented anywhere... At least not for software downloading. 
- HTTPS certifcates cannot be subverted by a man in the middle attack if the user remains vigilant and check the website and the certificate.
@_date: 2014-04-07 22:24:14
I trust them to let my money in their system, but I don't want to trust them for my anonymity using Tor. 
That's right.

I am sharing the same opinion of solar-ice: bitcoins will be centralized at the end. 
We must improve bitcoin-core faster, or develop sidechains to be able to set up a "fast money" indexed on bitcoins. 
And when I see the number of downvotes of solar-ice, I want to say: "no critics is allowed on r/bitcoin". Ridiculous.
@_date: 2014-07-25 21:13:39
But some "trolls" and rumors must be in front of reddit news. Why? Because it forces companies and organisations to CONFIRM or DENY. 
This is why reddit is a good system, but reddit users are stupid or too much brain-destroyed by mainstream media. This is so true for american people! You CANNOT contest what your media say. And if it does not appear in your official media, you just don't believe it.

Hmm, this is partly true. If you check only the signature, this is not enough. You must check that: 
- The address of the website is the real one
- The certificate is correct
- The signature of the downloaded software is correct. 
If you download a software through an HTTP website, you are at risk even if you check the signature, as it can be modified on the fly too.

Don't understand the "your wallet is stored entirely on your client". This is false: you don't have your private key on your client, and I hope this is not the case :-)
Also, "disabling JS entirely isn't necessary for security over Tor" is not fully true: there was several exploits to disclose the real IP address of a node, or to exploit the internal storage of the browser. This is in the FAQ of ... Tor ;) They say that for people highly concerned by privacy MUST disable javascript.

Because a 0-conf transaction is not secured. 
And if they want to secure a 0-conf transaction they will have to implement 80% of nodes themselves. So to create they own money...
you cannot say: "0 transaction is not secured" on one side, and say : "a private company can implement nodes to get fast transaction", because it will just lead to create a new system.

Yes, you are right of course, this is not really a "moral game" from my point of view too. But let's fight with the weapons we have: if the goal is incitate people to discover bitcoins, this could be a pragmatic approach. 
We can, for instance, imagine that one step to have the next clue will be to download and launch a bitcoin wallet to have a public address ;-)

@_date: 2017-08-19 01:49:45
Homm. You underestimate TCP, really. 
TCP =&gt; integrity + availability. (availability due to the design of the lower layer, IP). 
To simplify: 
* IP = availability (routing)
* TCP = integrity
As a reminder, security is mostly defined as "confidentiality, integrity, and availability". 
So, 66% of security is covered by TCP/IP. Not bad.
