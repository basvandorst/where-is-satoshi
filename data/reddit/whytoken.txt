This definitely sends the wrong message for bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency...

How long does a transaction take? I thought bitcoin takes a long time to confim the transaction?

People are treating cryptos as a get rich quick scheme, and whith that they overspend and use money that they either don't have or need in the near future.

The question is: Is it really better to use solarpower for bitcoin mining? How big are the CO2 emissions produced by manufacuring the solar panels?
Its like the Tesla, right now they are shifting the emissions from the product to the manufacturing side.

Haha and what do you think the outcome would be? The thought is hilarious though :D.
Vendor: I dont'accept Visa payments under 5€ because of the fe----OP: WHY ARE YOU NOT USING BITCOIN???

Shameless self promotion *cough* Whiskytoken *cough*
But yeah the volatility of cryptos is a big problem, if you regard them as viable payment methods. Since there are different kind of cryptocurrencies volatility plays a different role for them.

After a quick google search [this]( might be helpful.

Making votes more secure and direct is fine. The problem with that that is that it doesn't really solve the problem here. The government running the country has to accept these votes in the first place and have to actually carry these out. If a government is corrupt, then why sould they even implement this secure voting system in the first place. Basically using Blockchain techology is just another form of voting, there are still people on the top who are making the decisions and carry them out.

Bad news for bitcoin. Now a lot of people lost money. This case is going to be used by the media as an excuse not use cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2018-06-22 06:31:39
Interesting implementation of Blockchain technologgy into mainstream media. This also highlights the fact that this technology is really new and nobody knows how to use it yet.

The question is rather, why did Microsoft buy Github in the first place
@_date: 2018-06-14 16:10:27
Okay, very short article with no real consistency. And whats the point in comparing the market cap from bitcoin to that from banks? 
@_date: 2018-06-19 15:30:11
Actually no one really knows what happens next. But since there is so much money involved I would say that another big spike is coming. When? No clue, so the best bet is just to hodl and wait. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 06:37:09
Yeah you are right. The problem though is that there were people who were wealthy before bitcoin.    
So basically they could afford putting a few thousand bucks into cryptos and don't worry about it.     
@_date: 2018-06-14 16:48:19
Can you elaborate on that project a little bit? 
@_date: 2018-06-14 16:16:18
I thing this is rather pointless. So you are transfering money per sepa to an app and then you can buy bitcoins using that app? Why not buy it direcly from coinbase/kraken/anyothermarketplace? Whats the point?
@_date: 2018-06-09 18:14:53
Sometimes there are people who invest money that they simply don't have. When they realize that the prices don't go up as fast as they anticipated, they sell.
@_date: 2018-06-26 16:20:45
I personally don't but I would love to if more stores would accept bitcoins. It is still a very new concept tp alot of people who are not into cyptos or are tech savy, which are the majority of people
@_date: 2018-06-26 16:26:54
Big if true.
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:27:59
They actually can. There is a [wikipedia article]( on which countries impose foreign exchange controls. But the point of banning certain foreign currencies is to stabilize the exchange rate of the domestic currency...
@_date: 2018-07-02 12:56:19
Its because they think they missed out earlier and now they don't want to participate any longer. 
But as we have seen in the past, after BTC rises people get bummed out that they didn't invested earlier. The old saying "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now." applies here too.

Why should he troll? Its a viable question. Mining Cryptos takes up  huge amounts of energy. All this "just" for computing power. 
So people who don't really understand the technology or the use behind crytpos are rightfully sceptical wheter it is worth polluting our environment over that.
@_date: 2018-07-02 12:50:55
Thats the only way to mine Bitcoin profitable with a small setup...
