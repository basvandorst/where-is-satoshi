Thanks man! I am completely mind blown by the system behind bitcoin and being honest with myself I still don't know everything would like to about it. I liken it to the cloud, many people just simply can't grasp what the cloud is because it isn't something tangible. I was explaining bitcoin to my dad and he said it isn't anything real or tangible, it's virtual. I told him that in a sense it's more concrete than our paper money because it's finite and you can't just print it or manipulate it like you can with fiat.

I personally believe it will drop below where it's at now and start rising again, just my opinion. I don't necessarily want to profit, I just want to get in where I feel comfortable buying in and hold. It's a very risky venture obviously and I don't think anyone has a clue what the hell is going on with the fluctuations, even the best. I do support the idea behind bitcoin as well though so I want a piece but the investor in me is completely conflicted lol. If any of that makes sense.

Yea I think since it's so volatile I would probably hold long term for the majority of what I would purchase, maybe sell or use a portion. For instance if I bought a bitcoin and it went up in value by christmas, I would use some on christmas gifts and hold the rest. Once I get a firm grasp and form my own opinion on what will happen to bitcoin in the long term that's when i'll pull the trigger. Way too volatile to play the short game imo, even if I was successful the stress would fuck with me.

If it hits the mark or even gets close, I'm buying in on the next drop. I have many diversified investments in the stock market but this bitcoin phenomenon is blowing my mind.
