I agree with the small market capitalisation being a problem. A price change of $100 in a day would appear far less volatile if the Bitcoin price was $20k. 
However, I don't feel the small market cap in itself is a direct cause of volatility. Currently at over $11B, the market cap of Bitcoin is larger than that of a lot of less volatile assets. (albeit dwarfed by other currencies)

Point taken $11B isn't very large in the whole scheme of things, but this shows even with a market cap of $462B Apple still is reasonably volatile. As a percentage change in price, Bitcoin is still more volatile though. 
Some small niche markets have relatively stable prices. My question was whether a low market cap actually makes the market directly more volatile? 
Is there a greater importance on market cap when considering currencies?
I'm just trying to stimulate the discussion here and being purposely difficult.

There are a fews of links between hoarding and volatility. 
Firstly hoarding may be a result of predicted future price rises. This in part plays into the "bubble" issue. When prices reflect over optimistic future price changes rather than realised returns. 
SEE: Hüsler et al. (2013). Super-exponential bubble in lab experiments: Evidence for anchoring over-optimistic expectations on price. Journal of Economics Behaviour &amp; Organization. 92 (1), p304-316.. 
Secondly more simply hoarding may represent market power (like your example of large sell offs). 73% of Bitcoins have accumulated at addresses that receive, but never send. (Mt Gox, 2013)
Hoarding also adds to liquidity problems, as there is only a small proportionate amount of Bitcoins actively in circulation compared to those actually mined. Each Bitcoin therefore holds more weight than it would otherwise.

Back in May, Max Keiser discusses the possibility of a central clearing exchange:  
He claims that if he wanted to set up an exchange that he would have to borrow a large amount of bitcoins to become a market maker at an interest rate of ~250%. This high interest rate I presume a result of the current rapid growth in price and the volatility.  
Do these high borrowing rates somewhat limit the chance of such a central exchange?

Does anyone agree that the lack of a borrowing/lending market in Bitcoin is a problem?
In a typical currency market, investors have the option to lend their currency through the banking system, receiving an interest rate. 
This option for lending would allow hoarders to still benefit from price rises whilst earning an interest rate from leant Bitcoins. 
Leant Bitcoins would return to active circulation in the system alleviating many of the problems of hoarding.
Does this seem like a logical argument?

Thank you for that link on media exposure. I had never thought of using Google search queries as a proxy to media interest. This would make for an interesting empirical comparison when discussing the topic. Running a regression against price changes I'm sure would return a high correlation at a quick glance.
