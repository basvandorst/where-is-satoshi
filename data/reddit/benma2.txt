This needs to be opensource (as well as the Android SDK).
Ideally, the backend as well.

Good to hear about the backend!
Though open source does not always equal open source. The license is too restrictive. Please consider changing to the GPL or MIT license. I like open source because I can tinker with it, fix stuff in it, and build things with it.

It is native, as it directly encodes the `&lt;version&gt;&lt;program&gt;` segwit output. The "other" segwit address, `3...`, is segwit wrapped in P2SH. This is still segwit, but you pay more fees to spend those outputs.

When I started, [this article]( helped me a lot. The rest I could gather from the Bitcoin Wiki, especially the articles on [script]( and [transactions](
The result can be found here, maybe it is of some help: [blockchain-parser-hs]( the meat of the parser is [here](

That is covered by the wiki entry on [Blockchain](

Why do you take offense? Of course another document is useful. I was just linking to an article you may have missed. 
What kind of gaps are you talking about? The wiki page is clear on what the blockchain is: the longest chain of linked blocks. Any blocks not part of that chain can be discarded. bitcoind however does not seem to store such blocks in the *.blk files, at least not on my machine.
@_date: 2014-01-05 20:12:57
Sorry, I meant blk*.dat files, not *.blk files in my previous comment.
Weird, I don't have any gaps in my .dat files. It is just one block after the other.

There were multiple paid security audits, and a bunch of product reviews. The most recent ones I've seen:
- 
- 
The BitBox02 has not been out for long yet, so I hope there will be more reviews in the near future.

Shift just launched a very early-access Android BitBoxApp to use with the BitBox02.
If you feel adventurous, please give it a try.
@_date: 2019-11-05 01:12:02
The BitBox01 got owned. The new BitBox02 is a rewrite from scratch, with a novel security concept, and systematically fixing all historical issues. See also [here]( and [here](
Disclaimer: I work on the BitBox02 and the [BitBoxApp](

That would be true if difficulty adjusted with every block, but it only adjusts every ~2 weeks.
If you remove 50% of the hashrate at the beginning of a difficulty period, you have 50% less blocks and it takes four weeks to get back to normal. During that time, if you have the same demand, fees need to rise.

Could you please react to 
Segwit2x just happened to lock in segwit on the day of UASF, but not beause of it? Could be, but rather hard to believe, given the evidence above.
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:04:18
If everyone used segwit, we have about double the capacity than before segwit. I think it's safe to say that this too can very easily be filled up. Not sure 2mb would have been enough to handle the mempool during the time when fees were $15+ for days.

Who would profit from that?
Also, you can use a random server each time, or run your own. The more people run a server, the better.
