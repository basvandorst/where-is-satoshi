...can be connected to exchange API to reflect all your trades automatically. Worked best for me once I set up my trade history manually and then just let it do its thing.

It makes me sad that the people doing TA are not more respected in this sub. It's a good tool and everyone can decide for themselves to use it or not. The hostility how TA gets brushed off while others get upvotes for posting a coin in a rollercoster is disturbing and frankly quite childish.

I think its a good idea if the target are housewifes who heard of bitcoin and want to earn some with a virtual garage sale.

My guess is that u/Red_Bagpipes lntipping like crazy, is just to piss the IRS off with plenty of donations which he files as tax-deductables this year.

Sell partially, buy back in steps. Minimizes the loss, but also the profit in case you (or your analyst) are wrong.

^ This is the advice of a professionally seasoned eye.
I would add:
1. When you mirror the graphic line, also mirror the blonde to make it work with the coin.
2. Use the Bit-Coin everybody is accustomed to, the one with those cirquit board lines around the center.
3. I dont see why the hexagon? Just use the original Bitcoin logo.

I would need to charge 80 dollars just to rework it, so yes for 7 dollars you can't complain.

The China-US situation was actually the reason I started with Bitcoin 3 months ago.

I really dont like how you cut things together.
Did you actually conduct any of those conversations?

I would want to see this with barcodes and prices directly on the machine so I would not have to go to the website to make the purchase, but directly scan a code on the machine. Also, chip/contactless interaction would be great.
I totally see this dispenser working in an office.

I thought about today, if a cold wallet could be insured with my household insurance, same like jewellery or cash? Or would I need a so-called cyber insurance? How could one prove ownership to the insurance beforehand and record the public wallet adress with the insurance? I could not find any hint in my 32 page long insurance contract, so I guess there is plenty of legal work for your colleage to do...

I think as someone who has very limited access to a computer during 12h a day, you should not trade, but rather just invest an monthly amount that you are comfortable with and hodl for a few years. Of course, there will be bigger decisions that require you to trade once in a while, but you should not sit behind your computer everyday after work and try to make up for any missed short termed opportunities that popped up during the day. This is how it works for most of us I guess, keeping our freetime available for leisure and our minds sane.

Actually could be done, but you are framing it very simply. I take reddit as a measure for the general mood and somewhere it probably has an influence on what I do. Certainly not a very important criterium though.
So whats your budget for testing? XD

Fundamentally, I think you are right. But I think it's wrong to blame either fiat or bitcon or any other means of exchange. It's about peoples attitude and often, decency starts with the choice of words. This is about dignity.  
In this sense I absolutely support your point about r/BitcoinBeggars, on the other hand it's a catchy name.  
But really, feel free to just create any named subreddit you like. r/BitcoinCharity exists BTW.

Well honestly, my best advice is to not get scammed by people or by shitcoins. Dont take every offer that is made to you, trust your judgement with a good chunk of self-trust and estimation. You need to be in control of your steering wheel, if not today, then tomorrow. You will get through it.
About the ethics of crypto I believe it gives more influence to the general public as of now. I hope it will even the way for easier participation of the really neglected, with micro-loans, better cashflow, etc. Just it is too early today and most ppl are more into speculation than they would admit. Dont let them drag you down, ppl have been like this forever and will most likely stay that way.
Best of luck.

You where lucky that your card got declined. At  you will at least get ripped off.
Just go to  and learn how to buy bitcoin without getting ripped off or scammed.

Why would they really want BTC as long the cant buy their ingredients with BTC. Once the todays farmers kids eating at BKing are grown ups and accept BTC for their potatoes, then BKing will actually also hold bitcoins. It will take a generation.
To let customers pay with crypto is the first step, Bitcoin going a full circle in the value added chain cannot happen tomorrow.

1. While peer-to-peer exchanges are interesting, I don't think it's the place to start at.
2. I hat a fairly simple experience with Kraken and think their fees are slightly better than Bitstamp. Hands away from Etoro and Revolut.
3. If you are not the kind of person who has their browser-menu cluttered with search-bars and don't know why they are there, I think it's save to leave your funds in the exchange for a while - assumed you follow the security measures (2-factor authentification). From there, you can experiment with downloading a wallet, installing it, writing down the seed phrase, etc. You will be guided through the process by most wallets. Then you can finally send a small amount from the exchange to the wallet and see how that works. Take into account some fees +/- 10€ to "waste" on your play money. Once you are comfortable with the process, you can move your whole funds away from the exchange, best to a hardware wallet (which will hopefully will be already financed by the gains in the exchange).
