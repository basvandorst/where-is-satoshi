jeez you're so stupid you piss me off - you tell people to "move away from the selfish obsession" when you're the only called yourself a greedy pig and lamenting about how you didn't make any short term profit? fuck you again

thanks for the update, saw that today... saw news it is

I guess they'd be alright if they sold RIGHT after the crash, it hovered around 150-180 for a bit of time, then plummeted to something like 65$ for a bit when mtgox was down for 12 hours.
Not going to lie, I sold a ~30 coins at $84 to hedge the risk a little (I bought in at $34... I'm not complaining!) with the intent to purchase more when it dipped really low after gox came live again, but I'm surprised and pretty happy that it didn't. Looks like everyone on is in it for the long haul less some day trading. Sadly I did it on campbx which has some terrible amount of users and I can't even buy back the coins at a reasonable price... such is life of not committing.
It is only day 1 I guess, so we'll see what happens tomorrow.

given the potential, yeah it's minuet

The coinlab partnership with mtgox was something I was really looking forward to. I really thought it would help stabilize the market... unfortunately this had to happen :(. Live and learn I suppose.

campbx.com offered leverage trading quite a while ago

looking good to me - I was hoping the price would hover around 200, then any good news and shoots up to 300-500... hahah I guess after the gox debacle it'll take another year or so
@_date: 2013-04-12 10:16:36
Haha yeah thanks - I fully plan to buy it back and some once I get a feel for what's going on - I was an economics major during college (or the lack of college I should say) so bitcoin is quite dear to my heart. It's theoretical economics to the core.
I don't know anything about trading, but I do know a bit about economics to say what bitcoin has already accomplished is far beyond amazing. I've always learned so much theory, "but this practice this happens because of government, politics, war, etc etc", and bitcoin negates all of those with open information.
Onward I go! I feel naked without my full supply of bitcoins...
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:01:54
Yeah I've been amassing a lot of coins the past few hours... either way, I'm ready to give up everything I've invested in support of the cause. I can still sell now and make a hefty few thousand, but hey, small price to pay for something I truly want to see happen. 
I've been following bitcoins since it was 1$. It was too hard to get at the time (and I also had less expendable income back then... startup life) but it was always intriguing. I have no doubt bitcoins will make a comeback, be it 1 year or 5.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:34:30
I don't know I've been trading on it, seems fine... I just sent a bunch to my gox but now gox is down.................

apple bubble pops, drops nearly 50%, no one mentions it. bitcoin spikes for a day and comes back to 900% the beginning of the year, everyone goes ballistic. everyone on here is an amazing trader

Apparently you don't understand that my account is not a throwaway - I just never wanted to partake with smart asses like you. I thought I'd do something nice for the community once and give a bit of hope because of some bits of information I had from being involved in the tech scene that the community did not yet, because I care about the longevity of bitcoins. I thought the community would benefit from knowing what I knew about these VC's, so I wanted to share and give some hope so those (like you) who think they've lost a fortune. I don't give a shit about my reputation with idiots like you to create a 'throwaway' account. You really think I give a shit about my reputation with a bunch of college idiots like you?
I've been following bitcoins since they were 1$ and even tried a startup involving them - that didn't work out but I've been a supporter of it since long before you bought your 0.1 bitcoins to say you were a part of it. I watched live as I gained and lost tens of thousands of dollars the past two days without flinching because I'm a firm believer in the idea behind it, and I know that it'll make a comeback even stronger.
Don't tell people to downvote when you don't know what the fuck you're talking about. You sound like a little kid that grieving you didn't sell to make that $400 to buy some new PS3 games. You don't have problems communicating on the internet, you have problems pretending you know about things you don't. Go get a job.
Why should anyone accept responsibility for anything? Do you not realize bitcoin is at over $100 right now?? About 1000% more than you supposedly bought it for? What the fuck are you grieving about you greedy fuck? That you only made 1000% instead of 2600%? Get the fuck out of here. Did you even read the original post? Do you know how to read?
If MtGox didn't crash, bitcoins would still be soaring right now. They were getting 20,000 signups A DAY. There's no fucking inherent value that says BTC is not worth $260, because it's worth whatever someone is willing to pay for it and nothing else. Had there been a good exchange, the rise would have kept going until people thought it was too expensive to buy, it dips and stabilize. Plain and simple.
Please shut up and stop giving shitty information like the rest of Reddit. I'm embarrassed I am included in the "we" when you speak.

stocks have intrinsic value? no they don't - after the stock IPO's it's out in the market. The price of the stock has nothing to do with the performance of the company. All it has to do is with the public perception of the company.
If it had intrinsic value, you'd be able to walk over to Apple and trade them stock for cash. Or Wal-mart and purchase goods. Or a gas station to fill up your car. But you can't, because it has no value.
At least bitcoins I can go on SilkRoad or bitcoinstore and spend it directly. Has much more value than a piece of paper you receive from an exchange that you have no idea where it comes from.

My account is 14 hours old because I just made it, smart ass. If you learn how to read, the post isn't about the current price of &lt;s&gt;gold&lt;/s&gt; bitcoins, I'm simply using it as a reference to question why people consider it failing.
I hardly think my 14 hour old account will boost the price on a random subreddit post after everyone just got destroyed by bitcoins. I'm a believer and a supporter, and if you weren't half retarded and read past the title you would have realized you were half retarded.
Read the articles dip shit
edit*: wrote gold instead of bitcoins. oops! lol sorry been reading about the crashing price of gold.
edit*: added below
Looks like you were a "greedy pig" - "I'm not going to lie, this was definitely on my mind too, but I'm the paranoid type. I can see clear motive, but that alone isn't enough for me to just believe something. We shall see. The news in the coming weeks will be very interesting. Either way, this was fun while it lasted, and I didn't make a dime because I'm a stupid greedy pig."
Just because you are half retarded and don't understand that bitcoin is more than just a short term get-rich quick scheme and apparently aren't even capable enough to learn when the information is handed to you, doesn't mean you should rain on the parade of other people. Fuck you idiot.
Guys don't listen to this dimwit - he's a self proclaimed "greedy pig" who doesn't understand the first thing about bitcoins. Get off the subreddit please we don't need more band wagoners claiming more bullshit they don't know about.
