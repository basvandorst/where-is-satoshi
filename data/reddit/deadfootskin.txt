More companies accepting bitcoin isn't even the metric we can use to measure Bitcoins success, as its not vehicle for transactions anymore, but a storage of value. It has been turned into a cheap pyramid scheme, not the decentralized revolution of money we were promised.   
Think about it. The way we measure the success of Bitcoin these days is how high the price can go (pure greed), not how well it works, not how many companies adopt it, this doesn't matter anymore.

Aint gonna go mainstream when you can barely do a transfer lol. Imagine just one country using Bitcoin as its main source of payment...would be chaos

I blame the tech because its not ready. It cant handle real life load. And you do realise that tracking your bitcoin usage is super easy? Its all on blockchain.info.... its not anonymous in the slightest.

More useless propaganda. What about some tech discussions? Oh wait thats banned, because it might go against what blockstream wants. How libertarian...

Think he got scared away after the whole CSW and BCH drama. Think he still does research for Bitcoin though. He was involved in Graphene iirc

His post makes so much sense today. Just look at how closed down the internet has become since then.
