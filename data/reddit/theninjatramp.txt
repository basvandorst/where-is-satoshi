Yeah, but the thing is with this one, a 14 year old died. More outcry, parents can be very loud when they want to. There was a lot of call for a speedlimit on that road straight after the accident.

Depends what you're in to, this sunday ~15,000 bikes (as long as the weather's alright) will be meeting up at the Jurby transport museum, modern, classic, whatever takes your fancy.

I'm new around here too, the concept is incredibly interesting and I look forward to following it carefully. Not sure I should invest at the moment, due to this bubble everyone is enjoying.
