Thank you for that insight but I do think such detractors are just fear based. The current paradigm needs some disruption and most early adaptors are libertarian with a decentralized vision. I do not fear them.  The educated do not fear them either.

They would be complete peasants to subject themselves to a valueless currency because someone else is getting rich, but yes I have seen the attitude developing in anti business cultures.
The funny thing is they would also have something of better value but with that mentality it’s better to blow your own feet off then to let someone make more money then you.

What is the ratio? Also how does money enter the supply? Is it loaned into existence using this fractional reserve system? When you suffer inflation do interest rates tend to up and during periods of poor economic activity they go down? How man Reals was gallon of gas in 1985 compared to now?

Centrist from who's view point? Keep in mind in the UK all citizens are subjects, the nature of rights is drastically different than in the US. In the UK you do not have the right to self defense, nor can you have weapons, nor do you have free speech. This is the world Democrats want to give us. We do not want it. Does this  make sense? I have found that there is little diversity of thought in the UK or in Europe in general. Most thought stems from a battle of how to use state power, there is rarely input from those who do not wish to use it all. In fact if you speak of individual liberty (The only kind of liberty that is real) people mock you in the UK. Though I must admit, that socialists and statists in the UK are far far more civilized and educated than here in the US and this is another reason they cannot break ground in the US. They are not well versed nor well traveled. They have a very hard time saying anything without calling names. This video is a very typical interaction with those who hate Donald Trump for example:

Nem is not bad, their team is not very responsive though, not as responsive as EOS. I had a business partner try to contact them through a well known third party and NEM did not respond on the project. Litecoin foundation &amp; EOS were very fast and easy to get in touch with for this particular purposes. Responsiveness behind the scenes is a big deal. If they don't respond under the right circumstances (Clearly they can't respond to all), it means they are either overworked or really don't care about new ideas.

That's a good point. Most of the bitcoins that are lost are lost online or on a digital wallet. Paper-wallets are another way as well. I did a search on Ebay for some of the BTCC products and the prices seem higher than whats on the site so there is a collectible factor it would seem too. 
@_date: 2018-08-18 14:58:00
May I ask where you are from? 
@_date: 2018-08-07 20:16:57
Yes Possibly but the fact that you can't get a response with a fairly good contact is not a good sign. They should not be so stressed so early on. I don't push people, I just inquire. I this instances I had the head trader at a pretty large exchange contact them on my behalf. EOS and Litecoin Foundation was much much easier to open a dialogue with. I am just reporting my experience. I held a lot of NEM. I have sold them all. That is just my opinion. The little things count.

Ah ok if you have not used the 400k yet you might have some issues when you withdraw. Once you start the wire process you might have an "Issue" then when you request support you might be asked to show proof of funds and when you submit your bank account "again"  and "again" for the "first time" you may find your limit is not 400K a month. It's not a good model to be able to run an exchange on. Sudden failures, no responses, money stuck. I do hope that does not happen to you, just forwarding customer comments.

This is possible, but I know their banking partner and we should be in compliance as the person who wrote our bosses AML and reviewed our corporate docs writes them for large banks. Regulation is being used as an excuse to stop competition. The only way to put an end to these unfair practices is to report them to the trade regulators, but that is bad for bitcoin. The boss doesn't want those regulators involved because they will use it as an excuse to expand their reach.

This post is for the US
@_date: 2018-03-14 20:08:36
It was a business, the original company had a 3 million dollar limit per month and 100K  a day withdrawal limit. A customer sold 360 bitcoin over several days right when it reached the 7k to 8K range well before the late quarter take off.  The total was low enough where they should have been able to cash out within a month, but then compliance came in, asked for registration information and lowered the limits even though our AML compliance documents were written by retired IRS agents themselves. That person did not get all their money until 1st Quarter 2018 as a result. This was a face to face transaction so KYC and AML application was stricter than the exchange itself. They asked for Fincen registration, but the company is currently working under an exemption that is under review. It has been open for 7 years and has solid history. Didn't matter,  the limits were reduced without explanation.  
@_date: 2018-03-14 20:48:04
All the of the exchange ask for and check FinCEN registration for your company if you want to resell. If you are not an MSB they act like you can't get higher limits when you say you are an MSB they don't want the competition. This is a very serious issue not to be dismissed. The boss runs two companies and yes you can lie about what you are doing, but you won't get MSB type limits and even if you do, they will audit you and discover you are reselling bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:53:53

You should be using Kraken, they use a third party to send the wire so it does not show up as an exchange. This is a very real issue you are facing.

Then confirms my master public key and asked me to please share it with cosigners. I click next. I select cosigner seed and then I put in my other seed. I click next. I then confirm my password.

Correct, but this is how it's done if you want to use bitcoin. The boss would like to use litecoin with atomic swaps, but an inquiry to the litecoin site was not answered. If you are not already in, you are going to have a hard time getting in. This makes the future look a little bleak. I don't think people know about this issue. Bitcoin and crypto cannot grow in a centralized environment like this. This is in fact banking with an elite. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 03:06:34
I totally agree, the barrier to mass adoption right now is availability to the average non tech savvy person. It is very hard to open a dollar on-ramp exchange and the current exchanges are mostly trying to legislate competition away.

The Blue Diamond Exchange is for USD dollar onramp. There is no current way to get USD on binance from the US. The OTC exchange might be useful when you are cashing out. No holds or stops that you find on coinbase. Its a walk in verification so much faster. Limits are much higher too.

It depends on the amount. It’s higher than coinbase but lower than the ATMS. The cashout is about 1 to 5% but you get it all at the same price so on 1 mil it’s cheaper than selling on an exchange as the price would lower more than that on the sell. Most people use them for the cash-out. Too hard to get your cash on most of these online exchanges.

There are so many new people coming in it’s important to keep this information out there. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 23:29:39
Very rarely and it’s not easy by design.

Properly offline generated paper wallets should be safe. be sure you are offline, do not take the computer back online and make sure your printer never goes online and neither are connected to wifi. If you need to use the computer later, reset it and reinstall. Delete all files beforehand. The printer can never go back online. FTP poses a risk.

Remember this is a Democrat, they hate you, they hate business and they hate choices other than abortion.

Bless your heart: At the Supreme Court level they look at case law and the Bill of Rights.  They also do on the lower courts. Research 4th Amendment rulings on google. It’s still valid. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 06:43:03
Nope not prior to the AML regs. They didn’t know who you were. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 23:37:03
There is always that, but the Bill of Rights cannot be altered by simple legislation. It has to be a super majority of States and legislators. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 06:22:08
Yes I agree with that as well
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:40:43
Not all exchanges in the US turn client info over 
@_date: 2018-12-19 16:00:22
The guy will be writing this off on his taxes this year. Loss due to fraud.

What Wallets do you  recommend? 
@_date: 2018-12-19 15:56:41
Total garbage. You are holding funds with no tangle proof of anything wrong because nothing wrong has happened and you don't even know the case number. This guy buys on exchanges, trades on compliant exchanges and cashed out on exchanges. You are full of crap and are taking the 2BTC because you can. You run a permission wallet. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 15:06:46
This is interesting because yes they can engage in fractional reserve banking. It is for sure worth a study. Any more info? 
@_date: 2018-12-19 16:03:20
You are doing this because you think he is hiding and you will get to keep the funds. You need to come up with something tangible. Where is your Head Quarters located? 
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:51:01
The 4th Amendment stops the transaction harvesting here. Coinbase wants to be a bank so they and the bit-license guys are in hyper compliance. Trust me this is news.

Does the bitcoin wallet generator allow you to make passphrase paper wallets offline ? I do not generate wallets online ever btw nor should you. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 01:37:30
I know what you said 
@_date: 2018-12-19 05:35:47
Yes I agree. How do you feel about exodus and Jaxx? 
@_date: 2018-12-19 16:17:22
You picked a wallet that was funded by various exchanges is all you did. You have no grounds for suspicion here. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:12:29
Loving this!
@_date: 2018-12-15 00:48:00
They would love to use that but they have opposition at this point. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 22:50:04
Here is an article about you btw
@_date: 2018-12-19 05:42:38
Is there a list of SV wallets somewhere? 
@_date: 2018-12-19 15:53:39
Nope you are not even asking for any of the traditional KYC stuff. You are stealing funds. Now you are going to ask for KYC things, but that won't save you. You are stealing.
