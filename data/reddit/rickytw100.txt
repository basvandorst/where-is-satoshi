So the promo is saying it isn't valid...does this mean you aren't actually extending it?

Good for you for making the decision to buy! 
The way i feel is that Id rather take a risk at holding and letting the price climb as high as possible, i haven't risked enough to be upset if i lost it all. 
I feel like the possible/probable reward outweighs my risk. 
However, you should never be ashamed of taking a profit!

Your very right, but at this point, no matter what, i'm better off then I was before.

Me- "BTC just Hit $10, you should totally throw $100 in to it and let it sit."
Friends - "Haha yea totally" (Shaking there head no way)
(6 months later) Me- "hey, you ever buy bitcoins? Can't believe they hit $700!"
Friends - "WTF!!!!"

i never tell anyone how many I actually have, nor do I actually say "I told you so" (it's more of a mental "I told you so" lol) but I figured people in this subreddit would know exactly what i mean.
