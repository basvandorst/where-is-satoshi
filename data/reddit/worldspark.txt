I got into crypto in 2012 only after listening to Andreas. I was kind of pay check to pay check and few hundred in savings. He is so good in what he does that I got absorbed and today I am at the verge of financial freedom. I invested, started going to meet up groups, supported my family, bought a house now will start donating certain percentage from my profit to charities particularly active in education field. 
Andres is amazing to say the least. You are life changer and I am living example of that. I listen to almost all his YouTube lectures, they are so informative,  visionary and top class that I learned and learned and just became crazy about blockchain. I told my friends about crypto in 2013 and was laughed at and almost chased out of town for being ultra stupid. Now the table has turned and all of them came back to me for advice and they want to be in crypto. 
I dedicate my crypto success to Andreas.
I salute you sir for your unwavering spirit. You are a genius. You are a hero and 100 years from now when the world will look back at origins of bitcoin and blockchain, your name will be on the top 10 people.
Thanks once again.

Cannot agree more. Ripple is probably the worse in the eco system as far as thesis is concerned but it is up because bitcoin is slow.
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:45:18
When in 2018? The current performance of network is bad, if LN takes too long, that will hit Bitcoin hard and people will move to other options.

So choose is you pay tax or your kids will pay tax when it appreciates. So no benefit giving kids crypto now even if it appreciates latter 10x.

Please look at its chart since 2019, you will understand. How many it has withstood. Currently bearing a crash time and all chances of survival 100%.
@_date: 2019-03-17 14:32:55
It will be a mistake to look it as a currency only. Bitcoin is much much bigger than that. I am sure we will invent a term to address bitcoin.
At this moment we can call it a system. 
The system that will redefine finance, economic, politics, administration, law, social interactions, and much more.
We a humanity will invent new terminology to discribe it. 
This is very new to human race. 
Sit back, Relax and watch the show.

What r the tax implications of giving her bitcoin now when it is at 4K than giving her at 400k when she grows up?
How would you show that you gave her in March 2019 when price was 4K ? How to put that in tax equation when you file 2019 tax.
@_date: 2019-03-17 15:20:37
- 1 .  Wealth can be generated by many ways, scams and innovation. Bitcoin’s is innovation. Billions is brilliant.
-2 .  Biggest crypto deployment on planet in less than 10 years is hugh milestone, that shows impact, scale and what is to come. 
-3. We agree
-4. The adoption rate is quite good, it is bit slow because of tech hurdles that are being worked on, scale and TPS etc. as layer 2 and beyond is developed the adoption will be massive.
Regulation is pulling it back, custody solutions exists but they look towards regulators and that is a drag. regulation is not bitcoin’s fault. Tech is evolution. 
-5. From developers to Projects manages to educational institutions to online training academies, to social networks, to hackers to security experts, to dapps, to focus groups in almost all mid to high level corporations. Startups. 
Blockchain has created jobs around the world. People also live outside of USA. 
I don’t have a hard data but 100k is a conservative no. Will find hard data.
-6  We Agree
-7. This was not the first crash nor will it be the last. Even after this big crash it is still 4000 times the world reserve currency which is a world reserve currency from almost a century. The big bag holders are coming, recovery is a matter of time as the toxicity madness is almost gone. 
-8. China, Russia, Vietnam, India etc banned it fully or partially. ICOs were banned by many counties. The system still moves on. On the contrary the companies have moved out of unfriendly zones, Binance is an example. USA can try if it wants to but it can only slow it down, delay it a bit but in the end the system will again pop up (in my humble opinion). Keep in
Mind China and India is almost 1/3 of the world population. There ban had no impact. 
History has taught us “No power in the world can stop the idea who’s time has come”.
-9. It will recover, it always has. They declared it dead 250 times and now almost stoped doing it because they have been proven wrong every time.
-10.  Things take time. 
Moreover judging Bitcoin from price point is demeaning and disrespectful towards bitcoin. This is much more than that. 
I am sure we will invent a new term to discribe bitcoin in its entirety. 
Have a Nice day.

Once BTC reaches 100k, people (hodlers) will start spending it. More merchants start accepting it, online and offline, more ATMs. Companies will settle debt in it, etc, people will start lending it to make money.
In this process BTC will create a big vacuum for other currency to fill, lite coin and others will fill in the gap. Then bitcoin will be high level game. 
Apple Pay and others will not kill anything. 
@_date: 2019-10-24 13:19:03
I agree with you mostly. Tech is solid, but tech is not the only thing that matters. The challenge is and will be adoption. For btc to be 10x, 2 things needs to happen. 
1.  Global financial crisis relation to currency and/or financial institutions.
2.  Scaling of btc and making btc easy so that grandma can use it.
1 one can trigger a short term upswing but not sustainable for long term.
If few countries decide to hold bitcoin as reserve and few would like to do partial trade in bitcoin because there own currencies are in crisis , that will be very very bullish. 
Bulgaria has about 200k btc as reserves in there central bank. 
These are all external factors. 
Sooner or latter ethereum will decouple from bitcoin. 
100x days are gone for sure but 10x days, not so much, we will still see 10x is few good coins that will sustain and will survive. 
The key here is in  patience. Next 2-3 years will be very critical for crypto space. 
Also look at it this way - in evolution stage - 2017 was a first wave. This helped in introduction of btc to masses resulting in adoption at some level. Instuitions got interested, academia got interested. New products started building, infrastructure started getting build.
There will be 2nd wave for sure, legislature and regulation will happen, killer app will cause adoption. 
 Talking about price is meaningless. 
In the end your commentary was fair wither I agree 100% or not.

OP congrats 
How much is capital gains tax for long term hold (2 years plus), is it fixed or is it variable depending on profit you make ?
I also started in 2013 and stoped buying in 2014 and still holding. 
I am thinking how good will it be an idea to pay off house now and how can I save on taxes. 
I have zero knowledge about taxes and want to pay them but also want to know best strategy that helps me save money on taxes etc.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:29:49
Bitcoin - ethereum - factom - litecoin 
Spread into these 4 coins , pretty safe bet all the 4 
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:59:59
Replay attack comes into picture if u move your coins, don’t move your coins after the fork for few days 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:30:06
But that will not help if you are holding from more than 1 year as then I believe the taxes are fixed at some percentage. 
Your strategy will work if it is less than an holding period....
This is my best guess ....

Regardless of bitcoin power it was only 6-10 people calling for and off the hard fork.
This alone worries me.
The journey of bitcoin that I am watching since 2012 has seen lot of changes, it has remained strong but far less that what I initially understood and believed.
Let’s see how it progresses in future.

Because Jamie dimon says it is fraud, that is reason enough to buy bitcoin.

I am hearing this economic collapse stories from last 8 years now. This is not happening. There are people who make living from such stories on YouTube claiming that they have been proven correct 99% of time. I used to believe them, some of them publish newsletters and have paid subscribers for their contents. They are out right scammers.
Then there are gold bugs to, they make movies/documentaries on gold claiming gold to be 10k soon and silver to be 600 per ounce. They even gave a prediction date as well but nothing happened now they are like price suppression/manipulation bullshit.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:31:46
He is with Jamie dimon.
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:26:43
I would like to know the name of educated economist U r following.
What reason do they give for collapse? Debt GDP ratio or something else.
Some may also have suggested to ready you emergency kits, food, lights, medicine
Look for caves, bunkers and/or boats, buy gold or silver etc etc.
I know one who used to say that on Fox News channel and very popular one, he also showed his emergency preparedness kit from his apartment. He was predicting blood on streets and what not.
Surprisingly he still has audience following him, lot of it. He has been wrong on almost everything he has said but people still believes him.
Economic collapse , gold 10k , silver manipulation these r old stories....
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:29:35
I would partially agree.  With current rise it could cross 10k and crash is in making and it will come but it will not go to 1k , at best it would go down by 50%, (fork conditions excluded). I am in it since 2012 and not sold a single coin I saw 1200 to 150 crash first hand 250 to 50$ live and system has matured since then.
Trust me it will not go down 90%.

Bottom line they don’t know a thing about bitcoin.

Then how come we only have only one chain split so far. 
I think you can fork as many time as you want and can have separate Bitcoin but it takes some substantial hash power to split chain. 
Forking and chain split are two different events not necessarily together, I may be wrong.

They will not shut down the internet I can guarantee that.  They will gang up and ban Bitcoin and will push it into black market. They will keep that for few years until trust is lost and main stream adoption does not takes . 
Then they will unleash their barking dogs like CNBC, FOX, CNN , Bloomberg etc etc . 
They cannot kill it they know. It they will try to make it ineffective.
Imagine Jamie dimon is next fed chair then he can inflict lot of pain. This will push btc out of the USA but not the rest of the world. 
They will try to kill it as much as possible but will fail, 
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:29:55
Not so easy

Can u please provide a link?

Rule No 2. If you have already said that you have, start crying in public that you sold and took losses. And keep cursing crypto in public.
Rule No 3: make faces that you may go bankrupt.
