agree 
@_date: 2015-06-19 03:12:38


thoughts on this? and i guess i agree but those are just buzzwords and we can still make good choices in the current environment. protests or w/e is not what the game theory optimal moves are
@_date: 2015-06-19 03:10:49
but specifically in the past 6 months the usd crushed the euro gbp and mexican peso where i reside, and bitcoin has broken even. So can a bitcoin buy more milk or less in the past 5 months. or gold or maybe something that doesnt change much in value
@_date: 2015-06-19 03:15:29
so bitcoin vs usd is obsolete? how do we measure the price in a global way? 
@_date: 2015-06-19 03:04:23
Is there a website where i can compare bitcoin to gallons of milk in dif countries. Seems like a cool idea to pair it to gold etc.
@_date: 2015-06-19 03:05:37
It should be paired with everything already. Maybe a store can open up and have its prices based on the bitcoin to milk exchange rate, and then the supplier would have to charge btc too. Whens the first one try it out? I'm too busy.

first the ignore you, then...
this is great news

the same taxes it came from before 1913, before we became debt slaves

he got me for a few btc
@_date: 2014-05-27 04:44:32
imo bitcoin is a ponzi scheme but the the profits are split fairly. im scared of how big it can get and what will happen
@_date: 2014-05-03 13:13:54
yes it is :)

the comments are great. when this many stupid people are against something its good news.
one by one people will switch sides

give it time. they have no power here.

it will only reveal the public addresses. 
check and see what it says, it can show an error, waiting for confirmations or something else
@_date: 2014-05-31 11:07:37
i wouldnt be able to tell you without any information. if it has a fee it should confirm in the next block.
@_date: 2014-09-07 22:23:17

Its funny how no one cares to even respond let alone fight against these regulations. Its like we all know theres nothing we can do.
@_date: 2014-04-28 07:46:22
except bitcoin has had 3 bubbles and 3 crashes and is still going strong. how long will it take the people who fail at math, the people who spend $ on lottery tickets and insurance for their new tv, to realize that its only going up. 3 more bubbles, 4?
@_date: 2014-04-28 08:05:14
one agency probably sold it to another inside the government.
@_date: 2014-05-06 08:16:49
replace china with usa and your paragraph is still true
@_date: 2014-05-31 11:31:17
yea you said that already. it doesnt mean anything without a tx id
@_date: 2014-03-13 21:13:15
agree. Bitcoin is the free market. let them do what they want. the protocol wont be affected.
@_date: 2014-06-01 11:56:35
Pretty good.
Ive been telling people its the highest earning investment in the history of mankind (1c to $600). 
@_date: 2014-05-06 20:31:42
they will have to sell hard assets
@_date: 2014-03-15 17:34:36
do you realize 100% of federal income tax from citizens is used to pay interest on the debt? do you realize its unconstitutional theft? 
@_date: 2014-05-31 09:41:17
whats the tx id
@_date: 2014-05-28 04:33:45
@_date: 2014-05-02 02:15:47
yes, a bitcoin world will mean the end of taxation without consent.
@_date: 2014-03-16 20:52:40
buffet could spend the year buying bitcoin on multiple sites/local bitcoins and then fire sale on the last day to surely win.
@_date: 2014-06-01 14:58:17

i hate when i see the results of surveys like this, the numbers are meaningless. show me a survey using the blockchain or this is nothing better that mainstream media propaganda
@_date: 2014-05-27 04:53:48

youre brock, the first guy talking to the camera
@_date: 2014-06-04 03:24:48
the more realistic fear is what bitcoin will do to governments
@_date: 2014-05-27 04:51:05
yes they can. its the free market. everyone scamming each other with no rules cancels each other out in the long run. enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2015-05-01 18:30:32
what if they get that datacenter and double spend all the time without getting shut down
@_date: 2014-06-11 09:31:51
game theory wise this is retarded and you will soon find out. just add bitcoin to your fiat options, everyone else is. your sales will be much less this year if only in bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-03 07:35:57
it is secret
@_date: 2015-01-26 10:19:51
you can deposit into someones bank account through local bitcoins

i hate this world that you have to have a lawyer to start a business
@_date: 2015-01-26 10:31:43
pick a seller with a high rating, check reviews. some are very high volume so there will be minimal risk
@_date: 2015-07-12 05:06:32
when bitcoin is measured in big macs and the usd goes the way of the zimbabwe dollar
@_date: 2015-09-25 17:48:16
the huge elephant in the room is the multi billion dollar a year darknet markets.
This is the only use case for bitcoin so far. (freedom)
@_date: 2015-10-13 06:06:50
all bitcoin has to do is stay over $1300 for a year and then its time
@_date: 2015-03-25 07:57:39
no i think they are fine
@_date: 2015-10-03 20:39:34
the total gross sales of the darknet market = true spot price
bitstamp average? who knows, they pumped 885 million of stolen money into the system. with sell pressure they can keep it below 500 for x. 
this is ok. this is a value transfer. real world money was stolen, from customers, and created into digital value. 
inflation in btc wont end til 2140. but it will double evey 4 years. good luck.
doesnt some ponzi owner have 200k bitcoins? Its still a jungle out there. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 07:46:28
this is an obvious blockchain.info shill post 
@_date: 2015-03-25 07:50:34
yea maybe not. gl man 
@_date: 2015-02-22 12:34:59
you keep saying 2.0 but you never say what it is
@_date: 2015-10-03 23:16:12
but having a lower cost allows for higher risk. transfer fees will find its spot price somewhere between the bitcoin network fees and what it is now.
venmo is doing sick. but it can get cheaper
still years away imo. the halving will be a big event.
@_date: 2016-07-06 08:12:12
because an assets price always settles very close to the cost of producing it. gl.
@_date: 2013-10-21 13:24:21
really enjoyed this. intelligent guys for sure. thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:15:51
give it time. bitcoin has a plan for you
@_date: 2013-10-22 16:35:54
@_date: 2013-10-21 23:23:19
bitcoin isnt a currency. it is a cancer on the banking system. it will keep taking value from fiat until there is none left. the war has just begun

@_date: 2013-11-20 19:59:30
this and its also not heavily manipulated like the precious metal markets. 
9 million percent increase in 4 years is not a bad return
@_date: 2013-12-08 13:45:01

@_date: 2013-10-28 23:09:46
youre right. my mistake. edit: i searched the hot and new pages not the search function. imo the post you linked received little visibility
@_date: 2013-11-09 04:47:58
