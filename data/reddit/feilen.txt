I'm having the problem that I think dogecoin is awesome on principle, but the meme itself started to wear on me about a month ago :/
@_date: 2014-02-08 10:56:57
Wait, where can you tell them to cancel the withdrawal?
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:44:04
That's probably why I'm still playing TF2...
@_date: 2014-02-08 12:21:30
I might just sit on the transfer, fairly certain it's been only two months at this point.

Down with Gox! Just let me get my coins out first please :&lt;
@_date: 2014-02-11 00:29:36
Would be great if I could get my coin out :|
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:01:12
Commenting to save this for tonight. I want my coins! 
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:39:04
Stupid high resolution available? Awesome! I can use my neat scaling algorithms on it &gt;:3
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:05:49
If I can withdraw my 1.8 from it, I don't care.

We need to show them we are mature, responsible individuals. Break out the felt-tip pens and get moustachin'
@_date: 2014-02-11 02:29:38
Ideally, less. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 21:06:42
Different machine, and I don't ever glance at that page. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:38:46
Perhaps that's true for the opposite. It was funny when I first encountered it. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:13:46
I've can never say I've felt sorry for someone who made me lose over a thousand dollars before. But honestly, minus the screwups, he seems exactly like what I would be in that position.
@_date: 2012-01-22 04:23:54
7? Yes. 20? Hopefully not for a while, I'd rather they have more stability
@_date: 2012-01-28 06:23:08


Not sure if too much or not enough credit. 
@_date: 2012-01-28 10:43:49
"Inhalable caffeine" Uh, that sounds... deadly o.o
@_date: 2012-01-16 21:40:18
You are a nice person.
@_date: 2012-12-28 08:03:20
I got one too! My dad got me one, since I had been talking about them for like two months.
Note of warning: They are exactly as cool looking as they seem on the website.
@_date: 2011-11-15 09:53:19
I hate when I read a really passionate post on here and understand absolutely none of it.
@_date: 2011-11-22 04:38:40
I wanted to do this too! Unfortunately, the selling side as well...

[Caveman science fiction.](
@_date: 2011-11-23 09:32:35
Imma give it a try! :D
EDIT: Worked great! Good way to earn if you can't yet transfer.
@_date: 2011-11-29 15:49:41
Is this also over on I need to upvote it!
@_date: 2011-11-08 19:13:51
'Listen to the song, you little brat. You should know just how much pain you've caused in this world, in your short, pathetic life.'
So much pain and sorrow following someone around on a page of a website?
@_date: 2011-11-23 09:46:27
I think ze meant 'get rich quick scheme'. AKA... another word for a scam? There's no way to describe making money quickly in a positive light apparently.
@_date: 2011-11-14 08:13:34
I'm at least going to give it a try... when I have money again...
@_date: 2011-10-23 18:39:27
Lot of downvotes on this. fox614 probably didn't make the article... ze's just pointing it out.
@_date: 2011-11-21 19:49:05
I then, instead of arguing, was intrigued as to how you intend to do that.
@_date: 2011-11-19 05:36:22
Hah, I missed the glider.
@_date: 2011-11-10 21:27:22
I have exactly 0.00 BTC.
I thought it appropriate that I should have as much BTC as I have USD.
@_date: 2013-10-02 03:07:41
Barefoot shoes are amazing. Shoosh.
@_date: 2013-03-27 22:48:43
I would totally buy more hats in bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-23 01:19:36
@_date: 2013-02-18 04:14:54
I own &lt;3 btc
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:34:01
1 BTC = $75...
@_date: 2013-08-15 01:19:29
Actually could you send those to me? My PC is full of cobwebs.
@_date: 2013-03-24 02:47:38
I'm completely aware what it's about, I was using the magical art of sarcasm.
@_date: 2013-08-01 02:17:40
Lesse, support Warner Brothers or promote 4chan? o.o
And BTC is about as anonymous as cash. Not untracable, but pretty hard and you need previous data. I'm not sure that would tie in well.
@_date: 2013-03-12 07:25:03
It looks to be back up already. It dropped massively... then more or less bounced back it seems.
@_date: 2013-03-23 21:25:51
Is the second statement about the store or about Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-02-09 19:55:54
Or Rationalwiki for anything rational-related. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:05:40


@_date: 2013-03-31 08:52:36
Someone suggested earlier... At the time I thought it wouldn't eventually need to be a thing.
@_date: 2013-03-23 17:23:53
You should bitcointip him. Just to *spite* him.
@_date: 2013-03-30 07:26:52
Oh hey Reddit gold! Oh hey ACTUAL MONEY!
@_date: 2013-04-08 01:01:06
Ahaha, I own, in total, one bitcoin.
And about $10 in my wallet. 
@_date: 2013-01-30 10:09:52
Don't get my hopes up like that.
