Very funny, ahah

That's true but some things must never change. Whatever could happen.

I don't really understand how is it possible to create a paper wallet offline. If you do that, how does the bitcoin network know that you own the address you've generated ?
@_date: 2014-04-15 01:31:30
Well, that is simply their answer. Maybe they don't care at all but given the time it cost me (5 sec) I've thought it was worth trying, even if it is just about adding one occurrence on their statistical data.

The DarkWallet team said that it will be ready when it will be ready.
They apparently can't tell us a precise deadline as they want to release a perfect product. And I think that's pretty wise from them. :)
@_date: 2014-07-09 17:55:15
Great! Thank you! :)

True, especially when you're trying to target small businesses. This subscription package is not optimal considering the small volume of transactions made with Bitcoin for now.
@_date: 2014-06-02 14:24:35
No, I would have been aware of that because I'm still close enough to the situation...
@_date: 2014-04-06 07:47:46
This threshold should not be a goal. If Bitcoin happens to be valued a lot more in the future, it would be an unreachable goal that will be frustrating for many people. I think the Bitcoin community should start thinking in mBTC. mBTC is cheap: only $0.460!

Well... What about all the zombie coins ?
This chart is completely false if you didn't make an hypothesis to take them into account.

Okay so I've just sent them a message telling them that I want to pay using Bitcoin and here is what they answered (in a very fast manner) :








































@_date: 2014-04-08 13:56:50
I haven't either. It seems too risky for me to deposit any funds on it as it is still in pre-alpha...
@_date: 2014-06-19 14:49:39
There's also Paymium. A French one.
@_date: 2014-04-10 18:11:45
Yes, and they may apparently still change this privacy policy in the future. So nothing is sure.
Bitcointip has just fucked up its reputation. That's sad.
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:20:13
Why don't you simply install it on your computer in order to test yourself?
I've just done it and it's cool :).
@_date: 2014-04-09 20:18:40
I don't know why you're getting downvoted... He's right, one day may comes where it will be necessary to add more decimals to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:04:47
CoinJoin is not decentralised for now but it doesn't seem to be a problem. Furthermore it may be decentralised in the future.
DarkCoin is a weak altcoin (for now) and it will have a bad image so it will absolutely never gonna be used as much as Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-08 18:52:10
Je ne pense pas. Une meilleure traduction serait : Bitcoin sur la lune !
@_date: 2014-04-06 08:19:47
I'm interested. Where will you publish your paper?
@_date: 2014-04-06 07:42:44
I don't know why you think people would prefer to handle 10-20-30 cryptos instead of one or two cryptos. People would accept only cryptos that could be easily spend thereafter.
Don't forget that concerning currency, there is a strong network effect that'll make people accept, or not, others cryptos.
@_date: 2014-04-15 01:29:54
Well, you don't have to be rude. That is simply their answer. Maybe they don't care at all but given the time it cost me (5 sec) I thought it was worth trying, even if it just about adding one occurrence on their statistical data.
Try to be polite next time.

You've just participated to the gox fundraising, thanks for helping us all :).
@_date: 2014-04-09 20:26:26
It is possible. Bitcoin will just need to be updated and this kind of update is not a big deal.

I'm listening this music too. I've a sensation that it's gonna last very long...
@_date: 2014-04-09 21:59:46
By saying that this is not a big deal, I was meaning that this update is not a controversial update that could be hard to adopt for miners so it could be done smoothly.
@_date: 2014-04-10 18:13:01
1% withdrawals is still very expensive for big tips! You should really use some thresholds or something!
@_date: 2016-06-21 10:37:08
What about his positions? How can he close them and avoid too much losses?
@_date: 2015-04-25 13:54:53
Hey !
@_date: 2016-07-17 21:36:44
Poloniex and Bitfiniex. I don't know about the others.
