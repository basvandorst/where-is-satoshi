I have been buying and selling crypto for three years. This article doesn’t say it’s going to disappear, but it’s literally worth zero currently until it is federally regulated in some manner. When you can walk into your neighborhood store and use it. If it is so great why aren’t people holding on to it, instead of changing it right back to their current currency? Explain that to me. Until then I am pretty sure my article is the least pretentious argument you can find.

It’s not about owning a fraction of a tulip. It’s how economics works. Prices go up and up and up and eventually nobody can afford it or doesn’t want to spend that much money on something, then what happens? The price drops and drops and drops until it hits complete shit. The person who invented this holds 500,000-1,000,000 units of bitcoin. So they decide to completely fire sell all of their units to the market. What effect does that have on the price? It crashes 60-80% of the value of BTC. People lose that much value in their portfolios because of that individual. As that price plummets people aren’t sure whether to buy or not because it could continue to plummet, so it’s not a wise investment. So it continues to plummet and it becomes absolute shit and becomes to the same value as any other world currency. I have made money off of this and have done quite well, but I also understand the dangers of stocks and investing. You have a time where you have billions of people jumping on this bandwagon that know absolutely nothing about investing and can get themselves in trouble. They have no escape plan and they keep their money in an exchange or don’t understand margins, etc. there’s a difference between an enthusiast and an actual investor. Right now you’re in a market full of enthusiasts and can crash it just as much as the guy that has the most control.

With these feat of net neutrality in America, you don’t think it will have any effect? ������

Look another guy that saw it coming, it’s going to continue to fall and fall and fall. I made my money and got out. Now you don’t know what to do. It hurts doesn't it? Your hopes dashed, your dreams down the toilet. And your fate is sitting right besides you. ������

I never said I didn’t believe in it one bit, did you read fully what I wrote? Be smart about it all that’s it. As far as gold and silver, many places take it as payment across the country still. There’s no hate against bitcoin just people need to be smart about their approach and not put every last penny they have into something that can go horribly wrong instantly.

I decided to write this a few days ago concerning BTC and other cryptocurrencies, enjoy the read and if you have questions about it, feel free to ask: Also like and share this article if you enjoy the read!
Between the years of 1634 and 1637 there was a similar phenomenon to our modern-day Bitcoin (BTC) that we are currently experiencing. It was known as Tulip Mania where the Dutch blew up the price of this flower because of the rarity of it and the increased demand. In one month, the prices inflated just over 2,000% and people were given anything and everything they owned to get a piece of the action. Again, we are seeing something similar with the emergence of cryptocurrencies, but what protected the Dutch and what is protecting us today with these prices? The answer: nothing at all.
Sure, even I have jumped on the bandwagon of buying and selling these currencies and have enjoyed every minute of it, but just as Tulip Mania, we are eventually going to face this infamous “bubble” that major economists are rambling on about. Tulips at their initial release to the Dutch community became a luxury item, where bulbs were being sold at almost 10x what a normal laborer was making during that period. You are certainly seeing something similar with BTC and other coins and the growth that is happening daily. Many are projecting BTC to reach into the million-dollar mark for a single BTC, which at that point even the wealthiest 10% in the world can’t even afford. 
We have reached the point that the tulip market reached in November of 1636, futures are starting to be offered on BTC and guess what followed 3 months later? The most abrupt “bubble” popping and a complete market crash. Community members had sold of their homes, livestock, and even the last few bucks they had to their name to acquire these tulips. As the market for BTC continues to grow, even the most basic individuals are putting their minimum wage checks into these exchanges and wallets in hopes of striking it rich, just as their predecessors have done in the past and are currently doing. Apparently, the world never learned from Tulip Mania or the great depression, where people lost everything because they were putting their money in places without any security and ultimately lost every bit of their monetary lives. Maybe it could be put into a simpler comparison of what bitcoin is. 
If you have a smart phone, you most likely have downloaded games such as candy crush or clash of clans with those pesky in app purchases for their “currencies.” Probably wondering where I am going with this and you might already know what is being implied. All you have is some in-app currency that you get to play with daily and make a few bucks on, but, it’s just a game. Some guy that literally nobody knows, created some currency and got a lot of people to believe in it, but not really. People purchase these coins and then sell them to get their everyday fiat money in return. If you truly believe in these currencies, why are you not holding on to them and why can’t you spend them at your neighborhood market? All everyone is doing, is making this guy “Satoshi” extremely rich and whenever this guy decides that he’s had enough and the game is over; he just goes “click” and shuts everything done and has ultimately schemed everyone out of trillions of dollars and everyone is left looking at a computer screen with no money in their bank account and wondering what they are going to do going forward. 
So, if you are going to get into the game, make sure you know what you are doing and have a plan to get out. You may think I am being a hypocrite because I myself have bought into this, but I have also received my initial investment back and just playing profits. I want everyone to have fun and make a little bit of extra money, but if you believe that this will ultimately take over currencies around the world, you have another thing coming. Until “Satoshi” comes forward, there is public backing of these coins, and the market accepts it everywhere; be careful and invest wisely. Until then, you are playing the ultimate game of monopoly and “Satoshi” owns all 32 homes on the board. Good Luck!

I heard about Tulip mania at a poker game and read into it. It’s the easiest thing to compare it to and that what u wanted.

No assumptions at all. What is the difference between the coins people buy on clash of clans and bitcoin? Nothing at all. I have been doing crypto for three years. It’s not going to disappear, but it will definitely have a dramatic step back eventually. When people can’t afford to buy them, price will dramatically drop and those that own fractions or even full bitcoins are going to lose all their money because of the drastic change. Adam Smith’s invisible hand will have just as much effect on crypto currency as anything else in the world economy. Nobody can’t ever control that.

I do like your reply, I was sincerely making an observation that explains to people to be careful because it could be pulled away from them immediately. I have been buying and selling crypto for three years. I’ve also made enough that I’m using pure “in the black” money these days with it. I was getting at the fact that the poorest people are trying to utilize it as a get rich scheme and they are sadly mistaken. I also was explaining it has zero value until it is regulated and accepted everywhere, until then clash of clans coins have the same extrinsic value as bitcoin and the likes.
