Great work, you deserve a break. Lets see who else picks up the torch.

Simplifying bitcoin transactions for the layman is a really important thing, glad to see more tools like this coming out...

Great, how was it sent? Any electronic message can be IP tracked and IP addresses can be geolocated. Furthermore, reply to them with demands of proof of threat, i.e. as I described in another comment, photos of you or your family members going about their daily lives, at work, at school, in your house. If they can't manage that, they're merely bullshit artists. If they can, then a) the photos have data embedded in them that can be traced, and b) provides more opportunity for IP tracing as well, and c) you have actionable information you can take to the FBI. Taunt them. Bully them back. Make them put up or shut up.

Another reason why this is fake is that a professional extortion attempt would provide proof of threat, i.e. photos of you and your family going about your daily lives, pics of your kids on the playground, you and your family in your house through your windows, that sort of thing to prove they're watching you and can get at you.

I'm running for NH House of Representatives, and intend to sponsor a bill that not only refuses to regulate bitcoin itself, but requires the state and local governments to accept bitcoin in payment for any taxes, fees, excises, or fines, and for state chartered banks to provide bitcoin services to their customers.
I can use all the support I can get.

This sounds like some BS from a 12 year old, or a sad attempt at disinformation from a government psyops agent. Firstly, the real mafia doesn't call themselves the mafia, they use terms like "omerta" and "cosa nostra", etc,  ergo by definition, this 'threat' is fake.
