Yes, that's right. And they are using unencrypted connections, like 99% of the websites that offer a HTTPS service. Their unencrypted connection serves only one purpose: to redirect to the encrypted connection. That's a flaw that exists for backward compatibility.
[HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)]( and browser hardcoded HSTS rules are an attempt to fix the problem.
That said, if you are browsing the website through Tor Browser, then you are safe since Tor Browser won't even try to access HTTP (unencrypted) by default, because of the "HTTPS everywhere" plugin. Unfortunately, not everyone is using Tor Browser to use the Tor network.

Well the attack vector they are talking about is a MITM (Man-In-The-Middle) executed by the exit node.
Since the localbitcoins webapp is offering a HTTP service (that usually only redirects to the HTTPS service) the Tor exit node can execute a MITM attack.
In that case a Tor exit node can see and modify the content of localbitcoins' web pages which could lead in your bitcoins beeing stolen if e.g. they modify bitcoin adresses displayed on the website.
This problem is easily preventable by using a browser that redirects you to HTTP over TLS (a.k.a. HTTPS) websites by default (which is the case of the Tor Browser IIRC) or by going directly to the HTTPS versions of the websites you wish to browse.
That's a security threat, not only for localbitcoins, but for every websites accessed through the Tor network. However you should be fine if you are using the Tor Browser.
