It would've cost me $200 in transactions fees to move my bitcoin from a non-Segwit wallet to an Electrum Segwit wallet, my exchange won't send bitcoin into an address that is true Segwit because it considers it invalid, and even Bitcoin Core doesn't offer a Segwit wallet.  So go fuck yourself.  I'm not to blame.

Hit me in the feels.  I got goosebumps.

This is the kind of stuff that should be on the front page.

They fear the people too much to outright ban it, but they will regulate and insert just as much FUD as they need to suppress and control the price.  Also not banning it means they can sell ahead of their own FUD and buy back in at the lows.  The Korean government considers crypto a menace, but you might have a friend in the Korean people.  The problem is that the herd is scared easily and they will sell whenever the government butts its head in.  Also Korea has banned all foreigners and minors from trading, so there is at least a partial ban.  Don't rest your hopes on Korea.  There is really nothing here to be bullish about.

Dude, $30000 in bitcoin is soon to be about one bitcoin.  Plenty of people have that.

There was a story on this subreddit not too long ago about people paying their rent in bitcoin in Thailand.  Also people are selling their houses for bitcoin, so you wouldn't even need a mortgage, you could just buy the house outright.

I've heard of Shinhan Bank wanting to offer vault service for bitcoin and remittance through a start-up called Streami, but I think it's an exaggeration to say that banks with an 's' are adopting Bitcoin in Korea.

It costs a lot in equipment and electricity to mine bitcoin.  Miners can't sell it for less than a certain price.  Predicting a 95% drop is frankly idiotic at this point.

Damn bro, chill.  Nothing that happens next week can reduce how much bitcoin you have.

Right, it was just another attack and attempted takeover by a hostile fork of Bitcoin, this time with the apparent complicity of a major exchange.  Nothing to get upset about. /s

FUD.  The prohibition is against concealment of an account at a financial institution, not against the ownership of bitcoin.  I'm not saying I agree with this bill or with anything the American government does, but I don't see how you're getting a "ban on Bitcoin" from it.  But go ahead and call your senator to express your support of cryptocurrency.  Some good might come from that.  It would be nice if an actual lawyer could chime in instead of John Q. Reddit.

Having an account on an exchange is different from having the keys to some bitcoin.  It sounds like the bill is concerned with the former, not the latter.

$10 a bitcoin is the dumbest thing I've ever heard, regardless of what the U.S. does.

Sure, but it needs to be understood that there are fees and hidden costs associated with cash, credit cards, bank accounts, etc. too.  Bitcoin transaction fees are just more in your face.  Also as someone who recently spent two weeks downloading the entire blockchain, we can't be putting everyone's daily coffee purchase on it, I'm sorry.  Finding ways to fit more transactions into smaller blocks and offchain solutions are more important than a discount on fees.

Don't get cocky, kid.  There's still a war on.

Lightweights.  A bitcoin costs $11700 in Korea.

This 'crash' as you call it has nothing to do with the fundamentals of Bitcoin, only with vague pronouncements from a communist regime that could all end up being rescinded in time anyway.  If anything Bitcoin will be stronger for not being bound up so tightly with China.  Since when is sell low 'tried and true investment advice'?  If you don't have the balls to hold a volatile commodity then sell it yourself but don't try to induce a panic in everyone else.
