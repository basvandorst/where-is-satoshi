I think they're referring to the fraud protection program.

Huh? How is bitcoin *not* blockchain bullshit? Isn't this kind of like saying "Bearish on cars, bullish on Ford"?

It's really not. I, like most Americans, pay no monthly fees and can also send money to any other bank account in the world with no fees. I believe you're just hearing from a crowd that likes to trump up charges against the fiat system.

Okay, I understand what you meant originally. "Blockchain bullshit" doesn't mean *everything* that uses blockchain, but things that use blockchain just to jump on the hype train and it's a bad fit for the problem. Like IBM.

Japan continues to amaze me with the sheer spectrum of things they will sell under the same brand.

Oh hey, it's the guy who doesn't understand what's going on and resorts to the "WE'RE ALL WINNERS!!1" strategy.

LOL, the only part you have right is when you say "not at all" in response to whether you understand anything.

Ironically, you don't matter now and you won't matter in 30 years just because you fell for a pyramid scheme rofl.

Oops, I thought you were a cryptard for a second there. Yes, we are in agreement. Crypto whales are playing a wholly different game than the average reddit schmo, which is what I meant to point out.

The next gen of rich aren't blowing their money on crypto at all, rofl.

What a surprise, a bitcoiner who doesn't understand economics.
