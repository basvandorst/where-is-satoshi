Co-op credit union.  Shared branching... whatever the name is.  I'd be shocked if you couldn't find a credit union linked to another in almost any major city for simple deposit or withdrawal requests.

Basically prove to the IRS you tried your best to be accurate and not cheat them?

Wouldn't setting a basis of zero give you the highest tax?  Or are you saying you only paid ~$0.50/BTC, so your basis may as well be zero and not worth the time to figure out?

Just in time for the legacy bundles... I don't have a substantial holding, but until a few weeks ago the 0.07 I had left couldn't buy much.  Now I can spend it on a free game!! (No sarcasm at all, thanks for the post)

I'd join in if I had read the rules on coinbase, and verified BEFORE I did a buy order.  Maybe next week... but I'll still post a shameless comment for reddit gold, I'm not above it.

Eh, I can't blame the people cashing out 5x their initial investment, and still having 2-3 times their initial investment still in bitcoins.

I'd call you lucky, but my dad always said "you make your own luck". Pretty sure that's true here.
Nice job creating your own luck... you lucky son of a bitch. Sitting on 2.2BTC already.
I'll accept what you say as fact, but the internet has me skeptical of things - How much of it did you or someone you know send to get the ball rolling?
edit: also, if you're wanting to say thanks, I'm sure everyone would agree wouldn't mind an extra 0.1 or something.

holy shit... 2 people sent $5k+ USD!?!? please really give it to seansoutpost.  The 2.2BTC is more than enough beer money for you.

we're getting downvoted for asking someone who just got $22,000 to donate to seansoutpost?!?!
