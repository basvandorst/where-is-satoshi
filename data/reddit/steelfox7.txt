What made you decide on 1000 BTC to one person, instead of 10 BTC 100 people etc?

Two deer walk out of a gay bar and one goes to the other and says "man, I must have blown about 30 bucks in there!"

I'll give this a shot:

Try contacting their support. Coinbase owed me for a dozen referrals and when I tried recently they came through

  Why isn't your referral system working?  I had a friend buy a bitcoin under my referral two weeks ago and we both have not received a bonus. I got in touch with your customer service which took a week to tell me that they weren't sure why this was happening but they would look into it. No further feedback (it's been a week).

Awesome! Thanks!

I have had the same issue (delays with my deposit caused me to lose out on almost 2 BTC when price spiked) and no response going through their technical support.
If you are in the US, I highly recommend BitFloor - Go to any Bank of America, deposit the cash and it credits within 15 minutes.
Sorry about funds, I feel your pain.

I use the bitcoin-qt wallet on my computer. The wallet is encrypted and I have multiple backs up. Lets say my hard drive crashes and I get a new computer. How do I take the encrypted .dat file on to the new computer?
How often should I back up my wallet. I have heard anywhere between 1-100 transactions or wallet addresses.

You haven't had fast time with Bitfloor?  I usually get my funds deposited in &lt; 15 minutes.
@_date: 2013-03-16 13:36:33
That looks very interesting - have you had any personal experience with it?
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:12:00
Love the fact that you cashed out your initial investment and are working with pure profit now. I am still new to bitcoin and wish I got into them when they were much cheaper, but will keep this in mind in (hopefully) a couple years when I cash out. 
Best decision you made was the color choice of your car. Enjoy the ride man.

Looking forward to trying it out. I like the concept!

I have used bitinstant before in the past, however I no longer trust it after trying to get in my money when the price was low and a long delay with my funds cost me a coin or two when the price jumped. 
This is in stark contrast to BitFloor - when you fund through the company LocalTill, I have without fail gotten my money deposited in my account within 15 minutes.

awesome!  Thanks!
