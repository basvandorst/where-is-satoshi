Yo! I had a similar issue with Gemini. My money was lost in space for 24 days. BoA told me they have confirmation for Gemini's bank that my money was deposited into their account. I sent messages on to their support team, on FB, and finally on Twitter. Then I emailed them a final letter stating I will be taking legal action against them. The funds were in my account the very next day. Threaten to take this to a legal matter. Also, I wouldn't get a lawyer, I would go straight to your local police and file a theft report. If you have confirmation from BoA that Coinbase's bank received the funds, then it's theft. Good luck! 
I am not a lawyer and this is what worked for me. Everyone has different outcomes to their situation but good luck.

Right there with you! Today I emailed them an Intent to take legal action if they don't return my money. I wired 25K and the same run around bullshit story they gave you. I don't know what the issue is but its been 22 days now and I can't wait any longer. They at least emailed, but they said they didn't see it in their account and that I should get them the fed id number for the wire. I did, I sent it, then silence and haven't heard anything. I cancelled my wire and my bank said that Silvergate bank acknowledges that Gemini received my money. The issue is that Silvergate bank cannot take the funds from Geminis account without them saying its ok. I believe even Silvergate, their own bank, can't get a response from Gemini. WTF!!!!

They sent you that answer when you asked about a wire transfer? Why would they respond with that? I dont know what to do other than seek legal action.
