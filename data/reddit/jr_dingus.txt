Yes, someone gave it to me. Do you have anymore questions about my personal life? You seem really interested in me.

No, I’ve owned bitcoin since 2011, but I hope this comment made you feel smart or validated or whatever. Not sure why my question merits this type of asshole response

Once you have your own BTC wallet set up, it’s really easy to transfer from one wallet to another. You will have an identification number and QR code associated with your wallet, and you just need to enter that information and you can send BTC immediately.

Probably not. Every app &amp; service I know of requires validating your identity with IDs and your bank accounts which can sometimes take days or weeks. There are a lot of hoops to jump through. You may need to have a parent hold your BTC for you until you are 18.

Pay her in cash and tell her to buy her own damn bitcoin.

But doesn’t that mean he probably intends to hold for a while? And isn’t that a positive sign?

Tax cuts do add to the deficit if we are not doing anything else to shrink it, which is exactly what’s happening here. The deficit isn’t determined by any one single factor, our economy is vastly complex. You’re being reductive to try to make an ideological point.
And deficits in general aren’t necessarily bad. We need to make investments in our society and our economy so that it can continue to grow and be prosperous. The problem is we are not making those investments, we’re  just propping up the market artificially.
Libertarianism is a freshman philosophy class ideology that has never had any practical application anywhere in the world and it never will.
