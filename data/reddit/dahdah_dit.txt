Well, it can and it seemingly is.
On top of that, human prosperity the last couple of decades have been at an all time high. Violence and war is measurably less and poverty has globally gone down.
Now it is, of course, still not perfect. But why try and introduce the digital equivalent of all the past economic and political mistakes humanity has made in the past so that a handful of morally dubious individuals can grab a quick buck at the expense of lesser fortunate populations? 
If we have learned anything, it is that curtailing such activities is a prime mover in lifting the economical floor for everybody.
Bitcoin is a step backwards.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:02:10
I doubt that economic freedom is really an attribute of crypto currency at least not for the majority of people who lack the means to get involved with it. I hope you are not so delusional that you imagine the cacao farmer in south America or the cattle herder in deep Africa can actually partake in this little scheme and actually get any value transaction out of it.
It also is a false dichotomy to state that either a controlled or a decentralized form of currency is either ethically sound or not. As it stands, a controlled monetary system does seem better, more social, less volatile and proven contrary to this crypto currency experiment. I imagine/realize that sometimes state controlled mints are not ideal, but in most cases they sure are a lot better than a volatile unhinged and unchecked bubble.
In the end it boils down to what is the most stable representation of value of work. In Bitcoins case, this seems to be how much joules you have wasted on a feeble proposition, whereas a normal currency actually has something of worth to show for it in the end.
It is quite clear which one is ethically in the right and which one should be considered an enemy of reason and logic. Bitcoin is a bubble, a danger and should be forbidden.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:58:35
It most likely is a bubble, albeit a very unique one in the sense that normally bubbles tend to have something fundamentally of value to begin with, call it the soapy water.
Bitcoin does not even have that, so as it stands it is just expanding into a void without any medium between the void and the assumption of value.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:07:19

My first mobile I bought in 1991 and I had broadband in the mid nighties. I was an early adopter on a lot of tech that I thought had merit. Unfortunately the Internet gave people like you the idea that your opinions where of any value or consequence and it gave rise to the new populism that we see in the UK and US today so perhaps I could have been a bit more critical of general internet use back then seeing as that isn't turning out so great.
Other than that, I'm a historian mostly and what I see when idiots like you say "the future is happening in front of your eyes" or a similar vacuous remark that is completely meaningless and a total non-arguments, is a person that has either no clue or interest in seeing things outside of their preferred context. A context that almost certainly is bullshit without any fundamental grain of truth to it at all.
I see some sap that is willingly making the same mistakes a myriad of people before him/her have made for some speculative personal gain, damn the consequences.
You want to know what guy I am? I'm the same guy that, when you done fucked up, has to remind you not to be a stupid dick again until you grow arrogant enough to ignore me and stumble all over again. I am the guy who is going to say "I told you so" when your world comes crashing down in a flaming pile of stupid.
New tech simply isn't by default "better". It's a product of humans and that makes it suspect and in need of suspicion and skepticism. (and the same goes for the mindless zombies who peddle it without question.. AKA you!)

It is not a matter of vision, but rather a matter of being realistic and getting your priorities straight.
On average we need 12 panel on a typical house in a typical environment. This does not cover transport or industry. It also does not work everywhere.
Solar farms are great, but also infra-structurally burdensome. These do not alleviate the issues in areas that need it the most. As it is a solar farm is the same as a solar community, just with a different distribution concept.
The point is that our priority should be to replace as much fossil with solar as we possibly can within the next 2 decades to have a chance at all.
Wasting the equivalent of 9 households energy expenditure a day on a single arbitrary transaction of fake monetary faith units is not something we should even consider. It is a bad idea period.

ASICs are not a magical component that magically do not use energy or time. Application specific IC's have existed for decades and these follow the same laws of thermodynamics that all electronics do. You could as well shouted randomly "Quantum computing!" and it would be equally uninformed and stupid on your part.
Most mining rigs, especially home gamers, use GPU's for mining this pipedream. Only the bigger mining companies are able to distribute fast clusters of dedicated silicon and even with that, the performance increase over GPU implementations is rather lackluster.
Fact remains that the major pools are largely comprised out GPU based algorithms and this means that the average transaction on the network wastes as much energy as 9 US households use in 1 day.
If you wait 3 months, this will be 15 days and if you would then replace all the small operators with data centers full of ASIC gear, you might lower that to 12 if you are lucky.
Unfortunately that gain will probably be wasted by highly inefficient mining-malware or websites that employ a JS miner on users computers and phones. These are so terribly poor that you can add perhaps 10 more days to the tally.
No, the problem is that Blockchain is a bad idea and needs to stop now.

You fail to understand. The point is that would it ever come to come to a point where we would need to default to a simple bartering system, you'd have no need for petrol because there would not be any merit in running a car. You'd be lucky if you has a horse to plough a field with.
But that scenario would be infinitesimally better than the more likely alternative and as it stands, Bitcoin is actively promoting this scenario to play out.

I know I have a pretty good grasp on these matters. Your feeble argument-less assertion that I do not only shows you personal bias(at best).
The time it takes and the proof of work needed at this moment means that the bandwidth of the network is tiny and the energy expenditure is ridiculous. 
I'm sure you do understand that adding more nodes to the network in this case does not mean an efficiency increase at all. It means more work and energy to reach consensus and it will take longer diminishing bandwidth even more.
If the bubble does not pop before, the energy requirements for a single transaction will double in the first quarter of the next year. Unless you have some secret information about a radical new GPU architecture for next year that will do the work for a tenth of the cost, I say it is YOU that is talking out of you ass.
The point is that we do not need to waste any energy, especially electricity, on these speculatory experiments. We are trying to replace as much traditional energy sources with solar and if Bitcoin continues, somewhere next year the network will use 1% of all the electricity humanity uses. This is an enormous energy setback and a stupid risk to take.
Bitcoin simply, at this time, is incompatible with the goals we have set to at least have a shot at a livable planet. Your short term hobby/personal possible wealth should not hinder these goals.

No! smart sheep.. Sheep not imitating a lemming diving head first off a ponzi scheme hill!
People like you who think that crying "sheep" because something does not suit your personal preference are fucking idiots.

It is not a dip, it is a pop.. And it is good because it will mean that rooting out this unregulated crypocurrency malarkey and making it illegal will be much easier.

Is that fork-bomb loser still pretending he understands (crypto)-currency.. What a nut job.

What a nonsensical tin foil hat statement.. I do not have debt!

Nope, it is a race to the bottom and good riddance. Shady, shammy unecological pipe dreams are not welcome.

WTF? Did you read the brain dead nonsense you typed? You are fucking lunatic! Da fuck would your dumb ass presume to know about me? Your ridiculous plonker!

Better than the money laundering mob and drug dealers trying to keep BTC alive!

Same thing.. 
I don't think some hysterical nobody on the intarwebs like you is a solid source of historical context and its implications. I fact, I know it is not.
In fact, it is rather ironic that a clueless fantasist like you lot would cite that particular historical context so fallaciously to me with this "question" you think is so remarkably relevant. On your stupid virtual high horse you quote 1929 at me whilst your moronic lawless unchecked criminal digital currency pet at this very moment is worth less than the energy it consumes!! You utter fool...

If what you say is true, which it isn't because you are a clueless fuck-wit, crypto currency scams are a myriad times worse than that.

I have no debt, you tin-foil hat wearing idiot!
