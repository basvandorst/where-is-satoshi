I used them for 4 years without issue, they have been holding over 50k in USD from me for over 20 days with no answer to support tickets and when I asked for an address for my attorney to send them a letter I was hung up on. I hope you do not have any issues with them, but this is fair warning about how they handle this type of customer issue.

I’m a merchant using bitcoin for the first time. Sell 3 big ticket items using their invoice tool. Due to lag or something else, the payment by the customer registered as a mispayment which does not allow the cash to be transferred to USD and rather stays in my account as bitcoin. This is a huge issue as my daily limits are not allowing me to cash out and bitcoin just dropped 10%. As a merchant this is basically the worst case scenario and has tainted my view of accepting it in the future. I have spent at least 10 hours on hold trying to talk to someone, submitted a ticket 48 hours ago and haven’t heard from anyone. 
Coinbase needs to get their shit together or remove merchant features from their offering until they actually work. 
I still need assistance if anyone from Coinbase can please reach out to me!

Any real benefit to using bitfloor over coinbase? I'm trying to purchase some more bitcoins after my first successful one on Monday but I am being told the daily limit has been hit :/
