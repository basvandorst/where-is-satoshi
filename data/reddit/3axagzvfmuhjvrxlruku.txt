Yes, we've talked, I'll touch base with him.

Nothing more concrete yet, this public disclosure is to prevent any trademark or patent claims in the future. I'm certainly months from a working hardware prototype.
What do you think of the gist? Any questions or critique?

Bitcoin is ~380x better than USD, right?

What do you think is missing in the hardware wallet space?

Too dinky, they don't satisfy human's psychological requirements.

Yes, the solar cell and thin-film battery store enough energy to operate in 30 lux, which is very dim lighting, less than a household. I've tallied the different power states and accessory current consumption to find this reasonable. 
The camera is a power hog and will only run when needed. The accelerometer only gives tap interrupts, not constant readings. The display is a Sharp Memory LCD, with very low power requirements and high contrast.
The ARM Cortex M0+ has brown out detection, to be used to finish DMA transfers and shutdown gracefully.
I will not patent this concept, hence my copyleft and public disclosure that I am working on this.

Sure, on the diagram there is "energy storage", a thin-film lithium ion battery in a surface mount package that can hold 50 - 100 uAh.

Well spoken.

Cold Key will be a universal key holder with a signature instruction set that can work with any cryptocurrency. A digital paper wallet, a handheld PGP.
