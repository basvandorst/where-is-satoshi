Could be, but someone guessed (before this auction) that all low bidders got discouraged after the last round, so only serious bidders remain.

This document (R012) is probably about BitPagos, and they used to be exempt from the "money transmitter" laws before (I have forgotten the details). AFAIK, most of BitPagos' hotels are in Argentina, where the hotel owners trust BTC more than the Peso, and want $ to be converted to BTC instead of Peso when a customer pays with credit card. Since the hotel customers - when paying online - are paying with $, I guess US FinCEN think they have some say in what should be legal. Not only if the customer is a US citizen, FinCEN usually thinks that anybody touching the $ must obey US laws.

Not anonymous but pseudonymous. That is an important feature since all transactions are public. If all transactions are public and you know who did the transactions, then the people have no privacy and it would be easy so search out rich people and torture them for money.
@_date: 2014-11-03 12:25:55
Isn't this a dangerous policy change? If bitcoin becomes popular for online transactions, the bitcoin network will easily overflow. 
If more transactions per second (tps) are generated every second than the network can handle (today 7 tps is the max capacity), then eventually the average waiting time per transaction will be weeks. IMO it's better to raise the fee along with the increased tps, so that the bitcoin core developers (and others) have a chance to face this challenge. A valid response would be: issuing a hard fork that increases the block size, or an increased usage of payment channels.
In the meantime, better to have a high fee than not being able to send bitcoin at all, or?

That is a too common misunderstanding. Java code on the SERVER is often much harder to hack than C/C++ code (I assume that the code is open source so that the hacker can study it to find holes). Reasons: 1) since you can't access memory directly in Java the most common attacks (remember Heartbleed?) are not possible. 2) the strict (static + strong) type system will prevent bugs and might prevent hackers from sending dirty data.

Hedging will open the door for more complex business processes, where bitcoin might change hands many times over a longer period of time. Companies that don't care about bitcoin AS A CURRENCY might still use it to transfer value, like a payment system, because it is so much easier to handle than fiat.

Since Bitcoin is controlled by the majority (of hashing power, that is) perhaps you should be afraid. But I guess no form of money, not even gold (the eternal) lives in isolation. It's a way to communicate.

I think it will work just like GLD and SLV, with 100% backing. I await the release day with excitement, because it will open Bitcoin to so many categories who are not even allowed to invest in BTC without it. The first 2 years after the bitcoin ETF has opened will be hysterical IMO. Then, after a few years shorting will be a bigger thing than the shorting we see today at Bitfinex, but I'm fine with that.

Bitcoin price is controlled by psychology, not news. Right now we are - IMO - in the end of a long bear market. The only way for this bear market to end is for the price to fall to a level where buyers clearly outweight sellers, and the trading at that price level should be high (= high volumes at exchanges).
The price has to come down to a level where ppl like me can - without trouble - suck up all the newly mined BTC coming every month from the big miners. If I have to guess, this price is $250 or below. But I'm not waiting for that price myself, I'm buying all the way down, because that is the only safe strategy I can come up with. 
When the old guard can hold the line, then this will be over and speculators will return to bitcoin. First slowly, then in greater number.

Excerpt from the document: 
"Our attack requires only a few machines that establish a certain number of connections by Bitcoin protocol and log the incoming traffic. In a concrete example, an attacker with a few GB of storage and no more than 50 connections to each Bitcoin server can disclose the sender’s IP address in 11% of all transactions generated in the Bitcoin network.
If the attacker tolerates one false positive per identification, the success rate grows to 35%. If he also allows a slight DoS of the network, he may achieve deanonymization rates up to 60% without false positives, which has been confirmed by the experiments in the Bitcoin test network. We estimate the cost of the attack on the full Bitcoin network to be under 1500 EUR per month."

Yes, I know. An increase by a factor of seven could happen almost overnight, since 1 tps is extremely low. Just look at Visa, they have 20 000 tps at peak hours. At peak hours we - at least once - managed to fill an entire block (0.999MB). Scalability is the only thing that I /really/ worry about.

What we DO know is what happened with gold (GLD 2004?) and silver (SLV 2005) when they got their first ETFs. Price went up. How much did the ETFs contribute to the bull run?  Impossible to say, but my guess is: "a lot"
@_date: 2014-12-18 08:05:53
1) about "suck up" BTC: I don't understand you? It's not about if I will lose my money, or what will happen if the price continues to fall. It's all about what price level we "bottom fishers" can scoop up all the BTC for sale.
2) about "all the way down": How can one do safe bottom fishing? Buying all the way down is safe because I don't know when the price will turn around, so if the bottom is $300, I still got to buy for some of my money. If it never goes up, well yes, then I will lose. But in my experience BTC price goes up and down a lot. 
3) about "psychology": "Of course, you also have people aware of the fact that markets are prone to exaggerated movements in both directions" Yes, there are some ppl who will buy stuff they consider cheap. On the stock market they are called value investors, and these investors are buy-&amp;-hold guys, because they are happy with the yield of the asset they buy. True, it is very hard to calculate what a cheap bitcoin should be worth, because BTC doesn't have a yield. On the other hand there IS a bitcoin economy, and that economy will put a lower bound on the total market cap of BTC. Hard to estimate, but one must try.

If 50k BTC comes out on an auction, the market price should be pushed down, because a big buyer could try to buy cheaply from the auction instead of buying from the exchange. This is /usually/ how markets work, but of course there might be exceptions to this rule.

For certificates this is probably true, but ETFs have stricter rules. Just look at what happened 2013 when gold price fell, GLD spewed out tons of gold on the market. It was because people sold GLD, so the ETF had to dump physical metal on the market.
The reverse is also true, when ppl buy GLD the ETF will suck up physical gold on the market.
However, when it comes to gold stored at JPM, they even have an "allocated" and "unallocated" gold. Where the former represents a real gold bar with ID tag, but latter does not have to exist anywhere. Most people buy "unallocated" because it is much cheaper.

I agree with what you say, but I don't think it matters what merchants do with their coins. Crypto is about putting power in the hands of people, and merchants will tag along eventually. 
  When I paid for some domain name today (at namecheap.com) using Bitcoin, I thought to myself: this is so fast &amp; simple, I can't believe how anyone could choose to use credit card. But when it comes to "shopping experience", PayPal is probably just as smooth. So, today the duel is between Bitcoin and PayPal, and I don't think PayPal wants a duel. I think they want to sit down and talk business.

@_date: 2014-12-05 10:24:11
You are correct, the 1MB block size puts a limit of ~7 tps on the Bitcoin network. 
It would be very easy to spam the network, and the only short term protection would be to raise the fee on all "real" transactions. The fee has to go up until the spammer can no longer afford to pay as high fee as the real Bitcoin users. If the spammer has deeper pockets than the real Bitcoin users the spammer will win, i.e. most real transactions will be delayed, roam around the Bitcoin network for some time, and finally be removed due to old age.
Long term there is this hard fork that Gavin talks about, but that might take a while.

@_date: 2014-10-08 08:54:29
But the network does not need to be scalable!  We (at Strawpay) have been working with exactly this for many months now. What is so hard for most people to understand is that every (micro-) transaction inside a payment channel IS a normal bitcoin transaction, it just has not been put out on the network yet. This means that a bitcoin transaction do NOT have to go to the bitcoin network immediatly, or ever, to be considered a real bitcoin transaction. I predict that only a small fraction of bitcoin transactions will reach the bitcoin network in the future. This is the key to bitcoin scalability. 
But there is still some work to be done. On top of payment channels we have developed a consumer-to-hub-to-merchant protocol, something previously called Strom (but since that is the name of some asshole politician we will change it to Stroem). We think just having payment channels is not enough. Wallets need to communicate with hubs over richer protocol. Stroem will be a BIP proposal in time.

I don't know all the details, but I was one of the people in the Swedish chat from which Iman was recently kicked out (I don't have any connection to Btcx, I work at Strawpay.com). I want to motivate our decision. He was only a member for a few weeks, but we saw early that he liked to quarrel and accuse people of having a bad attitude etc. He was warned by me once before, so when this shitstorm hit our chat my view was that Iman once more abused our rules, by picking a fight with a competitor, and at the same time promoted his new company ("will open my own trading site that will make Btcx look like a toy").  He also insulted a bystander sexually, so he was finally banned. The first and only person we have ever banned. 
  What I _can_ tell you is that some of the claims in the article are incorrect. I know this because Iman told us that he was "smart enough to make a SQL copy of the entire DB before I quit", and one member notified Iman that he himself broke the law, so I guess the story had to change a bit.
  I am NOT saying that ppl at Btcx are innocent, because I don't know anything about that.

You are correct about Russians fleeing to $ and EURO, because that's what usually happens when people get scared: they flee to things they know well. Bitcoin is as far from being a "fall back currency" for the common man.
However, I have not seen any connection between Bitcoin price movements and political events, like the current loss of confidence in the Rouble. Bitcoin does not correlate to the gold/silver price, which is sensitive to economic news. Bitcoin does its own thing, more or less blind to the world.

You don't have to use Oracle's Java. A Linux server will install OpenJDK for you, and that shit is as safe as Linux itself. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 20:15:31


This will only work if bitcoin does not become very popular very quickly. Just like Gavin suggested, a small increase over time is much safer.


Correct. A hard fork can mess up a lot of things, and we are not ready for it yet. Also there are other concerns, see:  
@_date: 2014-11-21 06:12:47
I am a Swede too, but I think this anger is somewhat misplaced. Remember that KnC was one of the few who DIDN'T scam customers, and many ppl made heaps of money using their equipment. I know that KnC has not been keeping their promises of late, but I think their move towards cloud mining is actually a response to the problem with broken rigs. They probably think that it is way easier to replace a broken rig themselves in a mining center instead of spending time emailing back and forth with the customer. They will sell mining power to customers, but if customers don't show up they will use the rigs themselves. 
HOWEVER, I don't think cloud mining is good for Bitcoin, since too much power is centralized. Also, the cloud mining company will get into a conflict of interest with the customer, because when the price of BTC is high the cloud miner will profit more from not renting out the rigs, so this is also problematic.

He he. Well, if all you have is our web page to look at I would not expect anybody to trust us.
@_date: 2015-01-02 20:28:49
Lower fees. Faster confirmations. These things are not very important now, but there are many investors (myself included) who are sceptical towards Bitcoin's ability to scale. With a scalable solution at hand we can sleep better at night.
CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY? Not yet, but see:

What happened to PRICE DOWN PICK UP?
@_date: 2015-01-02 23:48:35
Well yes.
1) the Micro payment from consumer to hub on the channel is immediate and secure. No way to double spend.
2) The consumer gets the Promissory Note (basically an IOU signed by the Hub) from the Stroem hub that (s)he signs and sends to the merchant. 
3) The merchant validates the signatures in the Note, and can hold the Note until (s)he decides it's time to get paid. 
4) When the merchant sends the Note(s) (could be a Batch to increase performance) to the Hub, the Hub will validate the signatures on the Note(s) and pay. 
Note: It is impossible to double spend the Note too (explanation is a bit complicated, but just trust me). It is - however - possible for the Hub not to pay the merchant, but this would be stupid, since the Note has his signature, and the amount *should* be too small to steal.
All in all: no double spends and very fast. Real bitcoin transaction, except for the short span of trust between merchant and hub.
@_date: 2015-01-02 15:36:22
We are not "public" yet but since the discussion is on I could  just as well explain what we are doing.
We are building a new (open source) protocol called Stroem for micropayments. The participants are typically a) consumer b) merchant c) hub, where the aim is for the consumer to pay for something by sending a payment over a payment channel to the hub. The merchant will then get notified of this payment (via a Promissory Note) and can collect the payment in any manner (aggregated or one at a time), by handing in the Promissory Note.
* Stroem builds on top of the payment channel implementation found in bitcoinj. 
* Stroem describes how wallets should interact with payment channels to be able to send payments to "Stroem hubs". The first wallet that will be Stroem enabled is MultiBitHD.
* Anybody can start a Stroem hub. There will be a simple OSS impl for ppl to use. The Stroem hub might charge a fee for relaying transactions.
* Stroem also builds on top of the payment protocol spec (BIP 0070). BIP 0070 is used primarily between the consumer's wallet and the merchant.
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:30:29
Thanks man! Will look at it. We might use it as a template for a Java impl. 2 dollar @_date: 2015-01-02 22:46:06

True, but there is still a slim chance of finding the hacker this way.

Our web page is not really "live". Sorry.
@_date: 2015-01-02 18:07:50
Agreed. But what unit the consumer sees is up to the wallet developer.
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:19:33
We have followed the CLTV developmemt, and we would especially like to get rid of the risk of malleability attacks. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 18:05:01
Do you understand payment channels? Most bitcoiners don't. It is payment channels that crunches many transactions into one, so they can all share one fee. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 15:56:39
I know, I know  :) See this thread instead: 
@_date: 2015-01-06 15:32:46
Someone should talk to Kraken about these things. They are pretty sharp IMO.
@_date: 2015-01-02 15:23:53
No. But in time the payment channel implementation could be made much simpler using OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY.
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:22:33
We have a lib written in Java that wallets should use, but it's under development. There is no support for iOS wallets yet (they don't even have a payment channel impl AFAIK).
Even with the lib at hand there is a lot of GUI work and general plumbing for a wallet developer before the wallet is Stroem enabled. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 09:04:47
This is what  wrote on Twitter: "If you track the bigger amount of coins (through the chain) you'll see that the bigger sum is constantly drained over time. This is inconsistent with cold storage behavior. It seems that the cold storage was drained over a period of time. Therefore, I believe that  does not have any reserves. The last 19k was just ordinary people cashing out their coins (who knew)."
Anyone who can confirm this?
@_date: 2015-01-03 20:49:55
Same here :)
@_date: 2015-01-08 16:16:18


Trend is not your friend. Don't follow the herd. After all, how many of you guys came into crypto because you wanted to do what everyone else was doing?
@_date: 2015-01-08 09:34:22
Yes, that part is not consistent with what we know about the "hack" (if it is a hack).
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:02:03
The straw is a metaphor for the payment channel. Small continous payments flowing through the pipe.
@_date: 2015-01-27 09:37:30
I'll be there, guaranteed! (unless we have another price drop :-)
@_date: 2015-01-02 20:46:58
There are many things here you have thought through, and we are on the same page on most of it.
Symmety: For hubs it is easy to have channels in both directions, and there is probably often trust. But we think that it is not practical for the consumer to set up a payment channel server. It is better/easier for the consumer to always be client, in part due to what you said (hard to close the channel). 
We have thought a lot about how to send money back to the consumer. We have ideas, but nothing decided yet.
Hub Theft: Hubs can steal any micropayment, but not more than that. 
Promissory Note: A digital, rather advanced version, of this 
@_date: 2015-01-03 00:07:53
The only way to double spend when it comes to payment channels, is when you set up the channel and when you tear it down in the end. For the Micro transactions on the channel: not possible.
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:07:06
No. It is up to each Stroem hub to charge a fee. Since the market will set the price, hopefully it will be low. You are free to set up a hub with 0% fee if you like.
@_date: 2015-01-03 06:37:46
Yes. I was waiting for this question. This was probably the longest discussion we had. The reasons:
1) Security: it is a complex thing to keep a payment channel server running. It has to be secure. Most merchants do not have the knowledge, and could get their wallet hacked. The Promissory Note, the way we designed it, cannot be used by anyone else than the merchant, so it is pointless to steal it.
2) Performance: we worry that in a network of hubs the progression of micropayments from hub to hub would not be fast enough. Better to tell the merchant that the consumer has paid ASAP, and let the merchant hold the Promissory Note instead.
Very hard choice.
@_date: 2014-11-13 15:28:42
It is good for us that there is one big bank that tolerates bitcoin in Sweden, but what happens if they too have a change of heart? This is the rational thing for them to do, because IMO bitcoin /is/ the "bank killer" (ok, maybe not killer, but at least a destroyer of the money transmitter monopoly, currently held by banks).
@_date: 2015-01-02 20:22:25
Yes, no chance of double spend for transactions INSIDE the channel.
@_date: 2015-01-02 22:42:12
He he, that would be too hard to google so we changed the spelling.
@_date: 2014-10-30 16:42:16


You must see that Halfhand84 was being sarcastic?
I got in early 2011. I've been trading BTC's ups and downs with some success, but I was all too happy way too early and early this year I had sold more than 99% of my initial position. 
Now I look with envy to the buy and hold "fools". 70% down from peak? That's nothing! I have been buying back in for months. I know more now. I trust Bitcoin more now.
@_date: 2015-04-29 11:58:36
WTF 1 dollar
@_date: 2015-04-29 08:06:43
After speaking to Nanok about this a minute ago, it seems like this ETN (Exchange-Traded Note) will be fully backed, i.e. every investment will generate a corresponding purchase of BTC on some exchange. 
This *should* push the price up, since hedge funds are finally able to invest in BTC. Yay!!
EDIT: KnC is backing XBT Provider, and the ~~fee seems to be 0.16% as of now. Inexpensive, right?~~
EDIT2: 0.16% is probably the exchange's fee. XBT Provider fee is 2.5%.
@_date: 2015-04-30 10:03:59
I don't understand what you say? You can't claim the commodity if you invest in an ETF, all you can do is sell it. 
But what I do know is that when investors started selling GLD huge volumes of physical gold hit the markets and pushed the price down, the same way GLD pushed the price of gold up in the beginning. So it probably won't be all roses forever.
@_date: 2015-04-29 16:14:11
@_date: 2015-04-29 09:47:12
Hmm, then 0.16% is the exchange's fee. Real fee might be 2.5 + 0.16 = 2.66% 
@_date: 2015-04-29 16:20:31
I was told they kept it secret to comply with regulations.
@_date: 2015-04-29 16:16:07
OT but we're working overtime to "finish some stuff", the way programmers do :-)
@_date: 2015-04-30 06:52:04
I'm not sure I get your point. Financial instruments sold on public exchanges like Nasdaq are *heavily* regulated. Bitcoin exchanges are usually not regulated much?
@_date: 2015-04-29 16:18:22
GLD and SLV gave gold and silver a real boost the first years.
@_date: 2015-04-30 06:55:12
My worry is the opposite: that unscrupulous hedge funds would buy this instrument and then pump BTC until they dump it on the common man. That would increase the volatility of BTC.
@_date: 2015-04-29 09:50:04
Good question!  1 $ @_date: 2015-04-29 12:04:43
What we need is a way for hedge funds to be able to invest. If they can invest, some will, and this should move the price up during the first years. Private persons OTOH should own real bitcoin IMO.
@_date: 2015-03-03 05:49:57
Chris is good at TA, and has a solid track record. However, I feel that the medium to long term is missing. IMO one should think about that Bitcoin has been in a bear market for 1+ year, and stack up based on that fact. In other words: Time to HODL

@_date: 2015-02-10 04:35:42
We keep Stroem's source closed for now (because it isn't stable). A white paper draft will be released in a few months, and we would be happy to receive feedback on it.
@_date: 2015-02-20 08:31:40
So they say. But do you remember the day when Bitstamp got hacked? That day BitPay used Bitstamp's last rate for the entire shutdown, so you could actually make money paying with BTC on any BitPay shop, since the rate on all other exchanges went down during the shutdown.
TL;DR I doesn't work.
@_date: 2015-02-10 04:23:58
The Stroem - MultiBitHD integration is not finished. The MultiBitHD team have put a lot of effort into the Trezor integration, and I think a public release (1.0?) is just days away. The Stroem integration should appear in the next release (1.1?). 
  The reason why you can't see Stroem is that you have to enable Stroem under Labs, but still, not much to see at this stage. Without a Stroem hub to connect to you won't be able to create a Stroem channel anyway. 
@_date: 2015-02-28 15:42:57
Correct. But between servers this will work. And end users can connect a payment channel to one of the servers when they are online.
@_date: 2015-02-10 11:01:17
The hubs also use Stroem to communicate, which is (will be) open source. A hub will not relay payments from a hub it does not trust, but if it chooses relay payment for a specific hub it will typically charge a fee for every payment. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 08:43:33
That document is 6 months old. Is it really still valid?
