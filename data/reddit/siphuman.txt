The best for any currency is not to swap them at all. This is the most cost efficient.

Guess what will happen to the Euro after the Greeks vote no in the referendum. Might be wise to move some Euro to USD if you don't want to go BTC.

Lol. At the moment is just a proof of concept. Maybe we can do this in phase 2.

I dont think Bitcoin will prevent this. It might actually make it easier. There are 3 steps in money laundering :
1. **Hiding the source** of funds: Bitcoin may help with this as everything is on a transparent ledger
2. **Moving and tumbling** money around. To hide the source. Buying expensive jewelry and giving as gifts. to stay outside the banking system. Bitcoin might actually make this easier. No need for the jewelry.
3. **Reintroducing** money:  Making the bad money appear as proper money. Again Bitcoin might make this easier especially with peer to peer exchanges such as local bitcoins.
