Do you have a source for this? I want this to be true but am quite skeptical...

I’ll save you the suspense and let you know he will not be able to show you any proof of this fake transaction. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:10:27
He didn’t. He’s looking for attention. You don’t hear from people that actually have made that much because they know to keep their mouth shut. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:03:08
Yes it does.

$1m per coin is 1 cent per satoshi.

Update your phone!

Oh, don’t get me wrong I understand it is an infinitesimally small chance. Mostly just a shower thought. :) Thanks for the reply.

Are.... you from the future?  What is the price of a bitcoin in 2025?
Obligatory /s...

You can’t.  You can transfer it to GDAX and transfer to your wallet from there and you won’t pay any fees. Can’t do this from the app though.

It is illegal to not accept cash for a debt.  Refusing to sell for cash is not, as far as I know.  
Slight distinction.

GDAX is the exchange owned by Coinbase. You would just go to GDAX.com and login with the same credentials as with coinbase. There may be a bit more identification needed, but it is worth it to avoid the fees. From there you would just deposit on there and use your coinbase account as the source. Then you can withdraw using your wallet address.

A related question. Would it be possible to randomly choose an address already being used and therefore get control of the bitcoins in someone else’s wallet?  Obviously it is an incredibly unlikely thing, but it would be a non-zero chance if it works that way. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:25:49
Haha, no doubt.  I just hope I have enough time to get a more sizable stake by then :)
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:38:23
Hell, I'm over here HOPING that happens so I can buy more. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:54:15
Awesome.  Seems simple enough.  Thanks!

Ok, actually one (ok multiple) more question(s). I have withdrawn from GDAX now, but there was never an option for setting fees or anything like that?  How long until my funds will be at the address on my wallet and if it doesn't get confirmed, when will I see the funds back on my GDAX account?

I bought my first .02 when it hit $5200 (I had finally made the decision to start investing when it was at $4800 but wanted to wait for my hardware wallet to arrive) I felt like I overpaid then but now I feel like it was cheap.  This is so exciting!

It said 11 million users total. A bit confusing to be sure. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:21:49
Can you explain more on how to do this?  I too would like to move some BTC off coinbase into my hardware wallet but don't want to pay such high fees.

The last 24 hours has been quite a ride, but my head spins thinking what will happen after an official announcement that one of these tech giants is all aboard.
