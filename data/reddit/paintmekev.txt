You can write off up to 3,000 losses per year until you hit your 32k so basically you have a little over 10 years of writing this off.

I used to use BTC-E, But I recently moved everything over to Bitfinex. I used a refferal code for a discount in trading fees. check out for a lot more info on trading.

Exactly. I emailed back and forth with Josh about the insolvency, he def did not expect it Me: "Let's hope they're not insolvent!" Josh: ":) I think it's unlikely!"  Unfortunatley I traded mine at ~.40 thinking that was a deal. If people that traded at .04 get goxcoin back, fml.

Half of us have been up for a bit. My buy orders down to 650 did nicely :)

Oops mobile device didn't say you were op. Replying out of thread. Let me ask someone I know that's an attorney at the IRS where this sits.

No one in Quebec has an actual French accent. It's some freaky Canadian French. Maybe he was on meds?

He bought and lost bitcoin so I would file it as a standard loss with crypto. Is the site he was gambling on a registered US gambling house?

*Accepted. if you fix the title more people will probably click your post

He's French...

Bought it. 99cents to help bitcoin is worth it.

Most of what you said is false. The IRS would not be at your door until you fail to report the money on your taxes. Also 2k sets flags?? That's hilarious. I deposit 2k transactions 5 times a month and pay my taxes on it and no one shows up at my door.

iOS doesn't use apk. I still have the app on my phone and bought tons of things online using it. Works great!

The coinbase App is basically a webapp in a container. It doesn't need any apple connection to continue working. I'm glad I downloaded it as well, works great!

Thank you! I live nearby and have been looking with no results! I'm going to hunt these guys down.

the front page is the featured stores. you will have to click on the categories to see everything. There are quite a few.

That's why you would walk into your bank and notify them what you are planning on doing. These would probably be taxed as Capitol gains. So as long as you pay those taxes, the money is yours.

If you don't have he cancel option then you have a locked in price for when you hit the submit button. That alert info comes and goes as there inventory of BTC fluctuates.

I've bought many things through bitpay with coinbase. no issues at all.
