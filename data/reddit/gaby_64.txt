I had it wrong but money is still being created out of thin air by banks
With bitcoin keeping a 10% reserve would not really do anything as the ammounts would have to add up to the original ammount
Ah but the total debt would be 9 times the original amount, im having a hard time seeing the debtors money, he could theoretically take out all his money at once after it was lent out again so that the money lent out was created out of thin air
@_date: 2016-08-30 11:16:02
Ya that's it. So the banks would end up with 9 times the original amount after all the debts are repaid? This is continually happening giving the illusion that money is being created out of thin air, seems like a ponzi scheme, it counts on the fact that there will always be more and more debt to be generated. That there is never a point of total resolve of all debts. But I believe that time will come as cryptocurrencies absorbs all wealth with its hyper liquidity.

you cannot create bitcoins out of thin air other then mining

there is a limit to the how small transistors can get and the amount of hashing efficiency you can get out of of them.
an ASIC arms race would force ASIC company's to use the most up to date technology and develop more efficient transistor routing and software. ASIC's would then be limited to foundry developments on reducing transistor size. aka they would be at a wall.
its in the interest of all ASIC manufacturers to limit their own developments to increase business cycles. not that they are intentionally getting together to do so, its naturally what is done since it is risky to invest more in more complex routing and software, especially on a time delivery standpoint.

no im saying that fundamentally it has a root in evolutionary biology that makes it harder to overcome then just a cultural problem. there was a time before culture and time for thought, women then served mostly only natures purpose, biologically we have not changed much since then. 
establishing a proper culture will require careful consideration, bio-social pressures are quite complicated, they are not always evident or easily link-able to a specific causation.
environment defines who we are, so i disagree with f/m isms  
maybe in a more open and egalitarian society the lines will be blured to the point the only difference between f/m is physical and that without its handicap to environment exposure.
but its certainly not going to be fixed by bitcoin.

believe what, im talking about compound beliefs making up value perception
my individual belief wont set price, its collective interaction that sets price.
inherent value is use value, want/need precedes use value, want/need comes from beliefs
how much you want/need something will determine how much you will pay and how fast from initially having that want/need
there is no such thing as common deterministic inherent value, the inherent value is subjective
you subtract human want/need and you have 0 inherent/intrinsic value

no my calculations include 30 second block upload/download to 8 peers and the double relaying of txs
going from the 2Mbps currently required to 1000Mbps does give us the ability to make 375MB blocks

1Gbps upload  
there are more  
@_date: 2016-09-13 03:17:31
we must ensure the confidence and trust in bitcoin
that means solving the blocksize issue for good
how will it increase the cost of bitcoin use?  
the majority of pools and miners are already on Gigabit speed lines
now we just need the majority of nodes to transition to Gigabit speed lines aswell
  
@_date: 2016-09-19 07:36:06
the purpose of a transaction should not matter, the point is we should be able to do transaction across the spectrum of value  
this is possible if we allow bitcoin to scale, miners will get more from many fees and fee cost will drop
@_date: 2016-09-18 09:12:45
im looking for people with access to 100-1000Mbps  
there should be millions around the world that have access to such speeds and i am not talking about datacenters
according to a study, 10% of current nodes would have the bandwidth for 200MB blocks  
I have calculated that 1Gbps would allow for 375MB blocks, 2422tps and 225 bitcoins in fees for the miners
@_date: 2016-09-15 04:49:07
most miners and pools already have access to gigabit internet  
its also already widely available enough to guarantee that thousands of nodes can run Gigabit internet in many cities around the world  
with more developments coming online in the next few years (India being a big one with Reliance Jio, China also developing their fiber networks)  
Gigabit speeds allow for 375MB/block, 2422 transaction per second, 209.26 million transaction per day and 225 bitcoins of fees per block  
we can uncap bitcoin and allow it to scale to millions of users able to do atleast do 1 transaction per day

1MB block was an arbitrary decision and it sidelined me  
we have to learn to let go, let bitcoin fly to its potential  
your forgetting that it will take time for the network to meet gigabit capacity, its not gona be overnight, so the network will adapt  
as Gigabit capacity gets built, its going to be less and less of a problem overtime  
but im also saying that the Gigabit connection points are plentiful enough to support thousands of nodes with 1000Mbps today around the world
@_date: 2016-09-21 07:37:12
it does change the time it takes for blocks to propagate around the world, blocks are not pings, its sequential data
1Gbps is widely available, we can have all the decentralization we want and big blocks

im not trying to get rich, im trying to secure my investment  
if bitcoin does not solve its scaling issue, another will take its place, that would mean i would lose in my investment  
by the time the network naturally grows, and this can happen quickly, fiber will be dominant in all country's  
at billions of users, we will have no choice but to support 0.375-3.75GB blocks, this does not need to be bad, it can be good if we make the right changes, such as figuring out a way to incentivize gigabit nodes  
if we begin today, we can provide greater pressure on telcos to deliver more fiber broadband  
most people ask, whats the point of Gigabit speeds, i would like to be able to say Bitcoin  
all country's have access to Gigabit speeds, in actuality  
so no i am not deciding entire countries should have no access to running a full node (entirely different from saying access to bitcoin)  
keep trying to attack me  
more information supporting my position that you do not like 
WE CAN HAVE BIG BLOCKS AND DECENTRALIZATION, gigabit connection points are widespread enough for geographic and ownership distribution, which is what decentralization is. Do you have an alternative definition of decentralization?
@_date: 2016-09-12 23:57:01
Gigabit internet speeds are upon us, there is already enough distribution of such capacity to insure decentralization
I say remove the blocksize limit
Im willing to donate to a fund that would spinup nodes in datacenters if that is what is required to maintain decentralization

we could have just as many people validating the chain with gigabit connection points, it will take some more promotion but it is doable  
am i gona have to have a lighting channel open with all the business I interact with every day? online and brick and mortar  
you have to think about billions doing daily transactions, lightning cannot provide in those individual cases  
again im not asking for an immediate jump in real blocksize, just a jump in limit, there was a study suggesting 90% of current nodes could support 4MB  
official definition of decentralization: Decentralization is the process of redistributing or dispersing functions, powers, people or things away from a central location or authority  
nothing to do with validating the chain, im not saying that is not important, it is
bitcoin will grow, there is no doubt about that, the question is, will we be smart enough to not block that growth by trying to hold on to the idea that everyone should be able to verify the chain, including people on dialup
im currently setting up my own gigabit node, if everyone was on gigabit speeds i would not have to wait for days for the blockchain to download
@_date: 2016-09-14 07:47:30
But it is available enough to maintain a decentralized distribution, we just gotta get people in those areas aware of bitcoin and interested enough to run a node. If only we could reward bandwith contributors.

@_date: 2016-09-13 00:42:03
its specifically supply and demand, but it could be said that confidence in the future of bitcoin is what drive sustained demand
now in regards to transaction per day, the op forgets to calculate block relaying, which is the limiting factor
with Gigabit speeds, 468.75MB/block or 3028 transaction per second or 261.6 million transaction per day, 281.25 bitcoin fees per block is possible
gigabit speeds are available enough now and distributed enough to guarantee bitcoin decentralization, within 2-4 years it will be the world standard.
i say we should remove the blocksize limit  
i would be willing to donate to a fund to get bitcoin nodes started up on VPS's around the world
@_date: 2016-09-13 04:21:18
you still have not explained the additional cost, you are assuming it will require more investments to support larger blocks or that unused capacity costs more
the truth is the capacity in the world already exists and at competitive rates, infact google fiber's 1Gbps is cheaper then my 8Mbps/1Mbps
@_date: 2016-09-13 20:11:59
multiply that blocksize by 10, you need to relay txs twice and you need to relay blocks to 8 peers or more
@_date: 2016-09-17 05:37:48
According to the recently released position paper, On Scaling Decentralized Blockchains, 4,000 Bitcoin nodes were tested and per-node bandwidth performance was measured. The study found that 90%, of the then, 4565 bitcoin nodes, can continue to operate at 4MB blocks
What i am saying is not unreasonable, Gigabit bandwidth is available to more then just datacenters, in the USA alone it is available to over 3 million,   
this is not up to date, but you can see that it is widely available around the world.
we can uncap bitcoin, its not like we will see an immediate jump to &gt;4mb blocks within the year, as time passes by more and more locations will have access to Gigabit speeds, including India and China
@_date: 2016-09-15 01:50:13
thats just google fiber, there are other providers offering 1000Mbps
also if we where to put the max blocksize at 300MB, we would not see blocks that size until a few years down the road, unless someone wants to try and waste 180 bitcoins dosing the network for 10 minutes, that would only increase the orphan rate
Gigabit speeds will be the standard within the next few years, the internet backbone can support it, if little towns in Canada can get it, so can the rest of the densely populated world

thats why you use multiple different providers

i am the tweeter who suggests 370mb blocks, what is wrong with utilizing what is available now (millions of people with gigabit internet access) to eliminate the debate and liberate bitcoin to scale
if you want to secure bitcoins value, you want confidence and trust in its network ability, that includes decentralization and the ability to scale to what will inevitably be millions of users
@_date: 2016-09-19 23:09:00
does every nation have to be able to run a node for bitcoin to work, no  
how would western nations takeover the thousands of nodes its individuals operate to do an attack as you suggest against other nations
also not all nodes are equal, nodes operated by exchanges have more say in what rules the miners obey, these are likely to be Gigabit nodes already  
we CAN have both large blocks and high decentralization  
also what im suggesting would not immediately cut off any region, we are not going to jump in blocksize that quickly, it will grow naturally
@_date: 2016-09-19 08:02:46
the majority of economic activity currently occurs at exchanges, they can run full nodes at gigabit speeds and they most probably do  
you must be thinking of convoluted costs to suppose you would need 80% fees to support a network of gigabit nodes, that is not the case at all.  
the connections points for gigabit internet already exist in great enough numbers around the world and its only getting better.  looking at the costs, 1Gbps is actually cheaper in many cases (70-100$/month)  
do you want bitcoin to succeed or not?  
we will lose out to altcoins such as DASH with its instant transactions with masternodes if we cannot fix bitcoins scaling issues  
the moment the majority realizes that bitcoin will not be mainstream ready, confidence will be lost and with the lack of friction, value will migrate to the best solution rather quickly  
mainstream is billions of users, even with 375MB blocks we will have a hard time scaling to billions, by that time I will be advocating 10Gbps nodes
@_date: 2016-09-17 02:22:20
how is it centralization? its both ownership and geography dispersed    
how many times do I have to repeat that millions of regular consumers have access to Gigabit internet  
bigger blocks will not increase centralization if we promote people with access to Gigabit speeds to run nodes  
also its not like we will jump to 370mb blocks within a year of changing the blocksize limit  
based on the data i have collected up to now, most people can support 2mb blocks right now

most miners and pools already have access to gigabit internet  
its also already widely available enough to guarantee that thousands of nodes can run Gigabit internet in many cities around the world  (India being a big one with Reliance Jio, China also developing their fiber networks)  
with more developments coming online in the next few years
Gigabit speeds allow for 375MB/block, 2422 transaction per second, 209.26 million transaction per day and 225 bitcoins of fees per block  
we can uncap bitcoin without undermining its decentralization or exposing it to state risks

how does percentage of economic activity relate to nodes and their block capacity?

ofcourse i can, but you people dont get it, im not here to get rich quick, im here to secure my value, confidence is everything for a currency, i would also like to avoid the situation that is likely to happen if bitcoin does not fix its value proposition, part of that proposition is mainstream capability, billions transacting everyday. Why are you so hard pressed on keeping blocks small? why does it matter what percentage of the population can run a node? what should we define as a healthy network?
@_date: 2016-09-18 23:37:32
1st step is to understand what public/private keys are and allow you to do  
2nd step is to understand what a hash function is  
3rd step is to understand how bitcoin uses these concepts to secure a distributed ledger and create what is called a blockchain

you are imposing your ideas of what should or should not be on the blockchain, sidechains and lightning do not solve the issue of individuals wanting to do a few transactions per day, lightning is for stuff like satoshidice where you have many transactions between the same parties  
We have no choice but to support larger blocks if we want to scale, finito, end of discussion. Now we have to figure out how we get there.  
That is not decentralization, thats just validating the chain for yourself.  
You dont want to look at the data that supports the reality that fiber is growing fast and already is widely prevalent  
@_date: 2016-09-17 21:41:55
by the time the block reward drops to near 0, if we increase the blocksize limit to 375MB, fees will be 225BTC, thats if bitcoin stays the same value for 16 years, by that time we can expect even bigger blocks, probably 1GB or more, as most people will have 10Gbps internet
@_date: 2016-09-14 04:36:20

platter disk drive might not be on an exponential trend, but SSD's are  
samsung already has 16TB SSD, ofcourse at the moment they are selling them only to enterprise customers at regular SSD $/GB  
but that will change very quickly within the next 2 years  
technology's such as 3D Xpoint, PCM and Crossbar RRAM will make reliable and high density storage low cost  
Gigabit network speeds will be the world standard within 4 years  
keeping the blocksize limit at 1MB is stupid
it costs 0.6BTC of fees to fill a 1MB block  
it would cost 60BTC of fees to fill a 100MB block  
remove the blocksize and let people try to dos, miners will be happy
@_date: 2016-09-11 03:11:39
its only logical that miners wont risk adopting a bitcoin clone, no one wants to be the first mover with such high risk, if core devs put out a release, there are better odds that it will be adopted, especially if it does not immediately cause a fork, an exchange is more likely to adopt core changes since its just an update to their wallet and not a completely different wallet with another name
what small miners?
what we have is pools and big miners who can run on their own  
miners cannot be fired, the worst that could happen for them is the price of btc crashing, its in their interest to make sure bitcoin can scale to several 100 millions of people doing daily transactions before we reach the limit and risk losing the confidence of people in the system  
Gigabit speed internet is prevalent enough and distributed enough to guarantee bitcoins decentralization  
It will also be coming to most within the near future, 2-4years  
its obvious that miners are not the primary sellers of bitcoins, they seem to be aware of bitcoins growth potential and its deflationary nature, you are risking allot of money selling now vs in the future  
the majority of miners have a long term view  
we went from 3600 bitcoins being created a day to 1800, electricity costs is 33% of the revenue with the highest efficiency hardware, that means 594BTC should be hitting the exchanges every day, sure only a 2.6% drop in comparison to the 22400 bitcoins in exchange volume, but really how much btc is being actually deposited on these exchanges daily vs the buying and selling by traders
i dont have a sound solution, my idea is to completely forgo the blocksize limit, i say let people try to dos bitcoin, the worst it will do is kick off all the bitcoin nodes that cant support the speeds required for a blocksize, it will be prohibitively expensive for them to maintain it
its the exchanges that really set what the bitcoin protocol should be  
they have access to multi gigabit speeds  
they have no reason not to support an official core fix
@_date: 2016-09-15 22:37:44
there is enough availability of gigabit speeds to consumers and data-centers to guarantee thousands of nodes can support such blocks, but im certainly not saying we will have 300mb blocks overnight, this will happen over the next 5 years and gigabit speeds will be the standard by then, either via 5G or FTTH
also most pools already have access to Gigabit speeds
@_date: 2016-09-10 22:47:13
THE bitcoin can only be fixed by people with influence
even if you have a sound proposal, its not enough if it does not incentivize exchanges and miners to switch, the risk of a fork itself adds a disincentive for any proposal, the miners should be happy with bigger blocks, they could make more bitcoins from the fees then the block reward, aslong as they have good internet speeds
Gigabit speeds will be the world standard by 2020

Still not over it, probably never going to be over it with the increasing price. 1000$ could have turned into 500000$ by now, but the reality is i would have probably sold it anyway at some point when needing money if i had not gambled it.

2877924400 * 5500 = 15 828 584 000 000USD market capitalization  
15828584000000USD/21000000BTC = 753742USD/BTC

total world asset value be 1 quadrillion dollars  
bitcoin cap is 21 million
so since maybe 10% of total world assets would be in play
the formula would be:  
(1,000,000,000,000,000 * 0.1) / 21,000,000 = 4,761,904

as long as its userbase grows, yes  
altho its userbase will not directly correlate to the value  
the potential buyers will always be interacting with a smaller and smaller float of bitcoins available for purchse, so as long as the volume in demand remains growing the exponential rise will be possible.
We use to think 1$ to 4$ increase was a allot, now we are looking at variation in the 10$ to 40$ with the same mood. a few months from now we will be accustomed to 100$ to 400$ variations and therefore the larger numbers wont be as ridiculous.

OP had posted:
The solution is to buy up allot of servers around the world and run a distributed hidden site with a centralized entry point, ownership unfortunately cannot be distributed, it is essential to its function that each node can be trusted.
My trusted programmers claim that they can do this, it would be a super efficient system. A slim client webapp with distributed websockets, serving all needed data, less waste then HTTP request/response they say. The backend is coded in c, uses libwebsockets, NuoDB and Quancast File System for maximum distributed resilience, speed and efficiency.
We intend to finish the backend, build the frontend and buy hosted servers from around the world once enough interest has accumulated.

altho linux is awsome, it takes patience and the will to follow through in constantly finding solutions the all the problems that arise from its fragmentation. depending on what distro you are running and on what hardware, you may have experienced the unstability and hours of frustration trying to get things to work the way you want it to.
alas bitcoin is no linux, its one implementation of a protocol that was thought out at a certain point in time, heralded as well written to increase your confidence. In terms of disk space, ram and bandwith, bitcoin is highly inefficient. We can find better ways to implement a highly parallel distributed crypto-currency that would satisfy all 3 criteria. We can do this, but it is not bitcoin or atleast wont include your current transactions.

please go read bitcoin.org  
your way wrong on your explanation
you computer bruteforces sha256  
bitcoins are not solutions, infact bitcoins do not exist  
the solution is a number that made a hash with enough leading 0's  
the hash is the block hash + a number hashed  
the reward is a transaction your miner put in the block you solved
the blockchain is a history of transactions and thus balances and thus bitcoins dont exist.

Unfortunately this is almost impossible to accomplish with a goal of real-time trading, we are limited by the speed of propagation through the distributed network.  
is my idea:  
  
trade client (updates the client on the orderbook, latest trades, high, low, charts and offers funding (connected to server 2) and trading(distributed) options)  
public distributed orderbook (like the blockchain, every client will need to mine, secure with low difficulty since the only reward is a functional distributed trading platform)  
central trade listener and executioner (server 1 - non-public)  
(interacts with orderbookchain and server 2)  
needs to broadcast the wait-for block number (your client requires his orderbookchain to be updated to this block to add trades)  
probably through an attached public server  
central banking interaction and escrow system (server 2)  
  
The orderbookchain contains all the orders unfulfilled, fulfilled or partially fulfilled for its entire history. The non-public server listens for the longest chain and evaluates the orderbook to set new statuses on trades, then creates a new valid block with it.  
  
The end goal would be something that executes trades every 5 minutes or lower if possible. Delays in the system are:  
-Trade propagation  
-Mining a orderbook block  
-Central Trade Server picking it up  
-Central Trade Server doing its logic  
-Central Trade Server making a new block (some way to make it instant for its special case?)  
-Clients getting the block and updating the displayed information

I have only recently re-ventured into C, i know the ease and efficiency of programming in Javascript and PHP. I place great importance on the structure of a program, and that will be guided by the languages abstractions, altho you can write efficient code with higher level language, thats not the way most programmers will code given the mindset built around such language. C forces you to think more like the machine and deliver what you want knowing exactly what happens at every level allowing you to come up with innovative solutions vs a higher level programmer. I love Javascript, but C will always have its place.

make it distributed, with a public buy/sell order list with associated bitcoin addresses and third party money escrow system account id.
could be simple to make, secure and transparent. Possibly more modular in terms of banking options with the third party escrow and banking system. Hybrid of centralization and decentralization.
Could even make use of other exchanges when such a thing is more convenient, but that would require a partnership with them. Imagine all the exchanges joined so money and bitcoins move around with much more ease. I could load up money to my local exchange and use that in other exchanges that dont offer the same banking conveniences but that has higher volume or more currency diversity.
