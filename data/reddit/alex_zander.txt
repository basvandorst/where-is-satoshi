You can’t have a legitimate business by lying. There are many banks that will take his money.

At this time it’s more profitable to take the money that you would use on electricity and just purchase coins with it. 
There are many miner machines on the market. Look them up on eBay or amazon. Then look up a profit calculator to see how much you would earn with the mining speed vs electric bill. 
Edit: you can buy an antminer s9 for $1500 and earn $40/month. Break even in 3 years.

If you’re not mining on your own, then you are just investing in a mining company. You’re returns will not be more then just buying the digital currency outright and earning gains.

Do you have a specific service in mind? If you send a link I’ll take a look. I’m interested to see how they work and pay out.

How much bitcoin did you buy at the time of purchase? Not the fiat currency amount but a bitcoin amount.

I’m new. Why is this dumb?

Nothing really which is why it’s important to transfer out of an exchange into your own wallet.

Got it.

Exactly. Credit is not your money, it’s money you can borrow and the credit card company sets the rules for what you can buy with the credit.

No. There are lots of coins that are mined and get passed down without ever touching an exchange wallet.

All I’m saying is they dictate how you spend the credit. They said casinos is fine and crypto is not. You have a choice to not use their service. Now if you had a checking account and they denied you, then I would have a problem.
