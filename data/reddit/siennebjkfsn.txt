Lol this is wrong. Read the whitepaper before trying to explain it to newcomers

Not sure if typo or sarcasm

I recommend you read Satoshi's whitepaper. Bitcoin's market price has nothing to do with energy that is spent on safekeeping the blockchain. What do you even mean by "expand exponentially"? Its price?

They actually did say by Jan 1, 2018. It was a public announcement (smh). Ignorance costs $

Coinbase made a public announcement in August, shortly after the fork, that it will list BCH by January 1st of 2018. Surely, with the holidays coming up, no sane company would delay its launch further than this week. Knowing this, people bought BCH to short it, driving its price up before the wake of the big announcement that finally happened today.
Not sure why such immature threats are being made when ignorance was at fault here?

He knows what a blockchain is and how it works. Which means he probably knows more about cryptocurrency than the majority of the people chasing pumps

Impossible to tell then
