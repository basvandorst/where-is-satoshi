seriously this. it's no surprise they would want to ride off the real Bitcoin's success to fuel their scammy dirty jihan shitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:32:06
serious question - why do they use "r/btc"? shouldn't it be r/bch? i thought they didn't consider themselves bitcoin at all, no?
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:46:09
she's probably on r/btc shilling that bcash aka dirty jihan coin.

@_date: 2017-12-05 18:36:40

@_date: 2017-11-21 21:08:19
absolute scum. his greed and ego is starting to turn into psychopathic narcissism. 
im taking a stand again him, dirty jihan, and that shitcoin btrash until it turns into a fucking penny stock. dead and buried.

what a journey this was... huge congrats to the r/bitcoin community for hodling strong through all the shitty events these past months. 
long live the TRUE and UNSTOPPABLE BITCOIN!
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:43:13
so what's bitcoin cash then?
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:39:42
told my closest friend to buy bitcoin at 1800 during the Bcash fork incident. Obviously, he was skeptical and didn't buy... 
Now he's asking me what shitcoin to go "all in" on to get rich quick. smdh. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:50:58
boycott that dirty jihan shitcoin!!!
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:41:30
ugh. after seeing what happened yesterday, i can only say that bitcoin cash is fucking cancer. 
ver manipulating the hell out of that dirty jihan coin really hurting the markets... just pure greed and trying to hide behind some bullshit. its disgusting.

scum who makes us realize why we need decentralization 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:09:52
I saw it happen!
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:04:47
btrash. and fuck ver and his sock puppets. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:25:51
ultra rekt.
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:29:24
at this point, he's completely lost it. poor fool. now he gets to watch his shitcoin slowly die off even after all his efforts at market manipulation - and watch the real Bitcoin continue growing.
but yea seriously, fuck this fucking fucker.

It seems like the Koreans are pumping BCH (Bithumb) - It was like this for a few days now.
Take caution if going in at the top for this  BCH run. There’s a lot of whale pump and dump groups in Korea manipulating the market with fake hype to setup bull traps.
I don’t hate BCH... it just seems too obvious and curious that this “happens” so abruptly around S2X, and the volume is coming mainly from Korea... I remember this also happened to ripple and monero a while ago.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:09:05
lol at that shithead on the far right... a fucking 60 year old bleaching his hair and dressing up like he's 12.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:31:04
this is why i avoid shitcoins like the fucking plague... especially bcash, aka btrash.

I think you mean Chinese regulations had no impact. Chinese people are still getting Bitcoins peer to peer, OTC, or however they can. Can't stop the fomo 
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:04:15
wrong. 2% is from merchants... NOT customers. It is stated clearly in the article you posted: "And for merchants, the "2% cut" TenX plans to take is no better than what they must pay out already."
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:52:29
it does. they obviously didnt compare themselves to TenX... the lowest fee card currently out with a working product - backed by Vitalik Buterin himself. I think TenX was also recently featured on Bloomberg... which definitely might mean something to speculators.
