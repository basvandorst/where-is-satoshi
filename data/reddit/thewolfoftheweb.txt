Meanwhile it's being violated on a regular basis. The law was enacted in the early 1980's, but the government was seizing vehicles, cash, equipment and other property during the Prohibition between 1920-1933.
Here is when things really got fucked... "According to journalist [Sarah Stillman]( a major turning point in forfeiture activity was the passage of the [Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984]( law permitted local and federal law enforcement agencies to divvy up the seized assets and cash" ([Wikipedia](

"Since 2007, the DEA has seized over $4 billion in cash from people who are only *suspected* of having committed a crime. In 81% of seizures totaling $3.2 billion, no civil or criminal charges were ever filed. Civil liberties advocates argue that civil asset forfeiture laws can be abused by police to shake down those they *suspect* are involved in criminal activity." - this is a perfect use case scenario for bitcoin.

Woah, that took a second to hit me. Yeah... quite appropriate. That just gave me goosebumps.

My thoughts exactly. 
This reminds me of the US during WWII, when police officers were granted the authority to detain people who they suspected of being spies/saboteurs. This was of course grossly abused, leading to around 10,000 people being detained. **History certainly has a way of repeating itself.**

Great points... if Nikola Tesla was given a pass for a Nobel Prize, I think they owe the tech / engineering crowd some reparations.

It cracks me up how they were reporting on their net worth combined, like they're conjoined twins. No, two separate earthlings.

$20k by the end of 2018 sounds like it's spot on though... judging by how things are progressing in Q3. Just wait until Q4. That's when the real magic happens.

Everyone forgets about Putin! He has a networth over $200 billion, but because he's the president of Russia no one wants to count them on their net worth rankings. If they had Pablo Escobar in there, surely Putin should be included.

I could see it being Elon Musk... but then again they are both achieving just as much as each other (simultaneously through numerous revenue streams). Bezos is worth far more, but Musk is shaping the earth and space just as much.

I've actually thought a great deal about this. There is NO WAY the government is going to sit this one out on the sidelines. Too many people, corporations and nations have too much at stake.  
I think there was definitely some CIA misinformation going at full blast, but not NEARLY as much as there was just a year ago. All the mainstream finance sites like Forbes and BusinessInsider made it sound like a total joke, but now they are having to revamp their content strategies to accommodate the new reality that cryptocurrency is here to stay.

What if it isn't one person?
@_date: 2018-07-24 03:57:34
Yeah, I'm in agreement on that also. When you look at how little the average person understands about cryptocurrency, it becomes apparent how much work there is still left to be done.  
I think the user experience / ease of use will be the key factor. Once someone like my parents can buy and transact with Bitcoin (without having to read manuals or call me 50x), that's when the real growth starts.

This is mind blowing to even think about... great article! Thanks for sharing!
