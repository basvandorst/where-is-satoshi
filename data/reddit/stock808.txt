I recently bought the nano x and a package and been using it both. But my nano x has some firmware bug from the start and still does. So I recommend the nano s over nano x. I haven't had any problem with nano s.

Gotcha! Thank you so much for replying and sharing your inputs. Then I have a follow up question. Instead of treating Bitcoin as forex medium/trading. Will it serve a better purpose of as wiring foreign currency to USD or vice versa? 
I was thinking since bitcoin value can change throughout the day, so I felt like it is not a good of an option but since it has lower fees then it is? 
But then I just learned about the existence of stable coins, so will that be better for transferring currency internationally without losing currency rates? 
Thank you again!
