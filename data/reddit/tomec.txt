How can you have enough bitcoin to just throw away like this? Is it just to get the economy stimulated?
@_date: 2012-12-25 03:19:58
Yeah it's down for me. I was just trying to sign up and get my account approved. I also checked one of those "isitdown" websites. Definitely down.

What if he gave me a code for a moneypak? Would that work?

I would be interested in 1 coin. (US) I can get you payment ASAP just message me about how to go about it. How would I identify my transaction as my own?

I rarely use skype, I'll have to see if I can even remember my password.

I know this site sells stuff straight from amazon. It doesn't look like they charge a fee or anything. Though I guess I'd warn you that I've never used this site so I don't know its legitimacy.
Anyone used this before?

The fact that it just looks like they are reselling Butterfly Labs ASICs I would say this is just a scam site. Butterfly Labs can't even deliver their own product, how would this company deliver a product that isn't being shipped? Sorry to say it, but you probably lost the bitcoin you invested there.

Well of course they are going to do their best to reel you into their scam. They're going to be polite and readily take your "order". And then they disappear because it was a scam.

It would also be cool to have some sort of group bitmessage :P I've been messing around with that and it seems awesome. But Skype works fine too. I sent my info to you in a PM.

I've ordered from bitcoin store 3 separate times. 1 external HDD, Speakers for my desktop, 1 SSD.
1. I chose Standard shipping for all of my orders. I didn't need any sort of faster shipping so I didn't check for any others.
2. It only took around 4-6 days I think. I was always really surprised about how fast the items arrived.
3. The packaging was great! The HDD and SSD were packaged in bubble envelopes with some additional stuffing around the actual drives. The speakers were in a box with some air cushion things.
4. I don't remember. USPS I think.
5. I never got any sort of shipping updates for my orders. It just sort of showed up at my house a couple days later.
6. I don't remember exactly either.
Overall I'd definitely use the service over Amazon or Newegg.

Alrighty sounds good. I'll just tell the guy it's a no go. I'm not gonna let myself get scammed out of like $200.

I think it's really inconvenient for people who aren't using smart phones and QR codes. When I tried to buy something yesterday I had to search for the view address button. Copy that. Then copy the price. I liked the old interface better.

What about a moneypak code? Is that a safe method?
@_date: 2013-07-30 12:38:34
What happened? I'm confused at this comment exchange.

I sell on a college campus. I get quite a few transactions each month. I really enjoy the business, though I'm completely high and dry now. I'll have to buy some more.
After reading what other people do, I might put up a listing for buying as well at -5%.

Maybe they intended 200 USD/EUR/Whatever? But clicked the wrong settings
@_date: 2013-04-15 11:04:03
Ha! Yeah I'm sure that's what goes on. I just don't ask. Though it's not always students. I sold to an elderly couple last week.
@_date: 2013-08-29 17:40:11
I'd be interested. Do you send a PM?
@_date: 2013-07-15 13:27:38
Sent the payment on blockchain.info with a signed message. Thanks for organizing this group buy! I'll stay in touch. I'm assuming you'll collect all of our addresses as the coins come in.
