It's true. He must feel right at home with crypto-currencies.

Probably by creating a new virtual wallet. You always spend the whole balance when using a paper wallet and transfer the rest to a new one.
Of course it might make sense having a hardware wallet if you have to move your coins a lot, but recommending one to every newbie is really just shilling for those companies. The average person who buys and holds bitcoin doesn't need one.

What would you do if you had a million Bitcoin?

Of course. That's why I wrote "for whatever reason" ;)
I just want noobies to be aware that there is a real danger of fucking up spectacularly if you don't pay attention. Writing it's "very unlikely" might give some people a false sense of security. If you send your coins to the wrong address you are never going to get them back.

Yes please, if we can get an Ethereum ETF as well. 
Man, that would be the day! A crypto ETF would be the beginning of a new era.

It definitely happens, for whatever reason.

I agree. Credit card is more convenient and free. In theory, products could be cheaper if merchants wouldn't have to pay interchage fees anymore, but for now Bitcoin fees are even higher. Amazon would also keep profits I'm sure and not pass them on to their customers. If you invest in Bitcoin you aren't incentivised to spend them as long as the price keeps going up.

The clock is ticking, btw.

Most of them are 16 year old kids. It's a new generation of crypto enthusiasts. I also don't really understand why they're so guillable, but give them some time to learn. Once we have our first real altcoin crash people will be more careful. Maybe.

Yeah, this bullshit has to stop though, if we want to attract bigger money so that Bitcoin can grow further. It's time for at least the largest exchanges to get properly regulated.

I keep my own Bitcoins in cold storage, I know the risks. However you are aware that people are trading Bitcoin, and so they have their coins in exchanges, at least some of the time, right? Even if you just want to buy or sell you have to use an exchange. Exchanges aren't going away, they are only going to become bigger and more important, just like stock exchanges.
If you were someone with a few million you wanted to invest in Bitcoin, you'd be pretty dumb to send it all to some shady exchange and just hope for the best. That's why unregulated exchanges are hindering growth. Also someone who wants to invest that kind of money is not going to want to keep it all on some hard drive or piece of paper somewhere, they want security, just like with stocks. Properly regulated and insured exchanges will provide such security.


Bitcoin is a digital ledger. 


I do use Visa all the time, to buy stuff. I never pay for anything with Bitcoin, do you? 
And I'd be so bold and claim that it's pretty much clear at this point that Bitcoin will not be the new paypal, there will be other cryptos taking that role (maybe Monero or who knows).

How is that relevant? One would hope that most people here would at least do a bit of reading up and listen to both sides before making up their mind on who is right. But it seems Bitcoin has become so large that we are beyond facts at this point, and it's all about who you side with emotionally, just like in politics :(

Because the US are the world police.
Ever heard of Assange, Kim Dotcom... hundreds of others?
