I mean I am really bad at figuring highs and lows. I don't wanna panic sell at some point.

In my country's economy that's pretty good hahah

We are on our way to 1 BTC!

Turkey, but we have other problems to deal with regarding money :)

Actually many people know it, which I find kinda weird.
Volumes in exchanges are really high and you can find what you expect in an crypto-economy. There are day to day trades, hodlers, who buy and sell in the long term etc.
Turkish economy is made to be bad but it is nowhere near Venezuela or Argentina. Hard days are ahead of us, but I really hope we make it safe and sound in the end.

3 years seem so far but also offers many possibilities. Time will tell i guess :)
@_date: 2019-05-13 11:36:25
It will be tempting, but I will try

@_date: 2019-05-13 11:35:49
That may be a good action, right now I can't stop buying in little amounts and see it adding up!
@_date: 2019-05-13 11:36:02
Hopefully :)
@_date: 2019-05-13 14:01:00
I will probably do the same!
@_date: 2019-05-13 14:01:07
@_date: 2019-05-13 11:50:32
I should probably do the same, securing my initial investment first
@_date: 2019-05-13 11:34:54
I have a ledger, liking it so far!
@_date: 2019-05-13 14:04:50
I have some LTC and ETH too, if that counts, though small amounts
@_date: 2019-05-13 11:57:29
Will keep what you said in mind. Cheers!

I am from a far far country with 0 regulations regarding crypto :)
