Apple needs to start demanding personal information and verification for these kinds of apps, otherwise you have invisible anonymous people stealing thousands of dollars.
@_date: 2016-08-27 21:54:53
Cheap and secure devices with internet capabilities that have only the goal holding and sending Bitcoins. Those would be unhackable because you don't connect them to a PC.
I don't know how you would cheaply produce something like this though.
@_date: 2016-08-15 18:48:56
Well it doesn't hurt asking.
@_date: 2016-08-17 14:15:44
The scammers right now are trying their hearts out to fuck over as many Bitcoin users as possible, be careful what you click on, people.
@_date: 2016-04-09 14:46:59
But what could you buy with .0028 BTC?
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:58:52
Actually I received them for free at the fork. ;)
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:44:06


Sounds like BTC tbh
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:10:34
Report them for *possibly* being hacked? Twitter is never gonna buy your "proof" of that.
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:46:07
BCH has multiple good teams behind it, including Bitcoin Classic and Unlimited.
The Segwit2X compromise was Segwit + Blocksize increase. This "community" activated Segwit but then started the NO2X movement, which didn't help Bitcoin in any way, shape or form.
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:29:15
What is the point of this? How does this solve any of the problems that Bitcoin has?
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:31:27
I don't want it to be true, so therefore it is not true.
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:09:28
Bitcoin is an open source protocol and anyone can use the code any way they want, just saying.
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:25:05
Responsible for the mempool chaos? So they just should stop trading BTC?
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:29:07
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:48:21
BTC is actually slow and useless, so in that sense, it fits very well with Chinese Google Pixel.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:27:33
Had nothing really to do with them but rather with Jeff Garzik's team if I recall correctly. Maybe you are correct with the bug but it doesn't really matter, the point is there was a compromise: Segwit implementation AND a 2x increase for immediate mempool relief. Core/Blockstream people then started this campaign of NO2X, saying how dangerous it is etc. blabla. 
Sorry but I just can't take these people serious anymore. Today I spent the entire day sending BTC around and had to watch block explorers for hours waiting for confirmations. It's a shit show right now, I don't even care about the price anymore, I have put everything into BCH now.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:20:02
Most nodes have always been run by miners though and they will always run nodes since they get paid.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:12:31


Hilarious assumption right here
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:47:19
You still hold BTC? May the gods have mercy on your soul.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:21:32
What kind of argument is that? lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:35:33
I googled "Segwit2X team" and I didn't find much.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:53:15
Do you know what happens if the transaction is not confirmed after a long enough time? It will drop of the mempool. So no, you do not have any choice.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:17:49
They added Bitcoin Cash which is extremely evil and therefore everyone is leaving.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:46:24
Theoretically all miners could switch to BCH in which case it would be way more secure.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:26:26


Yes I am on my knees right now praying to the developers that they finally bring us salvation.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:50:26
Here is my nr 1 suggestion: Do not use BTC for your store, the fees are ridiculous and nobody will ever buy anything through it.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:38:29
I don't really see how it is misleading.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:05:51
Who is supposed to sue him for that? Doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:28:39
You're delusional my friend. It doesn't take a lot of intelligence to look at BTC's mempool and see that it's doomed.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:29:50
What does that have to do with anything? lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:37:51
Nobody can, it's just more memery.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:15:53
Okay, I see what you are saying, but at the end of the day they are theories and you would have to find some evidence to support it and do some serious math to calculate the actual possible profitability. You also have to consider that miners rely on the transaction performance too since they need to constantly turn the money they mine into fiat, some people say that is not that feasible  .


No, to have any substantial influence on the fees you cannot spam fees that are a small. See here:  . 
If you pay 10sat/B it doesn't "push" the fees up, it just increases the bracket of 10sat/B transaction that never make it into a block. Again, it doesn't matter how many transactions you spam, if the fee is to low then everyone can pay slightly more and get through. You underestimate how many transactions people make.
Also do you agree that BTC is centralized?
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:36:38
Yeah I know...
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:31:25


Yeah and it has very good reason to, because BTC sucks lol.


Yeah, I've heard that before in 2015. Sorry but I'm out.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:42:33
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:13:13
But you cannot just "open" a channel and then use it for everything. You have to be connected to the entity that you want to trade with either directly or indirectly. Indirectly only works if there are countless channels you can hop through but then you have to hope that each channel has enough capacity to let your transaction through.
It is much more likely that you will only connect to companies directly, in which case you're still gonna have to open a lot of channels.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:07:41
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:25:24
Ok, if you say so, buddy.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:10:28
Look here: 
Your transaction fee is about in the middle of that mountain and the fees are still going up. Might not confirm, I have no clue.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:44:25
Yeah sure you can decide to pay a 50 cent fee but then it will never confirm and drop off the mempool. So effectively you *cannot* decide.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:26:50
He's not wrong, LN was said to be close to release in 2015.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:18:03


Okay, man whatever you say!
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:20:42
If I don't agree with your position then I take the contrary position and if you fail to make your case then your argument doesn't have any value to me.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:04:23
How much fee did you pay?
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:20:04
And better apparently.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:18:26


What? I lost over $100 because of fees already.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:33:46


Then you have to wait until the mempool goes down again, could take a while though...
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:15:47
Man, you just gotta wait, there are revolutionary technologies coming that will save Bitcoin. They don't exist yet, but they will soon!
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:15:37
If you say that someone collects 7 extra Bitcoins every 10 minutes and 16 million every day then you are basically implying that all the fees are collected by one entity right? (For which you don't want to give any proof).
So that means the entire network is run by one party, aka is completely centralized. Looks like the Bitcoin project has failed then? Why would I keep my money in Bitcoin at this point?


They adjust the txfee according to the average fees that have been paid in transaction in recent blocks. If I spam a million one cent transactions it doesn't have any effect, it will simply be dropped out of the mempool.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:15:24
Yeah, it's really helpful for me over there.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:02:17


@_date: 2017-12-06 22:31:25
What blocks have been 2.2MB?
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:40:21
The fees will go down again when the LN comes out, aka in about 5 years.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:19:15
Motherfucker I spent about $150 on fees already, I don't care about what immense difficulties they have to overcome. In 2015 they said it was right around the corner, how much longer will this take?
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:51:55
You keep talking about the objective of "the miners" like they are all one thing. If you are one miner and you spam a thousand transaction with a $100 fee then you might be unlucky and another mining pool finds the next block and collects all those fees. If you are saying that all miners are colluding then this is a claim that needs proof. 


The blocks only get filled by transactions that have fee priority, the rest stays in the mempool.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:23:30
Yeah, but don't say that too loud.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:28:30
Okay, m8, you go and wait for your holy Lightning Network, I don't give a shit anymore, good bye.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:27:11


Which is not gonna happen because Segwit is a piece of trash.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:44:34
So instead you can spam someone's lightning node?
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:49:25
Yeah who is gonna pay 50 bucks for a haircut?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:17:37
Did you actually ever believe that anyone was gonna integrate Segwit? And do you think they ever will if all this community does is flame them?
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:16:57
But then it doesn't raise the fees. If you spam 1 cent transaction everyone could use 2 cent transactions to get miner priority.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:25:22
Cannot see the criminal activity here but okay.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:48:38
Yeah but it doesn't have any fucking effect. If I choose to pay 50 cents then it will never confirm so therefore I *did not* send a transaction at all. If you want your money to actually arrive at the destination you have to pay the fee that the miners want.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:35:05


But if miners can control the fees and usability of Bitcoin this much to the point where it becomes useless, then I don't see how that is beneficial to the user.


Okay but we are not talking about 20 or 50 sat/B, we have reached 700 sat/B territory already. Spamming the mempool to raise the fees *is* expensive due to the reasons I have given already, there is no way around it.
Maybe you are correct that there is spamming, maybe not, but it doesn't convince me.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:01:25


So do you think people make such a decision? Or do you think that people if they send a transaction might want that transaction to go through?
Your whole argument is pointless. You can also decide to fly to the moon and then proceed to not fly to the moon because you don't have a rocket. That decision you made was completely fucking meaningless.
Fact is: If you want to use this system called Bitcoin you have to pay a certain amount of money.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:24:35
So far Bitcoin cannot do *nearly* 4MB transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:31:27


Except the HK/NY agreement was broken because 2X was not implemented.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:21:37
Bro, just wait until 2019 and Lightning will fix all your problems (assuming that all exchanges and wallets will immediately integrate it into their system).
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:21:58
You can try to find a transaction accelerator to speed up that transaction. Other than that get on your knees and start praying.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:24:48
Can you give me a link?
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:30:49
Okay, but then you need to be in a certain fee bracket, we have already reached 700 sat/B territory, spamming 10 sat/B is pointless in my opinion when it's clearly a bracket that is not relevant for what is included in blocks. At the end of the day, you *have* to spend a lot of money to make people pay excessive amounts of fees, whether or not you get all of those fees back through mining collusion is questionable.
@_date: 2015-12-22 01:17:04
Did you backup the private keys? Afaik blockchain allows you to download your wallet data.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:20:39
How is increasing the blocksize to 2MB a corporate takeover?
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:35:33
If you actually want to drive up the fees, you need to pay the fees in the first place. If someone spams 1 cent transactions then you could simply pay 2 cent and you would have confirmation priority from the miners. If what you are saying is true that means someone is paying $20-$50 per transaction to raise up the fees. The 1MB block limit has been reached somewhere at the end of 2016, you think since then someone has been spending tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars per day to do this?
It's far more likely that from all the news coverage about Bitcoin more people have been getting into it and therefore usage went up.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:25:57


Or maybe, you know ... a lot of people are using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:15:39


But to do that you would have to pay a *lot* of money. You cannot just spam 1 cent transactions, then everyone could just pay 2 cents and would get confirmation priority. If this entire thing is an attack then that must mean there are people that spam 2 digit dollar amounts per transaction, and have been doing for months. I just think it's far more likely that there are simply a lot of people using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:39:26
Another great argument.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:06:35
If you make a claim like "something is misleading" then you usually need to bring forward an explanation, I don't need to prove anything.
Not that I think this discussion it would lead to anything substantial.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:31:12


There was one, it was called "Segwit2X", and the community was like NO2X!!!
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:35:11


I don't think it's malicious, in fact I think it might save Bitcoin. I sent some BTC to an exchange a couple hors ago and paid a $20 fee and guess what? That shit is still not confirmed. What a joke.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:21:17
Really? Can you show that transaction? Just interested.
@_date: 2015-12-19 10:37:06
My grandpa used to mine bitcoins on his old windmill. Every few days he found a block and then we always had a big family dinner.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:16:15
You can try to use a transaction accelerator, last time I checked most of them were down, you're gonna have to check. Other than that you cannot do much for now. Next time I reccommend using something that is not BTC.
@_date: 2015-12-17 19:00:11
Running a node only makes sense if you keep running it forever and that means that you're gonna have to keep spending time and energy on something that doesn't give you a direct reward.
Why do that when Bitcoin dependant groups and organizations are gonna run nodes anyway to ensure the survival of their business?
@_date: 2015-12-19 10:39:47
I don't get it. What kind of machinery do you need to still make profit?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:24:21
I would love to have some good juicy Bcash right now.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:29:33
I would like to have a more trustworthy source maybe.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:31:16


No it wouldn't. First of all nodes have no economic activity unless they are full nodes. Full nodes are run by miners, they are the ones that work the blockchain and through miners the network will be centralized.


Yeah right, except there is zero proof for that. You assume that the 1MB capacity is enough for all people right now who are doing trading? And it's not the fact that 1MB is simply not enough?
@_date: 2015-12-17 19:44:59
I agree that it's better if we have a lot of nodes instead of a few but I'm just questioning if it's feasible for a private person to keep operating a full node. The best node is the one that runs uninterrupted for 24 hours a day which is only possible in an environment where electricity cost and upkeep are not a problem, so probably some kind of organization that has the capabilities and will to support the decentralization.
Sending nodes to space that function automatically through solar energy would probably pretty cool.
@_date: 2015-12-17 01:00:08
Full nodes should probably only be run by organizations who are fond of Bitcoin, it doesn't really make sense for normal users to run a full node.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:14:07


Or you know... because of things that happen here.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:42:02
No, for a general transacion you have to pay a fee to a miner. Since they can only confirm so many transactions per second, they prefer the more expensive fees.
@_date: 2015-12-17 17:40:48
Well okay, if you constantly wanna run your computer to download the neverending blockchain while constantly having to upgrade your data storage, then sure go for it.
@_date: 2015-12-31 12:10:54
What hardware do people use to still make profit?
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:30:56
You sent *2 dollars* of Bitcoin? Oh boy...
@_date: 2014-03-10 00:36:25
Of course they will.
@_date: 2018-05-23 10:09:17
Improves every day? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:27:36
You are attempting to use BTC for something? Are you mad? The thing is completely useless.
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:42:06
That's not a stereotype, that's a joke.
@_date: 2014-04-01 15:14:20

I knew is a bunch of humorless dumbasses and wouldn't like it. I think I will unsub, people here just annoy me too much.
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:49:27
Your spelling right now is a hundred times better than the spelling of the person who wrote those emails. If you have a certain sense of order, you always try to write in a way where you think it is as comprehensible as possible. This whole thing doesn't make sense. We have seen Satoshi on the forums, he speaks perfect English, just because he doesn't care as much when he writes emails or reviews doesn't mean he would write like a 12 year old. I am 99% sure the person who wrote those emails is someone different from the Bitcoin creator.
@_date: 2014-03-09 21:15:53
I know you didn't but what else was that stereotype based on?
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:25:06
I think you should give Dorian the access to the Bitcoin address, as a software developer he should be able to figure out how to use it. But of course if he wants it in USD, you should convert it.
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:48:47
I agree. The fact that he keeps denying even to his family that he has created Bitcoin and that even though his family could really need money, he doesn't seem to be willing to use his coins seems a bit odd to me. Maybe he *really* isn't the right person? What we have is the name Satoshi Nakamoto and the fact that he has worked in computer science environemts. But there are probably many Satoshi Nakamotos on this planet.
Although if he really was concerned about his anonymity, why would he use his real name?
I have to admit out of all possible Satoshi's that have been proposed so far, this seems to be the best catch by a long shot, but we still have no 100% confirmation as long as he doesn't admit it himself.
EDIT: Okay apparently Satoshi does admit it was him by saying "I'm no longer involved in this."
Well, it really seems like it's him after all, as long as the author of that article didn't make anything up.
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:02:21
Some people have hundreds of BTC.
@_date: 2017-02-15 08:51:10
The alternative is a low performance system that cannot compete with other payment solutions. Besides, most normal people don't run nodes anyway.
@_date: 2017-02-03 19:35:23
My daddy does and he works at Nintendo
@_date: 2017-02-28 11:08:34
Yeah or we just upgrade the real software without sidechains.
@_date: 2017-02-27 17:34:05
A lot of other cryptos don't have Bitcoin's problems such as small blocksize.
@_date: 2017-02-15 08:47:03
Why would people stay on the old chain? Not to mention the wallets would all update to the new version.
@_date: 2016-01-20 18:26:40
He didn't really say it's worthless, he said if it became too big the government would stop it.
@_date: 2016-01-30 16:05:07
That is something different because an ounce is just a weight, everybody knows you can divide matter into smaller matter.
@_date: 2017-02-03 18:15:30
Yeah it's ridiculous, Bitcoin will never be mass adopted in it's current state.
@_date: 2016-03-11 19:58:52
Yeah but it's visible if the coins have been extracted if the sticker is removed.
@_date: 2017-02-03 20:26:49
I'm all for it but I don't have the power to make it happen.
@_date: 2016-01-21 17:58:21

@_date: 2016-03-11 13:15:25
The QR code has the information of the private keys of this small wallet. Any conventional bitcoin wallet software can import the wallet through a QR scan and that's how you add the value to your online wallet.
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:31:41
The longest chain is the valid chain as Satoshi himself said. Going by your logic what we currently have is also a altcoin because the original Bitcoin didn't have the 1MB cap.
@_date: 2016-01-27 23:55:55
Also it's pretty simple and convenient to pay with BTC assuming you have a cellphone or some other mobile device that can hold BTC and it's no messing around with personal information.
The only downside right now of course the confirmation time.
@_date: 2016-01-27 23:52:09
You would have to wait for one confirmation yes which could go very fast but it also could take forever. I think this is Bitcoins biggest weakness right now when it comes to buying something in a physical store.
@_date: 2017-03-20 13:34:18
They process your transactions and everyone elses, they are the reason why Bitcoin works, and that's why they get paid.
@_date: 2016-03-12 01:29:35
That's correct. But the idea is that it can be used as physical bitcoin as long as the sticker hasn't been removed.
@_date: 2017-03-19 11:07:05
A vocal minority? You have no clue what's going on, do you? In literally every Bitcoin community people have been discussing the forthcoming upgrade, which will probably very soon happen.
I'm done, you must be one of the stupidest people I have ever talked to.
@_date: 2016-01-21 21:26:02
Honestly I really don't wanna move around big funds and then invest in something different. I'd rather keep Bitcoin how it is. If there are changes to be made, then they should be done to every client, I don't like the cocept of a fork.
@_date: 2017-02-27 17:35:38
Or we could just upgrade the damn software to fix the blocksize issues without problems.
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:49:37
Wow what an amazing solution to the problem this is!
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:46:19


How is it false? If 75% consensus is reached, the miners will be able to validate larger blocks than 1 MB.


For a currency that is basically electronic cash, fast and inexpensive is very appealing. The currency can be used to make micropayments online but also to quickly buy food in a store. Bitcoin could be used to replace traditional money and not just to store value how it can only be used now.
@_date: 2016-01-13 01:48:17
The day when I look at my Bitcoin wallet and all the coins are gone because I got hacked will be the day I jump out of the window.

If Bitcoin Unlimited gets activated with the majority of hashing power, it wouldn't really make sense to use the old Bitcoin since it's gonna be slower and more expensive.
This almost fanatic sentiment that we always have to use the old version of Bitcoin is pretty pointless.
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:31:44


This is what Satoshi wrote:
"Forgot to add the good part about micropayments. While I don't think Bitcoin is practical for smaller micropayments right now, it will eventually be as storage and bandwidth costs continue to fall. If Bitcoin catches on on a big scale, it may already be the case by that time. Another way they can become more practical is if I implement client-only mode and the number of network nodes consolidates into a smaller number of professional server farms. Whatever size micropayments you need will eventually be practical. I think in 5 or 10 years, the bandwidth and storage will seem trivial."
If blocksize wasn't an issue, then processing a large amount of transactions at the same time becomes possible and the fees don't need to be enormous for the transaction to be confirmed within a reasonable amount of time.

@_date: 2017-03-17 09:17:12
You seriously think the small blocks being clogged is not a problem?
@_date: 2017-03-22 15:36:51
There is no such thing as "the bad guys", the world isn't black and white. In general killing the minority fork makes sense because it leads to Bitcoin being truly "upgraded" without there being 2 chains running at the same time. Also your private keys will still work for BU so you won't lose anything. 
However I do agree that this approach seems quite unnecessarily aggressive.
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:52:37
Your logic doesn't make sense, are you a Chinese miner maybe? Because otherwise I don't know how this is beneficial to you.
If the band performs badly and is very expensive, people are at some point gonna go to a different band that has more to offer and cheap tickets.
@_date: 2017-03-20 13:29:55


Nice, so you let yourself be brainwashed by these people.
Do you even know about the scaling issue that Bitcoin has? Or are you incapable of reading?
@_date: 2017-03-20 13:46:31
So what are you gonna do? If the miners say these new blocks are valid, then they *are* valid, no matter how much you dislike it.
You can try to keep the old chain alive but that is gonna be pointless because the old chain is gonna be slow and expensive.
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:39:00
Are you fucking serious? If it wasn't broken, the whole community wouldn't argue whether or not they should upgrade to BU or implement SegWit. In fact it seems like the BU hard fork will happen.
You really have no clue what's going on.
@_date: 2017-03-17 09:24:18
If you buy a cup of coffee with Bitcoin (which I have done in the past as some stores are Bitcoin-only) it is a problem. And don't tell me this is not what Bitcoin has not been designed for, it used to work in the past and other cryptos can do it as well. If you think the radical increase of fees is no problem then there is no way to help you.
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:30:27
Ok, if you want to pay $5 transaction fees at some point, then have fun with your amazing Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-22 21:09:26


So, again, what we have now is an altcoin? Because the original Bitcoin didn't have the 1MB cap.
If the majority of the hashpower decides to run this version, then it will be the major chain, and it will not be an attack. 
After that they could of course decide to destroy the old chain, since they have the power to do it and see no value in it.
@_date: 2017-03-22 21:05:44
I hope you know, everyone and their mom can run a node.
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:08:38
You seem like a very angry man with little knowledge. 
The blocks are too small for the demand, the network is basically overloaded and transactions take forever to confirm and have higher and higher fees. This can't go on forever obviously if we assume Bitcoin adoption rises.
@_date: 2017-03-20 13:23:43
They process the transactions?
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:55:04
Great 1-sentence posts, dude.
Okay you said "buying coffee wasn't the design goal of Bitcoin".
What a worthless statement. Bitcoin's goal was to be electronic cash with the feature of micropayments, which would include buying a coffee.

Well you said Bitcoin shouldn't be used as a micropayment option but Satoshi clearly said it otherwise.
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:06:06
Hostile takeover?
They didn't write the code, they just accept it. And since they *run* the Bitcoin network they are the ones who decide which upgrade Bitcoin will receive. 
Besides a hard fork is irrelevant if the the old chain dies, your private keys will still work on the new version.
@_date: 2017-03-20 10:33:36


You realize Blockstream is a for-profit organization that manipulates Bitcoin for their own benefit, right?

I can recommend a few articles you should read:
@_date: 2017-03-18 10:37:37


No it's not, it used to be good, but now it's slow and expensive. Why? The 1MB block size limit is bottlenecking Bitcoin heavily. There are many other cryptos that offer more anonymity, more transactions per second and lower fees. Bitcoin's performance is atrocious right now.
The software should have been upgraded a long time ago but people still sabotage it.
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:18:03


True, that's why the guy said BU is a scam.
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:28:45
With people like you ignoring issues that slowly arise Bitcoin is surely doomed.
@_date: 2017-03-23 13:19:25
Read this thing Satoshi said: 
"They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of
valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on
them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism."
I don't think you know how consensus works. If you have 1000 or 10000 Core nodes, how does that influence the Unlimited blockchain?
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:53:37
Satoshi himself suggested a blocksize increase, how is that approach cancer?
@_date: 2017-03-23 13:50:18
What you don't quite understand is that what Satoshi in the white paper called "nodes" are in fact miners.
Read this: 
long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to
attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers." (Nodes in our sense don't generate chains).
Or this:
"This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides
a way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them.
The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending
resources to add gold to circulation."
This is an early concept of Bitcoin where Satoshi still assumes that people mine with their CPUs. He also assumes that those who mine Bitcoins are the ones who hold nodes.
What we now consider nodes are just PCs holding the blockchain and signal to other nodes that they have the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:04:05
The miners don't attack (or overpower) the existing chain, they mine more blocks with different rules and outpace other miners who mine blocks with the old rules.
@_date: 2017-03-19 12:48:00
seems to be a for a big part a group of people with almost *fanatic* views, with arguments like "there is only one Bitcoin" when Satoshi himself said the Bitcoin software could be upgraded to allow larger blocks at some point.
@_date: 2017-03-23 10:40:15
People can also run a 1000 BU nodes, who cares?
@_date: 2017-03-20 13:24:13
Well, it's true though, the miners process the transactions in the blockchain, what did you think?
@_date: 2017-03-23 23:37:53
Segwit has its own share of issues and it's not a *clean* upgrade.
@_date: 2017-03-22 15:15:25
He didn't say $100, he said one or multiple channels at $100+ each. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 13:28:15
Segwit, even if it perfectly works how they hope it will, is gonna be a small help at most to the full blocks problem so at a certain amount of Bitcoin users, we're gonna have to hardfork anyway. The best way is to upgrade Bitcoin in a clean way.
@_date: 2017-03-19 12:10:12
Good summary. It has to be said though that while neither side of the "coin" is perfect, the discussions on seem much more intelligent than what I have read on here.

He was talking about an older implentation though were the blocksize was supposed to double every 2 years. Also he assumed that just because you increase the maximum blocksize, the blocks would automatically fill up to the max every time.

Well the mempool has reached 100MB before, are you telling me this was the cause because some miners filled the blocks for no reason?
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:30:22
I think.
@_date: 2017-08-27 10:49:09
"The miners" are not a group of people who work together, they are groups who compete. If you spam the network and find every single block you would get those fees back but that's not happening.

Of course it's working as has been shown with BCH. We are not gonna scale to Visa levels right away and Moore's law will always be an important factor. If someone comes up with a smart other solution that is not forced down our throats then that can be discussed too.

You actually have better point than most people on here, although I think you simply cannot predict how fast Bitcoin's userbase will grow in 35 years, if Bitcoin keeps up like this, probably not a lot. 


Well I haven't calculated that so I'm neither gonna agree or disagree with you on that right now.
What you are saying about the nodes is true, but that's just a theoretical future. At the current point in time it would have been better to have upgraded the blocks to a larger size instead of installing Segwit which has as expected no effect on the transaction throughput. Bitcoin needs to work now and not in a couple months. When Gavin and his team came up with Bitcoin XT, they did it to prevent Bitcoin reaching this current state where most transactions are constantly stuck by upgrading Bitcoin in the simple way and let it function how it has functioned before.
If there is a smart off chain way of scaling Bitcoin that doesn't overcomplicate the system, sure it can be discussed and tested but I don't support these tactics that Core has been using.
@_date: 2017-08-27 11:08:43
So you are telling me all miners (which are thousands) who mine in all types of mining pools have all come together to spam the network?

Can you explain what you mean?
I have exported my private keys from the Blockchain wallet and secured. What could happen that could make me lose my coins?

The only thing that could go wrong is Bitcoin gets hacked (which I don't really think is possible) or if I lost alls my coins.
@_date: 2017-08-27 11:17:17
Well it kind of is because the block propagation depends on the data throughput.
His main argument seems to be that the Chinese cannot handle the bandwidth which I doubt to be honest, they could probably easily upgrade their bandwidth if necessary.

@_date: 2017-08-27 20:46:58


I'm not talking about the average transaction size, but one test 8MB block was mined without problems.


You assume that we instantly reach Visa levels which is just not true, we will not even reach Paypal levels anytime soon. And even then, the average user is not even running a node and is not supposed to run a node. Nodes for the most part are run by miners, businesses and other Bitcoin related groups. If you are a normal user and you want to run a node, maybe you need to spend a bit more money than a Raspberry Pi but that's just how it is.
@_date: 2017-08-28 17:16:21

The whole idea is that users shouldn't need to worry about setting up their own payment channels manually, unless they're "advanced" in their computer literacy.
Or we just increase the blocksize so we can send Bitcoins normally without having to worry about that crap.

The problem is that there aren't really 'miners' anymore. These are large entities who control large percentages of the hashrate and you can't catch up to them anymore.
@_date: 2016-02-02 20:53:56
Can translate to German if you still need something.
@_date: 2016-02-07 22:03:05
Of course mining is supposed to be profitable, that's the entire concept of how Bitcoin is run by capitalism, no human being lets his computer run 24/7 for no reason whatsoever. And yes people did stop mining when it wasn't profitable, most of the hashrate right now is controlled by a few people, most in China.
@_date: 2016-02-07 22:39:06
That's not true, there was a time when mining was profitable for everyone, now it's not profitable for anyone. Check the calculations, you can't make any profits whatsoever, you always lose.
Only when you have a large percentage of the hashing power and constantly find 25 BTC blocks can you make a profit, you need to have a mining farm for this.
@_date: 2016-02-07 17:31:55
No, one entitiy finds the blocks and they get small shares depending on how much they contributed. But these shares are so small now that it's not even wort your time.
@_date: 2016-02-07 14:20:32
Yeah individual mining has not been possible for a while. You probably need a multi million dollar investment to find blocks.
@_date: 2016-02-02 02:05:16
The main thing is the amount of computing power you can afford with your budget. If you were in theory able to amass enough ASICS that you own 50% of the hashrate, you would find statistically a block of 25 coins every 20 minutes, that's way more money than you could lose for your electricity (almost $30 000 per hour). Eventually you will go into the profit and then the money printing begins.
So it's just that Chinese mining farms own such a large percentage of the entire mining power that they find blocks constantly. Maybe if people in other countries had started similar farms early on, they would be able to compete with the Chinese now but right now it's probably not doable, the hashrate is in the skies, you can't really start from scratch.

@_date: 2016-02-07 14:14:43
Most of the hashrate is owned by a few people with mining farms who search directly for blocks. If one mining farm adds more ASICS to get a higher percentage of the hashrate, the other farms will answer to stay competitive. It's a power struggle.
@_date: 2016-02-15 01:57:16
Miners will probably either quit or hold on to the coins until they are more valuable. More likely for the price to go up than down.

Everytime someone gets poorer by losing coins, we all get richer because we now own a larger percentage of the total amount of bitcoins that will ever be created.

They are not mining invalid blocks, if that protocol has more hashrate it is the real Bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-11-24 22:06:23
That's true but even if a device is profitable doesn't mean that the amount you make is worth the entire effort. If you make 5 cents per month you might as well not mine at all.

How are people still mining with this difficulty? You'd need several big ASICS to make any profit at all.
@_date: 2018-04-01 18:01:39


Unless it has any significant hashrate compared to the competition it's never gonna do anything.

You can also buy coins directly from other people, you don't always have to put in your information into an online database.

No wonder, without scaling solution Bitcoin cannot be adapted by the masses.

Yeah but if you think the price will go up, you might as well buy bitcoins and save yourself the hassle.
@_date: 2017-05-08 15:02:06
Not really.

In what context did Satoshi say that? Just curious.

FlexibleTransactions is a much cleaner way to fix malleability.
@_date: 2016-07-10 14:18:59
My theory is this: Since most of the mining is done by large Chinese mining farms who own such large percentages of the hashrate that they simply suck in the majority of Bitcoins produced, they just still make so much that they don't need to stop. If you are a small miner who makes $2 per day profit, maybe you would stop but if you made millions a day then you would still just keep going, even with less profit, it's still free money.
Also while more and more of the smaller miners over the years have stopped mining, that percentage has then just been sucked up by the Chinese farms, so in the end all of the mining will be owned by a few organizations who all get such a big piece of the pie that they don't need to worry about going into the minus.
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:22:28
The amount of people who ever knew anything about Bitcoin in the CPU mining era is so tiny, you're probably never gonna find one that has a wallet, let alone with still coins on it.

The one we deserve but not the one we need right now.

It's not without potential risks, see here: 
However I don't think the miners are gonna use a version of Segwit that's gonna be harmful (at least I hope).
@_date: 2013-05-16 23:36:12
Has it something to do with cryptography?

Wow I can't even solve the second riddle. I have no idea what that picture means.
@_date: 2013-05-08 09:26:40
A visualization like that could be very useful, I'd like to see something like that included in the Bitcoin client.
@_date: 2013-05-11 00:18:28
As far as I know BTC can be as low as "0.00000001". But our world population is 7 000 000 000. And god knows how many Bitcoins will be lost in the future.

I am like half color blind, I didn't even see it was red. But I got it now.
@_date: 2017-06-18 07:13:09
Layer 2 solutions necessary maybe at some point in the future. At the current moment Bitcoin can easily scale onchain. 
Segwit in itself was never necessary, the miners simply made a compromise because so many people have the blind belief that it's required.
@_date: 2013-05-16 23:20:06
I think chromosomes might be far fetched. Could be wrong though.
@_date: 2013-07-07 13:41:32
The price would be pretty stable if people used Bitcoin as a useful trading tool and not just as a money-making investment.
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:12:05
Sorry, but I don't see a problem with mBTC, people have already been using it since it's official in the wallets and it works fine.
I don't think the people are gonna start saying "bits".

What is Bitcoinary? I would message the owners of that website that Stryder is a thief. Maybe they'll do something.

If this is not news then why did you say in your first post "Good news"?


What is wrong with you?
@_date: 2013-04-27 11:03:37
I guess the value will still boom as more and more people get into BTC but at some point in the far future it willl stabilize.

Did anyone actually ever buy an ASIC that was worth it? I mean essentially a company would be stupid to sell a money printing machine without using it themselves first.
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:39:53
Well, I think it's pretty obvious what he means. The more Bitcoin becomes mainstream, the higher the price gets. If 50% of the earth population wanted to get BTC, everyone could only hold 0.006 BTC (if it was distributed fairly).
So if we reach that point, you can be happy to own 1 BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:15:13
And you will be mad not having bought one when 1 BTC is worth $100k.
@_date: 2013-05-10 23:59:22
I am a little worried actually. Not about what Wired is doing but about the fact that BTC can actually get lost forever. What if there are more cases and at some point the amount of BTC is just too low?
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:45:05
I know what the term means but I don't think it's appropriate to use here. What exactly is emotional? A (apparently) smart man, made a statement, whether his prediction will come true or not, we obviously don't know, but is anyone really telling me, that Bitcoin cannot reach 1 million? How can at some point in the future one Bitcoin not be worth a million unless it gets hacked or banned?
@_date: 2013-05-08 16:42:09
The wallet really should not download all blocks but rather only the last x-amounts of blocks.
@_date: 2013-05-12 20:39:30
And "bin" means what?
@_date: 2013-07-07 13:38:14
If you look at it as "buy low, sell high" then the price will drop even more, because the majority of BTC users right now do that.
@_date: 2013-05-09 08:38:43
Wouldn't the client really have to download the blocks? Couldn't it just check some internet database about the block information?
@_date: 2013-08-13 09:55:30
Also you can transfer money faster than anything else to the other end of the world without anyone knowing about it.
@_date: 2013-05-22 11:32:58
Why would the dollar undergo a hyperinflation? That thought seems a bit pessimistic to me.
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:35:55
Well, they also could use it for more days than that, couldn't they?
@_date: 2013-05-12 22:50:11
Goddam I was stuck at the "part of something nEw".
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:21:49
All that doesn't matter, if they used the machine right now, they could make more money in a few days than what they are charging for it.
@_date: 2013-05-17 00:09:21


Wow really? In your last riddle the hints where in the same order right?
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:14:50
Why can't you morons just stop whining for once?
@_date: 2013-05-08 16:39:59


@_date: 2013-05-22 11:35:13
Simple. Just more people have to get into Bitcoin. If half of the world population (about 3.5 Billion) used Bitcoin (with an endsum of 21 Million) one Bitcoin will be ridiculously valuable.
