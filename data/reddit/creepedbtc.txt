To be perfectly honest I think the thing I learned the strongest is to just buy fancy hotdogs in cash.

whatever you say dude.

I guess until now I knew about how public it made everything but just sort of got by on "who cares, no one is going to track me". And really this event is pretty harmless but the whole thing freaks me out and I don't love the idea of it.

This is kinda how I feel right now.

I am well aware that I shouldn't be reusing addresses and that I should be sending my money to tumblers and all the other stuff I should be doing, that is fine, I will be doing that from now on. But I probably am never going to be doing that to buy lunch. So maybe I am going to limit bitcoin to just the things the level of paranoia and effort it requires justify. Is saying that what counts as trolling here? I am sure I am not the only person that didn't read whatever guide you are talking about and need a reminder once in a while.

Trust me, I am one billion percent grateful I got reminded at how easy tracking is this way than from any other way.

You are actually really shocked that someone used a new account to post a thread about the danger of reusing accounts? If I don't want my fancy hotdog to be linked to my substance dealer do you really think I want my reddit account linked to mentioning it?

Like I said, better him this way than the other way around.

I have no idea what conspericy theory you are trying to spin here. Do you think you are cracking the case that I used a throw away account?
