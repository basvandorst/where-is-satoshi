You guys have to remember. India Africa China are paid peanuts literally 
They make up probs 80% of the world population. 
Most are in the top 5%. A 50k job most likely top 1%
Nothing to back up my claims though :)
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:16:03
and its bullshit .I bet the richest 1% are wages above 50k a year gbp. absolute bull article
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:12:16
Are they all claimable? I know bch is
@_date: 2018-09-07 16:11:05
which one is that. im local and want another tattoo :)
@_date: 2018-09-07 16:11:34
never mind,zoomed in and seen it
@_date: 2018-08-28 12:05:04
Of course it will. Its a potential massive influx of money just like the new futures market in Nov (which is bigger news)
@_date: 2014-11-19 17:03:48
youll never get a reply. had same thing for 3 weeks and gave up chasing. went elsewhere.
sent the ids the lot so if any fraud happens to me now i know where it will be from. 
@_date: 2014-10-16 20:40:45
Anyone use UK Cards? Did you use US?
@_date: 2014-10-27 10:58:31
well it seems hit and miss, cause i know someone whose worked straight away and was halifax UK debit, same as mine. 
@_date: 2014-10-17 11:35:30
Said pending under account settings for around 96 hours then became active. Not sure if yours followed similar steps
@_date: 2014-10-06 09:35:05
I have the money but was wondering the process of buying from UK using CC. I read there was major issues last week with it. 
@_date: 2014-10-16 20:30:46
Been waiting 3 days now and i did a UK Debit card. What you tried. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 09:19:52
Why is it dumb? From UK CC. Anyone had issues. Just going to try in an hr or so
@_date: 2014-10-16 21:24:31
Cool. I suppose you got asked DOB, SSN and debit card details and that was it. Same as uk then
@_date: 2017-02-12 07:10:56
No need bro. But if u wanted just deposit to alphabay and withdraw
The recieving and sending address will be different
@_date: 2017-02-12 07:13:43
Its not the greatest
Lets be realisitc. Its going to take a while to get past ath. There are so many loose hands who bought in around now to ATH. It will take a while to shake them out then watch a shootup to 2k. I thnk mid to end 2017 we may see this
@_date: 2017-02-20 16:50:47
hasnt this been on for some time now
@_date: 2017-02-21 07:31:04
No chance. Lets hit ATH first. Theres no reason for it to go 25k. Its an unbelievable and optimistic prediction. It might already be overpriced now
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:56:43
very good point
@_date: 2017-02-27 16:47:16
theres absolutely no chance of 10k a coin or 5k. imaine how many millionaires it would create.
2-3k is tops for me. I heard a great phrase which summarises bitcoin in my view. It has too many issues right now to succeed as of right now.
"bitcoin is an experiment: maybe it WILL fail as a currency, but succeed as a commodity. "
@_date: 2017-03-07 08:01:07
Whose that
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:08:26
yh, its actually working well for me, i dont mind the drop cus my eth is pumping up. but im going to cashout soon and buy more btc. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 16:31:39
so you choose what metric we use. oz of gold has always been used. or should we revert to 1lb of gold to 1 btc
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:09:14
yh i am lol. a 70doller drop for me is a 5 figure loss on potential cashout. but been a long day trading so sorry if i sounded a nob
@_date: 2017-03-13 16:36:41
@_date: 2017-03-09 13:34:52
what is false? Capital gains?
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:06:27
Dont worry itll rebound. Might take a while
We all thought esp in the last 48hrs it will be approved
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:53:42
Who is he? 
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:59:57
haha. apologies. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:20:50
sounds even better. but can you see that happening. it needs too
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:58:31
i converted my ltc to ETH. best move i ever made. 
@_date: 2017-02-06 08:29:31
Why do they owe you money?
@_date: 2017-03-07 08:01:30
What crash?
@_date: 2017-03-03 16:19:16
We comparing to an oz. BTC is worth more
@_date: 2017-03-08 09:30:53
a $50 swing is hardly a crash
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:53:47


im not sure about that mate. enlighten me. The market cap difference is huge. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:46:42
wondering the same. cant see any bad news.
@_date: 2017-03-03 11:03:44
i hope so. ill retire straight away haha
@_date: 2017-03-03 17:16:43
what do you clasify as 1 gold. what metric. metric system been around 200 years. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:55:19
Must be new
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:59:24
Nice one. Thanks for explaining
@_date: 2017-03-03 16:16:35
He kinda has a point thats why ETF is crucial and SEGWIT
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:48:16
yh you seen my other posts. i hold shitloads of these also mate. 
its good to diverse what you own
@_date: 2017-03-03 16:18:20
"We dont know who controls is....BEWARE"
Piece of shit
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:00:35
haha. na mate. apologies. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 08:02:52
Bank transfer but abve 11k in uk is then liable as capital gains. Either split 10k across various accounts or cash in hand or mail 
Or get a close person to take 10k and so on until you have cleared
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:52:32
yes within reason. but $70 drop in minutes doesnt exactly fill potential investors with confidence.
We need it less volitile. These big drops in minutes and rises do it no good. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:15:29
itll go up. Surely no way BU can be activated. Segwit 95% is too much. That needs to be set at 75% like litecoin (44% today) more realistic
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:56:07
what troll. fuckin prick. 80% of my crypto holdings is btc. see my other posts. its dropping you blind fuck. cant you see
@_date: 2017-03-09 11:06:35
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:47:31
Not the issue. That has a chance that this bu could essentially kill btc and its value. Alt coins or rising but soon as its sorted our side watch them crash. But any if is a big IF both ways
@_date: 2017-03-03 16:15:46
what a sonofabitch. I dont think he is a supporter...
@_date: 2016-06-15 10:16:39
localbitcoins for cash maybe the way though you will lose abit. 
or send to people you trust and get them to send you.
over 11k and you will get investigated, i would always stay below 10k. last thing you want is to get taxed on it
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:54:27
Must be new
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:44:09
Id make it 50-50. There half way there
@_date: 2017-01-04 23:42:21
Then I suggest to bruteforce it. Or there are services which take a cut if they get in but I suppose thats the last resort
We talking many BTCs. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 23:48:35
Its not hard to do but will take a good hour or so to get it installed and your head around the scripting: 
Ive forgotton what it was called but will chefk my laptop and get back to you
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:38:47
likewise. haha
i had ppc and eth. ltc i withdrew a day before luckily
@_date: 2017-01-04 23:37:38
Do you think you know what it is. I have managed to bruteforce one of mine
Rough character length?
Was it alot in the wallet
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:33:00
Too me it sounds like anyone who held coins it is ok. FIAT will be lost. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 13:00:52
y the hell do people use mixers. it costs them and whats the point. if you want a free one just use a darknet one like alphabay
the depost address is different from the send address so its lost the chain already
@_date: 2017-01-23 12:04:55
What difference does it make. youve broken any connection if at all to yourself. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 15:57:07
Same, but there is alot of difference between back then and now. Alot of people are looking for a get rich quick but back then it wasnt really like that. I think itll touch 2k but beyond that who knows. 
Remember 4 years ago, alot of people said the same thing and it went down to sub $150. Not saying it is possible but there is more chance of sub 150 than 10k
@_date: 2016-12-22 15:00:44
Steady on. Lets get to 1k first then 2k. to get to 10k is unimaginable right now but could happen one day
@_date: 2015-08-04 07:53:36
will this work in the UK? for GBP or do you have intentions on doing it.
I just want to cash out some BTC to cash so I guess it wouldnt cause no issues and that would then be exempt from chargeback and verification processes right?
@_date: 2017-04-03 15:27:14
Agreed. The guy is a twat to say the least. He may legalise it though to hide his dirty money.
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:52:47
Use Barclays, the news is great at the moment with BArclays and its views on crypto or Fidor bank which is 100% bitcoin friendly. HSBC are rubbish. They closed my account down lbc selling. Held my funds for 30 days then released. Told me I could never bank with them again. 
It wasnt even a chargeback...told the truth Im selling some crypto. 
BTW, Ive been a trader on LBC since 2011 and have lost HSBC, Halifax, Lloyds and RBS. Barclays never had an issue with. Been around 3-4 years now
@_date: 2018-11-28 13:30:16
Manipulation. Simple
@_date: 2018-03-22 20:34:26
Define Large? Ive had around 7k at once but thats the max
I havent ever informed Barclays. There suppose to be crypto friendly if judging by recent articles. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:51:08
yh i have it running together with LBC. you do have numerous trades that come in. 
Ive had  Successful sales: 621 on bitbargain since 2013
and around 1000 or so on lbc
@_date: 2018-03-21 23:46:02
My first one doesn’t exist no more. Was in the early days but I now use vee-man. As you can see plenty of btc and trades over the past 4-5 yrs. as of right now....Fidor or Barclays is the one. HSBC was banned 3 years ago for no reason except there was numerous transactions. 
I also sell in bitbargain
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:54:32
Still the same.  rememebr to encrypt the wallet
I was in a similar boat. I had £50 in my paypal account which they said i couldnt withdraw for 180 days but could spend. 
In 2011 someone was selling 100btc for £50 on ebay, i looked and backed out.  i instead went and purchased a voucher code (might  have been itunes)
Spurred me on then a year or so later and then started buying. 
Moral of the story is, you cant do nothing. Just start again and make money. New slate.
@_date: 2017-10-19 10:49:39
I ditto lbc. best way or bitbargain
for cash, only lbc. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 16:18:59
Does anybody have the official proposal link and what will happen. cant seem to find it
@_date: 2018-07-16 17:26:49
took over from btc-e
Seems to be some sort of withdrawal issues which has hiked up the price. Last i knew they was charging 25&amp; withdrawal fee hence the increase in price
@_date: 2018-07-09 22:22:15
Well i need to spend the BTC somewhere, :)  and another way of avoiding the tax man
@_date: 2018-07-02 14:08:54
Also it seems that   [  or [
is probably what is causing the pump. Lets see what happens.
@_date: 2018-07-02 13:55:48
If the ETF isnt too far off either then that 68% of ATH will be gone very soon
@_date: 2018-07-09 17:17:02
Nice, great news for us UK guys.  Just waiting for a bull run and ill be looking at it
@_date: 2015-11-20 18:06:37
The block halfing wont do much next year i think the 2017 one is going to be the one looking at the table
I maybe wrong thought but there wont be much difference from now till then. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:18:24
if you cashout legally then you are liable for 20% capital gains after 11k i think
but look at my listing, and look at enterpeneur relief. goes down to 10%. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:10:17
Ive been using lloyds hsbc (who closed) and halifax but there for sales and buys without banks knowing. Fidor maybe the only one but il be speaking to the banks to request if i can cashout if i have authorisation from hmrc for 10% tax.
20% forces me to cashout illegally. And i dont want to go down that road but no way do i hand over 20% when its 100ks to me for no reason for an asset they dont accept
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:10:52
Like i said entrepreneur relief might be our way out for both banks and 10% max tax
@_date: 2017-07-27 19:36:55
Feel sorry for the traders. It could hve so easily been me.
Ive lost abit but nothing major
The website seems down atm. Not good.
Fuck USA
@_date: 2017-07-28 08:06:07
Looks like site is coming back up. im getting the twitter feed again. on and off though
@_date: 2017-07-28 23:16:40
Fuck you DOJ and fuck USA. Always getting involved when it don't concern them. Bunch of pricks. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:40:14
Well Fuck me...looks like i lose out some ppc and eth. Was going to trade for LTC at a higher ratio and was waiting. not many but you think this fool would have learnt from Gox. 
never going to get it back. Sorry all for loss
@_date: 2017-07-27 19:41:32
Well the positive is...the website isn't down brother.
It looks like someone is fannying around with settings cus it comes back up for abit and back down. 
All good signs
@_date: 2017-07-27 19:42:02
@_date: 2017-07-28 23:14:30
Fuck. Done some digging. They seized the domain name. Looks over now to be honest. Why would they come back under a diff domain name.
Wouldn't mind if someone nuked DOJ. Anybody?
@_date: 2015-10-29 22:45:18
helix grams best mixer. and you cant go wrong for the original bitcoin-qt wallet. altho the blockchain has to be downloaded. most secure for me
@_date: 2017-07-28 23:18:29
Yh I seen it. May  I take this opportunity too say fuck you DOJ and fuck you USA. Scum of the earth. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:43:36
The unscheduled maintainence was too mix our coins. Bastards!
