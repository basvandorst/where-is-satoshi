That's not true or is it? I have been wondering why kranken and btc-e (which looks shady af) have managed to not get hacked. Pure luck or is their security that tight?
@_date: 2016-04-01 07:12:52
All I can tell you that Kraken actually works togehter with the German Bank Fidor. You can't ask for a more ledgit Exchange. They won't steal your money. They respond to support Tickets pretty fast when ever my account got blocked. If they Block an account you might have problems with the feds, the Bank you withdraw to, have used a Mixer and or have blacklisted coins in your account.

"Presumably, when people mention how early they bought Bitcoin, they are implying they purchased when coins were still expensive." ????????? The article means cheap right? Or am I an adopter of bitcoin even before the "early" adoperts?
@_date: 2016-04-01 09:55:04
What should they do if the feds take that long? Is it their fault?
@_date: 2016-04-01 09:53:15
Please provide proof. I never heared of anything like this. Your account has most likley been blocked because you havn't responded to support. Have you checked your spam folder? Log into kraken again and check your withdraw history. It provides you with details on what went wrong.

I invested in April 2013 for 140€ per BTC. It dropped to 45€ in 2 days. It stayed between 50 and 85 for more than half a year. So yeah. You did the same mistake I did back then. But let me tell you what. In the end the mistake got me a new car ;)...

You can use the facebook verification but you can also enter your data manually.

Fidor is also partnered with kraken. A wire transfer from Fidor to kraken only takes two hours tops. That's the main reason I use kraken. Bitcoin.de is a trust based exchange. Takes at least two days to complete a trade. Or you trade at the same bank. Then it depends on the exchange partner how fast he cleans the transfer. That's why it makes more sense to do it with Kraken in my opinion. Also Bitcoin.de is almost German only while kraken is much more international.

Man you are salty. Just relax.  If you do not care about the topic just downvote. The rule you pointed out does not exist. You should read the rules ;).  If a mod thinks I did something wrong he can tell me. Lucky for me you are not... Anyway back to topic: I just wanted to point out that it happend. I know that a bank can be DoSed. I have a fucking CCNA... The fact that it happend made me realize that the point bitcoin can be DoSed is just as valid as for banks. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 21:11:14
Well once the verification link is used it will become invalid... So no.

Did you read the article? It is certainly possible with a rouge ssl certificate even with ssl enabled. Even though less likely. Remember ssl is centralised too. People need to realize that TOR is not for security but anonymity. Security wise TOR is dangerous with many thinks if you dont know what you are doing.
For beginners I say: "Don't use TOR if you need to login somewhere sensitve. IT IS NOT SAFE!"

Looks great!! A question, is this basically a decentralized address book for bitcoin payments? Or are my contacts stored on a server? 
@_date: 2014-10-31 13:10:07
That's true but it was always pointed out as a weakness of the bitcoin network. Now this argument does not matter for me anymore. Your credit card can also be ddosed ;)!
@_date: 2014-07-11 06:30:05
I did not say that we should throw away bitcoin and use nxt instead. I think it is important to look at other peoples / altcoins ideas who already spend an incredible amount of time of realising such a feature instead of listening to a guy who wants to distribute a virtual machine with Windows on it and who obviously has no idea how to share code which speaks for itself...
@_date: 2014-07-04 00:27:04
You need a license as soon you have a business activity going on. Meaning this guy had a lot of trades without telling he runs a business. Which in this case was trading bitcoins for cash which can't be regulated. Thats like selling video games on the street without a business registration and so without declaring tax. Germany doesn't like this and that is actually important that they do not. Otherwise it would be possible to smuggle large amounts of money without anyone noticing. 
@_date: 2014-11-15 08:00:32
gk4.me does just that. They are legit. Bought several games from them with bitcoin. Great Service 😁! 
@_date: 2014-12-02 13:48:58
I mined alot from November 2013 until April 2014 and I am still mining in the cloud. I was able to break even with everything in february and luckly sold my bitcoins before gox dragged the price to heavy lows. Right now the cloud hashing earns me 30 cents a week with over 100 GHashes (electricity already paid). 4 month ago it was about 3 € / week. It's hard. I can understand why people don't want to invest in hashing anymore.
@_date: 2014-07-04 00:19:23
They have the best support together with Bitstamp when it comes to exchanges in my opinion. Where do you get better customer service? They always replied within 24h in perfect english with very clear instructions what do to next. I mean if you try to contact the "support" at paypal you will only get an answering maschine. You really can't compare paypal "support" with the Kraken customer service. Because Kraken has a real customer service. 
@_date: 2014-05-12 13:19:57
Looks cool :)! How much do I have to pay in fees? Can't find info about it anywhere on the site. 
I would love to use Bitcoin instead of paypal or giropay. But 2% or even more in fees isn't a good deal when you life in Germany.
@_date: 2014-06-14 21:37:17
No they can't. Because they are also renting hashing power with their service cex.io. They would not be able to calculate the hashing power a cex.io user brings to the table. The solution isn't that easy.

Okay that's strange. For me it was the other way around.. Coinbase is vulnerable but Bitstamp is not ... :-S!! Then again tested on another computer I get the opposite result. Seems like the tool is not working all the time?

@_date: 2014-11-14 14:48:19
Really? Who!? I am pretty sure that Fidor and Kraken would be the first at the moment.

Have you ever tried holding a Nexus 5? Compared to the iPhone it feels like an advanced peace of design. Minimal but powerfull. I switched with the Nexus 4 which wasn't feeling as good as the iPhone but with the Nexus 5 this feeling changed completly.

It's illegal to distribute Windows on a VM! Which means this guy isn't legit. It's dead simple. Has nothing to do with being anti windows. I already wrote this as an answer but sadly named an altcoin and got downvoted in oblivion. Silly me... 
Anyhow as long as there isn't a serious dev who is implementing it this project is doomed already. I would not trust the project creator at all!
@_date: 2014-12-17 12:57:02
Ah sorry! You comment actually reads like bitcoin was broken and hacked all the time. Got it wrong. Sorry...
@_date: 2014-07-11 06:24:50
I did not say I own any. I did not say this comment was pro nxt. However I like the idea of the nxt decentralized marketplace far more than the idea brought up by this guy who thinks about distribution using a virtual machine with Windows on it which is by the way also illegal. You can say that nxt is scam I am okay with it. Because the distribution model ist kinda dodgy but till now they pay devs with this and this results in the most innovative coin I have seen to date. Why not take a similar approach with bitcoin. Have you actually seen the wallet / market design of nxt? That's how the bitcoin wallet should look like. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 17:59:24
@_date: 2014-02-17 20:07:37
Well would it actually be an issue? Supposed you never clicked this link you where never able to actually send bitcoins to this account? Am I wrong? Still they should implement a certain TTL.
@_date: 2014-03-21 19:02:28
The fee is high for german users:(. Dont have to pay any fees using traditional payment methods. Are there any advantages using your service in Germany besides using bitcoin. Dont get me wrong I will use it but I would like to introduce it to some friends.

HOLD!!!! Not True. If you do a wire transfer with a not known bank account (with not known I mean you did not use it with your acc already) from europe (dont know about US) they will freeze the hole account for a month!! That's what happend to me half a year ago. 
I had several talks with the support and their english was horrible (sometimes I had to ask again because it wasn't clear what they where saying). I provided identification and proof of residence as requested by the support. Still my account was froozen for a month. 
I was able to trade but couldn't withdraw anything. Even Bitcoins which where already on my account before the wiretransfer were froozen too.
@_date: 2014-03-22 10:46:48
Nexus 5 is also streamlined to the hardware. You are right the iPhone 5S is faster but also doubles the fucking price for 10% more speed that you dont even notice? Na don't care about specs I don't notice ;). The features count. I would even like to have less speed and more battery power. Its more than fast enough.
@_date: 2014-07-11 19:19:06
A serious dev would never do that. NEVER EVER! It's so unserious that it stinks. 
That's like saying: Hey guys I have a free solution for Microsoft Word! It's Microsoft Word running in a VM. So once registered everybody can use it!!!"
This would be useful indeed but that's def. not what open source is about.
This guy has no idea what he is doing. His idea might be good but he should not be the one to build it.
He even wrote in an answer to the topic that he has a repository now where he uploaded a zip which contained not the source but the *.exe!!! WTF?
Then a few post later and the first people saying that this guy is creepy as hell he uploaded the source code to github. Guess what, he is new to github. He has obviously never used it before. He even forgot to include the auto generated readme.md by github.
 
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:00:38
No you did not understand the hole problem. GOX gives the user an transaction id (now ntxid) which the user is able to lookup at blockchain.info in order to see if the transaction has been executed for real. Since this ntxid is generated with already existing information from the blockchain (no modification of the bitcoin network at all) blockchain.info also needed to implement this new ntxid otherwise users would not be able to verify the ntxid with blockchain.info.
@_date: 2014-12-02 16:56:56
Ye it is in most of the cases. For example I mined with cloudhashing.com. They actually fullfilled their contract but I wouldn't have hit the break even if the price hadn't exploded that much. I had to pay alot for 1 GHash for one year. With pdscmining.de however it was different. They are very transparent (I actually know the asics are running) and also located in germany (as I am) and are much cheaper. No advertising here from my part. I wouldn't invest in mining anymore! At the current price mining isn't very  profitable in germany.

Which bank is behind cryptocapital? Are your funds insured?
The thingy with Fidor is. It is a german bank, which is protected by the state. If a theft or loss occurs the users funds would be recovered by the state. At least the fiat would be restored not sure about the coins ;)...

Are you serious?
@_date: 2014-02-17 21:07:50
As far as I know Mt.Gox has a highly modified wallet software which might explain the delay. Anyway dont get me wrong here I don't want to defend them.
I'm just saying coindesk is kicking a person which is already on the ground into it's grave without proofing if the things they claim against this person (or exchange) are actually legit. This is in my opinion even worse compared to what Mt.Gox did with it's last press release. They actually revaled a legit issue. 
Coindesk with it's non proofen claims where actually driving the recovery @ gox back where it was this morning. Look at the charts you can see when the coindesk article was made public.
@_date: 2014-11-15 08:03:32
But it was not covered by the state by law.... 
@_date: 2014-11-16 11:29:48

Again try the Nexus 5. Have it since 3 Months. Not a single reboot, not a single app Crash and a bettery life of one and half day under what I call heavy usage. NFC and wireless charging support. The only draw back is the camera and the speakers. But I think for a phone which is almost 3 times less expensive I can live with that. There a even far more advantages in using it compared to the iPhone.

@_date: 2014-12-02 13:55:25
That's true. However your browser wouldn't warn you as it is still valid according to the certification agency. There have been efforts to build protection into the browsers but this protection won't work with any bitcoin related sites. According to this article it would only work for Twitter and Mozilla based Sites: 
If you check it by hand it is ofc fine. But this is not what the normal user does. That's why I think posting this -&gt; "tor -&gt; blockchain.info online wallet -&gt; bitcoin" is dangerous without telling about the risks behind it.
"blockchain.info online wallet -&gt; bitcoin" is actually more secure then "tor -&gt; blockchain.info online wallet -&gt; bitcoin"
It makes MITM attacks much more likely.
@_date: 2014-11-15 08:01:17
They do in Germany by law yes.

Thank you for the explanation. Now I understand.
@_date: 2014-11-26 16:33:13
More info regarding this topic: Tor makes it more difficult to perform a man-in-the-middle attack targeted at one specific person with the blessing of a rogue SSL certificate. But on the other end, Tor makes it easier for people or organizations running exit nodes to perform large scale MitM attempts, or attacks targeted at a specific server, and especially those among its users who happen to use Tor.
Even more:

His death was caused by an inflammation in his brain. His story is very tragic. He lost his parents when he was very young. Expert said that he can not survive without his parents even if a human tries to raise him. The german media was furious because the zoo wanted to kill him instead of trying to save him. After some bad press the zoo tried and it seemd as if he might life for a few years. In the mean time the human who raised him died. Guess what also because of an inflammation in the brain. So his second parent also died. A few month later the polar bear Knut then passed. A very sad story but it had nothing to do with the temperatures or not enough room for him to live. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 20:01:14
Actually I liked coindesk a lot but since a month or so I have the feeling that the editors use the news site as some kind of market manipulation. First the nextcoin article now the gox bashing driving the price even more into the ground. 
As it might be true that Mt.Gox isn't the best exchange for btc they still have some reputation left in my opinion. MtGox is still partner of the foundation and besides Mt.Gox - Bitstamp and BTC-E where also affected. Since BTC-E has no real support it wasn't such a big deal I guess. 
I can not believe that the issues with the txid caused to much dmg. They won't just give away 100 BTC because the txid is wrong. They then just have to wait for the blockchain to verify the transaction.
Even if coindesk is right this article was written without any proof. Speculations should not be executed by a serious news site.

Holy moly. The min fee is 5€? This should be the max fee! You do realize that you do not have to pay any fees in Germany when using traditional payment methods? What is the advantage of using your service? After I have already paid 2% to actually convert fiat to bitcoin. This gives me a total of 4% in fees. That's huge! Don't get me wrong. I like the service you are offering. For some early adopters this might be a good deal. But is there something I am missing which makes me want to use your service despite the big time fees? 
@_date: 2014-03-22 10:39:29
I think the value it looses is exactly the price of a new Nexus 5 (and you can still sell it if you like after two years). So if you calc that you will actually save money.
And I arguee with you that people always want Apple products. I was a heavy apple supporter since mac osx 10.4 (when they switched to intel and xp/vista was released).  But since Steve Jobs died they lack innovation even often block it. I don't use iOS any more and replaced my iPad mini with a new nexus 7 (which is great by the way), osx with windows 8.1 (also far better for my purpose) and well my iPhone just died after two years (no resell value).
@_date: 2015-05-28 23:32:56
Then please, tell me how purse.io gets the discounts? I mean it is not their fault but the service is a paradise for cc fraud.
@_date: 2015-05-28 23:34:58
Sad. It seems like people really want to close their eyes and use a service to good to be true. But we all know: Someone looses. Someone has to loose. But it is okay as long as I get my discount ;).
@_date: 2015-05-11 13:43:51
I am living in Cologne, Germany. The article forgets one thing. You can acutally get cash from any other bank not even paying fees. The only thing that might happen is that you need to walk another 10 Meters in order to use another banks atm. If nothing helps you can still pay with your EC/Visa/Master/Whatever Card. Also it is only a small region of germany actually effected. I did not even know about this till I read the article here!
@_date: 2014-12-18 13:48:38


I call BS. That is something you can not know! Also I can't think of anything that is really preventing fraud for 100%. Paypal also uses "anti fraud systems" and we all know how good this works.
@_date: 2014-11-15 08:21:14

That's what I thought. I never had a problem with sending money from germany to kraken using fidor. I think kraken can't do shit if there is a investigation which is not in their hands. Also use Bitcoin.de if you have problems with your bank account. Then the hole transaction looks like a private transaction and you are good to go.
@_date: 2014-12-05 12:53:32
You need to be careful here. If the paypal account is hacked they will decide in favor of the hacked "buyer". I guess using Paypal to buy Bitcoin just doesn't work...
@_date: 2015-01-23 13:25:42

Ye. I think that this is important. Changetip is for Tipping and not Spending Bitcoin. Would still be nice if it would handle both.
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:17:53
Well it is a possibility. If someone was able to compromise your iCloud it would be possible to get all the Data needed even without logging in into any service. 
For example if it was possible to clone your iPhone just open the blockchain app and send the bitcoins to another adress.
EDIT: I just saw your updated response. Wrong trail on my side then. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 13:17:17
He has no smartphone ;). Ofc setting up a blockchain.info account is also easy. Put that is not my point. I would like to have a solution where people don't even know that they just used bitcoin. You don't need a personal secure wallet when someone sends you 15 bucks. If changetip would have a hot wallet all would be good in my opinion. Once you gather larger amounts of tipps you can still figure out a way how to secure your coins.
@_date: 2015-01-23 13:19:59
Don't you need to verify your account as soon as you withdraw something?
@_date: 2015-01-13 05:58:27
Sure something changes without bitcoin. You would not be able to send money without a middle man. What the Internet is for Communication, Bitcoin is the same thing for money. Did you know there were other and in my opinion better Protocols around then the Internet as we know it today. But the Internet was there first so as Bitcoin. There is a strong possibility that it will stay this way. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 14:05:38
What are you talking about? 
@_date: 2014-11-26 16:21:41
Holy shit No! With a bad exit node it is possible to steal your bitcoins even with 2FA enabled. It is one of the most common ways to execute a man in the middle attack. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 13:17:10
Well I guess the ios app uses an api key which is only allowed to view the balance. If you try to move coins it should immediately ask for the 2fa. Everything else would be horrible security wise!

I am talking about giving someone a beer without the need of a manual. I agree with you. It is actually very easy ro set it all up.

If you now order a pizza and have to pay with bitpay you need to make sure that it doesn't take longer then 15 minutes. Perhaps it is worth a try but I am worried that with my luck the transaction will take longer then 15 minutes.

If I understand the service correctly they offer you the same as kraken and other fiat/crypto exchanges. Storing different currencies and cryptos in one account. Where is the bank in this story?

Okay lets do it slow for you:
1. Business Model:
Ships real physical goods to a real address. CC fraud is very difficult because you need to provide an address where you will get the package without giving up your real name.
2. Business Model:
Digital goods are being payed with CC. In return you will get the digital item. High CC fraud rate BUT the company takes the risk. That is why you often have to give them your phone number so that they can call you and verify that you actually made this purchase and so that they can tie a real number to a purchase.
3. Business Model:
A company takes fees for being the middel man and in return insures a smooth exchange. Let us call the company Purse.io. Users can say hey I will pay for your item on Amazon which acutally goes to your real address and the purchase is tied to your account. I will pay with CC and I am willing to cut you 25%+ for it. GREAT thinks the other user and accepts! Everything works out at first. Item is delivered no problems at all. But now lets wait a few months. Some CC owners think W8 a minute. Why am I paying that much for my CC!? Voila now the law is in the boat. And guess who the only person is who can actually be tied to the hole thing? The one who used a fraudulent service called Purse.io. Everyone else is not known. And now comes the bad part. Even so you paid with your bitcoins for it you are in possession of stolen goods. You need to return them and wont see any money for it.

Well lucky for him that he made this public and purse.io was able to make a PR stunt out of it. Problem still remains that stolen CC are being used. If you are lucky it wont come after you. Still the one who did not notice that some dollars where spend without him loses. Again take it out of your mind that purse.io would work with a 25% bonus without CC Fraud. It just does not make sens. Just give me one reliable argument why would somebody use purse.io to buy bitcoins instead of circle with a fee difference from 25% to 2%? It does not make sense at all but CC Fraud explains everything.

I guess accepting bitcoin is more of a gesture then anything right now. In your calculation you missed chargebacks/fraud which is a big plus for bitcoin.
I agree with you that bitcoin needs to grow and needs to get more userfriendly (it actually is userfriendly already but rather unknown how to use it). However it might also happen that big payment processors adapt bitcoin as their backend to transfer money without the need of a proprietary payment network. That way users and companies won't even know that they just used bitcoin. This is also already happening.

No they said they have an issue with cloudflare. This does not mean that the issue is caused by cloudflare. That is a wrong interpretation. The message was meant in context that this isn't a hack but a simple certification issue with cloudflare.

Thanks for the info. I will try!

Just paid for the paywall. Worked like I have always imagined micro payments should be. This is a great example! Here is also a piece about bitcoin:

Actually nxt already implemented a decentralized exchange. The project dev of this project seems to be a bit unexperienced... but I might be wrong. Anyway good luck! 
@_date: 2016-01-27 07:24:43
And they are absolutely right! Even if the only issue would have been an expiered credit card it would still have been an issue with cloud flare and not a hack :D... Nobody was saing it was Cloud Flares mistake. I dont know what the CEO of Cloud Flare was thinking.

The Problem with most bitcoin news sites is that they investigate less then Fox news or just lie in order to write something. The outcome of the discussion is that it is simply not true and that MS has no access whatsoever on your hard drive. They however must comply and give the state access to your One Drive if the curt orders to do so like any other us based cloud storage service provider.

I fifth this. Superb support. Stable. And In germany I can make instant wire transfers (&lt; 10 min) from my FIDOR bank account and back(&lt; 1h). It's amazing!

Again a person with some money or even better botnet in the bank could just fire up nodes. How is it better then it was before? Wouldn't it even get worse?

What are you talking about? Half of my servers have an IP below 128.

I still don't get it but thanks for trying! I will read some more about it before jumping to false conclusions.

I believe it was his view of what might happen and not of what is happening right now. So there is ofc no evidence. He is known for these kinds of theories. See here:

Bitcoin.de also works as long as you have a swiss bank account. Kraken is the fastest and easiest option I believe.

Saying it is not possible is a bit naive. When one can modify a hardware component alot can be done. You can reconstruct a computer screen by recording the electric waves send by the gpu....

That is surely true ;)

Bitcoin  is open source. It is in your hands to port it to another platform. It was also written in c++ which basically  means that the first binary distribution was Windows only. Anyone who knows how to compile could have compiled it for his favourite Platform. Anyway it wasn't my Intention to hate. I just can not test the project right now. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 20:18:19
It's on Kraken (the exchange). Was trading manually and just waiting for that moment all day :)!
@_date: 2015-11-07 17:12:47
I did not say it is good ;)!

Its r/bitcoin... Also completly ignoring Dash which is also an anonymes coin and in the top 10 marketcap wise since more then a year. According to r/bitcoin every other coin is floundering.

jdownloader is an application to download files. This is a service to get access to 50+ premium hosters for the price of one. Doesn't look to good though...

I can confirm it is not up for west germany :(... Best timing as always.

Yes the server handels all connections. The files will be saved on your server. You need to download them from your server once they are finished.

"For the unlikely event that your merchant still does not accept bitcoin, cashila is the way to go - really great service!" oO?? I mean cmon? To much marketing going on there.

Thanks for pointing that one out! Sad that you can not use Bitcoin  for Pizza any longer :(....
@_date: 2016-05-31 05:38:29
I did this a long time ago with btc-e and bitstamp. It kinda worked. But it is risky because Exchanges need sometime to payout and confirm (2 - 3 hours). Price might have already changed to the worse.

Yes! Gandi supports dnssec. glue records and secondary DNS with ease. Namecheap doesn't even support Dnssec at all! Namecheap sucks when you compare them to each other.

Amazon uses big data to analyze it's useres behaviors to find a best match on what else might interest you. If you would not be interested in bitcoin it would not show up.

March 2013 -&gt; Invested when price skyrocket to 220$ and then fell down to 50$. Bought at 140$. It hurt alot back then. 
Also started mining (got my BFL :D and 10 of those small usb sticks...) and actually made a profit thanks to mtgox manipulating the price.
Now I am trading on kraken and I am quite happy :)!

It is known that if you use your Amazon Prime account to order for someone else it will be shutdown. It is not allowed to share a prime account for non private use.

Have you tried to check out or trade more then 1000 € a month?  Then you need the same validation. At least when I registered there. I even had to fill out a Postident. Also Kraken and Bitcoin.de is basically the same. They both use Fidor.

"The numbers only have value because we believe they have value..." aaaaand that is where I stopped watching.
@_date: 2017-06-21 14:22:10
See my answer to FutureOfBitcoin. I guess I do not understand the term "value".
@_date: 2017-06-21 14:17:11
Perhaps I am! Bitcoin has a value for me because when I want to successfull mine bitcoin, I have to invest alot of value (money, computer power etc.). It has nothing to do with the fact that I believe in it.
After reading a bit -&gt;  I understand your point. Perhaps I do not understand the term value correctly.
