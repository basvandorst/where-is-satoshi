I stole some coins from myself.
Ok, this one need a long story. I had some coins from a long time, but secured by the bad practice of sharing a password with my google account. So one day i sent my bitcoin to a new address, secured private keys with a new password, backed up it online and forgot about it... Even forgot the password.
So I had a backed up file secured with an unknown password... From this time I was in the attacker role. I of course tryied every password I could remember and even bruteforced variants... nothing worked. I am pretty impressed by the power of crypto and reasured that storing a crypted file on untrusted servers is not a security hole. As all attacker should do, when I hit the armored door of my backed up file, I decided to go through the unintentionally open window. I dumped the raw data of the disk on which I generated the private keys... it was still there ready to be stollen.
Lessons to learn :
 * crypted files backuped are safe
 * the worst enemy is the loss of keys
 * always write down the rarely used passwords
 * always zero a disk before resseling it, valuable data can live long after being deleted
@_date: 2014-01-31 17:59:15
There is a case where the attacker compromise your blockchain account without the password : you logged in then leave your computer without lockscrean. Ok, a tech savvy attacker can retrieve your decrypted wallet, but your average coworker will certainly let it go when asked a password to steal you while you are at the restroom.
Stupid, purely opportunist attacks are the most common. Even if the "keys encrypted with secondary password" thing is false (I don't know about that), it still protect the user against his stupidity. Thats a good thing, I read somewhere that we all are complete fools about 5 minutes a day, nicely we can use 23h55 a day to protect us against that foolness.

OpenBSD is in my opinion, the most important OS for the security. It is based on researching, implementing and reviewing security innovations. As an example, it played a big part in the evolution of IPSec by providing the first open source implementation, researching how to use it securily at boot time and reviewing NSA writen drivers. Long to short, if you or your company can be confident using VPN connections, this is  due to these guys !

Some exchanges had  to stop business while only facing a tiny part of the problems MTGox suffered in its history. Exchanges will always have to deal with hazards of the two worlds they try to link. So MTGox appears to be rock solid, surviving such troubles is not easy.
Anyway distribution is good and I can only encourage peoples to choose carefully their exchange of choice instead of going blindly for "the leader". For those who want to compare here is some diferenciating properties : time to get cash in/out, fees (including bank fees) and trustworthiness of the exchange.

Send bitcoins to an instawallet, send a private message with the instawallet url and a public message notifying the tip ?
It could be nice to use the same instawallet adress per facebook profile (one wallet per tip is not convenient), but the instawallet key have to be pure random. If we accept to run a server for the service, it can remember the association between facebook profile and adress of the associated wallet. Registered users can change the adresse if they have a regular wallet. Problem : If the user delete the first private message with the instawallet key, the service is unable to resend the key and all subsequent tips are lost (until a custom bitcoin adress is registered).

You'll soon touch the borders of my knowledge, so I cannot go in depth about your last questions.
About the decentralization of the mining process, it is a recuring discussion topic in the bitcoin comunity and effectively p2pool seems to be an answer to that. P2pool is a decentralized pool where a node that finds a block share the reward with other miners so, I guess, there is no single point of faillure for a malicious attacker to take over the decision making. Once again I can not go in depth on that topic.
A concept about the security of the &gt;50% attack is that the miner that have &gt;50% have a great incentive to mine honestly and get his fair reward. The financial investment to get to this point is prety huge, so degrading the bitcoin network (and so on, the price) may be a terrible loss for the attacker. History shown that big pools operator are (currently) not evil and are prompt to find a fix when a problem arise, see v0.8.0 blockchain fork.
Anyway that kind of attacks happen some times on altcoins, especially a miner grabing all the mining rewards. So it may just be that bitcoin reached the critical mass of hashing power to being effectively secure.


You'r welcome ;)

Maybe I am the only one, but I agree with positions of the Bitcoin foundation, especially about this case. If Bitcoin is pseudonymous and free to use by design and philosophy it is not the case of fiat currencies. So transactions must be anonymous and free while in Bitcoin system. When interfacing with other systems (fiat currencies in this case) we have to respect others' ideas and follow their rules (bannishment of anonymity). It is a simple "respect you neightbour, he will respect you" idea.
I do not see the need to declare war to other money systems. If the lacks in fiat moneys bothers him too much, one should try to use Bitcoin more often instead of fighting problems with fiat. That is why Bitcoin is an alternative, we do not have to change the existing currencies (hard, need to fight, lead to revolution), but use the alternative to it (peacefull revolution).

To receive bitcoins, one need a bitcoin adress. To send bitcoin received to this adress, he needs the corresponding private key. So, a bitcoin client needs at least one bitcoin adress and its corresponding private key to be usefull.
Typiccaly, bitcoin wallets allow their user to generate multiple adresses. It helps anonymity since a user that uses multiple adresses is more difficult to spy watching the blockchain than someone using only one adress.
The initial idea to generate adresses/private key on demand was to effectively generate a random new adress each time the user ask for an adress. This is the way bitcoin-qt do it. One of the drawbacks of this method is that the wallet have to store all adresses/keys. So the user should backup it's wallet each time he generate a new adress in order to avoid loosing newly generated adresses/keys.
A BIP32 wallet will still allow the user to generate new adresses on demand but without the need to backup again and again the adresses/keys. The magic is that the second adress/key is not random but actually a derivative of the first one, the third is derived from the second,... All this is backed by some cryptography to ensure nobody can guess any of the adresses in the wallet without nowing the first private key.
Note : this explanation is largely simplified for you to get the big picture. It is not the most accurate ever. For a full description, re-read the wiki until you understand it :)

Actually I prefere the Irwin's article than the Krugman's one. Krugman essentially says that mining Bitcoin consume resources. It puts a lot of words to tell about a well known fact that was better described before.
Irwin's article takes time to establish some bases like an argumented definition of money before talking about what are he's problems with a Bitcoin economy. A far better read in my opinion.
Disclaimer : I am not well versed in economy nor I know general points of view of these two economists. That is maybe why I liked more the Irwin's article that explains more things from hypotesis to conclusions.

In such case Satan will be able to organise double spending, paying for a good then revert the payment to himself later. He can also force only it's own blocks to be validated, effectively taking all the profit from mining denying other miners income.
Note that for the double spending it seems to be a lot of organization, and for really expensive items the seller will often verify the identity of the buyer, putting Satan in the threat of lawsuits. And taking all bitcoins profit can damage buyers confidence in bitcoin security, damaging selling price, damaging the profit of Satan (compared to mine honestely with more that 50% of the network).

Nice, if I understood well, the script allow one to multiply locations where the association is done and reduce the single point of failure by checking official result.
It could be nice to also implement a web of trust using BTC key pairs. I would be able to send a signature with my address to the association between my friend name and it's address. So when you send me my friend address and tiers signatures, I will be sure it is not corrupted if my signature is here. If at least you signed with a publicly known adress of yours, I could be confident that a hacker could not have modified the record without access to your private key (partial trust).

The market of getting a transaction included in a block. This is a market where essentially transaction makers are buyers (and pay a fee) and miners are sellers (and redeem the fee).
It would basically work by watching what transactions are included pretty fast in a block and what are the associated fees. So an active node can determine the market price.

If the hash is done in the browser, it technically become the password. If the website store that hash, it actually store the password as a pirate that had a readonly access to the database is able to login as any user, sending the hased password directly instead of  letting his browser do the hash, and begin to do identity theft.
But while passwords are transmited plain text to the website, they are not transmitted insecurely if you use https for login. Using http for login is effectively a terribad idea.

Here is my humble opinion. I don't give a f**k at the market price and think that most bitcoiners don't.
I personally have two usages for bitcoin.
First, I have 30€ in an exchange. Whenever I need to pay something in bitcoin, i can nearly instantly convert € to BTC and send payment. Since most of the prices are labeled in fiat curreny, it make sense to store my wallet in fiat.
Second usage, more tied to the market. I cold store 1.6 BTC mined a long time ago. I have no real need for it, so i see it as a lotery ticket. The day it pay for my appartment credit, i'll cash out, in the mean time I am happy to have my little coins, even if they can be valued at zero one day.
The market price is driving discussions because it is crazy this times. Reddit and social networks are pretty well designed to show mainly fotm topics. When the price stabilise or user get accustomed to fluctuation, discussions will move to another topic.

This attack is not new and solutions exists for the website to mitigate it. I do not think it is sensible to think than everybody of your hundreds (thousands ?) userbase will follow your advices. Even if your advices are good ones, it is now public knowledge, if you do not enforce them you can expect the same percentage of badly protected accounts to exist tomorrow.
About the solution, I'll point [a good post from Guildwars2]( that suffered the same attack vector at the time of their release. The "email authentication" part is a very common measure, we can see it in Steam, WoW and other big brand services, this is still less intrusive than 2FA and protect peoples that do not use the compromised password for their email account. The "Password blacklisting" part is really clever because it is absolutely transparent for the carefull user but restrict new accounts from being created with known vulnerabilities.
Do you think of implementing some of this "not so intrusive" mitigation measures in the future ?
To let you on an ironic note : Please, every service, learn from these services' mistakes.

Yes there is a maximum that can exist, but they do not exist yet. The total number of bitcoin at any time is the sum of all addresses balance. When a miner generate a block, it add 25 btc to an address with a special transaction that have no source, effectively creating 25 btc.

It remembers me a not so old story about [fbi backdooring the ipsec code of openBSD]( From audit reports and analysis that followed we can understand that in crypto world the tiniest flaw in the code can weaken all the security, even if good practices are used.
In bitcoin case, if the random number generator (or it's entropy gathering primives) is flawed, your generated private keys will be "not so random". Considering that, even paper wallet generated without internet does not ensure your security. The best move to do is to generate your private keys on a well know open system and watch for security announcements... At least if you are paranoid ;)

It would be ideal to be able to verify that the shortname owner agreed. But I see no way for someone to give evidences of being the shortname owner. For that part we have to trust on the server distributing the short name or setup a distributed proof of work network verifying short names associations.
The system would be perfect if we can prove that both ways of the maping are legit. The worst (unhandled) is if the attacker change the address, but I also like to avoid to have somebody registering bad mouthing names to one of my public addresses.
I'll check how DNS is protected against domain theft, maybe there is something re-usable (long time since my last network lessons).

Litecoin is the largely discussed in this thread. I never really watched terracoin (suit wearing man in front pas and no link to a white paper is more than I can aford).
About PPcoin I have some concerns.
Proof of stakes make sense to simulate interests earning bank accounts. But, if I understood, there is still some hashing power to put in a   proof of stake block, depending on network difficulty and your stakes. So your interest earnings are not automatic, you have to have the computational resource to redeem it.
If it is nice to let your ppcoin in your wallet (working as beeing good stakes), it is bad for money circulation.
I saw the author talking about that, but I did not understood why it is not an issue : an attacker can let some coins in some wallets for some time. The attacker can then simply wait for the stakes allowing him to fork the chain of enougth blocks to double-spend with confirmations. This is due to a fundamental  diffsrence between proof of work and proof of stake. The cpu power of a miner is fixed, chances to find the next block rise over time but is reset each time a new block is published. Coinage grows over time and is never automaticaly reset.
Note: i am not a ppcoin expert, I'll appreciate all polite "you are wrong" answers.

Oh yes I forgot the denying possibility. Thanks for remembering it to me.
So, to be short he can deny any transaction but cannot steal bitcoin that he does not own.
To be long, he can become the only one in charge of creating blocks, and so on confirming transactions. So if he desire to deny a transaction for whatever reason, comming from sean's outpost or going to sean's outpost as examples, the transaction will be seen by the network but will never be confirmed.
The only way to continue to operate for sean's outpost in such condition is to stop relying on their public donation adress and give a new adress to any donator. The attacker as no way to say if a newly created adress is linked to sean's outpost.
Note, if the attacker really want to cause trouble he also can also deny absolutely all transactions, creating empty blocks. So there is practically no more confirmation mechanism in bitcoin transactions. Anyway, if an attacker control more than 50% of the network, confirmations means nothing.
Edit : forgot to answer about the "steal bitcoins from Sean's Outpost" part. It is impossible for the attacker since spending bitcoin is not related to the mining power. To spend bitcoin you have to use your private key to sign a transaction. Mining is the action of recording signed transaction in blocks, that is what we spend mining power on. So private key : spend bitcoins / Mining : confirm publicly good payments.

I read this recuring idea over the coments and I disagree. A considerable part of the Bitcoin comunity is constitued of cryptologists that are intrigued by Bitcoin not for paying a sandwich but because of it's claim to solve the double spend problem.
0-conf double spends have been heavily discussed among other double spends attacks, so proving it to be feasible is a great deal for a scientist minded person. Discussing a flaw in a new protocol is far more valuable than a sandwich for lot of Bitcoiners, and so it has been tried more than once.
Actually this thread intrigued me and I will certainly try more seriously to investigate 0-conf double spends than I have done in the past.

The per domain address is what i though in second idea, but instead of just one address we'll have a directory associating names to addresses.
Signatures can avoid an attacker being able to change the name attached to a specific address but he will be able to change the adress and re-sign, so your issues 1 and 2 are still problematic. Every body being able to easily setup it's own directory server is essential for being allowed to trust no one, that's why such a mechanisme must be standardized.
I'd prefer to be sure that a name can not be used for another address, but I see no solution for that except verification by peers and proof of work system.

The police may understand that you paid by internet without even talking about Bitcoin. And more, if he had done the same thing with cash it had leave you without anything, but with bitcoin you still have a transaction of the exact price at the exact time of the meeting publicly known (showable by blockexplorer and friends).
All that blabla to say that I think you are in a better legal position than if you paid with cash. Cameras do not help for evidences but, except at BigBrotherCity I doubt any police would request video records for a $80 dispute.

I created my account on an "old" smartphone (android 2.1). There is some rooms for improvment.
First I tried to use the default web browser, the virtual keyboard to type the PIN code was completely unusable, it poped under text fields. In such cases I use the Opera build for android 2.1, it was not the smoothiest experience ever seen, but I succeed to create my account. After that I did not succeed to create my user name, the link in the "overview" tab just poped an empty grey square in my screen.
I had to wait to have access to a desktop computer to create that user name : 
Talking about this link, Id love it to show a funding adress (with QR code), and so even to peoples not registered to inputs.io, this can be handy to accept payments from peoples that do not have (or want) to create an account.

About the volatility, like other comments I'll suggest using automatic "get paid in bitcoin, receive national currency" services. It supress the volatility concern on your side. But what seems to bother you is the volatility on consumer side, there is two things about that. First you can price your stuff in national currency, letting your payment provider determine bitcoin equivalent at the time of the transaction. Second, a bitcoin user is often somebody that already agreed with himself to accept that volatility, so it is he's choice, no problem with your game. The size of the bitcoin community can be an indicator of how much people are not affraid by this volatility.
About the enhancement of your sales, we will come back to the size of the bitcoin comunity. Do not expect to attract lots of new peoples to Bitcoin instantly by putting your game on the market, so you can estimate if the size of the comunity is worth marketing. Note that a great game anouncement more or less ensure you a front page post on this subreddit. Humble bundle even have a free front page post every now and then.
This was not in your direct questions, but there to convice you I'll also talk about a possibility granted by Bitcoin for your business. It is micro transactions, really tinny-micro-tinny transactions. With Bitcoins low fees you can accept payment for less than $1 easily and even less than $0.01 if you do accept bitcoins directly (no direct conversion to your currency). For business plans like item shops, it enable customers to pay for the specific item they want instead of offering payment for in game special money that can be spend in the item shop. Of course, you can still sell that special ingame money for other payments methods or for offering discounts the more the customer buy at once.

Other than any access to the data base, hashing the password client side (non salted) do not protect against very easy man in the middle attack. Scenario : At work the IT service runs a proxy that logs each http requests, a rogue IT staff member steal this log, he now have your hashed password that is all he needs to access your account. This attack is really easy to setup.
I did not understand your salting. You want the client to send "login + HASH(random_salt + password)" to identify ? How the server is able to identify the user having only previous HASH() results ? Or the server send the random salt as challenge to generate "HASH(salt + password)" ? In such case the server needs the pasword to check the result? Sorry if it is noob questions, web security is not my speciality.

Also, the fee is at the expense of the customer. You do not need to reflect it in your prices. When sending a payment the customer have to choose what to add as a fee, the higher is the fee, the speediest the transaction is processed.

It will be hard to generate an adress usable for scam but, once generated, it is easy to send the generated adress and pretend that it is the original one. Fooling peoples that do not carefully check the adress.

And there is way less dead links than on the wiki page. Plus a rating system.

It would make me think twice before buying something for less than 0.01 BTC, but I personally spent my bitcoins more than one time. In the worst cases, I choose to not set any fee, it take more time to validate but it works pretty well. That being said, I'll certainly feel required to add a fee at any brick and mortar location, for the sake of the owner's and my time.

Calling for upvote isn't prohibited ? Do you have an AutoModerate yourself function ?
