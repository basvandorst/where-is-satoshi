* Greece bought all the candy they could with their allowance. But they wanted more, so they asked their neighbor to buy them more candy if they give neighbor future allowance. Neighbor said OK, so Greece gets more candy.
* Greece never gives neighbor allowance, Greece keeps spending all of it on candy and eating all the candy. 
* Neighbor is mad, says "Gimme my money". Greece says "Nuh-uh, you're not being fair, you're trying to make fun of me". 
* Neighbor says, "You're making fun of yourself, I'm asking for my money". Greece says, "You're a meanie. I'll meet you on the playground in 9 days. One two three four five six seven eight NINE. Maybe I'll give it to you, maybe I won't."

If the concern about block size is preventing spam, then why don't we limit block size according to spam prevention rather than a relatively arbitrary number like 8 MB or 20 MB? Make the logic "block size cannot be more than 4 standard deviations above the past 4 weeks of block sizes". That logic scales indefinitely, with any rate of growth, no follow-up hard forks.

* Cash EUR may get forced into an unfavorable state mandated exchange rate for a new Greek currency, which I could avoid with BTC
* If I wanted to store my money in a safer currency, be it USD, GBP, or other, BTC is a vehicle that can get me there without having to secure physical dollars or pounds, unlike using the vehicle of EUR cash in Greece.

@_date: 2014-07-16 12:03:32
I agree with you. I'm having trouble estimating the end game.
* Fraudster has stolen credit card, buys from Amazon
* Some guy then receives the products
* BTC is released from escrow and sent to fraudster.
* Fraudster disputes the charge or Amazon finds the charge to be fraudulent
* Amazon mad, goes after fraudster. Fraudster's amazon account is a new one will all phony information. In usual card fraud, the shipping destination leads you to the fraudster, but in this case, that option is not available.
* Amazon keeps getting hit with fraudulent charges. Gets mad and starts noticing Purse.IO facilitating the abuse. 
* Amazon sues Purse.IO or government shuts down Purse.IO as a "fraud facilitator"?
* Honest guys' BTC locked in escrow get seized.

* During working hours.
* Wait in line.
* Fill out paperwork.
* Give all of my identifying information.
* Find that the associates do not understand IBAN/BIC numbers and they keep asking me "which one is the account number? This IBAN does not match my form field options", so I had to research it myself to break up the IBAN into (1) Country code (2) bank code (3) Account number (4) Check/control number.
* Call the main branch so that they could quote me an exchange rate and do the final processing.
* Quote me 3.01% over spot on the EUR/USD exchange rate.

* [BitFinEx]( = Only USD deposit options are international wire with a $20 min fee by BitFinEx and EgoPay, which has a 2% fee charged by BitFinEx.
* Bitstamp = international wire only
* BTC-E = international wire only
* [LakeBTC]( = No ACH, just wire transfers and EgoPay. [EgoPay charges the recipient]( 1.5% + 0.25 USD for each transfer, but [LakeBTC's fee structure]( indicates that USD deposit is free, so I'm not sure how that actually works without being a loss to them. 0.5% BTC withdrawal fee.
* OKCoin = [0.2% trade fee]( [Only USD deposit option]( is "Perfect Money", which has a 3.0% fee + the fee charged by "Perfect Money".
* itbit = 
* LocalBitcoins = Best for privacy, but big mark-up over spot rate.
* anxbtc = 
* hitbtc = 
* [CampBX]( = USPS Money Order and personal checks are accepted. No ACH. 0.55% trade fee.
* Bitquick = 
* Kraken = No USD deposit options are available.
* JustCoin = 
* Coinbase = Brokerage, not exchange. ACH deposits, instant BTC withdrawal if credit card on file as back-up, exchange rate locked in at time of buy so no waiting for the USD deposit before locking the exchange rate. By far the most convenient and the only sacrifice is privacy and fees. Fees are only about 0.4% cheaper if you use exchanges. Current fee is 1.0% + 0.15 USD.
* Circle = still invite-only, but with ACH deposits will likely be Coinbase's biggest competitor. "No fees", but there is a mark-up over spot. [Controversial public statements]( made by Circle's CEO.
* Coinsetter = [0.25% trade fee]( Their website says, "U.S. customers have the ability to make bank and bitcoin transfers to and from Coinsetter", but do not detail which kinds of bank transfers. That seems shady to me. Fortunately, [there is a wiki]( that clarifies, "Coinsetter accepts international SEPA and SWIFT wire transfers in USD."

* That insider trading didn't correct the vaulation before the good news became public
@_date: 2014-10-03 23:19:44


To be clear, the USD did not gather value because the US govt said "it's ok to use this to pay people", it gathered value because the US govt said "give me USD or I'll send people to your house to make you - resist and I'll shoot you. Oh, I almost forgot - declare all assets and income in USD too ... *bitch*." 
Govt could demand payment in chocolate zucchini bread and people would be baking all amounts of chocolate zucchini bread because they don't want to get shot and they can exchange it for goods and services from others who don't want to get shot.

My bet is that bitwage will not be necessary, you'll be able to direct deposit straight to Coinbase. You'll likely have the option to instantly convert x % into BTC and billpay will likely be able to pay in BTC or USD from a balance that is BTC or USD. So you could have 100% of your paycheck instantly converted from USD to BTC, then when rent is due, Coinbase will cut a check to your landlord in USD and when deposited, will withdraw the equivalent amount of BTC from your account.

GE: Simple - I keep it on a table so I can grab it at a moment's notice.
Me: But don't you ever have people over? Wouldn't you be worried that one of them might pick it up or do something stupid?
GE: I have people over all the time, but I don't invite untrusted people into my home.
Me: But how can you really know if one of your friends won't do something silly?

[Strict liability]( - strict liability is liability for which mens rea (Latin for "guilty mind") does not have to be proven in relation to one or more elements comprising the actus reus (Latin for "guilty act"). The liability is said to be strict because defendants will be convicted even though they were genuinely ignorant of one or more factors that made their acts or omissions criminal.
In many states, statutory rape is considered a strict liability offense. In these states, 22 as of 2007, it is possible to face felony charges despite not knowing the age of the other person, or even if the minor presented identification showing an age of eighteen or higher. Frequently, this applies to all sex offenses.

I'm not sure what "bitcoin represents", but financial security is always a plus. I recommend setting up a 2nd bank account for "less trust" purposes. Example:
* Main checking account = direct deposit paycheck from work + high trust groups (utilities, rent/mortgage, and credit cards)
* 2nd checking account = less trust groups (bitcoin, PayPal, anything that doesn't happen every month)

The only way to ensure your bitcoin don't get stolen over the internet is to never expose the private keys to the internet.

Agreed. The root question is whether to push the resource constraint of bitcoin mass adoption towards more expensive block processing or more expensive transaction fees. 
* Technology advancements will drive down the cost of processing larger blocks (bandwidth, storage, processing power).
* Fixed block size will never drive down the cost of transaction fees, only increase them with mass adoption.

Here are the ways to avoid artificial supply expansion:
* Take physical delivery
* Proof of reserves
With bitcoin, both are very easy, but not always utilized.
Outside of the options market with Coinsetter and BitFinEx, even the exchanges themselves could manipulate price with fractional reserve. Here's how it would work:
* Fill the open buy orders by telling the customers that they have purchased x units of bitcoin and make their account balance show this
* Expect that not all buyers will withdraw (take delivery) simultaneously
* (The amount of buyers at any given moment that have an account balance without withdrawing)*(average account balace of those buyers) = the amount of fake additional supply that can be generated

Greece has just 3 days left to find 750M EUR to meet the requirement of a principal payment to the IMF which is due next Tuesday.
The Greek government is now proposing to instate a tax on withdrawals from ATM’s in the country and aims to raise 180M EUR in additional fees due to this measure. Additionally, all wire transfers of in excess of 1,000 EUR will also be subject to the tax.
The controversial introduction of mandatory cashpoint charges still requires approval by the European Central Bank but is expected to amount to €1 for every €1,000 transaction.
A senior finance ministry official told The Times: 'The surcharge is just one of a grab-bag of measures we are considering if things get tough.'

And people say "there's all this supposed debt everywhere that can't be repaid. So don't repay it! Who does the debt even belong to?" If your money is in a bank, it's debt that belongs to YOU. As soon as you put in $10,000 the bank loans out $10,000 each to 5 people for mortgages, car loans, business loans, and other things you'd recognize. And if just one of those people default, your $10,000 is gone. So yes, let's not repay the debt ... let's make your bank account zero.

Very important. It's the difference between letting someone else store your gold coins and storing them yourself. When someone else stores your bitcoin, they could take it, they could get hacked and lose it, or the government could take it. When you hold the bitcoins, someone would have to have physical access to your house or wherever you store them. And if you lock them with a password, they'd have to beat you with a wrench to get it out of you. 
There's several options of varying conplexity and security for storing btcoins. The simplest way is to download "Breadwallet" on iOS or "Mycelium" on Android. These both work the same way, they'll give you a list of words to write down on paper and store in your home. Anyone with these words have your bitcoin, no password needed. Simple and easy. If you want a password lock, things get much more complicated. Start with the phone apps and you'll learn more about how storage works.

I offered $100 extra when making an international wire from USD to EUR because that *still* would have been a cost savings for me - but the recipient turned it down. My bank gives me no-fee wires, but I pay 1.00% on currency exchange, plus they put a spread on the exchange rates to make more money. And I have to drive to the bank during working hours, fill out paperwork, and instruct *them* on how to address the wire. The total markup was around 3.00%, which adds up fast when sending &gt; $5,000 (&gt; $150 markup), so I should have offered more. Bitcoin would have been zero fee and receiver would get to withdraw in Euros.

Armory had a significant update somewhere around v0.92 which rendered old wallet files incompatible. Download an old copy of armory, open it in offline mode, export private keys, then sweep them into a new wallet within the newest version of armory.

What if the market clearing price of the bitcoin network is 100,000 $/day, and it's only costing more than that because of the programmed block reward? Maybe fees don't need to increase for several years, until less than 100,000 $/day are earned from block rewards.

* LN doesn't exist
* Off chain transactions are much more centralized than large block nodes
* Sidechains have low security due to low hash rate. And people say large blocks squeeze out low-power nodes from the network ... if we're going to support X transactions per second, splitting those transactions into sidechains only increases node resource requirements even further. Total size of blocks to process is the same, but now you have the overhead of multiple software protocols running simultaneously rather than one.
Increase block size.

* change armory user mode to expert
* restart armory
* load cold wallet
* extract private keys. Start by clicking on "Wallet Properties", then "Backup this wallet", then "Export Key Lists".
* save private keys somewhere offline
* uninstall armory
* install newest stable armory
* create wallet (OFFLINE)
* Select "import/sweep keys"
* Try just one of your keys, to be sure. Ensure you use the "sweep" function, not the "import" option.
* Create watching-only copy of wallet
* Transfer watching wallet to online PC with newest stable Armory
* Load watching wallet, ensure balance shows expected amount from the one private key sweep
* If successful, go back to offline PC and sweep remaining keys (you should be able to do all at once)
* If unsuccessful, post here or on [bitcointalk.org's Armory forum]( which has a more active Armory community.
Armory is full-retard security, not for the masses. If Armory is too much for you, my suggestion is to use Breadwallet (iPhone) or Mycelium (Android), as they are the next best thing in security IMO.

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install bitcoin-qt
Then download armory at 
Check Armory's hash by:
    cd Downloads
    sha256sum armory_0.93_ubuntu-64bit.deb
Then compare that against the download. Then GPG verify the download by following the instructions [on the same page](
Let bitcoin core run overnight. Then the next day, install armory and let that run to build its databases. This new version of armory, like the new core version, syncs databases much faster than the old version. Let that run for an hour or overnight. Then you're ready to party.

The current size of the NSA is possible only through the indirect taxation of monetary supply expansion. So how does creating a financial system with fixed monetary supply work to their advantage? Even if they were able to data mine, the success of such a system would seal their demise. 
Unless you have a theory for how such power can be amassed in an age where monetary supply expansion is no longer a tool in the chest and the next greatest tool is used.
Or are you saying that there is a hidden bug that would unseat the supply limit? And that if bitcoin became too successful, they would pull that plug, which would harm bitcoin and cause a negative public perception of cryptocurrencies that would take time to overcome? 
Because even this would be merely buying time. But perhaps that's exactly what they need, as the government's collapse is inevitable due to unsustainable debts. So with bought time, they would be able to roll out the next tool from the chest.
