Yes I know it's old news... but I just installed the update 0.16.3 and I see the uBTC now displays as "bits".
I like it. Now I feel richer.

congrats, So you're a complaining idiot that bought BTC at the all time high , then sold it low. What are you trying to acheive? Make everyone think that BTC sucks? Just because you lost out? FAIL. These kind of posts are getting soooOOOOOO OLD. So tired of seeing this unfunny crap posts

If this is for total noobs then i’d also suggest using a peer to peer exchange like PayFair or Localbitcoins to buy some Bitcoin. PayFair has the advantage of no ID needed and is very safe to use.

First make as many copies of your .dat file as you can and store them on seperate external drives. Next, download bitcoin core. Install it. Let it download the entire Blockchain (might take a few days) then shut it down. Find the install directory which contains a file called wallet.dat - replace it with the .dat file you found. It must be called wallet.dat so rename it if necessary. Now start up bitcoin core again and voila- you got your 25 BTC. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 02:41:25
Like PayFair too

The headline is misleading . They are not offering crypto accounts - Monaco Card is a Swiss based company that DOES offer crypto balances and they are applying for a banking licence, but the bank mentioned in this article is not offering crypto accounts, they just say they are ok with other crypto businesses having accounts with them.
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:33:39
You can hold and spend too, they are not mutually exclusive 
@_date: 2018-06-16 05:43:42
The main point is that the government would never need to do that with a banking system using bitcoin, because it’s all 100% real money, not magic pretend ‘credit’ that the bank wizzed up out of thin air.

Yes they do. Mco Visa card for example let’s you send BTC too using the app that goes with it. To answer OP question- the point is you can spend your crypto more easily at any place that accepts visa. You can still store your crypto on your own private keys and just send what you want to spend to the card when you want to spend them, so you get the best.of both worlds - privacy, store of value of crypto and ease of spending of Visa.

Yes - finally someone said it. All this 'blockchain' talk, I believe is a conspiracy to try to detract from Bitcoin.
