I have been a Bitcoin hobbyist for about 2 years and with a variety of different means (small investment, day trading, mining) I generated a sizable amount, now if I have to pay taxes on this, that is not a major concern for me, however I worry if I go to withdraw via any method banks would flag the money and not give it to me. The currency is all completely legitimately gained , but I have no proof of this. Does anyone have suggestions on how one would withdraw, or prove legitimacy without risking a bank freeze?

Who is Hamilton in relation to BCH ? Isn't Roger the big BCH dude ? Or is this Hamilton someone unrelated to crypto ?

Oh , thank you for the info, I tried googling the name but all that came up was a musical. I don't know why I got the hate though, I'm Canadian can't blame me for not knowing the founding fathers of America....
Edit: assumed he was BCH related cause I thought that was BCH simble behind him
