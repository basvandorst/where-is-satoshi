I'd love to see the community donate anough BTC to get a high profile person (who genuinely believes in bitcoin) to do a basic educational spot on what bitcoin is, how it works, and why its good for the world. I know very good descriptions like this exist, but if reiterated by a celebrity, I think we could reach a much wider audience.

I agree. 
The good news is that even if he does become a meme in this subreddit (he already has) it's not likely that it's a fad that will last, so he's got that going for him, which is nice.
Poor guy. 
At least he got a free lunch today.

Hey everybody! 
Remember 16 hours ago when we were all freaking about finding Satoshi and was all like "There's no proof in the newsweek article, you fat fucking donkeys" and then some of us were all like "Look at this awesome new meme where Satoshi gets goxed with a samurai sword!!!!" ???? 
Dat level headed OP.
