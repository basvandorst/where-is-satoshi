It seems like we are all required to log in and give some more information now.

Right around $6000.

I have been a happy Coinbase customer since their inception. There have been a few ups and downs but nothing crazy. They did not require any id when I signed up but did want to know the standard information about me. I recently wanted to see what Circle was all about and give myself another option so I signed up, added my bank account and had it verified. No problem until I tried to buy $10 worth of bitcoins. My purchase was denied and they wanted to see my id. At first I felt like they didn't trust me even though I gave them 100% accurate information and lots of it. Not a good way to start a relationship. Once I got over it I sent them my id and I have recently tried the $10 purchase again. Still no bitcoins but I am hopeful. If I have any more trouble I am giving up on them. They are making it too hard to buy bitcoins and are making me feel like I am doing something illegal buying them.

Denied on my second attempt even after sending my photo license. Guess I am a bad dude. Time to cancel this account, I'm sure that will go just as smooth.

They should call it CircleJerk. What a joke it is to create an account. Circle is awful.
@_date: 2015-01-12 00:34:09
Is Trucoin.com an option?

Fuck paypal

I am on my way. I heard Spain was nice.
I've never had any problems purchasing bitcoins. I am always looking for multiple ways to do it.

It is only going to get worse with the Circle converts adding to the fun.

When you reach fifty you will be glad you are fifty. It is a great age to be. Plus, I got to see the world before and after the computers and that is very cool.
Some of us old coots love cryptocurrency and the whole idea of it. It has served me well.
@_date: 2019-12-09 16:10:50
Interesting way to look at it.
@_date: 2018-11-26 19:14:43
Thank you, kind sir.

Circle is awful.

Coinbase lover...but not employee. Circle treated me like a low-life scumbag and they had no reason to. I hope they go under and take all your coins with them.
@_date: 2015-03-17 13:01:04
Circle sucks...I don't need to read anything else about them.
@_date: 2015-03-16 17:47:43
Don't expect anything better at Circle.
@_date: 2015-03-17 19:02:46
get a life

You can make Coinbase instant purchases by adding a credit card as backup and proving you are who you say you are.

Circle sucks

Bitcoin dies on darkmarkets = bitcoin dies

Coinbase rocks...
@_date: 2015-03-23 19:46:15
Doesn't surprise me. Awful company.
@_date: 2015-03-09 12:51:01
Circle sucks
@_date: 2017-05-03 17:24:40
I would like to invoke Fight Club rules. If we don't talk about it maybe it will go away.
@_date: 2015-03-19 01:03:12
Circle is awful.

Coinbase has been flawless for me. I appreciate the ease at which I can buy and use bitcoins. I hope to continue a mutually beneficial relationship for a long time. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:46:53
I keep mine on Coinbase. If I had a bunch of them I would probably consider something else. I don't have complete faith in Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:34:50
umm...yeah....I accidentally sent them to you. Please return them as quick as you can. I will forward the address. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:34:25
Sorry to hear about your troubles.  I think your post will help a bunch of people. Thanks.
@_date: 2015-02-18 14:03:27
Thank you...thank you...thank you. I had very similar experience with Circle but I gave up. I have been using Coinbase successfully for a long time but I wanted to have a back-up account somewhere else. When I feel like getting abused again I'll give it another try.
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:55:42
I'm also surprised that there is no competition. I keep reading about some Bitinstant type services starting up but I haven't seen anything solid lately. If all you want to do is purchase bitcoins and then spend them those types of services are almost as convenient as Coinbase.
Coinbase has been nothing but good to me so far so I haven't missed the competition.
@_date: 2013-10-21 18:51:26
I'd agree. I haven't experienced one hiccup yet and I have been a customer for quite some time. They have been requiring more (credit card, billing address) to stay instant. I don't think they could ask for anything more! As long as the service continues at the level it is at and I can get instant coins I will be a faithful customer. I like Coinbase a lot.
@_date: 2013-10-21 18:35:28
I would use an ipad app to access my Coinbase account.
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:39:57
I purchased coins this morning no problem. I did get the message last night stating they had hit their buy limits.
@_date: 2013-11-02 18:27:21
amen...I couldn't agree more. I have been a satisfied and happy customer for some time now. I have never once had to contact customer service.
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:35:07
Any celebrity talking about Bitcoin is a good thing.
