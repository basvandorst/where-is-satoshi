Every machine ISN'T mining their "own" satoshis though.
21 has set up a mining pool, and each ASIC contributes to that pool.  The chances of any miner in the pool EVER mining a single winning block is pretty much zero.

I live in Australia so this isn't a website in another country.  You simply go to your bank and deposit cash into an account, leaving an id as the reference, and very quickly after the bitcoin gets sent.
It's the same process as the ATM you're talking about uses.

My problem with bitcoin ATMs is that you had to trust the issuer of the "coins" not to keep all of the private keys somewhere.  
It would be stupidly easy to do the following, all but one step is how you'd actually set up your own bitcoin ATM:
-get some bitcoins
-transfer them in in .1BTC increments into seperate offline wallets
-print the address and key onto a neat coin looking thing, the private key has a scratchoff style thing
-***keep a record of all of those private keys!!!!!
-Allow people to use your ATM to withdraw .1 bitcion coins (whether you act as a fiat exchange or they transfer in coins doesn't matter)
-wait 1 year
-***transfer all the bitcions you issued back into your own wallet
A few people will have transferred their bitcoins, but the majority have bought them to hold on to them (or to hand them to someone else), and so you'll basically have doubled your holdings.  
There's no way to stop this sort of attack if you're trusing someone else to generate a cold wallet for you.

@_date: 2014-02-25 09:35:33
If you're spending directly, and not converting back to fiat, why did you have it at mtgox instead of your own wallet?
You're saying you wanted to avoid the whole centralized banking idea, but you put your bitcoin into a centralized "bank"!

Where do new bitcoins come from?  Every single one has come from a miner.
Any miner who has successfully mined a single block is a bitcoin user.
@_date: 2016-06-26 01:28:24
That's the issuance schedule, which creates new bitcoins. This is talking about a fee market for confirmation, which is an eventual "good thing," as the goal is to have fees pay miners.

"total fiscal supply"?
"Summed circulation"?
A market cap implies it is the perceived total value if you had to acquire something. You cannot"acquire" bitcoin, and it's value is not constrained by "total bitcoin *current price".
@_date: 2016-06-20 09:50:03
A market cap is, in short, what you could buy 100% of a company for. 
If you bought every bitcoin in existence, what would that get you as far as corporate control of "bitcoin"?  Would you be entitled to all future profits and production of bitcoin?
There is no USD market cap (if you think bitcoin is a currency) nor gold market cap (if you think it is a commodity).
Anyone mentioning a market cap for bitcoin should be ignored as they have no idea what they're talking about.
@_date: 2016-06-20 09:41:25
Merchant agreements offer security, and I doubt they allow offline approval over $100 or so

It's nothing about block height, it's about UTC timestamp.  
"This BIP will be deployed by "version bits" BIP9 with the name "segwit" and using bit 1.
For Bitcoin mainnet, the BIP9 starttime will be midnight 15 november 2016 UTC (Epoch timestamp 1479168000) and BIP9 timeout will be midnight 15 november 2017 UTC (Epoch timestamp 1510704000)."
So if you read BIP9, you're not signalling for segwit in advance.  You're signalling for a random non-bip softfork "thing".  
Create a BIP for "signalling I will vote for segwit" which uses the same bits as segwit and has starttime 10 Nov end time 15 Nov and publish it for draft if that's what you want to do.....  Then at least your intention is "technically" clear.

There are other ETF's around.  Have all of them seen 15000% growth since being listed?  If not, why do you assume 150000% growth for bitcoin simply by being listed on an ETF?
@_date: 2016-10-17 23:14:26
We will have to agree to disagree. 
As far back as 2012 (when I got "into" bitcoin) there was a huge push to encourage retailers to accept Bitcoin due to low fees, hence people needing a good way to trust single or even zero conf transactions. This culminated into a "win" when overstock.com began accepting them in 2013, and the eventual creation of coinbase.
For quite a while every nontechnical post on here was about how many millions or billions Walmart/best buy/etc could save by moving to bitcoin, or how someone convinced their local coffee shop to accept Bitcoin with the allure of lower fees.
Even changetip relies on low fees, or it becomes worthless...
@_date: 2016-10-12 04:38:50
Why didn't you trade in other markets before bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-10-14 00:03:49

Yes, but buying stuff you want to use day by day is also avoided (at this point in time) with bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-17 03:07:01
Why do you say that is not a goal of bitcoin?  Who sets these "goals" ?
For the past few years EVERY discussion about how bitcoin is "the future" is around coffee shops/etc using it to beat credit card fees, and how it's cheaper than western union for sending money "back home" for immigrants.
The only time this hasn't been stated as one of the huge goals has been the last few months during the block size arguments.
@_date: 2015-10-18 22:48:15
"The whole process took about 5 minutes which I believe is a normal amount of time for a fiat ATM as well."
This is not true at all.  Typical ATM time for me is well under 1 minute, and if I'm at my own bank's ATM, which has "quick/saved transactions," it can be under 30 seconds.
This is in Australia.  When I lived in the USA (up until 2003) I don't remember it taking any more than about 1-2 minutes max, and usually that was waiting on the modem most ATMs had at the time.  I'd guess USA ATMs are just as quick as Aussie now.  
They all have a 3g/4g card and a little antenna on top, meaning they always have a data connection.
@_date: 2016-10-12 06:01:00
So then specifically bitcoin didn't change your life, getting lucky on speculation did...
@_date: 2015-10-19 23:02:32
Now for my bad analogy.  This will be about "postcoin", which is just like bitcoin but in the physical world.
Think of it like a bunch of postbox lockers with combinations.  like this: 
Every box has 2 things, an address (box 15) and a combination (1 left, 15 right, 22 left....).
Anyone who knows your box number can put things into the box.  If this is a "postcoin" postbox, essentially all that can be put into the box is an IOU.  I write an IOU for 1 postcoin and put it in your postbox.  You can prove to ANYONE that I owe you 1 postcoin simply by opening your locker with the combination!
Now say that to keep it secure, the combination is 12 numbers long, way longer than you'd remember off the top of your head.  So, you have the combination written on your laptop, and you picked those numbers by some scheme.  Lets say that you have your favourite book, and you picked the combination by choosing the first page number that 12 words appear on.  You remember those 12 words, or even write them down, but you don't write down the name of the book.
You eventually lose your laptop, and thus lose the combination.  You buy a new laptop, and now to "regenerate" the combination all you have to do is find the book and remember your 12 words.  Using those words you can recreate the complex combination that you'd never otherwise remember.  
NOW you can prove again that I gave you an IOU for 1 postcoin.  You haven't taken the IOU out of the box and home, you haven't gotten me to rewrite it, you just had a way to recreate the proof that you hold the IOU I gave you.
This is WAY simplified, and doesn't deal with how YOU prove the IOU came from me, but hopefully explains how and why the recovery process works.  You're not recovering the coins, you're recovering the proof that you own the box that coins were put into.

Who is "they"?
The fund manager?
Why/how would they already have enough bitcoins to back a reasonable investment vehicle?
@_date: 2015-10-19 22:48:30
The thing that can be hard to get your head around with BitCoin is that your "coins" aren't in the wallet, nor stored on your HD.
What is stored in the wallet is essentially the "proof" that you "own" the addresses that other people sent transactions to.  
That's why it's recoverable with the passphrase; it isn't downloading the "coins" again or anything like that, it's using that phrase to regenerate the same private key (what I called the "proof").
In a seperate reply I'll give a (bad) analogy, in case that gets voted down for being too contrived :)
@_date: 2013-11-12 21:47:22
From here:   it seems that 2 years ago the entire blockchain was 500+mb already.
So this means that, until this is solved, there's no real way to do bitcoin on a mobile phone (most countries have limited data) apart from doing your initial download on wifi?  And that I'm going to be using a full gigabyte of my phones storage just to be able to spend BTC?
Continuing on, I guess this is why those bitcoin "banks" are popular?  I'd always wondered why the hell you'd ever use them...

Your 4th comment is a symptom os the USA (I'm guessing that's where you are, you don't say?) banking system.
Here in Australia you can easily send up to 10k to anyone with an aussie bank account via phone (internet or call), and even more if you have a 2 factor authentication dongle.
And at no cost.
