Uh no, I just meant it could have been constant as opposed to decreasing. How on earth could I be interpreted as meaning anything else?

I hear this a lot, but why in the world would it make the collection of taxes impossible? Cash transactions are taxable, and sufficiently large cash transactions really are taxed because someone reports them to the IRS.

I don't see why they would. Bitcoins are irrecoverably lost all the time, and the supply would eventually reach an equilibrium where the loss rate would precisely balance the rate of generation (about 7,200 BTC/day). E.g. if every day 0.01% of all bitcoins are lost, the supply would stabilize at 72,000,000 bitcoins.

I don't think the gradually decreasing mining reward was necessary or even useful. Economies generally grow exponentially; if Bitcoin were doing so badly that its growth was sub-linear, it would have bigger problems than price increases.

I did some back-of-the-envelope calculations and figured out that, if Bitcoin continues deflating only 1/6 as quickly as it has so far, within less than two years or I'll be able to live on capital appreciation alone. I can't wait to see how this fails to happen.

You're not expected to destroy a bitbill as soon as you get it, you're expected to trade it; you'd probably only destroy it if you don't trust the guy who gave it to you. Even if you needed digital bitcoins, it would be just as easy to trade the card for them with your neighbor or something.
On net, Bitbills are probably about as environmentally friendly as cash. Downside: made of plastic instead of paper, so somewhat more harmful per card; upside: more durable than cash, so they may circulate far longer.

I'll go a step further and assume you have no interest in doing anything illegal.
Bitcoin is like cash that can be sent through the internet. You can send or receive bitcoins to or from anywhere in the world, without giving out any personal information or waiting for the banks to open.
Remember that Epsilon credit card breach? That can't happen with Bitcoin, because everyone stores their own bitcoin wallet instead of having a single server do it. Maybe a hacker can steal from someone, but he can't steal from everyone.
You've probably run afoul of the games banks play to try and trip you up and charge you extra fees, but you can't avoid it because sending cash in the mail for everything is just too slow and theft-prone. With Bitcoin you can send payments across the world in a matter of minutes to hours,
without having to deal with those guys.
With Bitcoin it's a lot easier to maintain your personal privacy. Do you really like it when Visa sells information about how often you eat out or how much gas you use? If anyone is selling that information it should be you. Bitcoin can make it harder to link multiple purchases and sales to one source. You can make your life as private or as public as you want.
Bitcoin makes international trade easier. Forget the whole "fair trade" scheme---you can buy your coffee beans directly from a farmer in Costa Rica, and pay him twice what he would make otherwise while still saving money. Now [i]that's[/i] a fair trade.

1. It's not that huge right now.
2. It should be technically possible to 'prune' the blockchain by replacing the first million blocks or so with a list of address balances, though I don't know that anyone is working on this.
3. As more people use services like MyBitcoin, fewer transactions will involve the actual blockchain.

There's very little available to buy that I'm interested in, at the moment. But then I don't buy all that much stuff to begin with.
If I could pay my bills with bitcoins I'd be all over that.
@_date: 2011-05-10 17:32:18
Well, you'd certainly spend bitcoins if they were the only or the easiest way to get something you wanted. This isn't often the case right now, but eventually it could be the case somewhere (Silk Road seems like a likely candidate in this regard).
And you'd probably spend them if you thought the current market valuation was about right. Most people would agree that the long-term probability of success for bitcoin is slim at best---let's say 0.5%. Most people would also agree that, if Bitcoin were widely adopted, one bitcoin would easily be worth $1000. If you believe both of these things, you should be willing to sell a bitcoin for $5 or more right now, or trade it for goods/services if you would spend $5 on them.
And you just might spend them if you were low on cash. As a result of the rising exchange rate, I now have more of my assets in bitcoins than in cash. If I suddenly had to drop a lot of money on something, I might use credit, but I hate taking on debt if I can help it---I've been burned once already. Once the bill came in I might just dip into my bitcoins.

No, I think the password is better. It's two-factor authentication: the wallet is something you have, and the password is something you know. You're proposing to lock up the key, which still means having a key for the key.

Yoh realize that businesses selling their bitcoins are selling them *to* someone, right? They aren't just vanishing and being replaced with local currency. If you want to trade your dollars for bitcoins, you have to find someone willing to trade their bitcoins for dollars.

I seriously doubt that your password went uncracked. More likely it was in an earlier release.

There are a lot of solutions to this problem, many of which are already being worked on.
As others pointed out, clearing houses can handle a lot of the traffic. I disagree that this is contrary to the purpose of Bitcoin, because (1) Bitcoin is a network protocol, not an agenda, and (2) at any rate the use of these clearing houses would be genuinely voluntary since it's no hassle for merchants to accept "cash". A clearing house organized with the purpose in mind could easily make transactions more anonymous, by holding multiple users' funds at the same address.
Another solution is what on the forums has been called a "thin client"---a program that downloads only what it needs to keep track of its own accounts, and uploads only transactions that it originates. Checking every ten minutes to see if someone sent you money doesn't sound too unsustainable to me.
Running a full node---yeah, that may become harder. I guess the question is whether it will become harder faster than desktop computers become more powerful. It isn't obvious to me which way this will go.

The easiest way is probably just to go to the Marketplace forum at  and make an offer. That's how I made my first buy. Be sure to specify how you'll be paying (my bank does free ACH push so I went with that).

Horrible. We'd better stick to paper money and metal coins instead.

Indeed this is a problem. I'm storing an encrypted copy of my wallet in Dropbox to protect against this, but this relatively simple solution is still a too elaborate for old Aunt Tillie, who doesn't know where her wallet is stored and has never heard of GPG.
Eventually one of the following will probably happen:
1. People will have so much of their wealth in bitcoins that they will actually decide it's worth their while to learn data security. This is already happening to some extent, but given how people choose their online banking passwords right now, I wouldn't hold my breath.
2. People will keep most of their bitcoins in "banks" that make it their business to understand security. Not everyone, of course---some people won't trust banks, but they'll be making a conscious decision to take responsibility for their own security.
3. Improvements to the client software will make strong encryption and offsite backup dead simple. This would be the best solution of all, and it seems quite likely to happen within the year or so.

It was almost certain that something like the MtGox fiasco would happen eventually. So it kind of makes sense that it was already priced in.

It's slightly less far off now than it was yesterday, because it's actually possible. Anyone interested in advocating for Bitcoin now has a great ice-breaker on hand. I particularly like the idea of tipping with them (as long as it's not a replacement for a USD tip for your waitress or something).

Given that this presumably wasn't intended to mean what it says, perhaps the owner should be contacted and asked to alter this clause. I might bring it up on the forum if someone else doesn't do so first.

Definitely pooled. Solo mining is just too risky, especially where your window is so small---it's likely you'll be unprofitable within two months. And it's within the realm of plausibility that you will generate absolutely no blocks in that time, if you go solo.
Of course it's also possible you'll generate twice as many blocks as expected. But if you're looking to gamble, why not just buy the bitcoins outright?
@_date: 2011-05-09 04:54:08
Well... I bought a new video card partially for mining. I spent a lot less than many people on the forums---$500 total on hardware---so turning a profit was pretty easy. And if I could do it again, I wouldn't have bothered. Had I just bought $500 worth of bitcoins at that time, I would have done far better. So mining may not be the free-money extravaganza you think it is.
At the same time, these "rich" became rich by contributing to a project that had little chance of succeeding even to the extent that it already has, and is far from finished with the "not dying" phase of its growth. From this perspective they're best looked at as VCs of a sort. They've taken an unlikely chance of making a huge profit, and so far it seems they've gotten lucky.
And you must admit that some of it is luck, or else it was obvious from the get-go that miners would make obscene profits... and then why weren't you doing it?
@_date: 2011-05-09 04:55:26
It's still the start. If you're worried about miners becoming ultrarich, you could hedge against it by being one.
