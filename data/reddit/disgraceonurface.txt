You can hook a credit card up to coinbase and immediately have $100 spending limit per week, which is much quicker and more convenient than most exchanges.

It can be one of the better ones, especially if you nab something on sale.  Check out r/buildapc, maybe post there to double check if the pre-made you are selecting is a good value.  I'd really avoid giving Best Buy any money if it's possible, many of their products are shit quality and/or overpriced.
If you get brave and want to build your own (it's really just like putting legos together, I swear), you can check out  for a comprehensive list of most Canadian PC part vendors.  r/buildapc can also help you out with the building process.  Probably worth noting that the next generation of graphics cards is coming out reasonably soon, so if you time it correctly, you'll be able to find great deals on the 10xx series for NVIDIA.

sounds like you should either do a little more research, or just use nicehash.  if you're 'mining' btc on a pc with a gpu, you're already doing something incorrectly - you want to mine alts and convert to btc if you're dead-set on btc.  try joining a mining pool if you're interested.

Sorry, I wasn't clear about what I would have bet on.  This news is something new because paying with bitcoin was disabled for about a year.  I'm aware it was an option before.
