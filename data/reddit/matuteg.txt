It’s just scary to think that the company itself could be “saving” a carbon copy. You know? I understand if it’s done locally so you don’t have to recover it every time you open the app. 
Thanks for the info :)

And how do they generate them? They work backwards from private key to public key?
How do I know that Trezor, breadwallet (insert any wallet generator) doesn’t keep a copy of the private and public key once they are created?

I am an international student. Was able with no issues. For how long have you had your SSN? It takes a few months to start showing as valid in many places. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:23:21
12,000 on Gdax. Also jumped $50 bucks afterwards!

If bitcoin is here to stay, can you imagine bitcoin maybe refreshing old addresses  that have no transactions in over a determined amount of time, to be recycled after certain amount of blocks. (Like 100 years worth of blocks) and get those stucked coins back to miners. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:19:25
Not really. Just make sure that you call your bank, give them your SSN. Add it to your profile on your bank account, credit card, cell phone. Make it be out there. 
Download credit karma, whenever credit karma allows you to check your credit score with your SSN, then it will work in Coinbase. 
But you shouldn’t have any issues for low fees purchases.

Its on the email
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:19:54
Not centralized, but it can be changed and have support by miners. Like a soft fork or something. Like segwit. Idk

I mean, I was thinking of just creating a few wallets, gather the recovery words, fill them up, give the words to them and the name of the App to check on it. I want them to be excited about looking at their coins on their phones rather than a paper that for them may have no value.  
Thank you for your response!
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:55:29
Would you just go to any other “wallet provider” and put those 12 words?
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:49:25
I’m using MacOS. Just reminding people out there to double check!
@_date: 2017-08-24 00:34:14
Just played. You never know. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:55:34
I win ��

ELI5, if we lower to 500kb, won’t the same transactions still weigh the same, requiring more blocks, hence same amount of storage as before but with double the blocks? And wouldn’t that take longer?
@_date: 2017-08-26 02:02:15
[Thank you](

1BTC= $4203.66 at the time this happened. Let’s see what happens from here!
@_date: 2017-08-24 06:14:27
I wish 
@_date: 2017-08-26 01:56:19
Is this how Coinbase works? By just changing the address all the time?
@_date: 2017-08-23 05:34:24
Wonder how it will deal with the fees. $.75 added $3 charged in fees. 
It’s a great idea. Hopefully it becomes widely available and with minimal fees. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:21:32
Second this. I would love some internet brownie points lol 
@_date: 2017-08-26 01:38:48
How does Coinbase for example avoid the delays? Every time I use Coinbase for bitcoin transfer, I don’t have to wait 10 min. Anyone knows?
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:12:41
@_date: 2017-08-26 02:00:34
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:37:17
Bitcoin, SegWit, blockchain, or all three?
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:41:19
RemindMe! 4 days
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:42:11
I wish! In all seriousness, do you think by 2100 will it be worth that much? 
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:47:59
I would not like that!
@_date: 2017-08-26 01:59:48
Help me pay college please ❤️ 
@_date: 2017-08-28 04:55:27
Well. Not there yet!
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:06:35
Thanks! 
Yeah, I’m just asking from the college student perspective that would make less than 1K from it ��
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:33:23
You can still get in bitcoin without Coinbase. Coinbase is just one “3rd party” company that simplifies everything

You don’t use FL025. Its 2500 ft. You use FL once you cross FL180
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:26:32
Good luck getting your PPL!
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:04:11
And I disagree. I am a CPL. in the United States the TA is 18,000. The first FL is FL180. Unless you are referring to some other country. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:04:13
But I’m pretty sure there may be a threshold where the IRS actually wants you to report it. I don’t think if you make $20 vs $5000 they would care. Right?
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:19:32
I used the American rules because that aircraft was flying in the NAS because of the airport identifiers with K. 
And sorry for sounding combative. It’s the internet and you said you disagreed. �� Automatic response. Fly safe
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:16:45
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:54:16
That’s what we discussed above. Read the other comments lol 
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:09:37
Well. Best to start with What country is it before you say that what I stated before is incorrect. 
Based on the NAS (National Airspace System Im the USA) FL180 to FL600 is class A, after FL600 is class E. 
In the US, FL180 is when we switch to 29.92. That’s why the first flight level is FL180

Yeah I should’ve mentioned the fact that my income is Null and all I just bought bitcoin with savings I had. My taxes last year were $16.10. Was wondering so I don’t get in trouble at 22yold 
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:31:04
I didn’t post about it until I actually saw the 8!
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:49:39
Wouldn’t D be long term?
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:59:15
And it asks for each line. Do I write each line or one big with totals and leave dates blank?
@_date: 2017-09-18 16:39:22
It bugs me that they didn’t do it 7000000 or 6930000 or 6969696
