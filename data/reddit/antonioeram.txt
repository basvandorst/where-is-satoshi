another update. 
It seems there are some issues on Android when showing the content of the wallet. Using IOS app I am getting a number (the correct one) and on Android an older one (how in the hell is this possible). 
Another Android bug is that I still don't get the transactions history for a subwallet. 
Pretty anoying. CoolBitX please fix this asap. 
p.s. I am running the latest Android and iOS versions.

Ok, here is a short description and review of CoolWallet for Bitcoin from CoolBitX. 
Despite the fact that I had to receive three (3) devices, one replacing the other one, now I am satisfied with the final version. Apparently, at the moment I am writing this review, the battery issue was corrected. I received the device three weeks ago, and it is still at 50% battery (and I am checking once a day at least).
 I have never recharge it so far. Once I do it, I will post an update.
This is the package :
with the charger [Imgur]( that uses some proprietary technology (It does not work with wireless charger from Samsung at least)
First run, with the card asking to install and run the app [Imgur]( . 
After that, every time you connect the app you need to select the wallet to connect with. [Imgur](
The developer tells that you can connect as many cards you want with the possibility to rename each card for identification. 
The device is very well designed and is not thicker than a credit card. Pretty amazing considering everything that is encapsulated inside 
_ screen: e-paper ( not visible in the dark but this is ok), with an excellent resolution for what is suppose to do.
_ Battery: rechargeable with probably 6 - 8 weeks reserve
_ NFC chip
_ Bluetooth: for secure communication 
_ a button: for start / switch between wallets (up to 5 per card) / confirmation 
_ chip/secure element : for encryption 
The software works with Android and iPhone. Since I own an Android phone (Galaxy Note 7) I will review this version OCT 2016). 
At this moment I firmly believe the software is half baked. Why ? because every time I try to make a payment from the wallet the app crashes with a strange message first ([Imgur]( . Hopefully, It will be fixed with a software update. 
Receiving is ok, or partially ok (since there is another bug that somehow loses the transaction history)
For example here is one of the wallets yesterday [Imgur]( and here is what is shows today [Imgur]( (nada). 
As I have mentioned, you can create up to 5 wallets. The appear in the app and on the card as well (here you use the button to switch between them) [Imgur]( In the app, when switching the wallets, you can see the action on the card as well. 
The issue here is a very long time to switch between the wallets in the app (about 15 seconds) 
Once entered the app you have a menu button on the top left [Imgur]( with the following functions :
_ host devices [Imgur](
where you can pair the card with multiple devices. In order NOT to lose the bitcoins inside you need to have kept the primary device handy before you pair with another one (I guess if you lose the device you are out of luck ... or not) . A device can be deleted at anytime
_ cool wallet card [Imgur](
where you can name the device 
_ security [Imgur](
various security functions and policy 
_ settings [Imgur](
pretty useless now since it only shows the exchange rates (I cannot identify the exchange for rate)
- logout 
For each wallet, you can generate a receiving address [Imgur]( or you can send BTC [Imgur]( Unfortunately, as I have mentioned the SEND is NOT working !!!
For each transaction you can get the details [Imgur]( 
That's kind of all.

I wonder what are the "more complex ideas" ....
If the blockchain was not complex enough...

Let's say he will register the whitepaper on his name.... what could be the consequences?
