At a cost to yourself?
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:46:01
It would cost you 95% of your investment.

Ok, then it would cost 95% of what he could have cashed out. Either way it's baghodling.

Well, my question to you is: is it those people who demand charity that make America a country you want to live in? Is it to them that you owe your dues because you picked this place?
I think to answer this question honestly is to become a libertarian.

Do you actually believe this?

I hope you all remember that the higher the adoption by wall st. the more impossible it will be for ordinary people to transact on a 1mb block. BTC will have become hodler and day trader material.

SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL dude do not wait for the next crash. God knows how long it will take to recover, do you really want to gamble with such an opportunity?

Do you think one can sell that many bitcoins today all at once? Would that even be possible?
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:26:30
How high do you think it will go?

I'm getting a whiff of The Big Short over here. Are we in a bubble?
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:19:32
yeah how tf is that even possible? I guess some girl memorized 67k pi digits, but she was chinese!

Nope. It's an old meme with a huge, intricate backstory behind it that I don't have the time to get into right now. You have to read the original white paper and have a very high IQ to understand Hodl.

I'd say trusted relative or bitcoin ATM. He's in the US so he shouldn't have *too* much trouble finding one.

I can imagine that this sort of thing really puts your self-worth to the test, doesn't it? It's like, are you more than your money? Do you have the inner strength and resourcefulness to know that you can still get somewhere in the world without the huge amount of money you lost? I'm sure many people would have killed themselves over this kind of thing.

Might buy you a spaceship some day, to go to the moon...

aww man let him spend his $18. He'll feel guilty if he doesn't, and I think it's right that the first money he spends on bitcoin is his own. It's very empowering.
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:49:10
How widespread is bitcoin usage *really*? Is there an actual black market that uses bitcoin only? If not, what percentage would you say is BTC transactions vs USD transactions?
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:02:21
yeah... idk.
