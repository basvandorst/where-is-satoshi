Without any government influence whatsoever, you are not going to get a free market. You will just get rent-seeking monopolies ensuring that there is no competition or freedom in the markets.
Yes government is full of inefficiencies, conflicts of interest, wasteful spending, over-taxation, greedy public sector unions, etc, but the only real world solution is a compromise of various ideologies, not some absolute.

Look at the log graph after the last boom and bust.
Usually parabolic/exponential gains then crashes dont just repeat, it goes sideways for a while, then people forget, then eventually they'll remember what BTC is and get greedy, rinse and repeat.
Been happening with various asset classes for centuries.

I always took it as "without without regard" :/

Societal collapse? No, probably not immanent, but you never know.
Recession? Inevitable, probably within a couple years.
We are a year or two away from the longest Bull Market in history (since Jan 2009). Equity valuations are crazy.
But, trying to time a downturn ain't easy. I remember the 2008 crash was slow motion, there were rumbling since 2007 about dire problems in housing.

Don't think that any Trump appointees will be keen to endorse something that certainly does threaten established global financial interests.
His cabinet is mostly finance, big business and old money- Mnuchin, Wilbur Ross, Rex Tillerson, Betsey DeVos. These are not people looking to shake up the established order.
That, as much as the KYC/manipulation concerns, is what this really comes down to.
Of course they don't want to further enrich a bunch of early adopter tech geeks and common people, or to legitimize a decentralized payment and value store system that is out of their control. They do not want the people keeping any portion of their wealth in Bitcoin instead of fractional reserve bank accounts, bonds, equities.

I hope we get to 2K again, fire sale prices.
