What are the implications for people trading on established exchanges like Coinbase or Gemini? Can BoA try to shut down these exchanges? Do they have a chance of winning?
@_date: 2018-08-29 04:05:37
Done. You gotta front me the 10K BTC though.

Yeah OPs statement is pretty arrogant.

Are these sudden spikes in fees related to segwit? Noob here...
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:34:01
It's cool, but fuck Paypal though.
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:09:40
What?! 9000?!
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:37:06
I'll watch OP eat his left ball if someone gives me 100 BTC.

Aren't the fees for moving it himself around the same as depositing it into Gemini and then withdrawing it into another wallet?
I know that Gemini pays for the transfer fee when you withdraw from the exchange, but doesn't the user pay a fee for depositing into Gemini? Am I missing something here?

It’s tough to rely solely on altruism though. We are nowhere near close to being that kind of society.

There's meme value though
@_date: 2018-04-12 06:09:02
So what about everyone else that had to pay those cash advance fees?

Same boat. Figure the more I read the information on this sub, the more I'll understand it.
Still pretty confusing though.

Gotcha, makes sense. I checked around 6PM PST. Thanks for the info! Hopefully it's the sooner of the 12s.
