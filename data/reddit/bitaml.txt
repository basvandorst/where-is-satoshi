I believe Lawsky is also a speaker at Consensus. For shame.

The apparent direct refusal to discuss your matter and canned language suggests that this is a compliance issue. There is almost never an appeals process for compliance matters outside of the internal AML team. They always have the final say. You probably did not receive a specific reason or more direct explanation because that could expose the institution to potential liability.

Sad news. Get well, Patrick.

The level of denial in this interview is breathtaking.

Great news! This is awesome! I can't help but point out that every mainstream article regarding bitcoin would not be complete without a "dark web" reference. Anyway, how awesome for Circle and the bitcoin community?!

Great job by Jerry, as usual! The education hurdle remains.

Thanks for sharing! It was a pleasure contributing to this article. A sensitive subject for sure. More attention to the issue of "de-risking" and education of bankers can only help the bitcoin community.

Bitcoin doesn't need to say anything...it just does.

Here comes the witch hunt

Is there a petition requesting a presidential pardon of Ross?

I'm hoping states will compete against each other with economic incentives to see who's more bitcoin business-friendly.

Yes, rastanikoten. BTMs must register as an MSB with FinCEN, as well as state-level bank regulators (if required in your state). Some states have exceptions for various reasons. Compliance is the costliest piece; so true. But then again, it's likely the only thing standing between having an operational BTM and a centerpiece on your coffee table.
