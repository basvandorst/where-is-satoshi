Good point! We'll check into that further. In the meantime, do you know if that is a requirement even if one isn't profiting from the transaction? In other words, BTC change is given at some "spot" rate without any fee.

Bought a 20W 12V Solar charger from Yeti Solar. Used bitcoin from our online sales of honey! Keeping the circle going...

We just started selling our honey this year...prior to that we were super small scal and were just giving our modest harvest to friends, families, and neighbors. Plus, we love honey ourselves! 
It's been such fun and great learning experience that we decided to expand our hives last year. So now, we have lots (for us at least!) of honey and are exploring ways to sell it.
So far, we've had very modest sales selling right from our apiary (the fancy word for our collection of hives) for cash. We'd like to participate in some farmer's markets and have been contemplating selling in cash (or bitcoin) and providing change in bitcoin. This would be a great way to get people interested in and owners of bitcoin.
For now, we'd like to get as many sales online and see where it goes from there. 
So, to hopefully answer your question (let us know if it doesn't!), we'd really like to do as many transactions as possible in bitcoin. Since our cash sales have been so small to date, we fully expect our sales to be dominated by bitcoin.
In any case, we do not plan to accept credit cards, PayPal, or other high friction/cost payment methods.

We only sell raw honey. You are absolutely right, that we should emphasize that point more...thanks for suggestings that!
As a start,...
Hey Everyone, this is raw honey we are selling...it has never been heated in processing and tastes much, much better!!!

You won't have to sign for it. 
When we ship USPS we have the option to require a signature, but we typical don't unless the customer specifically requests it.
@_date: 2014-07-31 05:03:13
Wow, that sounds like really interesting honey. Honey is kinda cool that way, the taste profiles seem to have infinite variety depending on what the bees find.
Our goldenrod honey (sadly out of stock until September) has this character. Also, buckwheat honey has a real bold flavor. We don't sell buckwheat honey, but a number of folks do...just give it a search.

Now you have got us worried...we "stole" honey from that hive! If those Italian bees are mobsters like Corleone, they never forget. We'd better be looking over our shoulder. 
Hoping they haven't set up a "sting" operation.

A salute to you, great honey consumer, for buying a 4 gallon of honey (even though it wasn't from us)! More people using honey obviously helps the industry, resulting in more hives, more bees pollinating more flowers....great for our pale blue dot called Earth!
Right now we don't sell more than two pound bottles, but you could always special order it from us and we'd be glad to oblige with a discounted price!

Well, if you want some honey to sweeten your tea, stop by beerbellybees.com and get 20% off.
We are participating in BBB and our online sales accept bitcoin exclusively, no fiat! We also hold our sales in bitcoin...well, except when we buy thing with bitocin!
@_date: 2014-07-31 02:22:46
We still have a family (err hives) of Italian bees...goldenrod is just starting to bloom so we'll have an offer you's can't refuse in September
@_date: 2014-07-31 02:20:57
Yep, Ohio...near Cleveland and Akron!
Go LeBron?! (we're confused around here)

That is a real bummer! Sorry.
Turns out our ecommerce software Magento is known to be a bit slow. So we have implemented some basic optimizations. We also removed an extension for single step checkout that seems to slow the payment processing.
We are still going to try more optimization and if we are still not happy, we will pull up the site by the roots and use new ecommerce software.
Wonder how many orders we lost? :(
Thanks for bringing it to our attention diametric and ozme!
@_date: 2014-08-26 17:37:47
You don't have to force it on the customer, just provide an option. Over time, the hope is it becomes more and more accepted. 
@_date: 2014-07-31 03:19:23
Great question! We don't need BitPay, but the short answer is we are not software experts. Our site is built on the open source Magento ecommerce platform and BitPay has an easy to use plugin extension. 
We've be unable to find an extension for a direct bitcoin payment and programming one is a bit beyond us. We can hardly even spell www! 
We really would prefer a direct payment, would be nice to have our sales entirely self-sufficient. Soon...

Our regular 2 lb bottles of wildflower honey goes for $13 (gotta figure out how we can just present the prices in bitcoin!). So you'd be ordering $97.50 of honey. For this amount, we can surely set up a discount! 
This isn't yet set up on our web site, but if you place an order for 7 two pound bottles, we'll throw another 2lb bottle in the box for you!

Sweet, pure, raw honey from Beerbelly Bees
We take only bitcoin for our online sales. For our "in person" sales, we still use fiat. We also hold the bitcoin.

Haven't thought through this thoroughly but here are a couple main ones...
Pros: Don't have to keep a bunch of change at the market, introduces customers to bitcoin and may make an impression that they tell friends about...resulting in more sales at the farmer's markets and our online store.
Cons: Does this make our tiny honey sales company a Money Services Business that has to register...this is unclear if we are simply providing change at a spot reate with no fees? Also, at first, it would probably down the transaction for people not versed in bitcoin...as mentioned elsewhere in this thread could result in confusion.
@_date: 2014-07-31 03:37:36
@_date: 2014-08-26 17:39:45
Not yet, it is an idea we are considering...there are pros and cons to it.
@_date: 2014-08-26 16:48:35
Related to this, how about an app that provides change in bitcoin for purchases made in cash? As a merchant that sells honey for bitcoin online, we also like to sell our honey directly to customers at venues like farmer's markets. These are normally cash transactions, so require making in change in cash, which can be a pain. Would be nice to provide the change in bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-07-31 05:13:49
Sorry about that...the site can be a bit slow and we are working to improve it. We have been receiving orders, so it is not completely broken, we hope. We'll look at the error logs too.
If I may ask, what type of browser and OS are you using?
@_date: 2015-01-25 21:00:53
Well, well, well, VPN for honey! We sell honey for bitcoin (exclusively!) at beerbellybees.com 
Now I've got to think of a reason to use a VPN. I can buy a VPN for honey and cut out that pesky middleman, Bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-04-07 01:15:32
Yep, we'd be one!
