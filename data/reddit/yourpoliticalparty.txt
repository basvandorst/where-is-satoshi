OH MAN you might be right. Assange has been doing some major things, and seeing how he's trying to get out of the Ecuadorian Embassy in the midst of the DNC fallout, Snowden may be confirming Assange's insurance file in case something bad happens.

It's not YET!! Blockchain is still in its infancy, so oversight/coin tracking only really happens for large transactions. Noboby is going to  spend the time or effort just to track Billy's $25 worth of coin that ended up in a wallet associated with a drug dealer. Still, if an interested party cares enough and has the resources, they can paint a pretty detailed map of coin flow between wallets

Can we also build a blockchain for recording votes while we're at it?
@_date: 2016-04-05 15:05:35
Exactly. It's a lot harder to hide financial information when it's published on a permanent public ledger. **Edit:** spelling

So they're basically a pseudo-bank? I wonder how that works with banking regulations.

We need a blockchain for voting. A distributed public ledger where votes are recorded and public is exactly the solution to vote-rigging
@_date: 2016-05-17 22:48:28
So I have actually thought about that a little. Why dont we assign everyone a voter ID number at birth that isnt public, and they can verify their votes by crosschecking their ID against the public ledger?
@_date: 2016-05-17 21:01:56
Good point. I will admit that attempting to shoehorn could be problematic, but I also feel like doing anything at all is better than doing nothing. We can come up with a better voting system, and if it isn't blockchain, it will be something else.

I'm not saying that capitalism is growing, I'm saying that capitalism is *devolving* into corporatism. What I'm trying to convey is that there has been a transformation of capitalism into corporatism, with corporate interests exercising control of the state and the people, whereas in capitalism, the state acts as nothing more than a mediator between the two.

I think it's more of an anonymity thing. Why even risk using your own voice?

I think this is way bigger news that the tax ban, because it codifies data on a blockchain being recognized by Nevada courts as an acceptable means of keeping records.

I would argue that the current state of affairs is a result of unchecked capitalism running rampant, which I like to refer to as Corporatism (or Corporate Control). The Federal Reserve is run by large private financial institutions, which is why there is always talk of the government seizing the Fed, because the controlling entities have proven time and time again that they cannot be trusted to watch over themselves. We need better checks and balances.
