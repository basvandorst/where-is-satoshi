TBH the headline was for attention grabbing so I can get some good insight from folks. Figured I wasn't too late but the upward trend is so strong for just CY17.  It made me wonder if it was due for a drop or plateau.

Im with you too but I just keep hearing....hodl tight, it'll go back up. Markets go up and down. In the case of BTC, what goes down, must go up :-D

I swear I can't stop learning new stuff on here LOL. So I checked it and it says no transactions, assuming coinbase hasn't actually initiated it. It's also my first transfer out of coinbase so maybe there's something to that?

this looks freaking awesome! thanks man!

Not to be funny but the internet. Like I had heard about it years ago. Didn't do much research on it until it came up in conversation when I was gaming about a week ago.
Why do you ask?
@_date: 2017-06-23 06:39:10
Nah...it's the truth. Pretty obvious no one knows the future. Take it or leave it man. Thanks for the idea though. Just setup weekly purchases. Safer than dumping a lot at once.

Ok I'm new to Bitcoin and wasn't understanding. I see now. Yeah I want to own and control my wallet lol. I wouldn't give anyone else my cash wallet.

Says the guy who started out with corny sarcasm to guy who initially admitted to being new to the whole BTC thing. BTC = Bitcoin in case you weren't sure. 
Chill dude lol. It's Reddit.

Don't all shoot at me at once...but what are the chances this is the end of the cryptocurrencies? Really hoping this is more of an opportunity than anything. Of course I literally started buying 4 days ago HAHA. Only a couple hundred though.
@_date: 2017-06-23 06:53:45
That's what I like just a little LOL man. Were chilling here. Seriously, thanks for the advice.

You mean specifically "parking" is a dumb idea? Is that when you put your coins in someone else's wallet?
@_date: 2017-06-27 04:06:33
Damn, why my bet gotta be paltry? Those words sound offensive. J/K. I'm just learning about it in the last week and was testing the waters, familiarizing myself with it. Thanks for the advice though. Seems to be inline with the general sentiment!

I setup 2FA for my Gmail account but something tells me you don't mean that. Do you mean for my wallet?

Never said I had a lot of trading experience...did I? I said I was in financial talk mode and those are common terms. I'm actually not very familiar with dollar cost averaging. Not here to pretend on Reddit man just trying to learn and get perspective. What's your deal? Bored huh.
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:53:59
Checked out electrum for Android and the reviews are pretty consentual that it sucks and crashes. Any other suggestions?
@_date: 2017-06-23 06:51:36
Dude read my OP (original post). I already said I know that no one really knows what'll happen. So that's proof I'm  looking for insight and not future guarantee from your elves. 
Then you say I'm just trying to save face. It's fucking Reddit. Good for knowledge...not good for trying to build a name or rep so not sure why you would think I would lie about my title reason. Seriously...what's your deal...still don't get your beef here. 
I asked a couple questions most which you ignored and that's fine but don't just pop shit for no reason. Youre here to help or nah. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 06:35:59
Lol well i was in a financial talk mode. CY - calendar year and FY - fiscal year are common terms... you could just learn something ��
