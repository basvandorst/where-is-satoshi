If your grandpa has a limited technology background, he should not be getting involved with Bitcoin for consumer use purposes.
Any involvement from him should be within the highest risk investment category. Investing in people/ideas is the stage. The clarity from consumer facing products has yet to be fully realized.

If he lives in a country with an oppressive government/currency (Venezuela, Russia, etc.), then he should probably put 40-50% of his net worth into commodities, including bitcoin.

There are various ways to purchase and get verified.
I believe it is easier to achieve "instant buys" with Circle than Coinbase. By "instant buys" I mean... after you click the purchase/buy button, you will have the bitcoin in your account within seconds to minutes. Coinbase requires quite a bit of verification to get to the point of instant buys. However, only completing minimal verification with Coinbase, you still get to lock the current market price. It just takes 5 business days to receive the bitcoin with the minimal verification steps taken.
My personal opinion is Coinbase over Circle no matter what. This is based on interacting with support when experiencing bugs, my general perception of their executive teams and their backgrounds, the overall interface, security options, and corporate communications and growth. Coinbase feels more like Google, Circle more like Yahoo.
These thoughts are independent of the debate on how you feel about buying bitcoin through heavily regulated, legally 'legit' channels. That's a separate debate and discussion so if anyone replies, I would appreciate you not making the point "DON'T BUY THROUGH COINBASE THEY ARE THE SATAN".

I think what's curious is the context of licenses, institutions getting on board, the ramifications in doing that, and just general trust/confidence in both the exchange and the legal frameworks.
It appears that Coinbase is about to take a huge step at clearing up that confusion. If that confusion doesn't apply to Coinsetter (or CampBX, or Krakken, or whomever..), then I don't know why Gemini.com and now Coinbase Lunar are making these "first" claims.

Ah, understood. So the thing here is I'm skeptical at how Reddit can pull this off given the regulation/laws that will probably get in the way. But at the same time, I'd be surprised they would hire a full-time cryptocurrency engineer, and let him tweet publicly, if they at least didn't have a loose framework in mind.
Extremely cautious optimism.

@_date: 2015-01-26 00:00:03
OK - I think I'm going to answer my own question:
Coinsetter is not the first US exchange, they're a Canadian company. Read the terms of use: 
And, it appears CampBX is unregulated. I'm reading their Terms of Use now. CampBX has no company/about us page on their website. Here are some snippets from their terms of use:
"Bitcoins are, as set forth above, a new innovation, and apparently unregulated. There has been legislative discussion that Bitcoins could be used in a shadow or illegal economy, but at this time, CampBX is aware of no legal restrictions on the use or trading of Bitcoins."
"In the event that a federal or state regulatory agency imposes new regulations on Bitcoin, CampBX may, in its sole discretion, modify its Compliance program to align with new regulations, or perform an orderly shutdown of the CampBX platform prior to the new regulations going in effect."
"CampBX strictly enforces following limits on Client transactions:
Daily USD Deposit and Withdrawal (Combined) Limit: $1,000.00.
Monthly EUR Deposit and Withdrawal (Combined) Limit: EUR 5,000.00.
Maximum default account size: $9,500.00.
Daily Bitcoin default withdrawal limit: BTC 500."
So a few things about CampBX. They're clearly not able to handle serious fiat deposits or withdrawals. It appears they are operating on the 'Bitcoin is still new and the laws are unclear, so therefore we assume it's unregulated for now'.
From the perspective of trading, there appears to be no benefit to use CampBX over a Bitfinex. You either trade somewhat off the books with a Bitfinex or BTC-E, or you trade legit at Coinbase Lunar.

Individual retail business adoption is insignificant compared to reddit adopting it into their core. There's nothing fundamentally game changing about the companies you mentioned (other than adding legitimacy).
PayPal adopting Bitcoin is a huge deal, but they're being extremely conservative and slow with it. Which is why when we hear rumors of Uber, through PayPal/Braintree adopting Bitcoin, we get excited. Uber would be on the scale of a fast food chain or grocery store getting on board.
Reddit adoption is a bigger deal than PayPal given the tie in to existing behavior already fundamental to reddit (karma, reddit gold, etc.)
EDIT: However, and I wish this would happen, PayPal allowing you to buy bitcoin directly through your existing PayPal account either through partnering with Coinbase, or becoming their own intermediary, would be a massive development.

Repeat this as often as appropriate. What I'm sick and tired of seeing from the Bitcoin community, is the propping up of 'advantages' that are barely advantages from your common consumer's perspective.
Yes, the identity protection is vastly superior when using Bitcoin. However, in order for your average consumer to appreciate that, you'll have to take them back to school which may result in condescending behavior on your part. Unfortunately, society is continuing down the path of less critical thinking. Just to be clear, I'm not saying that people who don't use Bitcoin are not critical thinkers. I'm saying that the identity protection argument for using Bitcoin, is clear, and if that's not important to someone then you can't prop that up as this amazing consumer advantage.
We are in the early PayPal stage. Many people make comparisons between Bitcoin and the early Internet. Even though there is truth to that and some great comparisons, I like to compare Bitcoin to early PayPal. Now, almost everyone I know has PayPal. But for many months/years, practically 0 of my non-technical friends used it which made electronic payments between us nearly impossible.

Tell a story...
* Internet disrupted traditional phone communication.
* E-mail disrupted the post office.
* World wide web disrupted reliance on the traditional content publishing model, and the monopoly publishing companies had over content.
* File sharing (media specifically) disrupted how music and movie companies do business and sell entertainment.
* Money and finance is next, and Bitcoin represents the first significant global attempt at an "Internet of money/value/transactions". Why shouldn't the financial world be just as susceptible to disruption?
EDIT: I hate using the word disruption because of how overused it is, but it fits, and it will fit when speaking to average Joes on the street.

Bitcoin price rises? Please PM me when you witness such an historic event.

In this particular scenario, there are no consumer advantages right now. I fully admit to that. The reasons for the consumer right now are mostly activism and hobby fun. There's no reason for us to deny that.
EDIT: However, let's be clear about something. The number of Bitcoin evangelists is growing. Adding a layer to accept bitcoins in your business opens things you up to a potential new loyal audience. Accepting bitcoins does benefit a certain consumer audience: those who have bitcoin, and are itching to use it. I realize that's functionally meaningless, but it always worth pointing out.

Given the longstanding account history the majority of users will have, I would imagine the scenario can go a couple of ways:
* 0 confirmation payments with backup cc.
* Account age/history determines WHEN you can start paying with bitcoin.
I don't think Uber wants to host a wallet. So there won't be any depositing of bitcoins into your Uber account.
We're talking about $10-$15 charges as the usual fare. Uber is in a good place to take that risk and not require any confirmations.

What makes Circle better than Coinbase? From my perspective, they reflect the same part of the spectrum in terms of being fully regulated and you giving up your privacy to do business with them.

I agree with your clarification, and agree with your perspective on development specifically.
I'm definitely reaching and potentially making unfair conclusions. But, seeing a person submit his own tweets to reddit, multiple times, titling them in the third-person, and none of them get any traction, is a really bad sign IMO. I would short the Coinsetter stock if they were a public company.

My subjective conclusion.
If this happens, reddit adoption would be by far the biggest and most practical development for Bitcoin to date. What Reddit has come to represent to Internet culture and community is extremely important. We will never see $160 again.

I disagree with your inference. A similar argument could be made towards your statement about doing everything in-house. When doing everything in-house, you run the risk of having blinders on and not being able to take an objective view of the technical/security situations at your company. The problem isn't 3rd party vendors, the problem is properly assessing their skill-sets and knowing how to make best use of their services.
Side point: Tweeting this could be interpreted as a desperate attempt at PR... and may demonstrate a rather prideful IT team, which would raise red flags if I kept money with your company.
@_date: 2015-01-29 19:22:37
From my perspective, Bitcoin is supposed only cover the fundamental needs of 'digital cash'. It isn't supposed to provide this solution.
As Bitcoin companies evolve, an arbitration/escrow/merchant-handling intermediary leader will arise. Then, when paying for significant items with Bitcoin, consumers will look for the "badge" or "verification" element on a given business website.
Similar to how it is now. I don't mind blindly doing personal transactions, or even small purchases online. The transaction size and item purchased dictates how I vet the given online business's credibility. I never enter into online credit card transactions with the attitude of "oh I can just do a chargeback so it doesn't matter if I ignorantly purchase goods online without any critical thinking".

I like these guys overall. They're genuinely interested and generally advise on the right Bitcoin fundamentals.
However... they often come off very amateur. Coming off amateur is fine when you're the stereotypical techy/dev type, where the "nerd" shows but the passion that is generally coupled outweighs the horrible communication skills.
But, with these guys... they're actual lack of experience with anything practical (starting things from scratch with minimal funds, NOT having a history of always being the boss and working up the ladder at various companies, etc.) shows all too often.
I'm being superficial here. But I'm very skeptical of the Winklevii brand when it comes to general public's perception.
