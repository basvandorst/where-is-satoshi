OK..I can see governments implementing their own cryptocurrency in which they will be able to track and trace all transactions and outlawing all other Cryptos.

Don't you think if mass adoption were to occur governments would simply outlaw bitcoin as they wouldn't be able to tax the transactions and thus would it's value become well nigh worthless except for transactions on the darkweb??

I think it will dip to at least $3000

Yeh when I first started typing I just automatically double spaced after a period without anyone teaching me. Then in High School I noticed no one else was doing it so I stopped it.

It may survive but it will be worth very little when the majority of governments ban cryptocurrencies.

Yes governments will ban it as they won't be able to tax it effectively
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:56:57
I hope so, then I'll think about buying in.
