No one in the real world cares about Bitcoin

I can see these new coins backed by legitimate businesses like Amazon or Citigroup, but have stable value and certain consumer protections so that you get reimbursed if hackers steal your password.

Perhaps. But what would? Currently, Early adopters want to dump their coins to Tim Drapers of the world without moving the price.  I  think a break in confidence that someone will buy the coins with real money will cause the value to pancake. 
My bet is something terrible happens to the Unregulated exchanges a la Mt Gox 2, or the encryption protocol is broken due to holes in the code.

Closure of Bitcoin wouldn't look like an outright ban. This is the USA.  Closure would be more tricky through onerous regs that crash the value of the coins by 80%, and then the holders would walk away from the bloodbath for a few bucks.  Something new, based on the Bitcoin idea, which has some good ideas, will emerge but be built to incorporate all the government concerns to make the digital currency safer for people like your momma.

Id rather get paid in US dollars than Bitcoin. Very few places take Bitcoin and the prices gyrate wildly.

I'm short gold and a US dollar bull with rising interest rates. 
Bitcoin, gold, and silver are bets. My checking account isn't. It stays the same, it is "money."  You need to convert your Bitcoin and gold to dollars to spend at McDonald's, you could make or lose money based on prices at the time.   That's a bet most people can't afford to take with their day to day cash account.

I think Bitcoin will ultimately be dead because governments will shut it down.   With no government support, you don't know if someone will accept your coins for at least what you paid or trade your coins for equivalent goods and services. Ultimately, private parties will stop trading the coins after government shuts down Bitcoin in the name of consumer protection. There will be no bailout, the public doesn't care about Bitcoin.  That being said, Bitcoin is a form of gaming, and I'll play once it goes down big, to catch the dead cat bounce.

The "price" of Bitcoin is manipulated by the large bitcoin holders, artificially scarce supply, and websites like Coindesk and Reddit posts that pump the string of letters and numbers as money.  Bitcoin will be regulated or the big holders will take a dump, and I think alot of people will get hurt.  Think Mt Gox but much bigger.  System wide.

I'm buying USO etf instead of Bitcoin.

Where is the demand for bitcoin going to come from? I fail to see the consumer benefit over credit cards for online transactions other than the lower transaction fee for the merchant which may translate into slightly lower prices for the consumer. I don't see a lot of non tech people trading insured bank accounts for the Wild West of uninsured paper wallets, blockchain, and bitcoin exchanges in Slovenia.  I don't see wide scale adoption without consumer protection and govt regulations.  I only see the same promoters pumping Bitcoin to the rest of us.  I'm waiting for lower priced bitcoin.  It's heading down.

I agree. People talk about Bitcoin like it's a stock or other financial investment. It's just a computer program run over a network. People are paying real money for nothing but the hope that someone else will pay more than you did.

I don't see the consumer benefit in using bitcoin.  Lower transaction fee for the merchant may translate into slightly lower prices for the consumer.  I get that.  But we aren't talking about big dollars.  But you have to convert your USDs to Bitcoins, and then go buy things with Bitcoin just to save 3%-5%?  I don't think Bitcoin will go mainstream without more consumer protections, which will cause the savings to disappear.

I'm waiting for Mt Gox / China lows. Bitcoin has already lost all its steam after the Silk Road auction   I think Bitcoin is buyable again in the low $300s to mid $250s.  I think that's where demand is OK to limit downside risk. Don't be a hero here, Bitcoin is losing steam fast as more proposed regs hit the wires from all sides.

In a panic, the guys who get out first recover more value than the fools who remain in the burning theater.

Bitcoin isn't property that is recognized as such by the sovereign.  Bitcoin is similar to a coupon or gift card but it's different in that it's decentralized with no financial backer but its users. The only reason people buy it is that they believe that you can trade the digital password for more money and property than you paid for it.  The savings and the payment "technology" are quite ordinary. It depends on the modified ponzi scheme from continuing. Once you run out of new people to put up more and more money for each coin, the smart money will head for the exits, and it'll all end in tears.
