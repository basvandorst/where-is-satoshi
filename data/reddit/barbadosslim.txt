Yeah, because you've never encountered a legitimate anti-bitcoin argument.  Right.
Either you are correct, and bitcoin is flawless.  Or you are a zealot unable to honestly summarize arguments against bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:42:36


So can you summarize a legitimate argument against bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-26 17:00:44


That's pretty bad if it's supposed to be a currency instead of a tulip-like commodity.
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:29:14
What the fuck are you talking about
@_date: 2014-03-03 00:24:30
This is a problem in the bitcoin community, right here.  The inability to even summarize anti-bitcoin arguments.  Really quick to dismiss dissent.
@_date: 2012-12-15 01:22:01
That's not introspection, introspection would be where you look at disadvantages to using bitcoin and then post those.
It would be like if I asked, "Why do people hate me?"
Option  If I am being introspective, I come up with a list of things I do that annoy or hurt people.
Option  If I am not being introspective, I list all the things about me that I think are great and then say that it just intimidates other people.
Your argument has picked option   It's just masturbatory, and it doesn't try to get at why people actually might not like bitcoin.
I don't understand why you keep saying that no one will address your argument.  Your argument is flawed.  I'm not calling you dumb or evil or anything, I'm just saying that your argument doesn't work, and explaining why.  This is not an ad hominem.
Lastly, pointing out that your argument is based on a strawman is a valid rebuttal to an argument.

lol if you only talk to people who "get" bitcoin then you're gonna be lonely
@_date: 2012-12-15 01:34:20
Well, when someone asks you why someone might not like something you like, that is an opportunity for introspection.  Otherwise you come up with inaccurate and masturbatory explanations, e.g. that your thing's greatness just intimidates other people.  This is what you have done.










Your quote skipped the part where I pointed out the flaw in your argument.  I showed that it is based on a strawman.  This is addressing your argument, because an argument based on a strawman is invalid.  Why do you keep saying that no one will address your argument?
@_date: 2012-12-15 00:46:36
That is addressing the argument.  The argument for bitcoin in this comment thread is that people are afraid of bitcoin.  This does not seem to reflect reality.  It seems to be based on a strawman of people who dislike bitcoin.
@_date: 2012-12-15 01:47:35
But I explained why your argument was a strawman.  It was because of the lack of introspection where you put pro-bitcoin people on a pedestal and don't even consider anti-bitcoin people capable of thought.  This is central to your argument, because it is the basis for all of the reasons you've identified why people don't like bitcoin.  And it is a strawman, because people who oppose bitcoin are not incapable of thought.  It's also namecalling, invalid, illogical, and a bad argument.
You were pretty close to being intellectually honest in your original post here:


Because you almost said, "People might not like bitcoin because they think it can be used to launder money or for anonymous transactions involving illegal goods."  But you didn't.
And there's this:


I doubt many people ask themselves this, just because many people would be able to answer this question to themselves very quickly.  It does not seem like you have really tried to put yourself in the shoes of an opponent to bitcoin and really identify problems they might have with bitcoin.


Now it's just turning into a conspiracy theory where everyone is aware of your narrative of what's going on and consciously trying to keep a freedom hating government in place.


This is not grounded in reality at all.  You made it up.


This is also a logical fallacy called poisoning the well.
I have addressed your argument.  It is invalid.
@_date: 2012-12-15 01:10:42


That's literally the point he just made about why your argument sucks.  It just builds a strawman of opposition to bitcoin where opponents are unthinking and fearful people, and proponents of bitcoin are the enlightened few.  That is addressing your argument.  The flaw in your argument is that it's a strawman argument.  It is an invalid argument.  It does not work logically.  One could not use it to draw reasonable conclusions.  It is based on flawed premises.  It is a bad argument.
@_date: 2012-12-15 02:02:39


See, this is namecalling. That is exactly and precisely an example of a nonresponsive reply. You are avoiding the argument by calling it names.
Absolutely 100% wrong.
It's not namecalling, it is pointing out a negative aspect of your argument.  I get to do that.  It's the conclusion of my argument, that your argument is bad.  It's bad because it's masturbatory.  I gave examples of it being masturbatory.  I gave an analogy to show why masturbatory arguments lead to wrong conclusions.
You are being extremely intellectually dishonest, especially given all the namecalling in your arguments.


Ah hah!  You didn't actually say this before though, you just said that I hadn't responded, which wasn't true.
Anyway, it follows logically as I gave with examples [here](/ and [here](/  See it follows, because the non-introspective thinking leads you to believe wrong things about your opponent (this is the strawman), and therefore identify the wrong reasons that might lead someone not to like bitcoin (this is why it logically follows that your argument is invalid if it is based on that strawman).

I'll take that action for .01 bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-03 13:44:43
u guys know bitcoin is fiat right
@_date: 2015-03-19 04:50:43
Yeah the libertarian classism is pretty bad but you have to admit that so is paying taxes that go to mass murder.
"Poor people are stupid, single moms are leeches, and we shouldn't burn people to death with napalm."  &lt;-- literally not the worst platform ever

I haven't seen growth like that since Dutch tulips.

But if it's value is increasing why would you use it for buying shit instead of like us dollars

Fuck you

So sell

I thought it was supposed to be a currency tho.  It seems to be deflating pretty hard
