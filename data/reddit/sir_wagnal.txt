The HKD is pegged to the USD, so it is bizarre that the Supply will not accept HKD. It's cheap and easy to convert between the two currencies in Hong Kong.

Came to r/Bitcoin for my daily dose of Bitmain FUD. Was not disappointed lol.
@_date: 2018-09-20 19:37:29
No. Read the whole report. This is just a little snippet of text which is being clickbaited by Coindesk/Bloomberg, the usual suspects. The report is overall positive and fairly balanced.
@_date: 2018-09-20 10:06:02
Personally I thought the review wasn't that bad.
@_date: 2018-09-20 17:42:15
This. It's a helpful report and it's not at all negative/accusatory. Unfortunately the media in this space is so pathetic that we can't rely on them as a secondary source.
It is what it is to a certain extent. In a bear market everybody likes the idea that they must have been manipulated, so it makes for easy hits. Nobody wants to think about those 20 baggers they failed to cash in on.

An exchange that doesn't let you withdraw coins or cash. That's one f*ked up exchange!

Heads up, you can trade your frozen goxBTC for realBTC. 
Current market rate is about 75%. Expect this to fall if Gox don't say something encouraging today...
See here: 
The reason this is possible as internal transfers still work. In other words, members can "withdraw" BTC to another Gox wallet address, as long as they don't click "open transaction".
@_date: 2014-02-20 10:25:03
Those two nimrods freezing their balls off on a concrete step must have caused a huge security threat!!
@_date: 2014-02-10 08:51:29
Ummm no. There is no TOS preventing Gox members from withdrawing bitcoins to whatever address they like.
@_date: 2014-02-22 16:28:07
Another pointless thread is pointless.
@_date: 2014-02-07 09:57:03
But everyone has known for many months now that you can't get cash of of Gox... I wouldn't call it "recently".

We'll they've made the announcement. Blah blah no time frame.
@_date: 2014-02-10 08:49:05
Their modus operandi is to make releases just before they leave the office. Expect them to post something banal and vague in like half an hour.

Still waiting to hear from a single human that still uses Gox. Where are you people?
@_date: 2014-03-07 12:40:32
I'm with you.
Despite the best efforts of people, after a while/with enough divisions and movements, it will be too-hard-basket... dozens of blockchain links and innuendo...
@_date: 2014-02-10 09:54:30
LOL, you are making stuff up. It's simply a BTC withdrawal.
@_date: 2014-02-10 13:53:30
Well obviously there's a delay involved. An indefinite one. The question is, what's your threshold? If I give you 5% extra, are you willing to take my goxBTC? What about 10%?
@_date: 2014-09-22 06:15:52
The company has always been based in Shenzhen. When they first opened, they created a shelf-company in Hong Kong (with a Hong Kong address in Central). They even obtained a money transmitter license and opened a buy/sell service. However, they were never able to establish banking relations in Hong Kong and eventually lost their license, and decided to dump the buy/sell service. The company is now incorporated in Seychelles and still operates out of Shenzhen (LuoHu District). 
@_date: 2014-02-10 10:17:31
Heads up, you can trade your frozen goxBTC for realBTC.
Current market rate is about 75%. I'm pretty sure this will fall further in light of today's underwhelming press release.
See here: 
The reason this is possible as internal transfers still work (as they said in their statement). In other words, members can "withdraw" BTC to another Gox wallet address, as long as they don't click "open transaction".

My thoughts are with his family but not so much Ross. I find that most of the support he is getting in this thread is ingenuine. Compare him with the slightly overweight, snidey, E-cigarette smoking scammer behind Moolah. Almost everyone on reddit would be delighted if he was thrown behind bars for the rest of his life. But not so for Ross. It seems you get a free pass around here if you're articulate, good looking and spout a few profound-sounding libertarian statements.
Ultimately he chose to build a drug empire rather than something else more productive. The world is full of examples of wasted talent e.g. Aaron Hernandez. At one point or another, almost all of us here have had the opportunity to take the easy way out and build wealth through illegal means - but we didn't.

I don't care much for all the Libertarian shtick. Ross deserved a lengthy sentence. But life is too severe; he is surely a good candidate for rehabilitation.

They have no viable business model unless they start charging fees. They have a lot of wages to pay. Interesting times ahead in China.

So ummm you put up with the worst of it. Now BFX is practically in the clear and noone is talking about them anymore. And you decide after this, to resign? There's no logic to your decision, it sounds like you're only telling us half the story. But good luck anyway.

There's a significant chance this thing is still going ahead and will get some traction. It's still trading at 2-3% on Bitfinex.
I would not rule out Segwitx2 getting interest later, considering that scaling still hasn't been solved...

95% of Bitcoin usage is related to gambling already, in the context of leveraging. It might start to shift towards sports betting and casinos and stuff but it's still the same pool of people.

You don't understand. Whether or not you actually "buy" ETH or LTC or whatever doesn't matter. Once you put up the margin order, you are in fact borrowing the BTC and are paying interest. They are in your possession and you are indeed entitled to the corresponding split coins.
I did this during the BCH fork and can confirm it works this way.
The only question is whether it's worthwhile. Loans will spike 3-4-5% in the 1-2 days before the fork.

But it doesn't really solve your money laundering problem... You can't bring the money back into the banking system.
@_date: 2015-04-30 06:30:09
As stated I had a small investment, enough to keep an interest in the business but not enough that I'll lose any sleep.
IMHO to go from a break-through exchange to one that abandoned its core business and now has almost zero trading activity is most certainly blowing up one's business...
@_date: 2015-11-11 00:26:11
So your volume pumping bot went haywire and you shut down withdrawals while you reversed all of the unfavourable trades. Then you can on Reddit claiming turbulence. Cool.

Ummm looks like a plume of weed smoke.
Imma get high and gamble on Kraken.
How will you deal with system assumed losses?
@_date: 2017-07-07 11:05:43
They stated that the person borrowing the coins is entitled to the split tokens. It's on their website.
"What if I have my Bitcoin on loan at the time of the fork?
If you have Bitcoin on loan at the time of the fork, you do not have it on balance and therefore you cannot receive corresponding Bitcoin Unlimited.
Why not?
When someone borrows coins, they typically borrow them to sell immediately on the spot market to counterparties who cannot possibly be aware that the coins they bought came from someone who borrowed them. Spot traders unambiguously own their purchases, and are the rightful recipients of the coins on the new chain and they can do with them what they like, whether that is selling them to others or taking them off of the platform entirely.
The terms of the loan dictate that you will receive the same number and type of coins you loaned within X days plus the agreed upon interest.

Is Kraken the only exchange supporting the fork?
