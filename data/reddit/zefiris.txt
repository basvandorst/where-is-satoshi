The BIP 70 Payment Protocol is based on the same system of SSL certificates that websites use. If you own a domain name, you can buy an SSL certificate and use it to sign a Payment Request. Wallet software can then show the user who signed the request.
It's true that bad guys could try to register fake company names, e.g. in the same way that scammers buy misspelt domain names. However, the SSL issuers do extra validation before they will issue a certificate containing an actual business name. So e.g. if you apply for a certificate for "B1tPay, Inc.", they will refuse to issue it.

What about 100 satoshi = 1 hecto-satoshi or "hectoshi"?

Yes, they are different companies. BitX (bitx.co) is the company that raised this USD 4M round.

It doesn't require segwit, which means it's already deployable.

You'd still have to do an on-chain transaction if you want to move coins to your own private wallet. Moonbeam channels are only really useful when at least one side of the channel is a multi-user platform.
Unidirectional channels are technically much simpler than bidirectional channels, especially without segwit. Simplicity is quite important since payment channels haven't been used widely in production before.

Well, it certainly isn't *just* a REST API - there are also timelocked Bitcoin transactions, blockchain monitoring, name resolution, etc. See the full specification for more info on that:

1. Unidirectional channels are a LOT simpler than bidirectional channels, especially without segwit. Since payment channels haven't been widely used in production before, simplicity is really important (more conservative and less surface area for security issues).
2. The Moonbeam system will usually be used between platforms themselves, so end-users won't have to open channels themselves. Yes, the platform opening the channel will have to commit capital up front to fund the channel.
3. We envisage that Moonbeam will be primarily implemented by multi-user platforms, not so much for private wallets. However, it could be useful to open a channel to Luno yourself if you needed to make many payments to many different Luno customers. You can actually test this out right now by opening a channel to 
4. DNS certainly makes routing much simpler. Of course, it does also have issues that need to be mitigated, namely DNS hijacking.

Not yet - that's partially the reason for sharing it here and on other forums. Currently it's being tested on testnet before actually opening it up in production.
On security, there are a number of risks and mitigations identified in the specification:

It's not an either/or situation of moonbeam vs segwit. They're orthogonal initiatives. Usage of moonbeam doesn't prevent segwit from being activated and vice versa. In fact, if segwit was activated moonbeam could perhaps be implemented more efficiently. If segwit isn't activated, moonbeam still works.

Coinbase-to-bitpay transactions would be an excellent use case of Moonbeam. Basically if both coinbase and bitpay were to implement the Moonbeam protocol, then payments could be routed over a channel between them instead of having to send on-chain.

I wouldn't consider it to be an alternative to segwit - If segwit is adopted, there would be a version 2 of Moonbeam that takes advantage of it. But even if segwit isn't adopted, Moonbeam is deployable today.

Moonbeam is an off-chain system built on top of bitcoin - it's not a change to bitcoin itself - so I don't think there's really anything to debate, certainly not in the context of segwit vs BU.
If anything, it could be argued that its existence validates the concept of L2 payments, which is one of the reasons to be pro segwit.

I'd recommend trying out the client first. It's easier to run since it doesn't need to connect to a bitcoind instance. You will need a testnet wallet though to fund the channel.

1) How do you deal with Nigeria's exchange control regulations? Isn't that a problem when transferring value between countries.  Indeed, how can you buy Bitcoin with Naira in the first place?
2) When are you planning to launch in South Africa?
@_date: 2013-05-20 18:33:18
In case you haven't seen these already:
- the South Africa Bitcoin forum [  ]
- the BitX South African Bitcoin Exchange [  ]
I'm involved with both. We're also in Durban!
(By the way, isn't "early 2013" already past?)

There is already an exchange in SA:
